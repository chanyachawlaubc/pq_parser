Abstract: "Cypress Village has the potential to deliver something that doesn't exist in the Lower Mainland," says Ashley Willard Bauman, co-chair of the Upper Lands working group, which prepared the report. "It's a whole new way to live and experience the mountainside, one of the most exciting propositions. And it's starting at the very preliminary stages."

Not too many people are paying attention to what's happening in West Vancouver. That's because most of the change is happening in remote parts of the district, only visible if you're a local driving through.
Geoff Croll, president of British Pacific Properties, has even tried to lure real estate agents over by picking them up in a limousine for a recent open house.
British Pacific Properties (BPP) has flown largely under the radar in its 84-year history as the development company in charge of developing 4,000 acres of property owned by Britain's Guinness family. Until recently, the developer has been moving slowly.
"We have been kind of invisible, which is okay when you're only selling 10 units a year," Mr. Croll says.
The BPP of old was all about single-family housing. The BPP of the future is about townhouses, duplexes and condos as well. Mr.
Croll wants to build apartments that are 1,000 square feet and priced at less than $1-million, featuring spectacular views.
"It's a product we haven't offered before," he says.
Mr. Croll is standing inside the show home for their Aston Hill subdivision, which is part of West Vancouver's Rodgers Creek area.
Of the 20 duplexes built, they've sold six. They aren't what immediately spring to mind when you think of "multi-family." These duplexes are 3,700 square feet in size and priced at $3.2-million. At $875 a square foot, Mr. Croll reasons that it's better value than what you get in Point Grey, which is well over $1,000 a square foot.
To an international market, such as the buyer from mainland China, that's especially good value.
The duplex is aimed at the wealthy downsizer who used to live in 6,000 square feet. But it's still a riskier venture than the traditional single-family house.
Not everyone wants to share a wall with a neighbour, even if it feels more like a big house than a duplex.
But another challenge is that the windy hillside roads make it tougher to entice real estate agents and buyers.
"It's hard to find. It's been challenging," Mr. Croll says. "They are used to a grid system for roads.
This doesn't show up on a car navigation system and some GPSs. It takes forever to get onto Google Maps. So people just give up."
Anyone old enough to remember the historic Hollyburn chair lift will know where we're standing. The chair lift is long gone, replaced by luxury houses with some of the best ocean views on the planet.
There is a lot of parkland, too.
Although BPP owns the land, land use is determined through a collective process, helped along by a working group of volunteer citizens. In talks with residents, they found that trees mattered.
"The main focus of Rodgers Creek was to cluster development areas where it makes sense, and save the rest of it as green space," Mr. Croll says. Roughly 55 per cent of the area is protected green space.
Over the decades, BPP has sold off or developed about half their land holdings. They've got about 1,000 acres of developable land.
The other 1,000 acres or so is above the 1,200-foot elevation line, where development has long been out of bounds. But 1,000 acres is a lot of land to develop - the size of Stanley Park.
In 1931, the Guinness family purchased the land for $75,000 and then invested $1-million in infrastructure. The Olmsted Brothers designed the first British Properties subdivision. They were the firm that designed New York's Central Park. And of course, the company also helped finance the Lion's Gate Bridge and built the Park Royal Shopping Centre in 1950, to help grow the area.
Throughout the decades, BPP mostly sold off serviced lots of land to developers for various subdivisions. They rode the market highs and lows, including the ultra low recession of the 1980s.
The company is still family run, with four Guinness family members on a board of eight.
"We are a very small part of their overall business interests, but they've always shown interest and still care about it."
With Rodgers Creek, the company returned to its roots in house construction. It's a slow process. It took two and a half years to receive approval to develop Rodgers Creek. It takes six months for a building permit and 18 months to build a house.
"There is a lot happening in West Van right now," Mr. Croll says. "And the number of building permits has skyrocketed. People are buying properties with bungalows on big huge lots, and they're knocking them down and building new houses. I think the municipality is a bit overwhelmed with activity, and we get caught in the crossfire.
"They know we're not going anywhere. We don't own land anywhere else. Our business is completely in West Van."
He's got a vision for this environmentally important remaining chunk of land. A mountain trail is under construction to connect Rodgers Creek to the future Cypress Village, which is the key component in making these neighbourhoods walkable, and sustainable.
A council-appointed citizens group has drafted a paper that recommends concentrating density into the future village and increasing preserved park area, as opposed to creating residential sprawl. It would include rental and seniors housing.
"You need to concentrate development if you want to make those things happen," says senior community planner David Hawkins. "One of the key ideas of Rodgers Creek is that it would be a community that would be served by a nearby village. It's been on the radar for a while now.
"You've got a large landowner there, but the municipality also has land holdings, and ultimately it's within our community."
Rodgers Creek has already gone through the community planning process. Now there are a series of upcoming meetings about the future of the Upper Lands, a 6,700-acre parcel of undeveloped land north of the Upper Level Highway. It includes the plans for Cypress Village. The public is invited to give their feedback at meetings on April 11, 14 and 16. Details are on the district website.
"Cypress Village has the potential to deliver something that doesn't exist in the Lower Mainland," says Ashley Willard Bauman, co-chair of the Upper Lands working group, which prepared the report. "It's a whole new way to live and experience the mountainside, one of the most exciting propositions. And it's starting at the very preliminary stages."
Mr. Croll is keen on the village creating vibrancy, but also acting as a destination, with good restaurants and pubs for mountain bikers. His renderings show a Whistler-style retail complex with a public square, surrounded by trees and a killer ocean view.
But it's too early to know how big the village will be, or its precise location.
"We would like to have it planned and zoned within three years," he says. "And then put in a coffee shop within five years from now. That's my goal, to be able to sit and look out over the ocean, and have a coffee there."

Abstract: Richard Kurland, a Vancouverbased immigration lawyer who has worked with wealthy Chinese migrants, said Canada has proved to be a safe place to invest. Mr. Kurland, who said he has had nine clients who were billionaires, said setting up a system like Australia's could prove difficult and ultimately fruitless. "It's expensive, there are too many loopholes, you can get around it easily," he said.

Full text:   The $38-million mansion has six bedrooms, eight bathrooms and a view of the Sydney Opera House - and the Australian government has given the property's new owner three months to sell it amid a crackdown on foreign ownership, a strategy that remains unseen in Canada's booming real estate markets.
The Australian government late last month announced it would charge higher fees for foreign buyers who purchased residential properties, and would fine those who violated its foreign investment rules as much as 25 per cent of the value of the property. It followed that up last week by ordering Chinese billionaire Hui Ka Yan to sell the mansion he purchased in November, arguing the home was bought through shell companies in violation of the investment rules.
But while Sydney's real estate market has been plagued by the same concerns of foreign buyers driving up prices as Vancouver's - the purchase of a $51.8-million Point Grey mansion prompted a new round of West Coast handwringing this week - such a policy does not appear to be in the works here.
Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson said council is waiting on a report from the city's affordable housing agency that will examine foreign investment in real estate, and empty homes. "Until we get that report back, we're not doing anything," he said in an interview.
Mr. Robertson said council is more focused on housing affordability than high-end real estate transactions. "Vancouver has a robust, high-end real estate market similar to New York and London and Sydney, but our focus is on the affordable end of the spectrum, and ensuring that lowand middle-income families can thrive in Vancouver," he said.
A request for comment from B.C.'s Housing Minister was instead referred to the province's Ministry of International Trade. A ministry spokeswoman, in a written statement, said B.C.'s Property Law Act states that Canadian citizenship is not required to buy or own land in British Columbia.
She said people who are not Canadian citizens are also not required to disclose their citizenship status.
"For that to change, the province would need to enact legislation with respect to the registration of these matters. At this time, B.C. does not have plans for these changes in its legislative agenda," she wrote.
A request for comment from the federal government was referred to the Department of Finance. A department spokeswoman, in a written statement, said Ottawa actively monitors developments in the housing market but does not comment on possible policy actions.
Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board was established in 1976 to examine proposed foreign investments, and to advise government on relevant policy.
All purchases from foreign investors require the board's approval, and non-residents are prohibited from purchasing an existing home. But a parliamentary committee in November said it "defies belief" that the framework has been complied with, since the amount of foreign investment into residential property climbed by more than 40 per cent in less than a year. The committee accused the board of a "significant failure of leadership" and noted it had not sought any court action since 2006.
The Australian government has vowed to crack down and issued a consultation paper looking for ways to strengthen its framework. Joe Hockey, the government's treasurer, has said more property purchases will be investigated.
Australia is not the only jurisdiction taking steps to try to slow down foreign buyers. Singapore has raised its tax - called a stamp duty - on foreign purchases of local real estate to 15 per cent of the sale price. The British government, eyeing London's soaring house prices and foreign buyers, moved in its 2014 budget to have its 15-per-cent stamp duty on buyers using a company name apply to a greater percentage of home sales, reducing the threshold from properties worth £2-million ($3.8-million) or more to those worth £500,000.
Richard Kurland, a Vancouverbased immigration lawyer who has worked with wealthy Chinese migrants, said Canada has proved to be a safe place to invest. Mr. Kurland, who said he has had nine clients who were billionaires, said setting up a system like Australia's could prove difficult and ultimately fruitless. "It's expensive, there are too many loopholes, you can get around it easily," he said.
Mr. Kurland said he would prefer to see a national registry of residential property transactions requiring the involved parties to disclose the address and sale price, and prove their residency.
Cameron Muir, chief economist at the B.C. Real Estate Association, said the Australian system is "essentially a tax grab." He said implementing such a system in B.C. would not make housing more affordable.

Abstract: In any case, Mr. [Sam Mizrahi] is making some gestures toward heritage. He asked for carved stone panels from the [Stollery]'s façade to be retained, and will have them incorporated into "a monument," he said, within the tower's atrium space. "Our goal is to build for the next 50 or 100 years," he said. This project is "unprecedented and this corner deserves it."

Is it The One? The new development at the southwest corner of Yonge and Bloor Streets will be sold with that catchphrase, and it will in some ways earn that title.
The design by global architects Foster and Partners is tall, brawny and complex.
The project, which developer Sam Mizrahi and the architects presented to a community meeting Wednesday night, would be the third tall tower to rise at the corner. However, in size and architectural character, it would stand out: The proposal places 72 levels of apartments on top of an eight-level luxury shopping mall, and wraps a grid of structural steel outside its glass skin.
The proposal
The planned tower would be Canada's tallest, aside from the CN Tower, and perhaps its most expensive.
Mizrahi Developments will ask the city for a total height of 318 metres, or more than 1,000 feet, with nearly a million square feet of retail and residential space; the budget, Mr. Mizrahi said in an interview, will approach $1-billion.
The proposal is being submitted to the city this week. If approved in its current form, it would be an exceptionally large building - the tallest in Toronto other than the CN Tower. Yet Yonge and Bloor is already emerging as a cluster of tall mixed-use towers, well placed at the junction of two subway lines.
The developer's argument for height and density will be aided by two nearby precedents: One Bloor East, across the street, is already rising to a height of 257 metres, and the Holt Renfrew redevelopment at 50 Bloor West was recently approved at 230 metres.
Mr. Mizrahi plans to clear the site, including the former Stollery's, and proceed immediately with excavation and construction - leasing out the building's retail space starting in 2018, even as construction continues on the tower above.
The design, by London-based Foster and Partners with the Toronto firm CORE Architects, is a three-part composition. The first eight levels would be retail and restaurant space, and pierced by a public atrium; above that, a box containing the tower's mechanicals; and on top, a tower of condo apartments. The tower would fill about half of the site, tight to the corner. A smaller eight-level box would form the western half of the retail.
From ground to tip, the tower's bulk would be carried by a steel exoskeleton - perhaps coated with bronze paint - that stands around the façades of the tower, leaving the interiors of each level wide open. Each façade would include one or two strips of "winter gardens," semi-enclosed outdoor spaces, instead of balconies.
In drawings, this composition makes the tower feel like a piece of infrastructure - giving it a strange kinship with the 1970s behemoths on the northeast and northwest corners of Bloor Street.
In a strong concession to the public realm, sidewalks around the building would be widened substantially. The public lobby, facing Bloor, would be a 40metre-tall atrium that Mr. Mizrahi hopes will evoke the strong urban space of New York's Rockefeller Center.
The architects
Mr. Mizrahi has made a bold choice of architects. Foster's is among the best big architecture firms in the world. Sir Norman Foster co-founded the office in 1967, and they now employ more than 1,000 people in 14 offices - but continue at a high level of design ambition. The firm's most prominent current project is designing Apple's new headquarters in Cupertino, Calif.
In Canada, the firm has designed the Leslie L. Dan Pharmacy Building at the University of Toronto and the Bow in Calgary, that city's most prominent high-rise.
The developer
For Mr. Mizrahi, the project will be a radical step up in size and complexity. He is best known as the founder of Dove Corp., a drycleaning and laundry chain. He moved back into real estate in 2008, building custom houses in Forest Hill; then he marketed and is developing and building two condo towers on Davenport Road in Yorkville.
He plans to likewise run the construction of One Bloor - expanding his company's staff to more than 100. This is, as he acknowledges, a potentially risky move.
In design terms, Mr. Mizrahi will be stretching even further. The condos he built on Davenport Road are what builders often call "traditional" - in this case, a version of the limestone buildings of Haussmann's Paris, stretched upward and capped in glass.
Their design, by the local firm Page and Steele, is competent at best.
The process
Yonge and Bloor's context is changing rapidly, with One Bloor East and the recently approved 50 Bloor West proposal. The Mizrahi building sits on a smaller piece of land than either of those, and it asks for approximately double the density of either building - but it would also have fewer condo units, 560, than either, and its larger retail area would, the developer argues, be largely served by transit.
On the ground, the demolition of the Stollery's building on the site is well under way and is continuing.
Mr. Mizrahi faced harsh criticism when that 80-year-old building began to fall.
He continues to insist that proper procedures were followed.
Sean Teperman of Teperman Wrecking Inc., the demolition contractor on site, said this week that the city has not issued any stop-work order or cited any permit violations on the site.
In any case, Mr. Mizrahi is making some gestures toward heritage. He asked for carved stone panels from the Stollery's façade to be retained, and will have them incorporated into "a monument," he said, within the tower's atrium space. "Our goal is to build for the next 50 or 100 years," he said. This project is "unprecedented and this corner deserves it."

Mayor open to talks with CP to buy land: Robertson says railway would have to come up with a 'fair-market' price to resolve the standoff over Vancouver corridor

Full text:   Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson says he wouldn't rule out new talks with Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. to buy the Arbutus corridor through central Vancouver, an apparent change in his position on a hot-button issue.
In his previous substantive comments about Arbutus, the mayor has talked about seeking to intervene in the regulatory process on CP's use of the corridor. However, his remarks on Wednesday suggest he is still open to negotiating a deal to buy the corridor if his administration can come to terms with CP - a move that could end the transportation giant's plans to return trains to the abandoned track after more than a decade.
Without being specific, Mr. Robertson said CP would have to come up with a "fair-market" price to resolve a continuing standoff during which venerable community garden plots have been destroyed by CP crews intent on clearing the track.
"I'm not going to get taken for a ride by CP on the value," Mr. Robertson told reporters following an unrelated transit news conference in Surrey on Wednesday.
CP is in the process of upgrading the nine kilometres of track, which was last used by freight trains 13 years ago. That work stopped in October, 2014, after the city secured a court injunction, but resumed this year after a B.C. Supreme Court justice sided with CP.
The company has described the corridor as a valuable asset it has every intention of using for the benefit of its shareholders.
CP has said the corridor could be worth about $400-million as a real estate development, but might sell for $100-million. City officials have countered that $20-million is a more reasonable price.
The issue prompted debate during last November's municipal election, which saw Mr. Robertson re-elected for a third term.
The Vancouver mayor also said the has been in "ongoing communication" with CP over the issue, but there have been no official negotiations.
Asked about the discussions, Mr. Robertson said, "I'd put it in the occasional calls and e-mails category." He did not elaborate.
CP disputed the mayor's claim. "I can confirm that no talks - either formal or informal - regarding the Arbutus Corridor have taken place between CP and the City of Vancouver," spokesman Martin Cej wrote on Wednesday in an e-mail exchange about the situation.
CP has said it will use the track in some manner such as making training runs, storing rail cars and doing welding work. The company has said it would seek the appropriate regulatory approval before launching any use of the corridor.
At the same time, the city has said it would intervene in any such regulatory process to express its concerns about the return of train traffic to the corridor, which is now largely bounded by residential areas.
Mr. Robertson said the city is disappointed at the damage being done to historic gardens and public space that have long been enjoyed by local residents.
But he said there's no business rationale for the city to cut a deal with CP under current terms, accusing the company of tactics that continue "to look like bullying and trying to get a city to move on an unfair deal. There's a lot more work to be done to solve this one. They have got to come off their hard position, which is not fair and not realistic."

Chain Reaction: Canada is rapidly becoming a country of restaurant chains: You either grow or you get eaten. But as Chris Nuttall-Smith writes, it's not necessarily Foodie Armageddon

Author: Nuttall-Smith, Chris

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/chain-reaction/docview/1661872042/se-2?accountid=14656

Full text:   Our neighbourhood rejoiced when a Cuban diner opened up nearby in the fall of 2013. The room was cheery and smartly run, with original, inexpensive cooking. My wife and I often brought our son there for afterschool dinners. We'd have the tostones rellenos or the guava-braised short ribs with rice and beans and house-made hot sauce.
The servers knew us well enough to remember that we had a soft spot for the made-to-order cinnamon doughnuts. The cooks usually nodded hello when we walked in. And then one day the servers we knew no longer worked there and we didn't recognize anybody on the kitchen crew. Everything felt different.
Our little local, we learned, had aspirations of "growing its brand," which is business-speak for building more locations.
It had hired a new general manager who'd come from Milestones, who carried a clipboard and gave the servers table-side scripts to recite. No wonder so many familiar faces left.
The diner in me was furious, but my pragmatic side understood it.
To make a half-decent living these days in the restaurant business, you have to attract and retain skilled staff, manage runaway food and real-estate costs and exceed the expectations of an impossibly fickle dining public, all while mostly keeping prices flat. Worse, Canada's current restaurant economy is what some industry experts call a "steal share game."
"If you're growing customers or dollars in today's market, you are literally stealing a customer from the restaurant down the road," said Robert Carter, the executive director of food service at the NPD Group Canada, a respected market-research firm.
And more now than ever, that restaurant down the road is likely to be part of a multilocation company. Canada is rapidly becoming a country of restaurant chains: You either grow or you get eaten.
In the 12 months leading up to June, 2013, the country's restaurant industry lost 905 independent places, but gained 52 chain outlets, according to the NPD Group. The firm's press release announcing those numbers was stark. "Canadians who love the charm, authenticity and inimitable cuisine found only at their favourite local eatery better hurry and make a reservation," it read.
The takeaway: Independent restaurants are dying off at an epidemic rate, and being replaced by soulless Milestones and Tim Hortons.
More worrying still, the more chains you have, the more chains you get. The entry of a deep-pocketed, brand-driven player such as an Earls Kitchen + Bar or a Joey can dramatically alter a neighbourhood's commercial real-estate ecosystem, putting rents and lease terms out of reach for independent restaurateurs.
What's surprising, though, is that the chainification of Canada's restaurants might not be such a horrible thing.
Your reaction to that statement probably has a lot to do with your definition of a chain.
Are we talking McDonald's here or the wildly popular ("and excellent) Burger's Priest, which has seven locations around Toronto and plans to open one in Edmonton? According to the standard definition - the one the NPD Group used in its latest numbers - a chain is any restaurant with three or more locations. While it's easy to pull out the torches and pitchforks for yet another Moxie's location, I'd bet that many Canadians would be happy to get a branch of Freshii, the 100-location ("and growing) healthy-food company that started with a single restaurant in Toronto in 2005, or a Caffe Artigiano, the Vancouverbased company with more than a dozen locations that makes some of the best espresso drinks in Canada.
I could say the same about Toronto's Amaya, Queen Margherita Pizza, Buca, Terroni and Libretto companies. ("The last four companies on that list all have dramatically raised the quality bar around the city in their own ways.)
That's the thing about restaurant companies. There are crappy, bottom-of-the-barrel chains whose food, drink and corporate cultures are proudly, preposterously backward - who rely on a mix of brute market saturation and Stockholm syndrome-level mass delusion to sell their products. ("Hello, Tim Hortons.) But then I can think of a lot of crappy independents, too. And there are some pretty good chains ("as well as restaurant groups with several distinct brands) that use their size not merely to make more money, but also to do good work.
Few restaurants champion Canadian cuisine as Toronto's Canoe does. Canoe is the flagship restaurant of the Oliver & Bonacini company, which, come to think of it, also owns a piece of Soma Chocolatemaker, to my mind just about the best beanto-bar chocolate company anywhere.
Even Earls isn't so bad. Thanks to Earls, you can now get a pretty good jeera chicken curry or a fillet of Ocean Wise-approved steelhead trout with fennel salad not only in Vancouver and Calgary, but also in Whitehorse and Grande Prairie, Alta. A friend who grew up in Saskatoon credits Earls with turning the city a little more toward the likes of nasi goreng and vegetarian Thai salads where previously steak and potatoes largely reigned.
Jeffrey Pilcher, a food historian who teaches at the University of Toronto's Scarborough campus, has seen that sort of positive impact time and again. Pilcher edited the Oxford Handbook of Food History; his most recent book, titled Planet Taco: A Global History of Mexican Food, shows how the fast-food industry helped many Mexicans discover their culinary roots. In Pilcher's research, he found evidence that many people who started with Taco Bell soon graduated to much more grassroots representations of Mexican cooking.
("Related: How many indie-loving coffee hounds got their first taste of espresso at a Starbucks?
Starbucks didn't shut down independent coffee shops - it created an enormous new market for them.)
As for that chains-killing-independents narrative, Pilcher isn't buying it. "To plot out the data and say that chains are putting independent restaurants out of business, that kind of statistical inference doesn't really hold up because there are so many other factors going on around it," Pilcher said.
In some cases, the independents that go out of business were going to go under anyway because they weren't well-run, or didn't keep up with the times. In other cases, changes to restaurant landscapes are dictated by simple demographics, not by yet another half-hearted Subway turning up.
There is no arguing with how much more difficult chains can make it for independent restaurateurs in search of a space, however. Stephen Murphy, a partner behind Toronto's OMG Real Estate Team, a top hospitality real estate company, said that landlords will almost always pick a chain location to lease their spaces to over an independent one-off; chains typically come with corporate covenants that all but guarantee there'll be no problem collecting the rent.
But real estate pressure can just as easily come from other successful independent restaurants, Murphy said. When one restaurateur negotiates an expensive lease, it drives up the prices for everybody in the neighbourhood. On Toronto's Ossington Avenue, one of the most popular restaurant strips in the city, lease rates have doubled on average over the past five years, from around $25 a square foot to nearly $50. There isn't a single big-box chain restaurant on the strip.
There's evidence, too, that the fears of chains' limitless proliferation may be exaggerated. Chris van Vliet, a hospitality specialist with Vancouver Restaurant Brokers, said the city's Yaletown neighbourhood has become so saturated with chain locations - and the resulting high rents - that most independents have lost interest in the area. "There are a lot of empty spaces," he said.
And diners can smell a chainrestaurant ghetto. OMG's Stephen Murphy and his business partner, Ori Grad, recently got called into a meeting with Cadillac Fairview, the development and real estate giant, said Murphy. The company has realized that the old cookie-cutter foodcourt formula doesn't work any longer. Diners want authenticity and creativity. And so the company is actively seeking independent chefs and restaurateurs to set up in its malls and developments.
The company told Murphy, "Get us more creatives," he told me. "Get us the next generation of top chefs."
As much as independents fear the big, bad restaurant chains, in many areas it's the independents that drive the most farreaching changes. The greatest threat to many of the big-money incumbents in Toronto's financial district lately isn't Earls or the ("as yet unopened) Cactus Club, but The Chase, a lavish and - at the time it was opened, at least - independent restaurant from a group of young investors. ("Thanks to The Chase's success, the company behind it now has four restaurants around Toronto.)
When I was a kid, my family used to go camping in Manning Park, a few hours east of Vancouver. On the way, we often stopped at a roadside diner in Hope, B.C., called Rolly's Pancake House. I kept going to Rolly's through my teens and 20s.
There was something warm and genuine about the place and I loved the handmade, rosti-style hash browns, and the waffles with whipped cream.
I haven't been to Rolly's in a dozen years probably, but decided to look the place up. There's a Tim Hortons in Hope now, as well as a McDonald's, a Subway, a Dairy Queen, an A&W, a White Spot and a Swiss Chalet - this for a town of 6,200 residents. If I were the betting type, I would have bet that Rolly's was long gone.
Rolly's is very much alive, owner Muriel Young assured me when I reached her. The Tim Hortons ate into their revenues for a couple of years after it opened, but then her business bounced right back. The secret?
Consistency. "If you come here with your kids, you will be able to order that same stir fry, or the same Alfredo noodles, or that same hamburger as when you came here as a boy," she said.
When I pressed her about all the chain restaurants around town, she said, "I say it's a free country, and it's free enterprise and there's room for all of us."
I kept that in mind a couple of days later, when I took my son back to La Cubana, that restaurant around the corner. I began to wonder why I was conflating the little restaurant - it recently opened a second location - with a megachain.
We hadn't been in a while and so we didn't recognize any of the servers, but one of the cooks looked familiar. The cooking was actually better than it had been in the restaurant's early days.
After the doughnuts, I paid the bill, and our server, smiling like she genuinely meant it, said she hoped she'd see us back there soon.
I'll never get excited about a Milestones or a Wahlburgers, and I'd still rather drink a cup of tepid gutter water than one of Tim Hortons' insipid brews. But I have no problem with La Cubana, or with a lot of chains and restaurant companies.
"Yup, we'll see you again," I said.

Full text:   Addendum: A Saturday Report on Business article on Stephen Poloz included incorrect information. A photo caption incorrectly described a room where the Governing Council makes its rate decisions. In fact, it is a boardroom at the Bank of Canada headquarters in Ottawa. Also, the reference to one of Mr. Poloz's sayings, about a tree in the backyard, was to Canadians' high household debts and not the real estate market.
Stephen Poloz sits in a boardroom at his alma mater, the University of Western Ontario, on a snowy afternoon in late February.
The Governor of the Bank of Canada has just given his first public speech since shocking the financial markets with a completely unexpected interest rate cut in January. His address has thrown another curve ball, by pouring cold water on the market's widespread assumption that he's about to cut rates again at the bank's next policy decision, just eight days hence.
In an interview, Mr. Poloz is calmly explaining - again - why he's not the reason the Canadian dollar is mired near six-year lows against its U.S. counterpart. But his frustration is seeping through.
"The exchange rate depends on everything. The idea of actually choosing to put it somewhere is beyond concept. It's completely contrary to how we think about how the economy behaves, and how monetary policy is best framed.
"If people can't buy that, and say, 'Well, you're just doing it to move the currency,' I don't know how else to explain it. It's just economics."
As the words echo the room, a staffer checks what the Canadian dollar actually did since his speech less than two hours earlier. It's up nearly a cent.
Such is the increasingly difficult and unpredictable life of the country's most powerful economic policy maker, a seemingly regular guy in a conspicuously irregular position.
The 59-year-old economist was an unexpected but largely applauded pick for the governorship less than two years ago, a former monetary policy whiz kid who had left the central bank in mid-career to gain valuable realworld experience.
That experience would serve the country well as the prodigal son returned to help guide it back to economic prosperity. He had finally landed the dream job he had coveted since his student days.
But the dream has darkened considerably in recent weeks.
Mr. Poloz is presiding over the Bank of Canada at an acutely tricky period of an economic recovery like no other. Seven years after the global financial crisis the Canadian economy has still not found its footing, and danger signs are flashing.
Most notably, Mr. Poloz is grappling with a severe oil shock that threatens to derail the bank's best-laid plans for economic recovery. Sinking oil prices led Alberta's big energy companies to slash spending by billions of dollars and cut jobs, moves that are weighing heavily on growth in Western Canada, for years the country's leading region.
But Mr. Poloz's dramatic, untelegraphed response to the threat - the bank's first interest rate cut in nearly six years - caused confusion and even distrust in the financial markets. As much as the bank felt this harsh medicine was necessary, it may now face a serious and lingering side effect: A loss of credibility.
The sudden decision to ease lending rates in a country already awash in household debt has puzzled the public, which can't reconcile it with the bank's often-espoused concern about the dangers of overextended consumers. And try as he may, he can't shake the persistent perception of some that he's bent on driving the Canadian dollar lower to lend a hand to the export sector, which includes manufacturers, oil producers and others, at the expense of importers.
Some see other mixed messages. Mr. Poloz in the fall ended the bank's practice of "forward guidance" - essentially signalling the bank's thinking on the direction for future rate moves. But his February speech was seen by many as doing just that - strongly hinting the next rate decision would be to stay put, which it was.
"His job instantly became one of the most unenviable jobs in the country," says friend Peter Hall, chief economist at Export Development Canada, who worked closely with Mr. Poloz for nearly a decade at the export finance agency.
The right thing to do
The global economy is struggling through years of subpar growth, and central bankers around the world are under pressure to show leadership with sound policies.
But it's not clear that widespread moves to push interest rates ever lower, even around zero, are working much to stimulate economies.
The Bank of Canada's string of more than four years of holding the overnight rate at 1 per cent was seen as a sign of stability.
The quarter-percentage-point cut to 0.75 per cent in January upset that view.
"It seemed to come out of the clear blue sky. That was not helpful," said Bank of Montreal chief economist Douglas Porter. "It gave the sense that there was something fundamentally wrong with the economy. It's a blow to confidence."
In a pair of exclusive interviews with The Globe and Mail - one a little more than a week before Wednesday's interest rate decision, the other two days after - Mr. Poloz defended his rate cut as the right thing to do. He also disputed the notion that the bank has sacrificed some of its credibility - a currency he himself puts at a premium for effective transmission of monetary policy - by catching the markets by surprise.
"The action we took in January, in our judgment - and this is our job - was to react to a shock to maintain that confidence in our ability," he said.
"I don't regret a bit of it."
He offers an analogy - a device for which he has become famous over his tenure.
"If you go to your doctor, and you say you've had this ache for three months, and it's not right, and he says, 'Oh, you'll be fine' - does that make you feel more confident? No.
"He checks it out and then he says, 'You've got such and such and I suggest you do this.' Then you're reassured, because now you understand it and you have a response. You have confidence in your doctor when he's done that."
Perhaps this central-banker-asdoctor metaphor shouldn't be a surprise from the 59-year-old Oshawa, Ont., native, who had originally planned to become a doctor, before an economics course he took on a whim in his first year at Queens University led to an ongoing 40-year love affair with the dismal science.
When you meet Stephen Poloz - "Steve" to his friends - he doesn't come off as a typical central bank chief. While the string of Bank of Canada governors before him have ranged from reserved intellectuals (Gordon Thiessen) to distracted-professor types (David Dodge) to intimidatingly whip-smart bankers (Mark Carney), Mr. Poloz seems like a regular guy - a smart and thoughtful one, but a guy who could hold court at the local pub or over the back fence as easily as in the corridors of power.
He is a product of Canada. The past several Bank of Canada governors have been educated at the likes of Oxford, Princeton and the London School of Economics.
Mr. Poloz is the first Bank of Canada governor in nearly a quartercentury to have received all of his education in Canada.
His suits are well made but not particularly crisp; the knot of his tie always looks like it's ready to be loosened. He admits that he'd rather be wearing a golf shirt, and he teases staffers who don't adhere to the Casual Fridays regimen he instituted when he took over from the impeccably buttoned-down Mr. Carney. When he gives a speech, he seems more like a kindly father giving the toast at a wedding than one of the most powerful men in Canada. He tends to blend into a cocktail reception, rather than dominate it.
At his late-February speech to a 500-strong crowd at the University of Western Ontario, it's clear he's comfortable in his surroundings and in front of the sizable crowd, which includes friends and academics from his days working on his masters and doctorate in the university's storied economics department in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Indeed, he opens with a wry observation that the well-appointed auditorium, in the 21st century home of the Ivey School of Business, is located approximately where he used to park his 1970sera Pontiac Parisienne when he was on campus.
Humour, Mr. Poloz's friends and colleagues say, is his secret weapon. Leaning toward the selfdeprecating vein, he uses it to win over others, to soft-pedal his point of view, to forge consensus. Throughout his career and in various managerial roles, he has started meetings with ice-breaking jokes or humorous anecdotes, setting a friendly, collegial tone more conducive to open and frank discussions among intellectual equals rather than a top-down imposition of his own views.
But beneath the everyman demeanour, there is evidence of a more intense, driven personality. As a kid, he was an honours student and his high-school valedictorian, a student who "was very upset if I didn't get my A."
Although he plays down the stories, people who knew him from his Western days say he more than once told them he intended to become governor of the Bank of Canada one day. He got his first job at the bank, a summer position in 1978, after one of his Queens professors told one of the bank's deputy governors that he had a protégé whose research had concluded that the bank's own work on the demand for money was "a load of rubbish." And in his early days at the central bank after landing a permanent job following his schooling, he was well known throughout the building as a rising star with an eye on a future senior position. Indeed, when he left the bank in 1995, it was with the belief that he needed to build up experience in the real world if he wanted to accelerate his ambition to move into the bank's upper echelons.
Mr. Poloz's passion, away from the office, is golf. He enjoys reading (lately, science fiction and the post-Harry Potter work of J.K. Rowling) and playing the piano, but he says golf is his favoured activity when he can find the time. And his golf game says a lot about the man with the final word on interest rate decisions. He's analytical, strategic, but once he makes a decision, he goes for the green - no hesitation, no regrets.
Searching for a final consensus
It's Wednesday, Jan. 14, a week before the surprise rate cut. As he always does in advance of a rate decision (there are eight of them each year, with six to seven weeks in between), Mr. Poloz convenes the Governing Council - the powerful policy-setting committee made up of himself and his five deputies - to hear final recommendations from the bank's senior staff.
In the room are Mr. Poloz, senior deputy governor Carolyn Wilkins, and deputy governors Agathe Côté, Timothy Lane, Lynn Patterson and Lawrence Schembri, along with up to a dozen senior advisers and staff members, including the heads of the bank's four economics departments: Canadian, international, financial stability and financial markets.
The staff bring Mr. Poloz and his deputies up to speed on what the latest data, economic models and anecdotal evidence are telling them about where the economy is headed. Among other things, they examine the quarterly Business Outlook Survey, key inflation measures, economic risks and credit conditions.
The discussions that day almost certainly centred on how the dramatic oil price collapse was buffeting the economy - a topic that would dominate the rate cut statement and the bank's quarterly Monetary Policy Report, both released on Jan. 21.
The meeting wraps up around midday, with each staff member, in turn, giving his or her recommendation on what Mr. Poloz should do with the bank's key interest rate. The governor and deputies ask questions and test the assumptions made by senior staff, but they never tip their hand. That's essential to preventing a leak of the rate decision and to leave all options on the table in case new and critical information comes in over the next few days.
The senior officials express a range of recommendations, but as they leave the room, there's no sense that the balance of opinion is tilted toward a rate cut. Indeed, as the Governing Council begin their private deliberations over a light lunch, there's no immediate sense that they favour cutting rates.
Officially, by law, the final decision belongs to Mr. Poloz. But by convention, it's a decidedly more democratic process. Unlike the U.S. Federal Reserve's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee, which takes a recorded vote, Mr. Poloz and his deputies openly share sometimes divergent views, but work toward a final consensus.
His meetings with his Governing Council are more loosely structured and relaxed than those of his predecessor, the focused and demanding Mark Carney. But gradually over his tenure, sources say, his command of those meetings has grown, as long-serving deputy governors John Murray and Tiff Macklem have left in the past year, replaced by Poloz appointees Ms. Wilkins and Ms. Patterson. While he encourages a frank back-and-forth among the group, seeks consensus and spends plenty of time listening, Mr. Poloz still typically gets the last word.
But there's no consensus coalescing in that first private meeting; they continue to hash it out on Friday, and again on Monday. It's only by Monday that the council comes around to agreeing that, given the deepening gravity of the oil shock, a rate cut is warranted.
We'll never know exactly how Mr. Poloz and his colleagues reached their controversial decision; the details of their policy deliberations are akin to state secrets. Unlike the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of England, which publish minutes of their policy committee meetings, the Bank of Canada not only doesn't publish them, it doesn't even record them.
However, we do know what they would have been looking at. Anecdotal evidence from businesses - something that Mr. Poloz has made a higher priority since taking over the bank's reins, putting an added emphasis on surveys, meeting with business associations and regular roundtables with CEOs - was telling the bank that senior energy executives were preparing for deep spending cuts that would put a serious dent in the country's business investment and hiring prospects. And the bank's own economic models, long the bedrock of their decision-making process, showed that, without stimulation from easier monetary policy, an oil price of $60 (U.S.) a barrel was going to severely slow the Canadian economy in the short term and delay its full recovery by at least a year, to 2017.
Even though the council fully expected the move to shock the financial markets, it ultimately decided it couldn't accept that severe a setback to Canada's economic recovery.
But what Mr. Poloz admits now is that the bank underestimated how dramatically the markets would respond to the surprise - swinging almost instantly from an expectation of no cuts to pricing in a near-certainty that further cuts were sure to follow.
That required some significant massaging of the message by Mr. Poloz - first in his speech in London, Ont., on Feb. 24, in which he played down the need for an additional cut, and then in this week's rate decision announcement, which hammered home that point.
"As I said in January, we have more room to manoeuvre if our assumptions turned out to be wrong. What was a surprise is how that became a consensus view that that meant we would continue to cut rates further."
'Dissection of words'
As for any credibility issue, Mr. Poloz says results are what matter.
"Our credibility hinges on the outcome - which is our commitment to the inflation target," he says, noting that the core measure of inflation remains near the bank's 2 per cent target.
"The credibility that actually matters to the functioning of the economy is very strong. People have confidence in that. Just go ask them."
And the dream job?
He acknowledges that it has taken some time for him to get used to the idea that the markets and media put deep meaning into every word and turn of phrase out of his mouth.
"That degree of dissection of words, I probably wasn't ready for," he says. "All those nuances matter. It's not a normal conversation. So we take more care about those things."
And he still says he's right where he wants to be.
"One of my basic values is helping people, making things better.
That was the sense of wanting to be a doctor. Here, I get to do things for a lot more people," he says. "That feeling of being in a position to make things better, to work together for a better Canada, is very strong here. I love that culture.
"As the governor, to be talking out in the world to real players and listening to what their perspective is, and being able to blend that into a dialogue that Canadians can appreciate? I don't think it gets much better than this."
ECONOMIC DIRECTION
The lever : The Bank of Canada cuts the overnight interest rate when it wants to deliver a jolt to the economy. The overnight rate is the rate that big banks and other major financial institutions charge each other for one-day loans.
The reaction (1): a) Lower overnight rates signal the central bank's desire for lower interest rates. Banks respond by lowering prime rates to borrowers. The shift is also reflected in lower rates for mortgages, GICs and savings accounts.
b) Lower long-term rates encourage borrowing and consumption. This boosts the overall level of demand and helps economic growth.
The reaction (2): Lower rates discourage foreign investors from holding Canadian bonds and other fixed-income investments. This drags down the value of the loonie. As it falls, Canadian goods become cheaper on world markets and Canadian exporters benefit. This aids economic expansion.
The outcome : If all goes as planned, the economy grows, helping to close the gap between actual and potential output. This, in turn, maintains inflation at a low, stable level.

This week, the average price of a detached home crossed the seven-figure threshold for the first time. What's a pain to our pocketbooks is a boon for local cocktail conversation. So before heading out this weekend, make sure you don't arrive at your engagement ill-equipped. A checklist:
Give that friend in Vancouver a call for war stories from an even wilder housing market. Just because it's your first time at the dance doesn't mean you can't sneak a peek at the routine.
What have you given up to make your already sky-high mortgage work? Court sympathy with your downgrade from Whole Foods organic tomatoes to the canned stuff from Costco.
If friends are hosting in their semidetached home, don't let them steal your thunder. Everyone knows it's your neighbours who argue the loudest, and you have the thinner walls to prove it.
Consider what else you could do with the minimum 20-per-cent down payment on a million-dollar house, such as help the city fix all those winter potholes outside your house. This is your perfect segue to complaining about Toronto's other favourite preoccupation: traffic. Your companions will adore you.

Full text:   BUILDER/DEVELOPER Minto Communities
SIZE 330 to 1,024 square feet
PRICE $199,990 to $638,990
CONTACT To register, phone 437-836-8586 or visit mintowestside.com
At Minto Communities' latest mixed-use, high-rise development, condo dwellers who want more space to play or impress their guests won't have to choose between staying within the confines of their own suite or paying for cabs, coat checks and cover charges for a night out.
By pushing an elevator button, residents can be whisked off to indoor and outdoor attractions and activities on two floors connecting 18- and 20-storey towers.
"Being situated near King West, right near transit, is really important to the clients we're talking with right now," says Amanda Wilson Watkins, vicepresident of marketing and sales.
"But to have amenities, like a pool, gathering places and lounges that are more what you'd see in a recreational-type setting ... is also important to them to have that inside their own building so they can chose to stay inside their own community."
The concept has created huge demand during previews leading up to this month's official launch of Minto Westside, which will house 660 suites in the first two of four towers at the northeast corner of Bathurst and Front streets.
"The amenity package is phenomenal; it's beyond anything in that submarket right now," Ms. Wilson Watkins says. "So we're seeing a lot of interest from millennials who want to relax and have friends at their place in a setting that's comfortable to them, but also like its own community within a community."
Residents will have input on pay-per-use classes offered at Westside Club, home to a 4,000square-foot fitness and wellness centre with a 2,500-square-foot terrace on the second floor, as well as dining and lounge areas and two courtyards, including a bar and barbecue facilities.
The ninth floor will accommodate lounging and dining areas, both indoors and on the rooftop, where there will also be a bar, reflecting and swimming pools.
"Because the amenities are not all in one building, but two separate buildings, there's a bit more intimacy than you'd see in a building that has over 500 suites in it," Ms. Wilson Watkins adds.
In addition, 30,000 square feet of retail space will serve residents and locals in an area renowned for its dining, clubbing, sporting and live-performance-arts establishments.
"To have an upscale or urban grocer on our ground floor is a huge perk," Ms. Wilson Watkins says. "If you need a loaf of bread or some tea, you can just run down to the ground floor."
In terms of design, the area's original warehouses urged Wallman Architects to give the infill project a geometric, solid masonry shell punched out with varying window sizes to illuminate contemporary interiors by Burdifilek.
Studios to three-bedroom plans will feature open-concept principal rooms with up to 10-foot ceilings, European-style kitchens with Caesarstone counters and engineered laminate floors, plus recessed balconies.
"Floor plans across the city are shrinking in size, so ... we wanted to deliver a good price point to buyers, but didn't want to sacrifice on livable and usable square footage inside the suites," Ms. Wilson Watkins says.
"There are functional second bedrooms and, in many cases, second washrooms where there are two bedrooms, which is not something you see across the board in Toronto."
To meet LEED certification, the building will be outfitted with a green roof, rainwater harvesting, car chargers and bike storage, as well as Energy Star appliances, water-efficient features and heat-recovery ventilators en suite.
Monthly fees will be 59 cents a square foot. Lockers will be $4,750 and parking is $42,000.
Occupancy begins January, 2018.

One blustery winter afternoon not long ago, I visited the 2015 Pan American Games athletes' village on the eastern edge of Toronto's downtown.
It was my first chance to size up what an investment of $700million, the combined effort of public agencies, a private development consortium and four architectural firms, much consultation with neighbours, experts and citizens at large, and the muscle-power of many hard-hatted men and women have done to make livable 35 acres of once-desolate industrial land near the mouth of the Don River.
On the day I was there, the area was beginning to feel like somewhere people will be able to live, play, shop comfortably and well, once the transformation of the village into what developer Dundee Kilmer is calling the Canary District is complete.
The name, by the way, commemorates the Canary Restaurant, a classic, defunct (since 2007) local greasy spoon formerly frequented by truck drivers and the odd urbanite in search of the perfect over-easy.
Five of six planned buildings have been put up and the place's basic material fabric - its network of avenues, its mid-rise atmosphere - has come together. Saplings have been planted and landscaping is well under way alongside the straight, spacious extension of Front Street East, which bisects the site, orients the terrain toward the 18acre Don River Park, and opens the system of new buildings to the city.
The swimming pools and track and basketball court of the handsome 82,000-square-foot YMCA, designed by sports-facilities specialists MacLennan Jaunkalns Miller Architects, are virtually ready for a dip or run or dribble. KPMB Architects' Canary District Condominiums, gathered around a courtyard south of Front, is getting finished, and so are the works by Toronto's architectsAlliance and the Montreal office of Daoust Lestage.
The architectural results, especially the mid-rise steel and glass residential structures already on the ground, are trim, unsentimental, responsible. While the designs will probably break no records for cuttingedge invention, the general sense they lend to this large new urban space is one of open-handedness and rationality, and a palpable, cool decency.
The village will offer the 10,000 athletes and coaches from 41 countries a temporary home that is fresh, youthful in spirit, thoughtful.
For the duration of the summer games, the contestants' digs in these projects will be pretty bare-bones. Five people will bunk into each one-bedroom apartment, or 10 per twobedroom suite. Because the units are expected to get hard use during the sporting events - July 10-26, and Aug. 7-15 for the Parapan American games - the installation of most finishes and trims has been postponed until after the roistering young competitors and their sweaty uniforms and gear have moved on.
Then will begin the readying of the extant buildings for their more permanent inhabitants, and the raising of the last three mid-rises will continue. When the work is done, Dundee Kilmer CEO Jason Lester told me, the Canary District will feature upward of 800 market-rate condominium apartments and townhouses, 253 units of affordable rental housing, a 250-suite student residence for George Brown College, about 30,000 square feet of commercial space for "a cluster of like-minded retailers" in the business of "health and wellness," five or six restaurants and a locally owned Dark Horse Espresso Bar (not another Starbucks, Mr. Lester was quick to point out) on Front Street East's promenade.
Had you said to me, a dozen years ago, that you believed such an obviously real piece of city would be nearing completion down there in 2015, I would have consigned the prediction to the file marked Wishful Thinking. For Torontonians with good memories, after all, the Canary District site has long seemed destined for calamity.
We remember the late 1980s, when idealistic local architects and urbanists, energetic social activists and some city and provincial politicians joined forces and proposed a massive complex of affordable homes, community schools, offices and cultural centres for construction on the derelict property. The scheme, called Ataratiri, attracted wide support and interest in civic circles and in the precincts of power. By 1992, however, its impracticality had become obvious to almost everyone, and the project was definitively canned that year - but not before gobbling down $350-million in public money, and all without producing a single house.
Given the tract's ill-starred history, it was hardly surprising that skeptics were so noisy in the early 2000s, when the public development corporation known today as Waterfront Toronto became the landlord of the waste, designated the property the West Don Lands, and announced its intention to establish a large, thriving neighbourhood on the site.
As I found during my stroll among the new buildings earlier this winter, that wish is apparently about to come true, silencing the doomsayers and boding well for the further revitalization of Toronto's waterfront.

Full text:   SOFTWOOD LANDING
A married pair of B.C. architects tranform a former butcher shop and grocery store into a woodsy modernist enclave. 'We will live here forever,' says Susan Scott, who transformed the space with her husband, David
THERE'S NOTHING MORE British Columbian than living in a home surrounded by woods. David and Susan Scott manage to pull this off in East Vancouver - where the lower level of their residence and studio features walls, floor and ceiling wrapped in oneand-a-quarter-inch planks of Douglas fir. "We had a vision of living inside a wood tube," Susan Scott says. The couple worked directly with a sawyer to select and cut three logs specifically for their place.
In this way, the couple, who launched their architecture fi rm Scott and Scott in 2013, paid tribute to the region's rich resource of softwood and also the local modernist tradition, which has built on the beauty of wood both as a structural and as a fi nishing material. Their starting point was a former butcher shop and grocery store, built in 1911, which had an apartment above. "It has always been built by its owners," David Scott says, "and there are quirky details to how it was constructed: There were old Coke signs that had been bent into flashing, for example. Taking it apart was a neat process."
The Scotts put it back together with great care, testing their design details while doing some of the construction with their own hands. The main floor, which is complete, is carefully composed using three materials: concrete, warm-hued Douglas fi r fi nished in beeswax and black-stained fi r plywood. The black timber defines a threshold at the front and storage compartments at the back, providing a contrast and also a visual frame for the space.
The Scotts also designed a pair of work tables with leather tops and galvanized-steel legs. These facilitate design work as well as homework and also fun: The downstairs space provides room for their two daughters "to ride bikes or scooters," David Scott says, "a lot like a basement rec room." The intermingling of work and home life is something the couple values highly and it also informs their approach to materials and details: They appreciate the value of a patina, and hope that their architecture will improve with time. "We will live here forever," Susan Scott says, "and it will grow with us."
NORTHERN (RE)EXPOSURE
After working in the United States for 10 years, architects Jodi and Andrew Batay-Csorba approached a Toronto building type uncommon south of the border - the semi-detached home - with renewed interest and vigour. The result: an unusually airy urban space with plenty of (hidden) storage
AFTER AN ABSENCE, the familar becomes strange. When Canadian architects Jodi and Andrew BatayCsorba moved to Toronto after more than a decade in southern California, they found themselves fascinated with the fact of the semi-detached house - commonplace in Toronto, but an oddity elsewhere. A modest 1907 example in Toronto's east end became their home and the subject of some wild speculation about what could be done with the type. In the end, the couple - who both worked on complex projects at Morphosis, the fi rm of Pritzker Prize winner Thom Mayne - settled on pragmatic changes that achieve a spare and liveable interior.
In particular, the couple removed interior walls to open the space, but a "thickened wall" of cabinetry, as Andrew puts it, extends along one side of the kitchen toward the central stair, incorporating a coat closet and other storage into one unified slab. Stacking it all together against the party wall in closed cabinets serves the extra purpose of insulating the house against noise from its neighbour. "We even have a coat closet and a shoe closet in there," Andrew says. "To get all those things out of the very small living area makes it feel much larger."
Otherwise, the pair focused on the classic smallspace problems of light and a sense of openness. Openriser stairs bring sunlight through the interior "and that, combined with the glass partition, makes the house feel as large as it possibly can," says Andrew.
For similar reasons, the ceiling is painted with an eggshell finish, and the black tile around the living-room fireplace has reflective qualities.
Clarifying the details helps create a sense of spaciousness and repose. The glass along the stair runs floor to ceiling, without any hardware in the middle to interrupt it. They couple, who did the finish construction themselves, also smoothed out the floor, designing air vents to match and sit flush with the hardwood.
But the most important move, Andrew argues, was containing everyday objects. "There's always a hidden reality in any modernist project: Where do you put all the stuff that we, as North Americans, live with?" Andrew says. "In our other projects, we've incorporated a lot of storage to clean the place up."
A CAREFUL BALANCE To remake a 19th-century Toronto cottage into a home she could call her own, Toronto architect Kirsty Bruce was both ruthless and respectful, maintaining the original floor plans but injecting bold touches
LOOKING FOR HER fi rst home, Kirsty Bruce found the ideal target for a renovation project: a tiny 1870s cottage in a downtown Toronto laneway. As she recalls, ir was "a ruin," leaky, sagging - and the least expensive house in the area. To remake it, Bruce applied her experience restoring heritage buildings and also designing modernist spaces.
Today, the interior features a quiet, Scandinavianinfluenced mix of modernist classics - including a few George Nelson Bubble Lamps - with grey paint and lime-washed wide-plank oak floors. In the kitchen, IKEA cabinets sit alongside custom woodwork, including an array mounted artfully in the middle of the wall. This avoids the challenge of lining up cabinets against antique walls: "In an old house," she says with a laugh, "you can't count on anything being straight."
In her new/old house, Bruce, who now leads the fi rm Bruce Studio with fellow architect Jordan Winters, thoughtfully blends restoration techniques with contemporary touches. She replace the old, doublehung windows on the front facade, for example, with similar ones in black, but, for the front door, chose a boldly modern unit from Bauhaus Windows that is framed in sapele wood. "It's a careful balance," she says, "making the restored part more muted and letting the modern parts sing."
Maintaining that balance meant leaving most of the walls in place. "I don't believe in a pure open plan," says Bruce. Instead, she favours "cellular spaces," as she puts it, rooms that interconnect but have walls between them. "I like niches and nooks; that feels more like a home to me." Her house has a living room, a separate dining room and, linked by a corridor, an expanded kitchen at the back.
This configuration allows each of the spaces, though small, to have workable layouts. It's a lesson, Bruce says, that she has carried forward into recreating other houses with similar proportions. (Another key to the small, narrow house: a vestibule at the front door, with custom-made cabinets and shelves in walnut mounted on the wall.)
While the builders were reconstructing her house, Bruce specified that one of its original studs - a true four-by-four made of spruce - be left exposed right in the front hallway. "The layers of the house are revealed here," she explains. And beautifully so.

Full text:   Even in the age of the smartphone, Canadians aren't ready to hang up on the pay phone.
In a surprising report Thursday, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission said 32 per cent of Canadians used a payphone at least once in the past year, despite the declining numbers of phones available and the ubiquitous adoption of mobile phones.
Still, payphone call volumes are falling by 24 per cent a year, the CRTC said, and phone companies are yanking payphones out at an annual rate that will rise to 15 per cent a year by 2016. Next year, there will be about 55,000 payphones across Canada, about onethird of the number that were in place in 2005.
As the CRTC understated it, in dry commission-speak: "Payphone service is not relied upon to the same extent as it was in prior years."
The CRTC is concerned with what happens to small communities when the last payphone is removed. Since 2004, the regulator has required that a phone company wanting to take the last phone out of a community must notify the local government, post a notice on the phone booth itself, and put an ad in the local paper. Then, in 2013, it put a temporary moratorium on the removal of payphones in any small communities.
Now, the CRTC is asking for public comments on a proposed tweak of the rules that would define a "community" as a municipality or a First Nations reserve, and add the notification provisions to any payphone in a location where there isn't cellphone service.
While the commission acknowledges that payphone use is declining, it also notes it can be a vital service - particularly for Canadians who are "economically or socially disadvantaged." Far fewer lower-income Canadians have cellphones than those with the highest incomes - where mobile phone penetration is well over 90 per cent - according to data gathered by the CRTC.
Payphones are also sometimes used "as a last resort in times of inconvenience and emergency," the commission noted.
For phone companies, however, many payphones are money losers. Bell Canada and Bell Aliant told the CRTC that, in 2013, they had 636 payphones that had no usage at all over a 13-month period, and 10,500 phones with revenue of less than 50 cents a day, on average. Phone companies are not allowed to charge more than 50 cents cash for a local payphone call, or $1 if it is a non-cash payment.
Despite that many payphones aren't covering their costs, the CRTC insists "tens of thousands of payphones are forecast to remain financially viable for the foreseeable future at current rates."
Telus Corp. spokesman Chris Gerritsen said his firm "has always taken a moderate approach to removing payphones, collaborating with communities to ensure the best possible access to the service even as use declines and phones become unprofitable."
A Bell Canada spokeswoman said, "Bell continues to ensure that payphones are affordable and accessible, especially in high traffic locations such as shopping malls, airports, hospitals and other community facilities. We plan to maintain payphones in these locations and many others for the foreseeable future."
The Public Interest Advocacy Centre, which presented the CRTC with evidence of the value of payphones to low income earners, noted that even people who have cellphones sometimes need to use payphones. People who run out of prepaid minutes will need other means of making calls, it said, and low-income individuals often have plans where rates are higher during the day time, so they prefer to use a payphone for some calls.
In an interview, PIAC executive director John Lawford said it is crucial that all Canadians have affordable access to the phone network - and for many people, payphones are the answer.
"Everyone [needs] to have some way of getting on the network and communicating in a way that is affordable and in a way that works for them," he said.
Mr. Lawford said phone companies could also use payphones in more creative ways - setting them up as WiFi hot spots or "dressing them up with advertising" to generate more revenue.
"They are often in good public and semi-public spots," he said. "The ten square feet of real estate they hold is actually pretty valuable."
The CRTC report said most payphone removals are initiated by the owners of the property where they are located, not by the phone companies themselves.

In the eight years since Johanna Hurme and Sasa Radulovic founded it, the Winnipeg firm known as 5468796 Architecture (or 546 for short) has earned fame in Canada and abroad for its signature brand of fresh, practical, intelligent modernism. The practice has also acquired a reputation for doing notably deft designs in difficult spots, and often within very tight budgets.
Until now, however, Ms. Hurme, Mr. Radulovic and their colleagues have not had an opportunity to show what they can do beyond a stone's throw from the intersection of Portage and Main.
Having these promising architects try their Manitoba luck down in Hogtown is overdue. But it's going to happen: 546 will make its very first mark on the ground outside home territory in Toronto's east end, where Symmetry Developments and partners are putting up the 39-unit townhouse project the office has crafted, The Tree House.
Townhouse complexes are nothing new around here, of course. The real-estate fever of the past 25 years has littered the urban landscape with them - a few architecturally noteworthy, most not. As for imaginative energy and verve, we've seen very little in the local townhome market that embodies these qualities quite as vividly as Tree House.
Several things make this project unusual. Sensitivity to site is one of them.
Unlike dimmer townhouse designers, who tend to clump units into tiresome rows and drop them any which way, the architects of 546 have paid very close attention to - even learned from - Symmetry's lot out in Scarborough's old suburban sprawl. Each of their three parallel, east-west blocks of housing offers a unique interpretation of its place.
The expansively glazed, animated structure standing alongside busy Gerrard Street East, for example, is the most steadily focused building in the group.
But it's the public, streetside face that Tree House turns toward the city, so the fact that it behaves with a certain civic gravitas is appropriate.
The block at the rear (south) end of the site, on the other hand, takes its cues from the lot's irregular shape, and from an eccentric little street that comes in at an angle, and dead-ends at the property line.
At least it's supposed to end there. The architects of 546, however, have decided to welcome the odd, diagonal momentum of the street alignment and property configuration, instead of resisting these interruptions of the orderly, rectilinear city grid and plunking down three lookalike chunks of housing. The awkward angular push has driven the layout of a courtyard, and informed the striking form of the southernmost townhouse building, which zigzags off at a tangent from its two more staid companions.
But I don't mean to exaggerate the formal variety here, or make Tree House seem eccentric.
While each of the three blocks has a lively identity, the parts of Tree House certainly add up to an attractively coherent whole.
The strategic idea that holds it together - stacking boxes - is one of the most venerable in the modern movement's repertoire.
But all modernist stacks are not created equal. There's a world of difference, let's say, between the routinized piling-up of exactly identical units in a warehouse - that's how you get the dullest high-rises, but also starkly boring townhouses - and the inventive, push-pull play with variously defined oblongs that Tree House is about.
This play is nowhere more intense or interesting than in the southernmost of the three blocks. Here, the interiors of the three-bedroom townhouses - two in every vertical three-level segment - interlock ingeniously, like pieces of a Chinese puzzle, providing each family with formally distinctive living spaces on more than one floor. The entrances of both the upper and lower townhomes open onto the courtyard. The glass-faced interior volumes - some broad, others oriented upright - declare themselves on the exterior in a bold rhythmic motion, what Mr. Radulovic calls "staggered, cellular geometry," that runs the length of the building.
The art of this development is robust, urbane, big-city stuff.
Here, as in its work in Winnipeg, 546 has put the lion's share of its considerable moxie into an arresting design, but one that can be translated into reality by the trades with entirely conventional materials and methods.
The framework of these buildings will be wood, not steel. The walls, where they aren't glass, will be clad with heavy aluminum panelling, in two tones of grey. Simple. Neat. And dumb, as the word is used in the saying "dumb is the new smart" - which means pretty darned smart indeed.
For the record: developer Sayf Hassan, of Symmetry, told me via e-mail that, in the block nearest Gerrard and the one in the middle, "all units will be a minimum of two bedrooms and two baths, with larger units having three bedrooms and two-and-a-half baths. Unit sizes range from 965 square feet to 1,220 square feet ..." Townhouses in the third structure, on the south side of the property, will vary in size "from 1,330 square feet to 1,610 square feet, and will all have at least three bedrooms, two baths and a den."
Prices start in the mid$400,000s. "Our intent with this project," Mr. Hassan wrote, "was to introduce high-design modern townhomes at a price point that was comfortable for young families, first-time buyers and downsizers."

Toronto, let's face it, has done a poor job of protecting its architectural heritage. Scores of beautiful old buildings fell to the wrecker's ball in the postwar period as the city grew, and glass and steel replaced granite and limestone.
In response to that age of destruction, a vigilant heritage lobby has formed to fight for the preservation of what is left. Its members do great work, documenting the city's built history and campaigning for better conservation regulations and resources.
A report this week by Heritage Toronto, an arm's-length city agency, recommended promoting Toronto's heritage to tourists, appointing a city director of heritage preservation, pushing forward with a proposal to create a new museum of Toronto history and tightening rules to give officials time to assess the heritage value of threatened buildings.
But like members of any campaign, heritage activists need to pick their battles. The latest fight, over the Stollerys site at Yonge and Bloor, was the wrong hill to die on.
The clothing store with its trademark green awnings had been a fixture on the southwest corner of the intersection since 1901. So when a developer started pulling it down last month in a shower of broken stone and shattered plaster, some conservationists and local residents let out a cry of outrage. Why had there not been more warning of the demolition? How could the developer trash a historic building and leave a vacant shell on a central street corner?
In fact, it has been clear for a long time that the Stollerys site was going to be redeveloped. It stands on prime real estate at the transfer point of the city's two main subway lines. Right across the street on the southeast corner, a soaring condominium tower is under construction, with three storeys of new shops at its feet.
Developer Sam Mizrahi, who bought the Stollerys property last fall, says he will not leave it vacant for long. He proposes to put up a dramatic 80-storey tower designed by renowned British architect Norman Foster.
That would help bring new street life and architectural distinction to an important crossroads.
Toronto's official plan calls for more density and high-rise construction at key hubs that are well served by rapid transit.
Bloor and Yonge is just such a hub, ripe for city-building. It would be a shame for one structure to stand in the way of that evolution.
It would be different if the corner had been occupied by an old church or ornate Victorian bank. In truth, Stollerys was a rather poky place, much adulterated over the years. A squat modern addition in smoked glass added a third storey. It had some nice features, like the arched second-storey windows, but no one would have called it an architectural gem. Perhaps for that reason, no one sought to give it protected heritage status until the last minute, when local city councillor Kristyn Wong-Tam tried to intervene.
Critics say all they wanted was a chance to have Stollerys at least considered for protection. Fair enough.
With scant staff and resources, city preservation authorities cannot keep an eye on every endangered building. The city needs to find a better way to flag heritage sites before demolition ends any debate.
But fights such as these often end with some awkward compromise, like preserving a chunk of building frontage - the dog's breakfast known as façadism. Better, in this case, to build something new.
The great buildings we construct today are the heritage of tomorrow's Toronto. A city growing as fast as this one needs to find a way to embrace the future while respecting the past.

LISTING AGENT Mary Jo Vradis, Royal LePage Estate Realty .
The Action : The historic family homestead of a brother of Scarborough's first settler sits on a winding street lined with private residences, such as this original bungalow right across from Thomson Park. With the absence of other local options for sale, it was scanned by about 50 shoppers during private tours and public open houses until seven fought to present their best price.
What They Got : This nearly 60year-old brick bungalow has a classic kitchen, fireside living room and dining area with a walkout to a deck, shed, private driveway and fenced 77-by-180foot grounds.
To retire for the night, there are three bedrooms, including one with a secondary deck and two sleeping quarters in the basement, along with a recreation room and second full bathroom.
The Agent's Take : "It's a very unique property in a prestigious part of Scarborough," says agent Mary Jo Vradis. "One of the big selling features of this neighbourhood is Thomson Park."

Full text:   When the federal government tightened mortgage rules in 2012, overheated condo markets in Toronto and Vancouver were widely seen as the main target.
But little more than two years later, it's many smaller cities that are bearing the brunt of stricter regulations.
Winnipeg, Montreal and Moncton are grappling with a surplus of unsold condo units driven by a surge in new construction and a dwindling supply of first-time buyers in the wake of Ottawa's decision in June, 2012, to limit mortgage insurance to amortization periods of 25 years or less from 30 years.
While deep-pocketed investors in Toronto and Vancouver stepped in to fill the void, the picture has been different in smaller markets where condo sales are driven largely by firsttime buyers.
"It definitely had an effect on first-time buyers," said Paul Cardinal, manager of market analysis for the Quebec Federation of Real Estate Boards.
"What's not really intuitive is that you would have thought the most expensive markets would have been impacted more than the less expensive market, but that's not necessarily the case."
The downturn has been most painful in Quebec, where the boom in condo construction started in 2011 and 2012 as young buyers, armed with cheap mortgages, flocked to the housing market.
Roughly a third of Quebec buyers had taken out mortgages with 30-year amortizations - and that number rose to 40 per cent in Montreal, Mr. Cardinal said. He calculated that the change was the equivalent of raising interest rates by one percentage point.
Similar problems have plagued markets such as Moncton and Halifax, according to a recent housing market forecast from Re/Max. In Regina and Saskatoon, the number of unsold housing units hit a 30-year high, Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation said, the majority of them condos.
Winnipeg has also seen a surge of new condo construction since 2012 as builders rushed to cater to new immigrants under Manitoba's provincial nominee program and retirees looking to downsize and spend their winters down south.
Last year was the first time in 30 years that the city saw more multifamily units under construction than single-family homes. The level of unsold inventory has been rising, as have rental vacancy rates, sparking concerns about overbuilding.
"That's something we're keeping an eye on," said Dianne Himbeault, CMHC senior market analyst. "At this point levels are above the five-year average in terms of completed an unoccupied units."
Montreal in particular has been grappling with a glut of unsold condos for the past two years as builders haven't scaled back their plans in the wake of softening demand. The city had a backlog of nearly 3,000 unsold condos last year, yet condo starts in Montreal rose 19 per cent, defying analyst expectations for a slowdown in new construction.
There are now nearly 20 condo sellers for every one buyer in Quebec City and downtown Montreal, well above the long-term average, said Hélène Bégin, chief economist at Desjardins Group.
In Gatineau, near Ottawa, condo prices have fallen 14 per cent, as stricter rules and federal government job cuts have sapped the confidence of new buyers.
Yet despite a rising stockpile of unsold units, prices in Montreal's condo market haven't fallen, rising 1 per cent last year, in large part because developers are choosing instead of offer generous incentives instead of price breaks. "Instead of taking $10,000 or $20,000 off the price, they're offering to furnish it with the whole washer, dryer, dishwasher, stove and fridge," said Realtor Mike Abatzidis of Re/Max Du Cartier.
Desjardins' Ms. Bégin expects to see a slowdown in new construction this year if the city is to avoid a serious downturn in its condo market. "If we don't, the adjustment will be just more painful," she said.
Not everyone agrees. In downtown Montreal, a joint venture backed by Chinese investors recently broke ground on one of the city's most ambitious condo projects, a two-phase, 800-unit project known as YUL Condominiums.
"This is a world-class city which is still not seen as a condo market," said Steve Di Fruscia, CEO of Tianco Group, the Vancouverbased company developing the project with Montreal's Brivia Group. "It's just a question of time to get the local community out of the rental market and into [condos]."
So far the project is 50-per-cent sold, but Mr. Di Fruscia says he confident the city's glut of unsold condo inventory is merely the short-term growing pains of a city whose condo market is still developing.
"We are very bullish on Montreal," he said. "We think it's a great time to plant seeds. We are very hungry for some more real estate in the city."

Abstract: This isn't a new observation. A recent Gallup research report found that "texting, cellphones, and e-mail are the most commonly used modes of communication" and that this inevitably is "one of the most striking cultural and social changes in the U.S. in recent decades" that has revolutionized the way Americans communicate. For years, pundits have been warning us that this move from talk to text will alienate us all.

Full text:   My mom recently joined the 21st century. After many years of sitting on the digital sidelines, she suddenly began texting.
This may sound like no big deal. But her aversion to activities such as texting on a smartphone wasn't based on an irrational fear of technology or ill-thought-out concerns for how it affects civilized conversation.
My mom is legally blind, you see, and moving from a phone with a touch pad to a touch screen felt frustrating. So she communicated the old-fashioned way: She called people on the phone, memorizing an incredible list of numbers so she could run her real estate business. Her clam-shell mobile phone was an oddity, akin to using Morse code equipment in the Internet age.
Then, a few weeks ago, she decided to buy an iPhone after we convinced her that Siri, the built-in virtual assistant, could do most of the work for her.
Within 24 hours, she sent me her first text. I almost cried as I replied and then received confirmation that Siri read my response to her. Hundreds of texts have followed in its wake - maybe a bit too many - but it has immediately improved her productivity while ushering her into the modern era.
So when Dell came out with a new study about our evolving work force, and how employees at work talk less to each other, my gut reaction was "So what?" The statistics show that 50 per cent of employees prefer instant messaging or e-mail than to have a word with colleagues who are in close proximity. The trend is more pronounced in emerging markets, according to Dell, where two-thirds of employees admit to this behaviour.
This isn't a new observation. A recent Gallup research report found that "texting, cellphones, and e-mail are the most commonly used modes of communication" and that this inevitably is "one of the most striking cultural and social changes in the U.S. in recent decades" that has revolutionized the way Americans communicate. For years, pundits have been warning us that this move from talk to text will alienate us all. In a few short years, the transformation has been nothing short of dramatic. Phone calls now seem intrusive, even presumptuous.
While I still like to call people, I find that, as a recipient, the first few seconds feel uncomfortable.
I can't always tell who is calling or anticipate what they want.
From a workplace standpoint, doesn't it make sense then to communicate in a way that everyone now finds natural and comfortable? Maybe. Maybe not.
"All research shows that employee productivity as well as commitment to the job rise with face-to-face conversation," said Sherry Turkle, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the author of Alone Together: Why We Expect More From Technology and Less From Each Other.
Ms. Turkle asserts that the office needs to be designed for conversation and that management must demonstrate their commitment to improved communication by talking rather than always e-mailing.
"You can have an office designed for talk, yet the leaders of the organization make it clear that they are on e-mail. Design and messaging have to be in sync," she cautioned.
While in-person conversation does have a powerful impact, digital conversations, done well, have many desirable attributes.
Mitchell Kutney, the co-founder of JustChange Inc., a national network of donors who support local, community-based projects said that in-person conversations do a lot to "move the needle" on important issues, such as climate change, affordable housing and youth unemployment, but that maintaining these relationships takes a lot of time and energy. While his preferred mode of communication is speaking in person over a cup of coffee, if he can't squeeze in a meeting, he will opt for e-mail over the phone when faced with options that do not allow him to gauge the other person's facial expressions. That's because e-mail allows him to think about what he wants to say, and respond when he has time.
"People working on complex issues are always seeking more efficient and effective ways to expand their networks or deepen existing relationships, and this may have resulted in a movement away from talking, as texting and e-mail allow for [more] flexibility in managing time commitments," he said.
"I do not think the move to type or text lets us come across better necessarily, but it certainly provides a medium to better communicate more complex issues than talking on the phone sometimes does," Mr. Kutney added.
So it's time to stop beating ourselves up about the best approach to communication and do what comes naturally.
If my visually impaired mom can adopt texting as her go-to method for conveying important information, it has my vote.

Full text:   When John Waite and his wife Nicky took a cruise around the Hawaiian Islands, they contacted a fellow member of the Rolls-Royce Owners Club (RROC) who lives on Maui - and before you could say "Silver Cloud," the Waites were being whisked around this South Pacific paradise in their friend's Phantom One.
"It was wonderful," says John Waite, president of the British Columbia region of the RROC, a continent-wide organization with more than 7,000 members, headquartered in Mechanicsburg, Penn. That cross-border status makes the Rolls organization unique among car clubs.
Which leads to question number one: Does belonging to the RROC immediately establish your bona fides as a member of one of the most exclusive fraternities in the world?
"A Rolls-Royce has always cost as much as a house," says Waite, "and a new Rolls today would likely put you back half a million dollars." Being a Rolls owner is not for the economic faint of heart.
Across the country, Wayne Caverly, president of the St. Lawrence region of the RROC, disagrees.
"A lot of our members don't really have that much money," Caverly says. "But it was always their dream to own a RollsRoyce, or a Bentley, so that's what they've done in their retirement, and now spend their time driving around the countryside in it and having fun."
But Caverly's club colleague, Diana Wall, a British ex-pat, begs to differ. "Let's face it, you have to be pretty middle-class and up to own a Rolls," she says. "Just maintaining it is expensive. Most of our members have a number of automobiles and their Rolls is just the 'play car.' Most of them only drive them to club events."
Wall's Rolls saga is a metaphor for the over-the-top dimension of being a Rolls owner.
"My 1988 Silver Spur is the first car I ever bought," she says.
"And I only bought it because its former owner was Canada's greatest artist, Jean-Paul Riopelle."
Wall attended an estate auction of the artist's possessions, including a Rolls, at the Montreal Ritz where she bought it on impulse. Her grandfather had owned a car rental company in England and she grew up with the legendary marque. But now she owned one, so now what?
"I recall going to a dealership on Decarie in Montreal about some issue with the car and they advised me to contact the RROC for help," Wall says. She did, and before long, she was a member of both the international, and regional clubs. (You can't join a local RROC without being a member of the international organization.)
"I'm fairly typical," Wall says.
"You join for practical reasons - help maintaining the car - and stay for the social aspects."
The 2015 calendar of the St.
Lawrence region of the RROC is a non-stop social whirl. Among the highlights: a July 4 extravaganza at Morrisville, N.Y., where an American couple will host their Canadian Rolls confrères in an event that befits Rolls' luxe status.
"Our hostess will have eight to 10 enormous marquees spread across the estate," Wall says. "A marquee just for the Rolls and Bentleys. Another for dancing.
Another for drinks. Another to watch Independence Day fireworks. It's amazing. And costs a mint."
But Wall also leverages her Rolls for good works. Not long ago, she chauffeured her Silver Spur for a young couple who bought "A Dinner and Drive" at a charity event Wall hosted. "I even wore my Rolls-Royce chauffeur's hat," she says.
But fun and games is not the only benefit of the RROC. There is a practical side. "The mantra of Rolls-Royce has always been to find the best that anyone builds - and improve on it," Waite says. "It's the best-engineered car in the world."
Nicky Waite disputes that. "I have a love/hate relationship with these cars and the club," she says. "You can never really totally rely on them because, when they break down, it's a real fiddle-faddle."
"Rolls-Royces don't break down," counters her husband.
"They F.T.P. - fail to proceed."
That proclivity ultimately explains the true utility of a club such as the RROC. "I try to maintain my '55 Silver Wraith and my '29 Phantom One myself," Waite says. "But if I need help, I can get it from fellow club members both locally and on our superb online forum.
It's very useful."

Prairies' housing market derailed by crude's collapse

Abstract: The changing dynamic in the country's housing market mirrors the larger economic shift in an era of low oil prices and a cheap loonie. Alberta's economy now appears headed for a "mild and temporary" recession this year, said Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce economists Avery Shenfeld and Nick Exarhos, as falling crude prices threatened to shave more than 5 per cent from the province's GDP.

Full text:   Canada's housing market is undergoing a dramatic reversal of fortunes. Low crude oil prices are hammering once hot markets in Alberta and Saskatchewan which are now mired in slumping sales and falling prices, while markets outside of oil-producing regions gear up for a strong year.
Nationally, sales of existing homes fell 3 per cent in January compared with a month earlier and were 2 per cent lower than January of last year, the Canadian Real Estate Association reported. With an annualized 457,000 homes sold across Canada in January, sales have fallen below the country's 10-year average of 469,200, said Royal Bank of Canada senior economist Robert Hogue.
The overall numbers masked a growing regional divide driven by plunging oil prices and a falling loonie. Ontario and B.C. posted strong gains in January, with sales rising 5.3 per cent in Toronto and 8 per cent in Vancouver compared with a year earlier. In the Prairie provinces, however, home sales have been steadily dropping for the past three months and new listings have been on the rise in the wake of layoffs in the oil sector and forecasts that Alberta could fall into a recession this year.
Housing markets in Alberta and Saskatchewan have become gripped by "a clear sense of panic," wrote Toronto-Dominion Bank senior Canada Macro Strategist Mazen Issa in a Tuesday commentary, as "a rush of homeowners looking to obtain top dollar before their respective regional housing market nosedives on the price." Existing home sales fell 35 per cent in Calgary, 24 per cent in Saskatoon and 22 per cent in Edmonton compared with a year earlier. It represented the third straight month of falling sales in Alberta's major cities, with sales down 44 per cent in Calgary since October.
The level of unsold inventory sitting on the market in Calgary has nearly doubled in recent months, while sales have fallen 40 per cent, as homeowners grapple with the threat of layoffs, said Gary MacLean of Re/ Max Real Estate Central. While the city is used to booms and busts in its real estate market, Mr. MacLean says the swiftness of the crash in oil prices caught the market by surprise this time.
"It was like a train wreck," he said. "One morning the train is going by and the next it's off the track."
Prices have yet to fall as dramatically as home sales, although analysts largely expect prices to end the year anywhere from 10 to 16 per cent lower in Alberta. Prices rose 7.4 per cent in Edmonton and fell just 1.8 per cent in Calgary compared with a year earlier, although they were down 12 per cent in Regina.
Nationally, the average home price rose 3.1 per cent in January compared with the year before.
It was the weakest gain since May of 2013, the real estate association said.
The changing dynamic in the country's housing market mirrors the larger economic shift in an era of low oil prices and a cheap loonie. Alberta's economy now appears headed for a "mild and temporary" recession this year, said Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce economists Avery Shenfeld and Nick Exarhos, as falling crude prices threatened to shave more than 5 per cent from the province's GDP. By contrast, B.C. and Ontario will lead the country for economic growth, with expected GDP gains this year of 2.8 and 2.5 per cent.
In a remarkable turn of events, Alberta's historically low unemployment rate will likely rise above that of Ontario's in 2015, CIBC said, as oil producers continue to scale back on new spending, leading to rising layoffs. The bank predicts unemployment in Alberta will rise from 4.7 per cent to 6.8 per cent, while Ontario's job market will strengthen as the plummeting loonie boosts manufacturing exports. The province's unemployment rate is expected to fall from 7.2 per cent last year, to 6.6 this year.
In Windsor, Ont., new home sales rose more than 22 per cent compared with last January. The city had been hard hit in the past by a high dollar, but a $2-billion investment by Chrysler Group LLC in the local assembly plant amid a plunging loonie has recently boosted demand for as many as 1,800 workers, helping the region's housing market.

Will this building be sold? It's complicated: This week, the Toronto District School Board agreed to move toward selling four school sites.

Full text:   Only 10 minutes into a TDSB neighbourhood meeting this week, a hand shot up from one of the over two dozen people sitting in the library at Essex Public School. "Are we going to be talking about schools closing and declining attendance and what that is going to do to our schools?" asked a parent in the audience.
There is little else on the minds of parents these days, ever since the province announced in January that as part of its response to Margaret Wilson's report into governance issues at the TDSB, the board must present a three-year plan to reduce its underutilized space. One in five schools at the TDSB, 130 in total, fall within the threshold.
Ausma Malik, the area trustee at the Essex meeting, in Toronto's Christie Pits neighbourhood, sounded a reassuring note. Schools on the hit list - her ward has several - will not necessarily close.
Expanding or changing school boundaries and starting up high-demand programs such as French immersion could be ways to keep them open.
"Those are the kind of conversations we need to be having before we are rushed to close schools," she says.
The problem for the TDSB is that conversations, while democratic, take time. And time is exactly what the province does not have. Facing a provincial deficit of $12.5-billion, Premier Kathleen Wynne and Liz Sandals, her education minister, are looking to shave up to $500-million, or 2 per cent, from the budget for elementary and secondary high schools by 2017-2018.
Trustees - half of whom, like Ms. Malik, are newly elected - are under enormous pressure from Ms. Sandals to address surplus schools. At a meeting this week, they approved a capital plan made by the old board last June, which included recommending the sale of four non-operating school sites and identified another 16 as possible candidates for sale.
Yet past history involving battles around school redevelopments and rapidly mobilizing parents and residents suggest the chances of sales moving forward quickly are slim. The province may force the board to pick up speed. It is proposing changes to the community consultation process around school closures that many municipal officials fear would limit public engagement and make it easier to shutter schools. The changes would cut the number of public meetings required to two from four and shift the emphasis away from considering a school's value to the local community and onto the success of students.
The province argues the changes will encourage parents to think about school closures as opportunities rather than losses, and give municipalities early notice that land is coming up for sale.
"It is not the responsibility of the parents to be making planning decisions. That is a conversation that the boards and the municipalities need to have," Education Minister Liz Sandals said in an interview this week.
Parents, however, are reluctant to stick to that role. At Thursday's meeting, many talked about the importance of maintaining school properties for their green space and expanding the community services housed in the buildings. They have support from Mayor John Tory and Toronto City Council, which just last week passed a motion asking the province to review its formula for deciding when a school is underutilized and to consider the buildings' use as community hubs.
Doing nothing is not an option.
The board is facing a $3-billion backlog of repairs to many of its aging buildings.
Still, a look at some of the first properties that may hit the real estate market shows the process will not be easy.
Old Orchard Junior Public School, College and Ossington
The board has been leasing out this building, on the same site as the at-capacity Ossington/Old Orchard Junior Public School, to the West End Parents' Daycare and a Montessori school. Within a week of finding out the building was considered surplus, parents had mobilized to defend the child-care centre many rely on.
"There is a bit of a disconnect when the provincial government is saying we need to preserve daycare spaces ... I understand that every school can't stay open, but in this case it's a unique situation. It's uniquely tied to this other school that is at capacity," says Heidi Pyper, a parent on the school council.
And the parents have already put together a history of the green space on the property.
"This school and that property was transformed by the parents and the community in the eighties. They planted trees and created an actual apple orchard to honour the site that was previously an orchard," Ms. Pyper said.
Ms. Malik, the trustee responsible for the school, says she is talking to the board about how a site with a daycare on it ended up on the list. "We absolutely need to work toward a co-operative solution [on funding]," she said. But that conversation can't happen inside the "pressure cooker" of threatened school closings.
C.B. Parsons Junior High School, Dufferin and Lawrence
This building is currently leased to the private Fieldstone School, and the Toronto Lands Corp. (the school board subsidiary responsible for disposing of surplus properties) is proposing severing the site so that it retains the surrounding green space. Should development along Dufferin and Lawrence intensify, as the city plans, that land could house a new school for the children of future condo dwellers.
"I am really concerned that we are not increasing density without having a place to put the kids," said Jennifer Arp, the new trustee for Ward 8.
Concern over how the city will grow affects many of the potential sites on the long list of buildings that are currently below 65 per cent of full capacity. If development follows the city's official plan, schools located near "Avenues" such as Eglinton will see increasing demand. Some of the inner suburbs are also likely to see increases in the number of school-aged children as families repopulate aging neighbourhoods; and specialized programs, such as French immersion, can drive demand.
Hanging over the community consultations that will happen around the C.B. Parsons site is the fate of the former Bannockburn P.S., whose field was declared surplus back in 2013 in a move that is currently before the Ontario Municipal Board.
Still, Ms. Arp believes in some cases, the sales should and will proceed. "Everyone sort of understands that we might have to let the properties go. We are in the business of public education and we should be making sure the buildings that house our students are in the best shape that they can be ... and if that means that we really have to look at our budget and really consider letting some of the buildings go, we have to consider that."
Bridgeport Drive and Bridgend Street, Scarborough
There is at least one situation under which the board is likely to proceed with a sale without much opposition from the community: When the land is empty, now and forever.
Bought to serve the needs of a subdivision that turned out to have fewer school-aged children than anticipated, Bridgeport is partly a parking lot and partly where local kids play sports.
"They were anticipating years ago that they might need to put another school in there," says Jerry Chadwick, the trustee for Ward 22.
Mr. Chadwick anticipates some concerns to be raised about the loss of green space, but says a local daycare may be interested in looking at the space available.
Even so, the board will have to negotiate with the Catholic board, which co-owns the sixacre site, on how to sever its half ownership stake.
Mr. Chadwick is more concerned about advising parents on several other clusters of schools in his ward that have been identified as possible revenue generators. "I would much rather see [Bridgeport] sold than a piece of our active schools severed or something like that, because there are no children on it," Mr. Chadwick said. "It's up to the community to say 'We're good with that.' "It's a very emotional issue any time you talk about selling a school in a community."

They tore Tonito down from the wall, thrust him into a coffin, walked him down Calle Aguila to the Malecon, and tossed him into the sea. The Communists, meanwhile, seized the entire Yanqui phone company and, in the ensuring three years, confiscated $1.6-billion worth of U.S property across the island.
Almost six decades later, the United States is intent on making the Cubans pay. Literally.
Now the property of the staterun phone monopoly ETECSA, the telephone company is just one of roughly 6,000 confiscated assets, estimated to be worth a total of more than $7-billion, to which American firms and citizens hold claims. If the Cubans want the United States to lift its gruelling economic embargo - now a possibility, after U.S. President Barack Obama announced the re-establishment of diplomatic relations in December - they're going to have to address the thorny issue of compensation. With Mr. Obama's presidency winding down, and Cuba's economy suffering even more than usual thanks to the woes of petro patron Venezuela, pressure is beginning to build to tackle the elephant in the room.
Although Cubans have long considered the embargo a form of slow genocide, America clearly feels differently. In its eyes, Mr. Castro and his comrades took part in nothing less than illegal seizures of property, and should now pay for what they stole if they want to normalize trade. In fact, a two-decade-old American law dictates that there will be no normalization in trade until the claims are settled.
Compensation is a freighted emotional issue for these antagonists, whose mutual antipathy long precedes the revolution. It's not just about land or assets, communism versus capitalism.
It's about the right to claim victimhood. "Cuba's crime is not that it's communist," political scientist Rafael Hernandez told me as we sat down to talk in his Havana living room last month, the day before Assistant Secretary of State Roberta S. Jacobson made her historic visit to Cuba. "The two countries have a long way to develop a relationship that surpasses a century of mistrust."
Mr. Obama's announcement may bring an economic revolution to Cuba. Although the shortterm aims include lifting travel and financial restrictions, and even moving toward an exchange of embassies, the longterm goal is to normalize trade.
But Ms. Jacobson has said that the two sides won't broach the topic of compensation until much further down the road. For the payment issue, even the process is complicated. As previous Cold War-era attempts at land claims have proved, establishing a rate for repayment will be no small feat. For one thing, no one knows whether the United States, which represents all the claims, will seek to settle in one lump sum or want to address each case individually.
Following the provenance of some big U.S. claims involving Cuba is strictly for the org-chart nerds. The largest claim belongs to Staples, which, in a takeover, just inherited Office Max's claim for $270-million. Office Max had inherited its claim from Boise Cascade Company, the pulp-andpaper concern, which in turned had owned the rights to Cuban Electric Company, the U.S.-owned utility that once supplied 90 per cent of the island with its power.
ETECSA, meanwhile, formerly the home of little Tonito Ring Ring, is in the cross hairs of Starwood Hotels; the hospitality company bought ITT-Sheraton in 1998.
Located in central Havana, ETECSA's headquarters boasts a lobby with bronzed floor engravings, a marbleized glow, and a touch of People's Republic clunkiness: posters of Fidel and Raul Castro tacked to the walls. To the right as you enter is a dimly lit, one-room phone museum displaying some of the technology that once kept the relationship between Cuba and America ticking. As museum director Ian Chaviano walks me through the space, I spring the news on him and a much older employee, Fulgencio Hernandez, that this very building is part of a property dispute worth roughly $50-million.
Mr. Hernandez, who remembers Tonito's funeral well, scoffs at the claim. "I don't think the Americans are interested in all this," he says with a dismissive flourish of his hand. "It's all old junk."
While the property and building must be worth a fair amount, Mr. Hernandez raises a pertinent point about the phone company's technology. It's not just dated.
Much of it is probably worthless: On display is an old operator switchboard, a Morse-code machine, and a hand-crank telephone that the Democratic Republic of Germany sent to its socialist brother when the U.S. pulled up stakes.
Still, some of these things are priceless in their own way, rich narratives that speak to a familial kind of relationship that can be freighted with miscommunication, oversensitivity and obstinacy. In one display case is a section of an underwater cable, the size of a body builder's arm, that linked Havana to Key West in the 1920s, when America played overprotective big brother to its rebellious and restive smaller sibling.
Obsessed with the cable, I went back to the hotel and searched for more history. After the two countries installed their first 200-kilometre submarine cable in 1900, the two sides did a test run. The man on the end of the U.S. line called his Cuban counterpart, but heard nothing. Following a long silence, Havana finally piped up.
"Sorry," said the voice on the other end. "I don't understand you."
The issue of due diligence
Guy Chartier is a Canadian realestate developer in Havana, where he is spearheading the building of both a five-star hotel in the Cuban capital and a resort on the way from here to Varadero. The co-founder of Montrealbased company Dundee 360, he and one of his firm's lawyers, Julio A. Gonzalez Dosil, are having coffee at the Saratoga, a stateowned, high-end hotel. American accents can be heard everywhere in the dining room and the hotel bar, where guests can watch CNN. The Saratoga is where the most recent U.S. senatorial delegation, led by Patrick Leahy, is rumoured to have stayed.
Mr. Chartier explains that the majority of property in Cuba before the revolution was foreignowned. It's an implicit reminder that, going back more than a century, Cuba has relied on patron states, whether Spain, the U.S., the U.S.S.R., or, most recently, Venezuela (at least until the oil market bottomed out). Any such property could be booby-trapped with a foreign claim. "If I have one message for anyone looking at property here, it's 'Do your homework,' " says Mr. Chartier.
"The majority of projects we've looked at have claims on them."
Immediately before the revolution, though, the U.S. held the lion's share of private property in Cuba. In addition to their dominion over the phones, mining and, of course, sugar, American companies also controlled roughly 75 per cent of arable land.
Before going into any deal, Mr. Chartier explains, company lawyers must chase down the property's prerevolutionary ownership. That, in fact, is the easy part: The Cubans are serious record-keepers, and such information will be almost certainly be housed in government buildings.
Then the tedious work will begin: The company will have to track down former title holders or their relatives to ensure there are no outstanding claims that could sneak up later. (For that kind of online sleuthing, Dundee 360 can use its DSL line which, by the way, costs the company around $1,500 a month.) The process could take years, but due diligence must be done. "We don't want to be trafficking in confiscated property," says Mr. Chartier.
"Otherwise, we're putting owners and shareholders at risk for compensation claims."
When the Communists ousted Mr. Batista, the new government illegally expropriated much of the island's foreign-owned property: refineries, factories and assets that belonged to international companies ranging from Shell to the Royal Bank of Canada. They also grabbed assets that belonged to such iconic American companies as Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, and Bacardi - what has been described as the largest uncompensated seizure of U.S. property by a foreign government in history.
In 1964, the U.S. Congress established the Cuban Claims Program, which authorized the Department of Justice, through the Foreign Claims Settlement Commission, to evaluate claims, put a price tag on them, and register them.
Over the decades, the Castro regime has settled with several countries that had outstanding claims, including Canada, Spain and Britain. Often, it was in lump sums for pennies on the dollar. In 1988, the Spanish received $40million, a little more than a tenth of Spain's original asking price.
Eight years earlier, Canada had settled for $850,000. While its opening position has never been made public, one can assume it, too, received a fraction of what it wanted; Canada had been a major player in the island's financial sector. In his 2013 biography of Pierre Trudeau, author Bob Plamondon wrote that, as part of its gambit, the Cuban government offered Canada tobacco leaves and sugar.
The U.S. government, on the other hand, has held fast to its position that settling is not in the best interests of American claimants. Almost 20 years ago, during the Clinton administration, Congress passed the Helms-Burton Act. Among its many legal prohibitions, the lifting of the trade embargo against Cuba was made conditional on the settlement of property claims.
"The big battle will be the lifting of the embargo," Norway's ambassador to Cuba, John Petter Opdahl, tells me, as we sit in his sleek, Scandi-cool office in Havana. Mr. Opdahl, who has a reputation as one of Havana's more gimlet-eyed diplomats, likened the relationship to a bad divorce.
Now the two sides will have to battle over assets.
Many Cubans criticize the claimants and the claims process. To them, those companies that weren't present at the time of the revolution shouldn't be demanding payment. Moreover, some Cubans don't agree with how the valuation was done in the first place. Carlos Alzugaray Treto, a former diplomat and a professor at the University of Havana's Center of Hemispheric and United States Studies, says it's not right for the U.S. to base its valuations on the paper value of the companies at the time of the revolution. "We should base the compensation on tax returns," he tells me, as we sit one afternoon on the bustling veranda of the Hotel Nacional de Cuba. "And they want us to pay cash, but we don't have cash."
Not to be outdone by the U.S. demands, the Cubans came up with their own big ask in 1999: $100-billion in damages for economic losses and hardships suffered under the U.S. embargo. "It is genocide, purely and simply," the president of Cuba's National Assembly, Ricardo Alarcon, said at the time. While the $100-billion may seem like an unrealistically large amount to critics of the Castro regime, the Cuban experts I spoke with say that their government expects the United States to take the demand as seriously as Cuba takes the HelmsBurton Act.
Former chair of the U.S. Foreign Claims Settlement Commission, Mauricio J. Tamargo, says that, in fact, the American claims are not based on paper values; rather, Washington arrived at its final tally by looking at a combination of real-estate property taxes, comparables in sales prices at the time of the revolution, and receipts of improvements at the time of expropriation.
Now a lawyer at law firm Poblete Tamargo in Washington, the Havana-born Tamargo adds that the list of claimants isn't upto-date: Many individual claimants have passed away, and their relatives have not given notice; some corporate claimants could have gone into bankruptcy or have new owners who are unaware of any claim. "The U.S. government," he explains, "has been somewhat negligent in setting up a system for keeping the claims current."
Regardless, he insists, what has happened to property since its seizure does not affect the value of a certified claim - that is a precept of international law.
With so many variables, permutations and counterclaims, getting to actual settlements will no doubt prove enormously difficult. Some experts suggest employing the same kind of streamlined process that was used in Eastern Europe to compensate claimants whose land was also seized by communists; in many cases, property was returned to the owners, or they received remuneration.
Given Cuba's dire financial situation, corporate claimants likely will require flexibility on their positions: being open, for example to joint ventures; or being willing to take pennies on the dollar in exchange for equity. Maybe Starwood would take a chunk of ETECSA, say, and spin that equity off to an American telco. Or maybe there is a kind of barter to be had: "Coca-Cola doesn't want its dilapidated old plant," hypothesizes Michael J. Kelly, a Cuba expert and professor of international law at Nebraska's Creighton University. "It wants distributions rights. And it definitely wants to get there before Pepsi." Hopes, and fears, of change In fact, private and corporate claims may prove the easiest to settle.
On the other hand, how do you solve a problem like the Church of the Good Voyage? The five-century-old Iglesia del Santo Cristo del Buen Viaje in Old Havana takes its name from seasick and sea-weary sailors who used to find sanctuary here. Before the revolution, the Buen Viaje belonged to the Brothers of the Order of Hermits of St. Augustine.
Most of the people who ran it were from the U.S., and afterward, most of them fled. The Augustinian brothers in America now want nearly $8-million in compensation for the church's seizure and the confiscation of other properties.
Except for a few tourists, two abuelas and a man behind a bare table, the church is largely empty during my late-morning visit. I start up a conversation with Father Quirilio, the mild-mannered and blunt padre who oversees the place. We talk about the history of his religious order, which has since removed the world Hermits from its name, and the history of this particular church.
Did he realize, I ask him, that he is on expropriated property? Padre Quirilio's expression suddenly clouds over with what seems to be either dismay or disbelief. "The land was never nationalized," he says, in Spanish. "It still belongs to the church." His eyes widen further. "We're the same order, so how would we pay them back?"
Whether it is the church or the government that has to reimburse Father Quirilio's brothers in the United States, the value of the land it sits on will likely skyrocket should American tourists begin hitting Cuba's shores. Thanks in part to the modest privatization program set in motion by President Raul Castro in 2011, Old Havana is hopping with tourists buying things. The district is the cash machine for the tourist currency called the CUC, pronounced "kook." As in, Old Havana is Kook Town. A café con leche here costs a couple of CUCs, the equivalent of two or three days' wages for the average Cuban; Internet cafés charge about six CUCS an hour.
The Buen Viaje is steps away from the languorous bustle of Calle Obispo, the area's burgeoning strip of private and state enterprises. Its random mix of low-end shops (with half-filled shelves) and high-concept stores give it the motley vibe of Moscow in the early nineties. State-run cafés make you feel as if you're floating through a dusky, Buena Vista Social Club theme park; interspersed with those are whimsically designed private restaurants, such as O'Reilly 304 and El Chanchullero, serving stunningly delicious food.
Closer to the church, on Calle Bernaza, is a bar called El Patchanka. Its co-owner, Andrea Pignolo, who grew up listening to the Smiths, New Order and the Clash, plays classic alternative music and more local indie stuff, a break from the traditional tourist tunes. "There's so much more to Cuban music than what you hear down the street," says the Italian expat. Mr. Pignolo says he thinks real-estate prices are set to boom around here and the church. The plaza across from Buen Viaje is fenced off while being restored to its former glory. "This will be the most popular square in all of Old Havana," he predicts.
There are parts of Cuban life that Mr. Pignolo can do without: foraging for such basic needs as countertops; waiting in line for six hours to buy a sandwich grill, only to find out he needs a Cuban national to sign the required government documents. But he's torn over the possible changes in Havana that may come from property swaps, rampant commercialization and waves of new tourism. Like many small-business owners here, he says Cuba is not prepared for the onslaught. It has neither the physical infrastructure nor the social safety net to absorb the people who would inevitably fall between the cracks of a more capitalistic society. He worries that Cuba could end up like Brazil: too rich and too poor at once.
On one wall of his bar, in huge letters, is a slogan from Joe Strummer, the late singer of the Clash. It says, "The Future is Unwritten."
Brothers at a crossroads
A state-run restaurant and microbrewery is a rare sight in Cuba. Even more odd for a Communist tourist trap, it's popular with tourists. Overlooking Havana's harbour, this converted warehouse is teeming with visitors munching on barbecued pork, smoking cigars, and sipping on torres, or towers, of beer. Big screens play Jay Z videos. This place has the happy-hour glow of success.
The Castro government must look at this as a model of the future. No U.S. chain like TGI Fridays has put its grubby hands anywhere near it, at least not yet. Independent and bustling, it proves that small businesses can be capitalist and communist at the same time.
There are, however, a few kinks, beginning with the name of the place: The Cerveceria Antiguo Almacen de la Madera y El Tabaco, which translates as the Old Wood and Tobacco Warehouse Brewery, is a little lumbering. But there is a more profound issue lurking under the foundation: a land mine that 360 Dundee and its DSL line would have quickly sussed out. A U.S. shipping company has an $850,000 claim on this property and the entire kilometre or so of nearby waterfront.
I approach a burly, wizenedlooking type with crossed arms who looks like he's in charge. As it turns out, Noslen Camps is a security guard of some sort, but quicker to laugh than your typical bundle of muscles. We discuss the issue that people are speculating about in hotel lobbies, cabs and restaurants: what détente will bring to the island. Secretary of State Jacobson has just touched down in Havana, the highestranking U.S. diplomat to visit Cuba in 35 years, and everyone on the island, it seems, is uniformly positive about her arrival. For many, the hatred of America is old news: "I may not look it, but I'm too young to remember the conflict," the 32-year-old Mr.
Camps tells me. He is part of a Cuban generation that may know more about the most recent season finale of Homeland than about the Bay of Pigs mission.
In fact, despite a century of mutual suspicion, the two countries share a lot of the same DNA: an up-and-running 6 a.m. industriousness; a reverence of punctuality, leavened with a sly, rebellious streak; a love of beisbol - not soccer. And young adults in Cuba are obsessed with their paquetes, thumb drives with a pay-per-view range of the most recent U.S. television shows and movies, as well as books, magazines and video games.
But, as between any siblings, there is bound to be miscommunication. Both sides share another trait: stubbornness. Remember the ice-breaking handshake between presidents Castro and Obama at Nelson Mandela's funeral over a year ago? As though strangers, the leaders introduced themselves to each other even though each knew perfectly well who the other man was. They were like long-estranged brothers who nonetheless need each other. And now, they have a battle over an estate to settle.
The conventional wisdom is that the two leaders have two years to ratify a deal, the finish line being the next U.S. election when, perhaps, a less-friendly president is sworn into power.
With its flow of over 100,000 barrels of Venezuelan oil a day in jeopardy, Cuba needs a quick infusion of liquid capital from somewhere, and the faster it can normalize diplomatic relations with its estranged brother, the more CUC-spending Americans will arrive on its shores. Mr. Obama, meanwhile, needs a monumental foreign-policy victory.
Standing by the wharf in Havana, I try to imagine what the scene might look like on the eve of 2017. Except for the Cervezeria, the area appears blighted, the U.S.
shipping company's $850,000 claim generous. To my left is a rickety pier that gives up half-way into the water, where it slumps.
To my right is an indoor art exhibition where the usual suspects are being sold: paintings, Santeria dolls, maracas, Che T-shirts. At the farthest end of the wharf is a massive blown-out warehouse that looks as if it would ably shelter an eye-patched Samuel L.
Jackson in a dystopian film.
In three years, this could all be on its way to becoming one big waterfront mall, not unlike Baltimore's Inner Harbor, or something more low-key, like San Francisco's Fisherman's Wharf. Or that pier may still be around, slouching into the deep.
After some more chatting about politics, I explain the claim situation to Mr. Camps. Would he have any philosophical or political objections if the U.S. shipping company - or any U.S. company - took control of the restaurant where he works? "As long as I'm making money," he says, "I'll work for either country."

Ever since 1920, when Huntsville entrepreneur Charles Orlando Shaw opened the exclusive Bigwin Inn on Bigwin Island, the largest patch of dry land in Muskoka's Lake of Bays, investors have been dreaming up schemes to merchandise the island's reputation as a resort of the rich, titled and eminent.
One of the worst of these ideas almost became reality a couple of decades ago, I was told by Jack Wadsworth, a retired American investment banker living in San Francisco and current owner of the island's golf club. That was when local planning authorities okayed a previous landlord's bid to lay out the golf course, and - this was the bad part - to put up a 150-room hotel on undeveloped land near the links.
"All that was very interesting," Mr. Wadsworth said, "but it was totally impractical, and would not be consistent with the ambience that Bigwin is - a family community that has to be accommodated by the amenities on the island."
Mr. Wadsworth had another notion about developing his property. He decided to build upwards of 50 cottages on the parcel that had been zoned to permit a hotel. These places would be intended principally for use as guest houses or overnight lodgings for golf club members with residences nearby.
Dave Smith, who manages Mr. Wadsworth's real-estate interests on the island, estimates the cottages will go on the market for between $500,000 and $800,000 each.
The story of this development might end here, had the owner done the usual thing - simply hired the cheapest cottage-country architect around to draw off plans, contracted with anybody who can handle a hammer to do the construction, then waited for well-heeled buyers to snap up pricey, but creatively undistinguished, bits of Bigwin Island history.
But he didn't do the usual thing. Instead, he launched a design competition among six imaginative Canadian architectural firms. The list of six ("winnowed down from some 30 candidates, all Canadians, by the owner and by American architect Robert Christian Schmitt, who supervised the contest): MacKayLyons Sweetapple ("with David Bowick) of Halifax; Montreal's MU; Vancouver-based Patkau Architects; and Altius, Superkul and Taylor_Smyth, all from Toronto.
Nor did Mr. Wadsworth give the invited offices an easy assignment. Each entry, he said, was expected to embody "sensitivity to the Muskoka aesthetic and to the tradition and history of Bigwin and all of the cultural, architectural, aesthetic aspects that Bigwin is about, award-winning design, net zero [energy efficiency] to the extent feasible, and practical construction techniques employing the most modern prefabricated systems available."
Last month, the Bigwin Island Golf Club named the winning proposition, by Brian MacKayLyons, with Jennifer Esposito, of MacKay-Lyons Sweetapple, and made public the six contestants' digital presentations. ("Earlier this week, the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada named Mr. MacKay-Lyons winner of its 2015 Gold Medal, the professional body's highest award for excellence.)
If these proposals prove one thing, it's that a serious, wellmanaged competition can get memorable results. Hard choices were set before the jury, which included Mr. Wadsworth, Chris Schmitt, and Dave Smith, who will co-ordinate the work. The group had the challenging job of judging submissions that, in every instance, incorporated thoughtful, inventive responses to the culture and natural beauty of the lakeside site, and that featured considerable design savvy.
In giving the nod to MacKayLyons Sweetapple, the jury opted for a plan that combines trim artistic and physical simplicity with easy, efficient build-ability.
It offers an uncomplicated, readily legible interpretation of the shape and sense of the traditional Muskoka cottage. While the exteriors are retiring - they express perhaps too literally their rational, modular style of construction - the interiors are sensuously dramatic, airy, and gracious. The jurors, if legacyminded, will probably not be sorry they awarded the commission as they did.
But had the jury been inclined to hand out an honourable mention, it couldn't have gone to a competitor more deserving ("or more subversive) than MU. With mischief rarely witnessed among senior architects in public, this emerging Montreal practice decided to address Mr. Wadsworth's primary requirement - that the designers honour the "Muskoka aesthetic" - by generating a vision, not of the cabin common in the area, but of the wigwam that native Canadians in this part of the world presumably lived in long ago.
("I'm not sure they did. The tepee that illustrates MU's program looks to me like an aboriginal dwelling from the great plains, not the eastern woodlands. But never mind.)
The results of the firm's playful thinking about the source they've hit upon, if renderings can be believed, would be boldly strange, yet curiously beautiful and peaceful, and quietly at home in their forest or meadow settings.
While members of the golf club, I suspect, would not tolerate this sort of intervention for a minute, I'm glad MU got a chance to make their case for something odd and wonderful.
But you may not need to take my word on MU, or anything else. If Mr. Wadsworth and his team get their wish, the outcomes of this contest will be exhibited in Toronto, and far beyond.
I hope a show of this kind happens, so that architecturally interested Canadians can decide for themselves whether this small, mindful competition really conjured up some pretty interesting suggestions for 21st-century cottages, as I believe it did.

The high cost of low oil: Signs of suffering include job losses in the oil patch and significant cuts in government spending

Full text:   The collapse in global crude prices is exacting a heavy toll on Canada's oil patch and governments, with industry layoffs now mounting into the thousands and public spending getting slashed.
A series of deep cuts in the energy sector on Thursday, from drillers to oil sands developers, shows the severity of economic strains caused by the halving of oil prices since June.
Precision Drilling Corp., the country's largest contract driller, and Cenovus Energy Inc., one of the top oil sands developers, said they were handing as many as 2,000 workers their notices, adding to numerous layoffs by other companies in recent weeks.
The tough moves follow industry reports this week projecting oil's downturn is likely to persist and could see crude sink below $40 ("U.S.) per barrel. U.S. benchmark oil rose $2.37 to $51.21 a barrel on Thursday, down from more than $100 seven months ago.
Precision said it is operating 200 drilling rigs, down from 250 a year ago. Each one employs 20 to 25 people, spelling a job reduction of at least 1,000.
"Precision recruited, trained and developed many excellent crews to support the demands of our customers over the past several years, and unfortunately we now don't have work for many of these dedicated workers," CEO Kevin Neveu said.
The impacts are spreading across the economy, which the government of Prime Minister Stephen Harper has held up as being a huge beneficiary of energy-sector expansion. Alberta and other provinces reaped major financial rewards as the industry plowed tens of billions of dollars into operations and hired armies of workers as oil boomed.
Now, everything from employment to local real estate markets are starting to suffer. In a report Thursday, Toronto-Dominion Bank predicted real estate market corrections in Calgary, Edmonton and cities in Newfoundland, pointing out a severe slump in Alberta home sales in January.
The downturn is also complicating Ottawa's finances as the federal government prepares a pre-election budget to be released no earlier than April. Indeed, the price collapse prompted the government to delay its 2015 budget.
Finance Minister Joe Oliver's Nov. 12 economic update projected a $1.9-billion ("Canadian) surplus for the coming year based on an assumption of $81 ("U.S.) oil.
Since then, the Bank of Canada has opted to use $55 oil for its forecasts, and earlier economic projections of a significant rebound in prices this year have evaporated in recent weeks. It cited the downdraft in energy as part of the reason it cut interest rates last month.
"I believe that we are in for much greater volatility in oil prices for the foreseeable future.
That's why you've seen Cenovus preserve cash by moderating our growth and reducing our work force," chief executive Brian Ferguson told analysts and reporters.
Other oil-industry players are preparing for austerity. Husky Energy Inc. chopped $400-million ("Canadian) from its 2015 budget.
France's Total SA, which spent much of the past decade acquiring Alberta oil sands assets, wrote down the value of the holdings by $2.2-billion ("U.S.) because of the weak prices.
The harsh medicine in the industry came a day after Premier Jim Prentice warned Albertans that dwindling energy-sector activity will cut his government's revenue by as much as $7-billion ("Canadian), and force a 9-percent reduction in public spending.
Unlike Alberta, which collects energy royalties, the impact on federal finances is mainly through lower economic growth, which leads to lower personal and corporate income-tax revenue.
Many private-sector economists and the Parliamentary Budget Officer say Ottawa is on track for a deficit in 2015-16, but could turn that into a surplus by using contingency funds and making internal spending adjustments. Mr. Harper has insisted the government will return to surplus in spite of low oil prices.
Some economists question whether restraining spending to meet a political target of returning to surplus is the right response to the current economic problems.
"If anything, they perhaps should be running a deficit for longer because the economy's going to need that support," said David Madani, Canada economist for Capital Economics. "Now is not the time to be thinking about austerity."

What is a typical downtown Toronto house? If you've lived in this city for more than five minutes, you know the answer.
It's elderly, and it's brick. It stands three storeys tall. On the second level (or sometimes on the first), a glazed paunch or bay window opens toward the sidewalk. Its roof is pitched in line with the fashion current at the time of construction: steeply and narrowly if the house was put up when Gothic was in vogue, broadly and capaciously if it was topped off in the Edwardian era, and so on.
It has a porch and a small garden out front - modest but significant symbolic intervals between domestic space and the street. Neither frivolous nor mean, the house-type commonly encountered in Hogtown districts developed before 1945 speaks of sturdy, industrious values, common sense and respectability.
It's free of postmodernist affectations such as eccentricity and neurosis and wit - though, to tell the truth, it's probably a little short on warmth and charm.
Never mind: This legacy from yesteryear's developers has proven to be physically durable and enduringly popular, and we should thank them for it. Not that it's entirely a thing of the past, a phenomenon without consequences for the present. Indeed, local designers of contemporary dwellings meant for traditional downtown streets often riff on the features of the type, updating them (with varying degrees of flair) to appeal to 21st-century urban tastes and sensibilities.
If you would like to see an interesting residential example of the updating I'm talking about, drop by 312 Gladstone Ave. The new, 2,350-square-foot residence at that address, on the market for $1.9-million, is the handiwork of Toronto architect Steven Fong and developer/builder David Yostos (of Y Squared), who told me that it represents "an American interpretation of the Toronto house." (Both Mr. Fong and Mr. Yostos are from the United States.)
Of course, "American" can mean many things. But on the evidence of what these Yanks have done here, the term recalls attractive modern architectural traditions that are open-handed and democratic, at home with strong, plain materials, and immune to show-off.
Take, for example, the streetside façade. A short, practical flight of concrete steps leads up from the small forward garden to a small porch projecting from a brick Toronto-style face. The second level, which bulges out toward the street in a way reminiscent of a Victorian bay window, is trimmed with light-tinted precast concrete panels, while the glazing on the uppermost storey is framed by dark vertical steel slats. This three-part composition is muscular, but not pushy. Its tall, slender form calls to mind the profiles of old Toronto houses on Gladstone and numerous other avenues, while its material palette is modern and industrial-strength.
In fact, the architect and builder have deliberately sought to give their version of the typical Toronto house a hard-hat touch.
Small plants, workshops, warehouses and such, after all, are scattered throughout the city's older neighbourhoods, especially on the west side of downtown.
While many of these establishments have recently undergone conversion into condo stacks, their exteriors still lend bluecollar accents to gentrified streetscapes. There's a chocolate factory right across Gladstone from 312. Mr. Fong and Mr. Yostos did a good deed when they decided to let their house's otherwise genteel façade make a bow, at least in terms of its tough materiality, to the industrial emplacements round about.
But if the exterior of this house looks back over its shoulder to sources and styles from the past, its interior - unlike the intensely divvied-up living space in the traditional Toronto house - is loft-like, uncluttered and pillar-free. The structure has been steel-framed to insure both physical solidity and maximum openness in the layout.
As you might expect in a project tailored for casual contemporary living, the entry level is a clear spatial sweep from the front door and dining area, through the kitchen, to the living-room ensemble at the rear, and beyond it. When the transparent back wall is completely folded away, that is, the interior (which has engineered whiteoak flooring) will be joined almost seamlessly to the ample deck, doubling the size of the living room in clement weather.
The three bedrooms and study are on the second and topmost levels, and there is a basement suite, accessible through a entrance separate from the main one. While such arrangements are in keeping with conventional market wisdom, Mr. Fong and Mr. Yostos have introduced elements throughout their scheme that are unconventionally lovely. The handsome staircase, for instance, features steel treads that seem to float effortlessly between the wall and the glass bannister; and the master bathroom has the suavity and spaciousness of one in an upmarket, chic hotel. (When not busy with houses, Mr. Fong designs boutique hotels and clubs.)
This house just north of Little Portugal succeeds architecturally, then, in both its intentions: to carve out of the city an efficient, sensuously engaging space for modern living; and to respond in thoughtful ways to its venerable precedent, the "typical Toronto house."

For the mayor of austerity-stricken Athens, 'every day is a new battle'

Full text:   C ar bombs, mass strikes, violent protests, grinding poverty, soaring unemployment, neo-Nazi street gangs, drug addicts. In any given day, Giorgos (George) Kaminis, the American-born mayor of Athens, can face any of those horrors, sometimes several of them at once.
The Greek capital, now Europe's ground zero for the anti-austerity movement after the election of the radical left Syriza party, might win the award for the European Union city you would least like to govern.
Athens has seen virtually no investment since the start of the financial crisis in 2008 and desperately needs an overhaul.
Government buildings and parks suffer from neglect. Some of the buildings damaged or even destroyed in the anti-austerity riots of 2011 and 2012 have yet to be repaired. In the centre, the streets are dirty and graffiti is ubiquitous.
"It's a big challenge every day," Mr. Kaminis says of the pressure chamber of municipal politics in a city starved for cash. "I remember Scarlett O'Hara. Her last words in Gone with the Wind were, 'Tomorrow is another day.' For me, every day is a new battle."
Mr. Kaminis hopes the Syriza election will mark a political turning point for his beleaguered city. But his optimism may be premature. Greece wants the European Union and the European Central Bank to reduce its crushing debt load and dilute the austerity programs that insist on spending cuts and tax hikes. But a meeting on Thursday in Berlin between new Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis and his powerful German counterpart, Wolfgang Schaeuble, produced no joy for Greece. "We agreed to disagree," Mr. Schaeuble told the media.
What Mr. Kaminis wants most is taxation power - he has almost none, which accounts for the city being a perennial beggar at the doorstep of a state government that itself exists on bailout loans.
Even the real estate tax goes to the state. "The powers of mayors in Greece are in reality very few," he says. "We do not have financial autonomy, just the right to impose a very small local tax. We want the real estate tax to come directly to us."
He also wants a signal from the new government that it will embrace private investment. "If we go back to the model of a state-driven economy, Greece will be done for," he says. "It scares away investment, it creates bureaucracy and invites corruption."
Mr. Kaminis is speaking from offices that belie the country's economic woes. The town hall is a handsome, three-storey building that looks like a small palace.
The mayor is a small man and seems lost in his vast and elegant office, whose walls are covered in oil paintings that depict ruins from Greece's classic era.
He has been mayor of Athens since late 2010, the year when the effectively bankrupt country received its first bailout and plunged into a deep recession. No Greek city suffered more than Athens, which bore the brunt of cuts that turned government offices into echo chambers and gutted municipal budgets and social services. Athens even lost its city police force - it now relies on state police.
The mayor says the problem was made worse by the peculiar nature of Athens's funding, which is calculated on its official population, not the number of people who actually use its services. "For a city like Athens, a prorata budget based on population is a disaster," he says. "Why?
Because we have many, many more people than our official population who use our infrastructure - commuters, transients, refugees, tourists, undocumented migrants, commuters."
The low points of his time in office were particularly gruesome. On one night in February, 2012, a mass rally turned into a street war that saw gangs of youths and police armed like gladiators fight pitched battles throughout the centre. Some 40 buildings were set ablaze, lighting up the city as if it had been hit by bombs.
A couple of months later, the 60-year-old Mr. Kaminis narrowly escaped a mauling by a member of the neo-Nazi Golden Dawn party, whose elected leaders sit in prison awaiting trial on charges that they run a criminal organization. Golden Dawn members were distributing free food in front of the Greek parliament building. The mayor considered the distribution illegal and racist, because any poor person who was obviously not at native Greek was excluded.
"I called the police," Mr. Kaminis says. "Immediately afterward, a Golden Dawn member - he was a heavy-metal singer and a party deputy - tried to hit me."
You would think that Mr. Kaminis would be wreck of a man after running the Athens gauntlet for more than four years. But he seems entirely unfazed by the ordeal. He is soft-spoken and professorial in nature; in fact, he spent much of his early years holed up in universities and academic institutions across Europe, studying constitutional law, including the Constitution of Canada (parts of which he pronounces "magnificent"). He still looks like a rumpled professor. Like Greece's new prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, he rarely sports a necktie.
Mr. Kaminis is part of an apparent political trend in big European cities - the anti-politician as mayor - as more voters take the view that career politicians come laden with too many vested interests.
"Kaminis is one of the few, welleducated, promising academics who entered Greek politics during the crisis," says George Tzogopoulos, a political scientist at the Hellenic Foundation for European and Foreign Policy.
Mr. Kaminis is certainly an eccentric by Greek standards. He is son of a Greek sea captain who worked in the New York office of shipping tycoon Stavros Livanos, the father-in-law of Aristotle Onassis, who would later marry Jackie Kennedy.
He was born in Brooklyn and spent his first five years there. His heavily accented English is close to fluent even though he has not lived in the United States since then.
About 15 years ago, he returned to New York for the first time since he was a little boy and got a pleasant shock at a pizzeria near his old neighbourhood. "I ordered my pizza and looked at the old black-and-white photos on the wall and I found my parents," he said. "It was a photo from a Greek celebration."
After nearly two decades in academia, Mr. Kaminis decided to indulge his passion for human rights and became Greece's deputy ombudsman for human rights.
He was promoted to ombudsman in 2003, a position he held until his election as mayor.
While he is optimistic that the worst of the economic downturn is over - and that Syriza will make the Greek economy competitive enough to attract investment - he, of course, is afraid it will all blow up if Syriza loses the fight with the EU and the European Central Bank for a new debt and austerity deal.
If Syriza fails, watch out, he says, because the dreaded Golden Dawn, which won 6.3 per cent of the vote in January's snap election, could surge in popularity.
"This government represents the left alternative and if we see it failing, then we will see the extreme right wing alternative - those fascists - gaining ground," he says. "That's why it's so important that this government doesn't fail."

Tory wants a say in sale of TDSB schools: As school board considers selling surplus real estate, mayor says city should have a voice in any decision

Full text:   Mayor John Tory wants the city to be "meaningfully consulted" before any decisions are made about the sale of surplus schools by the Toronto District School Board.
In a two-page letter sent to board chair Shaun Chen on Monday, Mr. Tory is critical of what he describes as a "polarized" debate over the fate of Toronto schools, although he is careful not to lay blame.
"I am not sure the way it appears to be unfolding is leading to either a fully informed conversation or a good decision-making environment," reads a draft of the letter obtained by The Globe and Mail.
Mr. Tory says opinion appears to be split between those that never want a school sold, and those that want every property sold that does not meet provincial enrolment numbers. The most productive way forward "lies somewhere in between," he writes.
The mayor's letter comes as the school board faces a provincially imposed deadline of Feb. 13 to say how it plans to reduce its underused space - defined as schools where students occupy 65 per cent or less of capacity. One in five TDSB schools fall within the threshold, says a report released last week by the Toronto board.
While the city has no formal say in the future of Toronto schools, Mr. Tory argues it should be involved in discussions because what happens to the properties will have a significant effect on the city, its services and its residents.
The letter also notes that under current rules the city must pay market price for any lands it might wish to keep as green space, even though those lands "are already in public ownership and paid for by the same taxpayers."
A subsidiary of the Toronto board, Toronto Lands Corp. is responsible for dealing with "surplus" properties.
Under provincial regulations, Toronto Lands follows a two-step process to lease or sell a property, first offering it to other publicsector organizations, which have 90 days to submit a bid, and then selling it on the open market if there are no takers among other school boards, postsecondary institutions or municipal, provincial or federal governments.
Between 2008 and 2014, Toronto Lands generated $405-million from property sales.
Toronto Councillor Josh Matlow, a former school board trustee, said the city does not have money sitting at the ready to buy property when it is made available by the board.
Mr. Matlow has been pushing in recent years for a forum that would bring trustees from all boards in the city and councillors together.
City council next week will vote on the latest effort, a proposal to invite all four Toronto-area boards to take part in an advisory committee to discuss common issues. As proposed by the city, the group would include six councillors and two trustees each from the TDSB and the Toronto Catholic District School Board as well as one trustee from each of the French boards.
In his letter to the TDSB chair, Mr. Tory does not discuss what form he would like consultations to take, stating only that he hopes the province and the TDSB "might identify ways in which we could be meaningfully consulted before these important decisions are finalized."
The letter lists several reasons enrolment numbers alone should not be used to decide the fate of local schools. Included in that list is the use of schools for other purposes, such as child-care centres and recreation facilities.
Toronto residents must wonder, he writes, why the city and the school boards don't share resources more, including real estate.
"I would hope that in trying to secure a quick resolution we don't achieve it at the expense of considering all the implications," his letter states.

Full text:   When Alyssa Berenstein and her husband bought their home on Haddington Avenue in North Toronto in 1999, part of the appeal was the sprawling playing field just half a block away.
The field surrounding the former Bannockburn Public School is where the couple taught their seven-year-old twins and 11-year-old son to ride a bike and ski down the little slope.
"It's a safe environment where I feel I can have my kids go," Ms. Berenstein said. "I'm not concerned about the ball rolling down to the road.
There's always people in the community looking out for each other."
To the chagrin of the neighbourhood, the school board put the two-acre field up for sale in 2013. The fate of the field - one of the rare open green spaces in a neighbourhood where bungalows are rapidly being torn down and replaced with larger houses - is at the centre of a pitted battle among the Toronto District School Board, the City of Toronto and local residents.
Facing enormous pressure to raise money for capital projects, Canada's largest school board has few options but to turn to selling property to plug a $3-billion backlog of needed repairs. This week, the school board released a list of "underutilized" schools - the one in five that are operating at less than two-thirds capacity - that now face possible closure.
But selling property is far from easy. While the former Bannockburn Public School itself is not on the chopping block as the board will need it in coming years to house students - it is currently leased to a Montessori school - the flap over the sale of its land shows that these TDSB properties are more than just schools to their neighbours.
Valuable green space and walkability are at stake as the board is coming under pressure from the province to sell surplus properties due to declining enrolment.
The Bannockburn case shows how the process can get bogged down by competing interests.
Ms. Berenstein is part of a community group fighting against a decision from the school board to sell the field. Her group fears the highly valuable land will be snapped up by a property developer and wants it preserved as green space. Education Minister Liz Sandals, meanwhile, has given the school board until Feb. 13 to say how it plans to deal with underutilized schools.
Daryl Sage, chief executive of Toronto Lands Corp., a school board subsidiary responsible for selling surplus property, acknowledged that the process often puts the board on a collision course with the city.
The school board needs to maximize its return to raise money for capital projects, so it can't afford to sell the property at a discount to the city, Mr. Sage said.
And the city has a mandate to preserve parkland. "The city is saying, 'we only have so much money,' so we oppose each other that way."
Bannockburn sits on five acres of prime real estate in an affluent neighbourhood near Avenue Road and Lawrence.
The red-brick school was built in 1924 and housed 325 students, but closed in 1981 due to declining enrolment. Former city councillor Karen Stintz said this was due in part to an aging population, as well as a high concentration of Jewish residents in the area, many of whom send their children to independent Hebrew schools.
The Bannockburn field is one of 25 properties the school board has declared as surplus. With many of the properties, the school remains a core holding and land attached to it is put on the block.
After the school board put Bannockburn's two-acre field up for sale, community residents rallied against the decision, gathering more than 700 signatures in favour of having the land remain as park space.
The French School Board and Toronto Catholic School Board both expressed an interest in buying the land, but a deal was never reached. Angelo Sangiorgio, an associate director at the Catholic board, said Toronto Lands never responded to its expression of interest in purchasing either the entire site or just the two acres.
Ms. Stintz moved a motion last November not only to purchase the two acres of land, but also to urge the province to ensure that parks attached to schools are preserved as green space.
Councillors approved the motion, but the city missed a 90day deadline set by Toronto Lands to submit a formal bid, and is now in discussions with the school board to purchase a small portion of the property.
"If it gets sold off to build a couple of town home [developments]," Ms. Stintz said, "that would be so tragic."
Ms. Stintz's motion also asked city staff to meet with the TDSB to ensure parklands attached to schools in park-deficient areas not be sold.
After the city's committee of adjustments denied the board's request to sever the land, the case was sent to the Ontario Municipal Board. The case will be back before the OMB in May.
Meanwhile, the area's population is expected to shift again.
Christin Carmichael Greb, the area's current councillor, said there are applications at the city for multiple condo towers around the area, including along Avenue Road and Wilson Avenue. The neighbourhood's many bungalows are increasingly being torn down and rebuilt as larger homes for families moving into the area.
"People are wanting to raise their kids in the area, and part of that is having a space for their kids to run around in," she said.
Jennifer Arp, newly elected trustee for the area, is pushing for the school board to reconsider the sale of the field. She said the board needs to work closer with the city to protect green space.
"Finances are tight for every level of government, so how do we work together and build better relationships so we are able to protect our public assets?" Trish McMahon is the organizer behind the Save Bannockburn Park group. She lives near Lawrence and Mount Pleasant, and her two kids, ages five and 7, both go to the Montessori school at Bannockburn. During the warmer months, her kids play on the field after school about three days a week. Her older son also uses the field to play T-ball through the Armour Heights baseball league.
Ms. McMahon estimates that through the course of the school year and the summer, about 600 local kids in the neighbourhood use the field.
"This is a community hub," she said. "It's not just for soccer and baseball. You've got families having picnics there over the weekend. You've got families teaching their kids to ride a bike. You've got kids flying kites because there's no overhead wires.
They're learning to throw a football. All sorts of things you do in a big, flat, open space."
She described the local residents as a "tight-knit group" who run community sports leagues out of the field in the summer, who throw "impromptu fireworks parties" on special occasions for the kids.
If the green space is sold off and redeveloped, she said, local residents would have to get into their cars in order to get to the nextclosest playing field. And even if the kids could find their way there, she said many of those are already at capacity.
"Our concern is that we've got all these kids who would like a place to play," she said. "We worry about childhood obesity, we've got all sorts of safety [concerns] about where kids are playing - if it's sold for development, and that looks like what's going to happen - these kids have nowhere else to play."
Ms. McMahon acknowledged that demographic changes have led to the current situation, but said those same fluctuations should cause the board to think twice about selling off land.
"Bannockburn was closed because of an aging population.
... What's happened is the character of the neighbourhood is changing," she said. "With the changing demographics, they simply don't know what's going to happen with the school-aged population - a lot of those infill houses are being bought by families with kids or who are going to have kids."
Ms. McMahon, a lawyer who is studying for her doctorate in law, has devoted hundreds of hours to fighting the school board's decision, and said that most residents in a similar situation would not have the time or resources she has. "For the average Torontonian, it's a mess," she said.
But the overarching message from the province is that the school board has no choice but to raise the capital to repair aging schools.
"The board has stated that its renewal backlog is $3-billion, and that it does not have the funding to address it," said Margaret Wilson, the education consultant appointed by the Ontario government to investigate problems at the board. "The roof repair bill alone is over $200-million."

LISTING AGENT Suzanne Manvell, Royal LePage Real Estate Services Ltd.
The Action : The insulbrick siding, oil tank and aged state of this two-storey Victorian in Brockton Village scared off many buyers, but one visitor used these drawbacks as a negotiating tool to reduce the price and acquire a piece of prime real estate across from popular Mary McCormick Park and Recreation Centre.
What They Got : This more-thancentury-old home with three bedrooms and one bathroom sits on a 17-by-122-foot lot. A standard layout has entertaining, dining and cooking provided for on the main floor, including a family room, in addition to an unfinished basement and fenced backyard with access to a laneway.
The Agent's Take : "It's right across from a park, and it's not often you get that, and this particular park, the community is very active and involved in," says agent and local resident, Suzanne Manvell.
While most homes are attached to another property, this one was not. "The size is pretty typical, but what is unusual is that it's detached," Ms. Manvell notes.
"There aren't many detached in the neighbourhood or downtown Toronto in that price bracket."

Mike Kopecky comes by his love of mid-century modern architecture honestly.
With a father in the U.S. Air Force, young Mike spent the 1960s in military housing and admits that the "small, very stylish" Capehart homes "imprinted" on him at an early age.
"I did not understand it at the time, but I loved our house and I loved the way it was put together and the size. And mom will tell you the fit I pitched when we moved off base," the Austin, Tex., resident says in a phone interview.
So, after his three-decade career in the Air Force ended, the 51year-old approached his father, who had been buying and selling land since his retirement decades before, to discuss a 5.7-acre parcel in Leander, Tex., a bedroom community north of Austin.
Although the younger Mr. Kopecky had dabbled a little in real estate also - a few house-flips and one from-scratch build with his wife - he had an idea: situated just four kilometres from a lightrail stop that whisks commuters downtown in an hour or less, Mr. Kopecky realized that a small subdivision here would appeal to young, hip professionals looking for affordable homes that weren't the standard "real estate beige," as he puts it.
"It all kind of looks the same," he says of typical new homes in the region. "Nobody loves it, nobody hates it, and I said: 'We need to stand out from the rest of the crowd,' because Austin is going through an incredible building boom right now."
Given the growing interest in retro-Modern architecture, it's a development Toronto builders may want to take note of.
Mr. Kopecky had witnessed copies of mid-century magazine Atomic Ranch fly off the shelves at his local bookstore, and he'd heard of renewed interest in Austin's Crestview neighbourhood, where 1,200-square-foot, postwar fixer-uppers were going for $350,000 (U.S.).
So, he was confident that applying 1950s' styles to a development of 30 homes - christened Starlight Village - would result in folks snapping them up like so many Chevrolet Bel Airs.
His biggest hurdle, however, was persuading Leander City Council. The city requirement that dwellings contain 85 per cent masonry, for instance, would never fly, as true MCM homes require expansive, floor-to-ceiling windows and a mix of cladding materials, such as wood siding or cement board. Special permission would be required to feature carports rather than enclosed garages, and, perhaps most importantly, to offer smallerthan-average floor plans (most homes in Starlight Village will be 1,300 sq. ft., with a few smaller and a few larger) as well.
"I was expecting a lot of resistance," Mr. Kopecky says, "but what I got was seven smiles ... because most of [the councillors] had grown up in these houses."
Approval was granted on Dec. 4, 2014, and architect Sean Eubanks of Woodhill Studios of Millican, Tex., was brought on board.
While paying homage to the iconic shapes Mr. Kopecky had admired in Atomic Ranch as well as a book on the Case Study House Program - "They thought nothing of being a three [bedroom], one [bath] back then," he says - the designs will bring the houses firmly into the 21st century. Currently being finalized are floor plans featuring at least two bathrooms (even in the smallest model), nine-foot ceilings, and big fireplaces so homeowners won't "feel out of place" if they don't have Mad Men-style furniture, while exteriors sporting skinny strips of clerestory windows, stonework, and post-and-beam rooflines will be as familiar as June Cleaver's smile.
While Mr. Kopecky is still sourcing some MCM-appropriate materials, such as slim-framed windows, T-111 siding, and Roman brick, he stresses: "I'm not trying to make anybody a museum here, I'm trying to be as true as I can to the style but using modern, 21stcentury materials."
And to make the development more attractive to busy professionals, each detached home will take the legal form of a condominium, so that homeowners can leave "for a day or six months [and] still come home to a perfectly maintained unit and grounds."
If this all sounds vaguely familiar to regular readers of this space, I'll remind you of column I wrote in February, 2005: "Why aren't small, stylish houses being built?" In it, I challenged local GTA builders to take inspiration from some 1950s and 60s Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corp. illustrations and build a development of 50 to 100 homes featuring floor plans in the 1,200-to-1,700-sq.-ft. range. I argued that, if marketed properly like the then-new, very retro Mini Cooper, they'd sell like hotcakes.
While Minis have sold like hotcakes in the decade since, sadly no builder has come forward.
Perhaps, like with many things in Canada, it will take Mr. Kopecky's successful American idea - and it will be successful, with homes starting at less than $200,000 - to embolden a Toronto builder. After all, not everyone's idea of a starter home is a downtown high-rise, and the MCM craze is still going strong.
"One of the things I wanted to capture is the optimism of that period," Mr. Kopecky says. "They didn't do ironic: It's the 1950s, we're going to build rocket ships to the moon; no one's ever done that.
"I think that is what really attracts people to this period."

Price of buying a burial plot is becoming prohibitively high

Author: Giovannetti, Justin

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/price-buying-burial-plot-is-becoming/docview/1648469996/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "People are scattering remains on Grouse Mountain, in parks and on hiking trials. I don't want our public grounds becoming graveyards. We have cemeteries for that," said Peter Nobes, the Vancouver director of Catholic cemeteries. "We don't scatter body parts, why should we scatter cremated remains? It's still the human body, just in a different form."

Full text:   Record property prices in Vancouver are breaking the bank in life and in death, leading some in the Lower Mainland to favour the most inexpensive way of disposing of remains: a quick gaze over the shoulder before scattering ashes in a scenic and secluded area.
With more than 80 per cent of residents opting for cremation and with the cheapest burial plot in the Lower Mainland's Catholic cemeteries selling for more than $3,000, the local archdiocese is warning against the public scattering of remains. Church teachings forbid the practice and B.C. law requires permission from landowners before ashes are scattered.
"People are scattering remains on Grouse Mountain, in parks and on hiking trials. I don't want our public grounds becoming graveyards. We have cemeteries for that," said Peter Nobes, the Vancouver director of Catholic cemeteries. "We don't scatter body parts, why should we scatter cremated remains? It's still the human body, just in a different form."
Most cities don't keep statistics on requests to spread ashes on public land.
A parks official in Vancouver said park crews would "look the other way out of respect" if they came across someone scattering ashes.
In the picturesque City of North Vancouver, home to many popular hiking trails, crews do encounter ashes, says property services co-ordinator Ian Steward. Based on the volume, Mr. Steward suspects most of the ashes are from family pets.
Once taboo, cremation is now embraced in the Catholic Church. The practice was banned until 1963, when the prohibition was lifted with the reforms of the Second Vatican Council. The church maintains, however, that out of reverence for the body it should be interred as a whole rather than scattered.
Worried that the spreading of ashes has been "romanticized by Hollywood," Mr. Nobes says church policy is clear: Urns should be interred, whether in a cemetery, a columbarium or a niche wall.
"It anchors the person's death and gives them a permanent place," he said, cautioning against keeping urns in private homes.
But real estate in the Lower Mainland for anything - including burials for bodies or for urns - can be out of reach for some.
Mr. Nobes noted high land values are driving families to do things they never thought they would.
Sharla MacKay, president of the B.C. Funeral Association, noted that while cemetery plots in the Kootenay Region can go for about $350, a plot in the Gardens of Gethsemani cemetery in southern Surrey, the Catholic archdiocese's most active cemetery, ranges from $3,000 to $30,000.
A plot in the Mountain View Cemetery, a massive municipal burial ground operated by the City of Vancouver, costs $22,500.
That accommodates two caskets and eight urns of ashes, and the plot is the only option the cemetery sells.
Single plots in Toronto's Mount Pleasant Cemetery max out at nearly $18,000.
With more than one million bodies interred on the slopes overlooking Montreal, Canada's largest cemetery has perhaps the most radical solution to overcrowding and high property costs: Plots at the Notre-Damedes-Neiges Cemetery are only available on 99-year renewable leases.
For those who don't want or can't afford a plot, some cemeteries have begun to offer gardens where remains can be scattered among flowers. Small plaques are left behind to mark the person's identity.
Mr. Nobes urged people tempted to scatter a loved one's ashes outside of such a setting to consider the consequences. Loved ones can be left feeling empty when there is no place to memorialize the dead.
"I worry that people of all faiths," he said, "and in particular Catholics, are making decisions that will have profound spiritual implications without fully contemplating the impact."

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/dentons-dacheng-merger-raises-questions/docview/1648469792/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Leaders of international firm Dentons and Beijing's Dacheng met Tuesday morning for a signing ceremony to bring China's largest law firm into the fold of an already globe-spanning legal practice that includes Canada's former Fraser Milner Casgrain LLP.

Full text:   The creation of the world's largest law firm stands to smooth the path for new Chinese investments into Canadian finance and agriculture, even as it raises questions about how well China's legal establishment can mesh with Western practices.
Leaders of international firm Dentons and Beijing's Dacheng met Tuesday morning for a signing ceremony to bring China's largest law firm into the fold of an already globe-spanning legal practice that includes Canada's former Fraser Milner Casgrain LLP. The new firm assembles under one banner 6,500 lawyers in more than 50 countries. The deal was first announced last week but signed Tuesday in Beijing after securing Chinese regulatory approval. The new Dentons has "brought together East and West in a way no other law firm has done before," Joe Andrew, global chairman at Dentons, said in an interview.
"This is the holy grail for every large, global law firm."
But the deal's consummation also sets in motion a grand experiment to see whether a mainland Chinese law firm - with vastly different compensation practices and lawyers accustomed to working in a corrupt country with politically controlled courts - can successfully merge with a foreign legal operation.
"All of our clients are starting to globalize, and we as lawyers can only be successful by following our clients and also being globalized," said Peng Xuefeng, the founding partner of Dacheng who will become global board chairman at the new firm. "Our combination obviously provides a very good global platform, and a very effective bridge for Chinese companies who want to go abroad."
He said that could bring more than just energy deals to Canada.
"Chinese investors are starting to look at very diversified investments, including financial industries, real estate, transportation, telecommunications," he said.
One of his own major clients is "in the agricultural industry, and they are very keen to explore investment opportunities in Canada as well."
With 4,000 lawyers in 51 offices, Dacheng touches each of China's administrative regions, a strength in a country where success is often determined by the ability to navigate local practices and relationships.
For all the potential benefits of combining forces with Chinese lawyers, Western law firms have been hesitant out of fears that doing so could expose them to Foreign Corrupt Practices Act violations, potential troubles with cybersecurity or vexing cultural questions. Among them can be a laxer attitude toward conflict of interest at Chinese law firms and different compensation practices.
Many Chinese lawyers are paid a fixed percentage of their individual gross billings and maintain their own secretaries and support staff. "It's what we would call a hotel for lawyers," said Peter Zeughauser, a consultant to law firms. "What that means is there's no reason why any lawyer would encourage sharing of work with other partners."
Dentons executives played down the risks, saying the firm is already "poly-centric" and experienced in assembling and managing operations across all sorts of places.

Abstract: Head brewer Claire Monk agrees. "It's very much the oldfashioned way of teaching," she says. "You teach by telling and showing and doing." It's how she learned to brew and how she trains her employees. Despite being maybe the youngest female head brewer in Britain, Monk, 27, has firmly established the Welbeck Abbey Brewery as an award-winning producer.

Full text:   The resident bakers arrive in the night. Then, at 6:30 a.m., the milk begins pumping from the cows to the dairy, where cheese makers start another batch of famed Stichelton blue cheese. Down the road, past the farm shop, art gallery, café, offices and artist studios, novice bakers knead dough in the former Victorian firehouse. Across the lane, brewers ferment an experimental stout using malt smoked over beechwood chips.
This is the Welbeck Estate, and a visitor's initial impression is of a Downton Abbey fantasy for the 21st-century epicurean. Tucked within the legendary Sherwood Forest, the 15,000-acre estate focuses on the teaching of ageold craft. In so doing, it has become a hub of artisan knowledge with very few peers.
The estate has seen several metamorphoses over its 875-year history: from a 12th-century Premonstratensian abbey to a ducal country house (where Archduke Franz Ferdinand almost perished in a hunting accident a year before his 1914 assassination) to an army headquarters during the Second World War. In 2005, the current owners, the Parente family, decided to inject some economic energy into the former coal region by focusing on artisan food.
A year later, a herd of organically raised Holstein cows attracted the first business when Randolph Hodgson, owner of Neal's Yard Dairy in London, and American-born cheese maker Joe Schneider asked to make a rawmilk, Stilton-style cheese on the estate, which they called Stichelton. That same year, family matriarch Alison Swan Parente established the commercial bakery. She added a non-profit school in 2009, followed by a panoply of courses, in which about 2,000 people will participate this year. A government lottery grant funds classes for schoolchildren, which Parente believes will make real change in the greater culture, reclaiming knowledge that was nearly lost because of industrialized food.
"When you work with your hands, there's a connection to your brain in a way a machine can't do," says Shelly Preston, the estate's resident chocolatier.
"You feel the product, you have a relationship with the product.
You take the hands away and it becomes a very different product."
Head brewer Claire Monk agrees. "It's very much the oldfashioned way of teaching," she says. "You teach by telling and showing and doing." It's how she learned to brew and how she trains her employees. Despite being maybe the youngest female head brewer in Britain, Monk, 27, has firmly established the Welbeck Abbey Brewery as an award-winning producer.
The estate's crown jewel is the School of Artisan Food, where one can learn, in a half-day or up to a year, everything from lactic cheese-making to game butchery.
And it's not just moneyed food obsessives - workers and students here cut across diverse backgrounds and classes (this is Britain, after all).
On the day I visit, the most popular course has 14 first-time bakers learning to knead and get the right tack on wholemeal dough. David Carter, the baking co-ordinator, lingers at the back, assisting the instructor. Laid off after 30 years as a solicitor, Carter took a day course here, then soon returned for more study, before being offered a full-time job.
Whether for a first or second career, the school attracts students from varying backgrounds: a veteran bomb-disposal expert, a son of a local coal miner and a supermarket merchandiser in her 50s. Industry workers also attend the professional courses for continuing education.
Canadian cheese maker Ruth Klahsen, owner of Monforte Dairy in Stratford, Ont., recently visited Welbeck to research her own educational venture. No school in North America teaches cheese making, so this spring she is organizing a course for eight students. "I got kids on the floor here who made a $5,000 mistake," says Klahsen, explaining that such training is expensive but necessary. "Ten thousand dollars to educate somebody for eight weeks seems like a lot, but [you] lose that much out of one bad error that you make out of a lack of education."
The artisan revival in Britain has meant many eager producers setting up shop before mastering their craft. This results in artisanlabelled products of dubious quality, says Henrietta Green, a British food writer and consultant. The next step toward quality, she believes, should be the reinstatement of the apprenticeship system. "There's nothing like working in a business, the sense of the routine, the practice, the making, to really learn the skill set."
In a market awash in opportunistically branded "artisan" products, Welbeck graduates are paramount in maintaining quality. Last year, the school won top prize at the British Cookery School Awards, an indication that its hands-on approach is really influencing how Britons learn to cook and what they get to eat. When asked about the school's future ambitions, Parente replies: "World domination."

Canada's Hippie Outpost: Spend a little time in Nelson, B.C. and you'll soon fall under the spell of its laid-back, counterculture vibe. But the best part, writes Tom Maloney, is the mind-blowing ski resort in its backyard

Abstract: "When three Calgarians bought Whitewater, the whole community was a little excited," says Dean Prodan, one of the new owners, and by "excited" he means they viewed the purchase with trepidation. "People said: 'Don't change the place; don't change the menu.' Why would we? We can't compete with the big areas, like Revelstoke and Fernie. We're trying to keep it small, peoplefriendly."

Full text:   Wearing colourful ski clothing, his long, grey hair tied in a Willie Nelson-styled ponytail, a laid-back local perched on the chairlift in front of us and began swinging his legs rhythmically. A whitish puff of smoke bloomed over his head, then another, and as its trail drifted downwind, we breathed in the sweet, pungent smell of the local "cash crop."
Since none of Whitewater Ski Resort's three chairlifts are highspeed, it takes a while for the Glory Ridge chair to make its 823metre climb. Before boarding, we heard the local, who appeared to be in his late 60s, maybe early 70s, tell the lift attendant that he'd just punched his season pass for the 100th time. And now, during the entire way up, he celebrated by moving in tune with the music flowing through his ear buds. We wanted to catch him, get his story - maybe he belonged to the hippie generation of Vietnam War draft dodgers who populated the area. But once up top, he dove seamlessly into a glade run, skis barely whispering as they carved through soft snow and swerved through the trees.
Whoosh ... gone.
That memory lingers as a snapshot that seemed to say so much about the small city of Nelson, B.C., and its local ski hill.
Tucked reclusively into the Kootenay region of south-central British Columbia, Whitewater remains a veritable secret to many skiers and snowboarders.
Whitewater manages to keep its best-kept-secret status despite receiving an annual 12 metres of dry powder, 479 hectares (1,184 acres) of skiable terrain and the absence of lift lines - all punctuated by a ski-lodge menu that might otherwise be found in a trendy Vancouver restaurant. An easy 20minute drive from Nelson - although, while irrepressibly scenic, for tourists it is a potentially daunting trip, depending on the weather - the ski hill remains by and large an enviable playground for the locals who like it this way just fine.
While we ate lunch on the deck of Coal Oil Johnny's Pub at Whitewater one day, two friendly male retirees talked about their hiking forays to access virgin powder in the chutes. They gave us some tips on skiing the mountain before asking where we hailed from.
"Ontario," my ski buddy, Eric, confessed.
Did we plan on staying a while?
No definite plans, we said.
"Have you checked into Immigration?" one joked.
Who could blame them for putting a fence up around this mountainous oasis?
There's no slope-side accommodation here; ergo, a trip to ski Whitewater is a trip into Nelson (population 9,800). Settled in the 1880s, its peaceful, easy feeling was first influenced by a mass migration of the Russian pacifist group called the Doukhobors in 1908. In the 1960s, the surrounding forests of the Kootenay region, being so suitable to farming the "cash crop," attracted about 10,000 conscientious objectors from the United States. Marijuana harvesting provided income to some until they could gain residency or citizenship.
Many stayed, and today the town is a mix of landscape-art galleries, restaurants, throwback hippie culture, West Coast coffee-shop vibe and an irresistible outdoor life. While still branded as a counterculture enclave 50 years after the movement, these days fibreoptic cable is installed and business people are moving from Calgary and Vancouver to work remotely.
"The draft dodgers brought a lot," says Pat Renwick, partner in the town's Chrysler dealership and a dedicated Whitewater skier until his knee gave out at 80.
"They did not collect welfare.
They came from good families and good backgrounds and brought a lot of very good vocational ideas to Nelson. They were hippies; they had their own ways, but they fit in."
Nelson's topography resembles a mini-San Francisco as it climbs away from the eastern shore of Kootenay Lake. Downtown is constrained within a few restaurantfilled blocks principally along Baker Street, the architecture consisting of Victorian heritage buildings such as the iconic Hume Hotel with its illogical passageways and cozy bars. That the bridge across the lake is known as BOB - for Big Orange Bridge - tells you something about a place that doesn't take itself too seriously.
"We are hooked on the town and the lifestyle - and we don't smoke pot," says Shelley Adams, chef, author and former owner of the ski resort with her husband, Mike. "People say, 'Well, you must've grown marijuana [for income],' and honestly, there are a lot of funny, little shops in town.
You wonder how they survive.
They're still growing it, and apparently it's really, really good."
Adams, a European-trained chef who had been catering for movie productions in Vancouver, brought her talents to Whitewater's Fresh Tracks Café and has since self-published four renditions of Whitewater Cooks (the first contains a much-acclaimed recipe for the Glory Bowl). Under the new ownership, the ski lodge's cafeteria maintains its nogrease integrity with dishes such as Upcountry Panini (apple-butter pulled-pork, sweet chili pineapple, poppy seed slaw, spiced honey mayo), Herbivore Panini (honey-glazed yams, spinach, sesame-crusted eggplant, roasted red pepper, goat cheese, red curry hummus) and Vietnamese banh mi.
The town inspired her recipes.
"It's a very eclectic, unique community," she says. "Most people are here for the sports and the lifestyle, and they like to eat healthy."
Whitewater, marking a 40th anniversary next year, started operations as a local ski club operated by 10 volunteers, including Renwick. The Adamses took over ownership and ran it for 25 years until three Calgarians bought them out in 2008 and began boosting infrastructure.
"When three Calgarians bought Whitewater, the whole community was a little excited," says Dean Prodan, one of the new owners, and by "excited" he means they viewed the purchase with trepidation. "People said: 'Don't change the place; don't change the menu.' Why would we? We can't compete with the big areas, like Revelstoke and Fernie. We're trying to keep it small, peoplefriendly."
There are plans for modest real estate development, and a need to renovate a worn chalet; otherwise, the owners are diligently maintaining the quaint character of a hill appreciated for its terrific variety of skiing, and its powder days. Two antiquated double chairs serve the traditional faces of Whitewater (runs are easy to advanced), Silver King and Summit offer intermediate and expert slopes, while the triple Glory Chair opened 31 runs that include a mixed bag of top-to-bottom blue cruisers, steeps, gullies, bumps and invigorating tree adventures, such as the one our weed-puffing chair buddy disappeared into.
The names of the runs hint at the backside experience: Knee Deep Glades, Giddyup Gully, Brake Line, Buckshot, Trash Glades, Bound for Glory and so on.
The men we conversed with, on the pub's outside deck at lunch, are among the many who hike toward peaks and into the backcountry for virgin powder in steep chutes on the old side.
"You can ski anywhere because when there's a big powder day, they don't pack it," Renwick says, meaning the hill restricts grooming to let the boarders and skiers enjoy the soft stuff.
"It's good all over. I skied the Summit chair and hiked over to the slide areas. You're still inbounds, and there are so many areas like that."
Whitewater isn't Whistler, Vail, Steamboat or Killington. Commercialism is near-absent. It's a skier's mountain pure and simple, and the food is better besides.
The writer was a guest of Nelson Kootenay Lake Tourism. It did not review or approve the story.
IF YOU GO
Nelson, B.C., is a three-hour (if you're lucky), 230-kilometre mountainous drive west from the Cranbrook airport along snowbound Highway 3, the most elevated highway in North America. There are other options: 1) A rolling, 45-minute, 45-km trek north from the West Kootenay Regional Airport in Castlegar - nicknamed "Cancelgar" for the winter fog that prevents planes from landing; 2) A four-hour, 324km drive along Highways 97 and 3, south and east from the diminutive Penticton, B.C., airport in the Okanagan Valley; and 3) a three-hour, 240-km trip north from Spokane, Wash.
WHERE TO STAY
We stayed at the Cloudside Inn, a B&B with a top-floor, twobedroom apartment, steps from Nelson's highly reputed coffee shop, Oso Negro. Rooms from $119. 408 Victoria St., cloudside.ca.
Also try the Hume Hotel, a 45-room, 116-year-old property on Vernon Street. Rooms from $119, including breakfast. humehotel.com.
Visit Whitewater resort's website (skiwhitewater.com) for "ski-and-stay" options, including local cat-skiing.
WHERE TO EAT
Nelson's All Seasons Café, tucked away in a back alley, is a can't-miss. It's tough to beat the halibut cheeks with Thai yellow coconut curry sauce.
Jackson's Hole & Grill is a friendly sports bar with tasty burgers and an informal atmosphere. The Hume Hotel's Library Lounge is one of those pubs you can settle into for a while; the prime-rib dinner is the specialty on weekends.

Full text:   If a penny saved is a penny earned, surely it is worth it to save a Dollar.
On Jan. 13, the modest Silver Dollar Room, a cement growth in the shadow of the Hotel Waverly, was deemed by city council as being of cultural heritage value or interest. The preservation status has to do with the musical tradition of a small, dusky room at 486 Spadina Ave. that has seen strippers strip, Bobby Bland do blues and Bob Dylan be Dylan.
Rumour has it that James Earl Ray (the convicted assassin of Martin Luther King) refreshed himself at the lounge while on the lam in 1968. Rumour probably has it wrong, but history's details are up for grabs, and so is commercial real estate.
The Dollar's official designation comes one year after the city turned down a developer's scheme to tear down the saloon (and the attached Hotel Waverly) to make room for a 22-storey mixed-use building, which would house a private student residence on its top 20 floors and a revamped Silver Dollar Room at ground level.
The rejection to that proposal was appealed by the buildings' owners (Wynn Group) to the Ontario Municipal Board. Final statements are to be presented at a hearing on Jan. 30.
There's nothing particularly significant about the architecture of the Dollar or the Hotel Waverly. In fact, the city only designated the Dollar - and not the attached turn-of-the-century flophouse - as a heritage site, a decision that has caused concern among the preservationist crowd.
"In my opinion, the two buildings are peas in a pod," says architect Michael McClelland, a witness for the city's side in the case currently in front of the OMB. "I don't agree with designating just one part."
As for the building's bland appearance, Mr. McClelland believes that the determining factor in a structure's worth and standing should be more than design. "I think it is very important that we don't look at these buildings in isolation, but how they contribute to create a street."
The area of Spadina Avenue at College Street is notable for three storied music venues: Grossman's Tavern, the in-limbo El Mocambo and the Silver Dollar. Of the trio, the latter's history might be the most colourful. "Try to come along Spadina Avenue, see that goddam Silver Dollar sign, hundreds of light bulbs in your face, and not be drawn in there," wrote Elmore Leonard, for the opening of his 1989 novel Killshot.
The Silver Dollar opened in Jan. 5, 1959, with entertainment that night coming from the swingrock crew Tommy Danton and the Echoes, billed in a newspaper ad as "Canada's Top Variety Group."
An article in The Globe and Mail in 1962 described the venue as raucous - "no place to go for meditation."
In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the Dollar was the city's top blues venue. Magic Slim and the Teardops were regular visitors, and there was the night of the free lollipops when Chicago's Chico Banks launched his risqué Candy Lickin' Man album there.
The Dollar is distinctive for its horizontal layout, which adds intimacy. It has a classic classylounge design, but there's a dustiness to the room, with its inside murals (images of B.B. King, Muddy Waters and Chuck Berry) evoking a bygone era.
But if the Dollar was no place for meditation in 1962, it isn't now either. "It's a terrific spot," says Dan Burke, the room's main talent booker for more than three years now. "It's one of the top mid-size venues around in the world of indie rock."
A venue is only as good as its programming, and Mr. Burke keeps the Dollar vibrant. Local indie stars who got their start in the room include Deadly Snakes, Death From Above 1979, Pup, Alvvays and Tokyo Police Club. The Dollar routinely hosts the most buzzed-about showcases during the annual Canadian Music Week and NXNE festivals.
"It's nice to see that [the] city is paying attention to a music venue," Mr. Burke says, "but we'll see what happens."
The decision by the OMB on the fate of the venue will likely be made this spring. The loss of the Dollar would be costly to the city's musical lineage, if nothing else - we really are talking some serious coin here.

Abstract: Mr. [Ron Veitch], 65, and Ms. [Karen Benson], 68, were financial planners and "serial entrepreneurs" renting a condo in Vancouver, but they always knew they wanted to come "home" to retire, Mr. Veitch says. "The other side of it was, too much rain and gloom in Vancouver. We thought the weather would be better in southwestern Ontario."

Full text:   This is one of six articles about Canadian communities picked by readers as great places for retirement.
When Ron Veitch and Karen Benson first visited Ridgetown, Ont., a sign caught their attention. It proclaimed the community's motto: "The Friendliest Town in Ontario."
Though he appreciated the sentiment, Mr. Veitch says he didn't take it too seriously. But after he and his wife retired to Ridgetown from Vancouver in March of 2013, they discovered there was more to it than marketing.
"We hadn't been here two weeks and our neighbours threw a party to introduce us to everyone on the block," Mr. Veitch says. Then a next-door neighbour invited Mr. Veitch to his barn, showed him where he kept the key saying, "There are lots of tools here - use whatever you want."
"It was quite a difference for us from living in downtown Toronto and then Vancouver," he says.
"That wasn't a throwaway line, it is a friendly place to be."
Ridgetown is one of the small communities that make up the Chatham-Kent municipality that nestles between Lake St. Clair and Lake Erie, about 300 kilometres southwest of Toronto.
Mostly rural and agricultural, Chatham-Kent is dotted with towns such as Ridgetown (population 3,250), Tilbury, Blenheim, Wheatley and Dresden, as well as larger centres such as Chatham and Wallaceburg. With affordable housing, proximity to airports, mild climate, provincial parks and plentiful beaches, ChathamKent is increasingly drawing city boomers looking for a more relaxed pace in a small-town setting.
Mr. Veitch, 65, and Ms. Benson, 68, were financial planners and "serial entrepreneurs" renting a condo in Vancouver, but they always knew they wanted to come "home" to retire, Mr. Veitch says. "The other side of it was, too much rain and gloom in Vancouver. We thought the weather would be better in southwestern Ontario."
The couple looked at a lot of houses and finally fell in love with a 1920s-era home on a treelined street in Ridgetown.
"We do a fair amount of travel, so between Toronto and Detroit [airports], we've got the international flights covered, and for regional flights, we've got Windsor and London. That made a whole lot of sense," Mr. Veitch says.
With a population of only 104,000 spread out over 2,500 square kilometres, ChathamKent's geography is a definite draw for new 50-plus residents, says Audrey Ansell, municipality manager of resident attraction and retention.
"If you want space, big skies and unbelievable sunsets, this is the place."
She describes the area as a geographic sweet spot. "We're an hour to Windsor, an hour to London, an hour to Sarnia, 2.5 to three hours to Toronto, with five U.S. border crossings all within an hour."
Another part of ChathamKent's appeal is affordable housing. For example, the year-to-date average sale price of houses in Chatham-Kent was $152,000.
"The tagline we use is that you can live the dream without breaking the bank," Ms. Ansell says.
Affordability was definitely a factor for Tony and Jennifer Hill, who decided to move to Chatham four years ago.
Mr. Hill, 70 and Ms. Hill, 69, who were downtown Toronto real estate brokers at the time, were visiting family in the area.
After an impressive meal at a "super little restaurant that would have fit into Bloor Street or Mt. Pleasant in Toronto," Mr.
Hill says the couple started exploring. They ended up selling their home and business in Toronto and bought a bungalow on the scenic Thames River.
"We were able to buy a fabulous property on the river that was built by a locally famous architect, and you couldn't buy a decent condo for that in Toronto," he says.
The Hills had planned to retire, but they opened a new real estate business in Chatham so that they could meet people.
"You can buy a 1970s side-split with a garage and finished rec room for $140,000 to $160,000 on a fenced lot in a nice subdivision with tall trees and all that.
Or you can buy a brand-new or nearly new house in an area called Prestancia and that same type of property would cost you about $250,000 to 300,000," he says.
The Hills appreciate that Chatham is smaller than Toronto, but not too small. The local Capitol Theatre hosts numerous charity events, performances and concerts. There are two wineries and a microbrewery.
The municipality is the No. 1 producer in Canada of tomatoes, carrots, seed corn and pumpkins, and the No. 1 producer in Ontario of broccoli, green peas and cauliflower. Because of the area's agricultural bounty, farmers' markets are plentiful, as are culinary events such as the annual C-K Table festival, and there is a flourishing local food movement.
"We have two provincial parks and lots of birding and swimming, all sorts of boating. Jennifer and I both have kayaks and we do a lot of paddling, a lot of walking, so it's very good from that point of view," Mr. Hill says.
Ms. Ansell adds, "Mitchell's Bay [on the east shore of Lake St.
Clair] has some of the best smallmouth bass and pickerel fishing in North America." ChathamKent also boasts 11 public libraries and 11 seniors' centres with exercise facilities and programming.
When it comes to health-care facilities, the Chatham-Kent Health Alliance has campuses in Chatham and Wallaceburg, Ms. Ansell says. Both of these hospitals act as teaching sites for the Schulich School of Medicine at the University of Western Ontario in London, Ont.
Like many rural Ontario municipalities, Chatham-Kent is served by family health teams, which means better access to doctors on evenings and weekends.
"For specialist treatment, you've got London and Windsor.
Some of the treatments are not on our doorstep, but they are not that far away, and we have a number of orthopedic surgeons in town," Ms. Ansell says.
Since moving, Mr. Veitch and Ms. Benson both volunteer - with the municipality's economic development advisory committee, and Ms. Benson with a business association and farmers' market.
"We've been self-employed all our lives ... we thought we had skills that perhaps could be useful," Ms. Benson says.
Ms. Ansell says that ChathamKent is a great destination for people looking to put down roots and get involved. "If you're looking for that kinship, that sense of belonging, that's here."

Abstract: In December for detached houses, the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver's home price index reached a record $2,325,200 on Vancouver's west side and a near-record $1,998,600 in West Vancouver. Most neighbourhoods in the suburbs of North Vancouver, Richmond and Burnaby have detached prices that are typically above $1-million.

Full text:   The number of posh properties that sold last year in the Vancouver region swelled, setting a new record.
There were 842 homes that fetched $3-million or more in 2014, up 31 per cent from a sales volume of 644 in 2013, according to Macdonald Realty Group's compilation of data from two local real estate boards. Last year's performance smashed the previous record of 691 luxury sales in 2011.
In the elite segment, single-family detached houses dominate sales, although many condos also carry big price tags, said Dan Scarrow, vice-president of corporate strategy at Macdonald Realty.
Ottawa shut down the federal immigrant investor program last February, prompting concerns in the housing industry about the impact of a potential decline in sales for the most expensive homes, especially on Vancouver's west side and the district municipality of West Vancouver.
Instead, the number of luxury properties changing hands has soared, said Mr. Scarrow. "Looking at the statistics, I've been surprised that the high-end sales remain so strong, even after the cancellation of the federal program. You would think by now we would have already felt the effects of that," Mr. Scarrow said in an interview.
There were 199 Metro Vancouver properties that sold last year on the Multiple Listing Service for at least $5-million, breaking the previous high of 148 set in 2013.
Some observers say the effect of buyers from mainland China has been exaggerated, but the influx of rich immigrants can't be ignored.
"While recently released Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. data indicates foreign ownership may be lower than previously believed, international investment is still a significant driver in the high end of the Vancouver real estate market," said a report released earlier this month by Sotheby's International Realty Canada.
The price of admission into neighbourhoods on Vancouver's west side is steep. In November, for instance, the selling price for existing homes averaged $2.2-million in Kerrisdale, $4.1-million in Point Grey/University Endowment Lands and $5.6-million in Shaughnessy, according to data collected by Sotheby's.
The broader real estate market in Metro Vancouver - meaning Greater Vancouver and the Fraser Valley - remains buoyant. Volume climbed more than 16 per cent last year for the entire range of single-family detached homes, condos and townhouses in the region, although total sales activity ranked in the middle of the 10year average.
A stable B.C. economy, low interest rates and continued migration of people from other provinces and overseas have combined to lift prices generally in Metro Vancouver's real estate sector. The benchmark home index price, which strips out the most expensive resale properties, climbed to a record $1,002,200 last month for a typical detached house in Greater Vancouver. In the Fraser Valley, including the less expensive suburb of Surrey, the index hit $573,100 last month, just shy of the record for a detached property.
Within the City of Vancouver last year, there were 3,134 properties that sold for least $1-million, up 25 per cent from a sales volume of 2,505 in 2013, Sotheby's said.
"A million-dollar property isn't even the lot value on Vancouver's west side. A million bucks isn't going to buy you much these days in Vancouver housing," said Mr. Scarrow, who opened a Macdonald Realty office in September in Shanghai.
Research by Andrew Yan, an urban planner with Bing Thom Architects, shows that 37,425 homes, or 55.2 per cent of the total detached properties on the assessment rolls, were pegged as being worth at least $1-million in mid-2013 within the City of Vancouver.
In December for detached houses, the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver's home price index reached a record $2,325,200 on Vancouver's west side and a near-record $1,998,600 in West Vancouver. Most neighbourhoods in the suburbs of North Vancouver, Richmond and Burnaby have detached prices that are typically above $1-million.

Abstract: "This thing sparkles in the sunshine. I'm sorry you're seeing it under a west coast mildew," said Ms. [Carole Itter]. "The beauty about working on it is that I knew it was never going anywhere. It was never going into a gallery and it was never going to be on the market. And now I realize it's going to a dump. Or as Al says, let the bugs eat it."

Full text:   Carole Itter drags her shopping cart over gnarled roots and slippery rocks along the uneven oceanside trail leading from the little blue cabin on Vancouver's North Shore to her car, a duck decoy inside the little buggy.
Ms. Itter, 75, is slowly emptying the cabin where she and Al Neil have been making art and music for decades. They received an eviction notice from Port Metro Vancouver in the fall with a Jan. 31 deadline to vacate, and a demolition permit has been issued for Feb. 1.
"We've been living on this roller coaster," says Ms. Itter, at the cabin Monday afternoon. "My knees are still weak."
Now a number of prominent players on the local art scene are working to save the little cabin that tells a big story about Vancouver's history.
The waterfront area was once home to a number of squatters - many of whom were artists, including the author Malcolm Lowry. He lived in a series of shacks in what is now Cates Park, where he wrote much of his classic Under the Volcano . The nearby cabin that has been home and studio to Mr. Neil and Ms. Itter is believed to have been made in Coal Harbour by a Scandinavian craftsman in the 1930s.
Mr. Neil, now 90 - a musician, composer and visual artist who received the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Vancouver Mayor's Arts Award last year - has lived in the cabin on and off since 1966, serving as a sort of beach watchman for the company next door, McKenzie Barge.
He initially paid rent to the shipyard - $15 a month, "and then eventually they said don't bother," says Ms. Itter, a sculptor and writer who joined Mr. Neil 13 years after he moved in.
"It's been a huge, huge part of our lives," she says. "It's been the source of inspiration for both of us."
One assemblage - she figures it's 45 feet wide - is suspended between (and beyond) two tall cedars, across a little beach from the cabin. Made by the artists over decades, the ever-changing work is clearly tied to the place, its days now numbered.
"This thing sparkles in the sunshine. I'm sorry you're seeing it under a west coast mildew," said Ms. Itter. "The beauty about working on it is that I knew it was never going anywhere. It was never going into a gallery and it was never going to be on the market. And now I realize it's going to a dump. Or as Al says, let the bugs eat it."
McKenzie Barge was sold to Polygon Homes, which is planning to develop the land - building townhomes and condos. The sale triggered the eviction notice from Port Metro Vancouver after environmental reports indicated the cabin is located in an area "extensively contaminated" with metals, including arsenic, lead and mercury. The letter warned Mr. Neil that if the structures were not gone by Jan. 31, Port Metro Vancouver would remove them "at your cost and expense."
"That shook us," says Ms. Itter. "We don't own real estate, we're not well-to-do. We have a little savings, and if it all gets tied up in that, I don't know what we would do."
Anna Deeley, a spokeswoman for Port Metro Vancouver, told The Globe and Mail in a statement: "The removal of the unauthorized structure in question on port land in North Vancouver is required in order to complete a habitat restoration project that will remove contaminants from port land and restore the natural shoreline, promoting human and aquatic health."
Ms. Deeley says that as of late Friday there has been no request to extend the eviction deadline, but added that the demolition may not happen on Feb. 1.
A number of figures in the local art community have gotten involved, and efforts are now under way to try to remove the cabin and find a new home for it.
"We live in such a redevelopment city and there's so little of heritage that gets saved here and I think this is a very important piece of Vancouver heritage that we should all really think about before we let it go," says Glenn Alteen with the Grunt Gallery.
Michael Audain - the founder of Polygon and a generous cultural philanthropist and art collector himself - says the company is willing to help defray the cost of relocating the cabin.
"I've said from day one I think it's an important relic of the cultural scene in Vancouver where a lot of artists and writers happily lived on the edge of the forest and the sea, kind of on the margins of Vancouver and I think it would be nice if we could help preserve ... that last home," Mr. Audain said on Monday.
"We're just waiting for instructions as to where we can move it to."

The Rising: With the drop in oil prices, Ontario is being touted again for its economic potential. Adam Radwanski travels to revitalized Rust Belt cities in the United States, to see how they have remade themselves and what Canada's sputtering engine can learn from them

Author: Radwanski, Adam

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/rising/docview/1646103603/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: When Tom Murphy was mayor in the 1990s, locals were asked to pay an additional percentage point on top of the state's sales tax, with ensuing revenues leading to well over $1-billion in investment in the city's core assets. Mr. Murphy also freed up more money for urban development by slashing police and other budgets.

Full text:   "They were telling their children to get out as soon as they were able. ut much of what John and I loved about Akron was the very argument those forefathers were making: the abandoned landscape, the hard challenge, the long odds. We saw the same things but in a very different way, with an absolute belief that something was to be saved here, that lives were to be made, that we could remake all this as our own."
David Giffels, The Hard Way on Purpose
Ribs and beers were on the table. The firepit was crackling. And a TV was mounted to the back of a truck so that we could watch the football game, tailgate style. Wearing a Browns jersey, Richey Piiparinen bounces around the starter home in the blue-collar neighbourhood that he, his fiancée and their baby daughter have recently moved into - making sure we all have enough to eat and drink, and bantering with a burly army veteran turned stand-up comedian he grew up with.
When he finally sits down, Cleveland's leading urbanologist makes the passionate case for why Rust Belt cities like his - for all the economic pain they've suffered, people they've lost to more prosperous places, jokes made at their expense - are where the future is.
Snicker if you will. But as young Americans recoil from the 20th century's suburban sprawl and are priced out of New York City and San Francisco and Washington, the Rust Belt offers an alternative within the bones of once-great cities. Past glories have bequeathed a legacy of well-respected universities, cultural entities, attractive neighbourhoods and gritty industrial spaces. Courtesy of past exoduses, the cost of living is often jawdroppingly low. And for those who seek a sense of community, there is a chance to be leaders in (re)building. "There's this psychogeographic pull, this humanness," is how Mr. Piiparinen puts it. "We all have this longing to be part of something."
There has been less longing, in recent years, to be part of our own country's version of a rust belt - the one that comprises such Southwestern Ontario cities as Windsor, London and St. Catharines, and patches of Eastern Ontario. Young people have fled in droves as the region's employment numbers have tanked, seeing the loss of more than a quarter of manufacturing jobs in the last decade.
The plight of the region has been a driving force behind a provincial deficit that remains at over $10-billion, as well as a net loss for Ontario in the migration of people within Canada, and an alarmingly aging population.
Even with Alberta driving the national economy, the country could ill afford Ontario's struggles; it's hardly healthy for the largest province's per-capita GDP to be lower than the rest of Canada's, and it helps explain why the federal government has remained in the red.
With oil's current slide, Canada really can't afford for it to remain a drag - and in fact there is some expectation that Ontario will instead reclaim its old role as the leader of Canada's economic growth. Its premier, Kathleen Wynne, recently expressed optimism that plummeting oil prices and a sinking dollar will prove a boon to manufacturing. "I don't wish for low oil prices and a low dollar for Alberta," she said earlier this month. "But at the same time, we want our manufacturing sector to rebound. So if that [low oil price] helps, then that's a good thing."
While they could indeed help in the short term, it's difficult to imagine those volatile factors leading to the lasting revival of traditional sectors competing with consistently low-cost jurisdictions such as Mexico, China and even the American South.
For sustainable renewal, Ontario's old industrial towns will have to work harder at reinvention - and they should be looking to some of their counterparts in the U.S. A two-week road trip through Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan revealed in often surprising ways how our neighbours are much further along in reinventing their most hard-hit cities, and how much we have to learn.
"The wind is at the back of these cities in a way that it wasn't before," says Jennifer Vey, a fellow at the Brookings Institute who studies the revitalization of old industrial centres. And although many of them will remain smaller than in their industrial heyday, the numbers bear that sentiment out. When the Manhattan Institute ranked America's 100 biggest U.S. metropolitan areas for their economic performance in the wake of the Great Recession, midsize Northeastern and Midwestern cities accounted for nine of the top 20.
As Mr. Piiparinen and others are quick to stress, jobs will always be the cornerstone of any regeneration. But employers themselves can be drawn to a city by affordability and infrastructure, and like to set up shop where highly skilled people want to put down roots. The renaissance of former industrial powerhouses is fuelled by attracting and keeping well-educated, entrepreneurial citizens committed to community-building and capable of creating wealth and quality of life around them.
Of course, direct comparisons between the U.S. and Canadian experience is never exact: The places I visited tended to be larger than their Canadian counterparts; and although they may have such superior amenities as major-league sports teams and world-class museums, they also suffer from some entrenched disadvantages - notably an appalling history of race relations that has left a legacy of poverty, crime and troubled public schools.
So why is it that a younger generation is finding opportunity in these Rust Belt cities (or some of them, at least; nobody sees Flint, Mich., or Gary, Ind., as models) more than in places like London or Windsor, which have some decent bones themselves? As Ontario attempts to take back Canada's economic reins, it would do well to learn from what's worked, and know what it's up against.
Tax rebates and budget cuts
"Are you a hockey fan?" I ask the mayor of Allentown, Pa., as he shows me around his baby: a gleaming new arena to host the Philadelphia Flyers' farm team. A short and stocky transplanted Chicagoan with a thin mustache, gruff manner and reputation for elbows-out politics, Ed Pawlowski gives a wheezy laugh.
"I am now," he answers.
Part of a $272-million sports, office and hotel complex, the arena is the centrepiece around which the eastern Pennsylvania city's dilapidated downtown is being rapidly rebuilt - part of an astounding commitment by the state that speaks to the urgency with which governments have been pursuing urban renewal. For a 30-year period that began in 2009, Pennsylvania has designated a 52-hectare swath of Allentown's core as a "neighbourhood improvement zone" or NIZ: Nearly all taxes collected from tenants there - in new or rehabilitated buildings - are being returned to developers for debt financing, which in turn allows them to offer cheaper rents.
Well beyond the arena complex, which was the impetus for the NIZ, the improvement zone has turned downtown into a construction zone as well - one where, Mr. Pawlowski hopes, "young professionals will want to stay and be engaged." For reasons of affordability, Pennsylvania has rebuffed requests from other municipalities to institute the same program. But it is an example of the extent to which Rust Belt governments are using tax instruments and tools to drive dense urban development.
Most common among those is tax-increment financing, which has made TIF something close to a household acronym south of the border, even as it is just entering the lexicon to the north of it. In its simplest terms, TIF involves creating designated downtown zones, inside of which governments forfeit property-tax gains that would normally result from rising land values that follow new development; in most cases, the money is directed back into the zones' infrastructure. To encourage developers to make use of land in cities' cores, rather than building outward, many cities are also offering "brownfield" tax credits to offset the costs of cleaning up and converting shuttered factories.
The willingness to use tax incentives - and taxes themselves - has been only one part of a brash willingness to take financial risks in pursuing urban renewal. In few places has that been more evident than in Pittsburgh, often considered the gold standard of Rust Belt revitalization for the way it bounced back from the calamitous collapse of its steel industry in the 1980s.
When Tom Murphy was mayor in the 1990s, locals were asked to pay an additional percentage point on top of the state's sales tax, with ensuing revenues leading to well over $1-billion in investment in the city's core assets. Mr. Murphy also freed up more money for urban development by slashing police and other budgets. Even so, the city still plunged deeply into debt restoring its riverfronts, buying up abandoned land that the private sector wouldn't, and rebuilding Pittsburgh's historic Market Square. "Everyone thought he was crazy," recalls Don Carter, a director at Carnegie Mellon University's Remaking Cities Institute, who calls Mr. Murphy "visionary."
Although Mr. Murphy still has his critics, in part because the debt he accrued helped force the cash-strapped city into a form of state oversight, Pittsburgh's core is booming. Last year, The Economist ranked it as the most livable city in the continental U.S. And scarcely anybody there denies that its economic reinvention in advanced manufacturing, lifesciences and information technology - which have seen a host of start-up successes - has something to do with becoming a place young professionals want to be.
The likes of Google and Disney have even set up shop. "Even as a flat-broke city, we built really world-class stuff," says Mr. Murphy, as we sit down for breakfast at a diner on Pittsburgh's edgy North Shore. "People will say, 'You can't afford that.' You can't afford not to do it."
Public cutting, private giving
Even before Mr. Murphy took the mayor's office, Pittsburgh and other American cities experiencing a rebirth had a leg up because of a rich and enviable culture of philanthropy and corporate responsibility, the likes of which doesn't exist in Canada.
Still, for Jim Rohr, it was painfully obvious when he came to Pittsburgh in the 1980s that the city was falling apart - and he had the paint chips in his hair to prove it. "I was in the Stanley Theater with my wife, at a concert, and the black paint on the ceiling rained on our heads," recalls Mr. Rohr, who would go on to serve as chairman of PNC Bank, which he is credited for helping keep in the city. "It was a dump."
Today, that old dump has been restored and is one of the busiest theatres in the United States. And where once the streets around it were lined with sex shops and rampant with crime, the Stanley is now surrounded by a bustling cultural district - part of a revitalization in which Mr. Rohr played an active role, learning in the process about his adoptive city's civic culture.
Kevin McMahon, who heads the not-for-profit that manages the cultural district, says the city government was "preoccupied with triage" as Pittsburgh suffered 18-per-cent unemployment and lost roughly half its population after the steel mills closed. So business leaders, led by Jack Heinz of the food-processing family, stepped up to preserve and build upon core assets - from universities to riverfronts.
Other Rust Belt cities have, like Steeltown, been able to lean on foundations set up by the industrialist titans of their golden age. While Pittsburgh had the likes of Andrew Carnegie and Andrew Mellon, Cleveland can trace a good chunk of its recent development to the legacy of John D. Rockefeller. Of all the factors working for American cities relative to Canadian ones, this sort of philanthropy is perhaps the least imitable.
Perhaps more importable, though, is a willingness on the part of current American business leaders to continue investing in their communities. In Pittsburgh and other places, those leaders may still lobby for lower taxes, but they partially counterbalance their resistance to government spending with a willingness to spend heavily themselves.
In Grand Rapids, Mich., it was only later in the 20th century that a small number of business leaders and their families -almost exclusively Republicans - responded to their city becoming a ghost town by pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into it. First, that included funds for infrastructure and anchor institutions: a new arena, a convention centre and hospital expansions. More recently, it has meant funding ArtPrize, an enormous threeweek arts festival that has helped turn the west Michigan town into a destination.
It is impossible to get through a conversation in Grand Rapids without hearing about philanthropy. "You don't participate in this community if you don't give time and treasure," says John Kennedy, a staunch conservative who started an auto-parts company in the 1980s that is now worth over $250-million. "I'm not talking about giving back, because I don't believe in that. I'm talking about investing in the future of the community."
Tapping into the DIY vibe
Grand Rapids offers another important lesson for Canadian cities looking to reinvent themselves. Looking the part in an open-collared shirt, designer jeans and boat shoes, the golden boy of the city's most powerful family helps point the way.
"When you look at the birth of the auto industry, it was a bunch of goofballs working on things that were seen as frivolous toys in cowsheds," Rick DeVos tells me as we sit down to talk in his openconcept downtown office. "You had a bunch of lumber and mining guys tossing money at these goofballs. And eventually, out of this primordial soup emerged this unbelievable industry."
It's that "freewheeling entrepreneurial culture" that Mr. DeVos - the son of former Republican gubernatorial candidate Dick DeVos, and the grandson of Amway co-founder and Orlando Magic owner Richard DeVos - is trying to help recreate. Best known for using a bit of the family fortune to start ArtPrize, Mr. DeVos, who is in his early 30s, is now devoting most of his time to Start Garden - a $15-million venture-capital fund that offers an initial $5,000 to fledgling companies, and up to $500,000 if their venture takes off.
Every investment, Mr. DeVos says, is made "with the goal of building a west Michigan start-up ecosystem," which is why there are monthly public events at which funding recipients can get updates on each other's progress. Less than three years in, it's difficult to measure Start Garden's impact. But there are plenty of signs this city is reconnecting with its risk-taking roots.
Take Founders Brewing Company - where every young professional in town seems to congregate after work, and which helped kick-start a brewing boom that has the formerly sleepy town branding itself "Beer City USA." Started in the late 1990s by a pair of college buddies who had hustle but little business savvy, Founders was on the verge of shuttering in 2001 because of mounting debt.
Then, a millionaire who grew up during the Great Depression came on board as a sort of angel investor. Other investment followed, and Founders is now poised to make 600,000 barrels of beer a year. Meanwhile, it became an anchor for a local industry that has exploded to include roughly 15 breweries.
Not all the start-ups and emerging businesses in Grand Rapids are as sexy. Some are tied to auto parts and office furniture, the traditional manufacturing around which Grand Rapids was built. Others are in communications technology or health sciences. Notwithstanding some growing financial-services companies, they tend to fit into the region's proud history of making things.
As the Brookings Institute's Vey notes, that tradition - and the accompanying institutional knowledge and infrastructure - can help Rust Belt cities take advantage of the current "maker's movement," in which a DIY culture makes the manufacturing market accessible to small enterprises. And so too, she suggests, can the fact that real estate and other key costs - and thus the stakes of investing - are lower than in bigger cities that didn't go through the same economic struggles.
In Grand Rapids, there is a pattern of entrepreneurs getting support from established business leaders. Beyond Start Garden, for instance, there is Blue35. A partnership between the office-furniture giant Haworth and a construction company owned by the DeVos family, the eight-storey downtown office building aims to provide smaller companies with shared space and what's billed as state-of-the art technology.
However much business leaders around the Rust Belt tend to argue that the best thing government can do is get out of the way, states have also encouraged risk in ways Canadian provinces have been more hesitant about. Among the best examples is Pennsylvania's Ben Franklin Technology Partners. Launched in the 1980s, it has since provided many hundreds of millions of dollars in public funds to roughly 1,750 companies, largely in seed capital to start-ups. Purporting to have generated over 50,000 direct jobs and roughly 90,000 spinoffs, the program has been imitated around the United States.
The university connection
In some Rust Belt cities, though, it's unlikely that either private or public investment would have been enough without another form of leadership, from institutions that - like their Canadian counterparts - long functioned as near-islands. A wave of postsecondary leaders recognized that if their schools became more integrated with their communities, and more ambitious, they could become vital assets in rebuilding economies.
Luis Proenza, who didn't even know that Akron, Ohio, had a university until he was given the opportunity to be its president, is a prime example. Barely anyone in Akron knew who Mr. Proenza was, either, when he was hired away from Indiana's Purdue University in 1999. By the time he retired last year, he was lauded as one of the most influential figures in rebuilding the former rubber capital of the United States, after the devastating shutdown of its tire factories in the 1970s and eighties.
When Mr. Proenza came on board, the University of Akron had already started to play a research role in helping the city partially replace rubber with the production of related polymers. But it was still struggling to get past its local reputation as "Hilltop High," which reflected both the school's isolation from the surrounding town and its perceived academic standing.
Mr. Proenza changed that in part by fundraising enough for the public university to be able to invest over $600-million to overhaul the dilapidated campus, add an engineering school, and create 14 hectares of new green space. Now, however, it's not the physical upgrades about which he seems proudest - it's helping to have fostered a more entrepreneurial culture.
A new foundation aimed at commercializing research, he says, was "the single most important" economic initiative to emerge under his watch. It started off with no assets other than access to the university's intellectual property, and made the most of underappreciated resources left over from better times. Abandoned space became "incubator" space; companies donated or lent underutilized equipment; people who once worked in senior manufacturing jobs were invited to share expertise.
In a decade, Mr. Proenza now boasts, the foundation accumulated $16-million in net assets while launching 50 companies. It also started Akron Regional Change Angels, an agency that connects entrepreneurs with angel investors and mentors. Meanwhile, the university tried to gear its programs more toward areas likely to provide local employment.
Although Canadian universities have recently been making efforts to better address the needs of surrounding communities, it's not unusual for such an entrepreneurial focus to meet the sort of ethical resistance that Mr. Proenza concedes he also ran into. "Still, some of my colleagues do not believe university ought to have anything to do with industry - that's making a deal with the devil," he says, sitting in the lakeside home in which he has semi-retired about 80 kilometres outside of Akron. "The very concept of universities as anchor institutions in an economy is really of recent vintage."
Again, Pittsburgh was at the forefront of this kind of culture change. Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh never lacked respect, but through the steel era their connection to the city was limited. "Like [Canadian] universities, they're there, they educate kids, they do research," says Tom Murphy, the city's former mayor. "But they weren't an important player in the economy of the region."
Yet, in the 1980s, those institutions started working with the business community and each other to lead Pittsburgh's economic diversification. First, they identified a few high-tech sectors where research could be married with Pittsburgh's industrial heritage, such as the robotics field - which has since become one of the city's big success stories. Then they helped build infrastructure and the technology-transfer capacity to make it happen. Now, Mr. Murphy estimates, roughly half of Pittsburgh's jobs are connected to the two universities.
While some schools lack the resources to be so ambitious about creating jobs, simply helping to arrest the outflow of talented young people is just as important. When I met him in Cleveland, Richey Piiparinen had just released a study, which had appeared on the front page of the local newspaper, showing that a growing (and now unusually large) portion of younger members of the city's workforce hold advanced postsecondary degrees. It was an extremely encouraging sign for the future, he suggested; it was also an indication that people with other options were choosing to live in Cleveland.
Much of that choice has to do with the combined impact of Case Western Reserve University and the mammoth Cleveland Clinic, both of which have embraced roles as communitybuilders. Cleveland is among many cities that have pinned its economic hopes largely on "eds and meds," and its booming University Circle area - which in recent years has sprouted new housing, hotel and retail developments alongside hospital expansions and upgrades to existing museums - suggests that the bet is paying off.
'Americans crave realness'
Not all the factors in getting people to settle and do business in places they would once have fled are quite so tangible. Beyond academic initiatives, densification policies, philanthropy, and venture capital, the Rust Belt's rebirth also involves something more emotional. A big part of this story still comes down to identity, and to restoring pride to places in which it was long ago lost.
On the corner of Euclid Avenue and East 4th Street, in the heart of an emerging entertainment district, Cleveland Clothing Co. is making a virtue of past misfortune. On the list of things that helped turn Cleveland into a punchline, the time its river caught fire ranks pretty high. So alongside hoodies celebrating heartbreaks inflicted by local sports teams, the store these days sells "Burning River Surf Club" T-shirts, with an image of a skeleton riding a fiery wave.
Forty-five minutes down the highway, Akron's Rubber City Clothing is helping create local iconography, minus the selfmockery. "No negativity," store manager Angela Roloff says emphatically as she points to apparel that celebrates Akron's neighbourhoods, its history, and the return of basketball superstar and prodigal son LeBron James. But her goal is the same: to get people to stop apologizing for their hometowns and to celebrate them, instead.
As head of Positively Cleveland, the area's convention and tourism bureau, David Gilbert says that a key factor in attracting visitors to his city is what locals say about it to family, friends and strangers online. He also knows, from a study his organization commissioned, that Cleveland long fared horribly on that front. Attracting tourists, Mr. Gilbert says, means "changing perception from the inside out, not just the outside in."
Indications of emerging civic pride were everywhere during my visit. The city had just hosted the Gay Games, an international sports and culture festival; and locals were still boasting that participants who usually go to more glamorous locations had offered no end of positive reviews. For a city that has also landed the 2016 Republican National Convention, the Gay Games afforded a clear example of how major events can offer a citywide confidence boost.
There are also more granular efforts to change attitudes among the younger generation. Teaching Cleveland, started by a highschool teacher, works to get local history into classrooms. Another organization, iCleveland, offers "experiential civic education" to college students, through internships and interaction with community leaders. The non-profit that runs the University Circle area is making what its president calls an "intentional effort to get kids to understand their city before they leave their city," in part through a program that funds summer work for highschool students at local institutions.
It helps that there are more things in which to take pride than there used to be. The river that caught fire has been cleaned up; old theatres have been restored; the seedy Flats neighbourhood has been replaced as the top nightlife hub by Ohio City, a trendy area that has developed largely around the enormously successful Great Lakes microbrewery.
At the same time, much of what's starting to work for this part of the U.S. is its embrace of the character-building aspects of hardscrabble pasts - something Mr. Gilbert suggests could translate well to a city such as Windsor. It's an attitude perhaps best embodied by the iconic blast furnaces in Bethlehem, Pa., which sits just down the road from Allentown. There was talk of knocking those furnaces down after Bethlehem Steel closed in the nineties. Instead, they became the backdrop for the town's new arts centre and outdoor concert space; they're lit up at night, and a walkway is being built along them.
In The Hard Way on Purpose , his book about Akron and his experience coming of age there in the eighties and nineties, author David Giffels describes having the run of an abandoned town. In the shuttered factories and vacant storefronts, others saw only failure; he and some of his friends saw a legacy to claim as their own.
"Americans crave realness," Mr. Giffels told me, over grilledcheese sandwiches and craft beers at a bustling downtown Akron diner, and difficult decades had given cities like his a frozenin-time quality that satisfies that craving.
To Mr. Piiparinen, it's all about capitalizing on an existing identity rather than trying to create a new one.
"You don't want to fetishize grit," he says, as we celebrate Rust Belt character with a bit of good old tailgating in his backyard. "But you've gotta invest in who you are."

Full text:   Mahni Suyoso sits beaming in the passenger seat of a bright red pickup truck as it rolls slowly through the bustling streets of central Jakarta.
She's in a parade featuring jubilant brass bands and volunteers throwing out water and treats to the crowd, mostly local office workers. In the back of the truck is a 1.8-metre-tall pyramid of wired-together eggplants, carrots, snake beans, cabbages, tomatoes, corn and a pile of yellow rice - along with the national flag.
It's the celebration of a new Indonesia.
Ms. Mahni, an entrepreneur with eight restaurants, had the vegetables dug from her farm to showcase rural prosperity, and then piled into the vehicle with her employees to drive a day and a half across Java from the small city of Wonosobo. Indonesia was finally inaugurating a president they thought was worth honouring: Joko Widodo, known to all as Jokowi.
Ms. Mahni is elated, she explains, because Jokowi is a successful, hard-working business person from a small city, just like her - not part of the old Jakarta elite who have dominated politics since the fall of Suharto in 1998.
"I'm from the village, I don't have any education, but I know money," says Ms. Mahni, 42, as she secures a Jokowi headband around her turquoise head scarf.
"He became successful from business, not from corruption. Jokowi knows how to make us prosper."
Indonesia is experiencing a burst of unprecedented economic and political optimism. The world's fourth most populous country, with some 250 million people, is emerging as a powerhouse of Southeast Asia, at the dawn of an awakening that many compare to pre-boom China three decades ago.
After decades of dictatorship and corruption, the country is quickly shifting course with the election of a political outsider that many think will usher in a new era of sustainable economic growth.
Global companies, eager to get in on the ground floor, are racing to invest and sell consumer goods to Indonesia's rapidlygrowing middle class.
Ottawa-based billionaire investor Sir Terence Matthews compares Indonesia to China in the late 1980s. He just opened a Jakarta office for his investment firm Wesley Clover, which has extensive holdings in technology and real estate.
Sir Terence struck his first joint venture in Beijing in 1980. "I've been doing business in this region for well over 30 years and I generally avoided deals in Indonesia," he says in an interview.
But that has now changed. "Timing in life is almost everything - I don't care whether it's sex, a new market or a new product," Sir Terence says. "We think timing for Indonesia is good. The government feels the same way."
The country is still vulnerable to sudden capital outflows, and there are lingering concerns about the regulatory and legal framework. But with Jokowi as President, business people and foreign investors - as well as ordinary citizens - are hopeful his reformist government will build desperately-needed infrastructure, clamp down on corruption and liberate the country's vast potential.
Cameron Tough, a Canadian who works in investor relations for PT Adaro Energy, a major coal miner, says "Indonesia in the next 10 years will blow us all away."
Targeting corruption
Indonesia's economy, the biggest of the various Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) countries, has posted growth on average of about 5 per cent a year for a decade, and exports doubled to $204billion in the five years leading up to 2011.
The country has an abundance of natural resources, and boomed as China gobbled them up: It is the world's largest producer of thermal coal, tin and nickel. It has vast supplies of oil and gas, and is by far the biggest exporter of palm oil. Japanese investors seeking strong returns as their economy sputters at home have become the largest foreign investors in Indonesia - and their footprint is visible from bank towers and infrastructure projects to the Yamaha motorcycles zipping through Jakarta's gridlock.
But corruption has been a problem for years, bleeding away state revenues that could have been used to build infrastructure and pay for services. Indonesia's Corruption Eradication Commission has been making headway, and Jokowi even had his cabinet vetted; financial institutions were approached for financial records and several potential cabinet ministers were excluded. He's appointed technocrats to key economic portfolios. And most importantly, Jokowi has acted quickly since his inauguration on Oct. 20 to slash Indonesia's fuel subsidy - which, combined with other other subsidies, ate up one-fifth of the national budget in 2012, more than three times the spending on infrastructure. That will free up money to build roads and ports that will help growth.
"I remember my grandfather saying 'Watch Brazil,' " says Francisco Goncalves, a Canadian who heads PT McElhanney Indonesia, a mapping firm that works with clients such as mining giant Rio Tinto. "They were doing nothing. Then they woke up. I think it's the same thing with Indonesia. It has everything."
Many worried Jokowi would lose the election to Prabowo Subianto, a former army general under Suharto, who ruled the country for three decades. But with Jokowi in charge, a new approach to business is already visible. Chris Bendl, the chief executive officer of Manulife Indonesia, said two of his Indonesian executives were interviewed by the new President's transition team.
"That would never happen in the past," Mr. Bendl says. "The fact that they're listening to the business community is a positive sign."
Manulife, which has more than two million customers in the country, is getting a slice of the lucrative growing consumer class. Mr. Bendl says barriers to entry in Indonesia are high, but local partnerships can help foreign companies overcome the challenging logistics - and reach the people. Manulife, for example, partnered with a bank that had deliberately opened branches next to traditional Indonesian markets in order to give out small loans to the vendors. They now also sell them insurance.
"It's a distribution play, more than any other," Mr. Bendl says.
Although national income is still only $3,580 (U.S.) a person, it's on the rise. Consulting firm McKinsey estimates that Indonesia's middle class numbers about 45 million, an already large market for goods and services that could grow to more than 135 million people by 2030.
Boston Consulting Group estimates that number may be even higher, saying in 2013 that there is around 74 million Indonesians in families that spend $200 or more a month who are about to "ramp up" spending on everything from household items to financial services, creating a "critical window of opportunity" for consumer goods companies.
Regional discount airlines such as Lion Group and AirAsia have made record aircraft orders - one Lion Air order for 234 Airbus aircraft was $24-billion - as they struggle to keep up with rapid growth in Indonesia and its ASEAN neighbours.
Western brands, lured by millions of consumers with newly disposable income, are seeing strong growth in Indonesia. Unilever Indonesia has seen steady sales for its soaps and soups through a network of 500 distributors with hundreds of thousands of outlets. Best Western International, citing "an important period in the history of Indonesia," is expanding rapidly from just five hotels in Indonesia in 2013 to 31 by the end of 2015. And despite infrastructure challenges, corporations, from Japan's Honda and South Korea's LG to General Motors, have opened up factories here - helping turn the country into a manufacturing hub for Southeast Asia.
Infrastructure bottlenecks
On the way out of Jokowi's hometown of Solo, a mid-sized city in central Java, the main road begins winding past hundreds of tiny, wholesale furniture stores displaying newly made cabinets, ornately carved doors and dining room tables. Some of the shops have freshly hewn logs out front, or heaps of stacked rattan - hints of Indonesia's tropical climate and booming forestry sector.
After an hour, a side road veers over a bridge and onto a gravel road lined with bamboo. It is here, across from a field of freshly planted peanuts, that Jokowi started the furniture export business that led him to the presidency. On this afternoon, a truck has backed a 12metre Evergreen shipping container up to one of the warehouses. In the shade near some parked motorcycles, Sehadi, a 42-year-old machine operator who goes by one name like many Indonesians, explains that he was here at the beginning.
He briefly left Jokowi's firm for a better salary, but returned - not for more money, but because Jokowi was a good boss.
"He started very small. He started with a team of 10 staff.
He even drove an ugly car in the beginning" says Mr. Sehadi, drawing laughs from colleagues. "When Jokowi was here, it was very nice. He treated employees really well."
By the time Jokowi shocked his friends by running to become mayor of Solo, Jokowi's factory was dispatching about 80 containers a month to overseas markets, according to one local businessman. Jokowi, who travelled internationally to industry conferences in the U.S. and Europe, grew a profitable business in a country that the World Bank currently ranks at a dismal 114 in ease of doing business (out of 189 countries).
Boosting manufacturing is crucial if Indonesia wants to find decent-paying jobs for the roughly 16 million young graduates flooding the job market in the next six years, who will fail to find meaningful work if gross domestic product growth remains below 6 per cent, according to the Asian Development Bank.
"That's still below Indonesia's potential," says Edimon Ginting, the bank's deputy country director in Indonesia. "The solution is structural reform."
For a furniture maker in Solo, structural reform would involve removing the infrastructure bottlenecks that have choked expanding firms - particularly at the hundreds of ports that dot the shorelines of this massive, archipelagic nation.
Supriyadi, a friend of Jokowi's, owns a furniture exporter in Solo that directly employs 240 people, indirectly employs another 600 weavers and artisans, and pulls in about $2.5-million (U.S.) a year shipping rattan furniture to the U.S., Sweden, Mexico and Canada. As he strolls through his cavernous factory, past chairs destined for Pier One Imports, Supriyadi details his frustrations. Whether he's getting raw materials from the massive islands of Sumatra or Kalimantan, or shipping out finished products from Solo, the poor condition of Indonesia's ports is a constant irritant.
Smaller barges are often necessary for transfers to larger boats, resulting in extra costs and delays, he says. And because it's only possible to use seven-metre containers between Indonesia's thousands of smaller islands, it becomes prohibitively expensive to ship within Indonesia. It is often more expensive to ship goods from one Indonesian island to another than it is to ship from Indonesia to Singapore, China and even Rotterdam. This prevents Indonesian businesses from taking full advantage of their own domestic market.
For example, buying a sack of cement in the remote islands of eastern Indonesia can cost 10 times what it would cost on Java, where nearly 60 per cent of Indonesians live. In many smaller ports, goods are unloaded by hand. But even in Jakarta, it can take eight days before a waiting freighter can enter a major port, according to local consultant Paul Rowland.
Jokowi understands all this, Supriyadi says, and that's why he's optimistic. "Jokowi's going to fix the system," Supriyadi says.
Working-class support
On the banks of the river where Jokowi swam as a boy, more than a dozen children squat with fishing rods. His old neighbour, Sutarti, 62, strolls the narrow lanes of shacks that still make up this riverside shanty town. She recalls Jokowi as a simple boy from an average family, who played marbles and flew kites. She would occasionally take him to his uncle's place on the back of a bicycle she has since thrown out. "If I knew he was going to become president, I would have kept it," she laughs.
It is in working-class communities like this - first in Solo and then in Jakarta where he was elected governor - where Jokowi forged a key part of his appeal: What people here call blusukan - effectively, dropping in on poor communities to negotiate with residents. In later years, this also meant surprising civil servants to ensure accountability.
But he learned it under tutelage. When political neophyte Jokowi first ran as mayor of Solo, he partnered with veteran grassroots organizer F.X. Hadi Rudyatmo. Mr. Rudyatmo became Jokowi's deputy, but was also the businessman's mentor as he transitioned to politics.
"I introduced Jokowi to the people," says Mr. Rudyatmo, who became mayor of Solo when Jokowi moved on. "At the beginning of blusukan," he adds, "there were a lot of complaints [from Jokowi]. He was cold. He got sick."
But it worked. Though dismissed by some as a gimmick, blusukan got results. It earned Jokowi respect from communities - particularly among street vendors and other urban poor who needed to move for infrastructure projects - that helped power re-elections in both Solo and Jakarta.
After winning their first mayoral term with 36 per cent of the vote in Solo, they won a second term with more than 90 per cent after dozens of meetings allowed him to peacefully move street hawkers to a new trading area. Jokowi then moved on to Jakarta, where he scored numerous successes in the gridlocked capital. Jokowi introduced universal health care, issuing cards that empowered citizens to demand medical services.
In Jakarta, he eventually broke ground on a desperately-needed subway system. He negotiated land rights for a crucial ring road, where his predecessors also failed. Jokowi ventured into slums to relocate residents from a flood catchment area to north Jakarta, where he arranged for subsidized apartments, free TVs and fridges, as well as a sea bus route to take the residents - many of them maids and construction workers - back to their old neighbourhood jobs.
Sitting in front of a new apartment, Preyetno, a local village head, said residents originally didn't want to move, despite constant flooding. But Jokowi convinced them. "Everything was explained to the people in great detail," Preyetno says. "We even ate together" with Jokowi.
"We had a big feast. We all sat on the floor."
But can a president directly negotiate across an archipelago of more than 10,000 islands? In interviews across Solo and Jakarta, in working-class communities won over by Jokowi, people repeatedly expressed the unrealistic hope that Jokowi would still pop by to see them.
Mr. Sulistyo says that with technology, Jokowi can engage in "e-blusukan," but another on Jokowi's team, the pollster Saiful Mujani, laughs at the term.
" E-blusukan ? What is that?" asks Mr. Mujani, noting he worries about the public's huge expectations. "He's so busy and Indonesia's so big."
Even his former neighbour Ms. Sutarti, who says she still celebrates Ramadan with Jokowi's mother, has found her links to Jokowi severed, much to her disappointment. "It's very hard to meet Jokowi nowadays, but we still pray for Jokowi," she says.
Rising middle class
Despite misconceptions that Indonesia is a pure commodity play or overly reliant on manufacturing exports, McKinsey argues that the economy is driven largely by domestic consumption and services. In a recent survey, the Economist Intelligence Unit surveyed 171 business and discovered that cheap labour ranked 10th among reasons for manufacturing products in Southeast Asia.
The No. 1 reason was access to the rising middle class.
In addition to being a hot market for Manulife, for years Indonesia was also BlackBerry Ltd.'s most crucial emergingmarket bastion. "We had a pretty small team doing some pretty serious business," says Andy Cobham, who used to lead the firm's local operations.
Of course, the economy has slowed in recent quarters. Cooling Chinese demand has dampened prices for commodities, which make up more than half of Indonesia's exports. And the U.S. Federal Reserve's clawback of bond-buying stimulus led to huge capital outflows, which put pressure on the Indonesian currency. But a depressed currency, combined with expected infrastructure-building and Jokowi's desire for - and knowledge of - small and medium-sized business, could lead to expanding manufacturing and exporting.
This would improve incomes, boosting consumption and the economy.
Even an export ban on unprocessed minerals slapped in place by the previous government, which took effect in 2014 to the dismay of miners, could eventually help domestic manufacturing, balancing out an extractive sector that has been criticized by environmentalists.
Still, Indonesia has been a risky place. Mr. Cobham, who notes that the country remains a volatile place to invest, knows this better than most. In 2009, he was having a regular breakfast meeting when a suicide bomber walked into the JW Marriott hotel in Jakarta and detonated explosives. Mr. Cobham spent 10 weeks in the hospital.
"We were targeted," he said.
But even though he's cautious, he's still here. In fact, he was hired to lead the new Jakarta office of Sir Terence's Wesley Clover investment firm.
Virtuous circle of investment
Sitting in a wooden pavilion at his restaurant in Solo, Slamet Raharjo - who also owns a handicrafts company and founded an exporters' association with Jokowi - motions to the road. It used to be full of hawkers, he says, but Jokowi relocated the vendors and remodelled the street on Singapore's Orchard Road. The improved atmosphere convinced Mr. Raharjo to expand his restaurant, which serves chilled tamarindflavoured drinks and chicken satay on lemon grass stalks.
As Jokowi begins his promised overhaul of Indonesia's vast port system, Mr. Raharjo is so confident that he plans to open up a brand-new fisheries business.
But unlike with his other export-oriented business, he's planning to take advantage of Indonesia's vast domestic market. And he's just one of many with such plans: He says new ports would be the start of many new businesses, and mentions hoteliers he knows that are already planning to take new chances on more distant islands - like they once did with Solo when Jokowi was in charge, sparking a cultural and economic renaissance in the city. This creates a virtuous circle of investment that he sees spreading through the archipelago.
"There is a new hope among business people," he says, noting that the vote he cast for Jokowi this past summer was the first vote he's ever cast in a general election.
"Everything is changing."
INVESTING
How to bet on Indonesia's rise
Long viewed as a mineral-rich country with an eager buyer in nearby China, Indonesia's economy has shifted in recent years as more companies take advantage of the archipelago nation's booming middle class. Although the regulatory and legal regimes can be unpredictable, many foreign investors have faith in a newly elected administration - and its attention to anti-corruption initiatives - and are hoping that plans for desperately-needed infrastructure will proceed without delay. From expanding commercial real estate companies to the vast Telkom Indonesia - which has around 140-million mobile subscribers - there are number of ways for investors to gain exposure to the largest economy in ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations).

The house on Robinson Street is a black box. A finely crafted one, with wood-framed windows set off by dark-stained pine siding. Every detail has been considered, from the building's unusual sideways orientation to its doorbell, which is slotted precisely into a slab of Douglas fir.
Located near Queen and Bathurst, the home is exactly what many affluent Torontonians want today: well thought-out in its plan and construction, unapologetically contemporary in its design language. Yet new houses like this are so rare as to be almost non-existent in the Toronto market.
That is where the company Modernest, who developed and built the Robinson project, comes in.
Led by the local architects Kyra Clarkson and Christopher Glaisek, Modernest has completed four high-quality new houses, and are ready to deliver more as finished products. All featuring the same modernist vocabulary, they also share what Clarkson calls "a common language" of design details that are thoughtful but relatively affordable.
They are operating in a novel way, trying to bridge the divide between serious architecture and profitable development. "Our idea in forming Modernest," Clarkson explains, "was to use our knowledge about the zoning process, our knowledge about construction, and our care for detailing, and pull it all together. And we'd take the financial risk as well," she says with a small laugh. "It's a big commitment."
Their business model has shifted along the way - including one final surprise - but the Modernest project has led them to create some excellent houses, designed by Clarkson, that could set examples for other people's projects. This includes the one on Robinson. To build it, they bought a semi-detached one-storey cottage. They tore it down and wound up with an oddly shaped lot - shallow, wide and wedge-shaped, with a fire station right behind it. Their design savvy transformed the situation. Clarkson designed the house to run down one side of the lot, creating an expansive side courtyard. The main door and a patio entrance (all fitted with custom doors) face this way. A row of cedars obscures the messy yards next door, and a fence with horizontal slats, stained black like the house, separates the courtyard from the street. A few small, high windows bring in light from the south while keeping the fire station hidden.
Inside, the 1,500-square-foot building is compact and crisply detailed, reflecting Clarkson's experience designing under her own name and earlier for the highly esteemed New York firm of Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architects. (Glaisek has an influential day job as vice-president for planning and design at Waterfront Toronto.) The walls are drywall, the floor a relatively ordinary white oak hardwood, yet a few details elevate it above the ordinary. In the kitchen, which faces the street, there is a long narrow window in place of a kitchen backsplash. "This way, you can watch what's happening," Clarkson says. "It's interesting to see what's going on but to be a bit removed." The stair is elegantly wrapped by a wall of glass that runs floor to ceiling, a minimal touch that looks simple, but is not. After you rise to the second level, it is capped by a large skylight that perfectly matches the size of the stairwell, opening the small house up to the sky and the sunlight.
As I looked closer I saw subtler details, the kind that require some care in the design and are usually seen only in multimillion-dollar, custom houses. There are no bulkheads, for instance. The ceilings are high and flat, while ducts are concealed in the walls and ceilings. Electrical outlets are placed horizontally, slotted sideways into the baseboards so as not to interrupt the clear planes of the walls. You might not notice these at first, but they contribute to a sense of refinement in the spaces, which are also wellproportioned and planned for flexible use.
Clarkson argues that such refinement will serve well over time. "A house is not a disposable product," she argues. This is why the construction quality is also relatively high, including the use of insulated concrete forms for the foundation and in-floor radiant heating.
This is consistent with their other houses so far, which are built for construction budgets of between $250 and $300 per square foot. Their first gambit was a project near Leslieville: a three-bedroom, 1,250-square-foot house that they sold in early 2012 for $800,000. It was a modern refinement of a standard long-and-narrow Toronto house, and it set much of the design language for the next houses, including Robinson. "I think it's important to choose a few elements that are going to be unique, and everything else needs to be well thought through, but it can be really simple," Clarkson says. She cites the use of tall custom doors that reach all the way to the ceiling, surrounded by deep casings. These cost a slight premium, but the spatial effect is tremendous. It's a trick that good architects often use on high-end projects.
Do such choices pay a financial dividend? Certainly, there are easier ways to make a profit in housing. Clarkson says they just broke even on their first house; many potential buyers balked at its slightly out-of-theway location. However, they heard from many people who were interested in a Modernest house. And for their second project (near King and Bathurst) and the third on Robinson, they matched sites they'd found with clients who bought in before construction was finished. At Robinson, the buyers, a childless couple, asked for the house to be finished with two bedrooms upstairs rather than three.
In these cases, they are not exactly developers or architects working for clients in a traditional manner, but were filling a hybrid role. This, Clarkson suggests, may be their niche. "We see ourselves as providing a product that can be purchased with some input," she says, "like buying a car, where you can choose heated seats or a sunroof." On the other hand, Clarkson says, each house is "clearly site-specific, and rooted in a place."
It's exciting to see talented designers wading into the waters of building and development, and trying to take on a larger role in homebuilding. Too often Canadian architects are reluctant to think of themselves as business people. They seem to feel that if you worry too much about turning a profit or seeking clients, you must not be much of a designer. But that attitude shuts down potential opportunities and shortchanges the city, and potential clients.
Most small infill housing projects in Toronto are still woefully bad; renovating an old house in a contemporary manner is nearly as expensive as building new. There are people who would and could buy a good contemporary house if they could find it.
That includes, apparently, Glaisek and Clarkson's own family.
This month they are completing their fourth house, located just south of Bloor Street near Bathurst; it's the biggest Modernest so far: a very well-planned, 2,500 square feet, and they had intended to put it on the market. Instead, they decided over the holidays to move in with their children, and sell their current home on the Danforth. It will become a sort of showcase for Clarkson's practice and Modernest. "I really want to use this as an opportunity to be critical about our assumptions and about our design instincts," Clarkson said.
It's another black box. It may hold some answers - if not the definitive solution - to delivering first-rate housing to a broader swath of Torontonians.

By this time next week, Toronto's 17th Interior Design Show (IDS) will be in full swing at the Metro Convention Centre, sporting its usual panoply of product exhibits, talent showcases and talks by active players in the Canadian and international worlds of architecture and design.
One of the speakers scheduled to present his office's work next Friday is the American architect Marlon Blackwell. I, for one, was intrigued and a little surprised, pleasantly, to see his name on the list of headliners, given the self-conscious, frankly cosmopolitan ambitions of IDS.
Headquartered in Fayetteville, Ark., where he practises and heads the architecture department of the University of Arkansas, Mr. Blackwell is thought by some observers of the American scene to be merely a southern regionalist. It's a designation that is both unfair and untrue.
While he has certainly sunk deep creative roots in the rocky landscape and human culture of the Ozark mountains, his designs are nurtured (more now than ever) by the high modernist stream that descends from Le Corbusier, through Rem Koolhaas, into the contemporary moment. He likes to say his architecture is what happens when you marry Corb and a bullfrog.
When we spoke by phone last week, I asked Mr. Blackwell what he planned to tell his Toronto audience.
"I'm going to talk about what we do here in what we like to call the Ozarks outback - what we've been working on for the last 15 or 20 years: work that is stubbornly local, but is very much connected to a more universal language of architecture. It draws on the aspects of place, the vernacular, certain typologies, then represents them in a strangely familiar way."
Among his Arkansan sources are "barns and silos and dogtrot houses," but also "emerging vernaculars such as the semi-truck trailer, campers - parts of a more mobile, technological society. We're looking at everything from feed mills to chicken houses. Beautiful iconic structures that ... stand out from all the flotsam and jetsam that makes up most of the built environment. We are tapping into that, but in a hybrid way - mixing things up."
Porchdog House is a good recent example of how Marlon Blackwell "mixes things up."
This 1,500-square-foot, metalclad residential project, blockily monumental and formally tough, was designed as a model home in east Biloxi, Miss., a coastal town devastated by Hurricane Katrina. New federal rules stipulated that replacement housing built there must be raised at least twelve feet above the street to escape major storm surges coming off the Gulf of Mexico. So what about the porch? "How do you maintain the social interface in the South?" Mr. Blackwell asked.
"Which is the porch in an urban condition?" It was an important question, in view of the fact that the ground-level porch had been a standard feature of Biloxi houses and streetscapes forever. Mr.
Blackwell solved the problem simply by raising the boxy body of the house according to the regulations, and installing a broad porch in its shade - one big enough for any number of southern hounds to take an afternoon snooze, or for a family to gather in the cool of the evening and enjoy the casual streetside sociability that the southern porch has traditionally offered.
(Porchdog House was commissioned by a single dad with three children, and constructed for about $150 a square foot.)
Not just here, but also in his other work, porches matter to the architect. For example, he is designing a visitors' centre for an urban park in hot, humid Memphis that will be 8,000 square feet in area and cooled by fans, and that will be surrounded by an 8,000-square-foot porch. "We are looking at ways to expand indoor-outdoor relationships," Mr. Blackwell said. The centre is not to be "a crystalline box on the land. We're trying to develop liminal zones around the building - another thing that is born of the region. This might not be useful in a place like Minnesota, but in the South, it becomes quite useful."
There is something a bit ironic about Mr. Blackwell's appearance at next week's IDS, since the most memorable aspect of his projects is surely nothing to do with their interiors, but their exterior imagery. The architect likes to create idiosyncratic forms that cast strong shadows - shapes that are blunt, openhanded, and as honest about themselves as a good truck. His best images are those with the character of a face you don't easily forget.
"I used to be a cartoonist when I was a kid, all the way up through college," he explained.
"So all the buildings I do are developed in profile. I really think of buildings as visages. Increasingly, I'm trying to distill the form down to very iconic, legible figures. These figures aren't some kind of decorative, postmodern thing, quoting something. They become useful.
When you see the silhouette of a barn, you say, 'Ooof! That's powerful stuff!' It creates an emotional response. That's what we're striving for."

Abstract: The most coveted sites in urban areas might go quickly, but landlords in smaller markets will be struggling to find a retailer willing to jump into Target's massive footprint, with stores ranging from 80,000 to 125,000 square feet. "In the current market situation I would be surprised if there were many locations that would have numerous bidders," said Jeff Berkowitz of retail broker Aurora Realty Consultants Inc. "It's just not a time where you have that many players."

Full text:   Target Corp.'s surprise decision to shutter all of its Canadian stores and file for creditor protection will leave a massive footprint of vacant space in shopping centres across the country, and industry officials say there is no obvious suitor set to fill the void.
With nearly 15 million square feet of retail space and five million square feet of office and industrial warehouse space across Canada, the U.S. discount retailer's decision to shutter its Canadian operations less than two years after its bold entrance into the country has plunged the commercial real estate industry into uncertainty.
Some predicted that several stores may have to be demolished, others carved into several smaller locations and some, particularly in Western Canada, may struggle to find any tenants amid the turmoil of sinking oil prices.
The news came as a shock to most of Target's approximately 20 landlords, many of whom say they expected the company to close some underperforming stores, but expand others in key markets.
The company had only opened its new flagship store at Toronto's stockyards development in March and announced plans to build a new location in the city's downtown, one of seven new stores planned for Canada.
"I don't think any one of us suspected that it would be this way," said Rai Sahi, chairman and chief executive officer of Morguard Corp., a commercial landlord that had leased 15 locations to Target, representing 2 per cent of its total revenue.
"Every time something like this happens in the industry, it's a well-known fact that in the short term, there is negative impact, not only on the market but also on the mood," said Dori Segal, chairman of First Capital Realty, which leased two stores to Target.
Analysts and landlords speculated that potential local suitors include Wal-Mart and Canadian Tire, although in some cases those retailers already have existing stores close to Target locations and could either use the opportunity to move to a better space or use it as leverage to renegotiate better deals with their existing landlords, said Alex Arifuzzaman of retail consultant Interstratics Consultants Ltd. American home improvement retailer Lowes Companies Inc., which has been trying to expand in Canada since withdrawing its bid to acquire Rona Inc. in 2012, may also be interested in some Target locations. But few expected a single retailer, either Canadian or international, would be interested in taking over all 133 Target locations.
The most coveted sites in urban areas might go quickly, but landlords in smaller markets will be struggling to find a retailer willing to jump into Target's massive footprint, with stores ranging from 80,000 to 125,000 square feet. "In the current market situation I would be surprised if there were many locations that would have numerous bidders," said Jeff Berkowitz of retail broker Aurora Realty Consultants Inc. "It's just not a time where you have that many players."
As an anchor tenant in many malls, Target inherited leases from Zellers that already came with rents well below market prices, averaging $6 to $7 a square foot, compared to going rates close to $20. For some landlords, that may make it easier to negotiate a competitive deal with a major retailer willing to take over an entire location. Otherwise, landlords say they will have to carve them up into smaller stores.
Brian Kriter, senior managing director at retail broker Cushman Wakefield, predicted some locations may be demolished to make way for several small stores, which would be a cheaper alternative to leaving a store vacant for months to search for another major tenant and allow landlords to charge higher rents.
"I sense an opportunity to grow our revenues by putting in some smaller tenant and box stores," said Patrick Sullivan, chief operating officer of Primaris, a division of H&R REIT, which leased nine locations to Target.
Others worry whether Target's catastrophic demise in Canada is sending a message to retailers across the globe to avoid Canada like the plague. "What does this say to American or international retailers that have been considering a potential entry into Canada?" Mr. Berkowitz said. "Does this close the door for them completely on Canada as an expansion market because of the failure of Target to make a go of it? In the cautious climate that we're in right now, it is definitely going to have an impact."

Abstract: "Even if the Grace Islet problem is resolved - and I hope it is - it doesn't ensure these issues do not emerge elsewhere," he said. "You have to resolve the issues of how ancestral burial grounds are protected, or not, under the law in British Columbia." He is heading up a group of lawyers, archeologists and anthropologists who are calling on the province to update the law to reflect the cultural importance of these burial sites to First Nations communities.

Full text:   Construction of Barry Slawsky's retirement home on Grace Islet in the Gulf Islands stalled on Dec. 18, with the concrete foundation and walls in place. On Thursday, the province explained why: It has reached a tentative deal to buy his island in an 11th-hour bid to protect the ancient aboriginal cemetery that covers the property.
The multimillion-dollar deal, expected to be finalized in February, will see the land protected as a nature conservancy, jointly managed by the local First Nations who had threatened legal action to protect what they deemed to be a sacred site.
It is the 12th time since the 1970s that the province has purchased land to resolve a conflict over what the law deems to be of archeological value - sites that are regarded by First Nations as sacred burial grounds.
To try to avoid future conflicts - there are thousands of similar First Nations grave sites known in B.C. - the minister responsible, Steve Thomson, says he is now asking for a review of the province's heritage and archeological laws and policies.
"We will look at policy and implementation - that's something I'll be looking to get some further advice on," he said in an interview. "I think that's fair to ask."
Mr. Slawsky purchased Grace Islet in 1990, and at that time the site was known to have archeological importance. But when ancient human remains were later found, archeologists investigated and found 16 burial rock cairns that would trace back at least 500 years.
Under the province's Heritage Conservation Act, it is illegal to damage, desecrate or alter a burial place that has historical or archeological value. But Mr.
Slawsky was granted a provincial "site alteration" permit to build his retirement home after agreeing to construct it around and above the rock cairns.
The new deal, Mr. Thomson said, was put together with the Nature Conservancy of Canada, which acquires properties with strong ecological values. He said the site is ecologically valuable for its Garry oak plant communities and as part of the rare Coastal Douglas-fir ecosystem. That was a selling point to bring in the Nature Conservancy as a partner, but mostly this deal averts a conflict with First Nations over the protection of ancient graves.
Once the sale is complete, Mr. Thomson expects the local First Nations, who will be partners in managing the site, will want to scrub Grace Islet of all traces of Mr. Slawsky's construction.
The Cowichan Tribes drafted a civil claim asserting aboriginal title to the islet - an unusual case, if it proceeds, because land claims are normally limited to Crown land where title has not been extinguished.
William Seymour, chief of the Cowichan Tribes, is not ready to drop the case yet because there are other burial sites that remain unprotected from development.
"Once I am happy we have reached conciliation, then I will not proceed," he said in an interview.
However, Mr. Seymour said this settlement is important. "I have been smiling ear-to-ear," he said. "It is such a good feeling, we now have a chance to restore the burial grounds to as close as we can to before the machines were brought on."
He said the chiefs in the region are comfortable with having the title to the land transferred to the Nature Conservancy, but details, such as who will have access to the land, are still being worked out.
George Nicholas, a professor of archeology and director of Simon Fraser University's Intellectual Property Issues in Cultural Heritage project, welcomed the settlement but said Mr.
Thomson still needs to modernize the province's heritage laws.
"Even if the Grace Islet problem is resolved - and I hope it is - it doesn't ensure these issues do not emerge elsewhere," he said. "You have to resolve the issues of how ancestral burial grounds are protected, or not, under the law in British Columbia." He is heading up a group of lawyers, archeologists and anthropologists who are calling on the province to update the law to reflect the cultural importance of these burial sites to First Nations communities.
The province has not stated how much it will pay for the site, but Mr. Thomson confirmed it will be in the millions - the real-estate value of a private island in the Gulf Islands, plus Mr. Slawsky's construction costs, would not come with a small price tag.

Can downtown Halifax put wind in its sails?: Argyle Developments' Nova Centre, opening in 2017, is one of a growing number of projects to lure people to the city core

Abstract: "I think it's a difficult time" to be a developer right now, Mr. [Wolfgang Thiel] says. "The market is relatively slow right now. All the buildings we have are too old, which is why we started to redevelop the TD Centre two and a half years ago. To have a strong office market, you need strong tenants, and they don't want to be in old buildings."

Full text:   Joe Ramia is making a $500-million bet on Halifax's downtown.
It's called the Nova Centre, one of the biggest all-at-once development projects the East Coast has ever seen. Covering two city blocks, it's a million-square-foot, three-tower complex of offices, hotel rooms and condos sitting on top of a publicly funded convention centre.
For the Lebanese-born Mr. Ramia, the 58-year-old president of Argyle Developments Ltd., it's a chance to leave his imprint on the city he's lived in since 1966.
"We have a lifestyle that's second to none," he says. "If you want to know if a city is successful, you gauge it by its heart, which is the downtown."
The complex, to open in 2017, will breathe much-needed new life into the core. While downtown Halifax is undoubtedly historic, much of it is aging with little grace: Before the RBC Waterside Centre opened last year, the newest office towers were built in the heyday of Full House and Guns'n'Roses 25 years ago. Craving the best talent, potential firms have flocked to newer developments in Halifax's vast suburbs, leaving the city with a downtown office vacancy rate twice the national average.
The Nova Centre, whose south tower will be curved like the billowing sails that long powered local industry, is one of a growing number of bets on a downtown rebound. Mr. Ramia and his fellow developers are flooding the Haligonian skyline with the first new cranes in a generation to lure business into the core.
Naturally, there are risks: They're adding more space to an already-soft market. But in doing so, they're playing a crucial game of chicken with the landlords of the old, dark, creaky buildings that dot the downtown, goading them to revamp or rebuild to lure workers back to the core.
"When you have a building that's 50, 60 years old, it needs to be repurposed," Mr. Ramia says in his west-end Halifax office at the end of December, sitting a few feet from a scale model of the Nova Centre. "It needs to be either knocked down or be completely gutted and redone."
Halifax's office market boasts numbers that are hardly worth bragging about: commercial realestate services firm CBRE Group Inc. estimated in December that the downtown had a 13.7 per cent vacancy rate, or nearly 700,000 square feet.
Mostly, this is because businesses have fled to newer suburban buildings, including in nearby Bedford. But earlier last year, local real-estate counsellors Turner Drake & Partners Ltd. called the whole city "overwhelmed by supply," with a citywide Class-A office space vacancy rate of 14.2 per cent.
In spite of this, downtown developers are awash in optimism. A new shipbuilding contract is driving business interest in the city; there's a rising hope in offshore oil exploration; and international financial organizations, including hedge funds, are setting up offices in the city, which offers low rents and laid-back lifestyles.
Argyle Developments, whose Nova Centre will add 150,000 square feet of office space to the mix next to the city's infamous row of restaurants on Argyle Street, isn't the only developer who's seeing opportunity beyond the vacancy numbers. Armour Group Ltd., led by chief executive officer Scott Armour McCrea, opened the nine-storey, $25-million RBC Waterside Centre late last year - the first new Class-A office complex to open since the iconic Purdy's Wharf in 1990 - and says that it's more than 90 per cent occupied.
Much of the new development is about quality of space, Mr. McCrea says. While the city is rife with historic buildings, there are many built in the 1960s and '70s that grow less attractive by the day.
"There is a shift in user demand - older types of buildings will no longer be acceptable for new tenants who are truly focused on acquiring the best talent," Mr. McCrea says, then laughs: "Nobody asks me for dark, short, squat space."
That's a sentiment shared by Wolfgang Thiel, whose Thiel Group of Cos. owns a swath of the city's downtown and is in the midst of doubling is TD Centre Tower to 200,000 square feet. The developer also has plans for a 500,000-square-foot twin-tower development called 22nd Commerce Square at George and Hollis Streets.
"I think it's a difficult time" to be a developer right now, Mr. Thiel says. "The market is relatively slow right now. All the buildings we have are too old, which is why we started to redevelop the TD Centre two and a half years ago. To have a strong office market, you need strong tenants, and they don't want to be in old buildings."
Thiel Group took the Nova Scotia government to court last year arguing that the Nova Centre's developer got an "unfair advantage" over others in getting certain exemptions to municipal planning rules. Argyle, for instance, was allowed to begin building its lowest levels before a final construction permit was issued.
The case was shut down by the Nova Scotia Supreme Court in December, which Mr. Thiel, who hoped it would set a precedent of fairness for new developments, calls "a shame."
The Nova Centre has landed plenty of other criticism, too.
Argyle was able to buy a literal chunk of city street that runs through the planned development, for instance, which when finished will become a pedestrian walkway beneath the convention centre. And in November, Argyle announced a year-long delay for the complex to open - it's now set for January of 2017 - forcing the convention centre management, Trade Centre Ltd., to find other options for 17 scheduled events in 2016.
And the convention centre itself, more than doubling in floor space from its old location beneath the city's flagship hockey arena, comes at a premium of $164-million from all three levels of government in a province where tax dollars are spread thin.
In an interview, Trade Centre president Scott Ferguson said the public investment was necessary to get out of its small, dark, aging space to allow for more, and mulitiple, conventions.
"From a market perspective, we have to invest in areas where we can excel," Mr. Ferguson says.
"You need a vehicle to highlight your accomplishments and attract top investors and innovators to the city."
There are further concerns with the convention centre's public subsidy, which contractually forces Mr. Ramia to build the whole complex at once, rather than a tower at a time, regardless of market forces. He has not, for instance, announced any tenants, but says he's speaking with financial companies in London and New York.
This, Mr. McCrea says, could distort the office market, offsetting the calculations that landlords like he and Mr. Thiel have made to justify their own commercial developments.
"The only thing that would hurt the market is public bodies, who need to not put pressure for something to be built when there might not be demand," Mr. McCrea says.
But Mr. Ramia believes that, with the allure of Halifax, if you build it - and build it right - tenants will come.
"Once people saw the confidence going into this project from the government, as well as from a developer," Mr. Ramia says, "it sent a signal that downtown is going to be something exciting."

The DAWN of SOMETHING NEW: As Arctic communities undergo profound growth and change, artists and architects are responding in radical ways. They are creating enduring structures that actually reflect the ever-changing environmental and cultural context of the North

Full text:   Sandhornoya, a remote island in northern Norway, just above the Arctic Circle, has the kind of epic, sublime landscape that would have inspired Turner or Bierstadt. A white sand beach unfurls around an inky blue inlet, a black, jagged mountain knifes up through a scruff of green brush. The landscape is mystical on its own, but until September, 2015, it is even more fantastic. Along the shoreline, a stunning series of pavilions have been erected for SALT: the world's first, yearlong festival of Arctic art, architecture and culture.
Since it began last August, the event has swelled the island's population well beyond its normal 400, attracting visitors from as far as Australia. One woman travelled from Britain (by plane via Oslo, plus a boat ride) simply because she saw a photo of the festival in a magazine and decided she had to be there.
The festival was co-founded by Norwegian curator Helga-Marie Nordby. She's just one of a handful of creative thinkers from around the world (many of whom are Canadian) who are interested in the North. As the once remote Arctic and subarctic regions become more developed, and their sparse populations grow and urbanize, it's a timely place to be a designer. The changes are demanding a new expression, and artists and architects are responding with beautiful, enduring structures that reflect the diverse, ever-changing environmental and cultural context of the North - referencing its past and preparing it for an uncertain future.
"The Arctic is so vast," explains Nordby. "But so few people live there. So there is very little knowledge about it. People don't have their eyes on it." And because corporations and politicians are increasingly jockeying for control of the Arctic's vast, to-be-tapped natural resources (which are becoming more accessible with climate change), Nordby is concerned about what could happen unnoticed. Hence her festival - it's an attempt to bring eyes and awareness to the land.
After arriving, guests camp out in simple but elegant wooden structures on the shore - one of which was designed by a group of architecture students from Halifax's Dalhousie University. They congregate around three giant, triangular pavilions conceived by Finnish architect Sami Rintala. There's a concert hall, an art space and a 110-seat sauna. Each has a long, peakedroof shape, a shape inspired by fiskehjelle, racks that have been used by Norway's indigenous Sami nomads for thousands of years to dry freshly caught cod.
There's also a steel shed for showers and a restaurant. Each structure, on its own, is artful. As a collective, they make for a utopian, entirely charming Arctic town.
Although SALT will only remain on Sandhornoya for several more months, Nordby plans to tour it over the next few years to at least seven more countries, including Greenland, Ireland, Scotland and the United States.
Maybe it will make it to Canada (Nordby isn't sure yet). But regardless, we have our own thinkers turning their attention to the distinctive needs of our own North - building in a complex context to satisfy a sensitive environment, and a sensitive set of cultural conditions. Particularly, righting past wrongs where architects and planners simply imposed an alien modernity on the local Inuit and First Nations, ignoring their needs and interests.
Mason White and Lola Sheppard are architecture professors (at the University of Toronto and the University of Waterloo, respectively), and co-run Lateral Office, a design research studio that has a special focus on the North.
They co-curated Arctic Adaptations, an award-winning show exploring Northern design that was first shown at the prestigious Venice Biennale of Architecture, and have co-written a soon-bereleased book, Many Norths, about design possibilities in the Arctic.
"It's frightening to see how naive we all are," says White, when it comes to the North.
"People imagine National Geographic-style images of icebergs and pristine landscapes," adds Sheppard.
White points out that Iqaluit is one of the fastest-growing cities in Canada. Since it became Nunavut's capital in 1999, the population has more than doubled (because of a high birth rate and rural-urban migration). And it is projected to double again in the next two decades.
Part of the challenge, though, is building for a largely Inuit and First Nations culture. As of now, there are no degree-granting universities in Canada's North for architecture or urban-planning schools. So any construction is likely going to be initiated by a designer from the south. Which has historical baggage.
"Typically, people in Iqaluit have been told, 'Here's the plan,' without being consulted," says White. So now "There might be a fear of innovation. Because in the past, innovation may have done bad things.
"But there are other forms of innovation," says White, "that are based on collaboration and intelligent, informed knowledge-sharing." Ideas that instead of denying or excluding the local context and culture, celebrate and bring it in.
One of their design proposals, envisioned after extensive travel and consultation throughout the Arctic, is a series of beautifully articulated trading huts and food storage sheds, collectively called the Arctic Food Network. The buildings would be lashed together like snow sleds, and take advantage of snow-pack walls that insulate in the winter and melt for better ventilation in the summer. But they would be strategically placed to take advantage of a food distribution strategy that largely relies on snowmobiles to reallocate hunted meat between various communities.
Montreal-based architect Alain Fournier has been working professionally in the North since the early 1980s. He agrees with White that collaboration with local communities is the key to innovation.
"In the south, we are still quite steeped in the idea that the form of a building should follow the function," says Fournier, co-founder of FGMDA Architects. "In the North, it's important that the form express the culture of the community.
He points to a series of small, regional airports that he's designed in Nunavik, in northern Quebec, that he worked on with community members in each location to develop familiar themes and motifs.
One has a long, skinny structure, with slender framing like a kayak. Others reflect beluga whales, sleds, even native berries.
The structures are simple and understated, but their emotional connection to the people that use and live by them makes their presence powerful.
"We're at the cusp of something exciting," says Fournier, who think it's his responsibility to help local communities "be empowered to express their culture," and not propagate old, colonial ideals of imposing a southern way of life.
It's the decidedly unsouthern way of life that attracted architect Jack Kobayashi to move permanently from his hometown of Montreal to Whitehorse in the early 1990s. He came for a yearlong contract with the Yukon government right after he finished his masters of architecture at the University of Manitoba, and was captivated by the sense of possibilities.
"In a city in the south," says Kobayashi, "as an architect, I would likely be pigeonholed to a certain job. Stuck at my desk.
Here ... there is a lot of opportunity."
Like Iqaluit, the population of Whitehorse has grown quickly (it's increased by more than 50 per cent since 1991). That growth has not only allowed Kobayashi to co-found his own, successful architecture practice - Kobayashi + Zedda Architects, which won one of Canada's highest architecture honours, the Prix de Rome, in 2006 - but also start his own contracting business, 360° Design Build, which has developed over $13-million in residential and commercial real estate since 2002.
And his long-standing connection to the community - the fact that he actually lives there - has given him an advantage over the fly-in-fly-out architects who more typically build in the North.
Instead of merely perfunctory buildings, Kobayashi designs sensitively for the location.
Even though the climate is challenging to build in, he's conscientious about sustainability. A health centre he did in Atlin Lake, for example, entirely relies on geothermal heat (replacing over 1,000,000 litres of diesel per year that facility would have needed).
Or his John Tizya Visitor Reception Centre, in Old Crow, Yukon, an area inaccessible by road. He designed it so that all the materials for the 5,000-square-foot facility would fit on a single, carefully packed cargo plane (which saved on construction costs - which tend to be astronomical). And he designed a heating system largely free of fossil fuels. It's hung with solar panels, which help in the sun-soaked summers.
Like Fournier's work, as well as the SALT pavilions, Kobayashi's buildings are simple and understated. But they are undeniably rooted in their surroundings, and were clearly conceived with affection for the people and landscape they serve. They also set a hopeful example for future designers turning their attention to open expanses of the North. That they can make the sublime landscape beam brighter with a strong pride in the place.

In quest for profit, Manulife looks beyond insurance

Abstract: We're on the crest of the wave that's happening in U.S. real estate - there's just such a large amount of capital seeking to be placed in the marketplace," said Ted Willcocks, global head of asset management of the company's real estate business. He expects to complete about two more large deals like Allianz in 2015. As Manulife's offices in Asia begin to request adding real estate to their investments, Mr.

Full text:   Skyscrapers, macadamia nuts and acres of pine trees may not be the first things that come to mind when Manulife Financial Corp. is mentioned, but the Canadian insurer profited from global investments in all three last year.
While Manulife's most visible business is selling insurance policies and retirement saving plans to consumers, one of its lesserknown business lines planted millions of trees in 2014. Another group produced thousands of barrels of oil and natural gas liquids in Western Canada, and a third business leased farmland across the southern United States to grow corn, soybeans and cotton.
Alternative assets in sectors such as real estate, agriculture and farmland have become increasingly important to Manulife as it deepens its focus on wealth and asset management, and aims to attract more institutional investors. These business lines have become more enticing to insurers in the wake of the financial crisis because they require less capital to run, and they have the potential to grow faster given aging demographics and international demand.
Manulife's decades of experience managing non-traditional asset classes are one way the company can set itself apart from competitors at a time when many yield-hungry fund managers are looking to alternative investments as a way to combat persistent low interest rates and equity-market volatility. Manulife wants to attract more institutions-from smaller funds to experienced investment companies- to invest beyond stocks and bonds alongside it.
Manulife Asset Management, the global business that manages investments for its parent company's wealth and retirement products as well as other institutional players, now oversees about $309-billion in assets, with $266-billion managed for external clients.
But it's the private markets group within the asset manager that has been a major focus in recent months. It launched in late 2013 in an effort to lure new institutional investment in three target areas: commercial real estate equity, commercial mortgage lending and private placements. This new group built on Manulife's Hancock Natural Resource Group, a trio of farmland, timber and renewable energy investments, as well as private equity and oil and gas investment arms. From forests to farmland and beyond, Manulife Asset Management Private Markets now oversees more than $75-billion in assets.
Only $14-billion of that was managed for external clients as of June this year, and Manulife has said it will take years to build the business, but the effort is gathering momentum. In December, the private markets group forged a $1-billion partnership with German insurance and asset management giant Allianz to invest in U.S. real estate. While Allianz will be putting up the majority of the capital, Manulife will manage the two office buildings in Chicago and Washington.
Real estate has been a staple long-term investment for Manulife for decades as a way to support the long-term liabilities of insurance policies. By bringing in other investors as partners, Manulife can also collect fees, building up a consistent revenue business.
"We're on the crest of the wave that's happening in U.S. real estate - there's just such a large amount of capital seeking to be placed in the marketplace," said Ted Willcocks, global head of asset management of the company's real estate business. He expects to complete about two more large deals like Allianz in 2015. As Manulife's offices in Asia begin to request adding real estate to their investments, Mr. Willcocks said China and Indonesia would be regions to expand to in the future.
But while there may be a demand for investment partnerships, finding a deal for soughtafter North American office properties at the right price is a challenge, Mr. Willcocks said.
"Certainly in California, and L.A. and San Francisco in particular, it's very difficult to get reasonable real returns given the high pricing expectations."
While he's cooking up the next real estate opportunity, Mr. Willcocks says he benefits from describing the other asset classes offered by the private markets group to potential investors, showing them that Manulife brings something different to the table.
Three of those other asset classes are run by Dan Christensen, chief executive of Hancock Natural Resource Group, which ended 2014 with about $14-billion (U.S.) in timberland, agriculture and renewable energy assets managed for Manulife's general account and institutional investors.
That makes the group four times as large as when timberland industry veteran Mr. Christensen came in to lead the group a decade ago. "I'm an old forester," he says, laughing. "I've been in the industry for 40 years so you can't keep me out of the woods."
The company's Boston-based Hancock Timber Resource Group was formed in 1985 and now manages more than six million acres of trees and accounts for nearly $12-billion of the group's assets. That makes it the largest manager of timberland for public and corporate pension plans and other institutional investors in the world, with assets as far away as New Zealand.
The time that elapses between planting a seedling and harvesting a mature tree can be anywhere from seven to 45 years, depending on the geography and tree type. And to determine whether a project is viable, the soil, rain and land must all be assessed, as well as the countries' politics. All this analysis and waiting requires sophisticated, patient investors, Mr. Christensen said.
In 2014, the timber group made its first investment in Chile through a joint venture, which along with holdings in Brazil could pave the way for even more deals in South America.
As the trees grow, the Hancock Agricultural Investment Group has also built up a portfolio of more than $2-billion in farmland assets. There are about 20 crops grown under its banner, from row crops like corn and soy planted each year, to permanent crops such as vineyards of grapes.
Much like investing in the stock market, crops perform better or worse depending on market conditions. "For every crop there's an investment thesis.
We're constantly re-evaluating that thesis and where that sits in the local and global markets, taking into account weather, yield, demand and other factors," Mr. Christensen said. A free-trade agreement signed between China and Australia is one example of how politics can affect returns. The deal would lift the 24-per-cent tariff on macadamia imports from Australia to its largest buyer within five years at a time when consumption of the nuts is growing in Asia. Manulife has nine macadamia farms in the region.
That volatility makes diversification of the crops essential - conditions for growing and selling almonds are not correlated at all to apples, for example.
"It's really the only free lunch we have, to spread our risk," Mr. Christensen said.
The newest business to come under John Hancock's banner is its renewable energy group, which invests in biomass energy projects in North America. Biomass is a material made up of plant fibre, such as the kind produced by timber and agriculture farms. The fibre can be used to make electricity, Mr. Christensen said. Plus, it's a revenue stream for waste. "We need to get that fibre off the land so we can grow our big valuable trees," he said.
In December, the Hancock Natural Resource Group signed a joint venture with Enviva Holdings LP to invest $320-million in a project to create a wood-based pellet, with all the water removed, that can be used as a substitute for coal. The product will be shipped to Europe to make electricity.
Developments like these are the cherry on top for Mr. Christensen. "These are really fun assets to deal with because whether it's trees or farm products, we're growing things that benefit society," he says. "Look at our trees! They're taking carbon dioxide out and putting oxygen into the air, what better asset class can you have?"

Full text:   Assessed values for single-family detached homes surged last year in Vancouver, where most of British Columbia's 100 most expensive properties are located.
A typical detached home on Vancouver's west side on a 15.24metre-wide lot had an assessment of $1,812,000 on July 1 last year, up 12.5 per cent from the previous evaluation on July 1, 2013. A representative detached property on the west side on a 10-metre-wide lot saw its yearover-year valuation climb 7.5 per cent to $1,575,000, according to new data released Friday by BC Assessment.
On the city's east side, a typical detached home had an assessed value of $993,000 last July, up 11.3 per cent over a 12-month period, said BC Assessment, the provincial Crown corporation that estimates values on behalf of B.C. municipalities, which in turn use the data to determine tax rolls.
The average price in the latest assessment roll for single-family detached properties increased 11 per cent year-over-year in the City of Vancouver, said Dharmesh Sisodraker, deputy assessor for the Vancouver Sea to Sky region.
Lululemon Athletica Inc. founder Chip Wilson has the most expensive residential property in the new provincial list compiled by BC Assessment. His Vancouver waterfront mansion rang in at $57.6-million, up 6.3 per cent from the previous evaluation.
A unique property, a private island, has emerged as the runner-up with an assessment of $51.6-million, up 10 per cent from before. The James Island property, spread across 316 hectares, belongs to U.S. billionaire Craig McCaw. The sprawling acreage in the Gulf Islands has been listed for sale by Sotheby's International Realty Canada since 2012 for $75-million. "It had a split classification before as residential and recreational, but it is all residential now," said Reuben Danakody, assessor in the Capital Region at BC Assessment.
Of the top 100 most expensive B.C. residential assessments, 95 are in either the City of Vancouver or University Endowment Lands or the district municipality of West Vancouver.
A Vancouver property registered to Pisonii (PTC) Ltd. is in third place at $50.1-million, up 8.9 per cent. The fourth spot belongs to the $31.5-million Vancouver residence of philanthropist Nezhat Khosrowshahi and her husband, Future Shop founder Hassan Khosrowshahi. Their property's value has climbed 9.9 per cent.
Fifth is the $28.1-million property owned by real estate developer Joseph Segal and his wife, Rosalie, a philanthropist. Their Vancouver home's value rose 10 per cent.
Homeowners will be receiving their assessment notices next week, reflecting market values from last July.
A representative detached house on West Vancouver's waterfront increased 3.8 per cent in value to $3,542,000.
While Vancouver and West Vancouver stand out with high-end homes, the sharpest percentage price gains have been in northwestern British Columbia. In the district of Kitimat, for instance, average assessed values for single-family detached properties soared 39.2 per cent to $316,000.
Rio Tinto Alcan's massive modernization project at its aluminum smelter site in Kitimat and some preliminary work on proposed liquefied natural gas projects have fuelled the local housing market. Kitimat's assessed values increased 26.7 per cent in the previous annual review.
Average assessed values jumped 29.9 per cent to $317,000 in Terrace and they rose 16.8 per cent to $229,000 in Prince Rupert, according to data for assessments for last July.
By contrast, the Capital Region's housing prices have been flat, with most properties seeing their assessments change in a range from slipping 2 per cent to rising 3 per cent. A typical detached home in Victoria had an assessed value of $536,000, up 1.9 per cent.

Last call for classic Cuba: Why just sit on a beach? Immerse yourself in the culture and see more of the Caribbean's largest island by sailing around it

Author: Wickens, Stephen

Abstract: Santiago, Cuba's No. 2 city, which feels like a cross of southern Europe and New Orleans. It's the birthplace of Afro-Cuban culture, [Raul Castro]'s revolution and Bacardi rum, and also home to San Juan Hill, where Teddy Roosevelt's Rough Riders helped finish off a war against the Spanish in 1898, starting what's considered a 60year U.S. occupation.

Full text:   Addendum: A Tuesday Travel story on Cuba incorrectly said the price for Cuba Cruise included taxes and fees. It did not. In addition, Variety Cruises' packages start at $2,790, not $652 as published.
At Plaza de la Revolucion the tourist waits, peers up the road, lowers the camera and waits some more.
He wants a classic American car for his shot of the monument to Jose Marti, a 19th-century poet, freedom fighter and all-round Cuban hero. But for what seems like ages, we see only Hyundais, Geelys and sputtering Ladas.
"Yanqui tanks" still abound, many serving as gleaming cabs in tourist areas. But locals say half the fleet has been scrapped or cannibalized for parts since the Soviet empire collapsed; newer imports are easier to maintain.
It's just one indicator of how rapidly things have changed since Raul Castro replaced brother Fidel in 2008. Cubans with means or overseas relatives can buy and sell real estate as well as cars. Half a million people run their own businesses, triple the 2011 total.
Now, with the United States preparing to normalize relations and end a decades-long embargo, the trickle of visiting Americans could become a torrent some time in the not-too-distant future.
So if you want to see one of socialism's last outposts, act now - and consider doing so on a cruise.
Yes, even the cruise industry, which Fidel despised, has a beachhead. Though big U.S.owned ships remain banned, Calgary-based Cuba Cruise launched weekly circumnavigations of the island last winter with the 162metre, 1,200-passenger Louis Cristal. It targets Canadians with, among other things, its Alberta Prime Steakhouse and familiar beers. The crew is multicultural and the on-board variety troupe combines Montreal-based Cirque Fantastique with Cuban entertainers assembled by the National Theatre director.
Greece-based Variety Cruises took last winter off to arrange new food and land-tour suppliers, and renovate the Pan Orama - a 54-metre, 50-passenger yacht.
Much more intimate than Cuba Cruise, it resumed its week-long trips between Havana and Cienfuegos on Nov. 29.
All-inclusive resorts have their place, but can't deliver the complete Cuba, which is the Caribbean's largest and most diverse country (nearly as big as our three Maritime provinces, more populous than the four Western ones combined). Cuba is more than sun and sand: It has a rich history (150 years of battles for independence from Spain, the United States and Russia) and regional cultures, some stuck in a horse-drawn time warp.
Cruises that tour the island naturally let you experience more of it - and provide entry to places where tourists are still a novelty.
Take one of the stops I experienced on Cuba Cruise last winter: After mooring at a long-abandoned pier in Antilla last January, we were greeted by waving, cheering locals. Turns out the arrival of the ship was such a novelty the mayor had declared a civic holiday for its first visit the previous month.
It was just one memorable moment from a couple of weeklong cruises I enjoyed during the past two winters. Other highlights include:
Cienfuegos, a south-coast town where Soviet-era factories blend with ornate French and Spanish architecture. It is lively and fun to explore on foot; don't miss Teatro Tomas Terry, a lovely concert hall built in the 1880s on the town square.
A side trip from Cienfuegos (offered by both cruises) to Trinidad de Cuba, a town founded on sugar processing which is celebrating its 500th anniversary this winter. It's a hot spot for musicians and dancers.
Santiago, Cuba's No. 2 city, which feels like a cross of southern Europe and New Orleans. It's the birthplace of Afro-Cuban culture, Castro's revolution and Bacardi rum, and also home to San Juan Hill, where Teddy Roosevelt's Rough Riders helped finish off a war against the Spanish in 1898, starting what's considered a 60year U.S. occupation.
Castillo San Pedro de la Roca del Morro, the Caribbean's most impressive fort. UNESCO calls this fortress, which has guarded Santiago's harbour for more than 300 years, the best Spanish military architecture in the Americas.
Punta Frances, which is on my top-five beaches list. It's beautiful, remote and unspoiled, and if I had to bet, I'd say it's the beach most likely to get wrecked next.
Cuba obviously needs change.
Few things highlight socialist dysfunction better than engineers and professors cleaning resort rooms because that's where the money is made. The country proudly trains doctors for the world - many of its physicians played major roles in the Ebola fight - but having clean washrooms back home seems not to be a priority.
"Cuba will retain its independent streak no matter how much it reopens to Americans," former U.S. presidential adviser and Time correspondent Nathaniel Lande, told me over drinks on the Pan Orama's aft deck. Lande, whose dad was Hemingway's doctor, first visited Cuba as a boy in the 1940s.
But he thinks Canadians should explore while they still have special status as the biggest source of Cuban tourism.
"Tell people to get to Cuba fast, before us Americans wreck it," he says - only partly in jest.
The writer was a guest of Cuba Cruise and Variety Cruises. They did not review or approve this article.
IF YOU GO
Booking Cuba Cruise's cruiseonly package starts at $652 per person. Air-land-cruise packages start at $852 per person.
Both prices include fees and taxes. Check for specials through yourcubacruise.com or a travel agent.
Variety Cruises' packages start at $652 (cruise only, taxes and fees not included) in January. (see glpworldwide.com).
Wholesaler GLP handles both cruises and can refer you to an agent in your area.
DEPARTURE POINTS
Both use Havana, but on Fridays Cuba Cruise stops into Montego Bay, Jamaica, for fuel, provisions and passengers. Flights to Jamaica are often cheaper than to Havana. Every other Variety Cruise starts in Cienfuegos.
MONEY
Cuba Cruise uses Canadian dollars; Variety's main currency is the euro. On land, you need convertible unit pesos (CUCs).
Exchange booths are easy to find, and for now you're still smarter buying in loonies than with U.S. dollars. Few Cubans even accept greenbacks.
HEALTH
You need proof of travel health insurance for Cuba. Even if your credit card provides it, get a confirmation letter.
When exploring on shore, take hand sanitizer and paper to washrooms.
If you're prone to seasickness, consider packing nausea pills or patches.

Do job-creation subsidies create jobs?: The worth of government spending in the competition to lure and retain employers isn't gauged as well as it can be, economists say

Full text:   On a Friday morning in December, 2013, Kathleen Wynne arrived at Cisco Canada's Bay Street offices with an early Christmas gift.
The Ontario government would give the technology giant $220million. In exchange, Cisco - which posted $7.9-billion in profits last year - would hire up to 1,700 more people in the province.
"My vision for Ontario is that it's a place where government makes smart, forward-looking investments," the beaming Premier told assembled reporters.
"This is the largest job-creating investment that we've seen in our technology sector."
The province is betting heavily on such corporate subsidies as it struggles to rev up a sluggish economy and win a global competition to attract capital. Every year, it doles out hundreds of millions to everyone from auto manufacturers to craft brewers.
In the coming days, the government will unveil details of the new Jobs and Prosperity Fund, rolling all existing corporate handouts into one $2.5-billion program.
But economists warn it is not clear the province does the rigorous analysis necessary to see if those subsidies are working.
What is more, one internal government report suggests neither officials nor companies receiving the money know if the handouts actually create jobs.
It all raises tough questions about whether corporate subsidies help the economy at all or are simply a waste of tax dollars.
The system
Some Ontario subsidies are big, one-off deals: $120-million to software company Open Text; $87-million to Honda. Others are more systemic, handed out through the Eastern Ontario and Southwest Ontario regional development funds. These include everything from $1-million for Montebello Packaging in Hawkesbury to $122,630 for Railway City Brewing in St. Thomas.
Each deal sets targets for the number of people a company must hire, and the amount of money it will spend. If the company does not meet those targets, the government can take back its cash. To measure the economic spinoff, the province uses Statistics Canada's InterProvincial Input-Output Model, which shows the effects of the cash infusion on the economy.
Experts say this is not enough. For one, it does not show whether the jobs Ontario pays companies to create are really new or if they displace jobs that would have been created without the subsidy. Consider the Cisco deal. Most of the jobs will be in Ottawa's information and communications technology industry, where the unemployment rate is just 3 per cent. Western University economist Mike Moffatt says that rather than creating new jobs, Cisco will be hiring people who otherwise would have worked for other high-tech firms.
"They automatically assume the people that get hired wouldn't have had jobs otherwise," he says.
The province should also factor in opportunity cost - whether those dollars would provide a greater economic boost if spent on, say, building roads or schools instead of subsidies.
"Even if there is a net benefit to a subsidy, you've then got to say, 'Okay, is there another use for that money that gives an even higher net benefit?" University of Ottawa economist Leslie Shiell says.
At the very least, he contends, government must weigh the benefit of a subsidy against the economic drag of the taxes that pay for it.
If the government considers these things, it is hard to know.
The province does not disclose full details of its economic modelling for individual deals, saying the information is "commercially sensitive."
That said, there is evidence some subsidies work.
A 2004 study by economists at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology looked at 82 counties in the United States that subsidized new factories. The counties had a 1.5-per-cent bump in wages and a hike in real estate prices of between 1.1 and 1.7 per cent compared with counties that tried to attract the same factories but lost out.
An analysis Mr. Shiell co-wrote concluded Canada's 2009 bailout of the auto sector was warranted because the economic cost of Chrysler and GM leaving the country would have been greater than the cost of shoring them up. The study calculated that allowing them to leave would have taken $230-billion out of the country's gross domestic product by 2025, many times the $14.4-billion the federal and Ontario governments paid for the bailout. Part of the reason for this is that manufacturing has a high productivity level. So even if all those auto jobs had been replaced by, say, service industry work, there likely would still have been a permanent cut to GDP.
Most importantly, such studies show there are ways to model corporate subsidy deals to decide which are worth it and which are not.
"If all it cost us was five cents to have these companies in Canada, we would do it," Mr. Schiell says. "So there's got to be some value in between five cents and infinity that is the turning point at which subsidizing becomes a bad idea."
The politics
With a high-voltage smile and gregarious personality, Brad Duguid is a consummate salesman. And with jurisdictions around the world opening their treasuries to lure corporations, Ontario's Economic Development Minister says he sometimes has to sweeten the pot to sell firms on his province.
"It's about competition - you're either in the game or you're not," he says in an interview at his office near Queen's Park. "All jurisdictions that are courting investment aggressively are offering some form of incentive."
Mr. Duguid says he turns down more subsidy applications than he approves. This past fall, for instance, the province allowed Ford to walk away from negotiations on a small engine plant in Windsor after determining the auto maker's requests for government cash were too large compared with the benefit of the plant.
But the province's concern for the economic complexities of subsidies appears to go only so far. Asked about the criticisms of the Cisco deal, Mr. Duguid goes back to his original point.
"The jobs were going to go somewhere in the world. We wanted them here," he replies.
How does he know those jobs would not have been created anyway by another company?
"I think that's a pretty optimistic view."
A KPMG audit commissioned by the province last year found the government is good at tracking individual figures, such as how much money companies spend and how many people they hire. But that same audit suggests the province does not actually know how much subsidies contribute to the economy.
KPMG, which interviewed civil servants and corporations that received money under the regional development programs, wrote that many of these people could not say how much the subsidies are attracting business investment and creating jobs - or if those things would simply happen on their own.
"It was difficult for most interviewees to definitively determine the impact of the funds on job creation, investment attraction and innovation separate from the effects of other business activities and market issues," the report says.
Ontario is far from alone in navigating these tensions.
Former Nova Scotia premier Darrell Dexter - who famously gave $304-million in forgivable loans to bring an Irving shipbuilding contract to Halifax - characterizes subsidies as a necessary evil. Running a small province with declining industries and stiff competition from nearby Quebec, he suggests there was not much choice.
"I don't know any political people who, given their druthers, would like to give subsidies.
Most would prefer that companies did business in their province for other reasons: a good work force, centres of excellence, natural-resource availability," he says. "But those things are available in a lot of different places."
Alberta has also used the practice. In 2011, the government struck a deal to help North West Upgrading build a facility near Edmonton. The province agreed to pay a fee to turn government owned bitumen into diesel. Two years later, the government also provided the project with a $300-million loan.
Then-cabinet minister Ted Morton says he fought the deal behind the scenes. If a project is really viable, he contends, the private sector can make it work without government help. But there was pressure from the public and opposition parties to upgrade more oil in Alberta rather than shipping it to foreign refineries. Mr. Morton says those political considerations trumped his economic arguments.
"If it takes more than a page to explain something, it's not likely to be a political winner," he says.
"That's true not only in elections, but even inside caucus and cabinet."
The way forward
Economists point to several solutions.
One is to construct a more thorough economic model by which all proposed subsidy deals must be tested - perhaps as part of the new Jobs and Prosperity Fund. Such a model would determine whether a subsidy creates new jobs or displaces others that would have been created anyway.
It would also account for such variables as different productivity levels of different types of work, and the effects of taxes needed to finance the subsidy.
Another option is for government to focus on larger programs that help all companies rather than giving cash to a select few. This could include building infrastructure, or providing more business advisory services on everything from marketing to management.
"You provide a subsidy to a local industry or community association and that association runs seminars and peer-to-peer networks for firms in their community," University of Toronto economist David Wolfe says.
"There is a whole continuum of things government can do."
Mr. Shiell suggests a third possibility, albeit one a little longerterm: Get every jurisdiction in North America, perhaps as part of a trade treaty, to agree to stop handing out corporate subsidies.
"Would we not be better to have a standstill treaty with other jurisdictions, and firms will locate based on economic fundamentals?" he says. "That's money that could be used for health care; it could be used for education. I really question whether spending it on businesses is the right way to go."

Full text:   For those who want to find out what détente with Cuba means to the U.S., one could consult with the Council on Foreign Relations, visit Miami's Little Havana, or easier, just tune into Rush Limbaugh.
"What's the practical meaning of this?" wondered the talk radio host (and smoker) after U.S. President Barack Obama's surprise announcement Wednesday. "It means you can get Cuban cigars now."
While the embargo hasn't yet been lifted on Cuban cigars, it already has given them a halo effect. "This development clearly heralds a new era for the cigar market mainly in the U.S. with the eventual lifting of the [U.S. trade] embargo," said Hans-Kristian Hoejsgaard, chief executive of high-end tobacco maker Oettinger Davidoff, in an e-mailed statement.
The thinking is that, like caviar, cigars represent something scarce, sexy, forbidden. But some industry experts warn that lifting the embargo will not ignite the U.S tobacco market.
There will be no next generation of stogie-chomping Schwarzeneggers.
Even if there is a spike in supply - itself a question mark - chances are there will be a quick inhalation followed by a yawn. "I would question if there is underlying demand," said Euromonitor's senior tobacco analyst, Simon Evans. "I see people buying them for the novelty but them not sustaining interest."
As it stands, U.S. consumption is slowly flickering out: 10 per cent from 2009 to 2013, according to Euromonitor. In part, that was due to the effect of the financial crisis on bankers and executives.
Widening health concerns have also contributed, said Mr. Evans, and the fact that there are fewer public venues for plutocrats and pretenders to puff away. Mr. Evans also observes that the resourceful few who want Cubans have already managed to get around the embargo. As it stands, the few Americans who travel to Cuba can import up to $100 (U.S.) in tobacco products.
What's more, the American palate may not care. Mr. Evans and others add Americans don't typically enjoy sucking back the strong, rich tastes of Cohibas or Montecristos that are unique to the local soil. They prefer the mellower flavours from elsewhere. "Think bland - mayonnaise and white bread," said Giuseppe Diluciano, who helps runs Thomas Hinds Tobacconist in Toronto's upscale Yorkville neighbourhood. "They want a Beaujolais when they could be having a Bordeaux that just explodes."
For Americans, the mystique around the Cuban cigar precedes the prodigious puffing of Fidel Castro and his nemesis John F.
Kennedy, who in 1962 asked his press secretary, Pierre Salinger, to hoard at least 1,000 H. Upmann Petit Coronas before his administration's landmark trade embargo on the repressive, communist island.
"There is a romance to them that we associate with the legacy of Hemingway, the era of the Copacabana and [former dictator Fulgencio] Batista," said Michael LaTour, a visiting professor at Cornell University who will be a professor of marketing at Ithaca College next year.
The trend for hand-rolled cigars took off in the 1990s as part a move toward living large. "The demand for high-end autos, food and golf equipment," said Mr. LaTour, co-writer of a paper entitled "Is a Cigar Just a Cigar? A Glimpse of the New-Age Cigar Consumer."
"All the stuff that intertwines with the experiential environment," he added. It was, after all, the decade that launched the magazine Cigar Aficionado and real estate rashes of McMansions.
Sales of handmade cigars comprised 10 per cent of total cigar retail volume sales in 2013 and 49 per cent of total cigar retail value sales, according to Euromonitor.
Instead, machine-made cigars dominate.
Even if Cuban cigars become an integral part of the American Dream, there is some doubt in the industry whether they will even arrive on U.S. shores. Last month, Imperial Tobacco CEO Alison Cooper, whose company helps produce brands such as such Montecristo and Cohiba, warned about a poor leaf harvest.
Equally important is the way they are made. Tobacco leaves take months to cultivate, and hand-rolling is an artisanal craft, one which requires training and experience. Changes won't happen overnight. Furthermore, industry experts say that catering to the lighter American tastes would require a somewhat significant shift in resources.
If the Cubans chose to, that is.
Despite the warming of relations, one can't forget the thick residue of resentment between the two countries. Cubans may decide it's not worth overhauling their system to meet the whims of the Yanqui consumer. "Knowing a few things about the Cubans, I'd say they'll want to do it on their own terms, like the Québécois," said Mr. Diluciano of Thomas Hinds. "Maîtres chez nous."

Full text:   The executive director for the Coalition of Progressive Electors has resigned over the mishandling of campaign contributions during Vancouver's recent civic election.
Sarah Beuhler said Wednesday morning she is taking responsibility "for a serious mistake" and is resigning effective immediately.
Ms. Beuhler said the hectic campaign environment, in addition to an overworked and understaffed party, contributed to her failing to report a total of $12,500 in donations from commercial real estate company Canreal Management Corp. and its president, Ray Bergen, in a disclosure list to the media. She also wanted to get COPE's list out before Vision Vancouver did, she said.
"The general process for donations with COPE is to enter them in our database under the donor's name. When preparing the disclosure, I ran a contributions report from our database, gave it a once-over and sent it out," she said at a news conference at COPE's headquarters in Mount Pleasant.
"Before releasing the disclosure, I should have checked with [financial agent Margaret Panton] and I should have checked with my co-campaign manager. I felt it was more important to get it out quickly, and I regret that.
That was my mistake."
Ms. Beuhler said her working relationship with Ms. Panton had broken down in early October and that she felt consulting her on the matter "wasn't an option."
Meanwhile, Ms. Panton said she was asked only at the end of September to become the party's financial agent in October.
Ms. Beuhler's resignation comes three days after a scathing speech by Ms. Panton at a postelection COPE meeting, during which the financial agent accused members of spending thousands of dollars - about 12 per cent of all campaign expenditures - without her authorization, accepting developer donations and then not disclosing those donations.
Both Canreal president Mr. Bergen and other COPE executives maintain Canreal is a property management company - not a development company. Nonetheless, the party has pledged to repay the $12,500 and develop a new vetting procedure.
With COPE's total campaign expenditures sitting at around $70,000, the omitted donations account for about 18 per cent.
Ms. Panton has declined an interview request. Meena Wong, COPE's mayoral candidate, has not responded to interview requests this week.
COPE has until Feb. 13 to file its full campaign disclosure statement with Elections BC. However, that statement must be accompanied by the signed declarations of its financial agent and if Ms. Panton refuses to sign off on all expenses, the party may have to appoint a new financial agent who is willing to do so.
Under the Local Elections Campaign Financing Act, elector organizations that do not file the required statement cannot endorse candidates in an election and are prohibited from accepting campaign contributions and incurring election expenses until after the next general local election.
"A financial agent needs to make the reports; whether or not it's this financial agent, we will see," Ms. Beuhler said. "But I sort of doubt COPE will give up its status as an electoral organization because of this."

Full text:   Canadian businesses - from mining giants to cigar stores - are beginning to calculate the fallout from the U.S. move to open up relations with Cuba, which could eventually generate opportunities for some and increased competition for others.
While the moves by U.S. President Barack Obama to ease economic, travel and diplomatic relations between the United States and Cuba are small steps, and fall far short of an end to a decades-old trade embargo, they could lead to a broader opening up of relations.
One of the biggest Canadian investors in Cuba is Sherritt International Corp., a resource company that generates the majority of its cash flow from Cuban oil and gas operations, along with a nickel and cobalt mining joint venture.
Chief executive officer David Pathe said the changes will have little immediate impact on his company, but could lead to major gains if the full embargo is eventually lifted. Because of the embargo, Sherritt cannot sell any of its production in the United States, and cannot use any U.S.made mining equipment. And it can't raise money in the United States.
The easing of relations is "is a good start," Mr. Pathe said, although "it is early days yet."
Cuba has been a "stable jurisdiction" for Sherritt, and the company has had success there, but "there has always been some noise around it and some uncertainty as a result of the relationship between Cuba and the United States," he said.
"If [this] is a step towards alleviating some of those concerns in the minds of investors, that will be good for Cuba, and what is good for Cuba is good for us," Mr. Pathe added. Sherritt investors appeared to agree. The stock rose 26 per cent on the TSX Wednesday.
Mr. Pathe, his children, and a number of directors and officers of Sherritt are still unable to travel to the United States because of restrictions that apply to people linked to companies that do business in Cuba. "That has not changed as a result of anything that has been announced, [but] I would be delighted if it did in the future," he said.
Wally Berukoff, president and chairman of Red Lion Management, which has a long history of doing business in Cuba and a number of interests in the country, primarily related to real estate, said the potential for Canadian companies to expand operations in the Caribbean's largest island is immense.
And, he said, these prospects span a wide range of industries. "I foresee a day where a lot of our green vegetables come from Cuba, not California."
Providing the technology to increase crop yields, exploiting mineral deposits, dredging ports, developing and managing resorts, drilling for oil in the North Cuba Basin, financing business ventures, and rebuilding highways are some of the best opportunities available for Canadian firms, according to Mr. Berukoff.
On the financial side, Bank of Nova Scotia and Royal Bank of Canada are positioned to take advantage of increased activity in Cuba once capital is allowed to flow more freely into the country, given their ties to the area and surrounding regions.
But across all industries, Canadian firms could face new, stiff, competition.
"I hope that Canadian companies see this as an opportunity and take advantage of it before the Americans do," Mr. Berukoff said.
"We can't compete with the vast amount of American capital, but we've been friends with Cuba for a long time and there's a vast amount of respect for Canadians in the country."
Dundee 360 Real Estate Corp., a Canadian firm that has three hotel projects under way in Cuba, sees the opening up of relations with the United States as being positive, on balance.
The moves to increase commerce, travel and telecommunication will be good for local and foreign businesses operating there, and could eventually improve access to financing for projects on the island, said Dundee 360 chief financial officer Colin Yee. While there may be more competition for real estate development, "we have first mover advantage," he said. "We have the contacts there."
But John Price, a Canadian who is a Miami-based managing director at Americas Market Intelligence, thinks a full end to the embargo - when and if it comes - "will take some of the lustre out of Canada's position in Cuba.
Right now, he said, Canada has "a sort of disproportionate influence in importance as a source of tourism, as a source of trade and as a source of investment." But that "will certainly be weakened if suddenly there's a normalization of economic relations between the U.S. and Cuba."
For some, however, an opening up of trade between Cuba and the United States is entirely bad news. Anis Serhan, manager of the Downtown Cigar Shop in Windsor, Ont., said an end to restrictions on U.S. imports of Cuban cigars would be very damaging to his business, which sees a large number of Americans crossing the border to buy them in Canada. Mr. Serhan said even his Canadian customers will desert him to cross-border shop if those cigars are available in the United States with lower taxes.
While Cuban tobacco restrictions have not yet been fully lifted, when they are, "it is going to hurt my business, really big time," he said.

The 10-year rule fits for home buyers, too: Insulate yourself from big dips in real estate value: Planning for a multi-year holding period can make financial sense

Abstract: It's happened before. Numbers from the Canadian Real Estate Association show that after reaching $254,197 in 1989, the average house price in Toronto fell so long and hard that it took until 2002 to set new highs. Vancouver housing prices averaged $148,861 in 1981 and didn't crack that level again until 1988. Calgary hit $107,739 in 1981 and didn't surpass that level again until 1989.

The ugly stuff going on in the stock market lately could happen in housing.
So follow the same 10-year rule as a home buyer that you should as an investor. If you can't wait a decade or more for your transaction to make financial sense, don't do it.
Stocks have been kicked hard in recent weeks, while housing is sailing serenely into a 2015 where forecasts of improved sales and prices on a national basis are piling up. The only negative on housing lately, and it's a big one, is a Bank of Canada estimate that prices may be 10- to 30-percent overvalued.
It's time to start getting real about housing - the longer it keeps rising, the sharper the ensuing adjustment will be. We live in a jittery, news-saturated financial world today that can take shifts in sentiment about assets such as oil or stocks and amplify them into wipeout trends. Houses don't have immunity. They are financial assets, just like stocks, gold bars and gallons of oil, which is to say prices move both up and down.
It's happened before. Numbers from the Canadian Real Estate Association show that after reaching $254,197 in 1989, the average house price in Toronto fell so long and hard that it took until 2002 to set new highs. Vancouver housing prices averaged $148,861 in 1981 and didn't crack that level again until 1988. Calgary hit $107,739 in 1981 and didn't surpass that level again until 1989.
In the stock market, the way to protect yourself from the risk of big declines such as this is to commit to a holding period of 10 years or more. Five years won't do for stocks - never kid yourself about that. Example: For the five years to June 30, 2012, the S&P/ TSX composite index and S&P 500 both lost 0.7 per cent and the Morgan Stanley Capital International Europe Australasia Far East (EAFE) index - it's basically an everywhere-but-North-America index - lost 6.5 per cent a year. Note: The S&P and EAFE returns are priced in Canadian dollars.
A 10-year hold should work for housing, unless we get a crash like the one in the United States in 2008 or in Toronto in the late 1980s. Neither seems likely based on current market conditions. If you do buy a house for 10 years, you need to think long and hard about your purchase because you won't have the recourse of addressing your house's shortcomings by moving up in a few years.
First-time buyers, make sure there's room for kids, and that the local schools are up to your standards. If you're planning a move up to a larger home in your late 40s or 50s, think twice about buying a big barn that will feel too large when the kids have moved out and it's just you and your spouse living there. As an insurance policy in case you outgrow your house, check for renovation potential. Could you, for example, add a bedroom in the basement?
The 10-year rule has implications for millennials looking at condos as a first foray into the housing market. In a column earlier this year, I made the case for members of Generation Y to skip the condo purchase if they aspire to quickly move up to a house (read it online at tgam.ca/ ECys). The 10-year rule very likely rules out a transitional condo unless it has room for a baby.
One way for home buyers to act on the warnings we've seen from the Bank of Canada and others about overvalued housing is to decide not to buy until prices fall. But home buying is more than just a financial calculation. People buy for lifestyle and life-cycle reasons that make more sense to them than what the Bank of Canada says. The 10year rule is especially for these buyers. It gives them a mantra if house prices fall after they buy: "We're here for 10 years or more - plenty of time for prices to bounce back."
Falling prices is a worst case for housing. We could also get a flat period or years of minimal growth that doesn't keep up with inflation. The 10-year rule covers you in this type of market by keeping you in place long enough for growth to return to the housing market.
In the stock market, the decline is an entirely normal setback after a long period of gains. The same is coming to housing at some point, and a 10-year perspective will help you get over it.

Full text:   BUILDER/DEVELOPER North Drive
SIZE 1,291 to more than 3,000 square feet
PRICE From $1.2-million to more than $3-million .

A renowned architect and interior designer were brought on board by North Drive to craft a boutique condominium residence with many of the luxuries, but none of the maintenance required of grand estates in the prestigious Kingsway community.
"We thought it made perfect sense to bring in somebody like Richard Wengle to design the building in that he has designed a number of the custom homes that our purchasers will be moving out of, and the same can be said of Brian Gluckstein," North Drive principal Jordan Morassutti says.
"[Pre-registrants] love Richard and Brian because they see them as being modern traditionalists and they really like the transitional designs they've come up with that's not overtly modern and not stuffy at the same time."
Leading up to the sales launch next year, details of this eightstorey building are communicated via intimate affairs rather than big ads, similar to preview events the developer hosted for its High Park project.
"With our first project, larger units were very popular amongst dinner-party purchasers," says Mr. Morassutti, explaining how one couple told neighbours about buying a large suite over dinner and three followed suit the next day. "So we perceive this [project] appealing to this market."
The infill project will house 30 suites and five street-level townhouses on a site abutting a park where The Kingsway and Bloor Street West intersect, near Old Mill Road.
"4 The Kingsway fills a void in the luxury west-end condominium market and appeals to downsizers who do not necessarily want to move to Yorkville but had previously felt as though that was their only option when thinking about downsizing to a condominium," Mr. Morassutti states.
"They have children and often grandchildren, golf clubs and social networks keeping them in the west end."
Local attractions range from Étienne Brûlé Park and the Humber River to Old Mill subway station and Kingsway and Bloor West Village shops and restaurants.
Private amenities will also be available in the neoclassical midrise, which will feature a brickand-stone façade punctuated with balconies and windows, a porte-cochère and turret topped with a zinc-clad dome.
Inside, units will offer open principal rooms and Wolf and Sub-Zero appliances. "The majority of units have his and her closets, as well as dens, libraries and large five-piece en suites," Mr. Morassutti notes.
"The smallest units are oneplus-dens, but the dens would be larger than bedrooms in comparable buildings, and they even have a den against the windows that could double as a second bedroom."
Townhouses will feature 13-foot ceilings and entrances to the garage and street, including some facing the park. "The towns are quite unique in that they mainly wrap along the curve of the building, so unlike townhouses that are 16- or 17-feet wide, these are unique shapes," Mr. Morassutti notes.
"They're typically wide shallow configurations that are on three levels with direct access from the P1 level."
Units come with parking. Anticipated occupancy will be fall of 2017 and monthly fees 70 cents a square foot.

It would serve us well to take note of what's happening with our neighbours.
Vancouver's soaring real estate market is only part of a West Coast phenomenon. The wealthy elite is going bonkers in its demand for new and bigger houses. Los Angeles is seeing its luxury housing market go into a supersize mode never seen before. Always an enclave for the rich, the neighbourhood of BelAir is seeing good houses that are 15,000 to 20,000 square feet in area torn down and replaced with houses that are a whopping 60,000 to 70,000 square feet.
L.A. Councilman Paul Koretz's district includes Bel-Air and Hollywood. He says in all his years on council, it never would have occurred to him that people would need homes three times bigger than the original.
"It's being driven by a lot of international wealth," he says. "A lot of different economies are coming up, and they all think they should have a home in the U.S., and if they can have one, it's going to be Bel-Air.
"Things are just going crazy," he says.
It's so crazy that a unanimous city council voted last month to put an emergency moratorium on demolitions in crisis areas.
"After that, it will take about 18 months for an ordinance to cover the whole city to tighten up the mansionization rules," Mr. Koretz says. "It really has become an emergency situation."
Mr. Koretz's district includes middle-class areas that are under siege from an influx of wealthy property investors. Vancouver's west side will relate. In L.A., developers are razing charming old Spanish-style bungalows in favour of giant boxes. Angelinos refer to the practice as "mansionization." The issue has driven anti-monster house activists to protest at real estate open houses. There are reports of residents that have tossed full doggy waste bags onto the lawns of offending big house homeowners.
Los Angeles and San Francisco are also grappling with new density and wealth at a rate that seems, at times, impossible to manage.
In Vancouver, we have our backlash against bulky new artsand-crafts-style houses that are replacing smaller character homes. In L.A., it's the faux Tuscans that are raising eyebrows.
The building of massive new homes right up to the property line has caused major blowouts in some L.A. neighbourhoods.
Residents have lost privacy, sunlight and views as a result. Vancouver has restrictions against that sort of thing. But in West Vancouver there is the case of a little house currently under siege because of a massive land clearing all the way up to its property line. We covered that story a few weeks ago.
In San Francisco, residents say they're losing their community as real estate investors evict tenants in favour of more lucrative Airbnb guests. Why deal with long-term tenants when you can make more money from transient out-of-towners? I was walking around San Francisco a few weeks ago, and as always, I envied the picturesque, intact old neighbourhoods. But then I talked with Mike Buhler, the executive director of San Francisco Architectural Heritage.
He says the city's enviable stock of Victorian houses is under threat of that bête noir known as façadism. Façadism is when a builder guts the house and only leaves the front wall standing, often the only part protected by heritage laws.
New homeowners are stripping away the old architectural interior details, such as wainscoting and coffered ceilings. They are refinishing their homes with the contemporary white-on-white look instead.
"Even if you have a completely intact interior with woodwork and wood panelling from the early 20th century, there is no regulatory protection," Mr. Buhler says. "It is an increasingly common occurrence to see façadism, especially when there is an influx of wealthy new residents."
Vancouver is feeling the pressure of new wealth, both domestic and foreign. California's cities are feeling the pressure of a rebounded economy after the 2008 downturn. Also, there's that tech-industry megaboom, a powerful group. In San Francisco, there's an emerging class of wealthy young people who work for local companies such as Twitter. Developers are responding by providing double sinks, walk-in closets and app-controlled alarm systems.
"It sounds like Vancouver, in the respect that they want all the modern amenities of a contemporary home," Mr. Buhler says. "But they also want to live in an established urban neighbourhood with historic character."
Vancouver civic historian John Atkin says all desirable cities are facing an influx of wealth. The situation is testing heritage preservation, as well as affordability. In London, there is a bizarre trend toward subterranean living, nicknamed "iceberg houses."
Developers are building three or four stories below ground level. It means they can add square footage while following height restrictions, Mr. Atkin says.
"You are seeing the phenomenon now of that desire to live in the central city. But cities are forcing homeowners to have to deal with heritage laws and they are not thrilled with it.
"They want to bend that poor old house into something it was never meant to be."
For San Francisco, it isn't its first go-round with sweeping change.
Mr. Buhler's organization formed in 1971 in response to the demolition of a swath of important Victorian houses. San Francisco has a long history of heritage activism that is still strong today, he says.
But his job description has broadened over the years to include affordability and density. San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee has set up a task force devoted to creating affordable housing in the form of tens of thousands of new units, for all income levels, Mr. Buhler says.
"It's a hot topic of discussion - we're seeing in certain parts of the city lots of new Vancouverstyle, tall, slender residential towers.
"Of course, the concern among many is that the new housing units will be market rate. And they won't impact affordability and provide housing for middleclass residents, like teachers and firemen," he adds.
He could be talking about Vancouver.
San Francisco and Vancouver have many parallels, but drastic differences, too. Houses aren't coming down to the tune of three or four a day, like they are in Vancouver.
"I think that's because we have a pretty highly evolved preservation protection. The planning department in the city has many staff dedicated to just preservation issues. Five years ago, through voter initiative, we created a historic preservation commission that has new powers.
Before, it was just an advisory board hat had no regulatory authority."
San Francisco Heritage is also taking a pro-active approach by including the tech sector in the discussion. Community leaders are attempting to get a conversation going with the wealthy new demographic. For example, Mr. Buhler's group held an event with Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey.
"There is resentment aimed at tech for being the cause of the increase in property values. That's the perception," he says. "And Jack Dorsey acknowledged that is the key challenge. How do you provide more density without sacrificing the San Francisco we know and love?" Then there are the tax breaks, another difference.
San Francisco already benefits from the locally administered Mills Act, which offers a major tax incentive to protect old buildings. In exchange, historic property owners commit to maintaining and improving their property for 10 years.
"The Mills Act adjusts the property tax assessment to reflect the actual use of the site, rather than the market value based on comparable sales. For just improved or recently purchased properties, this alternative assessment method will often result in a property tax reduction of 50 per cent or more," Mr. Buhler says.
A 50-per-cent tax break is a big carrot for any homeowner. And a task force set up to address issues such as affordable housing and density is a pro-active measure - as opposed to pushing through with more development, no matter the social cost.

Abstract: The crisis draws in all of Dog River, even the apathetic Brent Leroy (Brett Butt), who buys the out-of-business hotel bar in order to reinvigorate the local economy (or at least keep the down-andout denizens of Dog River plastered). Elsewhere, Brent's thickheaded best buddy Hank (Fred Ewanuick) courts a predatory Timmies-ish coffee chain, oblivious to the effect such competition would have on the local diner owner Lacey (Gabrielle Miller).

Full text:   Corner Gas: The Movie Directed by David Storey Written by Brent Butt, Andrew Carr, Andrew Wreggitt Starring Brent Butt, Eric Peterson, Nancy Robertston, Fred Ewanuick, Gabrielle Miller Classification: PG; 90 minutes 1½
People like to talk about is how "television is the new movies," how the post- Sopranos premium (and basic) cable landscape has ushered in a golden age of TV drama and comedy. There are compelling arguments on both sides of the TV versus movies smackdown, even if it's an ultimately pointless debate that tends to ignore arguments of medium-specificity in favour of sweeping generalizations of quality, sort of like asking, "are doughnuts the new pears?" But nothing reveals TV's latent anxieties about its own worth quite like the spinoff movie.
Enter Corner Gas : The Movie, a feature-length adaptation of the popular and, I'm told, beloved CTV sitcom, which for six seasons transposed the well-meaning, sometimes backbiting folksiness of Stephen Leacock's Sunshine Sketches onto the nohorse prairie town of Dog River, Sask.
Funded by a consortium of Telefilm, CTV and the provincial tourism board, Corner Gas : The Movie feels like an ad for sleepy Saskatchewanian hospitality, spinning a triumphant yarn about Dog River's attempt to save itself from bankruptcy after the mayor (Cavan Cunningham) rolls the town's coffers into a series of inadvisable - and highly topical! - real estate investments in Detroit.
The crisis draws in all of Dog River, even the apathetic Brent Leroy (Brett Butt), who buys the out-of-business hotel bar in order to reinvigorate the local economy (or at least keep the down-andout denizens of Dog River plastered). Elsewhere, Brent's thickheaded best buddy Hank (Fred Ewanuick) courts a predatory Timmies-ish coffee chain, oblivious to the effect such competition would have on the local diner owner Lacey (Gabrielle Miller). Also, Wanda (Nancy Robertson) opens an illegal casino, Sergeant Davis (Lorne Cardinal) is forced into early retirement and goes fishing with Graham Greene, and Brent's ornery dad (Eric Peterson) buys a horse.
Yes, all the fan favourite characters of Brent Butt's admired Cancon tax deduction are in attendance, bound to satisfy all the hardened Butt-heads who have been mindlessly surfing through CTV and CBC sitcom lineups since Corner Gas took its primetime bow in 2009. Having never seen a full episode of Corner Gas, yet vaguely aware of its popularity, it's nonetheless exceptionally easy to keep up with who's who and what's what in the Corner Gas universe.
After all, it's a franchise. And like so many franchises, it trades almost exclusively in stock types.
But more than the broad stereotyping of the characters - bossy city girl, sarcastic man-child, cranky old man, dopey metalhead, cranky old woman - Corner Gas deals with the broadest, most palatable assumptions of Canadian identity.
We're nice, but not too nice. We help each other, but we do it while sniping and bickering and calling each other dummies. Our earthy, down-home peculiarities are forever endearing. It's pretty much a basic cable Trailer Park Boys, pruned of all the weed and swearing (and jokes). As one character puts it, offering up a Corner Gas thesis statement that might as well be rendered in needlepoint and hung above the entrance to your quaintly ramshackle farmhouse, "Friends and family is all we need."
It's a lazy, boring, self-validating attitude. But it's hard to want to argue with.
To the embedded Corner Gas fan base dedicated to this wellmeaning folksiness, criticizing the movie for its niceness, or for its barn-broad jokes, or the way you can practically hear it groaning as it stretches the half-hour sitcom format to 90-plus minutes, probably just smacks of somuch snarky, big-city gum-flappin'. And considering that the only thing more obvious than Corner Gas's abundant amiability is its total innocuousness, I'd have a hard time arguing with that, too.

Full text:   FORT MAC This article marks the beginning of a yearlong project about Fort McMurray, Alta., which has come to be the emblem of Canada's energy sector - and all the issues that surround it.
For years, business luncheons in the oil sands have been scenes of unbridled exuberance. Yet at the Sawridge Inn off Highway 63 on Monday, Fort McMurray's businessmen and women had something unpalatable to chew over with their roast pork and lasagna - oil selling at less than $70 (U.S.), and dropping fast.
"Let's batten down the hatches now, instead of after," said one entrepreneur in the conference room. "I have an offer on my house. So you think I should I accept," another audience member asked. One attendee asked about a pundit's "doom and gloom" post on YouTube: "He's forecasting ... a 70-per-cent reduction in the stock market."
The Chamber of Commerce networking luncheons in Fort McMurray are not as heady as they used to be.
"Now, of course, we see moods changing. All because of this," said speaker Todd Hirsch, an economist from Edmonton's ATB Financial, pointing out that a barrel that sold for $107 in July sold for $66 on Friday - and that as a result, a "slowdown" is ahead in Fort McMurray and beyond.
"Are we back in 2009," he asked rhetorically. "Are we going back to $33 a barrel?" No one at Monday's luncheon in Fort McMurray expects things to get quite that bad. Yet nowhere in Canada are the changes wrought by falling oil prices likely to be more profound. Dozens of well-heeled Fort McMurrayites were in the audience, and several said they are going to "proceed with caution" in their enterprises.
Officials in Fort McMurray, which calls itself "Canada's economic treasure," frequently boast of doubling the population in the span of a decade, and having an annual family income of nearly $200,000 (Canadian) a year.
This windfall was achieved by the oil sands, the massive energy-harvesting projects that critics contend are rapidly altering the landscape of Northern Alberta and the atmosphere of the planet.
Not everyone believes that. "We only produce 0.5 per cent of global carbon emissions ... our emissions are not peanuts, they are fractions of peanuts," said activist Robbie Picard, who was wearing a hoodie with "I Love Oilsands" on it.
Long before oil prices started dropping, economic caution had already been seeping into Fort McMurray.
One common complaint is that a growing number of workers are flown into and out of oil sands work camps from faraway cities such as Calgary, Edmonton and Kelowna, B.C. This deprives the city's coffers and retailers of their taxes and their business.
No one expects the big oil companies to stop extracting oil, but newer ventures and startups are seen to be vulnerable.
Last month, an energy economist for the municipality wrote in the local paper that "we can expect a decline in production and employment in the oil sands sector during 2015" that will affect tax revenues.
In a late November meeting for "newcomers" at the Royal Bank, immigrants said they loved the jobs and opportunity in Fort McMurray. But some wanted reassurance the bad times would not accelerate as quickly as the good did over the past decade.
"You want to make sure that our $1.5-million houses' value is not going to be $200,000 in 10 years," one municipal official said at that meeting.
She said the oil companies and city are working together to make sure nothing of the sort happens: "These discussions are very serious, in the high level."
Some homeowners say the real estate market was softening long before the price of oil started to drop.
"We've seen our price dip 15 to 20 per cent over the last 18 months," said Jon Tupper, 41, the homeowner who asked whether he should sell his house.
"We've lost equity." But he adds that he still wants to upgrade to a home nearby.
Mr. Hirsch said all Albertans will have to wrap their heads around depressed oil prices: "Here we are again, where the governments are going to be cutting budgets and blowing up hospitals and schools. ... We need to look at more stable sources of revenue. And that's a sales tax."

The social scene in Montreal, the bilingual metropolis unlike any other in Canada or indeed the world, is as varied as its arts and culture, much of which is supported by said diverse scenesters.
There's the old guard, those with their surnames on hospital and museum wings, long-standing political connections and permanent spots on Forbes's annual list of billionaires. Among the most prominent (and generous) are Federal Construction Ltd. founder Michal Hornstein and his wife, Renata , who in 2012 donated their cherished collection of 80 Old Master works to the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts; in 2017, the museum will open the Michal and Renata Hornstein Pavilion for Peace, a major expansion project that will coincide with Montreal's 375th anniversary. Jean Coutu Group founder Jean Coutu and his wife Marcelle , meanwhile, have his-and-hers pavilions at the Institute for Research in Immunology and Cancer (IRIC) at the University of Montreal and also support education programs in the fight against drug abuse. The grande dame of Quebec society is Jacqueline Desmarais, widow of the late Power Corp CEO Paul; she's a pal of former French president Nicolas Sarkozy (he was her escort at her husband's memorial service) and her attendance alone is the stamp of approval many balls and benefits long for. Fellow members of the old guard include almost anyone from the Bronfman, Bombardier-Beaudoin, Molson, Greenberg and Mulroney clans. Expect to see them at ribbon cuttings or holding court at major local fundraisers such as Le Grand Bal des Vins-Coeurs, the Goodman Cancer Research Gala, the annual gathering of the Council for Canadian American Relations or the upcoming Grands Ballets Ball.
Muscling in on the old guard's territory are the city's and province's many entrepreneurs, from business leaders to forward thinkers. Some have brought dusty family dynasties back to life while others have established their own from the ground up. Alison Silcoff is the party-planning powerhouse who spearheaded the Daffodil Ball, the most anticipated (and successful - $27 million raised since 1994) cancer-related fundraiser in Canada; the next ball, set for mid-April, is being chaired by some of her friends in high places, including SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. CEO Robert G. Card , CIBC board chair Charles Sirois and Deloitte LLP's Frank Vettese . Claridge executive chairman Steven Bronfman has taken the company founded by his father, Charles , in 1987 in a new and exciting direction, having invested early in organic and specialty foods, real-estate development and even Broadway shows; alongside his wife, Claudine Blondin , a former Molson marketing executive, Bronfman also initiated SéminArts, an education project designed to fuel the contemporary art market across Quebec. Since 1984, when he founded Cirque du Soleil, Guy Laliberté has redefi ned circuses and show business, producing spectaculars that have been seen by more then 90 million people worldwide; in 2007, he launched the One Drop Foundation, a philanthropic venture that provides access to clean water in developing countries. McGill grad and former lawyer Isabelle Marcoux , meanwhile, has taken over where her father, Rémi , founder of Transcontinental Inc. in 1976, left off, serving as board chair of the company, the largest printing and media activation enterprise in Canada. She also raises major funds for Montreal Children's Hospital and the Tel-Jeunes Foundation. Hers is a powerful household; her husband, François Olivier , is Transcon's president and CEO.
Finally, there are the cool kids - the ingenues, swans, comers and arty types who bring a hip factor to gala dinners, fashion happenings and museum benefits. Weather by blood or by marriage, for example, nextgen members of the extended Desmarais clan are making their mark. In 2013, France Chrétien Desmarais , daughter of former PM Jean, saw her daughter Jacqueline-Ariadne Desmarais tie the knot with Belgian Prince Hadrien de Croÿ-Roeulx in the social event of that year. More recently, Mary Dailey-Desmarais was in Montreal with husband Paul Desmarais III for one of the more anticipated happenings, the MMFA's annual gala, chaired this year by Alan and Roula Rossy ; also on hand were museum director, curator and Denis Gagnon supporter Nathalie Bondil , Emmanuelle Duperre (also in Gagnon and the wife of Cirque du Soleil president and CEO Daniel Lamarre) and JulieKatherine Turcotte (another bright socialite and frequent committee member). Bloggers who make sure the scene is well documented include two of note: Lolitta Dandoy (a fashionable girl-about-town) and Jennifer Campbell (who's Diary of a Social Girl is focused on the local party circuit and its key players, herself included).
Other assorted scene makers include Nathalie Schwartz Décarie (daughter of jeweller George Schwartz ); Isabelle Hudon of Sun Life Financial; Scotia McLeod wealth manager Jacques Maurice and his model/socialite/writer wife, Dominique Bertrand ; makeup maven Lise Watier and her husband, Serge Rocheleau ; art advisor Debbie Davis Goodman ; the artist Heidi Spector and her lawyer husband, Chuck ; and Suzanne Legge Orr and her husband, Jeffrey .

Full text:   Foxcatcher Directed by Bennett Miller Written by Dan Futterman and E. Max Frye Starring Steve Carell, Channing Tatum and Mark Ruffalo Classification: 14A; 134 minutes 4
The title Foxcatcher refers to the 800-acre Pennsylvania estate owned by the wealthy du Pont family, where hunters on horseback chased foxes through the fields and packs of beagles tore the prey to bits. This is the blood sport of the privileged, which Oscar Wilde characterized as "the unspeakable in pursuit of the inedible," which is something of the spirit of Bennett Miller's superb new film.
Foxcatcher Farm is the setting of Miller's elegiac true-crime drama, only his third feature following Capote (2005) and Moneyball (2011). At the film's heart are three unforgettable performances: Channing Tatum, doing the best work of his career as the physically powerful but emotionally vulnerable Olympic wrestler, Mark Schultz; Mark Ruffalo, deeply empathetic as usual, plays his shrewd, modest older brother, Dave. And the performance that set the press abuzz at Cannes, where the film premiered last May, comes from an unrecognizable Steve Carell, as John Eleuthère du Pont, a multimillionaire heir to the Du Pont fortune. With a prosthetic nose, shaved eyebrows and a pinched vocal delivery, he suggests an anthropomorphized bird of prey, and, indeed, asks to be known as "the Eagle."
The three performances are anchored by a fiercely concentrated script from Dan Futterman ( Capote ) and E. Max Frye ( Something Wild ), which reveals the changing relationship of the three men over nine years, incrementally revealing layers of madness, privilege, repressed sexuality and eventual violence.
We see this story through the eyes of Mark Schultz (the script is indebted both to Mark Schultz's co-authored memoir, Foxcatcher , and Tim Huddleston's Wrestling with Madness ). Three years after winning gold at the Los Angeles Olympics, he's living in a rundown apartment, living on instant noodles and honorariums from speaking engagements at local elementary schools. His older brother, Dave (Ruffalo), is his only real friend and coach. Everything you need to know about their relationship - the intimacy, the rivalry, the speed and violence of the sport they love - is captured in the opening scene: a prolonged practice session between the two brothers in an empty gym.
Now Dave wants to take a university coaching job in Colorado with his wife, Nancy (Sienna Miller), and their children, and Mark is at a low point. Then Mark gets a call to come visit the Philadelphia estate: A first-class plane ticket and then a helicopter ride to the estate, where a wrestling camp will be based. Du Pont is obviously an oddball whose conversation is a free-association: He calls the lack of support for athletes "the canary in the coal mine," which causes him to jump to a discussion of his love of ornithology, then back to how he wants to help America "soar again."
Mark nods along. Shortly after, he's installed in a sprawling chalet built on the property. The amenities are grand, the mood gothic. The arrangement has the the fairy-tale weirdness of Beauty and the Beast, except the beauty is a hulking wrestler and the beast an awkward, slope-shouldered weakling. Mark is given strict instructions by security staff: If, while wandering around the estate, Mark should encounter John's imperious mother (Vanessa Redgrave) he is to ignore her. Under no circumstances, unless invited, is he to enter the main house. The horse-dotted fields are lush and the woods marked with running trails, but the mood is Hitchcockian: There are echoes of the 1940 marriagethriller Rebecca, or even Psycho here. John is entwined in a needy, antagonistic relationship with his disapproving mother. She thinks wrestling is "low;" he thinks horses are "dumb."
His goal, initially, is to help Mark prepare for the world wrestling championships and then the 1988 Seoul Olympics. By now, the wrestling camp has grown into a facility of a dozen or more wrestlers. There's a lot of horseplay between "Coach" du Pont and his team, all dressed in Team Foxcatcher sweats. There are pats of encouragement that linger awkwardly and late-night personal wrestling practices. Du Pont's unsettling vocal rhythms and mannerisms - staring off into space for a moment when he's displeased - grow increasingly unnerving. Du Pont introduces Mark to cocaine, which gives us the only scene in the movie where we're reminded of Steve Carell, the comedian. While snorting lines and flying a helicopter, he goes over a speech he has written for Mark, extolling du Pont's achievements: "Ornithologist, philatelist, philanthropist," he chants.
When Mark, predictably, begins to slip as an athlete, du Pont turns on him. Du Pont next persuades older brother Dave and his family to come stay at the Foxcatcher Farm, offering a salaried head-coaching position. But Mark is doing worse than ever. At the 1988 Olympic trials, Mark is a mess - he goes on an eating binge after blowing a match - and Dave struggles to help him, while mediating with du Pont.
But by now du Pont is in another orbit, ordering a tank-sized artillery gun and carrying a handgun with him, even to the gym. But then, the Du Pont family built up one of the longestrunning fortunes in American history by manufacturing gunpowder for the American Civil War. The tragedy that eventually happened at Foxcatcher Farm in January, 1996, almost seemed predestined.
The world of Foxcatcher is a deeply lonely place. The desaturated cinematography is chilly and flat. The gyms and hotel rooms are impersonal and unglamorous while the Foxcatcher house is spacious and expensive to the point of absurdity. The film offers no explanation for what happened in the storm raging in John du Pont's head, but the circumstances of the crime are familiar, a distillation of what's in front of our eyes on TV every night: The perilous wealth gap; blowhards with millions treated like media oracles; arms manufacturers spouting patriotism and athletic pride co-opted by corporate patrons. It's a dogeat-fox world, and a terrible way to treat people or other animals.
The triumph of Foxcatcher is not in the subject but in its art. The clear-eyed compassion and moral intelligence of Miller's film brings sense to the senseless, and finds the human pulse behind the tabloid shock. It's not a movie to make you feel good, but, at moments, it reminds you what goodness is.

Occupation
Realtor
The portfolio
Mainly income properties, plus fixed-income and equity mutual funds in a registered education savings plan and registered retirement savings plan.
The investor
Braden McLean is an Ottawa real estate agent. He's also a devoted hockey dad who spends many evenings and weekends cheering for his two kids at local arenas. On cold winter nights, he and his wife, Amy, can be found outdoors, maintaining the backyard rink.
How he invests
"I have focused on purchasing rental properties as I am a Realtor and can determine good investments for long-term growth," says Mr. McLean. "My strategy is to buy and hold: I rent the properties out and pay off the mortgages to eventually provide a long-term monthly income."
Before buying, he determines how much neighbouring properties are renting for, and how long it usually takes to find tenants. "Is the neighbourhood appealing? Is it close to shopping, schools and transit, for example?"
The neighbourhood should also have good prospects for longterm appreciation. "It should be in an area with a history of price increases and growth," Mr. McLean notes. "Is it gaining in popularity, is the city investing in new infrastructure, or are new businesses starting up?"
He always makes sure that he can meet the down payment requirement and monthly carrying costs - whether the rental is occupied or vacant. If the rent fails to cover expenses, the losses can be used to reduce taxes payable on employment income.
In addition to his rental properties, Mr. McLean has focused on paying down the mortgage on his principal residence. But he wants to diversify his savings and is now increasingly moving into financial assets held in tax sheltered plans, notably registered education savings plans and registered retirement savings plans.
Best move
"Purchasing rental properties and investing in RESPs."
Worst move
"Not investing enough over the years in an RRSP."
Advice
"Pay off your mortgage as soon as possible."

Abstract: Unlike the surroundings of Omen's canvas, hers has a much higher concentration of foot traffic. It's more appealing for passersby to linger. "I walk by and I see the spot of colour and it puts a smile on my face," says Corktown resident Beth Jordan. "You want to look at the story that's being told on the pillars."

Full text:   The image of proud, smiling monochrome faces is serene and inviting, a complete juxtaposition to its viewing perch - a median underneath the subway tracks near Warden Station on St. Clair Avenue East. This may seem an unlikely place for a piece of art to honour working women during the Second World War, but it's part of a municipal initiative designed to reclaim such neglected spaces.
The Scarborough Junction mural, by Montreal artist Omen, is one of five commissioned this fall as part of the Underpass Program. It's an offshoot of StreetARToronto, the city's attempt to embrace and legitimize street art.
StART, as the city's Transportation Services department's program is also known, had already identified underpasses that had potential for art, in particular those that wouldn't require structural rehab in the next decade.
"Generally, they're quite dingy, not places that are celebrated in the community," says Kristina Hausmanis, StART's project manager.
The city wants to change that perception. The man ultimately responsible for the transformation is Stephen Buckley, the general manager of Transportation Services. Mr. Buckley was lured away two years ago from his hometown Philadelphia, a city renowned for having the biggest public art program in the United States.
Last spring, StART recruited 23 artists to be on a roster for projects around the city. A committee representing each of the five underpass sites decided on a theme, shortlisted three artists and solicited design proposals from them. After community consultations, the committee reviewed comments, graded the submissions and chose a winner.
Each mural serves its respective neighbourhood in a different way. Long-time Toronto muralist Bill Wrigley's depiction of birds' and butterflies' migratory journey across the Scarborough Bluffs is simple by design, given that its audience is primarily made up of motorists.
Paul Aloisi's mural, Synesthesia , on Davenport Road north of Dupont Street, is interactive, allowing the audience to dial in to hear the sound of moving trains that inspired the strokes of paint on the walls.
And artist Elicser paid tribute to the mothers who take care of the Rail Garden on Woodfield Road, a collection of garden plots for neighbourhood use. His work makes the tunnel connecting the neighbourhood to Monarch Park a little less intimidating.
Toronto-based Elisa Monreal's homage to local factory workers and settlers came out on top in Corktown. Her artwork splashes around the pillars where Adelaide and Richmond Streets sweep over King Street East.
Unlike the surroundings of Omen's canvas, hers has a much higher concentration of foot traffic. It's more appealing for passersby to linger. "I walk by and I see the spot of colour and it puts a smile on my face," says Corktown resident Beth Jordan. "You want to look at the story that's being told on the pillars."
In a sense, Monreal's mural will be a gateway between two parks, Orphan's Green and Underpass Park, and harmonize the orphaned space in between.
Monreal - who has participated in art projects around the world including Chile, Brazil and Mexico - believes Toronto is only just warming up to street art. "A couple years ago there was a negative connotation when you would say graffiti. Street art is a new vocabulary," says Monreal, whose artist moniker is Shalak Attack.
While the overpass itself is unattractive, Councillor Pam McConnell, whose ward includes Corktown, feels the artwork at least mitigates the way it has intruded upon the neighbourhood's prime real estate.
"The overpass had really sliced our community in half. It was a huge barrier to connecting people between the West Don Lands and Corktown," Ms. McConnell says. "It was essential that we really take some of those orphaned spaces and make them feel safe. The StreetART program gave us an opportunity to test that out."
The mural is one part of a transition beneath the hulking concrete that began with Underpass Park and could be a blueprint under the Gardiner Expressway's belly downtown. But it's a work in progress, one Ms. McConnell hopes will make more corners feel safer. "Those activities that are out of sight, out of mind flourish in those sorts of spaces.
In Corktown, we had a lot of those spaces.
"This art project begins to rehabilitate these empty spaces. And when that happens you don't have people camping out, people availing themselves of prostitutes or drugs."
Arthur Sinclair, vice-president of the Corktown Residents and Business Association and a civil engineer, says he's a firm believer that the proper environmental design can curb undesirable activity and attract family-friendly use of the space. "I find that increased awareness of the surroundings is a very good thing for community cohesion," he says.

A house divided into apartments on a busy street used to be the kind of property that took time to sell in Toronto.
In the current fall market, it's the kind of property that attracts two bully bids and 11 offers overall.
The house at 1690 Gerrard St. E. attracted a particularly aggressive bully who made an offer soon after the three-unit dwelling landed on the market, says real estate agent Lance Van der Kolk of ReMax Hallmark Realty Ltd., who represented the seller. The bully ratcheted up the pressure by stating the bid would expire the following morning at 10 a.m.
Mr. Van der Kolk points out that the rules insist listing agents contact anyone who has seen the house or expressed interest. In this case, he hadn't even held the agents' open house yet. The sellers were out of town. He resisted the 10 a.m. deadline and pushed it off until 7 p.m., when the sellers agreed to review offers.
During that time, 10 other parties put their offers together, including two of Mr. Van der Kolk's clients. In cases like that Mr. Van der Kolk has his wife Brenda or another agent in his firm represent one of the parties.
Mr. Van der Kolk says the sellers were a husband and wife who were astonished to be getting so much action the second day on market. "They were absolutely shocked and overwhelmed."
The wife in particular felt sorry for agents and their clients sitting outside in their cars with the heaters on. At the end of the evening, the house had sold for $755,000, or 26 per cent above its asking price of $599,900.
This is the kind of action that pushed the average selling price in the Greater Toronto Area up 7.6 per cent in the first two weeks of November compared with the same period last year, according to the Toronto Real Estate Board.
Sales rose 8.3 per cent and listings 2.2 per cent in the first half of the month compared with the same period in 2013, TREB says.
In October, the average selling price climbed 8.3 per cent compared with the same month last year. The Canadian Real Estate Association reported this week that the heat in Toronto and Vancouver has skewed the national average price increase.
The national average price for homes sold in October 2014 was 7.1 per cent higher when compared with the same month last year. But if the data from Toronto and Vancouver are stripped out, the national gain comes in at a more modest 5.4 per cent.
CREA president Beth Crosbie says low interest rates continue to support the sales action in Toronto and other hot markets such as Calgary and Edmonton. But she points out that sales did not increase in many local markets in Canada.
On Gerrard Street, the buyer was real estate agent Kevin Smith of ReMax Hallmark, who intends to keep the three apartments and rent them out. On offer night, he knew there were four offers registered when he left home. By the time he got to Gerrard Street, there were 11.
"It was exciting to win."
Mr. Smith was drawn to the property for its landscaped backyard on the edge of a ravine. Fairmount Park is right across the street and the upper windows look out over the park's trees.
"The beautiful backyard is really appealing and it's ready to go," he says.
He wasn't the bully but he could have been because he knew he was interested as soon as it hit the market. "In all honesty I was going to be one of the bullies but it was Remembrance Day so I couldn't talk to the bank."
Mr. Smith met the owners as he signed off on the deal. They have owned the house for about 10 years and had done extensive renovations. The house has great flow, he says, and the two-level upper suite would make a great owners' unit.
"They put some time and effort into it and I'm sure it paid off for them."
He says he plans to hold onto it for a while.
Mr. Van der Kolk says some of the prospective buyers were thinking about converting the house back to a single-family home, while others wanted to live in one unit and rent out the other two. He says lots of first-time buyers in particular are looking at a substantial mortgage with prices rising as quickly as they have in the past several years.
"If you're a young buyer trying to get into this insane and hectic market ... being able to get a unit and rent two out is very attractive."
It's also worth noting that not all Toronto houses sell with multiple offers.
Mr. Van der Kolk also represented a buyer recently who was the only bidder for a house in Riverdale. The buyer paid $860,000, or approximately $20,000 under the asking price of $880,000.
"On the buyers' side I like to win them in a single bid."
Buying and selling real estate requires lots of savvy in such a fast-moving market.
The Canadian Real Estate Association and the Real Estate Council of Ontario are reminding house hunters that November has been declared "financial literacy month" in Canada. Both organizations are taking the opportunity to educate consumers about the ins and outs of buying a house.
They realize that lots of house hunters out there don't have the knowledge and resources of a business editor.
RECO recently commissioned a survey that found that 41 per cent of buyers wish they had done something differently when buying or selling their property.
The online survey of 1,043 Ontario-based homeowners was conducted by Angus Reid. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.3 per cent, 19 times out of 20.
RECO found that 52 per cent of respondents incorrectly believe that buyer and seller representation agreements - those contracts that agents ask for - are standardized.
Forty-three per cent of those surveyed admitted that there were parts of the real estate contract when they bought or sold a property that they did not fully understand.
And 55 per cent of the respondents incorrectly assume that if you place a conditional offer on a home and the deal doesn't go through, you automatically get your deposit back. In fact, a deposit - which is held in trust by a brokerage - can only be released if both buyer and seller agree, or by court order.
Only 42 per cent had the correct understanding that real estate agents are allowed to represent both sides in a deal - that is, both the seller and buyer on a property - if the parties agree to it in writing. That circumstance, known as "multiple representation," can be seen as a conflict of interest so buyers and sellers need to know what they're getting into.
The RECO survey found that 19 per cent of respondents wrongly believed the practice isn't allowed at all.
RECO registrar Joe Richer points out that buying and selling real estate is confusing and stressful for plenty of people; he hopes more potential buyers will take the time to do some research so that they have less chance of making a move they later regret.
RECO has posted an online interactive game and other information on its website.
CREA has joined with the Financial Consumer Agency of Canada to create videos for CREA's YouTube channel. They cover basic terms and concepts such as the definition of "amortization" and "mortgage prepayment."

LISTING AGENTS Josie Stern and Valerie Benchitrit, Sutton Group-Associates Realty Inc.
The Action : Just a few blocks from Wychwood Barns, this triplex was seen as a prime real estate, so there was a constant flow of shoppers with contractors and architects during two open houses and 30 mid-week showings. Before the week was out, there were four competing offers.
What They Got : This three-storey, brick structure, built in 1910, is set up with three units, each with a bathroom, living area and kitchen with a fridge and stove, plus a private driveway on the 45-by-156-foot lot.
Notable features include a fireside living room, a dining area with French doors and a kitchen with a walkout to the deck from the one-bedroom suite on the main floor, as well as a second floor deck with spiral stairs down to the treed grounds off the kitchen in the two-bedroom suite on the second floor.
The Agent's Take : "Properties like this don't come up every day. It's not your typical cookie cutter house," says agent Josie Stern. "It has old pocket doors and French doors, stained glass, hardwood floors, beautiful mouldings and very high ceilings. And the whole house was a stone home, which is very unusual, and it also had very unique eavestroughs and fascia, it was like Japanese-style that flared."
Plus, buyers were a fan of outdoor amenities. "[Buyers] liked the park-like backyard," says Ms. Stern, who cites most lots merely 25 or 30 feet wide. "Hillcrest Village is buzzing with activity and progress [with] upscale shops like the popular Roast [Fine Foods] where local residents line up out the door to pay for the aged beef; Pain Perdu's delicious smells wafting through its doors; Leah's Desserts' owner welcoming the neighbourhood with her warm personality; and Rocket cyclists enjoying their after-spin coffee at Starbucks."

Full text:   The race to replace Jim Flaherty is nearing its end, as a local mayor running for the Conservatives aims to fend off a strong push by Justin Trudeau's Liberals.
Three years ago, the federal finance minister took 58 per cent of the vote in Whitby-Oshawa, just east of Toronto in the voterich "905" region. Heading into Monday's by-election, however, polls show former Whitby mayor and Conservative candidate Pat Perkins has only a slim lead over Liberal Celina Caesar-Chavannes, with whom Mr. Trudeau has campaigned regularly.
"Last time, I ran against Jim Flaherty. This time, I'm running against Justin Trudeau," says NDP candidate Trish McAuliffe, a General Motors employee and community activist who finished second in 2011.
A Forum Research poll released this week shows the Conservatives have a four-point lead on the Liberals, with the NDP well behind. The Liberals, with their own polling, now believe a win is possible, but still think Ms. Perkins has the inside track, sources say.
Ms. Perkins, meanwhile, is positioning herself as the experienced candidate, saying at a debate on Thursday that electing her would give Whitby "a seat at the table where decisions are being made, which absolutely no other candidate here can offer you." She earned the endorsement of Mr. Flaherty's widow, provincial MPP Christine Elliott.
But Ms. Perkins has faced her own questions. She needed, and received, special permission to run for the Conservatives because she bought her current membership only in July, and won a nomination race during which her rival complained of party interference.
She also raised eyebrows this week. Canada is on pace to badly miss its emissions-reduction targets. Ms. Perkins, when asked about it during the debate, said: "I'm sure we could find other experts who could say something to the contrary" and suggested researchers are divided on climate science. "We need some consistency of ideas from our scientists. They are at both ends of the spectrum. They haven't come together with solutions. You can't expect a politician to decide which one of these scientists is correct."
Meanwhile, one regional councillor, Joe Drumm, says he believes Ms. Perkins would not have won re-election as mayor, and questions have been raised about her record.
Her expense records show she billed the town more than $4,000 for seven nights in Cannes, France, in 2012 to attend a fourday real estate conference.
"It was an economic development thing. We've had some uptake on it but there's nothing concrete in the ground on it," Ms. Perkins said in a brief interview this week, before campaign workers intervened and told journalists she needed to leave. She was criticized at the time for not telling her council she was going.
The Liberals, meanwhile, have their own concerns. In an interview with the local Whitby This Week newspaper, Mr. Trudeau said voters there have been "spoiled" by Mr. Flaherty, because he would "stand up to Stephen Harper," a comment some Conservatives interpreted as an endorsement of the party's track record in the riding. Meanwhile, the Liberal candidate - an entrepreneur and health-care research consultant - was criticized by opponents for missing a debate.
Asked about a lack of political experience, Ms. Caesar-Chavannes said: "I have a fresh perspective. Clearly, there is much room for engagement and consultation and a person who has an evidence-based approach to policy, to legislation. And that's what I bring."

Full text:   It took two tries to get the dirt right. When the cowboys said no to the first attempt, it was removed and replaced, then packed by a tractor and levelled into place by a small team of men with shovels.
When they finished, they had a pancake-smooth crust of hooffriendly earth, a little wedge of rodeo heaven stacked on top of a parking lot in Shanghai. The 10-gallon hats of those who came to inspect it made for a jarring contrast to the next-door China pavilion, the brilliant red inverted pyramid designed as a symbolic nod to an Oriental crown during the Shanghai Expo.
On Friday, it will be the backdrop to the International Barrel Horse Federation World Cup, with 24 countries competing over three days in a sport that, until a few years ago, was almost completely unknown in China. Now, with the help of a Canadian cowpoke, some fat Chinese bank accounts and Mongolian riders who declare themselves the descendants of Genghis Khan, it's beginning to grab a foothold.
Getting rodeo to China hasn't been easy, with a series of highprofile failures that have, among other problems, left a herd of bucking bulls in the country with no one to ride them.
But the wandering appetites of the country's super rich have found in barrel racing the allure of owning finely bred horses matched with a chance to stage a potentially profitable audience-grabbing sport.
People have told Chu Wen, the man who calls himself "the father of Chinese barrel racing," that China "has no horse culture." But then, until a few years ago it didn't have basketball or soccer cultures, either. Maybe, he figured, horses could catch on, too.
Barrel racing offered an easy way into competitive equestrian sports, with simple rules, adrenaline-boosting speed that might prove popular with spectators and horses that could be bought for a fraction of the cost of a thoroughbred.
Mr. Chu, who made his money designing and engineering highways, doesn't ride, but does have a nose for a windfall. If the Calgary Stampede could bring out 1.4 million people in a country of 35 million, he says, think what he could do in China, where Beijing and Shanghai alone have more people.
"It's going to win me money," he said in English, laughing.
Then he added, in Chinese: "But I also like horses."
Mr. Chu convinced others barrel racing had a future in China, and in 2008 Yu Luzhong, a Qingdao real estate development magnate, flew to Verona, Italy, for a World Cup event. The champion was Chris Blane, a native of Brantford, Ont. Mr. Yu offered him a job on the spot.
"I said, 'I'll do it, but I want to go home first,' " Mr. Blane recalled. "He said, 'No no. Don't go home.' " A few days later, Mr. Blane found himself in a world where a decision to buy a $55,000 horse was made on a whim.
When he protested that he didn't like Chinese food, his new boss flew in a Western chef to make steak, bacon and eggs to a cowboy standard.
Language was a problem, of course. Even today, the Canadian can't pronounce the names of the riders he trains. So he calls them Whitey, Crazy and Mr. Butter. The linguistic failings were two-sided: Mr. Yu speaks "no English at all, except for a couple bad words I taught him," Mr. Blane said. Out with the horses, however, "it's amazing how much the language disappears," he said. "I can teach you by feel."
Cultural issues proved trickier. The Chinese riders Mr. Yu hired wanted rigorous training every day, thinking "practice makes perfect." But riding a horse too often and too hard can be disastrous. "They get hotter and hotter, and you wreck them," Mr. Blane said. Mr. Yu has now hired two vets from Germany.
More difficult still has been working in a country whose officials have shown little love for rodeo.
In 2011, Richard and Carrie Tucker laid plans for an extravagant introduction they called "Rodeo China." The South Carolina couple, retired from an apparel empire built in part by trademarking "Don't Mess with Texas," booked the Bird's Nest, the marquee Olympic venue, and grabbed the endorsement of action star Jackie Chan. They set an eye-popping $8-million purse and bought bulls in Australia and horses in the U.S. - 153 of which were quarantined and assembled in Lexington, Ky., for their flight to China.
A week before the stock was about to leave, the Chinese government cancelled the event, after an outcry from groups who decried what they saw as rodeo's mistreatment of animals.
This year saw a repeat. The Professional Bull Riders promised to make history with a three-city Chinese tour and an $8-million purse. The bulls were delivered, and the riders got visas. Organizers spent months training Chinese to ride, eager to please the hometown crowd.
Then the tour was cancelled, with promoters blaming China's war on corruption for making local officials skittish. The bulls remain on Chinese soil, with no competition to attend.
The Shanghai event will cost nearly $1-million to stage, which the $185 tickets for 1,200 seats won't cover. But the talent is developing. "It won't be more than five years" before a Chinese barrel racer cracks the worldwide top three, Mr. Chu predicted.
Consider Tekesibai, a 24-yearold rider who, like most of the best horsemen in China, is Mongolian. "We are the offspring of Genghis Khan," said Tekesibai, who goes by one name. He grew up in the northern mountains of Xinjiang, the sprawling western territory of China where even today riders on horseback drive cattle over the nearby border with Russia.
"We started quite late," Tekesibai says. "But our skills aren't that far off from the rest of the world."

Form and function preserved: Architect Don Schmitt's design for Blue Diamond condos seeks a deeper link to the past

Author: Bentley Mays, John

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/form-function-preserved/docview/1620992778/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: The challenge for Mr. [Don Schmitt] was the disposition of a cherished, picturesque Gothic-revival building, the former home of Deer Park United Church, that occupied much of the site designated for high-density development. Given the architectural protectiveness that informs much of Toronto's official and popular thinking about the past, wholesale demolition of the structure was probably never considered seriously by anyone.

The world-wide vogue for architectural preservation has never stopped changing at any point in its long and fascinating history. Within the living memory of today's pensioners, for example, only the mansions of our betters and the most august public monuments were popularly deemed worthy of salvation from modernity's wrecking ball.
Now, after just a few generations of consciousness-raising by heritage activists, every old warehouse, cottage, Victorian brick and Edwardian plank, and even some relics of modernism, can find numerous vocal defenders among citizens at large and in the bureaucracies of municipal and other governments.
But the usual concern of preservationists, whether old-fashioned savers of palaces or newer-fangled guardians of factories and vernacular dwellings, has always been the material fabric of the antique building in question, not the program that originally shaped it. Architectural conservationists have traditionally counted it a victory, for example, when the concrete bones and workaday stylelessness of an old warehouse survive its conversion into a stack of condominiums.
Unless a local historian takes an interest, however, the overhaul will likely erase all traces of the warehouse's life in its industrial heyday - the story, in other words, of the technical processes and the human sociabilities for which it was once the setting.
But is there a visually evocative way to preserve the story, as well as the stuff, of a building that has outlived its program? Can contemporary architecture incorporate a recycled structure in a way that allows it to say something about its history - not merely in words on a commemorative plaque, but in the language of three dimensions?
Toronto architect Don Schmitt, co-founder of the well-known firm Diamond Schmitt Architects, believes he has come up with some answers to these questions in his scheme for Blue Diamond, a new residential project by Camrost-Felcorp on St. Clair Avenue West, a few steps east of Avenue Road.
The challenge for Mr. Schmitt was the disposition of a cherished, picturesque Gothic-revival building, the former home of Deer Park United Church, that occupied much of the site designated for high-density development. Given the architectural protectiveness that informs much of Toronto's official and popular thinking about the past, wholesale demolition of the structure was probably never considered seriously by anyone. Which it shouldn't have been, since neo-Gothic styling of houses and churches is as much a part of Hogtown's visual identity as the CN Tower.
But room had to be made on the small plot of ground for a condo tower, and also for a halfdozen townhouses on little Foxbar Road, which is lined by lowrise residences. Mr. Schmitt's design aims to satisfy the various parties with interests in the site, including the owners, neighbours apprehensive about losing a local landmark and Toronto's other heritage-minded citizens.
If everything unfolds according to plan, the developer and homehunters will get a glassy 28-storey tower Mr. Schmitt described to me as "discreet, quiet and simple." Its south-facing units will enjoy wonderful views over the downtown core. Amenities at Blue Diamond will be minimal, but residents will have access, via a tunnel, to the spacious fitness and recreational facilities at Imperial Plaza, the condo block next door.
For their part, neighbours, passersby and aficionados of Hogtown neo-Gothic will have the tall belfry and steeply pitched streetside entrance of the church, which will be left standing where they have been since the building went up in 1913.
Given only a glance, this move could be dismissed as merely another instance of the cheapskate, pseudo-preservationist tactic sometimes called "façadism." But what Mr. Schmitt proposes to do is more interesting than that. The interior behind the façade, the architect told me, will be deep enough to accommodate a café, and the structure will offer a suitably impressive entry to an openair public courtyard. This little garden, to be landscaped by Janet Rosenberg, will be created by removing the roof from the nave, while leaving the church's exterior walls, east and west, to enclose and frame the space, which will open south toward the large ground floor of the tower.
But Mr. Schmitt intends this place to be something more than a gracious gesture to people who appreciate Toronto's treasury of revival architecture. Properly seen and understood by the public, he told me, it will become a site of meditation, exchange and communal gathering - a contemporary expression, in other words, of the community-building done by the people who worshipped on this spot for almost a hundred years.
If the architect's objectives are met, we may discover that preservation, at its best, can indeed be about more than saving old buildings from bulldozers. It can also recall the spirit of a place, something of the spiritual and creative energy that originally raised the structure's rafters and walls.

Rising, literally, from the ashes of twentieth-century architecture, Delft University in the Netherlands is building the twenty-first.
In May, 2008, a faulty coffee vending machine caused the Faculty of Architecture at Delft University of Technology to burn to the ground; luckily, no one was hurt. In a few years, the land where that 1970 building once stood will be a bustling, sustainable place bursting with ideas: In partnership with business and industry, the "Green Village" will host Future Labs, innovative LED lighting, offices, an event centre, a restaurant with robots as "part of the hospitality team" and "Engine Square."
Today, however, the Green Village is home to just one very clever idea: Prêt-à-Loger - "House with a Skin," which demonstrates how simple it can be to rehabilitate postwar twentiethcentury housing.
In the Netherlands - as well as in Britain, Germany, France and some North and South American cities - row/terraced houses built between 1945-1975 make up a huge percentage of the housing stock. In fact, professors at TU Delft estimate there are 1.4 million in Holland alone, and most suffer from mould and air quality issues, poor insulation and a general lack of space (for modern lifestyles); in some cases, owners can barely afford to keep the heat on in winter.
Still, says Prof. Andy van den Dobbelsteen, it's not a simple matter of replacement: "You could demolish all these houses and build new ones, which are more sustainable, but then you wipe out the memories of these people and their values.
"We wanted to find a balance between improving the house, but also preserving the home, because it's more than a house to these people."
Using one team member's cherished early-1960s family home in the town of Honselersdijk as a textbook example, the group of more than 50 students built an exact replica to enter into the 2014 Solar Decathlon Europe in Versailles. Since the original home averaged a whopping 175 (about $250 Canadian) a month in energy costs - a sow's ear up against the brand new, silky sustainable buildings and pavilions dreamed up by other contestants - winning would be a long shot, despite the innovative application of a "second skin" that both renders the home energy-neutral and adds valuable living space.
The skin is made up of two parts. At the front of the home (facing north), original brick was removed and 20 centimetres of cellulose insulation applied; this was then dressed with brick veneer to simulate the original, homey façade. At the rear, however, a massive, greenhouse-type structure with built-in solar panels has been gently attached to the existing structure in much the same way Daniel Libeskind's Crystal at the Royal Ontario Museum "kisses" the heritage building.
Descending from the peak of the angled roof and floating slightly above it to create a gap, the new structure then projects into the garden to create a warm living space during shoulder months, an outdoor "room" in summer, and, in winter, a cooler space that can still support some plantings. The solar panels - while most are fixed, a few are "clerestories" motorized to swing upward to face the sun when it's warm out, thereby providing ventilation - provide enough energy to run the home. Passive solar heat generated in the gap between the roof and panels is collected also; this helps cool the solar panels so they always operate at maximum efficiency.
The garden beyond the greenhouse has been designed to be sustainable also, with native plants fed non-toxic fertilizers, and planters and landscaping built with local, recyclable materials.
Standing in the original small living-dining-kitchen area, your humble Architourist tried to imagine a family of four living comfortably without the new addition. While it's certainly possible (heck, I grew up in something smaller, but that was the 1970s!), the new, bright addition helped make the old floor plan feel much larger by borrowing space, visually, in much same way a high ceiling can make a tiny bedroom tolerable. The incredible amount of light gave an ethereal quality that took this working-class home up an architectural notch.
Those intangibles, says Prof. van den Dobbelsteen, will "sell" sustainability to a public that may care little about it beyond cheaper energy bills: "It's making people interested because it adds so much more to the value of their current house."
And speaking of value, while this one-off totalled between 70,000-80,000, if Prêt-à-Loger were put into mass production, costs are estimated to be a more manageable 50,000. Currently, TU Delft is working with business and industry partners to see what's possible; Prof. Craig Martin says this is part of the team's wish that their work has "a life after the competition" (by the way, TU Delft came in third, only three points behind the winning team).
While row/terraced houses may not be as common in Toronto, it does bring to mind our "Tower Renewal" initiative, meant to rehabilitate the thousands of 1960s high-rises in Ontario via reskinning for energy-efficiency, and the rezoning of underutilized land around their bases to encourage retail.
When that monumental task is done (Toronto has the secondlargest number of apartment towers in North America), perhaps we might look a little closer to the ground: Our thousands and thousands of century-old semi-detached homes are lacking, and the Dutch are ready to help.

Full text:   In a city where anxiety about affordable housing and homelessness runs higher than for any other issue, voters are caught between a muted response from one major party and a controversial status quo from the other.
And COPE's Meena Wong, the candidate who has been most vocal about housing issues, hasn't yet nailed down some problematic details.
The Non-Partisan Association's Kirk LaPointe, who unveiled his party's platform Tuesday as advance voting started, has largely avoided specifics on those two key issues as he challenges Vision Vancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson for his job.
Instead, he focused during his announcement on creating affordability by cutting city taxes and attracting higher-paying jobs to the city.
The Vision Vancouver council has "become addicted to development charges that raise the cost of new development projects," Mr. LaPointe said. "Imagine, driving up housing costs while they talk about affordable housing."
When it comes to specific solutions, he has in the past talked largely about solving affordability and homelessness problems by restarting what he calls a genuine conversation with voters.
Pressed for a more definitive final message on those issues Tuesday, he told reporters to read the party's platform and declined to elaborate.
Mr. Robertson, meanwhile, has promised to keep doing mostly more of what he's been doing the past three years, although with some refinements.
Vision has been giving developers density bonuses in return for building apartments that are guaranteed as rentals but at market rates, as well as pouring city money from development fees into subsidized-housing projects.
Councillor Raymond Louie says Vision is looking at ways to enforce lower rental rates in agreements with developers as it encourages them to build another 4,000 units in the next four years.
But Vision's efforts of the past two terms have been vilified by many because of the low number of apartments created that rent for below-market rates and the tradeoffs it has made with developers.
And COPE's Ms. Wong has outlined a comprehensive housing strategy that calls for extremely aggressive action.
Included in the 98-page proposal and her explanations of it: $80million a year on spending for new subsidized housing; a registry that would keep tabs on vacant properties and charge owners an extra fee for their unoccupied premises; a new regime for city permits where landlords would only get permission to renovate their apartments if they promised to rent them back to the original tenants at the same price.
Ms. Wong, pressed for answers at a Globe editorial board meeting on how these ambitious and complicated programs would work, acknowledged that some would be complicated, such as enforcement of the vacancy tax.
She also pointed to many other cities, especially Hong Kong, as examples of how local governments can take strong action, and said that London has successfully imposed a vacancy tax.
In fact, London doesn't have its own vacancy tax, but the British government did authorize local councils in 2013 to levy a 50-percent tax surcharge on houses that have been empty more than two years, which several councils, in London and elsewhere, have done.
Earlier this year, it also announced a tax surcharge on properties worth more than £500,000 (About $910,000 Canadian) that are owned by corporations.
In Vancouver, housing costs, along with a fear that offshore investors are outbidding locals for real estate, have been a preoccupation in the city since the early 1990s.
Homelessness became a concern in the early 2000s, after changes to housing and welfare policy under the then-new B.C.
Liberal government produced a massive spike in the numbers of people sleeping outside or in shelters.
But those two issues have soared to new heights in public consciousness the past couple of years, as Vision's promises to tackle those issues collided with skyrocketing house prices on the west side, complaints that the city was being bought up by foreign investors who were leaving their properties empty, and stubbornly intractable homelessness numbers.
Mr. Robertson has promised to continue fighting hard to end homelessness and create a new supply of rental and family housing.
Mr. LaPointe has focused, instead, on attacking the mayor's party for the way it has rewarded developers, approved projects in the face of community objections and failed to meet its promises of ending street homelessness or building truly affordable housing.

Full text:   For more than 20 years, Rob Mayer manned the front doors of some of Atlantic City's biggest casino hotels, greeting gamblers, carting bags and getting hefty tips. He loved his job and never imagined working anywhere else.
Mr. Mayer spent most of his career at Bally's, but when he heard about plans for a $2.4-billion (U.S.) resort called Revel, he jumped at the chance to work there and earn $20 an hour. The new job didn't last long. Revel shut its doors in September, a little more than two years after it opened. And it's not the only casino to go down. Three others have also closed this year amid a stunning downturn in the city's gambling business.
"It was going to be my retirement job," Mr. Mayer says as he passes time in a union hall. "It was a great opportunity to make a lot of money."
For decades, Atlantic City was an Eastern beacon for fun and games, a resort town that came to be known for its gleaming boardwalk lined with flashy casinos that rivalled those in Las Vegas. This is where the Miss America Pageant began, where stars like Marilyn Monroe, Frank Sinatra and Bing Crosby came to play and where the board game Monopoly was invented using the city's street names like Boardwalk and Park Place.
Today, the city is a shadow of that glorious past.
Gambling revenue has fallen by nearly half in the past seven years. Just eight casinos are left, and one, the Trump Taj Mahal, is teetering. Nearly 8,000 jobs have vanished with the casino closings and many neighbourhoods are lined with abandoned homes.
Now the city is counting on a Canadian company to help turn things around. A subsidiary of Torontobased Brookfield Asset Management Inc. is buying Revel for just $110-million, part of a push Brookfield is making into the casino business. It's a risky bet.
Revel was supposed to help reinvent Atlantic City when it opened. While other establishments made the casino the focal point of their venue, gambling almost seemed like an afterthought at Revel. Instead it tried to offer a new level of luxury and celebrity with a 32,000-square-foot spa and four shows by Beyoncé to kick off the grand opening. Its sleek 47-storey glass structure stood out as a symbol of sophistication amid the bright lights and kitsch along the boardwalk. But now the building sits empty, an imposing derelict of failed dreams.
Just how Brookfield might turn around Revel's fortunes remains to be seen. Brookfield's deal for the resort hasn't closed, and company officials have yet to spell out their plans. That means people like Mr. Mayer can only wait and hope that the Canadians will succeed where so many others have failed. Some of his former colleagues have packed up and headed to Las Vegas. He is staying put.
"I'm waiting for Revel to reopen and once it reopens hopefully I'll be re-employed there," he says.
What went wrong
Atlantic City had its heyday long ago.
Stretching just 48 city blocks on Absecon Island, Atlantic City started out as a seaport in the 1800s but soon became something of a resort town as hotels and shops sprung up around the docks and boardwalk. By the turn of the century, city officials began looking for ways to attract more visitors who came mainly from nearby Philadelphia. They tried a small beauty pageant that ultimately became the Miss America Pageant. But it wasn't enough.
Finally in the 1970s, they hit on what they thought would be the jackpot. Residents voted to give casinos the green light, allowing the city to quickly corner the market as the main gambling destination in the eastern United States.
But gambling never became the economic panacea they hoped for. The median local income rose from $25,340 in 1979 to $32,408 in 1989, and then fell to $29,886 by 2012, according to the Urban Land Institute, a Washington-based think tank. Adjusting for inflation, residents have actually seen their purchasing power cut in half since 1989.
For a long time that reality was lost amid the bustle of the casinos. "Gaming revenues increased for 30 straight years in Atlantic City, and there was really no reason to believe that it would turn around," says Roger Gros, publisher of Global Gaming Business Magazine.
But it did, and quickly, for two reasons: competition and the financial crisis.
A number of nearby states including Pennsylvania and Maryland legalized gambling, putting a dramatic end to Atlantic City's eastern monopoly. "There are about 17 casinos now that operate within a two-and-a-half-hour drive, and three or four [more] that are getting licensed," says John Palmieri, executive director of the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority, or CRDA.
The financial crisis, meanwhile, appears to have left a permanent dent in consumers' appetite for gambling. In June, Moody's Investors Service cut its outlook for the U.S. gambling industry from stable to negative, citing weaker demand, high fixed expenses and oversupply. It noted that regional gambling revenues, excluding Nevada, remained flat even as the U.S. economy improved and more casinos popped up.
Mr. Gros says that what's happening in Atlantic City could be a harbinger for other cities. "Seven years ago, Atlantic City's gross gaming revenues were $5.2-billion, last year it was $2.8billion and this year it looks like it's going to be in the $2.5-billion range," he points out. Meanwhile the city's population has fallen to 40,000 from its peak in the 1930s of 66,000.
The city's struggles
The fallout from the casino closings is starting to spread across the region.
Atlantic City already has one of the highest unemployment rates in the U.S. and nearly onethird of its population lives below the poverty line. Home foreclosure rates are also among the highest of any major U.S. city. There were 401 foreclosure filings in September, according to real estate website RealtyTrac, up from 264 a year earlier.
"People are starting to walk away from their houses - they're not paying their taxes," says Alfred Kare, a waiter in the Trump Taj Mahal, which could close in December if the owners don't get some financial help from governments. "It's going to trickle down to everything."
As casinos shut down, the city's property tax base is eroding, drying up funding for badly needed services. To make up the revenue shortfall, city council recently raised residential taxes by 29 per cent at a time when fewer people can afford it. Eleanor Murray, who runs a local commercial real estate firm, says the taxes on a triplex she owns went from $12,000 to $18,000 this fall. She'd like to rent it out, but is having a hard time finding anyone. "I can't rent, the building's sitting there empty and it's absolutely beautiful," she says.
And another major casino could soon close.
The Taj Mahal is in bankruptcy and owner Trump Entertainment Resorts recently received court approval to break its labour contract. Billionaire investor Carl Icahn, a Trump Taj Mahal debt holder, has said he will buy the casino and invest new money in it but only if labour costs are slashed and government aid is secured.
"Some of the waiters in my restaurant haven't paid their mortgages for two months now because they're so nervous that we're going to close," Mr. Kare says. "The average wage in our union is $12 an hour. I'm a waiter, and we make about $9. One guy I talked to last night that works with us, he has three kids and [health care insurance] is going to cost him $1,400 a month."
On a recent weekday, the Taj Mahal appeared barren compared to other casinos in the city. The union says potential customers shy away from places with labour disputes. But some analysts and observers blame the unions for the city's financial woes.
"It's a huge part," Mr. Gros says. "These contracts were negotiated at the height of Atlantic City's success seven years ago, and there was never any giveback by the unions. Plus there are all kinds of really ridiculous work rules, like a waitress can't clear a table, it has to be a busboy."
The Local 54 union, which still has about 10,000 members that make up about one-third of the workers in the majority of the casino hotels, paints itself as being in a battle against Wall Street. "A half dozen years ago or so, casinos stopped being run by casino companies and they started being run by private equity and hedge funds," says Ben Begleiter, a union spokesman. "It's a fight between working people in this country and the wolves who occupy Wall Street."
Charles Baker, a relief cook at the Taj Mahal, worked his way up at three different casinos over his career.
"I now make $20 an hour," he says. "They promised us good jobs, good pay, good benefits that I can raise my family on, which I did. My kids are all grown now. ... This is a union town, everyone should have a union job."
While the finger-pointing ensues, Atlantic City's social services are feeling stretched.
The number of kids using the residential services at Covenant House is up, says director of programming Brian Nelson. And it's not traditional homeless people, he adds, but couch surfers.
For example, "we had an instance where two brothers who were unemployed were staying with a sister, the sister lost her job and had to kick her brothers out and they came to us."
Phil (Philly) Miller runs a lunch program at the Victory First Presbyterian Deliverance Church across the street from the Taj Mahal. It usually gets busier as each month wears on and people use up benefit cheques they receive at the start of the month. But by mid-October, there were close to 350 people coming in, about 100 more than usual.
On a recent afternoon, a man sitting in a folded chair on the boardwalk held out a cup and begged for loose change, an American flag neatly placed at his feet. He started gambling in his early 20s and couldn't stop. He has been in and out of work since the early 1980s. "When I was working, I'd work, but when I wasn't working, I was living off the casinos for a long time. I'd find credits when people left their stuff in the slot machine," he said, not giving his name.
He's been homeless for much of his life and has a trail of trespassing charges from casinos he's banned at. "As far as the casinos having financial problems, I don't feel sorry for the casinos," he says.
What went wrong for Revel
Revel almost seemed cursed from its inception.
A plane crash in 2008 killed three Revel Entertainment Group executives and three other managers involved in the project.
Construction was hit by a crane collapse, a minor fire and a lightning bolt that killed a worker. In 2010, Morgan Stanley, the major owner of Revel Entertainment, eventually threw in the towel, halting construction and walking away from its roughly $1-billion investment, forcing the state and other backers to find new financing for Revel.
When Revel finally opened in 2012, it brought a new buzz to Atlantic City. But it didn't last long. The resort faced the same competition and economic challenges as the other casinos. And it had some of its own problems, including wildly misjudging the market.
"When they opened, their basic plan was that it was going to be a resort that just happened to have a casino," says former casino greeter Mr. Mayer. "They were going for a real high-end clientele and they thought they didn't need gamblers. And it turned out you need somebody to lose money to pay the bills."
A tour through Atlantic City's casinos will tell you that the majority of its customers are far from high-rollers. Most are dressed in jeans, T-shirts and running shoes, and come for a little gambling and to have some fun. These are not wealthy travellers looking to head to a beach resort with a spa.
The casino floor at the Borgata, which opened in 2003 and is more modern and upscale than most of its competitors, was reasonably full on a recent weekday night. Casual-looking patrons hit the slot machines and tables amid the lights and buzz in a sprawling building that wouldn't be out of place in Vegas. At one restaurant table, six retired friends said they tried Revel when it was open, but decided to stick with the Borgata.
When Revel did attract wealthy clients, it didn't treat them as well as other casinos, failing to offer perks like free food, complimentary accommodation and VIP treatment.
"When we first opened I remember we had one lady, she was a million-dollar player, she would come in expecting to go up to her room and they would tell her 'no, rooms aren't available until 4 p.m.,' " Mr. Mayer recalls.
"Revel never changed their plan; their plan was to make it a resort getaway and gaming would take care of itself," Mr. Gros says. "Well that wasn't the case. You really need gamblers in Atlantic City, that's all you're going to survive on."
The plan for Revel
The question now is whether Brookfield can succeed where so many other casino operators have failed.
Its team has been meeting with officials in Atlantic City to talk about the project for weeks. The company declined to discuss its plans for the facility with The Globe and Mail, but conversations with people that Brookfield consulted and a look at the company's other casino purchases offer some insight.
Part of Brookfield's strategy will likely be to place more emphasis on meeting the needs of people who are already travelling to Atlantic City, and less on trying to draw a higher-end crowd. Brookfield is also likely to invest some money to reconfigure the resort, and create new marketing initiatives.
This isn't the first troubled casino the company has acquired. In 2012, it took control of Atlantis Paradise Island in the Bahamas that was also in financial trouble. It spent millions of dollars on upgrades and convention space. It also planned private gambling rooms, sports events and struck a deal with Marriott to be part of its global booking and rewards system.
Caesar's Entertainment is trying something similar in Atlantic City with its Harrah's Resort. The company is in the process of a $125-million expansion of Harrah's meeting facility. Caesar's and local politicians hope the new venue will allow Atlantic City to boost its current 1-per-cent share of the $16-billion meetings business in the northeastern U.S., and create a conference industry that draws people in on weekdays and diversifies away from gambling, taking a page from Las Vegas.
"What Brookfield has that Revel didn't have is a great mailing list," Mr. Gros says, noting that the company also owns a casino in Las Vegas. "The data that they've got from their Bahamas property, it's largely East Coast people, so they can market to those people."
Revel (which Brookfield might rename) will be facing competitors who are likewise trying to raise their game. "If Revel opens again under Brookfield, that will add some more capacity to the market and there's probably got to be one more casualty at some point," Mr. Gros says.
The plan for Atlantic City
Experts say Atlantic City as a whole must place less emphasis on gambling than it historically has and broaden its income streams. Revel, however, under Brookfield's ownership, is expected to pay more attention to gambling than it did under its previous owners. In some ways, they were ahead of their time.
Local officials have ideas beyond conferences and conventions, and are working on a deal to have a state college buy the shuttered Showboat casino resort and turn it into a campus.
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is planning to hold a second "Atlantic City summit" in November, part of a continuing effort to bring the key groups together and create a solid revitalization plan. In October, he lifted a ban on sports betting in an attempt to create a new source of revenue for Atlantic City's casinos, but the issue is still before the courts because of a federal ban.
Meanwhile Mr. Palmieri, at the Casino Reinvestment Development Authority, is using his powers for planning and land use to try to make the city more appealing. The authority has been working to move some social services out of the main tourist area and in recent weeks it struck its first deal on that front, which will see a drug rehab centre leave town. One of the CRDA's main targets for improvement is the land neighbouring Revel. The resort is to be the centrepiece of an area that also has a historic lighthouse, a million-dollar park that's currently being built, and a lot of land that's being condemned and cleared for redevelopment.
While Atlantic City's gambling business will likely never be the same, it still has a solid future, says Caesar's chief executive officer Gary Loveman. After all, the city receives about 27 million resort visitors every year, according to the Urban Land Institute.
"People who now wish to argue that the Atlantic City experience was a failure based on the period from 2007 to 2014 have a very tough hill to climb," Mr. Loveman said at a recent press conference.
"Atlantic City is not going to be a $5-billion gaming market. It's going to be, we hope, a twoand-a-half-billion-dollar gaming market. That still makes it probably the second-largest gaming market in North America ... and there's nothing wrong with that, we just have to go through the exercise of adjusting."
$2.8-billion
Gross gambling revenue in 2013, down from $5.2-billion in 2007.
40,000
Atlantic City's population, down from 66,000 in the 1930s.
$29,886
Median local income in 2012, down from $32,408 in 1989.

Full text:   Miami is hot, hot, hot again. Back in the late 2000s, the tide went out in Florida with a great sucking sound. Jobs, people, and billions of dollars in investments went out to sea and down the drain when the realestate boom went bust. Tens of thousands of speculators, large and small, lost their shirts. Miami became a city of see-through buildings, full of vacant condos nobody wanted.
Realtor Raul Santridian remembers the pain. "I was caught with over a hundred listings that didn't sell," he says. But now the tide has come back in, and Mr. Santridian is flush. Today he lives on the 32nd floor of an ostentatious Trump building in Sunny Isles, north of Miami Beach, where a wall of ritzy new condo buildings separates the beach and ocean from the hoi polloi on Collins Avenue. Each condo has its own army of vigilant security guards - a growth industry in Florida - to defend the residents from the rabble.
Miami is in many ways a snapshot of America today, where the wealthy are increasingly insulated from the middle-class and the poor. Yet, as voters head to the polls for next week's midterm elections, a great apathy grips the country. People have given up on the political classes of both parties. They simply don't believe their elected leaders are really interested in helping them - or that they would know how to do it if they were.
Florida will soon be the thirdmost-populous state in the union, overtaking New York. Now that the economy has picked up again, people are streaming in from all over - not just snowbirds, but job seekers from Puerto Rico and all across the South. I wanted to find out what life is like for these folks, so I spent a week talking to people down there.
I found out that a lot of them are poor, and getting relatively poorer. And I found that a lot of people in the wealthy class aren't Americans at all. These days, Mr. Santridian's clients are the global rich - from Brazil, Venezuela, Argentina, Russia. There are so many Russians in Sunny Isles that they have their own grocery stores stocked with Russian food.
All these foreigners are eager to deposit their rubles and pesos into a third, fourth or fifth home where the government is stable, the currency is hard, the climate is great, the living is easy, and the people are beautiful.
Why is Miami so hot? "Don't write this down," says Mr. Santridian. "It's the girls. The Russian girls. The Brazilian girls. The Spanish girls. Men want to be around beautiful women. And if they're married ... " He pauses. They still want to be around beautiful women.
You'd better believe it. The poolside scene at the fashionable hotel where I'm staying (I got an Internet deal) would make your eyes pop. It's a great place to check out the latest in rhinestone thong bikinis and six-pack abs. People sip $100 bottles of Champagne in the pool. There are partygoers of every hue and ethnicity. Many are speaking Spanish or Portuguese. The friendly servers look as if they've been recruited from a multicultural fashion ad.
The global elites who come here to play are attracted by the sexy vibe and the diversity. New York may have wealth and culture, but it doesn't have heat.
The globalization of Miami means that prices have gone global too. One oceanfront penthouse has just sold for a record $35-million to a New York hedgefund guy.
One oceanfront penthouse has just sold for a record $35-million to a New York hedge-fund guy. (The details are confidential, but that's what the rumour mill says.) It comes with a private 70-foot rooftop pool with views to infinity.
Also doing well is the Porsche Design Tower, a project explicitly targeted at the nouveau riche with a taste for conspicuous display. It has a separate elevator for your Porsche. No more tedious waiting for a valet to fetch your car. You just drive it into the elevator, which lifts you to your apartment. A glass-walled garage allows you to admire your car right from your own living room.
Foreign buyers now account for the vast majority of Miami's ultraluxury condo market. This time, they are required to put real money on the table. This time, everybody tells me, the market will not collapse from overspeculation. This time, they say, the boom is for real.
But for some, there is no boom, and may never be.
What Disney hath wrought
In 1963, Walt Disney took a plane ride over the swamplands of central Florida and found what he'd been looking for - a place to build his Magic Kingdom in the east. Stealthily, he began assembling land southwest of Orlando. Today, Disney World stretches over 110 square kilometres of real estate, and draws visitors from around the globe.
Central Florida is booming, and tourism is the reason why. Orlando drew more than 59 million visitors last year - more than New York or Paris. It is now the most popular tourist destination in the world. Disney World alone employs around 70,000 people, and the Orlandoarea hospitality industry employs another 150,000. The unemployment rate is under 7 per cent.
But many workers can't live on what they make. Almost 40 per cent of the jobs in the Orlando area pay less than $25,000 a year; 18 per cent of the population lives below the poverty line, including thousands of people who work for Disney.
"Ironic, isn't it?" says Dave Krepcho, who runs the local food bank. "There's a lot of poverty in the shadow of Cinderella's castle."
Although not many tourists visit Orlando's food bank, it is as impressive as anything you'll see at Disney. Second Harvest Food Bank of Central Florida may well be the biggest and most technologically advanced facility of its kind in the world - a vast, 100,000-square-foot complex with state-of-the-art inventory systems and cavernous storage warehouses that are four or five storeys high. Stacks of rice, bananas, mangoes, lettuce, frozen pizzas, turkeys, Kleenex, strawberries, corn, eggs, and canned goods rise to the ceiling; 4,500 kilograms of potatoes are stored in a corner of the cool room. The wholesale value of the food distributed through here every year is $80-million. The food is channelled through 500 local charities and feeding programs. Much of it goes to feed the families of the working poor - people who can afford food or rent, but not both.
"Twenty-five per cent of kids in central Florida are 'food insecure,' " Mr. Krepcho tells me. "Where the theme parks are, it's one in three." Many Disney workers live in cheap motel rooms because they can't afford the first and last month's rent on an apartment. Others live in trailer parks.
Among the food bank's biggest supporters is - you guessed it - Disney. Employees from Disney's creative team (they're known as Imagineers) volunteered their time to construct marvellous Disney-themed murals on the walls. Disney hotels and restaurants donate millions of dollars' worth of surplus food. Disney is careful to cultivate its reputation as a good corporate citizen.
Kathy DeCroix started with Disney when she was 21. She's 46 now, and has spent all but six years of her working life with the company. She makes $12.52 an hour, and lives in a 35-foot motorhome in a trailer park.
"I'm probably better off than lots of our cast members," she told me. (Disney employees are known as "cast members.") "I got almost a $2 raise when I started working transportation."
Ms. DeCroix is Walt Disney's No. 1 fan, and she knows Disney World inside out. She has worked the turnstiles and driven the steam train and guided the safari expedition. Once, she even got to play a bank robber. Today she drives a bus, shuttling families back and forth between the hotels and the theme parks.
She also has lived in the trailer park for five years. She inherited the motorhome from her dad, and drives the 25 kilometres to work in a car bought with the insurance money from his death. She hopes she never has to move, because the motorhome's engine doesn't work any more.
For Disney World, things have never been better. Well-heeled Brazilians are pouring in on direct flights from Sao Paulo. The place is expanding like crazy, adding themes, rides, princesses, resorts, magic shows, restaurants, shopping, and cast members to keep the whole guest experience sprinkled with pixie dust. (Visitors are called "guests.") There's even a gated community where you can buy your very own Disney villa (starting price, $1.8-million) with carvings of Daffy Duck in the mantelpiece. Last year, Disney's theme-park division made a profit of $2.2-billion on $14.1-billion in revenues. Not much of that trickled down to Kathy DeCroix.
Her lot rent is only $375 a month, but her paycheque doesn't go far. After deductions for her health-care co-payment and an ancient student loan she took out in the nineties, her take-home pay is $344 a week. She's also supporting her boyfriend, who's looking for work.
"How do you eat?" I ask.
"Right now, I'm not doing a whole lot of that," she replies.
Despite her troubles, Ms. DeCroix is still a passionate believer in the Disney Way. She has even worked as a trainer, showing new employees how to dress, present themselves, and live up to the ethic that Walt created. "The Disney Way means that, if you see a piece of trash, you automatically bend over and pick it up, without breaking step," she explains. That is, it means doing everything you can to maintain the magic. Walt believed in family, and he wanted the company to be like family. The deal was that, if you took care of guests, then Disney would take care of you.
"Being a cast member used to mean something," Ms. DeCroix says. But not any more. The problem isn't just the lousy pay. It's the crummy break room for the drivers, with its cramped eating quarters; and the bathroom, with its poor ventilation and resulting aroma. It's the new generation of managers, who pass out more discipline than praise. It's the kind of people the company is taking on these days. "It used to be that they hired people who loved Disney and wanted to be there," she says. "Now, they hire just anybody. That's not what Walt wanted."
Last month, she became a union steward, and now gives the other drivers tips on how to make their jobs easier while making sure they follow the rules. She knows the unions are relatively toothless. In its latest labour settlement, Disney agreed to raise its starting wage to $10 by 2016 (it's $8.03 right now) - a move the local media described as a major breakthrough for the workers. But Ms. DeCroix doesn't think so; Disney is also determined to cut back pension benefits.
"I really try," she says. "I believe in what I do. I believe in helping create the magic. I know how it's supposed to be, and I still try to keep it that way. And it's really hard, considering that they don't care about me any more."
The Larrys and the geezers
Florida is a good place to retire, but it's not necessarily a good place to work. People are flocking here from all over in search of a better life. The newest arrivals are the Puerto Ricans, and the competition for low-wage jobs is fierce. I learned how fierce when I met a man I'll call Larry Sampson, a 56-year-old African-American who moved down here from Chicago around 15 years ago. He had steady work as a meat cutter and a security guard; but 10 months ago, he lost his job and has been looking for another one ever since.
Mr. Sampson has applied for hundreds of jobs, and the fact he has lost all his teeth is probably not an asset in an interview. But the real problem is his age. People look at him and figure younger folks will work for less. "In my last job, I made $16 an hour," he tells me. "Now I'd be happy to make $12, but a lot of people tell me, 'We don't pay $12 here. We pay $8 to $10.' " So now, if they ask on a job application about his salary expectations, he doesn't answer.
Mr. Sampson is proud of his work experience. He liked being a security guard. He has a picture of himself, looking stern, in his uniform. But people don't care about experience. They care only about hiring the cheapest person they can get.
In the hierarchy of American workers, he is at the very bottom of the totem pole. Median incomes for the lowest-paid workers have been plummeting for 20 years. And males of his age have the highest unemployment rate of any demographic. To put it bluntly, the Larrys of America are screwed.
"I like to work," he says. "All my life I've worked." And then he starts to cry.
Florida has a lot more going for it than do the ailing industrial rust-belt states of the north. It has sun. It has global tourism. It has global capital parked in real estate. It has no state income tax, and offers big concessions to companies, like Hertz, that want to relocate from the chilly, hightax north. (The fact that Hertz's chief executive already had a luxury condo in Naples, only a half-hour's drive from the new headquarters, is a complete coincidence.)
Florida still has lots and lots of swampland just waiting to be developed. And, of course, it has seniors - wave upon wave of geezers from the north who want to spend their golden years, or at least their winters, basking in the sun. Plenty of those geezers are well-heeled. They need houses, health care, pool cleaners, lawn cutters, vodka, suntan lotion, financial services, and, ultimately, retirement homes and funerals. And the silver tsunami has barely begun.
The Gulf town of Cape Coral is just another 20 minutes north of Naples's tasteful luxe, and a twoand-a-half hour drive across the empty swamp and scrub of central Florida from Miami's glitz. But in reality it is oceans away from both - a lumpenbourgeoisie kind of place, where an efficiency room at the Hideaway Hotel goes for $89 a night. Cheap rental units line the canals that poke long fingers through the town. You can pick up a decent three-bedroom bungalow for $150,000, which is 60 per cent of what it was worth in in 2006 but twice what it could fetch in 2009.
I ran into a ruddy-faced retired couple in their late 60s in a busy open-air restaurant by the ocean, where they were enjoying cigarettes and a few Sundaymorning vodkas. A few years ago, they retired down here from Illinois, where they both had had government jobs. Their guaranteed pensions, I figure, probably give them an annual income of close to $100,000. They like it that there's no state tax. If he were a young man trying to support a family today, said the husband, he'd be stressed.
I felt like saying, "No kidding. The state of Illinois is going broke because of the overly generous pensions it has agreed to pay people like you, and it's the younger generation that will be stuck with the tab." Like Larry Sampson, some of those young people are moving to Florida to find work, because they have no future in Illinois. But, of course, I was way too polite to say that.
Because there's an election on, I asked them about politics.
"We're seniors. We don't give a shit," he says.
"They're all crooks," she adds, echoing a sentiment voiced by many.
You can forgive them for being cynics - Florida state politics is a clown show that would make you laugh if it weren't so crazily moronic. Like a lot of people in this state, they don't care for Obama either, or Obamacare, or anything else that emanates from Washington.
The foreclosure rebound
Forty-five minutes straight inland from Cape Coral is a giant tract of land known as Lehigh Acres. This was the epicentre of the American real-estate bust, and I wanted to find out what's happened there since.
Lehigh Acres was the original Florida swampland - thousands and thousands of acres of scrub and brush that was sold off to gullible northerners for 10 bucks per lot. But by the early 2000s it was a frenzy of construction. Thousands of cheap, shoddily built houses made with toxic Chinese drywall sprouted overnight. The banks lent money to anybody, no job or credit record required.
House prices soared, and ordinary folks began speculating like crazy. They bought more houses to flip them, or used their homes as cash machines to buy boats and cars and Caribbean cruises. Then, everything went bust. In April of 2007, Lee County, which includes Cape Coral and Lehigh Acres, had the highest foreclosure rate in the entire nation. For a while, there were a thousand foreclosures a day.
The construction business vanished, and so did jobs. The hapless, the reckless and the blameless were all swept away. Criminals moved into the abandoned houses. Thieves tore the air conditioners from vacant houses, and stole the copper wiring. "If you go out there, take a gun," someone tells me.
It isn't all that bad. Although some houses are still derelict or boarded up, even Lehigh Acres is coming back. Big investors bought up many of the foreclosures, rented them out for a few years, and dribbled them back on the market for a tidy profit. Experts said it would take at least a decade for the overhang to clear, but they were too pessimistic. And I found that for every loser, there's a winner. People who couldn't afford to buy a house before are now homeowners.
The last road in Lehigh Acres runs into a wall of scrub. The last house on that road, to my surprise, was a gracious Caribbean-style villa built of wood, with a broad, welcoming veranda. It was the nicest house in the whole place. It's owned by a computer-systems installer who bought it for a song when the market collapsed. I asked him what had happened to all the people who lost their homes. He didn't know.
Work, poverty and 'positivity'
If there's one common denominator that unites all the people I met in Florida - rich and poor, left and right, old and young - it is their deep distrust of government. Most think their politicians are bought and paid for by powerful outside interests, and they are largely right. America is sliding from democracy to oligarchy, political thinkers such as Princeton's Martin Gilens say. "Our analyses suggest that majorities of the American public actually have little influence over the policies our government adopts," he writes.
In the past decade, Americans have seen their leaders massively fail in almost everything they promised to deliver. The Bushies promised nation-building and regime change, and delivered chaos. Barack Obama promised Obamacare, and he couldn't even get that right. Americans have lost faith in the skills of government to make their lives better.
In fact, nobody in the political class has practical solutions for what ails America. Politicians cannot reverse the tide of globalization, and they can't bring back the industrial economy. The class stratification that you see in Florida is spreading. The jet-setters at the top are increasingly detached from what goes on below them.
Yet, I believe the real problem isn't the 0.1 per cent guzzling Champagne around the pool - or even the hard-core underclass, who have no skills, no work habits and no prospect of acquiring them. The very rich and very poor will always be with us.
The real challenge is the working poor - folks like Kathy DeCroix and Larry Sampson, whose incomes are lower, in real terms, than they were in 2000. They are the biggest losers in today's red-in-tooth-and-claw society. If you work hard for years and still can't make a living wage, then the social contract is broken.
For folks a little further up the ladder, life also remains precarious. In Florida, young adults are studying like crazy so that they can qualify for jobs in the booming field of health care - jobs that pay $30 or $40 an hour instead of $14. But even health care can't soak up everyone. The Florida of the future will be increasingly segmented into a caste system of the wealthy; the folks who supply services to the wealthy (security, pool cleaning); the vast army of medical technicians who run the labs and MRI machines; and the $10an-hour tourism and hospitality class.
Yet, even though the inequality is striking, I didn't sense any resentment toward the rich. Kathy and Larry are not about to join the Occupy movement. Kathy does not resent the families who pack the buses to Disney World and drop more in a day than she makes in a week. She just wants them to be happy.
Above all, Americans still believe in the promise of free enterprise. You get the feeling here that everyone has something on the side - something that might help them hit the jackpot, or improve their lot or at least reinvent themselves. There's the condo concierge who organizes jazz festivals and brings in Hispanic musicians from South America. (He gave me his card.) There's the charming server at a fashionable restaurant, who told me he's only a part-time waiter, because his real job is selling real estate. (He gave me his card, too.)
Even Ms. DeCroix has a sideline. She sells Tupperware. Despite her disillusion, she is incredibly big on self-improvement and "positivity." Next year, she plans to take a course in theatre lighting so that she can get a better job. She says she'll find the money for it somehow.

The back story
In the late 1800s, an aspiring farmer by the name of Quarrie became the first homesteader on an expanse of land in the rolling hills of Wellington County north of Guelph. Mr. Quarrie and his wife named their domain Maple Ridge Farm and had a house built of local fieldstone in 1889.
The bank barn was built in 1879 or 1876, says the current owner, John Van de Kamer. He explains he's not sure which as he points to the spot - just under the peaked roof - where someone long ago proudly hand-carved the date of construction on the side of the barn. The last numeral is either a backwards nine or an upside-down six.
Lore passed down through the many years since says that Mrs. Quarrie thought the laneway would benefit from rows of trees on either side, so she set to work herself planting the Norway Spruce that still line the long drive. The columns are 85 or 90 years old, estimates Mr. Van de Kamer, who has counted the rings on the occasional fallen tree.
Mr. Van de Kamer believes the land stayed in the Quarrie family until the mid-1970s, but they deserted the farm some time in the 1950s for reasons that remain unknown. The lengthy drive, enclosed by Mrs. Quarrie's towering trees, became a lovers' lane.
In the 1970s, a new owner named Cy Wylie took over the land and brought the abandoned house back to life. In the intervening years, only a single squirrel has managed to make its way in. Mr. Wylie restored the farmhouse and added a coach house, horse barn, riding arena and driving shed.
By the mid-1980s, an elderly Mr. Wylie was finding it difficult to keep up with the farm. Mr. Van de Kamer's research shows that he sold it to a young couple by the name of Williamson who extensively renovated the house with a new roof, additional rooms, modern bathrooms and a new kitchen.
But tragedy struck and Mr. Williamson died at a young age before the house was finished. Mrs. Williamson could no longer afford to keep the property and, in desperation, she sold the farm to an institution that planned to build two-storey residences around the big pond for use as halfway houses. The old stone house would become the organization's headquarters.
The surrounding community did not take well to the idea of turning agricultural land into a setting for halfway houses, Mr. Van de Kamer explains. Neighbours launched a court battle and won; the farm was preserved.
The farm today
"I always wanted to be a farmer," says Mr. Van de Kamer, who - until the 1990s - was a media and publishing executive.
In 1992, he retired as president and chief executive officer of Montreal-based Telemedia Inc. and bought a farmhouse in Acton with his wife, Ann.
In 1992, the couple got lost during a drive around tiny Fergus and ended up at the long driveway leading to Maple Ridge Farm.
"We came up the laneway gingerly to see the stone farmhouse," he says.
The unfinished farm had lots of potential, he recalls, so the couple purchased it and set out to refurbish it for themselves and their three children.
Today the house has been expanded far beyond the original footprint. There's a large, open kitchen with a brick fireplace and raised hearth. The family room has French doors leading to the patio overlooking the pond. The dining room has an original exterior stone wall and the living room still has the antique glass in the Victorian-era windows.
The addition includes a large master suite with an ensuite bathroom and a private balcony above the swimming pond. There's also a sunroom, a large entertainment room and an elevator that glides between floors.
The old bank barn still stands near the rustic wooden chicken coop.
Mr. Van de Kamer raised thoroughbred cattle and the bank barn sheltered many young calves. In another newer barn, he points out the corner where he would sleep during calving season - ready to help the cows in labour.
"We were in the purebred business," he explained on a recent Friday, as the last cattle drive took place under his watch. The 13 cows and 13 calves were herded into trailers and sent off to be sold by auction to farmers who value their bloodlines.
"You want a cow that's absolutely purebred," he says. "You want those genetics."
Maple Ridge Farm also has a full horse riding arena. The equestrian barn has stalls for 10 horses.
Beside the main house, a twobedroom coach house provides living space over a four-bay garage.
The surrounding land has a large pond stocked with trout. A bridge leads to the island in the centre. Mr. Van de Kamer had a smaller pond dug for family swimming. Walking and riding trails wind throughout the property.
Mr. Van de Kamer recalls first wanting to be a farmer when he was a young teenager. While other kids were going to camp, he went to work with a farmer who practised mixed farming. As a young man, he thought that he might pursue a life on the farm but his wife was skeptical so he put the plan on hold.
When he bought Maple Ridge Farm, Mr. Van de Kamer decided he should start with the most gentle breed of cattle. He ended up with a herd of polled Herefords.
"I liked the fact that these were docile creatures."
He learned by surrounding himself with sage advice.
"When you grow up not at your daddy's knee, you'd better learn to listen."
Now that he has spent many years in the business, Mr. Van de Kamer's cows have won ribbons.
"The nice thing about farming is you can make a mistake and it will turn out alright."
A tradition has grown up around the annual apple day, when friends and family converge on the farm to help with apple pressing and play in the hay mounds. Mr. Van de Kamer customarily takes up to 30 kids out on tractor rides.
"Everybody goes home with a big bag of apples, cider and a stomach filled with hot dogs," he says.
Near the house, a dry-stacked fire stack is surrounded by stones.
"Each one represents a member of the family," Mr. Van de Kamer says.
He's also had a family-style golf course fashioned out of a long expanse of lawn.
The best feature
The bank barn is a rarity in an area where many have fallen into ruin or been torn down through the years.
"The barn hadn't been used in 50 years," says Mr. Van de Kamer, who brought in a team of Mennonite carpenters to restore it. It became a sturdy, comfortable place for sheltering young calves, he says.
Recently, it was nominated for an award recognizing the finest, oldest working barns in the county. It ended up in second place.
"A dairy guy beat me out," says Mr. Van de Kamer with a smile.

Abstract: The government boasted last week that Wednesday's launch of its Spring Repeal Day (it's spring down there, remember) has moved "to repeal nearly 1,000 pieces and more than 7,200 pages of legislation and regulation," after its 2014 Autumn Repeal Day earlier this year "repealed over 10,000 pieces and 50,000 pages of legislation and regulation. This brings the total net deregulatory savings to date to over $2.1-billion."

Full text:   Australia's war on red tape
Joe Hockey went out for a bite of pizza and ended up choking on red tape. The Australian Treasurer - that's finance minister to you and me - related the tale to business owners in a speech on Wednesday about the government's efforts to slash overregulation it believes is holding back the economy.
Apparently Mr. Hockey stopped by his local pizzeria with another family to enjoy a slice on the patio, when the owner told him he wasn't allowed to push two tables together because of local council rules, the Sydney Morning Herald reported.
Then, after going inside to fetch an extra chair for the group, he was told regulations allowed for only seven chairs on the patio. That's when Mr. Hockey, in his own words, "exploded."
"I actually tracked down the mayor. It was six o'clock on a Friday night, and I think the whole suburb heard the conversation," he said.
The government boasted last week that Wednesday's launch of its Spring Repeal Day (it's spring down there, remember) has moved "to repeal nearly 1,000 pieces and more than 7,200 pages of legislation and regulation," after its 2014 Autumn Repeal Day earlier this year "repealed over 10,000 pieces and 50,000 pages of legislation and regulation. This brings the total net deregulatory savings to date to over $2.1-billion."
Joe Sixpack would be proud.
The numbers don't lie, do they?
Amid the white noise of business commentary, it can be hard to get a bead on what's actually going on - that's why it's wise to rely on hard data.
But as Greenlight Capital president David Einhorn warns in Business Insider, even that can be tricky ground to navigate, illustrating his point with a chart examining U.S. spending on live entertainment. That spending happens to shows a pretty tight correlation with the number of people who die falling out of their wheelchairs.
The upshot? Don't spend on live entertainment if you're in a wheelchair, wear a seat belt in your wheelchair if you do, or just take a lot of correlations with a pinch of salt. Just to be on the safe side, Disclosures is doing all three.
Detroit really is this guy's hometown
In Detroit, pretty much anywhere Herb Strather lays his hat is his home. On Tuesday, the city completed its auction of more than 6,000 parcels of "blighted" properties, with the whole lot going to a single unidentified buyer.
Well, unidentified for a day, at least. The winning bidder was Mr. Strather, a local casino and real estate developer, The Detroit News reported, who scooped up a total of 6,350 properties for $3,183,500 (U.S.). That works out to $501.39 apiece.
About a thousand of them are in good shape, 3,000 require demolishing, and about 2,000 are vacant lots. Under the terms of the auction, Mr. Strather will have to put the wrecking ball to the worst of them in six months, work expected to cost more than $24-million, Bloomberg Business-week reported.
Conditions attached to the sale require Mr. Strather to come up with a redevelopment plan the city can live with, or the properties revert to the city.
But the developer seems unfazed by that, and has nothing but enthusiasm for the deal. "Right now," he says, "I am so excited my toes are wiggling."
Next up is the city's auction of unneeded municipal vehicles to be held Nov. 5 and Nov. 13. Mark the dates in your calendar for a chance to pick up "garbage trucks, aerial bucket lift trucks, lift trucks, digger trucks, grapple trucks, backhoes and much more" at prices that can't be beat. (All sales final.)
Cliffs CEO snubs analyst
Are CEOs getting a bit tetchy lately, or is it just me? Last week a few analyst eyebrows were raised when it appeared Rogers CEO Guy Laurence was taking a shot at Canaccord Genuity analyst Dvai Ghose in a conference call over comments he had made about the company's results. Turns out it was all in jest, as Streetwise's Niall McGee explained, and Mr. Ghose laughed off the reaction.
But a Tuesday morning exchange between Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. CEO Lourenco Goncalves and Wells Fargo analyst Sam Dubinsky was bit more prickly, as Business Insider reported. Mr. Dubinsky has an "underperform" rating on the stock and a target range of $4 (U.S.) to $7 (it was trading around $11 on Thursday afternoon), based in part on the company signalling it wants out of its investments in Ontario's Ring of Fire region.
It all started out so politely, with Mr. Dubinsky thanking Mr. Goncalves for taking his question, and then Mr. Goncalves responding by thanking Mr. Dubinsky for saying thank you. The CEO then added he wouldn't answer his questions because you "already know everything about my company. You have a $4 price target, and we think we can sell assets. So I'm going to take the next question, I'm not going to answer you. Next question, operator, please."
You want it to look like a what?
China may be undergoing an economic slowdown, but its propensity for offbeat architecture appears unabated. So much so, in fact, that President Xi Jinping has made it clear he's not a fan of the current spate of one-upmanship in the weirdness stakes that has gripped the country's developers.
During an unusual appearance at a literary symposium in Beijing this week, the President gave a two-hour address that talked about how art should serve the people.
He called for morally inspiring art that should "be like sunshine from the blue sky and the breeze in spring that will inspire minds, warm hearts, cultivate taste, and clean up undesirable work styles," according to a translation by the WSJ. And he doesn't appear to feel buildings that look like a teapot, a piano/violin, a coin, a Slinky or a pair of pants fit the bill.
The worst offender may well be the headquarters of the People's Daily newspaper, the state's official organ, that looks like, er, a giant organ. Perhaps it's a comment on the journalists working inside.

Full text:   Toronto may have elected a brand-new mayor, but most of the 44 city councillors voters chose Monday are familiar faces, with only one incumbent up for re-election, one-time Ford supporter John Parker, going down to defeat.
Many high-profile incumbents facing serious challengers were returned to office. In the end, there will be seven new faces on council, most of whom claimed seats left vacant by departing or retiring veterans.
However, mayor-elect John Tory should find plenty of votes for his agenda. For the most part, city council's political makeup remains the same, with more than a dozen conservatives and a large "mushy middle" of centrists likely to support Mr. Tory, plus a dozen or so left-leaning councillors expected to be more critical. But with the polarizing Rob Ford out of the mayor's chair, many expect councillors of all stripes to take a more collaborative approach.
Rob Ford, however, will still be at City Hall, but back in his old role as a city councillor. He won the Etobicoke council seat that had been occupied by his brother, Doug, who took over the trail of the mayoral campaign after Rob was diagnosed with cancer.
The only defeated incumbent is Mr. Parker, who lost his seat in Ward 26. The erudite former Progressive Conservative MPP, elected to council in 2006, initially sided with Mr. Ford but later broke with him. He was defeated by local entrepreneur Jon Burnside, who enjoyed Mr. Tory's endorsement.
Paula Fletcher, the left-leaning incumbent in Ward 30, Toronto-Danforth, handily fended off a two-front challenge from activist Jane Farrow and TV personality Liz West, whom Ms. Fletcher only narrowly defeated in 2010.
"I hope [Mr. Tory] does count on the experience that a number of us have at city hall and that we won't have another four years like the last four years," Ms. Fletcher told CBC Radio on Monday night.
The controversial councillor Giorgio Mammoliti, who has represented Ward 7, held onto his seat with a 10-percentagepoint edge despite facing a three-month suspension from council and a police probe over an $80,000 fundraiser.
In an acrimonious race in Beaches-East York, Ward 32, Mary-Margaret McMahon easily held off a challenge from the councillor she defeated in 2010, Sandra Bussin.
In Davenport, councillors Cesar Palacio, Ward 17, and Ana Bailao, Ward 18, both held onto their seats despite strong challengers. So did former Ford budget chief Frank Di Giorgio, who fended off former Liberal MP and mayoral candidate John Nunziata in Ward 12, York-South Weston.
Most of the new faces came in wards without incumbents. NDP strategist Joe Cressy won easily in Ward 20, Trinity-Spadina, which had been vacated by Adam Vaughan.
Former Liberal MP Jim Karygiannis won Ward 39 in Scarborough, where Michael Del Grande, who also served as Mr. Ford's budget chief, stepped down.
In Ward 3 in Etobicoke, the winner was Stephen Holyday, the son of the former councillor, Doug Holyday. The seat vacated by mayoral race dropout Karen Stintz, Ward 16 Eglinton-Lawrence, went to Christin Carmichael Greb, daughter of Toronto federal Tory MP John Carmichael. Replacing retiring councillor Gloria Lindsay Luby in Ward 4 in Etobicoke is marketing adviser John Campbell. Real-estate executive Justin Di Ciano took Ward 5, which Peter Milczyn left vacant to become a Liberal MP.

While cottagers may be sad to see summer end, house hunters will be happy to head back to school. That is, a former educational institute that McMurray Street Investments Inc. will convert into a loft project anchoring a new master-planned community in Bracebridge.
"This is the first of its kind in Muskoka," marketing manager Sarah Davies says.
"It has a little bit of everything for everybody ... whether you have a cottage and want to downsize and don't want the maintenance of a cottage any more ... or whether you're in the city and you don't want to spend $2-million on a lakefront home."
The Toronto-based developer, John Davies - who has a place in Muskoka - will create 90 suites within the old Bracebridge high school and three new low-rises on McMurray Street in the heart of the small town, about 90 minutes north of Toronto.
"A lot of people were nostalgic about their old school," Ms. Davies states. "Other than local [interest], we've had a great response: the finishings are fantastic, the suite designs are great and there's lot of outdoor and amenity space."
For instance, the original brick structure will be refurbished with modern suites and recreational facilities, such as a fireside lounge, virtual golf simulator, gym and resistance pool.
An adjacent building, known as the Library North Residences, will provide a rooftop terrace and party room with a lounge, bar, kitchen, dining and games area.
"The amenities alone are fantastic," Ms. Davies states. "The schoolhouse and library buildings will be connected via a bridge and all other units have access through the parking garage."
Residents will also be close to restaurants, shops and services, as well as golf courses and waterfront parks and beach. "We're about one block away from the main strip in Bracebridge," Ms. Davies adds.
"[Plus] we're the waterfall capital of Canada, so there are tons of waterfalls to visit and hiking, biking and snowmobiling trails. Pretty much anything you want to do outside, you can do in Bracebridge."
The 85-year-old schoolhouse, which was vacated several years ago, is a three-storey structure with brick walls and 10- to 14-foot ceilings. "I love the character of the schoolhouse with the exposed brick, high ceilings and wooden beams. That kind of stuff is very cool and it's something we don't have in Muskoka."
Gabriel Bodor Architect Inc. will give a country modern feel to the new additions, which will encompass the Grove Residences and Library Residences, which will be a four-storey building and pair of five-storey structures respectively.
The Library Residences will feature conventional one- and twobedroom suites, while the Grove Residences will also offer two-storey units with balconies and rooftop terraces accessed from fireside Muskoka rooms.
"The Grove is quite unique because of the amount of outdoor space," Ms. Davies says. "And some units in the Grove building have private elevator access into your suite, which is a really cool feature we've added."
Bryon Patton and Associates will oversee interior appointments, such as marble, ceramic, porcelain and laminate flooring; granite or quartz kitchen counters; and stainless-steel appliances.
Units will come with monthly fees of 42 cents a square foot, plus a locker and one parking spot owing an extra $7 and $23 respectively monthly. Second parking stall will cost $20,000.
Occupancy will begin fall 2016.

Full text:   In an election season dominated by hard-fought 905 contests in Mississauga and Brampton, the mayoral race in Halton Hills, a rural community north of Milton that includes Georgetown, has morphed into a bitter showdown between a long-serving incumbent and a challenger whose controversial stake in a decommissioned local quarry has proven to be more than just a tempest in a gravel pit.
Sally Stull, a Town of Erin planner whose husband hauls construction debris and clean fill to a former gravel pit they own in the area, is challenging Rick Bonnette, a 32-year council veteran who has been Halton Hills' mayor for 11 years.
Ms. Stull says she's running to push a "long-in-the-tooth" council to adapt to development pressures and traffic in a community of almost 60,000 residents. But her candidacy has reignited a fierce local fight - which has played out at the Ontario Municipal Board, council and now in the courts - over attempts by her and her husband to infill a long-dormant quarry and operate an aggregate facility on the property. The 67-acre site, which abuts some rural homes, is located just a few hundred metres away from several Georgetown subdivisions.
The showdown comes at a time when several 905 municipalities are grappling with what to do with the mountains of excavated material flowing out of Toronto and into decommissioned quarries in rural areas around Greater Toronto. Residents in areas such as King, Pickering and Scugog are upset about dump-truck traffic along rural roads, as well as threats to groundwater if some of the "clean fill" contains toxic substances such as benzene, motor oil or other hydrocarbons.
Critics say the province hasn't properly regulated clean-fill brokers, who are paid to haul soil and inert debris off construction sites, while developers and municipal contractors scramble to find landfills that will accept the material.
Some 905 municipalities in recent years have passed highly restrictive dumping bylaws, which have forced haulers to look further afield or deal with shady operators, according to Earthroots campaigner Josh Garfinkel.
"There's all this dirt coming out of the ground and no one's tracking where it's going," he says. "What's too dirty for the City of Toronto is being dumped adjacent to valuable water sources and farmland. It's a huge policy gap in terms of lack of monitoring."
The booming clean-fill industry, linked as it is to Greater Toronto Area development, is worth millions of dollars for haulers and pit owners. "On Highway 27 coming north, it's basically like a train of dump trucks," observes Greg Locke, who is running for King Township council and has campaigned to stop this kind of dumping.
In Halton Hills, the quarry at the centre of the dispute has been dormant for 25 years, and the province formally revoked the licence in 2006. According to Elizabeth Doell, a real estate agent who lives nearby, the property, which included two ponds, had been regenerated with trees and other plant life.
But in 2012, after the land was quietly rezoned, Rick and Sally Stull, who own the site, stripped the plant life, drained one of the ponds and began hauling fill into the site. Ms. Doell calculated that about 13,000 truckloads arrived at the property over a four-month period before the town obtained an injunction to shut it down.
Council blocked the Stulls' application for an exemption to a "site alteration" policy that would allow the site to be used as an aggregate transfer station.
The Stulls objected to the town's land-use decisions, and an Ontario court will rule on the case next March. But the simmering two-year-old controversy has become an election issue. "The fact that she's running for mayor is adding insult to injury," says Ms. Doell, who adds that she's concerned about the potential of contaminated well water.
Ms. Stull, however, defends her actions and claims that the attacks are politically motivated. She says her husband's company obtained test results for any fill that came onto the property, which is adjacent to farmland owned by the couple. "We get soil analysis before we get the material," she adds, noting that the fill came from greenfield development projects in Brampton.
But she concedes that they plan to bring in 100 truckloads of fill each weekday for the next three to five years.
Ms. Stull has also been accused of conflict of interest because she wrote and administered the clean-fill bylaw for the Town of Erin, where she works as the municipal planner. The municipality ruled that Ms. Stull is not in a conflict position because her family's fill business doesn't operate within Erin, which is about 20 kilometres west of Halton Hills. "I have no, shall I say, influence with regard [to] council's choice to change the bylaw."

Full text:   Matthew Kennedy is a young man many people would consider to be the equivalent of a unicorn in Vancouver. This is, after all, the city renowned in popular mythology as a place with such astronomical house prices that its young will be forced to live in basement suites forever.
Mr. Kennedy bought his first condo four years ago when he was 20, using the money he had saved from the jobs he started right after he finished high school. The first one, at H&R Block, doing deliveries. The second, doing what his father had done and he'd loved since a kid, painting cars.
He put 10 per cent down on the $265,000 two-bedroom suite in Langley, B.C. He only needed his parents' help because the bank was antsy about him being so young. They lent him another 10 per cent, which he repaid. (His parents, with four other children and no Vancouver west-side house to cash out of, don't have money to burn.)
Mr. Kennedy, who has since married, is now looking for a slightly larger place to buy, a townhouse, with plans to rent out the original condo.
"It was a lot of work," says Mr. Kennedy, who paid rent to his parents while he was saving for his first down payment. "There's definitely sacrifices. I budgeted. I didn't eat out. Some could say I missed some life experiences. But if you have that [home ownership] as your goal, anything is possible."
Mr. Kennedy, as it turns out, is not as rare as many might think.
A recent analysis of home-ownership rates in Canada done by Vancouver-based Urban Futures shows that the proportion of young homeowners increased from 2006 to 2011, a period when prices appeared to be climbing out of reach in many urban centres, including Toronto, Calgary and Ottawa.
"The headlines that portray the current younger generation as being more challenged than previous younger generations to enter the owned side of the housing market are balanced by the data that show continued increase in home ownership rates among young age groups," the report said.
Home-ownership rates among younger people in B.C.'s Lower Mainland went up more than the national average. Vancouver homeowners in the 20- to 24year-old age bracket increased four percentage points, to 25 per cent, in those five years - putting young Vancouverites near the top of the list among Canadian cities in proportion of homeowners under 25. The rate went up to 37 per cent from 35 among those 25-29.
It stayed around 50 per cent for the 30- to 34-year-olds.
As a result, about a third of people under 30 in the Lower Mainland own homes. That's about 10 percentage points lower than in Calgary, but the same as the proportion in Toronto, says Andrew Ramlo, a director at Urban Futures.
UBC's Sauder School of Business professor Tsur Somerville says part of the reason for Vancouver's high rate of young homeowners is that the proliferation of condos and townhouses here gives them a lower-priced product to choose from compared with other cities that are dominated by houses. And they likely feel more pressured to buy early, because, like everyone else in the city, they worry they'll be priced out if they don't buy now.
Mr. Ramlo acknowledged that some of the home-ownership patterns in Vancouver are puzzling, given the disparity between incomes of young people and house prices.
An analysis of local incomes released last week by researcher and urban planner Andrew Yan, who works with Bing Thom Architects, showed that 25- to 55year-olds with BAs in Vancouver make about $41,000 a year, $10,000 a year less than the median for Canada and $20,000 less than in top-paying Ottawa.
The spread was even worse for people with master's degrees.
"The relationship between incomes and prices of homes has totally broken down here," Mr. Ramlo said. He, like others, said part of the explanation has to be that parents, who benefited from the last several decades of real estate appreciation, are transferring their wealth to their children.
But that's not all. It's clear from talking to young people who are buying homes in the expensive Lower Mainland that they're also strategizing how to crack the market on their own.
Siblings or friends will buy an apartment together until they've built up enough equity to sell and take their proceeds to buy their own dwellings. They'll buy a condo in a suburb that's affordable and rent it out to build up equity, while they continue to live in the central city. They'll definitely make do with less space.
Because it's equally clear that they've decided they're going to buy in, no matter what. Despite what many say about the young being driven out of the Lower Mainland, they've decided they're not leaving.
"People I know here couldn't imagine going somewhere else," said Kent Maier, 31, who just closed this month on a near$400,000 condo a few blocks from St. Paul's hospital downtown. Mr. Maier, a federal government employee and his partner, Fabian Gutierrez, an immigration consultant in training, came from Edmonton a year ago and say they are never returning to that city, no matter what the house prices are there. "Most people I know are buying or planning to buy. Prices are high but they're not going to change and you might as well get in."
For Jordan O'Donnell and husband Chris Richards - she works as a specialized tutor, he is a social-media consultant at the Vancouver airport - buying became an emotional decision about moving to a new life phase.
"This was the first step of being an adult," said Mr. Richards, 30, who said he and his 29-year-old wife chose Richmond because that's where they grew up and where their parents still live.
They saved enough for most of the 20-per-cent down payment needed for their $300,000 townhouse - "a real fixer-upper, 43 years old, near Garden City and Williams" - and got over the hump with the help of Ms.
O'Donnell's father. (That saved them extra costs that get tacked onto a mortgage with a lessthan-20-per-cent down payment.)
Some young homeowners have become slightly evangelical about the need for others to realize it's possible if they stop being so clueless about money.
Eesmyal Santos-Brault, a greenbuilding consultant, bought his first condo 10 years ago when he was 28 and working at a non-profit for near minimum wage.
He didn't think he'd even qualify for a mortgage, but his mother, a real estate agent, told him just to try. She also offered to lend him the $7,000 he needed for the minimum down payment on a Commercial Drive condo.
"She kept pushing me even though I was saying: 'I can't qualify, I'm poor, I'm just a kid.' " To his surprise, he found the bank would indeed lend him money.
"I keep telling all my artsy, environmental friends that they should do this," says Mr. SantosBrault, who has since bought a townhouse in Strathcona while renting out the condo.
And he worries that people - those in certain fields who believe they're above talking about money or who come from lower socio-economic backgrounds - are handicapped by the attitudes they've inherited from their families or social circle.
"They don't know anyone who owns, they don't understand money, they just don't think it's possible. I keep telling them: 'It's a conspiracy to keep you as renters. Then you can pay someone else's mortgage.' "

Vienna's new opulence: Elegant hotel is at the hub of the developing Goldenes Quartier, steps away from new boutiques and centuries-old restaurants

Abstract: You can't get more central that Am Hof 2, the Hyatt's address on the city's oldest square. It's within easy walking distance to St. Stephan's cathedral, the Hofburg Palace and the Kohlmarkt, the city's homegrown high-end jewellery district. As the hub of the Goldenes Quartier, it's also within steps of a dozen of Vienna's newest boutiques, and some of its more revered standbys, such as Zum Schwarzen Kameel, a restaurant established in 1618.

Full text:   The new Hyatt in Vienna is a big deal in more ways than one. It is, first, a hotel of extreme elegance, built into a gorgeous old bank building in a location that's both central and close to little alleyways with restaurants and bars that feel like discoveries when you stumble upon them.
But the Hyatt also represents a big change for a city that's experienced very little of it since the Habsburgs moved out of their palaces.
Vienna might be described as indie elegant. The cafés, the shops, and even the hotels have been sui generis , sophisticated in their own marble-and-gilt, highceilinged, Old World style. The city has been mostly free of highend multinational chains. The new Goldenes Quartier is looking to change that. It's one of the most valuable chunks of the old city, and it's named, owned and developed by one man with a mission, 37-year-old real estate magnate René Benko.
LOCATION, LOCATION
You can't get more central that Am Hof 2, the Hyatt's address on the city's oldest square. It's within easy walking distance to St. Stephan's cathedral, the Hofburg Palace and the Kohlmarkt, the city's homegrown high-end jewellery district. As the hub of the Goldenes Quartier, it's also within steps of a dozen of Vienna's newest boutiques, and some of its more revered standbys, such as Zum Schwarzen Kameel, a restaurant established in 1618.
IF I COULD CHANGE ONE THING
I know everything's all Euro these days, but why would the hotel designer use Coco Chanel's Paris studio as inspiration for the Pearl Bar's main focal point, its eye-catching staircase? Vienna has a monumental cultural history of its own to draw on, and if I were Viennese, I'd probably be mildly offended.
BEST AMENITY
The pool, part of the hotel's Arany Spa, is gorgeous - an art nouveau painting come to aqueous life.
WHOM YOU'LL MEET
This is now officially the fanciest hotel in a very fancy city, so expect to meet some fancy people, including jet-set business types, well-groomed young families with eerily well-behaved children, and locals hanging out in the Pearl, which has become one of the city's best cocktail bars.
DESIGN
The hotel's interior was put together by FG Stijl, a Dutch company, who used mother of pearl throughout, including in the impressive inlaid rosettes in the floor of the entryways of every room. In addition to the mother of pearl, there is judicious use of onyx and lapis lazuli. Other memorable design quirks include the golden mosaic tiles in the spa, and the very cool televisions that discreetly rise out of the mantelpieces in every room; the effect is (despite the Chanel faux pas) as Viennese as a Klimt.
EAT IN OR EAT OUT?
Definitely in. The Bank - a twostorey atrium that used to be the teller's room - is the hotel's most impressive room. And the food, by chef Stefan Resch, is not only well and creatively executed, but aggressively local, with Danube salmon, perch from nearby Lake Neusiedl and snails from Vienna's own Schneckermarkt, or snail market.
ROOM WITH A VIEW
For a $140 average price bump, the hotel offers "view" rooms that look out over the square or the sidewalks and boutiques of the Goldenes Quartier.
Vienna Park Hyatt, Am Hof 2, 1010 Vienna, Austria, vienna.park.hyatt.com. 143 rooms from about $635.

Rotterdam's new market should inspire us: Markthal blends housing and retail in a creative way, while the redesign of St. Lawrence's North Market falls flat in comparison

Imagine this: You wake up, shake last night's dream away, stretch, and then look out the window, only to be greeted by a giant snail hiding behind a mushroom. Or, perhaps you spy a massive raspberry, shrimp and flower.
No, you haven't fallen down Alice's rabbit hole. Rather, you're one of the lucky few who get to call Rotterdam's new Market Hall home, and that colourful explosion of produce, grain, insects, fungi and a snail are your constant companions (there's a cow, too). The largest art piece in the Netherlands, Horn of Plenty by Arno Coenen and Iris Roskam wraps the curving interior walls of the hall with such joy, you won't want to hang curtains.
Opened to the public just two weeks ago, MVRDV's Markthal is one of the most breathtaking food markets you'll ever explore, and not just because of the surreal wallpaper. A long, horseshoeshaped tunnel, both ends of the building are finished in soaring glass walls to allow light to rain upon the food vendors, as well as deep into subterranean levels; the thick exterior walls contain 228 apartments, most with sweeping views of the rugged port city.
In short, this is a piece of architecture that will quickly become a landmark for locals and visitors alike.
And, says MVRDV public relations chief Jan Knikker, it needs to be. Not only does Rotterdam long for even half the tourists that flock to Amsterdam (only 80 kilometres away), the historic city centre continues to work hard at shedding its 1980s reputation as one of the "drug hot spots of Europe" in order to rebrand itself as a safe, fun destination middleclass folk will live in, and, especially, shop in: "Because the Dutch people are not used to markets, there was this idea that this market needed to be bigger, but then it became a financial issue - how do we create a big building that is a market, but with the low rents that [vendors] will pay for the market-stalls?"
To complicate matters, the city's 2004 competition brief called for rental apartments, condominiums and a significant number of parking spaces (1,200) as well as an enclosed market to complement the open-air one nearby.
Eschewing the typical scheme of creating a separate building for each function, MVRDV's solution rolled these requirements into one big architectural croquette, so the walls of the market itself contain the housing units, and all parking and loading is done underground and out of sight. This novel approach took first place for the Rotterdam-based architecture firm, established in 1993 by Winy Maas, Jacob van Rijs and Nathalie de Vries.
In addition to the 96 food stalls and 20 retail units on the 43,000square-foot ground floor (for comparison, Toronto's St. Lawrence Market is 50,000 square feet according to ERA Architects), Markthal also boasts a full grocery store on the lower level, a flexible "edutainment" space, and yet another art installation beside the escalators titled "The Time Stair," where the deeper one descends, the more one learns of the site's history via archeological artifacts found during excavation, video, and sound.
Because of its low energy use and passive ventilation system, the Building Research Establishment (BRE) awarded Markthal a "Very Good" certificate. In addition, tenants must sign an agreement promising green practices regarding water consumption, waste and the use of certified construction materials; some are already using their roofs for urban farming.
Housing units range in size from approximately 850 square feet to a whopping 3,200 square feet, and all have exterior balconies. Because of the raked roof, the 24 penthouses have expansive terraces and a price tag to match; your humble Architourist walked through a tastefully decorated 1,000-square-feet model suite on the fourth floor, and an empty $1.7-million penthouse so large it could pass for an art gallery. A highlight was the penthouse atrium with a small glass floor framing ant-like people 11 storeys below. Both units had gorgeous views of the medieval Laurens church to the north, and I'm sure most south-facing units must be able to take in Rem Koolhaas's brooding De Rotterdam on Wilhelmina Pier a few kilometres away.
"A lot is happening in Rotterdam right now," Mr. Knikker says, "and it makes the city quite livable."
Which brings us to an even more livable city ... Toronto. When National Geographic awarded historic St. Lawrence Market "No. 1 food market in the world" in 2012, there were few chests that swelled larger than mine. Still, I wondered what was happening with the North Market building across the street.
To refresh your memory, a competition was held in 2010 to replace the bunker-like, late-1960s one-storey structure with something larger, and the winning design by London-based Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners (with Adamson Associates), while perhaps not an instant landmark like Markthal, was a striking building with adjustable louvers, a segmented 'floating' roof, and an overall muscular appearance.
By 2012, shovels still hadn't hit the ground, and the city released a tepid redesign that Torontoist writer Steve Kupferman called "two enormous Quonset huts on stilts." Fitting perhaps, since upper floors of this new building will house municipal courtrooms - transient, depressing spaces that won't add life or tourists.
As 2014 draws to a close and we've yet to see action, we can now demand something better. While our South Market can more than hold its own, let's take a page from Rotterdam and incorporate housing and retail into a new, better North Market building.
The alternative? Every day, we'll wake up to compromise.

Full text:   Through hard work, determination and helpful parents, these twentysomethings are proud to say they have a mortgage
Matthew Kennedy is a young man many people would consider to be the equivalent of a unicorn in Vancouver. This is, after all, the city renowned in popular mythology as a place with such astronomical house prices that its young will be forced to live in basement suites forever.
Mr. Kennedy bought his first condo four years ago when he was 20, using the money he had saved from the job he started right after he finished high school. The first one, at H & R Block, doing deliveries. The second, doing what his father had done and he'd loved since a kid, painting cars.
He put 10 per cent down on the $265,000 two-bedroom suite in Langley, B.C. He only needed his parents' help because the bank was antsy about him being so young. They lent him another 10 per cent, which he repaid. (His parents, with four other children and no Vancouver west-side house to cash out of, don't have money to burn.)
Mr. Kennedy, who has since married, is now looking for a slightly larger place to buy, a townhouse, with plans to rent out the original condo.
"It was a lot of work," says Mr. Kennedy, who paid rent to his parents while he was saving for his first down payment. "There's definitely sacrifices. I budgeted. I didn't eat out. Some could say I missed some life experiences. But if you have that [home ownership] as your goal, anything is possible."
Mr. Kennedy, as it turns out, is not as rare as many might think.
A recent analysis of home-ownership rates in Canada done by Vancouver-based Urban Futures shows that the proportion of young homeowners increased from 2006 to 2011, a period when prices appeared to be climbing out of reach in many urban centres, including Toronto, Calgary and Ottawa.
"The headlines that portray the current younger generation as being more challenged than previous younger generations to enter the owned side of the housing market are balanced by the data that show continued increase in home ownership rates among young age groups," the report said.
Home-ownership rates among younger people in B.C.'s Lower Mainland went up more than the national average. Vancouver homeowners in the 20- to 24year-old age bracket increased four percentage points, to 25 per cent, in those five years - putting young Vancouverites near the top of the list among Canadian cities in proportion of homeowners under 25. The rate went up to 37 per cent from 35 among those 25-29. It stayed around 50 per cent for the 30- to 34-year-olds.
As a result, about a third of people under 30 in the Lower Mainland own homes. That's about 10 percentage points lower than in Calgary, but the same as the proportion in Toronto, says Andrew Ramlo, a director at Urban Futures.
UBC's Sauder School of Business professor Tsur Somerville says part of the reason for Vancouver's high rate of young homeowners is that the proliferation of condos and townhouses here gives them a lower-priced product to choose from compared with other cities that are dominated by houses.
And they likely feel more pressured to buy early, because, like everyone else in the city, they worry they'll be priced out if they don't buy now.
Mr. Ramlo acknowledged that some of the home-ownership patterns in Vancouver are puzzling, given the disparity between incomes of young people and house prices.
An analysis of local incomes released last week by researcher and urban planner Andrew Yan, who works with Bing Thom Architects, showed that 25- to 55year-olds with BAs in Vancouver make about $41,000 a year, $10,000 a year less than the median for Canada and $20,000 less than in top-paying Ottawa.
The spread was even worse for people with master's degrees.
"The relationship between incomes and prices of homes has totally broken down here," Mr. Ramlo said. He, like others, said part of the explanation has to be that parents, who benefited from the last several decades of realestate appreciation, are transferring their wealth to their children.
But that's not all. It's clear from talking to young people who are buying homes in the expensive Lower Mainland that they're also strategizing how to crack the market on their own.
Siblings or friends will buy an apartment together until they've built up enough equity to sell and take their proceeds to buy their own dwellings. They'll buy a condo in a suburb that's affordable and rent it out to build up equity, while they continue to live in the central city. They'll definitely make do with less space.
Because it's equally clear that they've decided they're going to buy in, no matter what. Despite what many say about the young being driven out of the Lower Mainland, they've decided they're not leaving.
"People I know here couldn't imagine going somewhere else," said Kent Maier, 31, who just closed this month on a near$400,000 condo a few blocks from St. Paul's hospital downtown. Mr. Maier, a federal government employee and his partner, Fabian Gutierrez, an immigration consultant in training, came from Edmonton a year ago and say they are never returning to that city, no matter what the house prices are there. "Most people I know are buying or planning to buy. Prices are high but they're not going to change and you might as well get in."
For Jordan O'Donnell and husband Chris Richards - she works as a specialized tutor, he is a social-media consultant at the Vancouver airport - buying became an emotional decision about moving to a new life phase.
"This was the first step of being an adult," said Mr. Richards, 30, who said he and his 29-year-old wife chose Richmond because that's where they grew up and where their parents still live.
They saved enough for most of the 20-per-cent down payment needed for their $300,000 townhouse - "a real fixer-upper, 43 years old, near Garden City and Williams" - and got over the hump with the help of Ms. O'Donnell's father. (That saved them extra costs that get tacked onto a mortgage with a less-than-20-percent down payment.)
Some young homeowners have become slightly evangelical about the need for others to realize it's possible if they stop being so clueless about money.
Eesmyal Santos-Brault, a greenbuilding consultant, bought his first condo 10 years ago when he was 28 and working at a non-profit for near minimum wage.
He didn't think he'd even qualify for a mortgage, but his mother, a real estate agent, told him just to try. She also offered to lend him the $7,000 he needed for the minimum down payment on a Commercial Drive condo.
"She kept pushing me even though I was saying: 'I can't qualify, I'm poor, I'm just a kid.' " To his surprise, he found the bank would indeed lend him money.
"I keep telling all my artsy, environmental friends that they should do this," says Mr. SantosBrault, who has since bought a townhouse in Strathcona while renting out the condo.
And he worries that people - those in certain fields who believe they're above talking about money or who come from lower socioeconomic backgrounds - are handicapped by the attitudes they've inherited from their families or social circle.
"They don't know anyone who owns, they don't understand money, they just don't think it's possible. I keep telling them: "It's a conspiracy to keep you as renters. Then you can pay someone else's mortgage.' "

Full text:   Markthal blends housing and retail in a creative way, while the redesign of St. Lawrence's North Market falls flat in comparison
daveleblanc@globeandmail.com
Imagine this: You wake up, shake last night's dream away, stretch, and then look out the window, only to be greeted by a giant snail hiding behind a mushroom. Or, perhaps you spy a massive raspberry, shrimp and flower.
No, you haven't fallen down Alice's rabbit hole. Rather, you're one of the lucky few who get to call Rotterdam's new Market Hall home, and that colourful explosion of produce, grain, insects, fungi and a snail are your constant companions (there's a cow, too). The largest art piece in the Netherlands, Horn of Plenty by Arno Coenen and Iris Roskam wraps the curving interior walls of the hall with such joy, you won't want to hang curtains.
Opened to the public just two weeks ago, MVRDV's Markthal is one of the most breathtaking food markets you'll ever explore, and not just because of the surreal wallpaper. A long, horseshoeshaped tunnel, both ends of the building are finished in soaring glass walls to allow light to rain upon the food vendors, as well as deep into subterranean levels; the thick exterior walls contain 228 apartments, most with sweeping views of the rugged port city.
In short, this is a piece of architecture that will quickly become a landmark for locals and visitors alike.
And, says MVRDV public relations chief Jan Knikker, it needs to be. Not only does Rotterdam long for even half the tourists that flock to Amsterdam (only 80 kilometres away), the historic city centre continues to work hard at shedding its 1980s reputation as one of the "drug hot spots of Europe" in order to rebrand itself as a safe, fun destination middleclass folk will live in, and, especially, shop in: "Because the Dutch people are not used to markets, there was this idea that this market needed to be bigger, but then it became a financial issue - how do we create a big building that is a market, but with the low rents that [vendors] will pay for the market-stalls?"
To complicate matters, the city's 2004 competition brief called for rental apartments, condominiums and a significant number of parking spaces (1,200) as well as an enclosed market to complement the open-air one nearby.
Eschewing the typical scheme of creating a separate building for each function, MVRDV's solution rolled these requirements into one big architectural croquette, so the walls of the market itself contain the housing units, and all parking and loading is done underground and out of sight. This novel approach took first place for the Rotterdam-based architecture firm, established in 1993 by Winy Maas, Jacob van Rijs and Nathalie de Vries.
In addition to the 96 food stalls and 20 retail units on the 43,000square-foot ground floor (for comparison, Toronto's St. Lawrence Market is 50,000 square feet according to ERA Architects), Markthal also boasts a full grocery store on the lower level, a flexible "edutainment" space, and yet another art installation beside the escalators titled "The Time Stair," where the deeper one descends, the more one learns of the site's history via archeological artifacts found during excavation, video, and sound.
Because of its low energy use and passive ventilation system, the Building Research Establishment (BRE) awarded Markthal a "Very Good" certificate. In addition, tenants must sign an agreement promising green practices regarding water consumption, waste and the use of certified construction materials; some are already using their roofs for urban farming.
Housing units range in size from approximately 850 square feet to a whopping 3,200 square feet, and all have exterior balconies. Because of the raked roof, the 24 penthouses have expansive terraces and a price tag to match; your humble Architourist walked through a tastefully decorated 1,000-square-feet model suite on the fourth floor, and an empty $1.7-million penthouse so large it could pass for an art gallery.

Both units had gorgeous views of the medieval Laurens church to the north, and I'm sure most south-facing units must be able to take in Rem Koolhaas's brooding De Rotterdam on Wilhelmina Pier a few kilometres away.
"A lot is happening in Rotterdam right now," Mr. Knikker says, "and it makes the city quite livable."
Which brings us to an even more livable city ... Toronto. When National Geographic awarded historic St. Lawrence Market "No. 1 food market in the world" in 2012, there were few chests that swelled larger than mine. Still, I wondered what was happening with the North Market building across the street.

Earth to Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne: Your MaRS mission is looking like Apollo 13.
Instead of becoming "the world's largest innovation hub" (a metaphorical moon landing), your government's Medical and Related Sciences (MaRS) Discovery District is turning out to be a dicey salvage operation that's blowing up in taxpayers' faces.
Good luck with trying to turn this sow's ear into the "silk purse that is our economic future," as Ms. Wynne pledged last week. If Ontario's future prosperity hinges on projects like MaRS, Canada's biggest province may be in even bigger trouble than it looks.
The MaRS saga - which has one arm of the Ontario government repaying MaRS's loan from another arm of the same government on a gleaming but mostly empty office tower - is a cautionary tale of how not to do innovation policy. Top-down attempts to create "innovation hubs" almost never work, especially if they're based on trying to copy one-off successes elsewhere.
That hasn't stopped countless governments from trying. MaRS joins a long list of similarly disappointing efforts across the globe.
Duke University technology expert Vivek Wadhwa, who has studied hundreds of such hubs, concludes: "Political leaders long ago held press conferences to claim credit for advancing science and technology, management consultants earned hefty fees and real-estate barons reaped fortunes. Taxpayers were left holding the bag."
MaRS began as an idea 15 years ago, when a group of Toronto academics and corporate philanthropists began pushing for a world-class medical research hub in Canada's biggest city. As disciples of Harvard management professor Michael Porter's "cluster" theory, they wanted to leverage local research in the hopes of commercializing discoveries and transforming Ontario's economy.
Located in an abandoned wing of the old Toronto General Hospital, MaRS would connect medical researchers with entrepreneurs. It would provide mentoring, networking and startup funding to turn ideas into blockbuster new technologies. Billions of private investment dollars and thousands of jobs would follow, creating the same kind of virtuous circle that exists in such tech hubs as Silicon Valley and Boston.
In 2003, Progressive Conservative premier Ernie Eves provided $38-million to get MaRS off the ground. It was a modest investment that, combined with private and corporate donations, allowed MaRS to provide modest support to fledgling startups.
But MaRS's leaders soon succumbed to empire-building.
MaRS expanded its med-tech mandate to include other industries, such as social innovation, information and communications technology (ICT), entertainment and clean tech. No matter that the incursion into ICT duplicated the services of more focused and established ventures, such as Waterloo's Communitech and Invest Ottawa.
The recession temporarily put MaRS's plans for an ultra-modern 20-storey office tower on hold.
But the Liberal government of Mr. Eves's successor, Dalton McGuinty, was only too eager to relaunch the project on the eve of the 2011 provincial election with a $224million loan from Infrastructure Ontario. "We're going to solve some of the most difficult problems facing humanity right here in the middle of this network," innovation minister Glen Murray claimed.
Now that it's up, the MaRS tower is only 31 per cent leased and MaRS can't service its debts. The government is paying back the loan to itself. It also just bought out a U.S. real-estate developer's stake in the project for $65-million, even though Ms. Wynne has promised to sell assets to ease her government's $12.5-billion deficit.
So far, Ontario taxpayers have plowed about $500-million into MaRS. But that's not the end. Ontario is now contemplating moving hundreds of civil servants (hardly a bunch of innovators) into the high-priced MaRS space.
MaRS's high-powered board of directors continues to stand by management's lofty salaries (the CEO was paid $532,501 last year).
The board, led by former Royal Bank CEO Gord Nixon, also continues to claim MaRS has "delivered more than $3-billion in economic impact" since its 2003 launch.
The latter claim is dubious since MaRS appears to take credit for every job created and every dollar of venture capital raised by its "client" startups, no matter how tangential its role in their expansion. Besides, scaling up and commercialization are the true measures of success. And no MaRS-mentored startup has come close to the major leagues.
"The top-down industry cluster is modern-day snake oil," says Prof. Wadhwa. Any politician who says otherwise is living on another planet.

Stake in Cheesegrater pays off for Oxford Properties: Canadian investors who bet on the British real estate market when the economy was shrinking are now seeing handsome returns

Full text:   People are lined up in an hourlong queue outside the latest skyscraper to rise on London's skyline.
They're vying for a brief peek inside the 46-floor Leadenhall Building - nicknamed the "Cheesegrater" by locals for its iconic right-angle design - during a citywide open house of London's architectural wonders.
In November, tenants will begin moving into the Leadenhall, which isn't just a symbol of the radically changing face of London, like The Shard and other tall buildings that have caught the public eye. It embodies the decisive role Canadian firms have staked on the frontlines of London's white-hot real estate market.
"I'm standing in my office right now looking out my window and [the Leadenhall Building] dominates the Square Mile skyline," says Paul Brundage, executive vice-president of Canadian commercial real estate giant Oxford Properties Group Inc.'s Europe division.
"It's very difficult not to put it in what you call that trophy category," he says proudly of the Graham Stirk-designed, 610,000-square-foot commercial building, which Oxford holds in a 50-50 joint venture with local firm British Land.
At the height of the financial crisis in 2008, Mr. Brundage arrived in London to begin building Oxford's strategy in Europe. The plan was to shift the company's portfolio from 100 per cent Canadian holdings to a 6040 per cent Canada-foreign split.
Altogether Oxford has bet $5-billion on London so far. Today the firm outright owns, or has a stake in, five large London office properties. These include St Martin's and King Edward Court, home of the London Stock Exchange, which border the historic London square beside St Paul's Cathedral.
Mr. Brundage's mission was to focus on office properties with investments across the risk spectrum. Key to this was building relationships. "We knew we needed to find an opportunity to get into one of the next-cycle development sites," he says.
"We were lucky to get to know the British Land team when I first came over here," he adds. "They owned the site, they were looking for a partner to de-risk the amount of capital they were going to put in it." Construction on the Leadenhall Building began in 2011 when London's property market was still in a fragile state. The strategy is already paying off, Mr. Brundage says. The Leadenhall Building, which sits at the heart of London's financial district, is now valued at significantly more than its £340-million ($610-million) development cost in 2010, he notes.
Nearby, a bidding war under way for the iconic Gherkin tower, which went into receivership last April after one of its joint owners, Germany's IVG Immobilien, filed for insolvency, is a microcosm of the city's sizzling market. With more than 200 bidders lined up, the price for the 40floor building is pushing north of $1.1-billion. Roughly 40 per cent of its would-be buyers are from Asia, 20 per cent from North America, and 15 per cent from the Middle East.
In 2013 $35-billion worth of London commercial real estate changed hands, according to CBRE Global Research and Consulting, surpassing a record $32billion in 2007. Foreign buyers made up 72 per cent of those transactions, according to Deloitte's real estate team. There is high demand for that space on the rental side, too. In a recent analysis of the office market, CBRE reports a third quarterly decline in vacancy rates in central London in a row. Prime space is now in very short supply. The most recent quarterly report on office properties by Knight Frank shows a 9-per-cent hike in prime office rents in the City.
Not all of the opportunity is in London's financial district. "We did have some earlier investments in The City, but we exited just over a year ago," says Andrea Orlandi, head of real estate investments, Europe, for Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), which entered the market in 2008.
The crown corporation expanded last year into other areas of London, particularly the West End, in a joint venture with Hermes Real Estate Investment Management Ltd. The large British pension fund, Mr. Orlandi says, has been able to pick out smaller properties CPPIB may have overlooked.
"It's really a value-add strategy that extends itself across London," he says of CPPIB's $314-million half-stake in eight West End office buildings owned jointly with Hermes. "The City is a more cyclical market," he says, "The West End tends to show more growth in a secular fashion, let's say, and a little bit more supply constraints."
Moving forward, the more than $3-billion CPPIB has invested in Britain will be directed to deals with Hermes in London's South Bank and the city's eastern sector. It is also about to realize a new $1.3-billion development in partnership with Land Securities that will make over 5.5 acres near the West End Victoria underground station by 2016. The ambitious design features 480,000 square feet of office space, as well as retail, restaurants and 170 luxury modern apartments.
CPPIB isn't the only Canadian firm that has exited London's financial district. In August, Ivanhoé Cambridge sold the Woolgate Exchange, its only office property in The City, and London at large, in favour of a residential focus.
"We decided to take the profit and recycle that money," says Sylvain Fortier, executive vicepresident, residential, hotels and real estate investment funds.
After nearly two years in the Ivanhoé Cambridge portfolio, he says, Woolgate had made a 20per-cent return. "We basically felt like we had achieved our business plan, but way earlier than expected."
The market is two or three years into uplift in rental values, says Mr. Orlandi, meaning buyers must be more selective. The Bank of England also indicates it intends to raise interest rates.
When it comes to financing, there's a squeeze on returns if the cost of borrowing is higher.
A whiff of instability also hangs in the air. U.S. banks recently threatened to move their staff to Dublin after Prime Minister David Cameron promised a referendum to decide whether Britain stays in the European Union if he wins the 2015 general election.
But none of this fazes Mr. Brundage. "The portfolio is diversified enough that we can manage that risk and withstand those kind of shocks," he says.

Darren Sissons was born in New Zealand and has lived in Australia, Taiwan, London and Canada. So it's perhaps not surprising that he looks globally when hunting for dividend stocks.
"There are opportunities outside North America that you can't necessarily get here," says the managing director with Portfolio Management Corp., a Toronto firm that caters to highnet-worth individuals.
Today, he'll be discussing five of his top international dividend picks. Before we get to them, a few caveats are in order.
Here at Yield Hog, I normally discuss Canadian and U.S. dividend stocks.
I don't typically venture outside North America because I'm more comfortable investing in what I know.
Besides, many U.S. companies - Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola and McDonald's, for example - provide plenty of international exposure.
If you're investing abroad, you need to understand not only the company, but the economy and political environment. Also keep in mind that, depending on your broker, you may have to pay a higher commission than you would for a Canadian or U.S. stock.
(All of the following companies have American depositary receipts that trade on the U.S. over-the-counter market, with the exception of Unilever, which trades on the New York Stock Exchange.)
It's also worth noting that dividends from foreign companies are often subject to withholding tax.
Bottom line: Do your homework. For his part, Mr. Sissons says the extra work is well worth it given the breadth of great investing opportunities available in other countries.
A common theme with most of the stocks listed below is that the local government or the company's founding family own a large stake.
"In our experience, a major shareholder tends to be a positive factor," Mr. Sissons says.
Keppel Corp. Ticker: KPELY (OTC) Yield: 4 per cent*
Based in Singapore, Keppel is one of the world's biggest builders of offshore oil drilling rigs. The company, in which Singapore's sovereign-wealth fund owns a 21-per-cent stake, also has interests in real estate, power generation, water and logistics. The dividend has grown for 23 consecutive years and since 2000 the company has also paid eight special dividends. Mr. Sissons says the stock, which trades near five- and 10-year lows on a price-to-book basis, is attractively priced due to negative sentiment toward Asia and a slowdown in capital spending in the oil sector.
Kuehne & Nagel International AG KHNGY, KHNGF (OTC) Yield: 3.2 per cent
Switzerland's Kuehne & Nagel is a global logistics company engaged in sea freight, air freight and overland transportation. Klaus-Michael Kuehne, grandson of founder August Kuehne, owns a 53-per-cent stake and has run the company for more than four decades. "It's a very cash-rich business," Mr. Sissons says. Revenues have consistently grown faster than global GDP, he says, and the dividend has climbed at a five-year annualized rate of more than 10 per cent - not including special dividends that come along every few years.
Kone Oyj KNYJY, KNYJF (OTC) Yield: 3.1 per cent
Going up? Elevator maker Kone, based in Finland, has raised its dividend at a "phenomenal" five-year annualized rate of 25 per cent. It has also paid three special dividends since 2010. Although the stock is "a little expensive," the company is attractive because its elevators and escalators - found in Asia, Europe and North America - provide an ongoing revenue stream from regular servicing and maintenance. Controlled by the Herlin family since the 1920s, the company has a solid balance sheet and benefits from urbanization in developing countries.
MTR Corp. MTRJY (OTC) Yield: 3 per cent
MTR operates Hong Kong's Mass Transit Railway - one of the world's most profitable and reliable metro systems. It also manages transit in Stockholm, London, Melbourne and several cities in mainland China. Controlled by the Hong Kong government, MTR has raised its dividend at a five-year annualized rate of about 12 per cent. The current turmoil in Hong Kong has hurt the shares, but this could be a good buying opportunity if, as Mr. Sissons expects, a political solution is found. The company is also one of the biggest landowners in Hong Kong.
Unilever NV UN, UL (NYSE) Yield: 3.8 per cent
Anglo-Dutch consumer goods giant Unilever owns dozens of well-known brands, including Hellmann's, Dove, Becel, Alberto-Culver and Ben & Jerry's. The company has a strong balance sheet and has grown its dividend at a five-year annualized clip of 4.5 per cent. Because of a slowdown in emerging markets, "the company is now on sale. ... I see this as the kind of stock you can buy and hold for 20 years without too much worry," Mr. Sissons says.
*All yields are based on trailing 12month dividend payments, excluding special dividends.

Park caretakers, and the houses they live in, represent quainter times in Vancouver.
When caretaker houses were built in city parks between the 1920s and 1960s, the idea was that a caretaker would have an almost parental role, chasing away badly behaving teenagers, acting as the neighbourhood lost and found, and keeping an eye on the playground. Now that the city has gone from a sleepy, overgrown town to a place that is denser and more complicated, the caretaker's role has become obsolete.
"It is a model that really worked in the earlier days of the city when the caretaker might spot Johnny smoking and say, 'I'm going to tell your mother,' " says Jil Weaving, park board co-ordinator of arts, culture and engagement. "It was a time when Vancouver was really a smaller place and the activities in parks were easier ones to deal with.
"It's not the same as it used to be; the city has grown so much. The kind of things that go on in parks are often much more complex."
Although the caretaker job is slowly being phased out through attrition, the caretaker houses shall remain. For a few years after the phase-out began 10 years ago, the houses stood empty. In the last three years, however, the houses have found a new purpose. There are 56 caretaker houses in parks throughout Vancouver, and of those, 35 are still home to live-in caretakers. In exchange for free rent, the job of the live-in caretaker is to open and close the washrooms and keep them clean, as well as offer an eyes-on-the-street community presence.
As the caretakers retire and move out, their houses are being converted into field houses for sports teams or artists-in-residence who use them during the day as part of a program run by the park board. Artists apply for the spaces and have a three-year agreement to use them in exchange for 350 hours of community-related work. The first batch is winding down their tenure and the park board is looking for another round of submissions, which are chosen by a panel. Sharon Kallis, an ecoartist, has been using Strathcona's McLean Park field house as a studio, and for workshops on weaving and dye making, using local plant materials. In the summer, she grew a flax garden to teach people how linen is made. Passersby assume she is the live-in park warden.
"People often come to the door, yes. They want to let us know that there is a toilet overflowing or there's no toilet paper in washroom, or they found a needle in the park," she says, seated in her field house studio, which has a small, outdated kitchen and feels uninsulated. Ms. Kallis lives in a co-op apartment 10 blocks away, and can walk to work.
She says the program has given her a chance to make valuable connections in the community, with ecologists and gardeners. Her husband, also an artist, works from another field house nearby.
"It's been really incredible how people have responded to learning how to weave and working with materials they could harvest themselves," she says.
There is big demand for recreational and arts and culture spaces, says director of recreation, Thomas Soulliere, which is part of the reason the houses are being repurposed.
"It's a situation where the fortunate few got in there, and were able to live in some of the most beautiful locations in the city, while having responsibilities in the upkeep of the facilities and around the park," he says. "As they become vacant, we are looking at what other purposes those buildings might serve. In some cases, we've added capital funds to fix them up and bring them up to code, but while still preserving that heritage quality."
The longest serving park caretaker lived in her east side house for 33 years, before she moved out last December. Several of the caretakers left when they became elderly and the houses became too much work.
In Canada, park caretaker houses are a unique part of the West Coast identity. Mr. Soulliere, who is from Calgary, doesn't know of a Canadian city outside of the Lower Mainland that operates such houses.
"The more time I spend in Vancouver, the more it makes sense that we would provide these kinds of facilities," he says. "I think the parks have a special place in people's hearts in this city. And there's a real understanding and appreciation for the nostalgic value that these buildings provide."
The houses are solidly built, so there's no talk of tearing them down. A few of the older ones are on the heritage registry, including the house at Memorial Park West, located at West 31st Avenue and Dunbar. Caretaker Jack Darcus and his wife, Linda, have lived at the house for 20 years, (their living space is confined to a secondfloor suite) and raised their daughter there. Nestled in one of Vancouver's most beautiful parks, the heritage house is large, with mullioned windows and a cedar shake roof, and believed to have been built in 1932.
"I usually have to call the police about twice a year when a party gets going and things start getting broken, and then the police come and flush it out. But basically, dayby-day, it's very peaceful. It's a very nice park," Mr. Darcus says.
"There are parks in rougher areas that do take a tremendous beating - they'll tear the toilets off the floors every weekend type of thing. So, I'm fortunate."
Mr. Darcus, 73, a former filmmaker and established painter with a studio on Granville Island, says he'll stay on at the house as long as he can. Mr. Darcus grew up in Marpole, attended the University of British Columbia, and has been nominated for several Genie Awards. He hopes the park board will consider continuing the caretaker program, which has enabled him to stay in Vancouver. Over the years, he says he's met other caretakers with various backgrounds, including police officers, writers and actors. Not surprisingly, he's also met a lot of people who'd love to become park caretakers.
"It's been my support in a way, and for my wife, too. She's a filmmaker. It's allowed us to carry on with our lives. In terms of the number of people that have profited from that program and given back to the city, it's numerous.
"And I think it's better that you have live-in caretakers because they have pride in the place, and responsibility, and everything else that plays into it. And they become part of the neighbourhood, too - I have many friends in the neighbourhood."
There have been challenges, living in a publicly funded building, even if it is rent-free. When he and his wife and their small daughter first moved into the house, there were rats, raccoons and squirrels living in the attic. About a decade ago, the park board insulated the house, and a couple of years ago, they painted it.
Also, Mr. Darcus and his wife have sat outside the property market all these years, while their contemporaries have seen their house values escalate. That could be viewed as a downside. But he's not concerned.
"Let's put it this way, if I can paint something today that somebody is going to want to keep after I'm dead and gone, then I've had a very good day. The quality of my life is good. Everything I do is on spec, so it's not sellable until it's finished and maybe not even then. That's the life of an artist.
For me, time is far more important than money. Time to work, time to think, time to try stuff out. I have a different set of values perhaps than most people. But no, I don't regret not having invested in the real estate market.
"It's everyone's normal way of going forward. It's built the city and it keeps it a nice place, and it's a good way to go. But it's not my way."

If you drop by WORKshop these days, you can catch a wonderful short film about the house of the future, as was envisaged circa 1957. The trim, young housewife in this Cold War vision glides effortlessly among efficient appliances and ultramodern furnishings, while her equally trim, young husband shaves with the latest electric razor. The couple's adorable daughter frolics through the streamlined open-plan interior of the house, which is shaped like a flying saucer. It is, or was, the American dream.
Such was the meaning of "smart" residential architecture and design upward of 60 years ago. So what is "smart" now? The word is popular and buzzy, but vague. How, exactly, will a "smart" dwelling of the near future appear, perform, behave itself?
Last summer, Larry Wayne Richards, WORKshop's creative director, invited students in Ontario's architecture, engineering and environmental science programs to come up with answers to these questions. The competition, called House 2020 - you read about it here in August - attracted 22 proposals, from which a four-person jury last week picked three front-running entries.
All 22 will be on public view at WORKshop (the design studio and store is on the subway level at 80 Bloor St. W.) until the end of January.
If the prognostications of the contestants turn out to be correct, the house of tomorrow will look much like the house of today - or, for that matter, yesterday.
There will be solar panels for heating and geothermal systems for cooling, devices for recycling rainwater, effective insulation, high-performance glazing, extensive prefabrication - technologies and techniques, that is, already with us and not futuristic at all. Cybernetic automation will play no greater part in our lives and lifestyles than it does already. No bold innovations in construction methods and materials are on the horizon. What we can expect are many homes like Red Roof House, one of projects featured here, with its pitched roof, thick insulation, granny suite - and without a thing to cause anyone to take a second look.
Look at the 1957 film again: The house of the future is optimistic, ambitious, forward-looking. The prevailing mood of the 2014 show is resignation to the present-day regime of codes and city planners and the tried-and-true practices of the home-building industry.
But the scarcity of futuristic pizzazz in these projects may be saying nothing about the imaginative capacities of the students.
The competition brief, after all, stipulated that the submitted design must be "realizable, pragmatic, and cost-effective," and buildable just six years from now.
It also said the structure had to fit on a normal-sized, rectangular subdivision lot in southern Ontario. These demands for prompt, suburban doability checked what might have been really bold and original thinking by the students.
That said, 22 individuals or teams from across the province threw themselves into the making (on a tight deadline) of these sometimes interesting proposals, however cramped they may have felt while doing so. Not everyone obeyed the regulations.
In fill House, which won an honourable mention, is a 300-squarefoot, prefab, readily portable, $50,000 unit that no public authority would allow anywhere near suburbia. Motion House, which won nothing, is not a house at all, but rather a plea for walkable neighbourhoods.
Each finalist in this round in the House 2020 process - the jury will rank the three in a second judging, later this year or early in the next - has played the game according to the rules. The one who coloured most carefully within the lines is Peter Kitchen. His low-tech adaptation of a plain Ontario tract house, with white walls and double-height spaces and good cross-ventilation, promises to perform better than a developer-built residence. Considered artistically, however, it doesn't make the heart sing.
The jagged geometry of Plus House, by Christopher Tron and Javier Huerta-Juarez, on the other hand, is memorable. It is based on the gridded layout of the building's most conspicuous structural elements, seven rammed-earth piers shaped, in plan, like Greek crosses. The scheme is simple, but not simplistic, and, although the proposed dwelling is not large, it has firm authority.
If Plus House is toughly material and local, Nabia Majeed's Internet of Space floats in the invisible ocean of information we swim in. Unusually in this competition, her house subtly subverts the typical suburban residential format with strong programming. The studio, the reading room, the 3-D printing pantry are purpose-built and outfitted for their roles. They aren't merely what happens to unused bedrooms. Even the driveway is "smart."
For the record, all the finalists in House 2020 are graduate students in the University of Toronto's architecture school. The jurors - who did not know the identities and affiliations of the contestants when they did their work - were U of T professors Ted Kesik and Carol Moukheiber as well as Colin Ripley, architecture chair at Ryerson University, and the Hong Kong-based developer and fashion entrepreneur Kin Yeung, who founded WORKshop and is funding the competition.

Full text:   rsmith@globeandmail.com
Hipster hatred is reaching a new boiling point. Everyone who has ever dined in a restaurant in which $13 drinks were served in mason jars has by now savoured Will Self's funny screed in the New Statesman (""The awful cult of the talentless hipster has taken over") in which every stereotype of bearded urban life is nastily and hysterically insulted.
You may have also read a widely circulated piece in GQ last April by Daniel Riley (""I'm Only into Jean-Georges's Early Stuff"), which described a young person's competitive addiction to eating in cool new restaurants, as if this activity formed a kind of cultural study or research, and this naive author's stunning realization that obsessing about food is kind of shallow.
In Self's piece, the British author blames his generation ("he is 53) for what he calls "the miserable gallimaufry of web-headed, tiny-bike-riding, moronic poseurs" who run the supposedly most fashionable districts of the world's greatest cities. It is our fault, he posits, that restaurants have become places crammed with farm machinery in which one must listen to the loudest trip-hop, because we, the aging Xers, are the ones who claimed "that there was no distinction between high and popular culture, and that adverts should be considered as an art form," and we were the ones who sprayed out the "slurry" that was cultural theory. Worse, we did all that from an absurdly privileged position, at a time when there were jobs in universities for jerks like us.
Riley's GQ hipster renunciation comes from the opposite direction, and it is a child-like explaining of the obvious. The author admits that he has "bought into a system in which part of my value ... can be measured by the restaurants where I've stuffed my face." This cultural knowledge, in his social circles, was as valuable as the novelists or directors you knew. He claims to be not rich and to have only visited restaurants that appealed to the "cashstrapped," whatever that means in New York. "And these restaurants - with their tatted-up chefs barking orders over a Zeppelin Pandora station - acted as proxies for the culturally cool things we couldn't afford."
This is exactly the kind of superficiality that people suspect they are going to find in young men with giant beards. It bears out the standard media-borne hipster-hating insult: shallow, fake, posing, lightweight.
Everyone who is flamboyant has always attracted this exact list of insults, from Oscar Wilde on. These are the same insults that used to be levelled against me and my pals when we dressed up as punk rockers, with our spiky hair and our straight-leg jeans.
Of course it was a pose; all fashion is a pose. I enjoy poses and I admire sartorial flamboyance. I really can't imagine myself as someone who wants to sneer at a person who likes a different style of dress; I am not a redneck. And yet my inner eye roll when I see the 1860s miner's beard and the rolled-up jeans and the hornrimmed glasses and the plaid shirt ... That eye roll is so convulsive it's well on the way to being vocal. I am disgusted with myself for feeling this. People can wear whatever they want.
And why is it that so many criticisms of so-called hipster culture centre on restaurants? A stereotype has arisen: the place where each dish requires 200 words to describe, where the lamb was raised in a Montessori school, the tables are laminate or concrete ("the expensive place around the corner from me called Barnyard or Manure has a patio filled with old tractors and concrete-topped tables), the glasses are old jars, and the smallest thing costs $30. What is so annoying about these places is the contrast between their culinary aspirations, which are high indeed, and their comfort level, which is laughably low.
Young people are more than their restaurants, of course. Yes, they are their weedy folk music, and their video games, and their half-assed Buddhism, and their degrees in gender and privilege studies, and their deadly serious knowledge of celebrities. Yes, they are all that: there's plenty to make fun of. It's just that the only point of contact between old curmudgeons and the stylish youth happens in the restaurants where the latter work, so the restaurant concretizes, for the outsider, current aesthetic values.
But even the sneering mainstream media ("what a young person would call the MSM), are confused about what they think of hipster neighbourhoods. After all, spending a lot of money in restaurants is something that older and clean-shaven people do.
They like lots of new restaurants with locally sourced organic produce. And they sure do like to talk about real estate values, which unquestionably rise when the beards and the mandolins move in.
We were all very proud, weren't we, when Vogue named a Canadian neighbourhood as one of the hippest in the world? ("Toronto's Queen Street West came in at No. 2, beating counterpart neighbourhoods in Paris, New York and Berlin.) It was all over the Canadian news. It means we are sensitive and cultivated.
So what do we hate, exactly? Do we hate fine food made with local ingredients? Why can sophistication and sensitivity, generally desirable values, be so annoying?
Perhaps because we are still not so sure we want those things?
Or rather because we suspect that the purported values of the bearded waiter - especially classlessness and inclusion - are not actually in any way represented by pan-seared Northern Ontario pickerel with beet wasabi mousse at $27? Is it the strange sense that everything around us, even our sophistication, is somehow false, meaningless, a painted cardboard bulwark keeping out the real world of Putin and Ebola and the Islamic State?

Full text:   Once a quiet strip, King Street East's wave of development is changing the atmosphere. It could pay dividends for the city's art scene
abozikovic@globeandmail.com
'This area is never going to turn into anything." When Klaus Nienkamper set up his furniture store at the corner of King and Berkeley streets in 1968, that was the message he heard from a banker who had refused to give him a mortgage.
"The message was very clear," recounts his son, Klaus Jr. "This area of Toronto was decrepit.
They didn't agree with his vision at all."
Forty-six years later, things have worked out okay: The younger Mr. Nienkamper presides over the family retail business, one of Canada's most interesting showrooms for highdesign housewares, in the same 1845 building. Still, you probably haven't been there shopping unless you are in a very rarefied group of consumers. ("Or going to Staples across the street.)
Today, King East is still a niche destination, much more chic but surprisingly quiet.
But a wave of residential, retail and office development is changing the atmosphere - and a group of local merchants and community groups is hoping to lure Torontonians to what they are dubbing the King East Design District. To that end, Saturday's 3d parti Contemporary Design Festival will bring a wave of installations by designers such as Fugitive Glue, artists including Thrush Holmes and architects RAW into 14 spaces along the strip.
In a sense it's interesting that this place doesn't yet have a clear identity. West Queen West, Leslieville and more recently the Junction have all become identifiable destinations for culture, dining and shopping; still, the city's critical mass of high-design retailers isn't found there, or in affluent Rosedale, but on King East, spanning the St. Lawrence neighbourhood and Corktown.
For decades, Klaus was relatively isolated, an island together with their neighbours Italinteriors. About a decade ago, Mr. Nienkamper says, this began to change: drawn by relatively inexpensive leases, highend retailers such as Studio B and Kiosk followed. Today, between Jarvis Street and the river is a long string of showrooms and retailers ranging from the German kitchens of Bulthaup to a range of European furniture at Kiosk.
In general, this stretch of eastern downtown was left quiet from the 1950s onward, as industry and commerce moved steadily west. City planning helped spur a wave of development in the past decade, largely through condo towers along Adelaide and Richmond streets. The Globe and Mail will move in 2015 into a new office tower being built at 351 King St. E., on what was a parking lot for the Toronto Sun - and right across the street from Klaus.
This is an area rapidly, and belatedly, being knit back into the living city. The Distillery District is just blocks to the south, and the new West Don Lands neighbourhood - the athletes' hub at next year's Pan Am Games - will become home to more than 10,000 people.
In this context, what's the benefit of having a design district? "It was quite clear that there was a culture in KEDD that needed a special emphasis," says Al Smith, executive director of the St. Lawrence Market BIA, an organizer of the event. "It's a neighbourhood different from anywhere else. The store owners are connected to a global network; they live design at an international level."
This is true. And in other cities, this sort of place - a nexus for global design culture - has paid dividends for the art world and created a lively neighbourhood. In Miami, a developer, Craig Robins, oversaw the creation of the Miami Design District; starting in the late '90s, his companies started buying up warehouses in a forlorn neighbourhood, 10 miles from the city's tourist hub. They brought in furniture retailers, and crosspollinated them with artists' studios and galleries who received cheap rents and prospered. And, crucially, they brought good restaurants. When I visited six years ago, it was still forlorn; but Mr. Robins launched the festival Design Miami, playing off the international Art Basel Miami fair, and everything changed, fast. Today the lowrent tenants have been supplanted by fashion boutiques. The luxury conglomerate LVMH has invested in real estate.
The artist TYPOE, a Miami native who will be coming to this weekend's event, has seen this magic happen. He runs a gallery that was a tenant in the Design District for three years, and happily so; the effect on the city was tremendous, he says.
Today, "People like me, I can buy some shoes, stop in at Margiela, go eat, buy some silverware at Design Within Reach," he says. "The people who enjoy that market can come there for many different things." Some artists, TYPOE says, aren't impressed that they were used as real estate pawns. On the other hand, the Wynwood district next door "is alive, it's got galleries, a lot of bars, and cool shops." And these areas, he says, "were places nobody would even drive through."
This sort of premeditated gentrification isn't likely to happen in Toronto's design district. Toronto doesn't have Miami's unique position in the art world, and King East is ("thankfully) an authentic piece of city, mixed in its building stock and its population. Great restaurants and luxury retail have other more homes in Toronto. But with a bit of hustle, this might change.
Enter this weekend's event, and its installations. For his piece, TYPOE will invade the precise precincts of Bulthaup with a suite of works in neon - a new medium for him. "When I think about public art, neon seems like a natural thing to me," he says: "You're walking down the street, it'll grab your attention, it'll make you look."
The Globe and Mail presents a panel on the future of Canadian design with Alex Bozikovic, Globe design writer Matthew Hague, and featuring Marianne McKenna of KPMB Architects, Shauna Levy, head of the Design Exchange and Klaus Nienkamper, Jr., of Klaus. Biagio, 155 King St. E. Saturday, 1:30pm.

Abstract: I studied at Ryerson in Toronto and I wanted to be a writer originally, a screenwriter, so I told my parents that and I moved to Toronto. And one day my sister calls me and she says, 'You know mom and dad think you're studying calligraphy. You know that, right? You'd better call and explain what you're doing.' They had no idea what I did.

It's hard to think of a better way to kick off our coverage of British Columbia filmmakers at the Vancouver International Film Festival than by interviewing a local filmmaking success story trying something new, and telling an important Vancouver story as she does. Julia Kwan, best known for her Sundance prize-winning feature debut Eve and the Fire Horse , has made a documentary - her first. Everything Will Be is an elegy for the bustling Chinatown of her childhood, now in transition. She profiles 13 locals, mostly elderly Chinese people, but also a proud Italian cheese-shop owner and local real estate guru Bob Rennie, whose office and private art museum are in the neighbourhood.
When Ms. Kwan was growing up, both of her parents, Chinese immigrants, worked in Chinatown - her father, now 83, at two famous restaurants, the Ho Ho and then Ming's, where he was head waiter. Her mother, now 74, washed and folded sheets at Keefer Laundry, now the Treasure Green Tea Company. One of the businesses profiled in Everything Will Be , the tea shop is where Ms. Kwan and I meet over steaming cups of rich, nutty tea.
What did Chinatown mean to you growing up?
It meant a lot to me as a child because I spent every weekend in Chinatown. In the seventies and eighties it was really vibrant, a bustling community. I recognized the grittiness of it; I would dodge the drunks on the streets, but it was all very matter of fact. And it really was a community. My mom always seemed so out of her element [elsewhere]. Because to this day, she can't really speak any English. But when she came to Chinatown, she felt at home. And that's why I gravitated towards these people when I was doing my research - the elderly, people in the twilight years.
What led to your decision to make this film?
Chinatown has been on the decline for the last couple of decades. There's multiple factors involved, one of them being proximity to the Downtown Eastside, and also the satellite Chinatowns like Richmond. There's a perception that it's dirty, it's dangerous. I confess before making this film, whenever friends would say let's go out for Chinese food, we would always pick Richmond, so I realized making this film that I was part of the problem.
Why make a documentary at this stage in your career?
I was approached by a producer at the National Film Board who was looking at making a feature documentary with filmmakers who don't traditionally work in the documentary genre. I said no the first time and then a year later he approached me again and I was more open to it. It was originally going to be a contrast film between Chinatown and satellite Chinatown in Richmond, but as I was doing the research it felt like my heart was in Chinatown more and I felt this great sense of history and community, so I really wanted to explore that, and the changes. One day I was walking down Pender Street, and I counted 20 shuttered shops within a two-block radius. So I really wanted to make a time capsule of this particular moment in time.
What were some of the challenges or opportunities you found working in this genre?
It was very challenging for me in the sense that making a narrative film is highly constructed and we think in the frame down to the extras. Whereas in a documentary you throw that out the window. You have to work in a really organic way. It's very challenging not having a script to work from. Although I attempted to write a script, but that was silly. And it's a small group. With Eve I think we had 80 people on set and here at one point I was the camera person. I haven't done that since university.
What do your parents think of this project?
I studied at Ryerson in Toronto and I wanted to be a writer originally, a screenwriter, so I told my parents that and I moved to Toronto. And one day my sister calls me and she says, 'You know mom and dad think you're studying calligraphy. You know that, right? You'd better call and explain what you're doing.' They had no idea what I did. Now my parents are ailing and they're old so I feel like this is almost like a film for them because this might be the last of mine that my parents see, especially my dad. He's got Parkinson's and Alzheimer's. So this film is a tribute to them.
This interview has been condensed and edited.
Everything Will Be screens at VIFF Sept. 29, Oct. 1 and Oct. 3.

Full text:   Owners peeled away years of patchwork repairs and such charming, rustic features as a red pine floor
THE LISTING
Asking price : $879,900
Property taxes : $3,358.37 (2014)
Lot size : 18.58 by 90 feet
Agents : Lance and Brenda van der Kolk, sales representatives, ReMax Hallmark Realty Ltd., Brokerage .
Fixer-upers are often the most accessible way for first-time home buyers to get into the market. But there are fixerupers and then there are total restoration projects, like 87 Ivy Ave.
"It would have scared the average first home buyer away," says real estate representative Lance van der Kolk.
The Leslieville semi had been haphazardly converted into a rooming house when Dana and Galen Dineen bought in June, 2013. So they knew it would need a lot of work.
"And we were four and a half months pregnant at the time," Mrs. Dineen says.
"We had a fast deadline to finish the renovations."
The back story
Building a new interior for 87 Ivy turned out to be a family project. Mr. Dineen, who had been working in construction for a few years and now runs Echo Rock Contracting, completed the renovations himself along with the help of one other worker. And Mrs. Dineen helped with finishes and interior design.
Even in its dishevelled state, Mr. Dineen saw the potential when they first walked in.
"From the outside, it's a pretty brick house," he says. "And while the inside was divided into many rooms, you could see if you opened it up it'd be a fantastic space."
So, his first order of business was to take the entire house down to its studs and brick walls. And after peeling away years of patchwork repairs, he found the house had many charming, rustic features.
For example, under four layers of flooring - including hardwood, carpet, laminate and a fake laminate "carpet" - Mr.
Dineen discovered a beautiful red pine sub-floor. After sanding and patching it up, Mr. Dineen decided to keep it as the floor on the main and second floors.
"We thought that the rustic floors with the brick would be great," he says.
The featured brick wall runs along the east side of the home, all the way up to the third floor, and is made of nearly 100-yearold bricks from a now-defunct local Leslieville brick maker.
"[The different coloured bricks] were a really happy surprise," says Mr. Dineen. "I was expecting red brick when we started chipping away at the plaster. But it came out with some red, some brown and even some taupe."
After taking it down to bare bones, the Dineens built it back up, including new windows, new plumbing and new electrical. Mr. Dineen also built a multilevel deck and shed for the backyard, which is shaded by several giant old neighbourhood trees.
Inside, the basement was also finished and a mud room/laundry room was added. The main space in the lower level is currently used as a media room, but could easily be converted to a rental apartment since it has its own entrance, says Mr. van der Kolk.
"I find a lot of owners these days because the market is so hot ... want to have the ability to turn their basement into an apartment." says Mr. van der Kolk. "In this neighbourhood, this would fetch $900 to $1,000 a month in rent."
The first floor is now one open space, with the living room up near the street-facing windows, followed by a dining room and a kitchen with smooth cement countertops.
The second floor includes a four-piece bathroom, baby room and two guest rooms.

Everyone - Mr. van der Kolk, Mrs. Dineen and Mr. Dineen - agrees that the top floor is the best room in the house.
"While the whole house had a huge transformation," says Mrs. Dineen, "the third floor had a really big transformation."
When the Dineens bought the home, the top floor consisted of a dank bathroom and a kitchenette crammed into an attic apartment.
Now it's a split-level master suite. The south end, which is a step above the rest of the room, features a sitting area that looks out over the tops of the old neighbourhood trees.
The master bathroom was also totally transformed and enlarged to easily fit a tub at one end, a generous-sized shower stall and a double vanity.
Mrs. Dineen describes the space as very relaxing, remembering how being able to sit on the upper level and look out into the night made their sleepless nights as parents of a newborn a little less stressful.
"I think [the finished house] is a very good reflection of us and Galen's building style, which caters toward keeping character and the traditional aspects of a home," said Mrs. Dineen.
"It's got this great mix of old and new - such a contemporary character," adds Mr. van der Kolk.

Full text:   The price of admission to enter an elite club in Vancouver is going through the roof. To make the top 1 per cent in the city's market for single-family detached houses, a property needs to be assessed at more than $5.58-million.
Vancouver is well known for its pricey real estate. The median price for detached homes was $1,069,000 on July 1, 2013, based on assessed values for houses within the City of Vancouver.
Andrew Yan, an urban planner with Bing Thom Architects, crunched the numbers supplied by BC Assessment, the provincial Crown corporation that provides valuations on behalf of B.C. municipalities, and found the rich are getting richer, at least when it comes to their abodes.
He found that to claim bragging rights to be a member of the 1-per-cent club, a Vancouver property needs to be valued at $5,586,000 or higher. The most expensive homes, he found, have enjoyed the highest increases in assessed value over a five-year period. Comparing assessments conducted in 2013 with those in 2008, the value of homes in the 1-per-cent bracket has soared an average of 65.4 per cent from $3,377,000 in 2008.
Prices have jumped sharply for luxury homes due to increased demand from well-heeled buyers from other provinces and abroad, combined with a relatively limited number of listings for detached properties in a city where developers are increasingly focused on building condos and townhouses. Over the past three years, prices have been flat for condos and townhouses in Greater Vancouver, including the suburbs.
But within the City of Vancouver, detached homes assessed last year at $3,278,000 or higher qualify for being among the top 5 per cent, up 63.8 per cent from the threshold of $2,001,000 in 2008.
Getting to the upper crust's top 10 per cent means having a home valued at $2,601,000 or higher, up 60.4 per cent from $1,621,900 in 2008. To make it into the top-33rd percentile out of a total of about 67,800 detached houses, a homeowner needs to have a property valuation of at least $1,484,000. Assessed values in the top-33rd percentile climbed an average of 46 per cent during the five-year period.
A Globe and Mail review of the data reveals that Lululemon Athletica Inc. founder Chip Wilson's waterfront mansion is No. 1 on the latest assessment list, topping the B.C. charts at $54.2-million. In the previous assessment, as the home was being built, the value was $35.2-million The next three highest assessed values are all homes located along Belmont Avenue in the upscale Point Grey neighbourhood on Vancouver's west side.
A property registered to Pisonii (PTC) Ltd. is the runner-up at $46-million in the 2013 assessment, followed by the $28.6-million residence of philanthropist Nezhat Khosrowshahi and her husband, Future Shop founder Hassan Khosrowshahi. He is chairman of Persis Holdings Ltd. and serves on the board of the Bank of Canada. Fourth overall is the $25.6-million property owned by real estate developer Joseph Segal and his wife, Rosalie, a philanthropist.
Other prominent owners include Vancouver entrepreneur Jacqueline Cohen, whose waterfront home in the Kitsilano neighbourhood is assessed at $24.2-million - enough to place No. 9 in the list of B.C.'s highestvalued residential properties.
Mr. Yan's data show 4,360 detached properties were valued at $3-million or higher in his latest compilation. But owning a million-dollar home in Vancouver is increasingly run-of-themill, statistically speaking. He notes that 37,425 homes, or 55.2 per cent of the total detached properties on the assessment rolls, were pegged as being worth at least $1-million in mid-2013, up from 22,908 or 33.8 per cent in mid-2008.
Many first-time buyers look at townhouses and condos when entering the local market. Last month's home price index for Greater Vancouver townhouses reached $474,900, up 3.9 per cent from a year earlier, while condo prices have climbed 3.6 per cent to $379,200 over the past year.

Full text:   Low mortgage rates have driven Canadian home sales close to an all-time high, catching many economists by surprise.
Sales of existing homes have risen for seven months in a row, according to data released Monday by the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA), which represents Realtors and tracks the market by way of the Multiple Listing Service. August's sales level was the highest since January, 2010, and just six per cent below the record peak in February, 2007.
"This development did little to alleviate concerns that home buyer demand may be getting overly hot in Canada," Royal Bank of Canada economist Robert Hogue wrote in a research note Monday. "While brisk activity should be positive in theory, Canada's housing market may be at risk of overheating if recent trends persist."
The housing market's strength is significant enough that it prompted CREA to boost its forecast for sales this year. It now expects 475,000 existing homes will sell in 2014, up 3.8 per cent from last year. In June, it expected that number to be 463,400.
"A 30 basis point drop in mortgage rates earlier this year [has] delivered households an offer they can't refuse," said TorontoDominion Bank economist Diana Petramala, adding that housing activity is now about 10 per cent higher than the average level of the past decade.
Economists have long been expecting Canada's housing market to lose some steam, but the market has continued to defy expectations. The Bank of Canada, which had repeatedly been forecasting a so-called "soft landing," acknowledged this month that the market has been stronger than anticipated.
It would be difficult for policymakers in Ottawa to take steps to cool sales at this point, because the market's strength is not truly a national phenomenon. Roughly half of the 26 cities and local markets CREA tracks had falling sales both in August and so far this year, Bank of Montreal chief economist Douglas Porter noted. Calgary, Vancouver and Toronto have been lifting national averages, while markets such as Halifax and Winnipeg have been struggling.
Over all, August's sales were 1.8 per cent higher than July's on a seasonally adjusted basis, CREA said. Sales have slowed on a yearover-year basis in recent months, with August's level coming in just 2.1 per cent higher than a year earlier (without seasonal adjustment). In comparison, July's sales had been 7.2 per cent higher than a year earlier and June's 11.2 per cent higher.
"The deferral of sales and listings during an extraordinarily bleak winter delayed the start to the spring home buying season earlier this year," CREA stated in its revised forecast. "This deferral boosted activity in May and June as properties were snapped up after finally hitting the market, particularly in markets with a shortage of listings.
"Although this boost was and is still expected to be transitory, sales have yet to show signs of cooling as activity strengthened slightly further over the summer."
CREA said that it anticipates activity will peak during the third quarter, as the pent-up demand dissipates while "continuing home price increases erode housing affordability."
Indeed, prices continue to climb with the average national sales price in August coming in at $398,618, 5.3 per cent higher than a year earlier.
The MLS home price index, which seeks to create a more apples-to-apples comparison of price gains than the average, also rose 5.3 per cent.
Single-family homes are seeing greater price gains than condos or apartments, and Calgary, Toronto and Vancouver are seeing bigger price gains than other cities.
Factoring out Toronto and Vancouver, the national average price rose 3.9 per cent to $324,738.

Full text:   A long-shot prospect for mayor of Vancouver wants to slap a punitive fee on investors who purchase property in the West Coast city but do not live in their residence on a full-time basis.
Though there are few statistics on investor-owned properties in Vancouver's increasingly pricey real estate market, there is anecdotal evidence of darkened, multimillion-dollar homes with no visible full-time residents. One local urban planner found that in some downtown neighbourhoods, nearly a quarter of condos were empty or occupied by non-residents.
It is one of the more troubling aspects of Vancouver's global housing market, where many believe investment from abroad has helped push up the price of local property, making affordability a serious concern.
Meena Wong, a mental-health worker and community activist who is running for the left-leaning Coalition of Progressive Electors, or COPE, wants to make real estate investors pay more than just property taxes for the privilege of having an empty property in Vancouver.
"If you enjoy our city so much, do your duty - contribute," Ms. Wong said.
"And then we can use that money to build affordable housing."
Grappling with affordability issues related to global capital flows and migration, which skew housing prices locally, is the "new normal" for Pacific Rim cities such as Vancouver, Sydney, Singapore and Hong Kong, said Andrew Yan, an urban planner.
Mr. Yan, who digs up data on local housing issues, found that Vancouver has a higher rate of empty apartments and houses than other Canadian cities - particularly in the downtown Coal Harbour neighbourhood of condos and penthouses, an area ideal for investors, but which can often looks like a ghost town.
"What are the aspects of demand that we want to nurture, and what are the aspects of demand that we can or want to discourage?" Mr. Yan asked. "That's part of the unique nature of housing markets in global Pacific metropolises."
Ms. Wong, 53, represents a unique perspective on Vancouver's expensive housing market.
Born in Beijing, and raised in Hong Kong after her parents fled from the chaos of China's Cultural Revolution, Ms. Wong came to Vancouver at the age of 19. She is part of one of several waves of trans-Pacific immigration to this global, cosmopolitan city: There was an influx of Cantonesespeaking immigrants ahead of Britain's handover of Hong Kong and inflows of tens of thousands of Taiwanese in times of crossstrait tension. In more recent years, wealthier mainland Chinese have come over on formalized investor immigrant programs (the most significant of which was recently cancelled).
In a recent survey, major B.C. real estate firm Macdonald Realty said about a third of all singlefamily homes sold in Vancouver went to people with ties to mainland China. And many have speculated - in the absence of conclusive data - that this pool of foreign capital has played a role in rising prices in Vancouver. The price of a detached family home here is now $1.2-million, more than 10 times the median family income - which has made Vancouver the second-most unaffordable city in the world, in terms of housing, after Hong Kong, according to one survey.
But Ms. Wong, whose platform says she would declare a "State of Emergency" on affordable housing on her first day in office, is very much against discussing the origin of these buyers, saying it is easy to scapegoat a community.
"Most immigrants coming from mainland China are workers, hard-working people ... I don't want to paint the whole community as wealthy billionaires," she said. "I don't want this to be a racialized thing. But if you're going to buy in Vancouver and not live in Vancouver, we're going to do something about that."

Full text:   Twenty years after divorcing, Chris and Ron Thom collaborated on designing her dream home - the result proved to be timeless
In 1981, when artist Chris Thom decided to build her dream house on Hornby Island, she made an intriguing choice of architect: her former husband, Ron Thom. This was no ordinary ex, though: He was one of the most important Canadian architects of the 20th century.
Chris and Ron had divorced 20 years earlier, at which point he moved from Vancouver to Toronto to make his national reputation with such landmark buildings as Massey College, Trent University, the Metro Toronto Zoo and Shaw Festival Theatre. Ron Thom died in 1986; Chris passed away last January - now, their four children have put the waterfront house on the market.
"Dad had offered to help her design the house and she accepted it, because by then they were friends," recalls younger daughter Bronwen Thom McLeod. Her parents had first met in the early 1940s when they were both students at the Vancouver School of Art, and they shared a deep appreciation for art, craft, and nature. They discovered Hornby Island together in the late 1950s, while visiting the summer home of their former art teachers Grace Melvin and Charles Scott, who were both prominent figures in the West Coast cultural community.
After divorcing, Chris set her sights on eventually resettling on Hornby Island, while Ron remarried and raised a second family. By the time she was ready to build there two decades later, any bad feelings between them had largely evaporated. Their son, Robin Thom, acted as contractor, builder and landscaper. "Dad and Robin had originally worked as a team together, way back in the day, and now Mom was happy to see them working together again," Bronwen says. Her father also appreciated the chance to be back on Hornby Island, a locale that remained one of his most cherished places throughout his life.
The house is modest, but with the essential Ron Thom characteristics: front entrance with a covered enclave, plenty of raw wood, built-in furniture and cabinetry, deep overhangs, and every window boasting a carefully calibrated view of the spectacular scenery outside. The building follows the slope of the lot and seems to grow organically out of the landscape. It nonetheless boasts much more zen-like simplicity than his complex awardwinning houses in Vancouver and Toronto.
"It's a shoebox plan, essentially," says Robin - although a finely crafted shoebox, to be sure. Robin contributed his own skills and also helped source some signature materials, such as the home's heavy oak doors, repurposed from a defunct Vancouverbased printing press.
Robin gleaned much of his design savvy by following his father around on job sites and attending the site inspections with him. Robin also attended the Vancouver School of Art, and inherited his parents' creative bent, honing a first career as a landscaper and, more recently, a photographer. He remembers that his father was not the sort to give didactic lectures, but he gleaned much by Ron's penchant for communicating in images.
"Anything he couldn't say in words, he would draw," Robin recalls, "on a napkin, a piece of wood, the wall, whatever was around." The largest and most central room of the house, an expansive space with a jaw-dropping wideangle view of the tree-framed ocean and stone shore, was Chris Thom's huge art studio -- "my playroom," as she once described it to this reporter.
Although the house boasts just over 2,000 square feet and plenty of room to move around, work or play or relax, there is just one bedroom. "It was really designed just for Chris, with a small kitchen and big studio," notes the home's realtor, Donna Tuele of Coast Realty on Hornby Island. But, Tuele adds, the spatial arrangement is such that new owners can reconfigure the studio with its prime ocean view into whatever kind of space they want. With loads of natural daylight bathing shelves, cabinets, easels, worktables and nooks, the room seems ready for transformation by the next creative spirit. "The way the architect brought natural light coming in through the studio is brilliant," says Tuele. "The skylights are not lined up in the usual linear way; they're stragically placed over key working areas."
The Chris Thom home is one of a diminishing number of Ron Thom houses on the West Coast. Several of Thom's residential masterpieces have already fallen victim to real estate speculators and other buyers intent on razing them for something bigger and newer. The tear-down order has just been issued for a bungalow filled with Ron Thom's trademark artisanal woodwork, on West Vancouver's Ottawa Avenue. A few kilometres west of there, a gorgeous waterfront home on Erwin Drive - described by its realtor as a "well cared for ... authentic Ron Thom beach house" is nonetheless being marketed as tear-down, with a price tag of $9.5-million and an exhortation to "build your 6,500square-foot dream home." Some of the losses may be inevitable, says architectural historian Don Luxton, but each Ron Thom house is significant by the very fact of Thom's renown as one of the greatest Canadian architects of the 20th century. "Every one of these houses tells us something about the evolution of his career," says Luxton. "We may not be able to save every house, but we should be careful to think about them and document them."
The Hornby Island property is priced reasonably enough that the family is hoping it will find an appreciative buyer who will want to keep it and upgrade it. Listed at $929,000, the house has already drawn the attention of locals and mainlanders alike, including several architects entranced by its Ron Thom pedigree. A new owner would likely want to invest about $100,000 in upgrades, including a new roof and design adjustments to reconfigure it for their own lifestyles.
The property's sandstone beach has become a repository of beautiful memories for all four of Chris and Ron's children: as well as Bronwen and Robin, there was sister Sidney and brother Aaron. "We'd go down to the beach and look for sea urchins and chase bullheads, the tiny little fish that live in tide pools," Sidney recalls. "Or we'd spend hours looking for petroglyphs. Properties like that just don't exist any more."
Chris Thom had paid $11,500 in 1964 for the originally 2.5-hectare waterfront property, later subdividing it into three separate acreages and keeping the middle one for her own house - it turned out to be a stupendous long-term investment. But 50 years ago, long before Hornby became a mainstream mecca for stressed-out Vancouverites, it was an audacious purchase. "She told me that she would lie in bed at night sweating, worried that she had paid too much," says Sidney. "But she wanted the property that badly, and she knew what it would do for her life."

jmays@globeandmail.com
Mass-produced and massmarketed, typically laid out according to unimaginative industry-wide formulas, most apartments coming up for sale in Toronto's high-rises resist transformation into dwellings with contemporary flair and spatial originality. But even if a unit's interior were more structurally malleable than it usually is, local retail sources probably couldn't provide what's necessary to stamp the space with a distinctive signature.
The apartment-ready artworks, outfitting and furnishings commonly available in the popular shops tend to be blandly modernist (or blandly nostalgic), and largely uninspiring. One can, of course, buy classics, such as Le Corbusier's dining room table and Mies's Barcelona chairs. But to fashion an entire residential scheme around such 20th-century pieces would be to recreate a venerable, but safely distant past. What would a high-rise suite that reflects the creative values and most vigorous ideas of the present look like?
This question started to nag me after a recent visit to an apartment that had been kitted out, at considerable expense, in what amounted to the Ikea style - an aesthetic that definitely belongs to the last century, not this one.
So it was that, rummaging for an answer among my architectural books and magazines, I rediscovered a portfolio called 21st Century Architecture: Apartment Living . I had glanced at this collection in 2011, when it was published (by an Australian concern called Images), made a mental note to pick it up again some day, then forgotten about it.
Fortunately, the book - available in Canada for about $35 - was still on my shelf when I went rummaging, since, as I found, it offers no fewer than 54 answers to my question about contemporary apartment design, not just one. The prolific architectural writer and editor Beth Browne has gathered into her volume documentation about many new and recently overhauled apartments in Europe, North and South America, China and Australia, each executed by an architectural firm for a client not inclined to settle for the ordinary.
The characteristic up-tempo style of this century, if Ms. Browne is to be believed, is open, casual but alert, concerned with sustainability and partial to upholstery, to expressive and figurative painting, to luxurious bathrooms, to sensuous surfaces and textures. Attention to surface can occasionally become the driving force in the design. For a renovation in a 1950s Austrian apartment block, for instance, Atelier Peter Ebner covered every plane - floors, walls, ceilings - with a semi-abstract botanical pattern that defies the owner to put up art, but lends vivid interest to what would otherwise be blank expanses.
More commonly, interest in the skin of the apartment's interior finds expression in deployment of sumptuous materials and unusual shapes. Architect Isay Weinfeld, in a complete overhaul of an old New York flat, lined the new rooms with richly dark wood, while UNStudio sculpted a gleaming, curvaceous loft, also in New York, out of an unpromisingly ordinary oblong of space. Contemporary designers, such schemes show, are thinking well outside modernism's rigid, straight-sided white box, working with other geometries, imagining new ways (some of which, like wood panelling, seem old) to frame the apartment-dweller's domestic experience.
But the general attitude of new design toward the past, unlike that of high modernism or minimalism, is forgiving, accepting. Take, for example, the 3,000square-foot Beverley Street apartment by Toronto designers Merike Reigo and Stephen Bauer - the only Canadian project showcased in the book. In the living room of this suite, old-fashioned turquoise wingback chairs mingle comfortably with strictly modern black sofas. This is design beyond dogma.
Over the table in the Toronto suite's otherwise austere dining room hangs a humorously flamboyant, cartoon-like chandelier - a reminder that contemporary apartment style does not take itself all that seriously, and does not consider itself the interiordesign wing of a crusade to advance "good taste." Instead, it welcomes collision and mix-up, allusion and metaphor - so long as these poetic gestures do not clutter up the place, restricting the spaciousness, the easy flow, that the style celebrates above all else.
Some of the schemes illustrated here are in brand-new towers; others (such as the one in Toronto) are revisions of spaces in long-established residential structures; still others are insertions in recently converted warehouses or factories. One or two are small; clever architects in Ljubljana worked a little miracle with a loft only 320 square feet in area. Most of Ms. Browne's examples, however, are large, and many are dauntingly deluxe.
But her book is full of punchy, provocative design ideas that can be variously scaled, adapted and re-sized to fit any budget and lifestyle. There is a great deal here for empty-nesters about to downsize, young condo buyers furnishing their first digs - and for people who, like me, love apartment living, and enjoy seeing the ways others have discovered of doing so beautifully.

Abstract: Mr. [Daryl Katz] calculates Edmonton's new arena, dubbed Rogers Place, will be hit with 2.2 million visits annually, with people going there for Oilers' games, rock concerts and other events. Rogers Place is the anchor of his Edmonton Arena District (EAD), but foot traffic to the district will extend beyond its doors.

Full text:   It takes a lot of imagination to picture roughly four million people hanging out in Edmonton's downtown each year, all visiting in the name of entertainment. The dreams exist, the blueprints exist, but the buildings do not.
Negotiations are in their final stages. Diggers are digging. And Daryl Katz's real estate ambitions are at skyscraper levels.
When the billionaire talks about his plans to revitalize Edmonton, he has lists of numbers. Lots of numbers. He rattles off the amount of money that will be poured into Alberta's energy sector - the oil sands, refineries, pipelines - in order to back up numbers off a second list. That list is the one that requires creative thinking, and a lot of new buildings.
Mr. Katz calculates Edmonton's new arena, dubbed Rogers Place, will be hit with 2.2 million visits annually, with people going there for Oilers' games, rock concerts and other events. Rogers Place is the anchor of his Edmonton Arena District (EAD), but foot traffic to the district will extend beyond its doors.
The developers, led by Katz Group, expect annual visits to the cinemas to hit 750,000. The same goes for the planned casino. Both are included in the first phase of the project. This phase, Mr. Katz hopes, will be a huge draw for tourists and locals alike. If you really like it there, you can buy one of the proposed 1,000 residential units. (Boosters for the EAD point out that Toronto's Maple Leaf Square only has 872 units).
Rogers Place is under construction, with people working on the second-level concourse. The ice surface has taken shape. You can almost see the Oilers shutting out the Calgary Flames when the arena opens in 2016.
Office workers will be milling in the plaza in just a few years. Work on the $500-million Stantec Inc. tower is under way, with room to host 3,000 workers when the doors open. The City of Edmonton's $280-million building will house 2,500.
The EAD is being built on ugly parking lots and on the space where a Staples big box store once stood. While the area will be serviced by Edmonton's light rail system, there will still be plenty of places to park. The first phase of development calls for 3,000 underground parking spaces for the public and an additional 350 underground reserved spots at Rogers Place.
Put it all together and phase one will cost $2.6-billion and cover about seven of the district's 10 hectares. Build it and they will come?

On the face of it, it has been a great week for Buffalo sports fans, who are lovably fatalistic about their teams and their city, but who now have a real reason to celebrate at the Buffalo Bills' 2014 home-opener at the Ralph on Sunday.
Terry and Kim Pegula repelled the would-be plunderers of the city's NFL franchise. A team that once seemed certain to depart for richer, more fashionable locations in Toronto or Los Angeles will stay in beleaguered Buffalo: The billionaire owners of the local NHL team stepped up to buy the Bills from the estate of the late Ralph Wilson for a reported bid of $1.4-billion (U.S.).
For once, there is no "wide right" for Buffalo fans, no Brett Hull in the crease. The fancy guys from Toronto and their rocker buddy Jon Bon Jovi, who bid $1.05-billion, finished up the track for a change, along with the huckster Donald Trump. Cue the Genny, brats and beef on weck for the the Ralph's parking lots on Sunday, baby.
Once it became clear that the great moral arbiter, NFL commissioner Roger Goodell, was not about to let the Bills depart for Toronto in the auction sale, the bid from Bon Jovi, Larry Tanenbaum and Edward Rogers was in trouble. Anyone who thought Trump had a serious chance of owning an NFL team knows nothing about the league's history, but team owners have long memories when it comes to Trump's involvement with the USFL in the 1980s.
The Pegulas' bid still has to be approved by three-quarters of the NFL's 32 owners, but that is not expected to be a problem. Terry Pegula has plenty of cash, thanks to the sale of his oil and gas company for $4.7-billion back in 2010. And nothing talks louder in the NFL - or any other league - than money.
Now, without the spectre of the Bills moving hanging over their heads, fans can dream a little. How about a new stadium to replace the bare-bones Ralph, which has always been a pain because it's way out in suburban Orchard Park with only a couple of roads to get you there?
New York State hired consultants to recommend sites for a new stadium, and The Buffalo News reported the list has been pared down to four in Erie County, although the report has yet to be released. But with Pegula in the picture, it is not difficult to imagine a new playpen for the Bills in downtown Buffalo, perhaps right next to the Sabres' HSBC Arena and Pegula's $172-million HarborCenter development.
HarborCenter is supposed to be the catalyst that finally spurs downtown development and ends all those jokes about fires in Buffalo. There are two hockey rinks under construction at HarborCenter along with a Marriott hotel and a big retail building. A football stadium would be the crowning glory.
But - and there always is a but with Pegula - this does not mean the Bills will shed the onfield mediocrity that has dogged them for two decades. Pegula may be the model owner when it comes to paying the bills, but not so much when it comes to building winning teams.
His three-year run as owner of the Sabres has featured one front-office fiasco after another, mostly because he brings a fan's sensibility to his job. Darcy Regier was kept too long as general manager because certain people had Pegula's ear. Those familiar with the team's operations say office politics play far too much a role in the Sabres' day-to-day life.
It looked like Pegula finally had a grip on things when he sent Regier packing and hired franchise icon Pat LaFontaine as president of hockey operations in late 2013, but it did not take long for things to fall apart. Tim Murray was hired as Sabres GM last January, and LaFontaine resigned just three months into the job amid whispers of backstabbings and betrayals in the hockey office.
So rejoice, Bills fans. Your team has been saved from a move up the Queen Elizabeth Way. But don't plan on any return to the glory years of Jim Kelly, Bruce Smith and Thurman Thomas just yet.

Abstract: The Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver calculates a benchmark home price index, which strips out the most expensive homes to give what the board views as a better indicator of pricing trends. Detached homes on Vancouver's west side sold at an index price of $2,282,400 in August, up 9.7 per cent from the same month in 2013. The index price for detached houses in the municipality of West Vancouver has risen 8.4 per cent to $2,018,600 over the past year.

Full text:   Metro Vancouver's hot housing market is scorching when it comes to high-end sales.
Properties selling for $3-million or higher have surged 35 per cent in the Vancouver region, defying predictions of a slowdown after Ottawa shut down the federal immigrant investor program in February.
In the first eight months of this year, there were 572 properties in Metro Vancouver that sold for at least $3-million, including 135 homes for $5-million or more, according to Macdonald Realty Group's compilation of statistics from local real estate boards. In contrast, there were 422 properties that changed hands for $3-million or higher in the first eight months of 2013, including 112 homes that sold for at least $5-million.
At the pace of sales volume so far this year, the luxury real estate market in the area will smash the record of 691 homes that sold for $3-million or higher in 2011.
To stand out in real estate circles on the West Coast, $3-million is the new $1-million. Having a million-dollar home will elicit yawns, not envy, because 55 per cent of detached properties in the City of Vancouver were assessed at $1-million or greater on July 1, 2013, according to research by Andrew Yan, an urban planner with Bing Thom Architects. About 37,800 properties made the cut for the million-dollar club last year.
There had been expectations in the industry that some rich immigrants from China would avoid investing in Metro Vancouver after the federal government scrapped the immigrant investor program, but transactions of at least $3-million are headed toward a new annual high, said Dan Scarrow, vice-president of corporate strategy at Macdonald Realty.
Single-family detached homes dominate posh sales, though there are also some condos and townhouses in the data.
"There is confidence in the Vancouver real estate market.
People within the market itself are trading and there is also money flowing in from outside," Mr. Scarrow said in an interview. "Real estate experts thought there was going to be a slowdown in sales, and I actually thought so as well, but we've been proven wrong."
Macdonald Realty notes that 178 of the firm's 531 sales of detached houses within the City of Vancouver last year, or 33.5 per cent, went to home buyers with ties to China.
Mr. Scarrow, who will be opening a Macdonald Realty office this fall in Shanghai, says the vast majority of buyers have family and/or business links to Vancouver and there are only a small number of strictly offshore investors engaged in speculation. He will spearhead efforts to find prospective buyers for residential properties and seek investors in Vancouver's commercial real estate market and new condo projects.
In many instances, it would be prudent for foreign buyers to invest in commercial properties instead of entering the residential market, especially if houses are left empty, Mr. Scarrow added.
The Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver calculates a benchmark home price index, which strips out the most expensive homes to give what the board views as a better indicator of pricing trends. Detached homes on Vancouver's west side sold at an index price of $2,282,400 in August, up 9.7 per cent from the same month in 2013. The index price for detached houses in the municipality of West Vancouver has risen 8.4 per cent to $2,018,600 over the past year.
Greater Vancouver's total sales for detached homes, condos and townhouses climbed to 2,771 in August, up 10.2 per cent from a year earlier. The Fraser Valley Real Estate Board handled 1,302 transactions last month, up 3.5 per cent from August, 2013.
The Greater Vancouver data include suburbs such as Richmond, Burnaby, Coquitlam and West Vancouver. The Fraser Valley statistics include the sprawling suburb of Surrey.

Full text:   For lawyers, doctors and other entrepreneurs who prefer not to lease, buying a chunk of Class A office space fits the bill
From his rented office in northend Toronto, lawyer Nikolay Chsherbinin can look across the street at the construction of a high-rise tower where he has purchased space for his firm to move into early next year.
Yes, he's buying, not renting, his future office.
Toronto is a top market for residential condo purchases, but only a tiny slice of commercial office space is for sale. Several current office condo projects in the Toronto area illustrate the appeal of ownership for economic and, in some cases, cultural reasons.
"For me, leasing is not a good option," says Mr. Chsherbinin, who founded his four-person firm in 2011. "When you lease, you are paying someone else; you are not building any equity."
Several factors weighed in favour of buying, not leasing, for the 36-year-old Russian-born lawyer.
His boutique law office specializes in employment issues and immigration litigation and he plans to stay small-scale. He regards his North York location, at the crossroads of two subway lines and minutes from Highway 401, as ideal given its potential for future commercial growth.
Not least, his office condo represents a retirement nest egg.
"This is an opportunity for a forward-looking professional," he says of his purchase. At retirement, he says he could sell the unit or lease it to others instead of paying "hundreds of thousands" of dollars in rent for the next 30 years. "Instead, I am generating that amount as equity."
Last year, he purchased one office unit and later an adjacent suite - about 2,400 square feet in total - in the Hullmark Corporate Centre at the southeast corner of Yonge Street and Sheppard Avenue.
The project, a partnership between Tridel Corp. and Hullmark Developments Ltd., is a mixeduse development of about one million square feet with two towers, 35-and 49-storeys high, and a five-storey podium between them for retail.
The first 12 floors of the taller north tower are allocated for 198 office condo units, with a separate entrance on Yonge Street and upscale services that include a concierge and access to a conference room. As with a residential condo building, the office owners have their own board of directors and pay monthly maintenance fees. The south tower has 39 office units.
The developers initially planned to lease the office units, but drew little interest from renters, according to Jim Ritchie, senior vice-president of sales and marketing for Tridel. In 2010, in a change of strategy, the developers offered the units for sale. That year, buyers snapped up 137 of 198 units.
Today, with occupancy set for November, only three of 237 units in total remain unsold in the Class A buildings. An average unit of 845 square feet sells for $515,000, Mr. Ritchie says.
Though pleased by the near sellout, he describes office ownership as a narrow slice of the real estate market.
"I don't think this can apply anywhere and everywhere," he warns.
"We tried to address users who were more entrepreneurial and smaller in scale and who wanted an upmarket, triple-A environment and liked the whole idea about ownership," he says, with the marketing focus on doctors, lawyers and other professionals.
"We didn't go out to chase big users because they were not going to buy these things."
Though office condos are a niche segment of the commercial market, Mr. Ritchie says "we would do this again under the right circumstances," citing key factors such as a building's location and the profile of potential buyers.
James McKellar, professor of real estate and infrastructure at the Schulich School of Business at York University, says that for some, businesses office condos often "don't make sense economically" because it may be cheaper to lease than to buy in certain locations. Others may not want to commit to ownership when company operations could expand or shrink over time.
One part of this niche market has drawn interest from Torontoarea immigrants, especially from China, South Korea and Iran, who value owning a long-term asset. "For what you get for your money in Toronto, [it] is extraordinary from their point of view," says Prof. McKellar.
Farzam Jalili, president of the Professional Iranian Canadian Real Estate Association, says "ownership is very important in our culture." Self-employed professionals, he notes, "normally go for a freehold or free-standing premises for their own uses rather than to rent."
Mr. Jalili, owner of Real Home Realty Inc., in Richmond Hill, Ont., says he knows of young professionals who have purchased in Hullmark Corporate Centre and at suburban locations along Yonge Street's northern corridor.
While office condos often are located in the suburbs, one developer is bringing the concept to downtown Toronto.
"Toronto is really the [residential] condo capital of the world, but not for commercial condos," says Patrick Quigley, president of St. Thomas Commercial Developments, with the project at 7 St.
Thomas St. his company's first commercial condo. "It is completely foreign to them [local buyers] but quite common in New York, Chicago, London and everywhere in Europe."
Located just south of the city's toney Yorkville district and on the same site as the company's recently-completed high-end residential condo tower, the office condo is a nine-storey, 93,000square-foot luxury building designed by Hariri Pontarini Architects and scheduled to open in the spring of 2016.
The Class A office building of curving fritted (porous) glass tucks behind six 19th century townhouses incorporated into the project. Priced from $450,000, the units appeal to established companies who want a long-term investment in a prestige location, says Mr. Quigley.
The project is about 50 per cent sold, but Mr. Quigley concedes the concept is unfamiliar to potential buyers.
"The sellout of this has been arduous because it is an education process," he says. "Now that we have started construction we have had a lot of activity and some who came by a year ago are coming back again."
Back in North York, Mr. Chsherbinin concedes the office condo option "is not for everybody" but he remains "very excited" about his decision to move across the street.

Abstract: In a bid to bolster the production of domestic programs, the CBC and others suggested that profitable online streaming services such as Netflix, which has an estimated four million Canadian subscribers, should have to pay into the Canada Media Fund, which fosters and finances the production of Canadian content, just as local broadcasters do. But Netflix counters in its submission that because it is Americanowned, it can't access the CMF to create its own programs.

Full text:   On Monday morning, dozens of executives from some of the country's largest television companies will file into a nondescript grey office building in Gatineau, Que., and begin a process that could radically change how Canadians watch TV.
Each day for the next two weeks, scores more of executives, industry group representatives and private citizens will flock to the same place. They will all be appearing before a special hearing convened by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, or CRTC, casually dubbed "Let's Talk TV."
The hearing puts just about everything about the TV business up for discussion. That includes unbundling cable packages and allowing "pick-and-pay" options, debating whether transmitters that broadcast some stations for free over the air should be shut down and considering changes to the rules that promote and protect Canadian content.
Already some 10,000 Canadians have filed comments to the commission, and representatives from 118 companies, organizations and individuals are expected to appear.
Many viewers like Elizabeth Moore of Winnipeg have been blunt about their frustrations. "Why is it so difficult to remove ALL bundling and allow consumers to choose only those channels they want?" Ms. Moore wrote to the CRTC. "If I want a blue shirt, I don't also have to purchase one in red, yellow, green, etc."
The five-member panel tasked with crafting new rules knows it needs to strike a delicate balance, driving change and increasing choice without badly upsetting television's fragile ecosystem. The industry is already under considerable pressure. Its revenue model is strained as advertising spending sags and migrates to other media. And a set of online steaming services have created new competition for viewers, often operating unregulated from outside Canada.
And there is political pressure too.
Nearly a year ago, the federal government used its Speech from the Throne to take aim at cable TV, saying it "believes Canadian families should be able to choose the combination of television channels they want."
Choice in channels has emerged as the hearing's central issue, but unbundling won't happen so easily. Television broadcasters and distributors are pushing back, arguing that pick-and-pay could be more expensive for many viewers and might kill niche channels. Ideas to sustain struggling local TV stations are also up in the air, as are suggestions that foreign streaming services like Netflix should help pay to support Canadian programs.
"The system is threatened like never before," BCE Inc., which owns Bell Media [as well as 15 per cent of The Globe and Mail], wrote in a submission to the CRTC this summer. "Changing consumer habits have provided a glimpse of the future. We have been watching closely, and we know the Canadian television system needs to adapt."
The CRTC appears determined that the status quo will not survive, and commission chairman Jean-Pierre Blais has said "major changes" are in the works, calling this "a watershed public hearing."
"We're not just floating ideas here," Mr. Blais said in an interview.
The outcome of the process is far from clear. But in an effort to focus a sprawling list of considerations, the CRTC has released a working document, known internally as "the straw man." It outlines four main themes to explore: Maximizing consumer choice, fostering local programming, nurturing strong Canadian programs and policing relations between broadcast distributors and programmers.
The "straw man" contains 29 tentative proposals that would thoroughly disrupt television's business model, and even industry insiders are having a hard time envisaging the result.
"The problem with the hearing right now is that there are so many variable elements that it is impossible to reach a conclusion about what's good, what's bad, without knowing what is the most likely thing to be adopted," said Michael Hennessy, president and chief executive officer of the Canadian Media Production Association (CMPA), which represents independent producers.
"Your brain starts to blow up."
The right to choose
Precisely how much a pick-andpay system would affect consumers and the television business would depend largely on how broadly it is introduced. A CRTC proposal from the straw-man document would make any "discretionary" channel available for customers to choose one by one, on top of a package of basic channels.
Broadcast distributors such as Bell, Rogers Communications Inc. and Shaw Communications Inc. might also be required to offer build-your-own bundles, but could still have pre-assembled packages as they do now - for example, Rogers offers the popular HBO Canada in a package with numerous movie channels for $21.05 a month.
But cable and satellite distributors oppose an unbridled pickand-pay system, especially if it were paired with a proposed "skinny basic" option that would force them to offer a simple set of perhaps a dozen or so local and community-based networks plus the provincial legislature channel at a price capped at $20 to $30 a month. According to a CRTC study, an average "must-buy" basic package among Canadian and American carriers currently has about 50 networks, but can have twice that many.
Bell and Rogers argue that their own research shows there is little demand for a skinny basic option, and say it could lead to higher bills for most consumers, as the bundling of larger packages allows the fixed costs of running a television service to be spread more widely among customers.
"Even if it's 2, 3, 4, 5 per cent [of subscribers] that goes down to skinny basic, that will force a loss on basic which everyone else will have to make up for on the bigger packages," said Mirko Bibic, the chief legal and regulatory officer for Bell, which opposes shrinking basic packages.
Rogers has said it would accept a skinny basic option (if it includes core U.S. networks ABC, NBC, CBS, FOX and PBS), but suggests distributors should only be forced to offer 50 per cent of their channels à la carte, keeping some expensive networks bundled.
South of the border, companies are watching the debate closely, and some are more blunt about the perils of unbundling. In a CRTC submission, U.S. media giant Viacom Inc. says mandating pick-and-pay would be "a consumer welfare destroying death spiral," and "may cause programming services to re-examine whether it continues to make business sense" to distribute channels in Canada.
The CRTC's own study on pickand-pay notes that if the channels in a bundle happen to be "the ones the consumer wants, it is about $2 cheaper per channel to buy them in the package. So they are offered at a considerable premium."
And Mr. Blais agrees that giving consumers more choice may require tradeoffs. "I've never promised pick-and-pay would be cheaper," he said.
Even so, many stakeholders expect that some form of "pickand-pay" system is virtually a done deal, not least because of the signals from the federal government. Canadian Heritage Minister Shelly Glover said in an interview that her government remains determined to create more choice for viewers, and that the rapid change in the way people are watching television "isn't something that can be ignored."
The CRTC has an arm's-length relationship with the federal government, so Ottawa's involvement in Let's Talk TV "is limited," she said.
"But we were pretty clear about what we're asking for," she added.
A blow to the bottom line
Another knock-on effect of a pickand-pay model could be the demise of several of the hundreds of channels currently on offer, companies warn.
Many specialty channels rely on subscriber fees and, in the current system, a subscriber may choose a bundle to get one specific channel. Over time, they might watch the others or they might not, but each channel earns a fee.
Family Channel offers "a cautionary example," according to the channel's owner, Halifaxbased DHX Media Ltd., a production and distribution company.
The station is commercial-free, relying on subscriber fees, and carried by 60 per cent of Canadian television customers, by virtue of being included in popular bundles. But pick-and-pay would undercut its business model by reducing its subscriber base, the company said in a submission, forcing "significant price increases" that might turn off even devoted viewers.
Meanwhile, broadcasters warn that another proposal could also badly hurt profitability for conventional TV stations.
Networks that rely on advertising could suffer huge holes in their revenues if the CRTC moves ahead with a proposal on simultaneous substitution. Commonly called "Simsub," it describes a rule that allows Canadian television stations to swap a U.S. signal with its own, including its Canadian-bought ads, when the two networks air the same show. It is the reason Canadians watching the Super Bowl don't see U.S. commercials. Some consumers have complained that Simsub disrupts programs if the TV signals are not synchronized.
To broadcasters' dismay, the CRTC has proposed either eliminating Simsub entirely, or prohibiting it during live events like sports and awards shows, which are prime real estate for substitution.
A study from Armstrong Consulting, commissioned by Bell, Rogers and Shaw, estimates that ending Simsub would have reduced ad revenues for English conventional TV broadcasters by $242-million to $262-million in 2012-13, and cost them another $173-million to $191-million in "secondary economic impacts." It concluded that the loss in revenues would have resulted in decreased spending on Canadian programming by up to $122-million.
"Simsub is a way of protecting programming rights," said Ken Engelhart, senior vice-president of regulatory at Rogers. Without protection, "one of the last profitable parts of Canadian over-theair television is gone."
No more free local TV?
Greater choice may be appealing to consumers, but it has already proven problematic for local television. According to CRTC figures, private local television stations' revenues fell by $100-million between 2011 and 2012.
In large part, that was because competition from online services and specialty channels has taken a bite out of local TV's business model. Stations that once had a captive audience in nearby communities are now struggling to keep up with national and foreign content, and their ad revenues are falling.
Local programming "matters an awful lot" to Canadians, said Mr. Bibic of Bell, which owns 30 local stations that employ roughly 2,000 people. But in the current system, "we're not making money."
The desire for more choice is being driven by the rising "individualism of how people consume content," Mr. Blais said, which is bringing about a "sea change" in the television business.
As of mid-2014, 11.5 million of Canada's 13.9 million households have a paid TV subscription, according to the Digital Life Canada Quarterly Tracking report. But 57 per cent of Canadians with Internet connections now watch long-form video or TV online, on 35 million Internet-enabled screens such as smartphones, tablets and laptops, which now surpass TV sets in number.
"That means more fragmentation and competition for video entertainment," said Kaan Yigit, president of Solutions Research Group, who also sees a generational shift in viewing preferences.
Bell has argued that broadcasters should be allowed to shut off over-the-air transmitters, which allow free access to a number of stations for a dwindling audience, but are expensive to maintain. The CRTC is tentatively proposing that local over-the-air signals could be shut down and moved to basic cable or satellite services instead, but some broadcast distributors such as Rogers and Shaw disagree, saying such a step would be premature.
Ditching over-the-air signals would "further remove a substantial sector of the population from the broadcasting system," Ryerson University researcher Gregory Taylor wrote in his submission - including many elderly and lowincome Canadians who use antennas.
On a hand-written postcard, Sudbury, Ont. resident Joan Mulcahy implored the CRTC not to "forget those of us who, because of limited financial resources, depend on over-the-air transmission. It would be a shame for our isolation to increase because we no longer had access to television."
Keeping Canada on air
Conventional national TV networks, like their local counterparts, are struggling with a business model based on advertising revenue. Rogers forecasts a $45-million loss for its City channels in its submission, although it hopes to close some of that gap with new revenue from hockey broadcasts.
In a bid for more flexibility to manage their bottom lines, several broadcasters are asking for the rules around Canadian content to be relaxed. Rogers wants restrictions removed that force it to air Canadian programs during prime time, while Bell and Shaw want requirements around the number of hours of Canadian shows their stations air relaxed, promising to concentrate their spending on fewer, higher-quality shows.
The CRTC's working document takes a less radical stance, proposing to maintain the requirement that Canadian shows be aired in prime time evening hours, but to scrap daytime exhibition rules.
In a bid to bolster the production of domestic programs, the CBC and others suggested that profitable online streaming services such as Netflix, which has an estimated four million Canadian subscribers, should have to pay into the Canada Media Fund, which fosters and finances the production of Canadian content, just as local broadcasters do. But Netflix counters in its submission that because it is Americanowned, it can't access the CMF to create its own programs. Paying what it has provocatively labelled a "Netflix tax" would "see new media cross-subsidizing old media," the company argues.
Television producers are also wary of new rules concerning Canadian content and pushing for stronger regulations to support Canadian TV. But some fear the CRTC will relax Canadian content restrictions as a concession to broadcasters and distributors that stand to lose substantial money on other proposals like pick-andpay.
"That has always been my worst nightmare," said Mr. Hennessy of the CMPA.
At this point, Mr. Blais says "the money's there" to create good Canadian content. And insiders insist the CRTC is determined not to pull the financial rug from underneath broadcasters and distributors that are already struggling to adapt to online competition and changing viewing habits.
This summer, Bell Media cut more than 100 jobs, citing financial pressure. And earlier this year, new data showed the first hint that a substantial number of Canadians are cutting the cord on their cable and satellite connections, as total subscribers fell by more than 7,600.
In 2013, the weekly hours Canadians spent watching traditional television dipped slightly, while Internet TV viewing increased.
The biggest decline on traditional sets was among 18 to 34-year-olds, who watched nearly 4 per cent less TV, the CRTC says.
In pushing for more choice, the federal government also highlighted the importance of "protecting Canadian jobs," but Rogers' Mr. Engelhart said that ambition may prove far-fetched.
"If this [hearing] is not done delicately, and well, we're going to have job losses in the cultural sector," he said.
The CRTC plans to have a new framework in place on Dec. 15, 2015, although some see that timeline as optimistic. Pick-andpay should bring consumers more choice, but some TV bills may rise, some channels will likely die out, and the Canadian TV landscape could be adapting for years to come.
And that, Mr. Blais says, is why the hearings starting Monday are important: So viewers and companies can have their say before the commission makes any final decisions.
"There will be consequences, obviously," Mr. Blais said. "But what we want to make sure is that Canadians, in a dynamic marketplace, are in the driver's seat."
BOOSTING CHOICE
What's the issue?
Beyond "basic" TV packages, television providers tend to offer their channels in bundles, which frustrates viewers who want to pay only for channels they actually watch. The CRTC is considering forcing companies to offer all channels beyond a basic package à la carte, plus build-yourown bundles and a stripped-down, cheaper basic package.
What's at stake?
Ottawa has said it wants to give consumers a pick-and-pay option. But broadcast distributors say they will take a major financial hit if it is implemented, and argue that the choice will actually end up costing consumers more because bundling spreads out fixed costs. It could also signal the death of a number of specialty channels that rely on fees from subscribers who buy their channels in packages.
SUSTAINING LOCAL TV
What's the issue?
Revenues for local television stations are tumbling as their viewership declines amid growing competition from online streaming services. To control costs, some networks say the costly over-the-air transmitters they maintain to broadcast local stations on free signals should be shut down.
What's at stake?
The survival of some local news and programming, which is still popular and vital to a host of Canadians, but bleeding millions in revenue. Many people still watch over-the-air TV, particularly older and lower-income viewers. BCE Inc. has suggested charging a wholesale fee for local channels to generate revenue to support them, but so far the CRTC does not seem inclined to agree.
CANADIAN CONTENT
What's the issue?
To ensure Canadian programs aren't squeezed off the dial by popular American shows, the CRTC has rules mandating how much broadcasters and distributors must spend to help create Canadian content in both official languages, and how often they must air those shows- it varies, but some companies have to broadcast at least eight hours a week between 7 p.m. and 11 p.m., for example.
What's at stake?
Broadcasters and distributors are looking for Canadian content rules to be relaxed as pressure grows on their stations' profitability. But producers want CanCon rules strengthened.
CORPORATE RELATIONS
What's the issue?
With the consolidation of the Canadian television sector - five companies account for 85 per cent of Canadian broadcasting revenues - the CRTC enforces a code of conduct for large, vertically integrated companies that own and distribute media. That framework helps shape the way cable and satellite companies negotiate rights with programmers.
What's at stake?
The CRTC is proposing that the code be extended to fit a pick-and-pay system, adding new restrictions on the tactics that can be used to negotiate broadcast rights, to protect abuse by vertically integrated giants and smaller players. BCE Inc. wants existing rules loosened so market forces can drive negotiations, but the Competition Bureau argues that5 such safeguards are necessary. Ultimately, these deals help set the costs to consumers.
STREAMING AND NETFLIX
What's the issue?
The growing popularity of online video and American-owned TV and movie streaming services like Netflix are the elephant in the hearing room. The CRTC says 29 per cent of English speakers had subscribed to Netflix as of 2013, and Canadian TV companies fear their subscribers may cut the cord on conventional television in favour of cheaper online options.
What's at stake?
Television networks and distributors made a combined $15.5-billion in revenue last year, and must combat the streaming threat to keep subscribers loyal. Last month, Rogers and Shaw jointly launched an ambitious streaming competitor, called Shomi. But some, including the CBC, want foreign services like Netflix to fork over some of their revenue to support Canadian content - an idea Netflix flatly rejects.

LISTING AGENT
Cathy Methven, Sutton Group Old Mill Realty Inc.
The Action : Nestled near the Islington Golf Club, Thomas Riley Park and Mimico Creek, the Barclay Terraces had several units on offer this summer. But few were as large as this three-bedroomplus-solarium unit, and the sellers believed they could get the best price by delaying the review of bids. As it happened, a strong early offer ended the selling process before the day scheduled to consider competing bids.
What They Got : A few years ago, updates were done in the two bathrooms and kitchen of this roughly 30-year-old suite.
The lake and CN Tower can be seen from southeast windows in the solarium and living and dining space, which is visible from a kitchen with breakfast bar seating at the pass through window.
Daily routines run smoothly with ensuite laundry facilities, locker and parking, plus monthly fee of $655 diverted towards the cost of utilities, cable and recreational facilities.
The Agent's Take : "There is always a demand for the suites that offer great views in this building, and the fact that some have interior solariums rather than a balcony, as was the case here, is a plus to those buyers who would rather have the yearround use of the space," agent Cathy Methven said.
"Although all suites have at least two bedrooms, this suite was one of the rare threebedroom models with almost 1,275 square feet and two full baths."
Many buyers also liked they could give up driving.
"This suite is located in the Barclay Terrace complex, a location immensely popular with locals who have empty nested out of homes and prize the location, which is within walking distance of the Islington subway, a pharmacy and grocery store," Ms. Methven said.
"The award-winning gardens and numerous amenities - tennis, pool, gym and squash - fit all lifestyles, but the quiet reputation and well-managed finances enhance its popularity."

Full text:   For years, Chinese property owners have enjoyed a free ride to wealth driven by scorching growth in home prices and a lack of property taxes to whittle away the gains. A condo in Beijing has been like a piece of gold: an asset that can sit and gain value, with little cost of ownership.
But three years ago, Chinese authorities began taxing a small fraction of the country's real estate, with pilot projects in two major urban areas, Shanghai and Chongqing.
Now Chinese authorities say they are moving to rapidly roll out property taxes nationwide, in a bid to reshape the country's financial structure and curb some of the incentives for local governments to trammel the rights of farmers and others left behind by China's extraordinary wealth gains.
Last week, China's state-owned People's Daily newspaper said the country "is likely to introduce a nationwide property tax as early as next year." Citing officials with the National People's Congress, China's rubber-stamp legislature, it said a draft law will be completed this year.
Several experts reached by the Globe and Mail cast doubt on the timeline, saying so much work remains to be done that a full rollout may take several years; next year may merely bring more trial cities.
But it is clear China is moving with some haste to bring forward a new tax regime that stands to upend the way cities work.
Today, Chinese cities depend on the sale of property rights to developers for much of their income. But that income is unstable and creates many problems. Among the most visible is the conflict it creates between municipalities and people who own houses and farmland, which are often appropriated by municipalities hungry for money. There is another problem: it's a revenue model with a shelf life.
"The sustainability of municipal finances based on land sales - whether it's 25 or 40 per cent of municipal revenues - that model is limited by the very fact that land is limited," said Michael Klibaner, head of greater China research for Jones Lang LaSalle Limited, a commercial real estate information provider.
Mr. Klibaner believes a Chinawide residential property tax is "inevitable." But he points to the lack of a proper registration database as one reason it may take some time. In many cities, individual districts maintain independent property registries that cannot 'talk' to each other. The lack of national database standards on basic data, like who owns which property, is an obstacle that will likely take some time to resolve.
There are other problems. Historically speaking, property taxes are not new to China. But property taxes largely disappeared when Mao Zedong and the Communists took control of China in 1949 and nationalized its assets.
Chinese citizens have grown unaccustomed to the idea, using second and third properties as fee-free savings accounts. They "really don't understand this kind of tax," said Ren Qiang, an associate professor at Beijing's Central University of Finance and Economics.
Another reason for Chinese leadership to take it slowly: The question of which taxes go to pay for local bridges and streetsweeping is surprisingly important.
"With regular, constant oversight from local residents, accountability of local officials is set up to taxpayers, not to bosses in the higher level governments," Mr. Ren and a pair of other researchers wrote in an academic article last year. "More public choice in local services plants the seed for direct election of top local officials."
China "needs this kind of tax," Mr. Ren said.
It wants it, too, as a way to constrain exploding property prices that have made large cities, and even many smaller ones, unaffordable to all but the wealthy.
"One of the goals is to lower housing prices, and also to reduce speculation," said Li Zhanjun, a researcher with the Shanghai-based E-House China R & D Institute.
But that depends, in part, on the way it's put together. In Taiwan, for instance, the system is so prone to manipulation that the owner of a $1-million (U.S.)
house is unlikely to pay more than $500 a year in property tax.
In Shanghai and Chongqing, the regulations were carefully written to affect only the very wealthiest with the most expansive property holdings. By some estimations, only a few thousand people actually pay property tax in Shanghai, a city of 24.5 million.
"The trials in the two cities have failed," Mr. Li said.
Still, even some homeowners say they are willing to accept a higher tax burden if it means living in cities with more accountable government and better municipal services.
Today, "many of those living in communities are, like us, not satisfied with the service we're getting," said Peter Hu, who owns two homes in Shanghai. "The money they collect should serve us - improve traffic and improve peoples' lives."

Full text:   Thomas Fung's Fairchild Group spans media, real estate and food rooted in an Asia-Canada connection
Thomas Fung's fantastical new movie script goes something like this.
A kung-fu actress is brought to Hollywood from mainland China so she can party with directors and producers at a riverside mansion. At the same time, a boxer from the Bronx is working there as a caterer, ferrying supplies in a boat from a luxurious house across the river. Bored, she flees with him to the other side.
Chased by security guards, they take shelter in a private jet on the property, and eventually take off. They crash on a desert island, and as the two navigate their cultural differences, hijinks ensue - including battling a crocodile.
"It's a love story with kung-fu and boxing," said a gleeful Mr. Fung, the founder of the Fairchild Group, over a bowl of Taiwanese beef noodle soup at Chef Hung's in the Aberdeen Centre in Richmond, B.C.
If the plot sounds a bit unbelievable, consider that almost everything Mr. Fung attempted in his career seemed far-fetched in the beginning before it paid off. Now he is worth about $400-million, not including his real estate holdings.
It's thanks to the transpacific empire that is the Fairchild Group, a conglomerate he built to span Chinese-language media, international partnerships and global retail franchises, real estate interests, a pâtisserie chain, a flight school, and import and e-commerce businesses.
Born in Hong Kong and now based in Vancouver, Mr. Fung has become a uniquely Canadian success story. He acts as a cultural liaison for other executives on his travels through Asia. Business is the pursuit of long-standing passions like his new script, which he is working on with a Chinese director.
"He's a small businessman on a huge scale," says Michael Francis, a businessman and chair emeritus of the Vancouver Film Festival. "He's as interested in trying it in Richmond as Hong Kong or Beijing."
It was Mr. Fung who, while in Taipei, tasted Chef Hung's and became convinced it would be a global success. He's opened several restaurants in Vancouver and is now building locations in China on a seven-year plan to eventually take the noodle restaurant public.
He also wants to (eventually) have a public offering for his high-end pâtisserie chain, which is expanding as Aime in China and as St. Germain in Vancouver.
It has contracts with airlines' firstclass service out of Vancouver and various hotels in Richmond.
Mr. Fung started Chef Hung's at the Aberdeen Centre, a pioneering Asian mall he built (and then destroyed and rebuilt) in Richmond, just outside of Vancouver, a community he has helped transform since the late 1980s.
The mall has dumpling shops, a branch of the popular Japanese izakaya (casual after-work bar) Guu, Hong Kong fashion brands and a hugely popular "100 Yen" discount retailer called Daiso. It has become a laboratory of sorts for his new ventures - he said he owns 15 per cent of the mall's 200 stores - and lures locals (Richmond is roughly 50 per cent Chinese) as well as tourists from Korea, China and Japan.
When Mr. Fung first tried to get tenants in the 1980s, he placed ads in San Francisco, New York, Los Angeles and Toronto, hoping for tenants to be part of his ambitious project - the first multicultural mall in North America, he says. Six months passed, but he heard nothing.
"They were not interested in Vancouver," says Mr. Fung. "They thought we were a small town."
But Mr. Fung - whose father arrived in Hong Kong after fleeing the mainland and then dabbled in foreign exchange before founding a merchant bank and making a fortune - correctly predicted the large influx of Hong Kong residents who would land in Vancouver and Richmond in the tense years before the handover of the city-state from Britain back to China.
"I said, sooner or later they will come," Mr. Fung says. "And that will be an opportunity for business."
But no brands wanted to take the risk along with him. He offered tenants 51-per-cent stakes, with the ability to walk away if the venture failed, or to buy back his stake - with no interest - if it succeeded. He did the legwork: hiring, renovations, operation.
The Aberdeen Centre was a success, and tenants bought into Mr. Fung's dream. Western brands have so far "shied away," although Mercedes is opening up.
In the early 1990s, Mr. Fung bought two money-losing Chinese-language broadcasters and began building out Fairchild's media assets - which includes Mandarin and Cantonese radio stations, two TV networks and a lifestyle magazine. He said owning media would create synergies with his retail and real estate holdings. And it has worked - so much so that one opponent in a regulatory hearing in 2009 said Mr. Fung might end up with a "monopoly" in Chinese-language broadcasting, and that Fairchild's news reports make "favourable comments with regard to (Fairchild's) businesses and does not remain neutral."
Gabriel Yiu, a Hong Kong-born activist who once ran for the provincial NDP, said Mr. Fung is a "pioneer," whose mall was a "big factor in turning Richmond into the most Chinese city outside Asia," although it has also contributed to the decline of Vancouver's Chinatown.
Mr. Fung, who says he slept in stairwells as his father toiled at odd jobs in the godowns of Hong Kong harbour, says his journalists occasionally show a bit of bias against mainland China in their reports. This, he says, reflects anti-mainland views held by many ordinary Hong Kong citizens, and many Hong Kong-born people in Vancouver - but which are not generally held by members of the more "pragamatic," transpacific business class, like himself.
It seems Mr. Fung earnestly wants to achieve much broader appeal. He wants his mall to be a "cosmopolitan" and "Asian/Western" establishment, but is effectively tied to Chinese by broadcast licences that prevent him from producing anything of substance in English or French. To find a challenge, he is now pushing deeper into China, pursuing his passions and philanthropy - and preparing his son Joseph to take over the business.
"At my stage, I don't really push for any projects," said Mr. Fung, who is 63. "It's more for my son."
His friends aren't too sure.
"I don't think he'll pass it on nearly as quickly as he thinks he will," Mr. Francis said. "He loves his life."

Installing green features is often an expensive upgrade - if available at all - in new developments. But one of the largest Energy Star builders in Southwestern Ontario is constructing every one of its homes with ecofriendly features as standard, saving buyers money both upfront and in the future at its low-rise community in Brantford, just 20 minutes from Hamilton.
"Because we're building a whole community of Energy Star homes, we're not charging a premium for it, whereas a lot of builders would have to include a premium," says Paul A. Golini Jr., executive vice-president and cofounder of Empire Communities.
"Energy Star is really about a higher-quality product ... but at the same time, there are energyefficient savings so that the cost of running the home for the user is lower, so it's a win-win."
The builder has released the third and fourth phases within the west end of the masterplanned community, called Wyndfield, where more than 1,000 green homes were completed over the past decade.
While green features will range from increased insulation to improved indoor air quality; watersaving fixtures to conserving natural resources, phase-four residents can walk to an existing school, park, trail and future retail space.
Just outside the project's brick and stone entrance are additional attractions. "We're in a developing area of Brantford in the south end with easy access to [Highway] 403, so we're appealing to both local residents, as well as people coming from outside Brantford," Mr. Golini notes.
"[Plus] we have easy access to all the new great sports facilities at the Wayne Gretzky sports recreation centre, which is 10 minutes away."
Five fully furnished model homes showcase features and floor plans available for the freehold townhouses and detached homes on 30-, 36- and 44-foot lots.
Occupancy for new purchases in phases three and four start February, 2015.

Full text:   Two-storey addition on top of Thompson Rivers University building gives B.C. law school sweeping style and space
Academic architecture isn't what it used to be.
For many years, stretching back to the 1950s, universities and colleges in this country and beyond were constrained by the notion that buildings of higher education could work only on three or fewer storeys. According to some experts, however, that concept is now as outdated as the abacus.
"I would say it's totally an academic planning prejudice that universities can only work in three floors," says Don Schmitt, principal at Diamond Schmitt Architects Inc. in Toronto, a firm that has worked with 40 colleges and universities and has designed roughly 100 academic buildings over the past decade and a half.
"It's partly because that's been the tradition across many campuses. There's some vague idea that we have to accommodate the flows of people, that at the bell between this lecture and that lecture, there's 250 people flowing out and 250 people flowing in.
"Well, a typical office tower, say the TD Centre [in Toronto] that has 3,000-4,000 people working in one tower, how do they move them in and out?" While some schools have adopted a high-rise philosophy, such as Chicago's Roosevelt University with its 32-storey all-inclusive "vertical campus" served by highspeed elevators, others start to feel a little uneasy when the idea of even a sixth storey is discussed.
Case in point was the work Diamond Schmitt recently completed at the University of Ottawa, where it designed a 15storey faculty of social science building on a tiny footprint of land squeezed in between the existing five-storey Vanier Hall building and the Rideau Canal.
"Vanier Hall, everybody thought of it as fronting the canal, and we did a little work and said there is a ... building site here that could be made to work and it could integrate with Vanier Hall," Mr. Schmitt says. "They said academic buildings don't make sense on 15 floors."
But the building opened two years ago to widespread acclaim, offering five storeys of undergraduate classroom and lecture space, with seminar, office and research space occupying the upper floors.
But given the increasing complexities that come with operating in an urban environment, responding to growing student bodies and the demands for collaborative learning methods, utilizing the space most effectively is of the utmost importance.
"I think we are mindful of the footprint that we have because we are in an urban setting," says Alan Wildeman, president and vice-chancellor of the University of Windsor. "We don't have a lot of land around us and so we haven't gone much higher than three or four storeys but we are mindful of the fact that we need to create compact spaces that maximize the land that we've got."
That overriding principle was certainly at the forefront when Diamond Schmitt was asked to redesign an existing academic building at Thompson Rivers University in Kamloops to accommodate a new law school. Though space wasn't necessarily a problem, there was a feeling among the faculty that the campus had started to sprawl, and that it needed to be refocused around a central core.
"When we did our campus master plan, one of the principles of that master plan is we wanted to create greater densification of the core of campus," says Matt Milovick, vice-president of finance and administration at TRU.
TRU had an existing circular piece of topography designed by famed Canadian landscape architect Cornelia Oberlander, which Mr. Schmitt saw as a crossroads for students. Diamond Schmitt built the university library there a few years ago, and the firm decided to re-emphasize that area of campus when it came to the neighbouring law school, too.
The existing multi-use two-storey 1970s structure, known as Old Main, which Mr. Schmitt fairly describes as a "bit of a beast in the middle of campus," was short on style, but long on function.
The university decided that rather than knocking it down, it would add to it. Instead of increasing the footprint horizontally, Diamond Schmitt went vertical instead, adding another two storeys.
"The old building being two storeys and fairly low, it didn't really take advantage of the views," Mr. Milovick says.
The extra height allows law students to capitalize on the breathtaking vista presented by the mountains that surround the campus, particularly Mount Peter and Mount Paul. They became the inspiration for the undulating wooden roof that echoes the landscape.
A painting of Mount Paul by Group of Seven artist A.Y. Jackson gave Mr. Schmitt what he calls the "aha moment" and it also helped him avoid putting a "flat pancake on a flat pancake."
In addition to the law library and reading rooms housed in the new space, which officially opened in June, the extra room also allowed for teaching areas to be reinterpreted. The lecture theatre, for instance, was designed following discussions with local First Nations people, who viewed it more as a gathering space as opposed to a more Western view of a talking head in front of a group of students.
"It's that whole issue of how is the lecture space changing to accommodate new ways of thinking about teaching and how is academic space overall changing to accommodate the collegiality," Mr. Schmitt says. "How are universities, particularly urban universities, taking advantage of diminishing campus space?
They're going more compact and taller, partly a real estate circumstance of making more effective use of the site they have available."
For Thompson Rivers University, the result is one that takes maximum advantage of the landscape around it, and while it is hoped the new facility will enhance the learning experience, the increased height and stature of the building is one that the faculty hopes will offer greater exposure to the school across Canada.
"You think of universities that have iconic buildings," Mr. Milovick says. "OCAD's got the Sharp Centre of Design and anybody that knows that building [with its table-top structure] relates it to OCAD; Queen's has their clock tower, the University of Guelph has [historic] Johnston Hall.
"I think in the future when people see this building, as it becomes more well-known, people are going to immediately identify it as 'That's TRU.' That is the building that will define us in people's minds."
TRU LAW TRANSFORMED
The additional two storeys provide 45,000 square feet of space, housing the law library, reading room, lecture theatre and offices.
Roof panels were prefabricated and made of glued laminated timber beams, called glulam, wood joists and plywood sheathing.
The 122-metre-long roof was installed in just seven weeks in the summer of 2012.
$20.2-million - total cost of the addition to Old Main.
Existing two-storey building was reclad in cement-board planks to form curving bands that reference First Nations basket-weaving traditions.

Abstract: Ensuring his daughter's smooth transition into a local school is part of why Andrew Geldard is currently renting an apartment in the Junction while waiting for his condo to be built. "That way, if she starts school before it's ready, she'll already be in the right one," said the 37year-old, who bought a 1,000square-foot unit in the Duke condos, a seven-storey apartment and townhouse complex at the corner of Dundas Street West and Indian Grove Avenue.

Full text:   More and more families are choosing an urban lifestyle. Now they're waiting for the services they need to catch up
Eight years ago, Hazel Liau's husband bought a 1,268square-foot, pre-construction condo in the CityPlace complex at Spadina Avenue and Front Street.
He spent two years in his bachelor pad before Ms. Liau moved in. Now, the two-bedroom-plus den unit is a family home for the couple, their two daughters, a French bulldog and a school of saltwater fish in a 300-gallon tank.
Their evolution has been mirrored in the neighbourhood around them.
"It feels like the kid population has maybe tripled in the past four years," says Ms. Liau, 33, who's currently on maternity leave with her eight-month-old second daughter.
She's almost right. Between 2006 and 2011, her Trinity-Spadina ward has seen a 20-per-cent jump in the number of under-five yearold residents - and since the majority of the ward lives in multiunit buildings, it's safe to say a whole lot of those kids live in condos.
Toronto's condo boom has kicked off a real-time experiment in ultra-urban living, and one of the most controversial aspects of the shift is whether the city is ready for the influx of high-rise families like Ms. Liau's.
With 21 buildings and roughly 7,500 units, CityPlace is perhaps the fastest-burbling test tube of them all. Ever since the developer Concord Adex began dropping towers onto the site in 2000, CityPlace has taken a lot of criticism for lacking sufficient infrastructure or amenities for its population. In some ways, the neighbourhood is catching up: In exchange for allowing extrahigh towers, the city got developers around the Fort York neighbourhood to kick in cash to build parks, like the Canoe Landing splash pad that Ms. Liau's daughters love, and a modern, high-tech library that opened earlier this year to an immediate influx of condo-dwelling families. "We use it all the time - everything's so new," says Ms. Liau.
Like many of her neighbours, Ms. Liau says she prefers a small downtown space to a big suburban home: She grew up in Brampton and spent much of her 20s commuting the 90 minutes there and back. Here, her husband can walk to his office in the Eaton Centre, while she can take her daughter to Mandarinlanguage preschool in Chinatown on foot. Ms. Liau also says that part of the draw are the child-friendly amenities offered in her complex, like a movie theatre for holding birthday parties, a swimming pool that lets her bypass the waiting lists for city recreation programs, and an indoor playground, which was especially appreciated during this past brutal winter.
But the air-drop of new people into already-busy neighbourhoods definitely brings problems. The snarl of traffic in, out and past CityPlace is formidable - cars, bicycles and pedestrians all act independently, regardless of the stop lights - and it's not the only capacity issue the neighbourhood is grappling with. Here, and in neighbourhoods from High Park to Yonge and Sheppard, condo parents are dismayed to learn that their kids might not automatically get into the high-rated schools in their district, because there just isn't room. Two new schools are being built to handle the influx from CityPlace and other Fort York condos, but in the interim, there will be a whole lot of busing.
Ensuring his daughter's smooth transition into a local school is part of why Andrew Geldard is currently renting an apartment in the Junction while waiting for his condo to be built. "That way, if she starts school before it's ready, she'll already be in the right one," said the 37year-old, who bought a 1,000square-foot unit in the Duke condos, a seven-storey apartment and townhouse complex at the corner of Dundas Street West and Indian Grove Avenue. The building is slated to be ready for occupancy at the end of 2015. By that time, Mr. Geldard's daughter will be almost five, and his son will be just over two years old.
Mr. Geldard and his wife spent a few months casually looking for a house before accepting that ground-floor real estate is currently too much for their budget, and anxiety levels. "There's all this frantic panicking that you have to do to win a house," he says of Toronto's current market, which is rife with bidding wars and competition. "We nearly made one bid and pulled out. I felt like a rabbit in the headlights."
As a senior designer with Quadrangle Architects - which is working with the developer TAS on the Duke - Mr. Geldard knew firsthand that the building's floor plans truly maximized the small space. It helps that he grew up in a narrow townhouse in England, though he does wish he had a "garden" for his kids to play in. Part of why he and his wife like the Junction is the proximity to parks: the wading pool at Vine Avenue makes it a favourite. Choosing an apartment as his starter home was a compromise, but it's one he thinks can work for the present time. "A condo seems like the stepping stone to a bigger property in the future," he says.
One major drawback for families considering condos has been the lack of larger units on the market, leading them to command prices comparable to smaller homes (especially once maintenance fees are added in).
Having noticed the demand, some developers are finally responding. Duke developer TAS has just launched a new mid-rise building, Kingston & Co, east of Main Street in the upper Beaches. Toronto's average condo size is 800 square feet - more than half of the units in Kingston & Co are that big or larger, with the biggest ones bordering on 1,600 square feet. Many units have eight-foot-deep terraces, with sizes from 160 to 520 square feet, and most are split into two or three bedrooms. TAS cheif executive and president Mazyar Mortazavi says these design decisions were made purposely to attract families.
"The units have the kind of space you need to keep a vacuum in, so you're not always running to your basement locker," says Mr. Mortazavi. He knows that many people choose condos over houses because of economic constraints, but says the upside of that is the decision to remain in downtown neighbourhoods. The goal is to make Kingston a building that appeals to buyers from singletons to parents to retirees. Rather than a condo, Mr. Mortazavi hopes they'll consider the seven-storey building a "home in a multiuse environment" - one they can stay in as they transition through life stages.
Ms. Liau says that her family will need more square footage at some point, but while her husband is set on a house, she'd consider another condo. "We'll probably move in a year or two," she says, "and I want to stay as central as possible."

Abstract: There have been some reports and statistics about the scale of foreign money in Vancouver real estate before, but few have been conclusive - and none have settled the debate. One Sotheby's report based on a survey of its agents found that 40 per cent of the luxury properties it sold in Vancouver were to foreign buyers - but not all of them were from China.

Full text:   One of the largest real estate companies in British Columbia says that more than one-third of all the single-family detached homes it sold last year went to people with ties to mainland China.
Macdonald Realty Ltd. , which has over 1,000 agents and staff in B.C., said 33.5 per cent of the 531 single family homes sold by its Vancouver offices in 2013 went to people who the company said were a mix of recent immigrants and Canadian citizens.
Those buyers, the company added, tended to spend more money, too, with the average cost of a house sold to these clients topping $2-million, compared to $1.4-million on average overall.
The figures did not include Macdonald's sales in suburban areas such as Richmond, Burnaby or North Vancouver.
"This is our snapshot of Vancouver," says Dan Scarrow, vicepresident of corporate strategy at Macdonald Realty.
The information is based on reports from the firm's sales, anecdotes from its agents and Mr.
Scarrow's own experience working with mainland Chinese clients, and it's a glimpse into the influence of mainland Chinese money on Vancouver's real estate market, which is considered among the most expensive in North America.
Vancouver has been flooded in recent years by tens of thousands of investor-class immigrants from mainland China, who have seen the west coast city as a stable - and picturesque - place to park their capital in luxury property.
That has helped drive up the average price of a single-family home in Vancouver to around $1.2-million.
Mr. Scarrow, who noted the firm does not query buyers about immigration status, believes that investment flowing from mainland China into Vancouver real estate is a quantifiable phenomenon, but has not personally seen much of the more controversial type of buyer: Those from abroad who buy for investment purposes but never live in the city. "We still see very few pure investors from China who have no connection to Vancouver," he says.
Getting a handle on foreign buyers is difficult and Macdonald's survey is far from exact - though one major property developer in Richmond said "that sounds about right." The federal government does not collect meaningful data on the number of foreign buyers purchasing Canadian real estate, leaving industry participants to debate the impact of foreign capital on the local market. And that debate has gotten heated recently, with some developers accusing others of racism and criticizing those who want to slap curbs on foreign investment. The issue is complicated by the fact that some of Vancouver's ethnically Chinese Canadian citizens with ties to Hong Kong view newer immigrants from mainland China with a degree of suspicion, assuming their wealth might have been accumulated in part by proximity to China's Communist Party, rather than in a free market with the rule of law like Hong Kong.
The lack of hard data has also complicated discussions about the city's affordability crisis and fuelled a local cottage industry where analysts attempt to decipher the scope of foreign money by looking at things like electricity usage in downtown neighbourhoods where some suspect foreign buyers have bought condos in which they never live.
"People always say there are no stats. Well, here are the stats," says Mr. Scarrow. "This is actual evidence."
There have been some reports and statistics about the scale of foreign money in Vancouver real estate before, but few have been conclusive - and none have settled the debate. One Sotheby's report based on a survey of its agents found that 40 per cent of the luxury properties it sold in Vancouver were to foreign buyers - but not all of them were from China. Many developers trying to downplay fears about Chinese investment cite a statistic showing that only 1 to 3 per cent of Vancouver real estate purchases are "foreign" buyers - but, as is the case with Macdonald's sales, many more expensive homes are still sold to people based here but who have come, at some point, from mainland China. A 2011 study by Landcor Data showed that 74 per cent of luxury purchases in Richmond and Vancouver's expensive west side were by buyers with mainland Chinese names.
Mr. Scarrow says his company is "indicative of the overall market," since his firm has some real estate agents who target Chinese buyers, but is also firmly oriented toward domestic sales, unlike other real estate firms that deliberately target Chinese buyers.
At the same time, Mr. Scarrow and Macdonald are so bullish on the potential for Chinese investment that he is spearheading the company's efforts to open an office in China. "While there is very little data about foreign investors in Vancouver real estate, our own internal data is enough for us to commit to investing in a representative office in Shanghai," said Mr. Scarrow, whose mother Lynn Hsu, who came from Taiwan in 1979, is the majority owner and president of Macdonald.
Others remain unconvinced - not about whether there is an influx of Chinese money, but whether the flow of foreign capital will continue unabated.
Richard Kurland, a Vancouver immigration lawyer who works with wealthy Chinese immigrants, believes Vancouver may see a slowdown in foreign investment. He said some wealthy Chinese buyers might get anxious and sell off second properties because of the current crackdown on corruption in China.
In meetings with top real estate agents earlier this year, Mr. Kurland predicted that luxury residential real estate could drop in value by as much as 25 per cent as foreign investment dips. As evidence, he points to July real estate figures that showed 106 homes for sale on the west side in the $3-million to $3.5-million price bracket, and just nine sales, compared to 73 active listings and seven sales during July of 2013.

Full text:   This is the first of an occasional series from The Globe's Brian Milner, who visited Japan to assess the results of dramatic efforts to revitalize the world's third-largest economy .
An innovative Japanese retailer that inspires fierce loyalty among customers for its unusual nobrand philosophy and carefully crafted apparel, appliances, stationery, furniture and myriad of other household items is coming to Canada.
Muji, which has expanded rapidly across large swaths of Asia and Europe and recently opened its ninth store in the United States, will launch its first Canadian foray in the heart of downtown Toronto near the Eaton Centre in mid-December. It intends to add two more stores in the city by the end of next year, before spreading to other large urban markets.
With some 3,000 available products (compared with about 7,500 in its Japanese stores), Muji will be doing battle in the hotly competitive local market with everyone from nearby purveyors of branded casual clothing, home and fashion accessories, to the likes of Target, Staples, Shoppers Drug Mart and even Ikea.
But this doesn't faze the Japanese invader, which sticks resolutely to its pitch as an environmentally responsible antidote to overpriced global brands, shoddy discount goods and wasteful packaging. To keep costs down, it steers clear of the highest-priced malls, spends nothing on market research, next to nothing on advertising - less than 2 per cent of sales in Japan and below 1 per cent overseas - and largely ignores the competition.
"We have over 270 shops around the world," Satoru Matsuzaki, the ebullient senior managing director responsible for overseas operations, says in an interview at the company's lowkey headquarters in northeast Tokyo. "We did not do any market research coming into a new country. We don't spend such money. Then, we can achieve reasonable prices."
Like other major Japanese retailers, Muji has focused increasingly on foreign expansion, especially to China and fastergrowing Asian emerging markets, to counter slower sales on the home front. The Japanese launched a similar overseas drive in the 1970s and booming 1980s. But then, the charge was led by higher-end fashion and department stores.
Today, the action is centred in the mass-market end of the business. By 2017, Muji expects to be operating more stores abroad than in slow-growth Japan, where retailers are grappling with fierce competition from foreign and other domestic players, amid reduced spending by an aging, shrinking population and declining work force.
Fast Retailing's Uniqlo apparel chain, Asia's biggest, is also reported to be coming to Canada by 2016 as part of a huge overseas expansion. The company declined an interview request to discuss its plans.
Aeon Group, Japan's largest retailer, which once owned U.S. clothing chain Talbots, has been building its own malls across China and other markets in emerging Asia. Its goal is to reach 1-trillion yen ($10.65-billion) in overseas revenue by fiscal 2016, double the current level and 12.5 per cent of its target for total sales.
But Aeon is steering well clear of the established markets of Europe and North America, where Muji executives see plenty of potential for their array of products featuring consumerfriendly designs, simple materials, plain packaging and reasonable - though not discounted - prices.
In Europe and the U.S., "we were told that there are many simple products on the market. However, there are not many that are both simple and welldesigned," Mr. Matsuzaki says.
Like Aeon, Muji is still expanding in Japan. But foreign sales are growing faster. They accounted for 21.2 per cent of total operating revenue of $2.35-billion in fiscal 2013 and the company is aiming for 30 per cent by 2016.
Muji itself is the retail brand of Ryohin Keikaku Co. Ltd. But you won't find its plain logo on any of the thousands of items on display in its spacious, uncluttered stores. It doesn't even acknowledge the often celebrated designers it has recruited to develop everything from entire houses to made-in-Japan jeans, its best-selling aroma diffusers, ubiquitous travel cases, ball-point pens and notebooks.
"I don't think things have to be branded. It's more that they have to be useful in daily life," Shiori Tajima, 24, a yoga instructor, says as she checks out neat piles of exercise apparel at the softly lit flagship store in Tokyo's Ginza district. "Wearing Muji is different from Ralph Lauren. I only wear [branded] clothes for special occasions."
The name is short for Mujirushi Ryohin (no-brand superior items), which began life in 1980 as the private-label brand of a major supermarket chain. At the time, Japan was starting to feel the effects of the bubble economy that would drive real estate and other asset prices sky high. Consumers, who had long equated discounts with lower quality, used their increased wealth to acquire foreign luxury brands.
"They thought that expensive was good, so the products must be good too," Mr. Matsuzaki says partly in English and partly through an interpreter. As a result, something worth, say, 500 yen was being sold for 10 times that amount "just because of one brand logo. We thought: What if we could provide customers with truly valuable products at a good price?"
Canadians will soon get their first look at the answer.

Full text:   Construction is soon to begin on Vancouver House and the impact - stylistic, economic and cultural - is just beginning to be felt
kgold@globeandmail.com
Construction on Vancouver House will begin in the next four months and as it goes up, so, too, will the city's cachet as one of those places worthy of world-class architecture.
We've all seen the renderings of the tower that appears to twist, and few dispute that Vancouver House is a thing of beauty. It's also going up in a downtown location at Beach and Howe that needed a serious jolt of life, in a tight wedge of space darkened by a bridge off-ramp; a dead zone dominated by traffic and perilous for pedestrians.
Once finished, by 2018, Vancouver House will be the sort of sculptural building that lands in the pages of international architecture and design books. Sales of the 388 units began just three weeks ago, and the tower is already half-sold.
Developer Ian Gillespie believes sales are driven by the fact that the tower is unique, and has the lustre of being a Bjarke Ingels project. Since he hired Mr. Ingels for the job, the young Danish architect's demand has soared. He and Mr. Gillespie already have other projects in the works.
"Every city needs to have some special moments that take your breath away, that say to you, 'Okay, this is something unique. This is something beautiful,' " says Mr. Gillespie, the man behind Westbank Projects Corp. "And you can't have too much of that, because then it's not special. But you do need two or three or four special moments in a mature skyline, and Vancouver lacks that."
The tower appears to defy gravity, a top-heavy shape that ascends from a triangular base. It will be more than 500 feet tall and yet its foundation only 6,000 square feet.
"The total floor plate above is about 13,000 square feet, so your building is twice as heavy up top," says director of sales Jason Dolker. "It's the reverse of the usual building that gets skinnier and skinner as it goes up."
It wasn't a creation driven by ego, or the "edifice complex" that drives development in cities such as Dubai and elsewhere, insists Mr. Gillespie.
"This wasn't some attempt at being extravagant or trying to shock people into some crazy form," he says. "Instead, the form came out of the constraints."
As part of its $4-million amenities contribution, Westbank is building a market-style area under the nearby Granville Street Bridge. The project includes stores, restaurants and office space and 95 market rental apartments.
There's also a public art component, with Rodney Graham's spinning chandelier, located at market level. Over the course of the day, the chandelier will slowly descend and at 9 p.m. spin rapidly, then slowly ascend again.
Mr. Ingels, 39 - who was introduced to Mr. Gillespie by former city planning director Brent Toderian - has been directly involved in the design of the faucets, the copper backsplashes, the kitchen islands that are shaped like the building, an infinity pool, the lobby couch that resembles stacked sand bags, and floating mailboxes designed to encourage conversation between residents.
"There is a strong link between architecture and interiors, like some of the features in the architecture repeat in the interior design," says Bjarke Ingels Group partner Thomas Christoffersen, who met with Mr. Gillespie in Vancouver this week. "We are doing a lot of customized items, such as built-in furniture."
Like most major projects, it hasn't been without its controversy. Eyebrows have been raised about marketing to global purchasers. An influx of foreign money, mostly from China, has helped push Vancouver home prices so high as to make affordability an ongoing issue for a city where the average household income is among the lowest for a major North American metropolis. Locals are tired of competing with offshore money for a share of the real estate pie. It's typical for marketers to target overseas buyers, but for locals, it's a sensitive topic.
Westbank began its official marketing launch with real estate agent events in Vancouver in April. The company, which has offices in Shanghai, Beijing and Hong Kong, then marketed the tower in Asia in June. It also marketed the project in New York, London and Beverly Hills.
When asked what he thinks of the unease with foreign ownership, Mr. Gillespie is forthright.
"I think it is a very provincial attitude," he says. "And Vancouver is one of only four cities in the world where 40 per cent of the population is born outside of Canada. The second thing I would say is that the foreign buyer is buying a unit that creates hundreds of construction jobs. That buyer closes on the unit, and then pays thousands and thousands of dollars a year in property taxes, and doesn't use infrastructure that those property taxes pay for. If that's the worst-case scenario, then maybe we have bigger problems."
Mr. Gillespie says we also need to define the meaning of "foreign owner."
"The majority [of units] will sell to local residents of Vancouver," he says. "And I don't know where the numbers will shake out, but 35 to 40 per cent will sell overseas. And at the end of the day, most of those people already are Canadian citizens.
About 90 per cent of the buyers in Hong Kong already have Canadian citizenship. Is it foreign because they don't carry a passport? What does foreign even mean? In today's world, what do those concepts mean?" As for the potential empty condo issue, Mr. Gillespie says that the number of empty condos typically shrink as the residents settle in. Wealthy global purchasers are often transient.
"These buildings mature and as they mature, the ownership of the units gravitates to people who are owner/occupiers," he says. "I could point out building after building that has been through the same pattern.
Because what happens is, you are a buyer from Singapore, and you buy a unit in Vancouver, and why do you buy that unit? They never, ever buy just on speculation. They don't buy to flip it.
Those days are gone 10 or 20 years ago. Our market doesn't go cyclical up and down. It's a very steady market. They buy because they think it's going to be a second home or because they have a child who will go to UBC, or because they are thinking of leaving Hong Kong because they are worried about air pollution.
And the ones who don't end up coming, it's because their kid who they thought was going to UBC decides to be a rock star.
Instead, they end up renting the unit out.
"But in those years they are paying property taxes, and supporting the City of Vancouver. So in the whole scheme of things in a city that will continue to blossom over the next century, why worry about something like a building not being occupied in next three or four years?"

238 YEARS OF SERVICE. ONE MAJOR SPENDING SCANDAL

Abstract: "I don't know what happens to mayors sometimes in a lot of cities, but they think that after a long period of time, they're like kings or queens. And they don't need to listen," said Paul Palleschi, a 29-year veteran of city council. While he has long been a staunch supporter of the mayor, he said the report proved Ms. [Susan Fennell] was not "lily-white."

Full text:   After a scathing audit revealed years of misspending, Brampton's council has been thrust into the spotlight and its residents are wondering how this happened. Continually re-elected incumbents - some have held their positions for more than two decades - have quashed efforts to bring more accountability to city hall. Disengaged voters are now tuning in, saying it's time to shake things up. Dakshana Bascaramurty reports ahead of an election that could change the face of the city's politics
Brampton has evolved from a sleepy suburb into Canada's ninthlargest municipality, but it seems city hall hasn't yet received the memo.
The faces on the 11-member council haven't changed much in the past two decades, even though the population it represents has soared from about 260,000 to nearly 600,000 in that same period - two-thirds of them visible minorities. Long tenures have made some on council a little too comfortable, and allowed accountability to fall to the wayside.
Deloitte Canada delivered a searing report last week, calling out Brampton City Council - and especially the mayor - for everything from charging $220 in mobile phone IQ tests to a corporate account to purchasing $128,000 of pricey flight passes on the taxpayer's dime. Brampton, one of Canada's fastest-growing and most diverse cities, has now been thrust into the spotlight with a spending scandal by a council that does not reflect its population. Residents who are finally tuning in are asking how this could happen.
The current crop of council members has served a collective 238 years on council - an average of 22 years each. A case of continually re-elected incumbents and a disengaged electorate have created the perfect setting for oversight to fall through the cracks. But the magnitude of the current spending scandal has reached even the most apathetic of voters: They're paying attention, plan to vote and may just overhaul council come election day.
Brampton real estate agent Bachittar Saini said he had voted for Susan Fennell in the past several elections because she was the incumbent. But after learning of her misspending and that of other councillors through the media in the past year, he's become politically active and is trying to encourage his fellow residents to elect a brand new slate of council members.
"I hope they wake up and don't vote for any of these [incumbents]. It's not one guy - the whole council needs to be replaced," he said.
On Oct. 27, Torontonians will head to the polls to elect their mayor in what has been one of the most colourful elections in a while, but just as big a change will be happening next door in Brampton. Political watchers predict voters will show up to polls in higher numbers - beyond the dismal 33 per cent seen in 2010 - eager to shake up what has been status quo for so long.
"Certainly, the mayor is in deep trouble and I imagine many of the councillors will be, too. It's not unheard of in this kind of situation for there to be a kind of tidal wave of throwing out the rascals," said Andrew Sancton, an urban politics professor at Western University in London, Ont. It's the first election when Ms. Fennell will face two serious challengers: former Ontario municipal affairs minister Linda Jeffrey and fellow council member John Sanderson, who is backed by many other councillors.
After completing its $243,000 audit, Deloitte identified the key reason for the many breaches of the city's spending policy by members of council: In 2011, council approved a new expense policy, which eliminated oversight. Previously, the city's finance department approved expense reports, but with one vote, council switched to an honour system - a system that allowed for $172,608 in transactions by the mayor and $46,000 by the rest of council that breached the city's expense policies to go unchecked. The audit report has now been passed along to Peel Regional Police, who may investigate whether the mayor and councillors broke the law.
"I don't know what happens to mayors sometimes in a lot of cities, but they think that after a long period of time, they're like kings or queens. And they don't need to listen," said Paul Palleschi, a 29-year veteran of city council. While he has long been a staunch supporter of the mayor, he said the report proved Ms. Fennell was not "lily-white."
Mr. Palleschi was found to not be "lily-white" either - auditors said he breached city finance rules, too. What's more, he voted in favour of the new expense policy in 2011 because, he says, he thought councillors were mature enough to handle an honour system.
Other mechanisms of accountability have also crumbled, or just never came to fruition, in the city.
In 2007, Mr. Sancton was appointed as Brampton's closed meetings investigator. By law, members of municipal councils cannot meet to discuss city business outside of open, public meetings (with a few exceptions).
Mr. Sancton, who quit his post earlier this year, said he had not received a single complaint during his seven-year tenure. That may have been because the City of Brampton charges residents $250 to make a complaint.
"I think it probably did have a chilling effect," Mr. Sancton says.
In what initially seemed a promising move on the accountability front, Brampton retained mediator Donald Cameron to serve as its integrity commissioner in 2011. Mr. Cameron investigated and filed a report on Ms.
Fennell, clearing her of accusations she had acted improperly when raising money for a private fundraising gala. Unhappy with that and other rulings, councillors voted to fire the integrity commissioner this past spring. A few months later, they hired a new commissioner, who is currently investigating the findings of Deloitte's audit report.
Ontario Ombudsman André Marin says council should not be able to meddle with these offices, which are there to keep them in check.
"You don't hire or fire. You don't suspend. You hire these people on terms. A five-year term is ideal. And you don't interfere - you let them run the show," he said.
The flaws in the city's government aren't limited to lack of accountability, though. As those who cover politics for ethnic media see it, the city is stuck in another era because, while 66 per cent of Brampton's population are visible minorities, only one member of council is not white.
Incumbents tend to clinch victory term after term, based on their name recognition, says Asma Amanat, a political reporter with South Asian Generation Next, a publication based in Peel Region.
"They have been there forever. They don't even come out in the community," Ms. Amanat says. She saw a bump in councillors attending events following the 2010 election, but believes they were there to win back favour, not actually engage with the community. For Ms. Fennell in particular, Ms. Amanat says she's won over much of Brampton's South Asian community by being a regular fixture at community events.
But at least three new faces will be on council this fall, as two councillors have announced their retirement and another, Mr. Sanderson, is not seeking re-election because he is running for mayor. Manan Gupta, who is running in one of those races, hopes to change that ratio, though establishing name recognition has been a challenge.
"There's no party machine, you know?" he says. "In municipal elections, there is nothing like that. So you are totally dependent upon your own independent credibility, your outreach, your passion."
Yudhvir Jaswal, the editor of South Asian Daily, which is distributed throughout the GTA, and host of several radio and TV programs, says there has been a lack of representation of South Asians on council because little importance is given to local politics in India and that mentality is imported to Canada when immigrants arrive here.
"Municipal-level politics - it's not discussed in the media, it's not discussed in the community that much," he says.
Vicky Dhillon, the lone South Asian on council, was defeated in two municipal elections before he was elected in 2006. When he went door-knocking to meet residents, they'd ask what post he was running for: MP? MPP? "I'm not running for MP or MPP," he told them. "I'm running for panchyat member" - the equivalent of a city councillor in Punjab state, India, where many of Brampton's South Asian residents are from. He would then have to explain what issues local government handled and why they should care to vote.
This campaign won't just be about property taxes or new recreation facilities, Mr. Jaswal predicts - the expense scandal has been widely discussed in the ethnic press.
"This time, the race will be really tough," Mr. Jaswal said. "I think, primarily, the voters are a lot more engaged now."

Full text:   Tool sheds were bulldozed and plants uprooted on Thursday as CP Rail followed through on its intent to reclaim its property along the Arbutus corridor.
City residents who tended plots in community gardens along the strip were dismayed, with some calling the clearing a bullying tactic by CP, which has long wanted to sell or develop the land.
"I feel sick," Paul Kendal, who has gardened in a community plot along the line for the past four years.
"They [CP] have no actual intent of running trains [along this track] - this is all about trying to get money from the city," Mr. Kendal said. "People sink a lot into this - and the fact that they are destroying this as part of a negotiation when the city is actually talking to them about giving them millions of dollars - it makes me sick to my stomach."
The company wrote to area residents in May to say negotiations to dispose of the property had stalled and that it would look for ways to optimize use of the corridor, including running trains on it.
A subsequent notice set a deadline of July 31 for removing encroachments, including gardens, furniture and buildings, from the property.
"CP is doing what it said it would do: complete the necessary work, which includes the safe removal of vegetation and obstructions, to begin to get the track and infrastructure in the area up to federal operating standards," CP spokeswoman Breanne Feigel said on Thursday in an e-mail. "We approached the work today carefully and were respectful to our neighbours along this corridor."
Ms. Feigel said clearing work would continue into next week.
Mayor Gregor Robertson responded with dismay to word that CP was clearing the land.
"It's very disappointing, given there is no business case for reactivating cargo trains. We've asked CP to respect the wishes of the local neighbourhood, and to continue to work with the city towards a long-term solution," he said in a statement.
The 11-kilometre Arbutus corridor runs from False Creek to the Fraser River through some of the priciest real estate in the city.
The property has been in limbo since at least 2000, when the city passed a bylaw designating the corridor a public thoroughfare.
CP challenged the bylaw in court. The case went to the Supreme Court of Canada, which in 2006 ruled in favour of the city, saying it controls land use along the route and did not have to pay compensation to CP for the bylaw's effect, which CP said amounted to freezing the corridor without legally acquiring it.
The track was last used for trains in 2001.
The city and CP have since held off-and-on discussions about the corridor. In the most recent round, the parties have been far apart on price, with the city believed to be offering $20million while CP is said to want $100-million.
In a July letter to CP chief executive Hunter Harrison, Mr. Robertson said, "we disagree with you on what fair market value is for the land," noting that the city's assumptions are based on existing and future allowed uses for property under Vancouver's official development plan, while CP's assumptions hinge on potential value if development was allowed.
In the letter, the mayor also asked CP to cease efforts to remove community gardens, saying "over the last 14 years, there have been no trains, minimal upkeep and little to no interest in this greenway from CP."
The city has not received a response to that letter.

Full text:   It's not perfect, but critics have been too harsh on the still-developing condo neighbourhood
daveleblanc@globeandmail.com
'What do you think of Liberty Village?" The question was simple enough, but coming from Mark Wigmore, a good friend who enjoys good conversation over good wine, it was a loaded one.
The problem was, I didn't have an answer. While I'd popped into the area from time-to-time over the past few years, these were "surgical strikes" rather than strolls-with-a-critical-eye.
I told him, however, that the area had received a lot of criticism from other architectural thinkers as density has increased; in 2008, the Star's Christopher Hume wrote that "Liberty Village illustrates everything that's wrong with planning in Toronto" and specifically aimed his hate-ray at the "strip mall" containing the Metro grocery store.
In 2013, Mr. Hume concluded that a place "that once held so much promise" was now just "an over-developed condo enclave."
Derek Flak, writing in BlogTO, stated that the area lacked "the historical identity of ... the Distillery District," and just a few months ago, Toronto Life complained about Liberty Village's dog poop problem because of a lack of green space.
So, with that in mind, I promised my pal I'd follow the same route he took - enter at the new East Liberty Street where it meets Strachan Avenue, and walk to Dufferin - and get back to him.
Entering at Strachan is currently a bit of a letdown. One corner greets visitors with a massive pile of dirt, and the other with a fenced-off, weedy field. Both looked exactly the same on a Google Map photo from May, 2013.
However, past the condo marketing sandwich boards, past the "Open House Meets Speed Dating" lawn sign, things improve with Gateway Park, where folks are stooping and scooping on the little walkways. To the north, facing the park, are three-storey townhouses; west along East Liberty and similar townhouses meet the street. While I'm no fan of the faux-historicist detailing, their scale, landscaping and siting reminds me of some areas of the much-lauded St. Lawrence Neighbourhood. On the south side, developers of the new, black-brick condo tower have likewise added townhouses to achieve similar results.
Just past the townhouses, as I crossed Pirandello Street (formerly Lower Shaw), I spied the lovely ruins of the Central Prison for Men's Roman Catholic Chapel (1877), which also enjoyed life as an army base, immigrant processing centre and, finally, as part of the enormous John Inglis and Sons complex that once dominated here. While the new Liberty Village Park around the chapel is complete, reports in 2011 stating that a Miller Tavern would occupy the building "within a year" have, sadly, proven false. However, 2011 did see the addition of Perpetual Motion by Chilean sculptor Francisco Gazitua to the west of the chapel; while I enjoy Mr. Gazitua's work - many of his pieces, including a bridge, populate the CityPlace neighbourhood - I'd rather see commissions go to local sculptors who better know the area's history.
Speaking of which, Swissborn, New York-based artist Olaf Breuning's Guardians took up residence in front of 85 East Liberty St. this past October. And while 65, 75 and 85 East Liberty St. may not win architectural awards for their innovation (the large, gridded windows are a nice touch), these striking figures - inspired by Easter Island moais - are a welcome addition.
After noting that CanAlfa's new condo at No. 150 is one of the few to incorporate red brick into its design (octogenarian architect Jerome Markson once reminded me that "Toronto is a red brick city"), I was drawn toward more red brick, this time in the form of an old boiler house at No. 165 (now a pub), and beside it, an inviting covered walkway that follows the path of old railway tracks between a former munitions factory and another building at No. 171 (both housing retail).
While I love the smaller scale of these buildings and how they contrast with their tall smokestack, the city recently approved partial demolition and re-development with added height and density (as neither is on the city's heritage inventory). Sigh.
To the north on Snooker Street sits the "strip mall" with the grocery store. While a walk past was not on my agenda since it didn't match my friend's walk, I will admit here that it doesn't bother me: It serves a purpose, it's tucked away from the high street and it's walkable for the entire community.
The old Irwin Toy building at Hanna Avenue was next. While I outlined the complex renovation by Quadrangle in a March, 2008, column, I still get a kick out of seeing this gem, and how packed the coffee shop is; here, also, is where East Liberty changes to Liberty, narrows, and a feast of heritage buildings await.
Past the Brunswick Balke Collender Co. building (1890) to Atlantic Avenue, I cheated and jogged north to take in the curved pediment and chocolatebrown brick of the Bank of Commerce Book Vaults building (1912). After Lamport Stadium, it was onto the delights of "The Castle" at No. 135 Liberty (home of E.W. Gillette in 1912) and the massive Toronto Carpet Factory complex (1899 - 1920). While there are less people and activity here on weekends, it's humming on weekdays.
So what will I tell Mr. Wigmore? Like him, I was impressed. While it's certainly no Distillery District - Toronto's version of touristy Old Montreal - enough heritage remains that it's anything but another condo enclave.
Some sections are overdeveloped, but others leave room to breathe and take in one's surroundings, and often those are beat-up, industrial and oozing heritage.
The repetitive nature of some condos doesn't offend, but rather keeps the focus on street-level activity; besides, if every new building were a sculptural oneoff, Liberty Village would be a pretty bizarre place. The green space problem is no worse than other downtown neighbourhoods, and the amount of hardscaped areas such as piazzas and widened sidewalks is increasing. Take a walk and see for yourself.

Full text:   Ron Giesbricht received $800,000 bonus from land deal, while the rest of the band's 82 members each were sent $10,000 cheques
Opposition to a B.C. chief who was paid almost $1-million last year has virtually dried up, says a band member who had been publicly demanding Ron Giesbrecht's resignation.
In the days after Mr. Giesbrecht announced his refusal to step down last Friday, members of the small First Nation in suburban Vancouver have learned more about the deal that earned the chief his record pay. In exchange for surrendering the band's right to a lucrative piece of property on Burke Mountain, the chief collected 10 per cent of an $8-million deal and sent $10,000 cheques to each of the band's 82 members from the rest of the money.
Ron Jackman, who has led the call for Mr. Giesbrecht to step down, questions whether his fellow Kwikwetlem First Nation members knew what their chief was signing away to the province.
"Along with the $10,000 cheque we got a statement last June telling us that a deal was finalized on Burke Mountain. We never heard the word 'extinguish,' we never heard the word 'abandon,' it was only called a deal," Mr. Jackman said.
"Now we know our chief extinguished our rights to that land."
The chief earned $914,219 in 2013, according to financial information recently disclosed under the First Nations Financial Transparency Act. Most of that came from his $800,000 bonus on the deal, which was received as part of his role as the community's economic development officer.
While the band and B.C. government have refused to provide specifics on the deal, the Ministry of Finance has confirmed that an "extinguishment of future claims" was at the centre of the $8-million agreement.
The process of abandoning a band's title and right to a piece of land, known as extinguishment, is a controversial practice in B.C. While modern treaties have required limited extinguishment as part of land swaps, many chiefs refuse to discuss a surrender of land.
"We don't support the notion of extinguishment. We believe that our indigenous land rights are inherent; they are part of who we are," said Grand Chief Stewart Phillip, president of the Union of B.C. Indian Chiefs.
"Along with that right goes a responsibility of being a caretaker for the land."
Mr. Phillip did not want to comment on the situation in Kwikwetlem.
Mr. Jackman, a 39-year-old student at the B.C. Institute of Technology, said Wednesday a petition to oust the chief was suspended.
"We just didn't have the votes."
While the band administration had helped Mr. Jackman in the past, he said he's been barred from the band offices since he started asking questions about the extinguishment.
About 15 kilometres north of the First Nation, the wooded slope of Burke Mountain is at the northeast corner of neighbouring Coquitlam. The Vancouver suburb's current urban plan calls for extensive building on the mountain over the next three decades, envisioning that 30,000 people will live in the area by the century's midpoint.
"It's the last developable tract of land in the Lower Mainland; if you want a new home you'll come to Burke," said local real estate agent Rebecca Permack.
Homes at the bottom of the mountain already sell for about $1-million.
The sale of 584 acres of public land on Burke Mountain was confirmed in the province's 2014 budget.
More than half of it was sold to local developers. It's unclear how many of those acres were claimed by the Kwikwetlem band and could have been covered as part of the $8-million deal.
Mr. Phillip says he visited the community in the past year and described the local leaders as "humble" and dismissed some of the heated non-First Nations reaction as a "race-based witch hunt."
"They aren't the high rollers they've been made out to be," he said.
Calls to the band for comment weren't returned. In the past, the band has said that it couldn't comment on the deal due to a non-disclosure agreement required by the province. B.C. officials have said they would release information on the deal with the First Nation's consent.

Full text:   July homes sales numbers to confirm whether there is true momentum behind the market across Canada
The Canadian Real Estate Association is set to release existing homes sales data for July on Friday and economists will be watching closely to see whether the momentum the market has shown in recent months will persist.
Opinions are mixed about whether the recent sales growth stems mostly from buyers who hibernated during the exceptionally cold weather earlier in the year, or whether it is sustainable.
More homes changed hands over the Multiple Listing Service during June than in any other month over the prior four years, pulled up by activity in Calgary, Vancouver, Toronto and Hamilton.
While the national numbers for July won't be out until the end of the week, data from local real estate boards have already been released in various parts of the country, and sales don't appear to have levelled off. They are up 2 per cent in Montreal year over year, 9.7 per cent in Edmonton, 3.9 per cent in Vancouver, 3.18 per cent in Calgary, and 10 per cent in Toronto.
One interesting note is that condo sales are outpacing detached home sales in a number of cities, including Montreal, Calgary and Edmonton, a phenomenon that industry experts say stems largely from rising home prices. Condo sales rose 13 per cent in Montreal, while sales of single-family homes fell by 4 per cent. In Calgary, condo sales rose by 21 per cent, while sales of single-family homes fell by 1.3 per cent.
While sales are rising, prices have retreated recently on a month-to-month basis. Market observers have been watching and waiting for the average selling price of a detached home in downtown Toronto to hit the $1-million mark, but the average selling price of a detached home in the City of Toronto was $880,433 in July, down from $921,127 in June, $943,055 in May, $965,670 in April and $898,332 in March.
The average national price will likely be pulled up again by sales in Calgary, Toronto and Vancouver. The average selling price of a home in the city of Calgary rose 4.9 per cent from a year earlier, to $482,487. The average price of all types of homes in the Toronto area rose 7.5 per cent to $550,700. Vancouver's prices have rebounded in the wake of a slowdown.

Full text:   Victoria is known for its many popular attractions: the photogenic Inner Harbour, the Robert Bateman Centre, the Royal British Columbia Museum, the famed Empress Hotel, the restaurants and shopping.
But as lovely as it is, Victoria residents don't spend every Sunday afternoon having tea at the Empress. They're too busy living up to their title as Canada's fittest city, exploring the spectacular natural setting - and the great food and drink - in their backyard.
Navigating B.C.'s capital by pedal, foot or paddle is not only the fit way to go, it's also the best way to get a taste of local life, and to discover less-touristy neighbourhoods. After hitting the downtown must-sees, I did just that and, even as a former resident, I found pockets of the city I hadn't seen before.
Ready for your own DIY adventure triathlon? The three "stages" can be spread across your visit or, if you're feeling energetic, done in a single day.
Stage 1: Ride a bike
Victoria is a cyclist's friend: 11 per cent of residents bike to work, and 4 per cent of all trips in the city are made on two wheels, thanks in part to its year-round mild climate (with much less rain than Vancouver). Visiting cyclists may be surprised by the respectful, well-mannered way in which cars and bicycles share the roads.
To join the fun, stop in at the Pedaler, whose main outlet is one block east of the Inner Harbour. If you're feeling independent, simply rent a bike. All rentals come with a map, lock, helmet (mandatory in B.C.) and tips on where to go. Or take a guided half-day or full-day tour, with themes including coffee, beer, spirits, historical landmarks and family-friendly sights.
I tried the food-oriented, fourhour "Eat, drink, pedal" tour, an eight-kilometre loop that took us into the Fernwood neighbourhood and back via downtown.
Food samples were generous, including delights such as pizza from Zambri's, small-batch ice cream sandwiches from Cold Comfort (try the cherry-rosemary ice cream between thin sheets of dacquoise), and a flight of Vancouver Island beer and cider from a downtown pub, The Guild.
Stage 2: Take a hike
Victoria is a prime spot for runners, and I spent an enjoyable sunny morning jogging along the oceanfront trail on Dallas Road, ending up on a quiet, rocky beach reached via a steep staircase.
But if you want to really stop and enjoy the roses - and the galleries and tea shops - a walk is the way to go. So I donned sunglasses and Birkenstocks and headed for an exploratory hike from downtown to the southeastern community of Oak Bay, via Cook Street Village and Fairfield, two popular neighbourhoods.
My route took me through Beacon Hill Park, home to a native Garry oak meadow and a petting zoo complete with adorable baby pygmy goats, to afternoon tea at the gorgeous Abkhazi Garden - a one-acre, formerly private property that's now protected from development by a local land trust (and feels like a secret garden) - and along Beach Drive, where you'll find some of the city's prime real estate and the stunning oceanside Victoria Golf Club.
The highlight was a visit to hilltop Walbran Park. Although it's accessible by car via Denison Road, the best way to get there is to take the narrow staircase from King George Terrace, around the corner from Sunny Lane (it's easy to miss, so look for the sign).
Climb the steep steps, cross the road, then clamber up on the rocks to get to the lookout tower.
This is the highest point on this part of the coast, offering 360degree views of the city, the Sooke hills in the distance and, across the border, Washington's Olympic Mountains.
Stage 3: Explore by kayak
I learned to kayak during a short stint as a member of the University of Victoria's kayaking club, during which I learned that white water isn't my drink of choice; I'm much happier paddling when flipping is only a remote possibility, not a sure thing. Happily, that's the case with tours by Ocean River Adventures, which also offers rentals of kayaks, canoes, standup paddle boards and related gear.
While tour options include downtown and the Inner Harbour, I continued my neighbourhood theme with a sunset paddle in the Oak Bay Islands Ecological Reserve. Trips depart from the Oak Bay Beach Hotel, where I met my guide, Lee. We headed out on the water from the dock in search of scenic views and wildlife.
It was a beautiful summer Saturday evening and aside from a couple of canoeists looking for a good fishing spot, and a single yacht, we had the bay to ourselves. Paddling through unusually calm water (low winds, helpful tides) under a clear sky, we were able to see Washington's Mount Baker in the distance, more than 100 km away.
We pushed through a field of cable-like bull kelp, ripping off a frond for a taste, circled tiny islands dotted with sea birds and got close to a pack of curious harbour seals who kept popping up nearby. As the sun fell and the sky turned pink, we turned toward shore and I paused to breathe deeply and take it all in. "This is why I live here," Lee, an Ontario native, said with a big smile. "Why would I want to be anywhere else?" .

Full text:   An entrepreneur and an urban guru want to make the GTA home to 'living labs' for the latest in city-building
About a year ago, Alexander Kotyck began casting around for a project that would "make a positive impact" on Toronto, a city he sees struggling with falling productivity and political feuding.
The IT consultant hit on an answer: to position the city as a laboratory for inventing the future.
His goal is to help Toronto create "living labs," purpose-built communities fitted out with the latest innovations in city-building - everything from advanced vehicle sharing schemes to vertical hydroponic farms for eco-friendly food production.
Mr. Kotyck partnered up with Kent Larson, an architect and prominent urban guru who runs the City Science Initiative at MIT's Media Lab. Mr. Larson is a TED Talks star whose work blends the physical design of cities with the mapping of data. His vision builds on the economic development opportunities provided by new technology, and the economic benefits of living in compact, mixed-use neighbourhoods - which are fertile ground for creativity and innovation.
In recent years, he's been looking for cities and corporate partners. Captivated by the ideas and the possibility of a new sort of urban development business venture built around technology, Mr. Kotyck contacted Mr. Larson and asked him to put Toronto on his short list. Mr. Larson obliged and unveiled his ideas to a well-connected crowd earlier this week.
"I saw a blue ocean opportunity to deploy R & D and science focusing on cities," says Mr. Kotyck, who has set up a company, BridgeRock Inc., to attract government, philanthropic and, eventually, venture capital funding.
"There's been some investment in this space by companies like Cisco, but no one's tying it all together."
Mr. Kotyck emphasizes the scheme is at a very preliminary stage, and he hasn't identified a potential location. But he's been talking to Metrolinx, which has been working on planning visions for a series of "mobility hubs" around the Greater Toronto and Hamilton area. Several senior Metrolinx officials attended the event.
City-related technology is an extremely hot field these days, and multinationals such as IBM, Siemens and BMW are racing to develop and sell products and services, such as high-tech traffic management computer systems.
Waterfront Toronto is installing high-speed digital networks in its new development projects, and also building an "innovation centre" that will house tech startups that will test drive new digital services with the area's residents.
Medialab is working in Hamburg, Germany, with a site slated for land on the city's docklands.
Mr. Larson has also attracted corporate backers, including IKEA and a Chinese auto maker, keen to test new technologies with the residents of these urban petri dishes.
Academic groups, such as MIT's City Sciences lab and New York University's Centre for Urban Science and Progress, have been looking to capture huge quantities of urban-related data - e.g., cellphone signals or tweets - in order to solve age-old problems, such as improving transit. The University of Toronto has also assembled vast tranches of urban data that can be used to guide development policy and create digital visualization tools meant to help decision-makers.
Mr. Larson is the latest in a long line of visionaries drawn to the problem of city living. In the late 19th century, Ebenezer Howard laid out a vision for "garden cities" designed to distance families from the noise and stench of factories. In the next generation, modernists such as the Swiss architect Le Corbusier sketched modern cities dominated by soaring apartment towers that would replace crowded, noisy neighbourhoods.
The current visionaries focus on the economic possibilities of new technology, as well as the benefits to be had from living in compact, mixed-use neighbourhoods that appear to be fertile ground for creativity and innovation.
In some cases, the future appears to have arrived, in the guise of mobile technologies such as Uber, the ride-sharing app that is rapidly emerging as an alternative transportation system for anyone with a smartphone.
During his presentation this week, Mr. Larson talked about emerging mobility ideas, such as shared cargo bikes that could be used by individuals during the day and small deliveries at night.
"You have the right mode at the right time for the right trip."
He also showed schematics of "transformable city home" apartments - tiny units with walls and fold-down furniture that can be moved with the press of a button so the occupant could reconfigure the space depending on their needs. IKEA is working with the Media Lab on the furnishings.
Some of Mr. Larson's ideas met with skepticism. Former mayor Barbara Hall, who attended, asked him pointedly whether "equity" considerations factored into his vision of innovation-driven communities.
Mr. Kotyck insists he's soaking up feedback right now, and adds that he's not wedded to a particular plan just yet. He's invited another MIT city sciences expert to visit next month, and is continuing to talk to local government agencies. But he is also actively looking for investors - and presumably some real estate - for a project that will not just test-drive MIT's urban innovations, but eventually sell those technologies to other cities around the world for a profit.
"Research is not enough unless an entrepreneur or enterprise is there to commercialize it," he says. "The objective is to create an ecosystem of organizations that will see things through to the end to ensure that citizens reap the rewards."

Full text:   The city's already beleaguered park board, embroiled in debates over whales, a homeless camp and a tussle over the management of its community centres, now has two other eruptions on its hands.
A dispute between two groups of people, each claiming to be the board of directors for the Riley Park Hillcrest community centre association, has forced the board to take over paying the centre's program instructors while the two fight it out in court this week.
And many people who use Vancouver's popular Aquatic Centre in the West End have been startled to learn that the city's real estate division is floating the idea of having a developer replace the massive facility as its community-amenity contribution for new condo projects around the Granville Bridge.
That has park-board commissioners trying to catch up on both issues and figure out what's next.
Vision Vancouver's Aaron Jasper and the Non-Partisan Association's John Coupar say they are in wait-and-see mode on both, although with some differences.
Mr. Jasper said the battle between the two groups at the Riley Park centre is proof the current system of having volunteer associations co-manage community centres with the park board needs some updating.
"Most of the time, we have high-functioning boards whose hearts and minds are in the right place," Mr. Jasper said. "But it is open to these kinds of problems.
We need some better checks and balances."
Mr. Coupar, on the other hand, thinks the Riley Park fight is an anomaly, and once it is settled will never occur again, so reform is not necessary.
The battle started at Riley Park in 2011, when a new group of directors, several of them from outside the neighbourhood and affiliated with the NPA, was elected after the new community centre was completed as part of the Winter Olympic Games.
Jesse Johl, who was named the association's president at that time, became a vocal opponent of the park board's plan to change its agreement with the volunteer boards on how to distribute money and manage the centres. He and five other community centre associations sued the park board over the plan.
In June, a group of Riley Park members decided to stage a coup, holding an emergency meeting and electing a new set of directors. They complained the association got involved in the lawsuit against the park board without their agreement, and that it was not providing any financial information to members.
The bank that holds the association's considerable reserves has frozen them until a decision is made on which group is the real community-association board.
As a result, the park board has had to step in and pay the 30 program instructors who usually get their cheques from the association.
As well, Mr. Johl and some of the previous board directors are suing members of the new board, saying they were improperly elected. The two sides spent Thursday in court trying to get a ruling on whether a new AGM should be held and who controls the bank account.
"It's a really difficult position," said Marion Waterston, chair of the recently elected board. "I've never been sued before."
Meanwhile, in another part of town, many residents were surprised to hear the city is inviting developers not just to bid on a piece of municipal land under one of the Granville loops - the circular off-ramps of the Granville Bridge - but also potentially to build a new aquatic centre as part of the development.
The offer has been advertised in local newspapers, but Glen Chernen, who has started a new political party and plans to run for mayor, has accused city staff of secretly planning a vast new development with no public consultation.
Although the city has had a plan in place since 2010 to remove the Granville Loops and sell land it owns under them, even Mr. Jasper and Mr. Coupar said they did not know the city was seeking offers until they heard about it in news stories.
They, along with the city's general manager of planning, Brian Jackson, said the bid process is just a test to see if anyone is interested in developing the $36million parcel of land and what kinds of community facilities they might be willing to provide.
And they say the park board could gain, in the end.
"There may be a win-win" if the current aquatic centre can eventually be demolished, Mr. Coupar said. "We could return that to green space."

Exhibit extols Niagara's Motel Modernism

Full text:   1960s Car Culture curiosities are the subject of a nostalgic housing show
daveleblanc@globeandmail.com
Oh, how I love motels. From their mom-and-pop wholesomeness, homey touches, steamy ice machines and sanitized "seat belts" on toilets, all the way to rising above the constraints of their utilitarian plans with paint schemes and silly, mini-Vegas signage, there are so many layers to my love it's hard to make sense of it all.
Yes, there is a little nostalgia involved. Growing up in the 1970s, my working-class family - when not travelling to New Brunswick to catch up with the LeBlanc clan and bunking in their basements - chose short car trips to places such as Wasaga Beach, Parry Sound or Niagara Falls.
Those jaunts, of course, included a motel stay, and from the instant my parents took hold of that plastic key-fob, we kiddies knew the rules would be a little different: We'd be allowed to stay up later, count ice cream and cotton candy as part of the Canada Food Guide, and wardrobes would consist of flip-flops, souvenir T-shirts and dirty fingernails.
However, as I grew older and started to think critically about architecture, my love of the motor-hotel never went away.
But how, I wondered, could an L-shaped building with little more than a buzzing neon sign and a different colour on its doors (to distinguish it from the others) continue to enthrall the intellectual part of my brain as well as the romantic?
Perhaps it's because these humble structures tell us about what we once valued.
Niagara Falls History Museum curator Suzanne Moase agrees.
On until Sept. 7, 2014, '[No] Vacancy, Honeymoon Suite or By-the-Week: Motel Culture in Niagara' wears a warm cloak of nostalgia to lure patrons, but sheds that layer as one explores deeper.
"The exhibition treats the topic of motel culture as an important part of Niagara's past and leaves the visitor thinking not only about its heyday but also about the decline of motels today," she offers. "I am hopeful that by highlighting the gap that lies between the motels of today and ones that once thrived here that we have sparked a conversation about their future preservation or revitalization."
The museum, it should be noted, is on Ferry Street, not far from the still-thriving motels situated a short walk to the tacky tourist traps of Clifton Hill and the natural majesty of that big water-feature (I recommend Kings Inn Near the Falls); by the time the street changes name to Lundy's Lane a few blocks to the west and walking distances increase, one can actually view, in real time, motel seediness increase also. By the time one reaches Lola's Real Good Eats for breakfast (also highly recommended, as is the Flying Saucer Restaurant), the five kilometres between it and the Falls means motels no longer count on happy nuclear families to fill their rooms; much like Scarborough's Kingston Road strip, these are populated by the disenfranchised and disadvantaged.
But back to happier thoughts.
[No] Vacancy greets visitors with a mock reception desk (circa late-60s) complete with vintage brochures and a cigarette lighter, mustard-coloured chairs on a checkerboard floor, and an oscillating fan near the key-fob rack.
Because this section of the exhibit welcomes interaction, kids can get right behind the desk and take fake reservations on the "old fashioned" telephone or thumb through the pop-up address book (and many were doing exactly that the day I visited). Patrons next move to an area where they can try on poodle skirts or letterman sweaters while gazing at grainy blow-ups of charming old postcards.
"A participatory approach was always our goal," Ms. Moase says.
Thoroughly warmed up, it's on to contemplation of a full suite with a vibrating bed (sadly not participatory!), desk, luggage, whipstitch-shaded lamps and tropical wallpaper. The room, assembled by local artist group Brainkite Co., is punctuated by two stands sporting lovely vintage dresses in appropriate hues of pink and turquoise to remind those born after 1980 that people actually used to dress for dinner or a show.
After peering into cases containing various artifacts, gallerygoers are treated to photography by Toronto-based Oliver Pauk and Zach Slootsky. Counterpoint to the idealized blow-ups, these images document area motels in various states of decline. While some still wear jaunty colour schemes, cracked, weedy asphalt tells of an uncertain future, while others, sadly, have slipped into a state of permanent vacancy.
Along the way, humour is injected via a series of "Honeymoon Letters" pasted to gallery walls. Highlights include the 1961 couple that "forgot" to see the Falls and had to turn the car around as they were leaving, the 1953 lady who thought her room was the "height of luxury" and the 1962 honeymooners who opted for the room with two single beds because that configuration came with a television set.
While the age of massive motel clusters like those in Niagara Falls may be dead, the motel itself is not. As long as folks want to stay somewhere closer to the ground, hobnob with the owners, pay a bit less, and allow their kids to spazz out just a little, the motel will continue to survive.
And if nostalgia plays into it, so be it: Get your rose-coloured sunglasses on and meet me by the pool.
Admission to the Niagara Falls History Museum is $5, visit niagarafallsmuseums.ca for more information.

Full text:   Lavish appointments help Swansea house go for over asking
ASKING PRICE $1,695,000
SELLING PRICE $1,750,000
PREVIOUS SELLING PRICES $1,600,000 (2010); $1,075,000 (2005)
TAXES $10,288 (2013)
DAYS ON THE MARKET 18
CO-OP AGENT Nutan Brown, Royal LePage West Realty Group Ltd.
The Action : Clients of agent Nutan Brown were very specific about wanting to move back to a grand estate in their old west-end neighbourhood. This renovated Swansea residence was the first - and only - property they toured after the price was reduced to under $1.7-million, but they were happy to bulk up their offer to beat out a rival buyer.
What They Got : About a decade ago, a local builder designed this 2,730-square-foot residence with lavish appointments, and a previous owner groomed the 21by-141-foot, pie-shaped grounds with stone patios, terraced gardens, in-ground lighting and irrigation systems.
Inside, there is a fireside living room, dining area and combined family room and eat-in kitchen with one of four gas fireplaces, tumbled-marble finishes, custom bar and island and stainless-steel appliances, including a wine cooler and Viking gas stove, as well as access to a deck.
To retire for the day, there is a guest bedroom off a fireside recreation room in the 1,350square-foot basement and four upper bedrooms with pot lights and hardwood floors, including a fireside master suite with a balcony, walk-in closet and the largest of four bathrooms.
The Agent's Take : "It's a great street and great neighbourhood," says agent Nutan Brown.
"And [the buyers] are loving the fact they're within five minutes to Bloor, shops, restaurants and subway. They're really minimizing their carbon footprint by being there."
The buyers were also thrilled there was no work to do inside or out. "The builder is a local westend builder who does very upscale and high-end finishes," Ms. Brown notes.
"Although it looks discreet and not ostentatious from the street, it opens up quite wide at the back and the previous owner had done a magnificent job of landscaping ... it had a lot of stone work, exquisite planting and a beautiful water feature."

Full text:   Architect Steven Fong takes classical Modernism on a forest romp
jmays@globeandmail.com
You're a Toronto couple with a yen to get out of the city in the summer, not much cash, and an acre of virgin Canadian Shield at your disposal.
Though your limited budget makes prefab an attractive housing option for the site, you want something more artistically satisfying than standardized, factorybuilt digs. So you hire an architect, who (if he or she is any good) will engage you in a wideranging dialogue about both practical matters and possible aesthetic strategies before making the first sketch.
The design that comes out of this exchange may describe a traditional northern cottage, with a massive granite fireplace, screened porch, pitched roof and overhanging eaves. There is nothing wrong with such styling, which has a venerable history in Ontario's rocky landscape.
If the designer you've picked is Toronto architect Steven Fong, however, the conversation (and the resulting scheme) probably won't stay within the bounds of the usual.
Mr. Fong started out to be an artist, and his early appreciation for the open-handed, uncomplicated manoeuvres of Minimal and Conceptual sculpture has never dimmed. For an instance of how this interest can translate into the stuff of the building art, take a look at the thousand-square-foot cottage Mr. Fong has done for a Junction couple who had an acre in Ontario's ruggedly picturesque French River district, near Sudbury.
The architect has called his building "a hillbilly Farnsworth House." He thinks of his work as a response to the famous glass and steel wilderness retreat that Ludwig Mies van der Rohe fashioned for Edith Farnsworth, a Chicago doctor. Like that formal masterpiece, the French River bunky is geometrically simple and completely modern.
Unlike its boxy Illinois cousin, however, Mr. Fong's dwelling takes the jaunty form of a wedged-shaped doorstop. The dark-clad wedge yawns wide at its larger end, creating an exterior space that combines features of both porch and deck.
Instead of Mies's steel locally sourced timber has been used to frame the house.
In certain regards, the cottage is not an homage, but rather embodies a reaction against the Farnsworth House. Dr. Farnsworth complained loudly and litigiously about a few things, and one aspect of Mies's project she apparently didn't like at all was the transparent floor-to-ceiling glass all around, which allegedly made privacy impossible. (She could have drawn the drapes.)
The façades of the French River cottage, by way of contrast, comprise openings and shuttings, opaque walls and expanses of glass that frame two views only, one toward the adjacent lake, the other toward the dense greenness of a conservation area. Closing up the bunky in this way, exposing the interior to specific nearby landscapes but not everything there is to see, means that privacy never becomes an issue.
Mr. Fong's clients, whose children have grown up and moved on, wanted a refuge suitable for two. Because the site is too far from their Toronto home for easy weekend commuting, they tend to come up for a week or so at a time. They needed a place that is the right size for a couple without a young family to nest in comfortably - intimate when there are just the two of them, but spacious enough to accommodate the dinner parties they like to throw for friends and family members cottaging in the vicinity.
The inside, laid out to suit the temperament and living pattern of the clients, consists of one big, high-ceilinged room heated by an old-fashioned stove, a kitchen, a small bedroom and, tucked up under the metal roof, a sleeping loft accessed by a ladder. No doors (apart from the one to the washroom) interrupt the easy flow of space between zones. The absence of strong separations lends to the interior a relaxed, modern atmosphere.
Again like Mies's Farnsworth House, this cottage makes no apologies to the vernacular architecture of its rural region. It doesn't allude to barns or more conventional dwellings round about - although the building does have a shed-like look - and only its plain wood construction connects it to local building traditions. But the project does well on its own terms, which are those of the artistic and architectural modernism it is rooted in.

Full text:   After fixing some 'improvements' done by former owners, the natural beauty of this 1863 farmhouse shone once again
THE LISTING Asking price : $739,000
Taxes : $2,361.00
Lot size : 50 acres
Agent : Sandy Segal (Royal LePage ProAlliance Realty)
The back story J ohn Miller and Sandy Segal were feeling hemmed in by their small house and 19-footwide lot in Toronto when they began looking toward the bucolic landscape of Northumberland County.
They eased into country living by renting a few places in the rolling hills north of Port Hope, Ont. The town is served by a VIA Rail train that allowed Mr. Miller to commute to his teaching job at Ryerson University, where he served as chair of the School of Journalism.
"We ended up downsizing in 2001 to a rambling century house on 50 acres - a house we'd driven by many times - saying to ourselves, 'How would we feel if we bought or built another place, and the this one came on the market?' "Mr. Miller recalls.
The red-brick farmhouse, built in 1863, was originally owned by a Mr. Chambers, who founded the Presbyterian Church in the tiny hamlet of Knoxville. The church's graveyard still stands across the road from the house, which was dubbed Knoxvilla by a previous owner.
Built in Victorian style, the house has five bedrooms, two bathrooms and a wraparound veranda.
The 50 acres includes a managed forest of red and white pine trees planted in the 1960s. As the trees are harvested for telephone poles, the owners act as stewards who ensure the health of ecosystem.
Ms. Segal, who is also the listing agent for the estate, says the taxes are low because the provincial government offers tax incentives to landowners who participate in the sustainable forest program.
The property also has meadows, walking trails, perennial gardens and the remnants of an old mill.
A small stream that meanders through the land eventually flows into the Ganaraska River.
Mr. Miller says descendants of some of the families that have lived in the house over the years have shown up at the door. They share stories and also want to know how the property has fared over time.
"I've never lived in a house where so many have come back," Mr. Miller says. "People are drawn back to the house."
The house today
Most of the changes have taken place in the back half of the house, where a former summer kitchen was enclosed long ago and an addition has expanded the living space.
Today the large kitchen opens to a family room with views of the forest. The couple added a screened porch, which has become the preferred spot for dinners and gatherings.
Throughout, the couple undid many of the "improvements" made over the years.
"We tried to remain true to the way the house was conceived," Mr. Milller says.
In the dining room, for example, the couple tore out green shag carpeting and refurbished the wide pine boards.
Most of the original doors, windows and mouldings were intact, however, and the couple needed only to make a few repairs.
Ms. Segal says Mr. Chambers appears to have been well-off because the plaster mouldings and wood panelling would not typically be found in a traditional farmhouse. Upstairs, the couple tore down some old wallpaper and restored the wood floors, but first they held a smudging ceremony. The ancient ritual is believed to cleanse places of any negative energy that may have built up over time. The couple had also learned that a long-ago resident named Amos had died in the house from complications of appendicitis, so they addressed his spirit.
"We said, 'We're making a few changes. We think you'll like them,' "recalls Mr. Miller. "It was quite charming."
Outside, the couple cut through woods and meadows in order to create hiking trails. Today, deer and comical wild turkeys use the pathways through the forest as their highways, says Mr. Miller, adding that a group of local bird watchers spread out over the property and counted about 25 species of birds.
Mr. Miller, who began writing fiction following his retirement from Ryerson, says living in such peaceful and natural surroundings spurs his creativity.
"My best time is on the riding lawnmower. It's the best thinking time."
Ms. Segal says the couple has found the Port Hope community an interesting mix of long-time residents and newcomers from the city. The area is very open and gay-friendly, she adds, and draws lots of artists and creative types.
Mr. Miller adds that carpenters, stonemasons and other specialists have congregated in Port Hope because of the many heritage houses and the passion for restoring them.
People in town take the time to chat when they meet friends and acquaintances, he explains.
"Things slow down and people want to talk more. The whole time frame that you're used to in the city lengthens."
The best feature
The former summer kitchen at the rear of the house has been transformed into a large kitchen with white-painted cabinets and soapstone countertops. A large, open brick fireplace tucked into a corner under the rear staircase has a built-in bake oven. The warmth from the fire creates a cozy sitting area, the couple says.
The open kitchen, family room and screened porch provide great spaces for entertaining, they say.
"We see some of our Toronto friends more than we did in Toronto," Mr. Miller says.

Owners John Miller and Sandy Segal love the large kitchen that overlooks the forest in their Victorian-style farmhouse. Freud the dog no doubt loves the 50 acres of rolling hills, which include a stream.

Abstract: It's not my first taste of Vancouver. I've been spending time in the city since I was a girl, and I've done all the tourist favourites (Stanley Park, the Vancouver Aquarium, Granville Island, Gastown). But I've never lived in Vancouver, I've just been an outsider looking in. So on this short trip, I'm trying to delve deeper into aspects of the city that interest me most by trying a few new niche tours.

Full text:   It's a sunny Tuesday evening in June, and the 50-person tasting room at Vancouver's Brassneck Brewery is buzzing. On shelves near the front windows, rows of prettily designed refillable "growlers" wait to be filled with beer from the daily list of what's on tap. In the back, stools are packed with a crowd of twenty- and thirtysomethings sampling the brews. In my glass is a thirstquenching raspberry sour, whose "experimental" warning on the board simply made me want to try it more.
It's not my first taste of Vancouver. I've been spending time in the city since I was a girl, and I've done all the tourist favourites (Stanley Park, the Vancouver Aquarium, Granville Island, Gastown). But I've never lived in Vancouver, I've just been an outsider looking in. So on this short trip, I'm trying to delve deeper into aspects of the city that interest me most by trying a few new niche tours.
On my first evening, I meet Suzanne Rushton, owner of Vancouver Photowalks, whose city tours double as photography classes - or maybe it's the other way around. While many of her walks are geared for photography newbies, I've signed up for the nighttime tour of Gastown for those with a little more experience.
We learn to adjust shutter speed and aperture to smooth out the water and turn lights into multipoint stars; we wander over to the edges of Gastown and a corner that's prime real estate for longexposure cityscapes. I try different angles, catching shadows of people and buses in the frame and streaks of a car's bright taillights. After two hours with Suzanne, not only do I feel as if I know my camera twice as well as before, but I have also gained a new perspective on familiar neighbourhoods, and I'm going home with some of my coolest trip photos ever.
The next morning, I head back to the water for a tour that takes guests from Coal Harbour and under the Lions Gate Bridge around into False Creek. It sounds like standard tourist fare, except Sea Vancouver takes its guests out on a Zodiac, with passengers clad in bright orange survival suits. In addition to learning about the city, we zip around at top speeds and lean into tight turns when it strikes the captain's fancy.
Turns out everyone on my boat is a local, and the phrase "as you know" peppers the rehearsed speech about the development of the city and how it has become the envy of the world. I enjoy the seal's-eye view of Stanley Park's popular beaches, of Granville Island, of the vivid yellow pile of sulphur that stands watch over the working harbour. But the biggest rush is getting up close to the massive cargo ships that dot the harbour as they wait to enter the narrow passage. The parade of ships is a dramatic symbol of the sheer amount of stuff that enters and exists this port city. The adrenalin surge from that potent mixture of sun, fresh air and high-speed boating lasts long after I've stripped off the survival suit.
I'm feeling less like an interloper and more like a Vancouverite playing tourist. But I'm not done yet.
It's said there are some 50-odd microbreweries in Greater Vancouver, thanks to a provincewide explosion in the popularity of craft beer, and tonight, rather than signing up for an official tour, I recruit a friend to show me around. That's how we ended up at Brassneck in the up-and-coming neighbourhood of Mount Pleasant (about three kilometres from downtown). Brassneck opened last fall and has become the go-to spot for locals.
After a drink, we move on to Main Street Brewing Company, which opened in May, just a few minutes' walk away. My friend runs into her neighbours and they chat about condo politics as I dig into my grilled sandwich, along with the tasting flight our server sets on the table: one small glass each of the brewery's Pilsner, Brown Ale, Sessional and Southern Hop.
We end the night with another short walk to 33 Acres, which, at just a year old, is the senior member of the neighbourhood brewpubs. Like the other two, it's busy, and the customers spill into the street but we manage to secure a pair of chairs and a side table. The beverages are bright and lighttasting, a refreshing finale that has me plotting real-estate purchases (or, let's be honest, rentals) in this most photogenic of cities. A city in which I'm starting to feel very much at home.

Full text:   Resurgent Liberals smell opportunities to raise funds and lure voters on the East Coast
Jon Dimick III is the lord of Overtheway, a 7,200-squarefoot shingled mansion with one of the best views of Mahone Bay in this seaside village on Nova Scotia's south shore.
The five-bedroom, seven-bathroom home, painted green with an elegant "French" elevator (to move heavy luggage) and covered veranda, has been in Mr. Dimick's family since his greatgrandfather, Andrew Anderson, a doctor, philanthropist and former mayor of St. Augustine, Fla., built it in 1905, employing more than 200 craftsmen, including local shipwrights. It got its name because it was just over the way from a friend's property.
In late August, before the "gin and Jaguar" set - as the wealthy Haligonians, Torontonians and Americans who summer in Chester are affectionately called - prepare to decamp, Overtheway will be the venue for a major political fundraiser.
Federal Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau will be at the house for a $500-a-ticket meet-and-greet. About 150 people are expected. The next day, Mr. Trudeau will be in the suburban Halifax home of local business mogul Mickey MacDonald for a smaller but more intimate event: 75 to 80 guests, each paying $1,000.
In Atlantic Canada, Liberals are riding high in the polls, and Mr. Trudeau is attracting money, supporters and new people to run for his team. And in Chester, the Grits, who have traditionally been as scarce as Chevrolets on the village streets, see an opportunity to improve their fortunes in the next election.
Chester, renowned for its spectacular sailing, reliable winds on Mahone Bay and its August race week, which attracts hundreds of yachters and revellers from across North America, is part of the federal riding of South ShoreSt. Margaret's. It is not known for electing Liberals.
"We've had a hard time recruiting candidates there, we've had a hard time raising money there, and this summer, we have the leader doing one of our biggest fundraisers of the year ... in that riding," says Kirk Cox, the cochair of the federal Liberal campaign in Nova Scotia.
They hope the largesse they plan to tap from some of the most powerful people in the well-heeled enclave can help deliver votes in the riding in 2015.
Since 1968, only one Liberal has been elected there, and that was for one term - from 1993 to 1997 - in the Chretien sweep. The rest of the time, Tories have ruled. In fact, in the 2011 federal election, the Liberal candidate was a distant third, earning less than 18 per cent of the vote.
But the popular incumbent, Conservative MP Gerald Keddy, is retiring, leaving the riding wide open for 2015 - and creating new possibilities for the Liberals.
Usually, Mr. Cox says, the Liberals are "lucky" to find one person, or maybe, two, to run for the nomination. But he believes people are seeing the party rebounding, getting organized and "they know if they decide to throw their hat in the ring it's not a long shot and there will be support for them, too."
Nova Scotia has 11 ridings - the NDP represents three; the Liberals and Conservatives each have four. One other Conservative incumbent MP, Greg Kerr in West Nova, is also not running again - another opportunity for the Liberals to gain a seat. The Liberals and Tories have each won seven elections since 1968 in that riding.
So consistently have the Trudeau Liberals been ahead in the public opinion polls in the province, however, that Don Mills, president of Corporate Research Associates, the regional polling firm, says: "The numbers suggest that no seats are safe for the Conservatives ..." In South Shore-St. Margaret's, one candidate, Jennifer Naugler, a young mother and school board chair, has already been "green-lit" by the national campaign team (after background checks and interviews) to seek the nomination. More are expected with the nomination meeting to be held in the fall, showing the increased level of interest in the riding.
The Harper Conservatives say they have "plenty" of serious potential candidates, but the nomination has not yet been opened.
Having a Trudeau in Chester, meanwhile, is not a new thing. Mr. Dimick says Mr. Trudeau's father, former prime minister Pierre Trudeau, came to the village for the summer to enjoy its scenery and hospitality. Even now, Chester is still full of famous faces, including a former bank president, a seafood billionaire and a magnate who made his fortune in moving and storage.
Mr. Dimick is a real estate developer, and plans to sell Overtheway soon. Playing host there to a party leader, and a Liberal one at that, is something new. His father, John Dimick II, was a dyedin-the-wool Tory. Mr. Dimick says he votes for the candidate and not the party. But, he adds, "I'm not sure Harper is the guy."

Scott Baker has a rarefied view of Toronto's real estate market.
"We tend to look at it from 40,000 feet."
Indeed, as the manager of a private pool of real estate assets, he looks at the broader housing picture in North America from that height.
Mr. Baker, a senior vice-president with Toronto-based MacNicol & Associates Asset Management, manages several alternative asset pools.
One of those is the MacNicol 360 Degree Realty Income Fund.
Mr. Baker gets a pretty good look across North America through investing in third-party managed funds with "extreme local knowledge."
The Toronto market, he says, is driven by powerful trends that are not likely to end any time soon.
"All the money's flowing into Toronto. Everything looks good."
But precisely for that reason, his firm doesn't own much real estate in Toronto.
"We don't see any value," he says.
"That's completely different from the trends. The trends are all positive ... that's the paradox."
Looking first at the bulls' view, Mr. Baker recalls how Canada avoided much of the fallout from the global financial crisis and U.S. housing market collapse that started in 2008.
Big money around the world began looking at Canada's conservative banking system with new respect, he says.
"We escaped pretty much unscathed through the recession."
Those investors see Toronto as a secure place to put capital, a global financial centre, a 24-hour city and a cultural powerhouse.
He points to the large influx of immigrants, for example, and the "Manhattanization" of Toronto caused by vast numbers of people choosing to live downtown rather than in the suburbs.
Meanwhile, the greenbelt around the city has limited sprawl and the Great Lake to the south prevents expansion in that direction. The City of Toronto and many surrounding municipalities are committed to increasing density.
Builders are also putting up more townhouses and semis on smaller lots because land is so expensive.
"Developers are packing more people into smaller areas."
Condominium towers downtown continue to fill up, he points out - and there are still projects with untold numbers of units on the books.
"Toronto is the condo capital of North America, hands-down."
He expects people will have to get used to living in smaller places because only the top earners in double-income families can afford a detached house approaching the $1-million mark.
Interest rates are low and international capital is pouring in.
Huge institutions such as pension funds and real estate investment trusts have cash to burn, he says. Too much institutional money combined with all that positive sentiment pushes up the risk, in his view.
For a fund to expect a good rate of return, he adds, "you're betting that these trends are going to continue and there's no increase in interest rates."
For the bearish view, Mr. Baker points to the risk to the market if interest rates rise substantially.
People in Toronto are buying single-family houses that suck up as much as 60 per cent of pretax income.
Prices, meanwhile, can't continue to rise faster than the rate of inflation forever. The math doesn't work.
"It just can't sustain itself."
Taking a long view, he doesn't see the risk/reward ratio as very attractive.
"Everybody's very levered here in Canada."
So where does Mr. Baker have holdings?
"We're looking below where the big money wants to be."
After 2008, Mr. Baker says, money managers could invest almost blindly in the United States.
His firm was part of a syndicate, for example, that bought projects in Miami's South Beach, finished them off and sold them.
His fund is not interested in big trophy projects; today they are finding the highest quality and lowest risk in the secondary cities. Jacksonville, Fla., is one city where he's seeing opportunity, along with places in Texas and Georgia.
As for residents of Toronto who are not running money but just wondering whether to buy a place to live, Mr. Baker says that is a question he gets asked from time to time.
One relative who rents a condo recently asked if he should buy.
Mr. Baker says it really comes down to a lifestyle preference.
He says the best value now seems to be in 10- to 15-year-old condo projects. If you are budget conscious, look at some of the older ones that are well-maintained, he suggests.
If someone doesn't need to own, he adds, they may be better off putting their savings into other asset classes and waiting for a correction in the market.
Not - he hastens to add - that he is predicting one.
But he thinks it's a good idea for people with a short time horizon to be cautious. Anyone looking to own a place for 20 years or more doesn't need to be as careful. Also, he advises caution about borrowing because no one wants to be under water on a mortgage.
"If you're going to buy a house in Toronto at these fully inflated prices, don't use a lot of debt."
Mr. Baker urges Canadians to remember the pain of the early 1990s. Buyers who bought in 1989 got killed, he says.
"People get lulled into thinking this can never happen. [That] this time it's different."
But he points to the United States for an example of a downturn that blindsided many. Millions, he says, lost their homes.
"In the U.S., virtually no one saw it coming."
For now Toronto remains strong and he agrees with the bulls who see the positive trends continuing. But investors should weigh the risk.
"Be cautious," is his advice.
"I wouldn't be buying those things thinking you're going to get rich. It could be the opposite. You could get poor."

Full text:   Small research firm fills information gap in Toronto
At a time when cranes dot the Toronto skyline and economists debate the possibility of a real estate bubble, Altus Group Ltd. has scooped up one of the leading sources of data on the closely scrutinized condo market.
Toronto-based Altus Group is a TSX-listed company that specializes in providing advice and information to the commercial real estate industry, including major owners of office towers and factories, such as pension plans and real estate investment trusts. It has struck a deal to buy RealNet Canada Inc ., a smaller firm that gathers its own data on the commercial market but also researches the construction and sale of new homes and condos in Toronto.
The deal illustrates the demand for information about Toronto's condo market in particular, which economists and policy-makers have expressed concern about, amid a boom in construction. Local real estate boards and the Canadian Real Estate Association, which represents Realtors, track information on sales of existing houses and condos over the Multiple Listing Service. But a few private firms such as RealNet have filled an information gap by doing their own research on sales and construction of new houses and condos - information that has become increasingly valuable amid speculation about overvaluation and overbuilding.
The deal also highlights the increasing overlap between commercial and residential real estate. When residential real estate was largely made up of houses, it was seen to be quite distinct from commercial real estate such as office towers, industrial complexes and shopping centres. But with cities aiming to curb urban sprawl and promote densification in their downtown cores, so-called mixed-use developments (which might contain, for example, condos and offices) are increasingly common.
One of Altus's growth initiatives recently has been to ramp up in the residential space, says Colin Johnston, president of Canadian research, valuation and advisory at Altus Group. Altus has been tracking and selling some data on the residential markets in Calgary and Montreal, but it lacked data on Toronto.
"There's just such demand in the residential sector," Mr. Johnston says. "People ask 'what's the risk, is it overbuilt, is there too much development?' "RealNet tracks information such as the price paid for land, sales and prices of new houses and condos, and the total inventory of condos that are planned, under construction and complete.

Full text:   In Montreal, the city's finest pâtisseries are located in some of the best neighbourhoods to explore, making it easy to work off all those chocolate-hazelnut-cherry triple cream puffs
Visiting a city the first time is easy: Every street yields new discoveries, every top-rated attraction is a fresh experience. But the second, the fifth, the 10th visit? You have to get creative. Setting out with a themed mission is a great way to go. In Montreal, for instance, seeking out the latest and greatest pastry shops offer up prime carb-loading and caffeinating - plus an entry point to the city's most happening neighbourhoods. Got your stretchy pants packed? Here are five spots to try.
RUSTIQUE PIE KITCHEN
The neighbourhood : Up-andcoming St. Henri - not far from Westmount - is "becoming an amazing food area" thanks to a stream of new restaurants on main street Notre Dame, says coowner Jacqueline Berman.
The shop : Framed shots of the bakery's own pies and cookies adorn the white walls. Three tables inside are crowded with locals lingering as much over conversation as over sweets and coffee from 49th Parallel, a Vancouver-based ethical roaster.
Shelves hold jars of granola and other take-home goodies, while glass cases are piled high with pies of the mini- and full-size variety, in seasonal and timeless flavours.
Most popular : Classic Quebec apple, and lemon meringue, which some say is the best in the city.
We tried : A flaky, fruity muffintin-size rhubarb pie, a steal at $1.99.
The calorie earner : Across the street, Square Sir-George-étiennecartier offers tennis courts, plenty of picnic-friendly green space and an outdoor pool open daily with free admission.
4615 rue Notre Dame Ouest, rustiquepiekitchen.com
PÂTISSERIE RHUBARBE
The neighbourhood : A residential corner of the perennially popular Plateau, which chef and owner Stephanie Labelle describes as bobo, or bourgeois bohème - "a lot of families, artists and people enjoying good things of life."
The shop : A nondescript building with partially updated 1970s interior. Decor does not matter, though, as your eyes will be drawn to the white-painted shelves holding preserves, granola and copies of the Montreal Gazette - not to mention the glass-fronted cases filled with rows of eclairs, pots de crème, square cheesecakes topped with cubes of sour cherry jelly and other delights. Sunday mornings fill up fast thanks to a popular brunch.
Most popular : In season (spring), the namesake rhubarb tart; in summer, the strawberry-based fraisier.
We tried : The nutty, crunchy pistachio-grapefruit dacquoise and, in a cute, stamped brown paper to-go bag, a chamomile macaron.
The calorie earner : The shop's a bit of a walk from the nearest Metro station, so it's worth staying in the area to explore. Head to nearby Parc Sir-Wilfrid-Laurier for a run, a swim or a game of petanque. 5091 rue de Lanaudière, patisserierhubarbe.com
DE FARINE & D'EAU FRAÎCHE
The neighbourhood : The Village, whose LGBT community base is diversifying, as young families and artists move in thanks to affordable real estate.
The shop : Chef Marilu Gunji, who was raised in Japan and graduated in pastry from Le Cordon Bleu. She brings her detail-oriented style to a wealth of pastries, cakes and cookies as well as savoury dishes. Tiny, perfectly decorated cakes sit under bell jars on white shelves along one wall.
Most popular : The passion-fruit cake, which came recommended by a fellow customer (a Montrealer who rides in daily on a Bixi rented bike for his regular snack).
We tried: The picture-perfect, melt-in-your-mouth triple cream puff in chocolate-hazelnut-cherry, topped with miniature fresh mint leaves.
The calorie earner : Gunji likes to burn off steam at Moksha Yoga in the nearby Plateau. Or rent a Bixi from the station around the corner and take it for a tour on the separated bike lanes along nearby boulevard De Maisonneuve. 1701 rue Amherst, dfef.ca
MAISON CHRISTIAN FAURE
The neighbourhood : Picturesque Old Montreal, where some of New France's first settlers landed in 1642. Nowadays, the tourist traps are receding in favour of some of the hottest places to eat - and to be seen.
The shop: Chef Christian Faure and his wife and business partner, Pamela Bakalian, created a space where historic appeal (think classic Quebecois grey stone walls) co-exists with modern elements such as clean white tables and acrylic chairs. They also run a pastry school that offers a professional program as well as classes for "serious amateurs" and "little bakers" (i.e., kids).
Most popular : The eclair ParisBrest, choux pastry filled with a praline-hazelnut mousse that's lighter than the traditional buttercream.
We tried : The sweet-tart Tarte passion framboise , whose precise flower-like design of fresh raspberries and passionfruit cream showcases the shop's mission of providing accessible luxury pastry.
The calorie earner : Walk or cycle the nearby waterfront trails for a voyageur's-eye view of the heart of Montreal. Quadricycles - multipassenger pedal-powered vehicles - and pedalboats, in which to cruise the Bonsecours Basin are available for rent from company écorecreo (ecorecreo.ca). 355 Place Royale, maisonchristianfaure.ca PATRICE PÂTISSIER
The neighbourhood: Little Burgundy, near Atwater Market and home to plenty of antiques stores and popular restaurants such as Joe Beef and Vin Papillon.
The shop : Local TV personality and pastry chef Patrice Demers, formerly of critics' favourite Les 400 Coups, started the shop along with business partner Jean-François Archambault to showcase his sophisticated, modern-looking creations, often featuring citrus and seasonal fruits.
Most popular : Kouign Amann, a sweet, ultra buttery croissant-like pastry; St. Henri coffee cake, using coffee from the namesake local roaster.
We tried: A thick and creamy chocolate ganache sandwiched between tender-crisp sablé cookies with only a bare minimum of sweetness. It is a chocoholic's dream.
The calorie earner : Do as Patrice does (as well as many Montrealers) and go for a run along the scenic Lachine Canal. Or take a kayaking lesson or tour from nearby H2O Adventures (h2oadventures.com). 2360 rue Notre Dame Ouest, patricepatissier.ca

Full text:   Mayor Gregor Robertson has offered in the past week to get Vancouver to buy highly prized chunks of property - the hugely popular Granville Island and the Canadian Pacific Railway line that has become a favoured strip for walking, biking and community gardens on the west side.
But no one can say the price of either property.
And, in the case of Granville Island, a spokeswoman for the federal government says it's not even clear whether Ottawa can sell the 15-hectare island, which was transformed from industrial uses to a popular farmers' and artists' market in the 1970s.
"There is legislation that covers the selling of Crown assets," said Teresa Amoroso, the communications officer for Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp., the government department that currently manages Granville Island.
She said the corporation's legal department, in response to a question from The Globe and Mail, is checking to see what restrictions govern the use or resale of that land.
Neither she nor anyone at the city knew the value of Granville Island, although one real estate analyst said a rough guess, based on a couple of pieces of property inside it that have been valued, might be about $245-million.
A spokesman from the mayor's office, Braeden Caley, also said he didn't have any information on the value of the 11-kilometre CP Rail line that the city is offering to buy, even though the city has done an internal appraisal. The City of Richmond recently purchased a large stretch of CP Rail line for $5-million.
Mr. Robertson has a motion going to council Tuesday asking city staff to explore buying or leasing Granville Island as a way of retaining local control, in the face of recent news that it may be passed from CMHC to Port Metro Vancouver.
On Sunday, his office issued another release with the offer to purchase the rail corridor, which the city and CP have been scrapping over since 2000.
That year, the city abruptly rezoned it as a transportation corridor after CP made some preliminary moves to develop housing along it.
CP fought the city to the Supreme Court of Canada to challenge the legality of that rezoning and lost in 2006.
Recently, it has told residents along the line to remove anything interfering with its use so that CP can use it as a rail corridor again, which the mayor has objected to.
"The City had an independent appraisal done of the Arbutus Corridor lands, and is prepared to pay fair market value for the land," Sunday's release quoted Mr. Robertson as saying. "The City is committed to seeking a fair deal with CPR for the Arbutus Corridor lands, so that we can maintain and enhance the Corridor for local residents." In the case of both pieces of land, there's been a lot of alarm from local residents and some businesses about potential changes to them.
Residents who use the CPR tracks for community gardens are aghast that CP is ordering them to stop using what has become a lush greenway through the city's west side.
In the case of Granville Island, City Councillor Geoff Meggs said people are worried about having a place that is all about local businesses and culture run by an agency like Port Metro Vancouver, which is focused primarily on managing the harbour and shipping.
But an architect who helped transform Granville Island in the 1970s said there are advantages to having the federal government, not the city, run it.
Joost Bakker said Granville Island was able to be developed with the lighting, quirky roadways, and creative mix of industrial, artistic and commercial space that is has because it didn't have to comply with city building and zoning bylaws.
George Affleck, a councillor with the minority Non-Partisan Association on council, said he had real concerns with the city's efforts to take over the island.
"I don't see how Vancouver could ever afford to take it over," he said.
The federal government currently provides subsidies to keep artists' rents low, something that would be a big burden if only Vancouver taxpayers were covering it.
Mr. Affleck said having the city control the rail corridor is probably a good idea, but he suspects "the cost would be astronomical."

Full text:   Veteran rocker has joined owners of Toronto franchises in hiring Goldman Sachs to help them bid for football club
Rocker Jon Bon Jovi is part of a Toronto group that has retained a banking firm and submitted paperwork expressing interest in buying the Buffalo Bills, three people who have reviewed documents regarding the sale process told The Associated Press on Friday.
It is unclear if the group would eventually want to move the NFL team to Toronto. The club is on the market after Hall of Fame owner Ralph Wilson died in March.
The three people spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity Friday because the process is private and the Toronto group has not revealed its intentions.
The group includes Larry Tanenbaum and the Rogers family. Tanenbaum is chairman of Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment, which controls the NHL's Maple Leafs and NBA's Raptors.
The Rogers family includes Edward Rogers, who is deputy chairman of Rogers, the Torontobased communications giant.
The group is on a list of prospective buyers who have submitted a nondisclosure agreement form to Morgan Stanley, the banking firm overseeing the Bills sale. The Toronto group has retained the Goldman Sachs banking firm to assist in the bid.
Bon Jovi previously expressed interest in owning an NFL franchise but never specifically mentioned the Bills. This is the first real indication linking him to Tanenbaum and Rogers.
One of the people confirmed that Bon Jovi discussed his interests during a restaurant meeting last month with the NFL commissioner.
The Bills most recently were valued by Forbes at $870-million (U.S.). They are projected to be sold for at least $1-billion, partly because NFL teams rarely go on the market.
The team is essentially locked into playing at Ralph Wilson Stadium through the 2019 season because of a strict nonrelocation clause included in a 10-year lease agreement reached with New York State and Erie County, where the stadium is located, in December of 2012.
The Bills would incur a $400million penalty by even broaching the prospect of moving during the lease's term. There is a one-time exception that would allow the Bills to break the lease for just under $28.4-million in 2020.
Of about 60 nondisclosure forms sent out by Morgan Stanley in June, at least 10 have been returned, two of the people said.
Among those also listed as returning their forms are Buffalo Sabres owners Terry and Kim Pegula and New York City real estate mogul Donald Trump.
The forms were required in order for prospective bidders to gain access to financial and background information on the franchise to begin formulating their bids.
The next step is for prospective bidders to submit another set of forms - including their own financial information - by July 29 to gain more access to the Bills' financial information.
One of the people said Morgan Stanley has informed prospective buyers that the Bills made just under $30-million in net profits last season. And Morgan Stanley projects that number will double by 2019 as a result of the NFL's TV contract, current renovations taking place at the stadium and other potential local sources of income.

Full text:   To reach architect-designed Georgian Bay mainland cottage, you must take a boat (or skate in the frozen winter months)
THE LISTING
Asking price : $3.295-million
Agents : Paul Crammond and Sheila Waengler (Chestnut Park Real Estate Ltd.)
Taxes : $18,200 (which includes two adjoining vacant parcels, for sale separately) .
The back story
The craggy point at the end of the Tadenac Peninsula was vacant land owned by the privately held Tadenac Fishing Club when the late James McCutcheon purchased it in the 1970s.
Mr. McCutcheon was a lawyer who asked his former University of Toronto fraternity brother, architect Peter Warren, to design a cottage for his family in a remote location dubbed "A World Apart."
Following his studies at U of T, Mr. Warren had gone on to earn a master of architecture degree at Yale University and then started his career at the Torontobased Parkin Partnership. There he was part of a team that worked on the Art Gallery of Ontario and Bell Trinity Square.
When he wasn't working on cultural landmarks and corporate edifices, Mr. Warren sometimes designed cottages and country houses for family and friends.
"It was an interesting kind of process," says Mr. Warren, explaining that the zoning requirements were quite restrictive on Georgian Bay. They brought in local builder Leonard Roi for the job.
They chose a site that took advantage of the rock formation and the outlook, then set about designing a cottage that wouldn't appear too obtrusive.
"We wanted to make it look as comfortable as possible on the rock."
The modern building had cedar shingles that weathered gradually to blend into the surroundings.
Over time, one cottage expanded into a family compound.
Mr. Warren designed an addition to the main cottage that virtually created a second residence. It was allowed under the zoning rules because the two parts had a continuous roofline.
"As long as you're connected by a roof, it's still one building."
Mr. Warren recalls spending a lot of time to make a smooth transition between the two parts. When it came to designing the boathouse and other building's, Mr. McCutcheon insisted that all of the rooflines be the same.
"We had some fun with it," says the architect.
The property is on the mainland but feels more like an island because there's no road leading to it, says real estate agent Paul Crammond of Chestnut Park Real Estate Ltd. To reach the cottage, residents and their guests drive to King Bay Marina at the end of Twelve Mile Bay Road. From there, it takes about five minutes of calm boating to reach the property.
"It's a really protected boat ride," says Mr. Crammond, adding that it's also a good place to land a float plane.
Mr. Crammond, who is based in the town of Port Carling in Muskoka, says that, although Georgian Bay and Muskoka are not a great distance apart geographically, they have quite different cultures. Cottages tend to be much farther apart in the Georgian Bay area, and navigating the 30,000 Islands by boat is far more challenging.
"I think that people on the Bay don't think that Muskokans are real cottagers," he observes.
The cottage today
The cottage sits on a 12-acre property with 1,200 feet of contoured shoreline. There's a small, curving sandy beach and lots of sloping rock that provides gentle access to the water.
"They love all the waterfront activities that kids can do safely," Mr. Crammond says.
There's a dry-dock boathouse and a dock for several boats.
The modern cottage is built of British Columbia cedar with wall-to-wall expanses of windows. The roof lines are kept low so that the cottage blends into the terrain.
"It doesn't tower over the land," Mr. Crammond says.
"When you look at it from the boat, it looks as if it's part of the land."
The main cottage provides 3,400 square feet of living space centred around a combined living and dining room with high ceilings, clerestory windows and a stone fireplace. A separate kitchen opens to a large screened porch.
A master-bedroom suite and four other bedrooms provide lots of sleeping accommodations. A family room behind the kitchen gives kids an indoor place to gather for games or to watch movies.
The main cottage is winterized, Mr. Crammond says, which means family members can walk across the ice from the marina when they want to visit during the winter.
The self-contained guest wing attached to the main cottage has two bedrooms, a bathroom, kitchenette and living area.
There's also a two-bedroom guest cottage. An enclosed pavilion can be used for large family gatherings or it can serve as a gym and yoga studio on rainy days.
From the shore, Mr. Crammond points toward two uninhabited "picnic islands" of flat rock which shelter the dock from western winds and also provide more tranquil spots from which to watch the sunset.
"They take a flotilla with kayaks and canoes," Mr. Crammond says of the McCutcheon family.
Farther out, the American Camp Islands are owned by the charitable Georgian Bay Land Trust. "The neat thing about those picnic islands is you can look right over them," he says.
"They don't block your view but they sure block the waves."
Behind the property, land is privately held by the members of the Tadenac Fishing Club.
Besides the main property, the two vacant adjoining parcels are also offered for sale by the family.
The best feature
Mr. Crammond says the secluded setting of the cottage makes it particularly private.
"You see boats going by but they're not coming 20 feet off your dock. They can't."
In some cottage areas, people drive to the golf course or head into town for shopping. On Georgian Bay, the natural landscape is the draw.
"It's traditional cottaging," says Mr. Crammond. "You and your family and your neighbours create your own entertainment."

Abstract: On the other hand, banks have every reason to lend in situations where home prices seem to be lagging behind income growth or other fundamentals. If the Canadian banks' generally rah-rah attitude toward the real estate market is justified, they should do very well under a reengineered mortgage system because they'll be able to grab a modest chunk of the capital gains when homes are sold.

Full text:   A smart way to cushion Canada's economy from future housing bubbles involves nothing more than re-engineering our mortgages.
In their new book, House of Debt , Atif Mian and Amir Sufi argue that out-of-control housing prices tend to inflict longlasting pain on a country's economy, but much of that distress can be avoided. The key? Forcing banks and other lenders to share in the ups and downs of the real estate cycle by requiring them to bear part of the cost if a housing boom implodes.
The authors, who teach at Princeton and the University of Chicago, are mostly concerned with the U.S. housing debacle, but their work deserves attention in any country that suspects it, too, may be suffering from real estate dementia.
Canadians, in particular, may want to lend an ear. The soaring sales volumes and steadily rising prices reported by the Canadian Real Estate Association on Tuesday indicate that consumers here are still wildly optimistic about the outlook for residential real estate. Observers outside the country are far less sanguine, however. Both investment research firm Morningstar and credit rater Fitch published reports in the past few days that argue Canadian home prices are at least 20 per cent overvalued.
Many housing skeptics believe Canadian regulators should dial down the real estate euphoria by raising down payment requirements and imposing more severe financial tests on mortgage applicants. But previous fiddling has failed to rein in the general bullishness about housing.
The two professors propose an idea with far more teeth. They suggest rewriting mortgage contracts so that a homeowner's payments and principal shrink if an index of local home prices declines. In effect, their system would shove part of the losses onto the shoulders of the mortgage holder. (Yes, in Canada that would be mostly you, Big Six banks.) In return, the lender would get a 5-per-cent slice of any capital gains on the house when it is sold or refinanced.
Notice how this changes, well, everything. Suddenly lenders would no longer be just dispensers of cash, but active participants in the housing market.
Since they would now feel the pain if home prices fall, they have a compelling reason to cut back on lending to home buyers if they figure a market is growing overheated.
On the other hand, banks have every reason to lend in situations where home prices seem to be lagging behind income growth or other fundamentals. If the Canadian banks' generally rah-rah attitude toward the real estate market is justified, they should do very well under a reengineered mortgage system because they'll be able to grab a modest chunk of the capital gains when homes are sold.
Profs. Mian and Sufi acknowledge that forcing banks to eat part of a housing downturn might be seen as a get-out-ofjail-free card for consumers who foolishly take on too much debt.
But they argue that it creates powerful incentives for lenders not to give money to those spendthrifts in the first place.
And, they say, it is more than justified by the potential savings from avoiding a home-price collapse.
The authors of House of Debt make a persuasive case that a housing bubble is nearly always poisonous for a country. Unlike a stock market crash, a plunge in home prices hits hardest at young families and working-class people. It wipes out the modest equity they have built up in their residences and prevents them from spending for years to come.
A general rush to sell real estate also drags down property prices in general and so hurts even people who are financially stable and prosperous. As their net worth falls, they, too, cut back on spending.
For all those reasons, history shows that housing bubbles are usually followed by extremely long periods of slow economic growth. Revamping our mortgage system seems a small price to pay for protection from that calamity.

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/queens-faces-king-sized-noise-problem/docview/1544488492/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "A sports field where games are played kind of inherently needs whistles," said Leslie Dal Cin, Queen's athletic director. "And if we can't get that application to say we can use the sports fields with whistles then we really can't play on those fields.

Full text:   For a group of residents in Kingston who live next to the university, sounds from sporting events have become an annoyance
The strains of O Canada , a referee's whistle and squawks of play calling over the public address system are all the sounds that spring from live sporting events.
But for a group of residents in Kingston who live next to Queen's University, these noises have become such an annoyance that they are demanding the school silence the fanfare from its fields of play, a move that could threaten varsity athletics if the school's neighbours get their way.
"Last summer it got so loud that it would interrupt your ability to speak to your neighbour in your front yard," Rosemary Hill, a real estate agent who lives close to the campus fields on Oakridge Avenue, said in a telephone interview. "It really does interfere with your ability to live your life."
The matter will come to a head on Tuesday when the City of Kingston will hold a council meeting where a temporary exemption that the university is seeking to a local noise bylaw is on the agenda.
Queen's is arguing that the bylaw as written is far too general in scope and does not really take into account the sounds that normally emanate from a modern live sporting event, including piped-in music to entertain the crowds during stoppages in play.
Queen's is arguing that if it does not receive the exemptions it is seeking - including the right to continue to allow referees' whistles and amplified sound during events - it will severely affect the future of the school's storied intercollegiate sports programs, which date back to 1882.
"A sports field where games are played kind of inherently needs whistles," said Leslie Dal Cin, Queen's athletic director. "And if we can't get that application to say we can use the sports fields with whistles then we really can't play on those fields. That's where our issue is in terms of the continuation of our sports."
Further to that, Queen's is arguing that restrictions around the use of the PA system would mean the university would not be compliant with hosting standards for sporting events as outlined by Ontario University Athletics, the association in which the Golden Gaels compete.
"It will be nearly impossible for Queen's to host tournaments, national championships and other high-profile events, which help build the profile of Queen's and the City of Kingston as a sports tourism destination that would draw thousands of visitors to Kingston each year," the university claims on its website.
Any moves to allow Queen's additional leeway to the bylaw are being vigorously opposed by many who live close to the campus fields, and who complain that the university has long ignored their pleas to rectify noise complaints.
"If we don't stand up to this big bully Queen's it's going to get worse," said Hill, a resident for 12 years, who adds she can no longer enjoy sitting out in her backyard when a big game is being played on the university campus.
"This is about having to force Queen's to do the right thing - to design and operate fields that meet minimum noise standards," Susan Reid, another Oakridge Avenue resident and an employee of the university, wrote in an e-mail to The Globe and Mail.
The campus of the august institution is located near the heart of this Eastern Ontario city of 123,000 and nestled side by side with a number of established residential neighbourhoods that overlook the grounds of one of Canada's oldest universities.
According to Kingston city councillor Liz Schell, about 1,000 individual homes have been affected by the noise. The university, on its web site, claims that "a small number of people" who live near the fields have formally complained about undue noise.
The area residents have been at odds with the university administrators for several years over what they say has been an escalating level of sound from the seven outdoor athletic fields - including Richardson Stadium, the 8,000-plus seat facility that opened in 1972 - on what is referred to as the West Campus.
The complaints started to escalate in 2011 after the university installed a new artificial turf field with surrounding lights that led to heavy use, both day and night and throughout the weekends.
"The lights on the playing fields made people's backyards at 10 o'clock at night as bright as midday," said Kingston city councillor William Glover.
The city ordered that the university not use the lighting system until shields could be installed to redirect the glare away from homes and onto the playing surface.
According to Schell, the biggest concern among the residents is the ramped-up music that is played during events.
"The groups that used the field used amplified music pretty much all last summer," she said.
"It's caused such upset in the neighbourhood."
In its application for an exemption to the city's noise bylaw, Queen's is seeking the ability to blow game whistles, make intermittent game-related P.A. announcements and sing or play the national anthem.
And for Richardson Stadium, where the school's football team plays its regular-season games, the university is seeking the right to play music during time-outs and other breaks in the action.
Also, the university said that it will only use its athletic fields from between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m.
"We've been working to try and find that appropriate balance between what we need in terms of sound coming from an athletic field to something that is respectful within the community," Dal Cin said. "We think our latest application, which really tries to hone in on numbers and types of sounds, finds that balance."
A staff report on what Queen's is seeking recommends that council adopt the measure.
"It's not the whistles, it's not the hooting and hollering," Schell said. "It's the amplified sound.
It's a slightly elevated field and the sound just blasts the neighbourhood.
"If they do it right like they say they're going to, it should work."

Full text:   BUILDER Fieldgate Homes
DEVELOPER TACC Developments
SIZE Townhouses from 1,571 square feet; detached from 2,470 square feet
PRICE Townhouses from $480,000s; detached homes from $730,000s
SALES CENTRE Northeast corner of Mavrinac Boulevard and Wellington Street in Aurora. Open Monday to Thursday from 1 p.m. to 8 p.m.; Friday by appointment; weekends from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.
CONTACT Phone or visit auroratrails.com or fieldgatehomes.com
A low-rise development bounded by Marsh and Weslie creeks in Aurora will set aside more than 40 per cent of the area for green spaces.
Developed by TACC Developments, the master-planned community of Aurora Trails encompasses environmental protection areas, storm-water management ponds and a 16kilometre trail system. There will also be several parks, including a five-acre recreation area with sports fields, ball courts, playgrounds, a splash pad and gazebo.
"The developer worked closely with the town of Aurora and the region to create quite a special piece of land," says Jim Andrews, director of sales and marketing for Fieldgate Homes, which is building the site's 550 homes alongside Arista Homes, Paradise Developments and Opus Homes.
"Aurora Trails is part of one of the greenest communities."
A plantation of endangered butternut trees and a group of oaks will be another attraction in the project at the southwest corner of Leslie Street and St. John's Sideroad, 30 minutes north of Toronto.
"The street patterns, cul-desacs and different things being created all work with the views in mind from the different lots," he adds. "We have a number of our lots that are 43-feet [wide] backing onto beautiful, treed areas."
Mid-June marked the grand unveiling of freehold townhouses, semi and detached homes offered by all four builders.
"This is one of the last communities to be developed in Aurora," Mr. Andrews says. "It's safe to say as a group, there wouldn't be any other location in Aurora that would have the same amount, variety and choice."
He estimates each builder has about 20 plans with multiple exterior and interior variations.
Fieldgate will offer townhouses on 20-foot lots and detached homes on 38- and 43-foot lots for phase one, which will begin occupancy in December, 2015.
"We want to create something special in every room if we can and make the home very livable," says Mr. Andrews, citing mudrooms off the garage and bathrooms and closets off the foyer. "We like to create options for people, so we'll do a standard plan, but we'll do an alternate plan."
For instance, a four-bedroom plan converts to a threebedroom layout with a study or media space. "These days, depending on the size of the family, you need more than one TV to make everybody happy," Mr. Andrews states.
Some of Fieldgate's standard appointments will include contemporary Arts and Crafts façades, granite counters, gas fireplaces, oak staircases and nine-foot ceilings.
Each builder will also incorporate green features, from ecofriendly materials and landscaping to energy-efficient systems and water-conservation measures.
A local, century-old landmark, Coltham Farm House, will be refurbished for residents' use and relocated to the site, which will also house a convenience store and services.
In addition, established restaurants, shops, schools, golf courses, GO Transit and major highways are nearby.

Boris Kholodov, Royal LePage Real Estate Services Ltd., Johnston & Daniel Division .
The Action : In a more-than-30year-old high-rise on the waterfront, next to Harbour Square Park and the ferry terminal, it can take a couple of months to sell most units, but this twobedroom suite was the exception. It took roughly 30 showings during the course of a few weeks to net an offer, even with other units available.
What They Got : On the upper floors of the Harbour Square residence, this 1,408-square-foot unit features a two-storey plan with wood floors and southeastfacing windows throughout.
There is an open living area with a Juliet balcony, a dining area and an updated kitchen with an island on the main floor, and directly above it is a bedroom with a Juliet balcony and a master suite with hisand-hers closets flanking the way to the larger of two full bathrooms.
A locker and two-car parking are additional features. The unit has a monthly fee of $1,036 to pay for utilities and cable, 24-hour concierge and shuttle-bus service to local sites, and recreational facilities, such as a squash court, saltwater pool and terrace.
The Agent's Take : "Although this is not a new building, it was built during the years when quality was most important and that's very evident," agent Boris Kholodov said. "This was in move-in condition, which made it attractive to most purchasers who don't want to do any repairs or renovations before moving in."
But the proximity to water - in all its forms - was the real highlight. "It also has spectacular, unobstructed views of Lake Ontario and Toronto Islands," Mr. Kholodov added. "[Plus, the pool] is very attractive to many buyers."

Housing market defies forecasts

Author: Perkins, Tara

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/housing-market-defies-forecasts/docview/1543949288/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "Looking ahead to 2015, we expect house prices to track more closely to the rate of general economic growth," said Royal LePage CEO Phil Soper. "That is, we see price increases in Canada's largest cities moderating, just as our smaller city markets should see a lift."

Full text:   Most experts figured Canada's housing market would be showing signs of a slowdown by now. Instead, home construction and sales are up, raising questions about where the market is headed.
Construction on 198,185 units began last month on a seasonally adjusted annualized basis, according to figures released Wednesday by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. Most economists were forecasting around 190,000 housing starts.
"Low interest rates are adding more fuel to the housing market's tank," Toronto-Dominion Bank economic analyst Admir Kolaj wrote in a research note.
"Builders are clearly responding to the low interest rate environment and continued strong price growth in the existing home market."
Economists continue to project an eventual slowdown in the market, with a number of them saying we have been building too many homes of late.
"Many of Canada's biggest cities are already flush with condos for sale and still have a record number of units under construction, many of which will end up on the market once completed," Mr. Kolaj wrote.
"Over the medium term," said Mr. Kolaj, "we believe that overbuilding, along with gradually rising interest rates, will lead to a cooling in home price growth."
But, for now, record-low mortgage rates could continue to spur the market.
"The resiliency of the Canadian housing market has surprised expectations for a transition to lower, more sustainable levels and the latest monthly reading is no exception," Royal Bank of Canada economist Laura Cooper wrote in a research note. "Moreover, the recent outperformance of building permits and the persistence of lean mortgage rates provides upside risk for new housing demand to remain elevated in the near term."
The increasing popularity of condos, and pace of condo construction, has been one of the factors causing the actual number of housing starts to diverge from economists' estimates.
"Both single and multi-unit starts edged up slightly in June, but the bigger picture remains one of much higher levels of condo building in Canada's urban markets, by nearly a 2-to-1 margin," Bank of Montreal economist Robert Kavcic wrote in a research note.
Much of June's strength can be attributed to the especially strong market in Alberta, which is less worrisome, because "they need the houses," he added.
"Housing starts in the province saw a massive burst to 53,700 annualized units, a level topped only in a handful of months during the pre-recession housing boom in 2006/07."
"Meanwhile, activity cooled across much of the rest of the country in the month, including noteworthy declines in Quebec and Ontario."
The strong numbers come after the housing market had a particularly weak winter, due to unusually cold weather. Housing starts hit an annualized low of 157,000 in March, Bank of Nova Scotia economist Derek Holt noted.
"The strong numbers that we're seeing for Q2 are much more important than the weak numbers that we saw for Q1 and represent much more actual building," Mr. Holt said in a research note, pointing out that there is traditionally less new construction in winter months than at this time of year.
He added that looking through the volatility in some of the provincial numbers, the main theme is that housing construction levels have rebounded from a weak winter. That could give Canada's gross domestic product a lift for the second quarter.
It's not only construction that has rebounded. Full statistics on national sales and prices of existing homes for June will be released next week by the Canadian Real Estate Association. But preliminary data that is being released by local real estate boards across the country generally paints a picture of strength, especially in the highly populated markets of Toronto and Vancouver. May's sales topped the 10-year average for the month.
The comeback has been strong enough that TD's economics department upgraded its expectations last week for home sales and prices this year - although it continues to predict that "the Canadian housing market will cool over the medium term." On Wednesday, real estate firm Royal LePage boosted its forecast for average price growth this year.
Economists still expect the housing market's growth to peter out.
"We remain of the view that recent robust levels of housing starts are unlikely to be maintained over the second half of the year and into 2015," Ms. Cooper wrote. She's expecting new home construction to slow to 182,000 units for 2014 as a whole, down from 188,000 units last year.
"Looking ahead to 2015, we expect house prices to track more closely to the rate of general economic growth," said Royal LePage CEO Phil Soper. "That is, we see price increases in Canada's largest cities moderating, just as our smaller city markets should see a lift."

Full text:   Fireworks, harpists and culinary treats among the delights provided for guests of Fung-Tam wedding
It was no ordinary wedding. When Joseph Fung and Michelle Tam celebrated their marriage on Saturday in Vancouver at a black-tie ceremony capped by a fireworks extravaganza that lit up Coal Harbour, the 1,200 guests in attendance were witness to the city's social event of the summer - and quite possibly the decade.
"This is not just a wedding," said Thomas Fung, father of the groom, while twirling around the dance floor. "This is to introduce my business associates to my son, to show them that he's capable of helping me run the business." Mr. Fung Sr. is founder of the Fairchild Group, a media, real estate and franchise empire worth more than $400-million.
Born in Hong Kong, he is the eldest son of the late Fung King Hey, the legendary self-made billionaire who co-founded Sung Hung Kai Finance, the largest security brokerage firm in Asia.
Joseph Fung, who speaks seven languages, joined the family business several years ago, after working as a senior analyst for Morgan Stanley and PCCW, a communications technology company. Michelle Tam, a former fashion model, is working toward a law degree. They live in Hong Kong.
After a relatively intimate ceremony for 150 people at the newlyweds' local home, the wedding party arrived at the Vancouver Convention Centre, greeted by harpists and a lavish reception prepared by the Fairchild-sponsored Culinary Team Canada.
Ballroom tables were set with soaring centrepieces bursting with orchids and boxes of macarons (both father and son are avid bakers).
Distinguished guests included Vancouver and Richmond mayors Gregor Robertson and Malcolm Brodie and Chinese Consul-General Liu Fei. Guests from Hong Kong included member of legislative council Philip Wong, chairman of the trade development council Jack So and former minister of finance Frederick Ma, who is rumoured to be running for governor.
In a speech as startling for its candour as the wedding was spectacular, the father of the groom said he has always worried about his only child being born with a silver spoon in his mouth.
"I tried very hard not to raise a parasite content to live on the family fortune. ... Up to now, he never flew business class, never drove a fancy car, never stayed in five-star hotels or ate in Michelinstarred restaurants - unless I was hosting the dinner. Still, he has found life meaningful and fulfilling. Well, at least that's what he tells me."

Full text:   I still have my punk scars. A lump on my nose where it was broken one night outside of the Rotters Club in Ottawa in 1978, and a companion dent beneath my left eye. I earned them by running into the wrong people on Bank Street after enjoying a scorching performance by Hamilton's mighty Teenage Head. The perps had just spilled out of a hard rock/country joint called the Hitching Post, and they decided some punk ass - or, more accurately, university student wannabe punk ass - needed some righteous kicking. Sudden and unprovoked, it was over faster than a 1-2-3-4 count-in to a Ramones single.
Stuart Smith smiles when I tell him that story, then goes me several times better. He tells me about bomb threats he received after opening Rotters, Ottawa's pioneering punk venue, in that seminally noisy year of 1977. Death threats, too. The tires on his vehicle were slashed a total of 17 times. Rival club-owners weren't happy about this instantly successful punk upstart, and the local musicians' union took a dim view of the Rotters' cheeky policy of insisting bands play original music only, which ran directly counter to the bizarre, and thankfully long-gone dictum that only cover music could be performed in local live venues.
"Sometimes I'd park blocks from the club," Smith remembers, "but every time I'd go back they'd found it.
"I look back now and I know how much danger I was in," Smith says in the comfort of his home-studio cum condominium high above Toronto's Bay Street, "but at the time it didn't occur to me. I was just trying to have a good time with my friends, and not lose money. But it got scary and it soured the whole thing. So I came to Toronto, started working in commercial real estate, and never went back."
I'm sitting with Smith in his condo because the 61-year-old musician, early punk adopter and commercial real estate broker - he has placed more than 40 stores on Queen Street West alone, and sheepishly admits: "If anyone's responsible for what happened to Queen Street West, it's me" - has decided the time has come to go back. Back to Ottawa, to the late-seventies, to his short-lived clubs such as Rotters and 80s, and to one of the most concentrated, eclectic and fleeting episodes in Canadian music history. Largely because of Smith, a British-born immigrant who arrived in the capital at the age of 18 in 1970, Ottawa rocked back in the day. And he has the recordings to prove it.
"I feel like it's unfinished business," Smith says with a nod toward a stack of reel-to-reel tapes by his kitchen. "And now's the time to get it done."
What's the hurry? He says that if he leaves it too late, "some nephew will come down here, root through my stuff and chuck it all in the bin. And that's going to happen all over the world."
For the past several months, Smith and long-time musical coconspirator Carl Schultz have been painstakingly working their way through that stack of tapes.
At a rate of two days per track, they've remastered and digitized some 300 studio-quality tracks of Ottawa music that they recorded for the Double Helix production label when Rotters was raising such an unholy ruckus on Bank.
They're all here. Key local acts such as the Red Squares (art punk), The Action (glam punk) and the inevitably named Bureaucrats (meat-pie-and-potatoes Britpunk). Smith and Schultz recorded live off the board at his clubs, and also some skull-splitting early live covers done by Smith's proto-punk, psych-rock outfit Mickey Rat.
Smith plays me the remastered version of Rot n' Role , a 1980 compilation LP of Rotters regulars he'll be releasing later this year. The rollout of Ottawa alternative music is part of a Canadian punk revival that's been gathering momentum and volume in the past five or so years.
And it sounds astonishingly good: fresh, fun, smart and intense, and recorded with a professionalism that few scenes across the entire country enjoyed. If it finds its way to the right listeners - and at no time has interest in punk music been keener than right now - Rot n' Role might well stand as a resurrected classic of its era.
It began last week, as Smith and Schultz released MP3 singles of the Red Squares' Transmitter and Ottawa Today on July 1. That will be followed first by a launch of the remastered Rot n' Role CD in the fall and then by a proposed five-disc Double Helix compilation in time for Christmas.
And if Smith has his way, on it will go: He has albums' worth of recordings by most of the acts that contributed single tracks to the 1980 compilation. And there's enough live music to keep him and Schultz busy for some months yet.
It's a legacy project, the belated unearthing of a singular and nearly forgotten moment in Canadian music history.
It happened in Ottawa, and I've got the scars to prove it. So I have to ask: Why there and then?
"It's a phenomenon that happens when people get into groups and they're in isolated parts of a big city or in a small town," Smith says. "The Hacienda, CBGBs, the 100 Club. It's a bit more than a place you go to see a band. It's an artists' colony. And we had one of those in Ottawa. Maybe we didn't know it at the time, but I think back now and realize how amazingly lucky we were to experience it."

Abstract: Mr. [Richard Michaud], who is in charge of culture at the town council, says the region can continue to draw people with its stargazing and heritage.

Full text:   One year after the crash that killed 47 people and devastated its downtown, Lac-Megantic remains haunted by the tragedy - its residents caught between the impulse to stay and rebuild and the desire to move on
Christian Lafontaine moves through his day like a man in a hurry. He's a survivor and, between expanded responsibilities with his family's construction business and a onemonth-old baby at home, the 46-year-old seems always to be thinking about the next thing to do, the next place to be. It's as if, through constant motion, he can keep the past at bay.
Mr. Lafontaine and his wife, Melanie Gerard, were the last patrons to find their way out of the packed Musi-Café in LacMegantic after a hurtling train crashed into the small Quebec town last year, killing 47 people and laying waste to several downtown blocks. Afterward, Mr. Lafontaine memorialized the escape on his right bicep: The shoulderto-elbow tattoo shows the couple running away as flames engulf the café behind them; in the background lies the iconic Ste-Agnès church, surrounded by black tank cars thrown from the train.
He lost his brother, Gaetan Lafontaine, and Gaetan's wife, Joanie Turmel, along with several close friends. It was a dreadful intrusion on the life his family had built just outside Lac-Megantic, so entrenched that several residential streets bear his brothers' and father's first names.
Mr. Lafontaine says he has no plans to leave this picturesque region in Eastern Quebec, but he knows of others who have chosen to move, either out of frustration with the pace of reconstruction or because the memories of the accident are still too harrowing.
"Everyone has their reasons," he says. "Everyone has their ghosts."
One year after the horrific crash, Lac-Megantic remains haunted by a tragedy that has touched nearly everyone in town. There is no escaping the ghosts of the dead in a now deeply scarred place working to put itself back together, one halting project at a time. Some, like Mr. Lafontaine, appear to have reached a sense of peace with what happened, even as they mourn those they've lost. Others are fighting a barely concealed battle against flashbacks, nightmares and relentless grief.
Thus the strange psyche of this traumatized town of 6,000: caught between the impulse to stay and rebuild and the desire to move on - between fight and flight. Looming, too, are questions about the thing Lac-Megantic lost that seems most likely to return: the snaking trains laden with volatile crude oil that once rolled through the lakeside town.
Yannick Gagné stands by a steel skeleton on the edge of the new commercial district built adjacent to the shattered downtown. The owner of the Musi-Café, where more than half of the victims died on July 6, had planned to reopen the bar on a new site by the one-year anniversary. That reopening has now been delayed by months as he waits for financial aid long promised by governments in Ottawa and Quebec City.
When it eventually opens in September, the new Musi-Café will reflect the region that surrounds it, with furnishings rich in local wood and granite dug from the hills surrounding Lac-Megantic. Mr. Gagné worries that, without aid, he may have about $600,000 in debts before he can open the bar.
"That's a heavy burden," he says.
"We've had to fight to build this project and we aren't done yet. This isn't the same city any more - a lot is left to save, we've changed."
His staff has scattered across Quebec.
Karine Blanchette, an actress and waitress, now lives in Saint-Hyacinthe, near Montreal. She prefers not to talk about what happened last year.
The bar's former manager, Sophie L'Heureux, has also left the region in search of work. With a smile, Mr. Gagné says he'll convince her to come back once the bar has been rebuilt.
The railroad tracks run about a dozen metres west of the new Musi-Café construction site, the same distance as from the old bar.
When driving downhill toward the community's core, you now encounter a virtual trompe-l'oeil as the buildings on quaint Frontenac Street are still standing in the distance and appear unmolested, almost deceiving you into thinking the rebuilding is over. Cresting a hill, you see the storm fencing, and mountains of dirt rush into sight. The downtown is still walled off.
While some of the tall storm fencing brought in by Quebec provincial police last summer is gone, most has been moved back nearer to the Red Zone, as it's called, and the blackened rump of downtown. The black shroud that once hid the devastation from public view has been removed. The scar is now fully visible.
For many, the gash in the centre of town is a constant reminder of the tragedy and makes it more difficult to move on.
"We are grieving events that still aren't in the past, they are all around. In the normal process of grieving we regain the rhythm of life, however that rhythm is upended here. You see outside my window," says Father Steve Lemay, gesturing at the scene of devastation outside his Ste-Agnès Church office. "You see, it's the same for everyone, even the most banal of outings confronts us with grief."
'Inside, everything is moving'
A year ago, René Simard was smoking a cigarette on the terrace of the Musi-Café when the Montreal, Maine & Atlantic oil train careened into town. Many of the people closest to him were inside the bar, celebrating his friend Stephane Bolduc's birthday. Simard was an art teacher at the local high school for two decades, and most of the patrons were his students at some point.
Within moments he was running as the train derailed. He spotted his car parked nearby and ran toward it. The car exploded. He survived; his friends did not.
Now, most nights Mr. Simard sleeps on his couch, fully clothed, ready to run out of his house at any moment. He knows it sounds outrageous, but it helps him sleep.
Once clean-cut and conservatively dressed, he now wears a loose T-shirt and has grown a beard. He lives a Zen life, he explains inside his warmly decorated home.
Mr. Simard hasn't returned to work since the accident and has been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. His friends now come to see him at his home in Nantes, on the outskirts of Lac-Megantic. He lists his triggers: The orange lights on winter plows make his chest feel like it is being crushed; sirens are intolerable; sitting in the middle of restaurants causes panic attacks; he avoids being in crowds and tunes out the sound of yelling children.
Then there are the demons of night.
"I'm always having nightmares, terrible nightmares. I'm like a child when I wake up. I'm killing my mother, doing terrible things," he says. "This is crazy. I told my psychologist to lock me up in an iron jacket, but he told me that this is normal. A little girl was playing on her deck this morning and her screams made me go back to that evening, just talking about it makes my chest tighten.Her screams brought me back to the people I heard burn to death behind me."
In fact, hundreds of locals are experiencing cases of serious trauma. In trailers behind the city's hospital, 30 social workers are dealing with a deluge of new files. The number of locals seeking help increases weekly, along with the severity of the reported problems, according to town councillor André Desjardins.
On Oct. 31, a volunteer firefighter who worked at the town's largest employer, Tafisa, died by suicide. The young man killed himself after losing his girlfriend in the disaster and spending the first hectic days in the fiery downtown, helping unearth the bodies of some of his closest friends.
"A volcano is still burning in the population," says Tafisa CEO Louis Brassard, describing the man's struggle and the impact it has had on the factory floor.
When Mr. Simard first met with The Globe and Mail in October, the skin on his hands was red, deeply cracked and swollen. He now has deep red streaks on his face. "Stress," he says. "I look relaxed, but inside, everything is moving."
What worries the artist most is his loss of creativity. He's hung his art on his walls, but his past collages and paintings only seem to taunt him. The spark is gone. His impeccable French has also suffered and he now keeps a dictionary on his kitchen table.
To cope, he's resurrected the dreams of his childhood. "My parents didn't want me to have birds," he says, "so I bought birds." He now has five, most of them chatty parakeets.
He compares his grief to a set of Russian nesting dolls. Ten of his close friends were lost - too many to cope with collectively. Each death must be dealt with separately, each resolution leading to the next period of mourning.
In his closet, Mr. Simard keeps a mesh baseball cap that Mr. Bolduc used to wear when the two sailed on Megantic Lake.
"I won't wear the hat, I haven't even adjusted it in the back," he says. "It's an object that I treasure."
An exodus, real or imagined
Despite the trauma of the accident and the challenge of living in a town under constant reconstruction, many residents say their decision to stay was an easy one. Some cite their own families' roots here, others point to the tightly knit nature of the community or the stunning scenery of Quebec's Eastern Townships.
Sylvain Brier, the associate vice-principal at Lac-Megantic's high school, says that, because he only moved to LacMegantic in late 2012, he doesn't share the same history as some families in town. But, he adds, "It's a small place so when somebody leaves it makes a big mark, you know, leaves a big trail behind. And they have lived here all their lives."
Both the regional school board and the Lac-Megantic high school say there has been no notable decrease in the student body and, while the municipality confirms a population decline, it has refused to provide any numbers.
Even lacking proof, many in LacMegantic seem to feel that an exodus has started. Whether or not it is true - and many argue it isn't - the departure of a few has left others wondering whether they should follow and escape what could be a decade of painful reconstruction.
A review of real-estate listings shows a large number of houses on the market.
"There are a lot of homes that are for sale, an enormous number, maybe even more than last year," says local realestate agent Gina Dubé.
Ms. Dubé's face is plastered on signs around Lac-Megantic. She had a record year in 2013 as sales increased by 50 per cent following the disaster. "We were in a state of shock," she remembers.
Nearly 100 businesses and residents suddenly found themselves homeless.
While some would soon be allowed to return to their homes, much of the town's centre is still off-limits and slated for demolition.
Ghosts
Along with the evacuees, Ms. Dubé says many of her listings are from local couples who split up after the tragedy. "It forced many people to re-examine their lives and put things in perspective; it's sad, but many broke up," she says.
Ms. Dubé says others have simply left Lac-Megantic, although she hasn't collected a number. She also says very few new residents have arrived.
"New people will come. We're going to be a new city soon, that will entice people," she says. "What has happened is that Lac-Megantic has been discovered.
The city had always been considered the rough diamond of the Estrie [the French name for the Eastern Townships], now people have learned of it."
In the months following the tragedy, thousands of Quebeckers swarmed to the town to see the devastation. While derided by locals as "loiterers" and "lookie-loos," many have come back several times to enjoy the beauty of the area.
While the disaster has encouraged some residents to leave, the migration has been reversed for others. Frederike Simard, 22, is moving back to LacMegantic to be closer to her father and her fiancé's family.
"I almost lost my dad. That was a wake-up call, so I decided to move back and be near him," she says.
A hairdresser in Quebec City, she's emotional when describing the realization that her father escaped being a victim in Canada's deadliest modern rail disaster by only moments - and because he borrowed a cigarette.
Her fiancé, Sebastien Bolduc, is happy to join her in the move. A soldier in the Royal 22nd Regiment in Quebec City, the Van Doos, Mr. Bolduc was injured in Afghanistan and is ending his time in the military.
"My family is important, I just wanted to be closer," he says. He was the one with the dangerous job; he never expected his brother Stephane would die in the cozy Musi-Café, surrounded by friends.
The smell of oil
The disaster was disorienting for everyone. "The problem here is that people lost their points of reference and now their daily routines are gone," says Mr.
Desjardins, the town councillor. "They used to go for walks in the evening and have their coffees in the morning; that's all been disrupted."
On Kelly Street, the paint is fresh on Robert Dallaire's house. Only a few metres and a badly burned maple separate him from Veterans Park, where hundreds of thousands of litres of flaming oil flowed into Megantic Lake.
The retiree moved back into the house as soon as permitted and went to work repairing the damage. He and his family made it clear they had no plans to go anywhere.
"There was no question that we were staying," he says. He was away at the time of the disaster; many of his neighbours died while they slept.
When Mr. Dallaire's wife finally saw what was left of the street where they lived for 25 years, he says, she had a "crisis." She's been mute ever since, diagnosed with post-traumatic shock and slowly relearning to speak.
The smell of oil can be almost intolerable in their home. Angry at a lack of information from the town and the slow pace of redevelopment, the couple will be travelling Quebec in an RV this summer.
'A bitter taste'
Like many towns in rural Canada, LacMegantic is entwined with the railway that runs through it. Founded as Megantic in 1884, the town came into being just as the final stretch of the cross-Canada railway was constructed between Montreal and Atlantic Canada. It was renamed Lac-Megantic in 1958 for the lake it sits beside.
Without the railway, residents are certain that the town's biggest industrial employers would leave. But if the train comes back through town carrying oil - a real possibility after January, 2016 - others have declared they would choose to leave rather than live in fear of another tragedy.
"It's paradoxical," says Richard Michaud, a town councillor and longtime Lac-Megantic resident. "The town was built with the railway, and then the town had its biggest disaster with the railway. So it leaves a bitter taste."
The town's struggling economy has not made things any easier. One councillor estimates that roughly 300 people are collecting employment insurance benefits and a total of 800 jobs were lost.
For one group of local business owners, the tragedy represents an important opportunity for renewal. The group, called Groupe Action Megantic, is pressing for a new tourism plan aimed at capitalizing on the attention LacMegantic has received since last year.
The group has proposed building an Imax theatre and a 300-bed hotel, along with an interpretation centre that would describe Lac-Megantic's history, including the devastating rail accident.
Mr. Michaud, who is in charge of culture at the town council, says the region can continue to draw people with its stargazing and heritage. But when it comes to the old motto "From the railway to the Milky Way," he's certain that will change. "We'll do away with the railway, but we're sticking with our stars," he said. "No one's going to take those away."
'I cry every day'
Luc Dion and Julie Heon have been inseparable for the past year. Casual flirting on the terrace of the Musi-Café on July 6 turned into their first date. Then at 1:14 a.m. they were rocked as the oil train flew past.
As survivors, the couple say they have found strength in each other. Mr. Dion moved into Ms. Heon's house on July 1.
"I feel bad for the people who try to imagine how it was there, it seems like they are being hard on themselves when trying to understand," Ms. Heon says. "We were there, it was a stunning event that still wakes me up at night, but we're moving past it, we're dealing with it."
The couple say they have little interest in joining any official anniversary ceremonies. But when the Musi-Café reopens, they would like to return with the other survivors and raise a pint to the victims.
"We're constantly reliving that day," says Ms. Heon, whose best friend died inside the bar after leaving the couple alone on the terrace. "I'm sad, I cry every day and I don't need a ceremony to cry about it for three hours. I'm tired of crying."
Mr. Dion expresses anger at the "politicking" he blames for much of the delays and frustrations in town.
"This used to be a small village, now it's a very small village. It's all politicking, nothing has opened yet and promises were betrayed. The hands aren't following the words," Mr. Dion says.
He worries when he hears the warning bells of level crossings, reminding him of the last sounds he heard before the MM & A oil train crashed. Ms. Heon has had similar trouble.
"I don't hyperventilate or have a big panic," she says, "but it really stirs the emotions."
In the words of a four-year-old In early August, four-year-old édouard Pelletier will strap on his skates and head out on the ice. He'll probably be the youngest person at Lac-Megantic's arena as he starts his first session at the hockey school named after his father, Mathieu Pelletier.
A math teacher at the local high school, Mr. Pelletier was a hockey prospect who bowed out of a full scholarship at an American university to stay with Alexia Dumas-Chaput. On the night of July 5, he headed out to the Musi-Café with two friends. One was visiting from Quebec City, the other from Switzerland.
Ms. Dumas-Chaput woke up early July 6 to frantic texts looking for her husband. His body was found at the MusiCafé. Following the disaster, Lac-Megantic's hockey school was renamed after its founder.
This winter Ms. Dumas-Chaput skated with her son and gave him hockey lessons for the first time. With Mr. Pelletier's hockey sticks still in the garage, édouard is continuing a passion shared with his father.
"édouard doesn't really understand that the school is named after his father, but it makes me really emotional," Ms. Dumas-Chaput says. "I'm hesitating between being a typical mother in the stands or going down into the locker room and helping him dress up, which is what Mat would have done."
As she and her son adjust to a new routine, she says life has never returned to normal. "Even in my nicest days, when I can appreciate my time with édouard, there isn't a day that I forget what happened. I get up alone, I go to bed alone, I remember what happened," she says.
Mr. Pelletier's son has lasting questions about what happened to his father, and about whether anyone will be punished as a result. MM & A and three of its employees, including the engineer that night, are now facing 47 charges each of criminal negligence causing death.
édouard, Ms. Dumas-Chaput says, "has a four-year-old's sense of justice and he thinks bad behaviour requires a consequence. Like everyone else, he needs to feel that someone assumes responsibility for their errors. He might not have the right sense of proportionality, he figures that they will get a time-out or be forced to draw something - he doesn't understand prison time - but they need to take responsibility."
Running a new railway
Before the accident, regulators in Canada treated oil as relatively low-risk and enforced few rules for classifying crude.
Lac-Megantic prompted municipalities across North America to demand better information about what moves through their communities by rail, and Ottawa now requires shippers or importers to have detailed emergency-response plans in place before they can send crude oil, ethanol and several other highly flammable liquids. The changes are among a raft of new rules introduced in Canada and the United States after the accident exposed glaring gaps in the regulation of the rail industry.
Still, Mayor Colette Roy-Laroche says she will continue to press for a rail bypass around Lac-Megantic to ensure that hazardous goods are no longer ferried down a steep slope into town. So far, she's received no assurances from either level of government and doesn't expect to until they know how much it will cost.
The new rail company that has taken over the MM & A's network has been under intense scrutiny at town meetings and in the local press.
At a public meeting with the Central Maine and Quebec Railway in late May, the CEO of the largest employer in town was the last at the microphone.
"I told them that they will need to run a safe operation, the population will be watching," Mr. Brassard says. "In French I told him: Il faut que les bottines suivent les babines . You need to walk the talk.
The room laughed, but it's our responsibility as a customer to deal with a business partner that shares our values."
He says he was satisfied with the veteran operators that look poised to run the new railroad.
However, the distinction between MM & A and CM & Q is belied by the fact that the new company, which just received permission to operate in Canada, is employing many managers who have come directly from the previous railroad. Four senior managers from MM & A are with the CM & Q on contract, while others have been hired into permanent management positions. The trustee for MM & A, Bob Keach, would not say which four were on contract.
A review of the new company's phone directory lists MM & A's former CEO, Bob Grindrod, as employed by CM & Q.
MM & A's former heads of human resources, marketing, transportation practices, budgeting, engineering, real estate and environmental affairs are all listed on the CM & Q directory.
'Live life at its fullest'
Mr. Brier, at the high school, says he senses some concern among students about their future in the town. "We can feel that they are worried and asking themselves a lot of questions: Should I stay or should I go?" he says. Many have consulted the school's guidance councillor.
Enrolment in extracurricular sports programs increased by at least 30 per cent last year, filling the gym from the end of the school day until 10 p.m. every weeknight. The accident left LacMegantic's children with few places to hang out.
The adults have their own questions - and some residents strike a mystical note. Whether for a laugh or for advice, Mr. Simard speaks daily with his friends who died. While the memorial candles crowd his credenza, he says the ghosts of his friends are there for assistance. "I never believed this before, but they are still here looking over us," he says.
Mr. Lafontaine's wife, Melanie, gave birth in the spring to a little girl named élodie. Mr. Lafontaine muses that the child could be a way for those who died in the accident to return, and then quickly dismisses the notion. But, he adds, "You know, my brother Gaetan knew we wanted to have another child, so maybe he's the one who sent her to us."
Lac-Megantic's dead are still remembered, even before their names are inscribed on a planned memorial. Their presence is still felt around town, coddling friends on disquieting nights and providing a new appreciation for what hasn't been lost.
"This isn't just dark and drab," Mr. Lafontaine says. "I've been given a chance, why would I waste it? I'm going to live life at its fullest. We're all going to die, we all know that, so why not enjoy life while we can?" .

Full text:   Building a cabin without formal plans - and with helping hands of friends and family - was a labour of love for an architect couple
Susan and David Scott are architects who like to get their hands dirty. They want to create things. Build things. They want to work in response to their surroundings and the materials available.
Nothing expresses this point of view quite as much as their award-winning Vancouver Island alpine cabin, built above the treeline on Mount Cain.
"We wanted to go out and just make something," David says of the 1,000-square-foot structure, which was built without any formal plans.
This impulse to go rogue had been around since the couple's time studying architecture in Halifax, a program that instilled into its students the notion of actually making their designs.
"And we had been working on projects where we had multiple hundreds of drawings ... binders and binders of specifications. Part of doing this was a reaction to that," he says.
In 2005, they entered a land lottery on the community-run, notfor-profit ski hill in the north of Vancouver Island, and found themselves with a lot for $20,000.
With a few rules required by Mount Cain Alpine Park - no machine excavation, natural colours only, building out from a centre point, rather than within boundary lines - the Scotts started looking for help.
"We sent e-mails: 'Seeking people willing to work for powder,' "David says with a laugh.
And they came: friends, family, engineers, architects, "and some people who had no idea what they were doing with power tools," Susan says. "It was such a random group of people - it was really fun."
True to the couple's selfimposed strictures, the build itself came together as a response to the materials around them.
Initially, they were tempted by the thought of using telegraph poles from a local manufacturing plant, but those weren't available.
"But then we found this guy - a sawyer - who basically just gave us trees," Susan recalls.
A friend helping out had built a place on Passage Island and had become very comfortable using high rigging with cables and chainsaw winches, so, David says, it seemed quite logical to take these 40-foot poles and winch them up.
"Everybody thought we were crazy," David says. "It looked as if we were creating this bushleague Cirque du Soleil - at one point there were six columns in the air all tied up with ropes - hundreds and hundreds of feet of rope."
But there was method to their madness: The area is known to get extremely windy, and the big poles provide a lot of bending strength.
"Some of those cabins up there, you can see the chandeliers swing," Susan adds.
The Scotts' cabin, which won an A+ award in the self-initiated projects category of the 2014 Architizer Awards, was built largely from fir - local, plentiful and cheap. The exterior was clad in cedar, which arrived with a pile of extra thin strips as dunnage.
"We were wondering what to make the sauna from," Susan recalls. "And then we saw all these strips of cedar and decided to make it like a mini log cabin. It looks great," she says, before adding, with a sigh: "But it took absolutely forever."
For a cabin, it's a substantial space - with two bedrooms and a den upstairs and a living space, kitchen and toilet on the main floor, as well as the sauna - but hardly luxurious by modern standards.
There is no electricity and no running water; reaching the cabin in the winter involves a hike in with all provisions - including drinking water.
Other cabin-dwellers in the area have snowmobiles for transport, but the Scotts are hard-core, pulling everything up on a huge sled - with their two small children sitting on top.
The simplicity of the cabin has, they think, made it look achievable to others.
"There are a lot of reasons young people don't just go and build cabins the way they used to in the Gulf Islands," David says.
"A lot of it is real estate and money and time."
"We had a very, very small budget," Susan adds, noting it cost them about $100,000 - albeit with no labour costs. She estimates that number would have tripled if they hadn't built it themselves.
Since building the cabin, the Scotts have given up their jobs to raise their kids and renovate their Main Street, Vancouver, house at the same time.
They worked out the cost of child care and hiring contractors, and figured it was about the same as quitting, picking up the power tools and renovating with their daughters about their feet.
The final stage in the renovations was creating their homestudio space, clad with fir and lovingly finished with a mixture of beeswax and whisky. In it, they opened their own practice, Scott & Scott Architects, a year ago.
"It may be a puritan vision of the world," David says. "But we want our kids to see us working, and to understand how things are made."

Abstract: Mr. [Richard Ballenthin] has never regretted his move, though. He says dealing with commercial tenants is far easier than screening residential tenants. His renters - an accounting firm and a store - take care of minor maintenance themselves and pay the rent reliably. While one of his spaces was vacant for two months, he's had few problems finding good tenants.

Full text:   The potential risks are obvious, but as one Ontario investor discovered, there is a significant potential for a healthy return
imcgugan@globeandmail.com
Tenants, anyone?
When pondering how to produce an income in retirement, people tend to fixate on stocks, bonds and mutual funds.
Rarely mentioned is one other option: becoming a landlord.
Many people rule out the possibility because they don't want to spend their golden years dealing with rowdy renters and peeling paint. But, under the right circumstances, it may pay to reconsider.
Richard Ballenthin, a retired Lutheran clergyman, sold his house a year and a half ago and bought a small commercial building in Durham, Ont., about 45 minutes south of Owen Sound.
Today, at 71, he lives in a spacious apartment in the building and rents out two small retail spaces.
He figures the move has boosted his retirement income by about 40 per cent.
"This can work well for someone who is prepared to downsize and has been debating a move to a condo or apartment," he says.
"It has certainly worked out far better than I ever expected."
To find out whether a similar move may make sense for you, it's important to have a realistic view of the pros and cons of property investment.
At its best, a rental property can throw off cash, much like an annuity, guaranteeing you a lifelong source of income. Better yet, the amount of that income will tend to rise with inflation since rents usually go up in tandem with prices.
The downside? Owning a rental property can leave you exposed to a downturn in the local economy. Go a few months without a tenant and the financial pain can be severe.
The only thing worse than having no tenant is having a bad tenant. If an occupant is particularly unruly, you may be forced to go to court to evict him.
Even with a good tenant, you have to be prepared for the regular grind of maintenance work.
Especially as you enter your seventies, you may not want to shovel snow or fix clogged toilets.
For all those reasons, most seniors who want to derive income from the property market should look first at real estate investment trusts, or REITs. Buy units in a REIT and you receive regular payouts from a diversified, professionally managed portfolio of properties, without the hassles of actually dealing with tenants yourself.
But don't automatically dismiss the notion of buying a rental property yourself. It all comes down to the specifics of the situation.
Becoming a landlord can be particularly attractive if you're thinking of downsizing anyway.
In that case, swapping a large home for a property with smaller living space and a rental unit can allow you to both trim maintenance expenses and generate income.
Caution is important. Since retirement is not a time to take financial gambles, you want to find a property that you can buy without going into debt.
You should be confident that it will generate a healthy return based on the cash it is generating right now, after accounting for all expenses. Sure, it's possible that the property will be worth more than you paid for it at some point, but you shouldn't factor such uncertain future gains into your buying equation, especially since some observers believe property prices are headed down, rather than up, in the years ahead.
Right now, some of the best values for downsizing homeowners appear to lie in small commercial buildings that are too tiny to appeal to a REIT, and that also contain a living space for a landlord.
Mr. Ballenthin says he stumbled into buying such a building largely by accident. After his kids reached adulthood, he sold his two-storey house and decided to purchase his current property because his daughter was thinking of opening a store. She later changed her mind, but by that point the deal was done.
Mr. Ballenthin has never regretted his move, though. He says dealing with commercial tenants is far easier than screening residential tenants. His renters - an accounting firm and a store - take care of minor maintenance themselves and pay the rent reliably. While one of his spaces was vacant for two months, he's had few problems finding good tenants.
To Mr. Ballenthin's delight, he has also found that his maintenance costs are far lower than they would be if he stayed in a house. Since his building sits between similar structures on both sides, he has only two exterior walls and a roof to worry about.
And he can write off a portion of his property taxes, utilities and insurance fees as a business expense.
He calculates that his building produces as much income as a conservatively invested portfolio of $750,000 - but he paid far, far less than $750,000 for it.
"Until two years ago I never considered going this route but the income generated [while] all the while retaining ownership of the property is unbeatable," he says.

Full text:   Architect Paul Raff sought to maximize natural light in a subtle way for the North Toronto residence aptly named Counterpoint House
jmays@globeandmail.com
As local architectural history goes, the rapid build-out of the old town of North Toronto after annexation by the city in 1912 left a legacy of mixed blessings in its wake.
On one hand, the transformation of the district from farmland into a streetcar suburb created the many comfortably conservative single-family houses that have always attracted well-off (but not grand) members of the middle class. North Toronto has good schools, well-rooted church and civic communities, and numerous streetscapes that speak eloquently of traditional social and cultural values.
Like countless others put up elsewhere in Toronto before yesterday, however, the houses in this area tend to be dark on the inside and, until renovated, closed off from the garden at the rear. So if you want to live in North Toronto - there are several excellent reasons to do so - and also want to enjoy all the light that's available from Hogtown's various skies and appreciate contemporary architectural expressions, you may well be thinking of building your residence from scratch.
Such was the process of thought that prompted an academic researcher and his wife, both former bankers, to scour the Internet for the names of upto-speed designers, and eventually to become the clients of Toronto architect and artist Paul Raff. The thoughtful, 2,500square-foot result of Mr. Raff's well-focused intervention in North Toronto is called Counterpoint House - an apt name, as it turns out, since the composition is a disciplined harmonic whole fashioned from closely rhyming elements.
Here, as elsewhere in Mr. Raff's work, all these customized elements - horizontal and vertical windows, doors, glass walls, the openings between spaces within - are responses to the qualities of light peculiar to Toronto's latitude, and to the south-facing orientation of the flat-roofed house itself.
In order to invite maximum illumination into the centre of the building, for example, the architect has pushed the broadwindowed study to the streetside façade of the entrance level and pulled back the second-storey volume from off the top of the study and entry hall. He has then carved a horizontal window, almost as wide as the dwelling, in the façade of the pulled-back portion. Light penetrates deep into the interior, without resorting to skylights.
Which, of course, could be a problem for the residents of a Toronto house that opens so generously toward the south.
The low winter sunshine here is harsh, unforgiving; and though natural light is softer and higher in summer, the glare might still be punishing. Mr. Raff's solution has involved his design and fabrication of a gauzy aluminum veil to cover the whole expanse of the big clerestory window and the upper-storey openings in the façade - dense enough to shield the interior from hard radiance, but porous and reflective enough to let the living room and kitchen below be showered by light, even on overcast days.
The brightness is also moderated and shaped by the forms Mr. Raff has given to the inside spaces. Instead of being spread out over so much undifferentiated territory, the various components of the main level's open plan have been gathered together and defined carefully.
The sparsely furnished living room, the first area the visitor enters after coming through the spacious entryway, for instance, is almost 16 feet tall, The reason for raising the ceiling so high, the architect said, is to take it right out of peripheral vision, making the living room seem to have no lid at all. In contrast to that expansiveness, the ceiling of the kitchen and dining zone is a more intimate, but still formally imposing, 11 feet off the floor. A wall of glass admits gentle north light to the dining area, separating it from the garden beyond.
As perhaps befits a contemporary residential project dropped into an old-fashioned interwar neighbourhood, this home makes no fuss about itself. Rather, it modestly retires from the street behind its surfacing of grey basalt tile and its tall, silvery aluminum screen - maybe a little too modestly. But if exterior animation is wanted, one finds it at the entrance, where the pale concrete steps and an inward angling of the sombre tile draw the eye toward the handsomely tall, slender wooden front door.
Counterpoint House is contemporary residential architecture in one of its most subtle registers. Mr. Raff's play with solids and voids, with openings and shuttings, and his shifts of tone and atmosphere, are deft, assured, never noisy. The dwelling works well on the quiet street in old North Toronto for which it was designed.

SELLING PRICE $475,000

DAYS ON THE MARKET Six
LISTING AGENT Frank Lardi, Brad J. Lamb Realty Inc.
The Action : In the brand new King East building in the Furniture District, units with one bedroom and a den tend to move more quickly than larger two-bedroom suites. So this onebedroom plus den unit was scooped up within days this spring.
What They Got : Local realtor and developer Brad Lamb designed a modern building with upscale details, like those in this roughly 790-square-foot unit with floor-to-ceiling windows, exposed concrete ceilings, hardwood floors, stone counters and stainless steel appliances.
The layout is open concept with areas for a den and living and dining area against sliding doors to a 126-square-foot balcony.
A kitchen, two full bathrooms and laundry facilities complete the wet stations of this suite, which also has parking and monthly fees of $500 for water, concierge, meeting, event and guest rooms.
The Agent's Take : "It's a very attractive looking building," says agent Frank Lardi.
"It's in a neighbourhood that's popular today, but still up-andcoming, so there's a lot of room to see growth in equity over time: The Globe and Mail head office is going up very close by and there are several new condo projects going in, including the Canary District."
The developer is also known to favour high-quality form and function as standards. "The layout is very strong and very usable - there's a large living and dining space, which people gravitate towards," Mr. Lardi notes.
"And it has two bathrooms, which is unusual for a onebedroom plus den, and it has a large balcony with a gas line, which is also unusual in condos since only a select number of buildings in the city offer that."

Abstract: During the 1980s and early '90s, Colombian soccer became a battleground between the country's most powerful crimelords. Officials were either bought off or cowed. Referee Alvaro Ortega was murdered in the street several days after making a call that cost Nacional a win.

On July 2, a week after his own goal had cost Colombia a chance to advance into the knockout rounds of the 1994 World Cup, a group of men approached team captain Andres Escobar outside a Medellin nightclub.
An argument that had started inside now escalated. Someone pulled a gun and began shooting. They pumped six bullets into him.
According to his fiancee, after each shot, one of the assailants yelled, "Gooooaaalll."
It's never been clear if Escobar was killed on impulse or assassinated. The only man convicted of the crime - the bodyguard for a pair of local drug dealers - repeatedly changed his story.
Escobar's murder was a tipping point. It destroyed Colombian soccer. Twenty years on, it's only begun to recover here in Brazil.
There is no greater or more cliched way to express the elemental link between fans and their teams than to tie them together in death.
After Uruguay beat Brazil in the 1950 World Cup final at the Maracana, contemporary reports had local supporters jumping to their deaths inside the stadium. There is no record of their names.
Nevertheless, it's a feature of any retelling of the Maracanazo. Did it happen? Who knows. These examples have nothing to do with real people. The victims are emblematic of the larger point - how much the game meant. They killed themselves for it.
Escobar's death was different. It had a face. The whole world had seen the replay of his terrible error. He'd written an article of apology afterward, and concluded it with the line, "Life doesn't end here."
This death had the opposite effect - it made the game trivial.
The crime gripped the world's imagination, but it was a final insult for Colombians. They were by this point inured to the link between soccer and violence, but this was too much.
At the height of the coke trade, before Pablo Escobar was chased out of his aunt's house in 1993 and shot on a rooftop, before Colombia's cartels were pulled apart in a campaign of legal murder, the preferred toys of the narcotraficantes were soccer clubs.
The other Escobar, history's most famed drug kingpin, was a sort of psychopathic Robin Hood.
He built vast estates for Medellin's poor, and then set his child assassins into them to take target practice. They used the method Escobar had pioneered as a teenage hitman - two men, back-toback on a motorcycle, the rearward-facing one spraying machine-gun fire.
Pablo Escobar had many interests, but soccer was his fixation.
He controlled the hometown team, Atletico Nacional, behind a series of fronts. It was both a plaything and a money-laundering operation. He was buried wrapped in a Nacional flag.
During the 1980s and early '90s, Colombian soccer became a battleground between the country's most powerful crimelords. Officials were either bought off or cowed. Referee Alvaro Ortega was murdered in the street several days after making a call that cost Nacional a win. When the country's justice minister pointed out in 1983 what everyone already knew - that drug lords owned most of the country's first division - he was killed as well.
This culture of death overwhelmed an entire country, and infected all its institutions. The only one it improved was soccer.
Suddenly, there was unlimited money to spend on players and managers.
Having never before done anything of consequence, Nacional lifted a Copa Libertadores - the South American Champions League. Andres Escobar scored the first penalty in the shootout that won it.
In life, the two unrelated Escobars were said to have been cordial, though never friendly. (In death, it was said that if Pablo had been alive, he would not have allowed Andres to be killed.)
Propped up by drug money, the national team was now concentrated in two professional clubs - Nacional and America Cali (of the Cali cartel). A golden generation began to form and cohere. At the 1994 World Cup, Colombia was the fourth-ranked side in the world. Pele had predicted it would win.
Then it went sideways on the field, and right into the ditch off it. Many of the best internationals quit in despair.
Escobar's murder leant popular support to an ongoing campaign to cleanse Colombia of the cartels, by any means necessary.
Coke went out of fashion. The drug business moved further north, closer to its primary market. Colombia's crime problem didn't disappear, but the drug lords lost their place at the head of society.
Without their money, Colombian soccer collapsed, at home and abroad.
It's taken two decades to rebuild. On Friday, Colombia will play Brazil in its first ever World Cup quarter-final.
Escobar's family will be in attendance. His siblings spoke to FIFA's website pre-tournament to remind people why they're here.
"People should enjoy football with passion, but never forgetting it's a game."
It's a wonderful sentiment.
Thanks to the complexities of human nature, it will never be entirely true.

The things I do for you people.
While the rest of you were dipping a toe into summer, I plunged headfirst into the new report on the future of the CBC, A Space For Us All, so you wouldn't have to.
I was hoping that report might be called The Miracle Of The Loaves And The Fishes, given its promise to do a lot more with a lot less. Apparently that title isn't compatible with a digital-focused future, since it brings to mind the wrong kind of tablet.
The report is, shall we say, unwieldy in its use of jargon, and densely forested with word thickets where management likes to hide the bodies. I understand the need for this strategy: A report that consists only of the word "Aieeeeeee" accompanied by a screaming face is likely to frighten the locals.
Anyway, there I was, prepared to drill down and pick some lowhanging fruit, to circle back on the disruptive technologies that will provide platform-agnostic synergies for the future. Even as CBC president Hubert Lacroix was addressing his understandably cranky troops about how their future lives in a cellphone and not in news reporting, I had my highlighter out with the report, translating its contents for you, gentle readers - who are also listeners, and viewers. And if I had to lie down later with a dose of Dr. Renzetti's Magical Elixir for the Relief of Management-Speak, well, that's a price I'm willing to pay.
Here's what it says:
The report : CBC/Radio-Canada must "lighten its technology and real-estate footprint across the country, focusing efforts and resources on content rather than infrastructure."
My translation : Does anyone want to buy a very large red and white building with Jian Ghomeshi's face on it? Close to shopping and the subway.
Report: "Local service is at the heart of the public broadcaster's role and remains a top priority for audiences. Local news, in particular, is prized by Canadians. A space for us all reaffirms the importance of a regional presence across the country and commits to being even more local than today, but at less cost."
Translation: We plan to produce just as much local news with fewer staff, for less money. A job posting will soon go up for shamans, alchemists, magicians and grifters who have ideas on how this might be accomplished.
(These are non-union positions.)
Report : "CBC/Radio-Canada will identify important target segments, and be intentional about the specific purpose of each service for the respective segment.
The focus is to engage target segments intensely with some, but not all, services; to engage Canadians in the public space in a way that is meaningful and personal to the individual."
Translation : Okay, I was stumped by this for a bit, but I think it means that news about birds and books and other things of interest to old people will continue to be found on radio at 6 a.m., while the rest of you can play the latest game about Drake's pants on your iPhones. Could be wrong, though.
Report: "Prime-time entertainment titles are the biggest drivers of audience and revenue on conventional television. These titles are the most powerful vectors of culture ..."
Translation : Prepare for a reality show about the cutthroat world of competitive curling called Get Your Rocks Off, and also Dragon's Playpen, in which toddlers choose the toys best aligned with their corporate objectives.
Report : "Documentaries will include bold, thought-provoking, point-of-view programs reflecting the most relevant issues to Canadians."
Translation : As long as we don't have to make them.
Report : "Scripted comedies will be cutting edge, with characterled focus rather than traditional 'sitcom' formats."
Translation : We will run a continuous feed of Rob Ford's press conferences, with guest appearances by the "brother" character and the "shady" character(s).
Report : "Letting go of the infrastructure, systems and processes that are less necessary in today's world, and embracing flexibility, scalability, agility, simplicity and partnership."
Translation : Honest to God, I have no idea what this means.
But I am willing to accept guesses, and the most entertaining will receive a copy of Knowlton Nash's memoir, which does not contain a single mention of "scalability."
Report : "The corporation's work force must also continue to reflect the Canadian population.
The average age of CBC/RadioCanada's work force is 45 years, with 13 years of seniority - over 20 per cent of employees are eligible to retire between now and 2018. The number of accredited unions with different working conditions also adds complexity.
As well, there is a higher rate of turnover with the younger work force. Being able to attract, retain and engage diverse talent with the necessary skills for the future will be key to long-term success."
Translation : Middle-aged employees, the ice floes are this way. Yes, you can bring your microphones. Young employees, the two-day contracts are here for you to sign. No, that coffee is not for you.
Well, I hope that was a useful exercise. I'll be back here in six years to explain the public broadcaster's next report, A Space For Us All (Where The CBC Used To Be).

The Cotswolds cure

Author: Schneller, Johanna

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/cotswolds-cure/docview/1540933753/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: We go to the nutty little Mill Dene Garden in Blockley, which bills itself as "the essence of the Cotswolds." We go to the elegant Bourton House Garden in Bourton-on-the-Hill, where deep purple flowers are the trend, the lawn is so lush it feels like walking on a mattress and three gardeners in matching black macintoshes weed the topiary in the rain. We go to the Falconry Centre down the road.

Full text:   Drunk on colour and stoned on scent, Johanna Schneller spends four days walking among the ancestral homes and mind-blowing gardens in one of England's most picturesque regions
I'm sitting on a bench in the Hidcote Manor Garden in Chipping Campden, England, on the last day of a ramble through the Cotswolds with my husband and two other couples. We've all been friends for decades. The sun is shining, after a day and a half of rain.
The garden, a passion project of its former owner, Major Lawrence Johnston, is the densest display of flowers I've ever seen, acres of garden "rooms" that flow into one another, any one of which - the white garden, the poppy garden, the alpine terrace, the bulb slope, the beech allee - would be dazzling on its own. Vita Sackville-West (no slouch in her own gardens, at Sissinghurst) called Hidcote "a jungle of beauty; a jungle controlled by a single mind," and on this May day, there are so many blossoms, such intense fragrance, and so much teeming life - bees buzzing, sheep bleating, birds singing, pheasants strutting, hawks circling - that a sob suddenly rises in my chest, and before I know it I am weeping.
I didn't expect this when I'd signed on for four days of walking, eating and garden touring in the Cotswolds, the 145-kilometre swath of pastoral perfection that stretches from Stratford-upon-Avon to Bath. (If England were a face, the Cotswolds would be one of its cheekbones.) Designated an "area of outstanding natural beauty" in 1966, the region is currently an escape for moneyed Londoners, but it's been prosperous since the Middle Ages, when it was the heart of the wool trade. It sits on a seam of Jurassic-era oolitic limestone, gorgeous honey-colored blocks which make up nearly every building in the pristine villages. (The colour comes from fossilized sea urchins.) Virginia Woolf was a regular visitor. Gustav Holst named a symphony after the place.
We were staying at Buckland Manor in Broadway, an ancient pile that was acquired after the dissolution of the monasteries in 1536 by a Lord Mayor of London, and is now a Relais & Châteaux hotel with three sitting rooms, mullioned windows, a croquet lawn, a staff that comes out to greet you every time you walk up the driveway, and a selection of classic Aston Martins and Bentleys available to rent. (The manor also has access to a fleet of twin-engine helicopters, should James Bond be staying. I'm just glad I didn't know the room rate until we checked out.)
Drinking fresh mint tea in front of a fire on our first night, I pick up a book about Mary Delany, who'd moved into Buckland with her family in 1715. She would go on to become a renowned letter-writer and a friend of Handel, Swift and King George III.
But first she was married (for money) at 17 to a sloppy, snuff-addled 59-year-old, whom she called in her diary "altogether a person rather disgusting than engaging." At the age of 72, she found her calling: She began making collages of dried flowers, which she called "mosaicks." Over the next 10 years she made 1,000 of them, many of which are now in the British Museum. Though she is the first flower-addled eccentric I encounter on this trip, she will not be the last.
Every morning, we meet for breakfast in Buckland's dining room (orange-yoked eggs; whisky in the oatmeal), then set off across sheep fields on routes mapped out for us by our trip planner, the Wayfarers. Some of the paths are well-trod and clearly marked, with romantic-sounding names (Heart of England Way, Monarch Way and the Cotswolds Way, a 164-kilometre-long trail that follows the spine of the region); others are merely flattened grass suggestive of paths.
We tramp from field to field, among sheep shorn or shaggy, with young lambs everywhere. We baa at them, they baa back. I didn't realize my friends knew so many sheep jokes.
The lilacs are in bloom. The roses are in bloom. The hawthorns are crazy with blooms, and their white-and-pink fragrance hangs in the air. At the Mount Inn, we eat a ploughman's lunch served on planks at an outdoor picnic table overlooking the gem-like village of Stanton. At the Horse and Groom pub in Bourton on the Hill, we eat mushroom soup and salmon, and are invited to dry our wet boots by the fire. (We end up drying them on the blowers in the ladies' loo.) In Chipping Camden, we eat sticky toffee pudding at Eight Bells, a slant-ceilinged pub that was built in the 14th century to house church bells.
After lunch, we visit a house or garden. One of these, Stanway House, was owned by Tewkesbury Abbey for its first 800 years; for the past 500 it's belonged to the Tracy family. Its current occupant, the 13th Earl of Wemyss (pronounced Weems), is not in attendance - he's skipped town to make room for a BBC film crew, who are here shooting the miniseries Wolf Hall , based on Hilary Mantel's bestseller, starring Mark Rylance as Cromwell. (Prop people haul in boxes of furs and jewelled velvet, and hang movie tapestries over the real, 18th-century Flemish tapestries. The next night in Broadway, we see Rylance himself, taking a stroll in a pink baseball cap.)
But though we don't meet Wemyss, as he calls himself, we feel like we do. Photos of him, looking rougish, litter the tabletops: at the age of 11, dressed in a pageboy's breeches, holding the Queen Mum's train; in his 40s, grinning on a camel. His two-page family tree begins in 640, and includes Charlemagne (768), Aethelred the Unready and William the Conquerer. The first de Tracey, who shows up in 1170, may have participated in the murder of Thomas Becket.
The earl ignores the threadbare rugs, cracked ceilings and waterstained walls, and busies himself with things he likes - he revived the property's 18th-century cider press, and restored a gravity fountain that now shoots the tallest plume in England, 91 metres on a still day. The house contains, among many things, a springloaded exercise chair designed by Thomas Chippendale; William Morris tulip wallpaper hung by Morris himself; charcoal drawings of Wemyss's grandparents done by John Singer Sargent in 1911; and a priceless collection of china painted with herb botanicals that the Queen Mum coveted.
Wemyss's eccentricities, however, pale beside those of Charles Pagett Wade, who owned Snowshill Manor, which we visit the next day. The house dates from 821, and was given by Henry VIII to Catherine Parr. Wade, an architect whose fortune came from West Indies sugar plantations, amassed an enormous collection of hand-made artifacts, and wanted a place to display them. He bought the house in ruins in 1919, restored it and in 1951 donated it to the National Trust.
What crazy collections they are: room after room, 22,000 items, none of them labelled. "So you've got to just enjoy looking at what you enjoy," one of the many volunteer guides says. One cabinet holds nothing but little cloth shoes. The Green Room contains 26 suits of samurai armour. Visitors to Snowshill, including John Betjeman, Graham Greene and J.B. Priestley, dressed up in the 2,000-piece costume collection and did amateur dramatics.
There's a collection of wooden boxes, which rests on the canopies of a collection of canopy beds. There's a collection of ink drawings on playing cards, and another (my favourite) of dollhouse-size spinning wheels and dominoes, carved out of dinner bones by French prisoners.
We learn that Wade - who in photographs looks like a rakish Ian McKellen, with a pipe in his teeth and hair curling around his ears - never lived in the manor house; he lived in the adjacent priest's house, a squat dark box with no electricity and a commode with a drawer for emptying.
A "bachelor" until he fell ill at 64, Wade then married a local caregiver - but continued to sleep in his single wooden box bed, while his wife slept in a separate box, in a separate room, behind a locked door. "There were no children," a guide says dryly. No kidding.
We also learn that the name of the house was once pronounced "Snozzle." Though we are six responsible adults, we become snorting eight-year-olds, and spend the rest of our trip composing raunchy odes built around "snozzle" - noun or verb, equally funny.
We go to the nutty little Mill Dene Garden in Blockley, which bills itself as "the essence of the Cotswolds." We go to the elegant Bourton House Garden in Bourton-on-the-Hill, where deep purple flowers are the trend, the lawn is so lush it feels like walking on a mattress and three gardeners in matching black macintoshes weed the topiary in the rain. We go to the Falconry Centre down the road. The falcons won't fly in rain, but we take turns holding an enormous owl on our gloved hands. "Their eyesight is rubbish," their keeper tells us, "but they can hear a mouse's heart beating from high in the sky." Our last day of touring commences at Kiftsgate Court Gardens, the home of the largest rosebush in Britain, and the creation of "three generations of lady gardeners" - Heather Muir in the 1920s, her daughter Diany Binny in the 1950s and her daughter Anne Chambers beginning in the 1980s. Chambers and her husband, preternaturally hale 60somethings in tweeds and enormous Wellies, happen to be here, taking friends on a tour of the multitiered acres. Standing by the swimming pool on the lower tier, overlooking more fields of sheep, I overhear Chambers say, "Mum planted these trees to block out the village," as she sweeps her arm past a forest.
The sun breaks through the clouds as we cross the road to Hidcote, which has been run by the National Trust since 1947, and is doing all it can to exploit the big-bucks garden-tourism craze.
Buses pull in and out, and workmen are setting up the screen for a "movie under the stars" night (they're showing Grease, complete with a Danny and Sandy costume contest).
Hidcote's former owner, Johnston, was an American raised in England and a veteran of the Boer War. His family bought the place in 1907 and he spent the next 30 years travelling the world to find plants. The gardens are so vast that I immediately lose my friends. After an hour, I'm drunk with colour, stoned on scent. I collapse onto a bench, overwhelmed by the sheer mass of life around me, and the herculean, hugely generous effort to increase its beauty by bringing order to wildness. The longer I sit there, the more grateful I feel: to Major Lawrence. To all gardeners. To my friends, whom I've loved half my life, and who've had their share of birthdays, health scares and setbacks, but who'd rather laugh than do anything else.
After I stop crying - it lasts only a few moments, like a sun shower - I remember what Donna Tartt writes at the end of The Goldfinch , which I've just finished: that loving a thing of beauty, whatever thing it may be, connects you through time to everyone who's ever loved that thing. A flower, like all life, is ephemeral. But a garden, if loved, can live forever.

Full text:   Heather Rolleston of architects Alliance crafts a rational, ordered condo for Tridel at Church and Carlton
jmays@globeandmail.com
No outcome of the Industrial Revolution has shaped the look and sense of the city more decisively than the internal combustion engine - though the elevator, because it makes tall buildings possible, has had an impact almost equally deep and enduring.
In an interesting new book about the history and cultural significance of lifts, German journalist Andreas Bernard shows how elevators radically changed the interiors of multiunit residential structures from multifarious and haphazardly laid out to rational, ordered, impersonal.
The emergence of this novel kind of space, in turn, generated the abstract, skeleton-conscious exterior style that dominated worldwide skyscraper design from 1945 until the very recent past.
Though some local tall-building architects have risen up to challenge it, this machine-age aesthetic is surely well-rooted and vigorous in Toronto. Peter Clewes and his colleagues at architectsAlliance (aA), for example, have been expressing the classic modernist manner in one critically acclaimed highrise after another since the onset of Hogtown's current condo boom. The Toronto buildings by Mr. Clewes have typically been elegant, confident, sharply focused interventions in the urban landscape.
For the past 15 years, Heather Rolleston has been learning the art and business of skyscraper design at aA, where she is an associate. But the 33-storey residential block called Alter - it's for the mammoth Tridel Group, and is slated to go up on a corner of Church Street just south of Maple Leaf Gardens - marks her debut as an original interpreter of the modernism aA has long been known for. It's surely worth noting that this job is also Ms. Rolleston's first step out into the world as a member of the tiny international sorority of women who design tall buildings.
Ms. Rolleston prefers (she told me) to take an "inherently simple and logical" approach to the urban tower, and she dislikes architecture that goes in for "collage." The exterior appearance should reveal the "highly repetitive floorplates" characteristic of the tall building constructed around an elevator shaft.
Indeed, the edges of Alter's floorplates are aligned vertically.
The tower is a slender box standing atop a robust podium - a format much liked by the city's official planners. Its individual units do not thrust out or pull back, as has been happening in other new residential projects around Toronto. There are no curves, twists or other surprises, and, in order to avoid turning a backside toward the city in any direction, the structure's four faces are identical.
But if it breaks no new ground in terms of its overall shape, Alter is hardly devoid of artistic character or complexity.
Describing the composition of the façades isn't easy, but here goes:
Ms. Rolleston has envisioned each face as a stack of asymmetrical modules, each three storeys thick. Every module is framed by an open-jawed clamp clad with shining, opaque white glass. Between the teeth of this clamp, the window-walls of the suites gradually withdraw from one corner, angling inward until the clear glass is about 1.8 metres from the edge of the floorplate.
As the building rises, the open end of one clamp alternates with the closed end of the module below it, creating a broadly dramatic zig-zag rhythm of prominent white and retiring dark passages.
I've probably made this sound more complicated than it is, and even a little forbidding, with all that talk of clamps and teeth. But a glance at the renderings shows that Ms. Rolleston's art is as clear and rational as a well-made modernist highrise should be.
If I have a problem with this building, it has to do with size.
To my eye, the structure's strongly animated surfaces want to surge higher than 33 storeys, up to a summit half again as tall. But in fairness to all parties concerned, Ms. Rolleston and Tridel got as much height from the city as they could, though, the architect said, it was less than what they were asking for.
Neighbours, concerned about the shadows to be cast by Alter, opposed the scheme, and only a negotiated settlement between developer and community saved the project from being nixed altogether.
Which raises an old question that Toronto has yet to face squarely. Given an official plan that designates Church Street and other inner-city avenues appropriate for high-density residential development, how free of shadow can people who want to live deep downtown reasonably expect to be?
The case of Alter is settled, but the more general feud over shadows will certainly break out again and again in other contexts until the citizens decide, once and for all, what we think about this city's ongoing intensification.

Full text:   Canada's public broadcaster plans to shed up to a fifth of its staff by 2020 as part of a sweeping new vision to recalibrate the way it delivers news and programming to an increasingly mobile, ondemand audience.
At a testy town hall on Thursday, the CBC's president and CEO, Hubert Lacroix, unveiled a new five-year plan to staff that includes shifting resources out of the TV and radio divisions to drive a wave of new mobilefriendly content, scaling back some local evening newscasts from 90 minutes to as little as 30, and cutting between 1,000 and 1,500 jobs.
Unlike recent cutbacks at the CBC, including one that axed 657 other jobs last April, the new plan is about much more than saving money. It is an effort to transform the broadcaster from a television and radio powerhouse to a leaner, more nimble organization that targets smartphones and tablets first to find readers, viewers and listeners wherever they are.
"You're going to see us lead with mobility and digital," Mr. Lacroix told reporters, later adding, "over five years, you are going to get a smaller broadcaster."
While the CBC's English-language TV network has a handful of popular hits, such as Murdoch Mysteries and Dragons' Den , its share of the viewing audience has fallen in recent years. Its nightly newscast, The National , regularly places third behind the dominant CTV National News and Global National . It has largely missed out on snagging new viewers with on-demand services, where upstarts such as Vice Media, which programs for millennial viewers, have triumphed.
Costs remain a driving force of many decisions. The CBC has had to make multiple rounds of deep cuts to balance its annual budgets, compounded by the loss of revenue-rich hockey rights, in a cycle Mr. Lacroix says can't continue.
The corporation also aims to offload half of its real estate, or some two-million square feet, and Mr. Lacroix even told reporters if he had an offer on its flagship Toronto headquarters, "we would entertain it."
The savings will be focused squarely on content as the strategy aims to double the CBC's digital reach to a monthly audience of 18 million Canadians, banking heavily on the new mobile emphasis. That means substantial radio and TV resources will shift to produce news and video specifically tailored to mobile devices. More than half of CBC's online audience now get its news from a phone or tablet, signalling a sea change in habits.
"And that means not taking a traditional television product and just having it be smaller on a smaller screen. It means actually producing content that is for that mobile device," said Heather Conway, executive vice-president of English services.
For local news, too, the CBC plans to put much more emphasis on sending stories immediately throughout the day to mobile and digital platforms. Some regions or cities will see their early evening local TV news cut from 90 minutes to a baseline 30 minutes, though others with strong ratings or minority language communities will be "enhanced."
The plan will also sharply reduce the CBC's in-house production, though news, current affairs and radio are exempted.
Instead, the broadcaster plans to partner more with outside creators and will make fewer of its own documentaries - a move that spurred some of its most prominent personalities from Peter Mansbridge to David Suzuki to sign a letter expressing their alarm last week.
For instance, there will be staffing for only one production studio at the CBC headquarters in Toronto, said a union official briefed on the plan. The other studios could be rented out to other producers.
The main union representing CBC workers sees this as reducing services on TV.
"A lot of Canadians consume CBC news and services over the Internet and on mobile. But for us, it's still a reduction in services," said Marc-Philippe Laurin, CBC branch president of the Canadian Media Guild.
"The CBC will not be offering the same services across the country, to all Canadians in every community."

Even CBC's Toronto headquarters building would be sold if the right offer is received, CEO Hubert Lacroix says.

Clarification: A Friday story said CBC-TV's nightly newscast The National regularly places third behind CTV National News and Global National. In fact, if The National's airings on CBC News Network are taken into account, the program attracts more viewers, on average, than Global National.

Full text:   Morguard's new $162-million office building gives downtown Ottawa new public spaces infused with art, culture and heritage
A new landmark office tower has opened in downtown Ottawa which, through a deal with the city, delivers public spaces and cultural amenities to the community and sustainability features to its tenants.
Performance Court, a Class-A, 21-storey building, was developed by Morguard Corp. and Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan (HOOPP). Its conceptual design was chosen in a formal competition by the municipality, which owned the land at 150 Elgin St. in the city's business district.
The $162-million finished project includes a seventh-floor public terrace with sweeping views of the city, a pocket park, an art gallery and a 140-year-old heritage structure preserved partly within its walls. It's also built to LEED Gold standard, with green features such as an underground cistern, reduced energy consumption and locally sourced materials, including pine reclaimed from the bottom of the Ottawa River.
The 360,000-square-foot building is almost 90 per cent leased to an eclectic mix of organizations, including the Canada Council for the Arts and accounting firm KPMG. Bringing in such tenants, amidst a rising vacancy rate in the capital, stemming from federal government downsizing and slow private-sector growth, speaks to its unique elements and the draw of its public benefits.
"These are things you just don't get in a typical office building," says Margaret Knowles, senior vice-president of development for Morguard Investments Ltd., who calls Performance Court "unusual from start to finish."
The building's name is intended to signify its commitment to performance, from its environmentally sustainable architecture and design by Montreal's NEUF architect(e)s to the ability of the arts community to engage in its public spaces. Ms. Knowles says that Morguard was especially favoured in the city's 2003-04 design competition because it was "respectful" of the 1878 First Baptist Church and the 1875 Grant House, both on its forecourt. The latter will become the flagship restaurant of Stephen Beckta, an award-winning local restaurateur.
She says Morguard was also chosen for its sleek podium design, which makes Performance Court less overbearing on surrounding buildings, as well as its low carbon footprint and commitment to honour the building's location on traditional Algonquin land.
Peter Radke, manager of realty initiatives and development for the City of Ottawa, says the building's public space "makes it more interactive with the streetscape." The project brings a more diverse look and unique character to the city, he says, noting that Morguard has also provided a 10-year lease at a reduced rate to Tourism Ottawa, which will be able to hold events on the building terrace.
The wide-open, panoramic space, which overlooks landmarks such as Ottawa City Hall and Confederation Square and has views to the magnificent Gatineau Hills in the distance, stretches for 6,000 square feet atop the podium. It is open to the public until midnight seven days a week, with gardens, benches, a fireplace and a large barbecue for tenant use. Ms. Knowles says it's already taking bookings for events, such as receptions.
The grand three-storey street-level entrance atrium - appropriately for Ottawa named the Winter Garden - includes Ajagemo, a 3,000-square-foot street-level art gallery that displays curated exhibitions of contemporary artwork from the Canada Council Art Bank. Ajagemo means "crossroads" in Algonquin, and the aboriginal heritage is echoed in the installation of a traditional birch-bark canoe made by Algonquin artist Daniel (Pinock) Smith. Just inside the building's main doors is a three-storey high interactive video wall, for which the Canada Council is commissioning original digital art.
Ms. Knowles says that Class-A buildings today "have to give that extra value, otherwise you're not going to get top dollar and you're not going to get the kind of tenants we're getting."
Robert Sirman, director and chief executive officer of the Canada Council, whose logo is above the building entrance, says the interior and exterior public spaces allow the organization to "increase our civic and cultural footprint in Ottawa, and invite residents and visitors alike to interact with the arts in new ways."
He says the Canada Council wanted to transmit its values and mandate into its offices. "You walk in off the street and you know you're in artistically animated space."
Grant McDonald, office managing partner at KPMG, which has its name atop the building, says Performance Court offered "the professional image we were looking for," which is critical to recruitment and retention of staff and clients in its highly competitive field. "We think this is something that will put us over the edge."
Other tenants in the building include e-commerce company Shopify, as well as Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and the New Zealand High Commission.
Kelvin Holmes, managing director with Colliers International in Ottawa, says buildings with significant amenities are largely sought after by private-sector companies or organizations looking for "competitive advantage," branding themselves and attracting talent and customers.
With its so-called 2.0 real estate strategy, meanwhile, the federal government is reducing the footprint it needs to house staff, as well as decentralizing. Where the city's vacancy rate was a low 5 per cent a couple of years ago, it's now 9.5 per cent and rising, Mr. Holmes notes. With recent pullouts by the public service, the vacancy rate for Class-C buildings is 23.7 per cent, for Class-B buildings it's 8.5 per cent and for Class-A buildings it's 7.4 per cent.
Performance Court adds to the vacancy rate, he says, but such buildings may encourage young, dynamic companies to locate in Ottawa. A new convention centre, light-rail system and condo development are bringing people downtown, he adds. "We'll be seeing a greater emphasis on the people side of real estate, rather than just the numbers."
Tenants such as Shopify "want to be in the core, because that's where their employees want to be. People don't want to get in the car any more and spend an hour commuting," Ms. Knowles agrees.
She says that Performance Court sets a new standard for urban development everywhere. "We meticulously thought through every detail to build a landmark in Ottawa that will define sustainable commercial real estate development for years to come."
***********
BUILDING FACTS
* The project's $162-million cost includes restoration of the heritage Grant House.

Full text:   Suzanne Desroches sums up the Lac-Megantic real-estate market when she tells how her own house sale is going.
"No calls, no visits, nothing," the newly retired 58-year-old says of her dwelling in the town that made international headlines almost a year ago when a runaway train laden with volatile fuel oil jumped the tracks and exploded.
Forty-seven people were killed and most of Lac-Megantic's downtown was destroyed in the July 6, 2013, disaster.
One year later, efforts are under way to rebuild, yet there's still a lot of work needed to repair streets and decontaminate soil.
Ms. Desroches has a little bit of time on her side before she turns into a "snowbird" and heads off to spend her winters in either Texas or California, but Lise Letourneau doesn't have the same luxury.
Her house, which was almost completely renovated, has been on the market for nearly two years.
She and her family have already moved to St-Georges-de-Beauce and she's looking forward to winding things up.
"We're still renting in St-Georges because we failed to sell our house. It would be hard to have two mortgages at the same time."
Ms. Letourneau, who was a florist in Lac-Megantic's downtown before leaving, estimates the family has spent $25,000 to $30,000 since leaving their former home.
There's plenty of competition for potential buyers and locals say "For Sale" signs have sprung up all over the town in recent months.
"I've never seen so many houses for sale in Lac-Megantic," Ms. Desroches said.
Nicholas Bouffard, a real-estate broker at Sutton Quebec, said the overall gloom of the provincial real-estate market coupled with the effects of the train derailment are pointing to a disastrous year for the home-sales market.
"I have five condos and a building on the market," Mr. Bouffard said in an interview. "Nothing is moving.
"When the events with the train happened, long-time owners put their properties up for sale super quick. The average home price in Lac-Megantic is about $150,000. I watched the first sales [since the derailment] and they all sold for $15,000 to $20,000 below market price. It's about 10-per-cent less."
Jocelyn Fortin, a real estate broker at Re/Max, sees the situation in a less dramatic light.
According to data provided to The Canadian Press, 18 properties were sold between Jan. 1 and June 16 this year, compared to 22 in the same period last year. The sold properties include single-family houses, condos and land.
"I don't sense panic on the part of sellers," said Ms. Fortin. "But the inventory is much higher than last year and the market is slow - as it is everywhere else - so there is an accumulation."
Mr. Bouffard insisted the derailment is having its effect on the market.
"Are you going to buy a condo for $300,000 in a city where there is not even a bridge to cross and go to the store?" he said.
The Quebec Environment Department has estimated that decontamination in the devastated area should be complete "no later than Dec. 12, 2014."
Repairs to one of the town's main streets should be completed by mid-July, said Louis Longchamps, a spokesman for Mayor Colette Roy Laroche.
Rita Lapointe put her bungalow up for sale in mid-March so she could move closer to her children, who live in the Montreal area. The 83-year-old isn't expecting a quick turnaround.
"The timing is wrong to sell, that's for sure," she said. "There are big trucks filled with soil, gravel, anything you want, coming one after another. It's far from ideal."
She said she hopes the community isn't stigmatized by the railway tragedy as well as the destruction of its core.
"It shouldn't influence people or discourage them from coming to settle here," she said. "There have always been trains here. This is the first time that a disaster like this has happened."

Connie Saliwonczyk is a rarity in Canada - an aboriginal female entrepreneur and a firm supporter of the Northern Gateway pipeline.
Her endorsement of Enbridge Inc. 's pipeline is born out of naked economic self-interest. Her company, based in Alberta's Frog Lake First Nation, operates various oil patch service vehicles, including a vacuum truck for cleaning up small oil spills. She would be in line to bid for work if the pipeline gets built.
"As a businessperson, it would definitely benefit me," she said. "And it benefits people on the reserve because I hire First Nations people. For me, it's showing people that anybody can do it."
Ms. Saliwonczyk notwithstanding, Northern Gateway now faces a potentially drawn-out legal fight with First Nations, primarily in B.C., that could stall or even block the pipeline, thwarting the dream of getting oil sands crude to the Pacific Coast and on to Asian markets.
Even the federal government, which conditionally approved the project last week, has acknowledged that Enbridge "clearly" has work to do to bring many First Nations on side.
It isn't just about consultation and winning support. Longer term, governments and resource companies need to demonstrate to individuals in First Nations communities that they have a real economic stake in resource development.
And until there is a critical mass of aboriginal-owned businesses - ready and able to seize opportunities - securing First Nations buy-in on resource projects will continue to be a tough sell in Canada.
Too little has been done to build aboriginal businesses from the ground up - in part, because access to capital is so difficult. Banks are notoriously reluctant to lend to would-be aboriginal entrepreneurs, who are often short on experience, rarely have a credit history and can't put up real estate as collateral because direct home ownership generally does not exist in First Nations communities.
More typically, resource companies have worked to win support for their projects by dangling temporary jobs and cash for high-profile community investments, including hockey rinks and other local infrastructure. To its credit, Enbridge has offered First Nations a 10-per-cent share of the pipeline and up to 15 per cent of pipeline construction jobs.
If pipelines, oil projects, mines or logging operations are going to go ahead, First Nations must derive more enduring benefits. And the key lies in the thorny notion of ownership - of land, of resources and of the businesses that stand to gain from their exploitation.
"If you want to affect a community, you have to do it at the individual level. Finance someone's purchase of a water truck or a welding machine, and suddenly you have affected eight people in that community," argued Rob Rollingson, general manager of Calgary-based Indian Business Corp., which lent money to Ms. Saliwonczyk when traditional lenders balked.
IBC, for example, created 27 years ago with seed money from the federal government, does development lending in First Nations communities similar to the way microfinance is done in poorer countries.
"You can't buy your way through [aboriginal communities] any more," Mr. Rollingson explained. "You have to offer real solutions and real value . . . It just can't be for a two-year project. It's a matter of what is sustainable after this thing is built and goes through."
Access to capital remains the "biggest constraint" to stimulating First Nations investment, keeping capital within the local economy and increasing long-term economic sustainability, according to a recent study of development lending by Toronto-based Impakt.
The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development took a similarly long view of the challenge, warning that numerous projects could face disruptions unless Canada does more to help resource companies "engage with affected aboriginal groups so that projects bring long-term benefits to these communities."
Time isn't on the side of those seeking quick approval of Northern Gateway and other projects. Governments and resource companies are already decades behind in changing the economic reality for First Nations people.
There are still too few entrepreneurs such as Ms. Saliwonczyk, who spent nine years building up her company, Connie's Oil Field Lease Maintenance Ltd., which now employs as many as 10 people in peak season.
"It was a long struggle," she said. "It wasn't easy."

Full text:   Not too cheap and not too hard on the bank account, the Holy Grail of wine is in the $15 to $25 range
Hunting for good bargain red Bordeaux can be like playing the lotto. You consult your horoscope, recite an incantation, clutch your talisman, anxiously make your pick, hand over the cash and brace for almost certain disappointment. That's why I want to draw special attention to the first item in the list of overachieving $15 to $25 values below. It's a sort of Holy Grail wine: not so cheap or common that you'd be embarrassed to give it as a host's gift yet so much smarter and more satisfying a purchase than many reds selling for pretentious multiples of the price.
Château Canteloup is the humble "second" label of an already modest estate called Château La Gorce, one of those many château labelled Cru Bourgeois that were excluded from the hoity-toity 1855 classification of "important" grand cru properties. Founded in 1821, La Gorce had seen good times before falling into a long period of disrepair. In 1980 it was taken over by a man named Raoul Fabre, who has been improving the wines ever since.
The Canteloup, mostly consisting of merlot from the great 2010 vintage, can't be called a bargain-basement wine even in France, where it sells for EUR8.50, or $12.50, at the winery. But I think it's impressive the Fabre family can turn out a ripe, full-bodied red this handsome and balanced and still turn a profit.
Speaking of Fabres, the second (also noteworthy) wine in the selections below was made by Eric Fabre (no relation to Raoul, I believe). This latter Monsieur Fabre has appeared in this column before. He used to be chief winemaker at vaunted Château Lafite Rothschild, one of the top five producers wines in the 1855 classification, but in 2001 he planted himself closer to the warm Mediterranean. Now he produces his own cuvees from the more affordable real estate of the Languedoc, relying on such local grapes as syrah, grenache, mourvèdre and bourboulenc rather than Bordeaux's cabernet and merlot. Lafite's loss is a wine value-seeker's gain.
Snap up the wines of Château d'Anglès La Clape any time you find them, I say. To do so would be the opposite of playing the lottery. A sure bet.
**********
Château Canteloup 2010 (France)
SCORE: 90 PRICE: $16.95
This is elegantly poised Bordeaux with great depth of flavour, offering layers of currant, coffee, cedar and graphite. Drink it now or over the next five years. It would match well with roast beef or grilled lamb chops. Available in Ontario.
Château d'Anglès La Clape Classique Red 2010 (France)
SCORE: 91 PRICE: $16.95
The winemaker formerly behind Bordeaux's hallowed Château Lafite Rothschild, Eric Fabre has been crafting his own excellent and reasonably priced wines for more than a decade at this outstanding Languedoc estate. Witness this full-bodied, smooth gem, a blend of syrah, grenache and mourvèdre brimming with concentrated fruit, coffee, smoked meat and spices. Introduce it to braised short ribs. Available in Ontario.
Muriel Rioja Vendimia Seleccionada Reserva 2008 (Spain)
SCORE: 91 PRICE: $19.95
Fans of classic, savoury Rioja should be pleased here. Muriel's 2008 Reserva exhibits the softness that comes with almost six years of age, combining juicy cherry with espresso, herbs, coconut and a nuance of funky barnyard in a medium-full-bodied package. $27.99 in B.C.
Kings Ridge Pinot Noir 2012 (Oregon)
SCORE: 91 PRICE: $20.95
A whole lot of pinot for the dough. It's concentrated and jammy but hardly a mere New World fruit-bomb.

Drink it now with duck breast or cellar it for up to five years. Available in limited quantities in Ontario.
Gruhier Extra Brut Cremant de Bourgogne 2010 (France)
SCORE: 91 PRICE: $20.95

Schloss Schonborn Erbacher Marcobrunn Riesling Kabinett 2008 (Germany)
SCORE: 91 PRICE: $21.95
Off-dry and plump, with sweet apricot and zesty lime flavours, here's a complex German riesling with an added - and wonderful - note of Autobahn fumes. It would evolve well for perhaps a decade or more in the cellar or pair perfectly now with a range of foods, including grilled, smoked or sauteed freshwater fish, cheeses and light curries. Available in Ontario.
Fort Berens Riesling 2013 (British Columbia)
SCORE: 90 PRICE: $18
Light and technically dry but with a core of subtle sweetness, this delivers an orchard-fruit medley balanced with just the right level of acidity. It won a gold medal at the Pacific Rim Wine Competition. Available direct through www.fortberens.ca.
La Ferme du Mont Le Ponnant Côtes du Rhône-Villages 2011 (France)
SCORE: 90 PRICE: $19.95
Full-bodied and very ripe, this fruit-forward juice could almost have come from sunny Australia. But it eventually serves up a side dish of French savouriness in the form of tobacco and peppery spice. Introduce it to a hearty red meat dishes. Available in Ontario.
Louis Latour Ardèche Chardonnay 2012 (France)
SCORE: 89 PRICE: $15.10
A consistent bargain, Latour's Ardèche delivered beautifully in 2012. This is poised, clean, medium-bodied chardonnay with good mid-palate depth and apple-like fruit supported by tight acidity. Your search for an affordable house chardonnay ends here. On sale in B.C. for $1 off, at $15.99, until June 28, various prices in Alberta, $17.97 in Newfoundland., $16.95 in PEI.
Laurenz V. Friendly Gruner Veltliner 2012 (Austria)
SCORE: 88 PRICE: $19.95

Full text:   Vancouver builder focused on sustainability completes its first from-scratch build, resulting in a modern, eco-friendly head-turner
The last thing Martin Warren planned to do was to demolish a house and build a new one.
His company, Vanglo Sustainable Construction Group, was named, not as a statement, he says, but as a goal. "Not an hour in the day passes when that goal doesn't come up."
And knocking down a livable property to rebuild and turn a profit is not in his ethical wheelhouse.
Yet, here we are, sitting at the dining room table of the company's first from-scratch build - a startlingly modern addition to Vancouver's Main Street neighbourhood, on a street where the only previous sense of style was the lack of one.
It wasn't supposed to be this way.
Known locally for their renovation work on heritage houses and for the design of some of the city's hippest restaurants - the original Boneta, the short-lived Corner Suite Bistro Deluxe, award-winning vegetarian spot The Parker - Vanglo was, Mr. Warren says, looking for their first total build project.
"The criteria were: It had to be in a neighbourhood I'd want to live in, and we had to build a house I'd want to live in, too."
The goal was to create what Mr. Warren calls a "healthy house" that was low maintenance, using sustainable materials and built to the highest energy-efficient standards.
While contemplating an empty lot on East 17th Avenue, they became distracted when a property across the street came up for sale.
A derelict hodgepodge of a house that the company thought would be great to renovate, it went to another buyer, before appearing back on the market a mere six months later. Vanglo pounced.
"We bought it in 2012 hoping to renovate," Mr. Warren says. "But it was such a mess, the bank deemed it 'unlivable,' and it was going to cost us so much to get it up to code, it dawned on us that this was our new build."
The result is a head-turner: a sleek, undulating structure that appears beamed back from the future - local kids call it the spaceship - it has curb appeal in spades.
Sitting on a decidedly odd lot - 66 by 44 feet - and pushed right up to the sidewalk (the front property line of the townhouse block next door sits on the back property line of the house), the design constraints gave Mr. Warren and collaborating architect Oliver Lang an interesting challenge.
"We didn't want to build an ugly tall rectangle," Mr. Warren smiles. "So we came up with this multi-faceted front that provides some shape."
Inside, that shape led to a linear floor structure - open plan kitchen/living room/roof deck upstairs; three bedrooms, two baths downstairs - which allowed full exploitation of the south-facing frontage, with masses of natural light flooding in through multiple artfully placed windows.
It also lent itself to one of the features Mr. Warren is most excited about: no load-bearing walls within the house (the frame consists of TJI trus joists made from engineered wood), allowing future residents to reconfigure the interior to suit their needs.
The result is a hyper modern interior, with heated concrete floors and white walls, accented with poplar - stairs, cabinetry, master bath ceiling - to warm things up and give an organic feel.
The attention to detail is notable: every conceivable storage space becomes a sleek push-release drawer; the master shower floor is heated to allow for quick drying and to negate the possibility of mould.
A legal, full-height, one-bedroom basement suite, finished to the same high standards as the main residence offers a budgetary incentive for purchasers looking to break into the sought-after neighbourhood (it's listed at $2,228,000), and a 400 square foot "flex-space" heated garage offers creative solutions to those wanting to remain urban, but needing room to expand.
Looks, of course, aren't everything, but scratch this property's surface and Vanglo's commitment to sustainability shines through.
First, the original house on the site was diligently recycled, with concrete, drywall and roofing materials all sent to recycling plants. The exterior was taken to a local firm - Urban Woodways - who converted 95 per cent of it into bioethanol fuel.
The new property is Energy Star certified - according to Mr. Warren, one of only three such properties in Vancouver - and features a water and air-tight exterior membrane, triple-pane fibreglass windows (with a lifetime guarantee) and a maintenance-free metal roof. Fresh filtered air is circulated throughout the home every two-and-a-half-hours by a heat recovery ventilator (HRV).
Energy bills are estimated to come in at least 25 per cent lower than the average house.
Mr. Warren can hardly contain his pride in the finished product.
"It is beyond what we were hoping for," he says. "I think it's fun and sophisticated."
But would he want to live in it?
"Definitely!"

Full text:   Language evolves; we must accept this. And I do, grudgingly. But does it hurt to poke a little fun along the way?
'Could I just grab your membership card?" the sales clerk asked. "No," I thought, "but you could have it or you could take it."
She works at a well-known big-box store, the one that in my home town thanks you for your "collaboration" when you return your shopping cart to the corral.
I am not sure why I was taken aback by her asking to "grab" my card. I hear that word almost every time I shop. Clerks offer to grab a different size or colour, servers in restaurants grab the menu or another coffee for me.
Maybe I had a mental image of her suddenly and rudely seizing or snatching the card. She didn't. She just took it, and after I'd paid I went on my way. I returned the cart, but did not recall working together with anyone to plan that undertaking. Everything was perfect.
Whenever I tap or swipe my credit card at the grocery store, it is somehow "perfect." Almost every time I answer a simple question, the response is "perfect." The other day I was giving information over the phone to my cable and telephone provider. "Your date of birth? ... Perfect. Your address? ... Perfect. Your e-mail address? ... Perfect."
When she asked again for my date of birth I could not resist reminding her that I had already given it to her, and that she'd thought it was perfect (It isn't. Just the other day, of the six obituaries in our local newspaper five of the deceased people had dates of birth more recent than mine.)
She probably told a co-worker that she had just finished with today's crabbiest client, as I wasn't using the "filters" that my daughter keeps reminding me about. I guess that is the new way of saying "think before you speak." It is probably awesome when you remember to do that.
Last week I was looking at recipes online and found an Awesome Slow-cooker Pot Roast. It had to be good! My Webster's dictionary defines "awesome" as "inspiring awe" and "awe" as "a feeling of deep wonder and respect for overpowering grandeur."
Thinking that this dictionary must be out of date, I consulted my Webster's New World Dictionary of American Language only to read "a mixed feeling of reverence, fear and wonder caused by something majestic, sublime, sacred, etc."
I wonder what adjective the submitter of the pot-roast recipe (and those people who have eaten awesome bacon cheeseburgers, witnessed awesome hockey goals, purchased items at an awesome sale) would use if she or he saw the Grand Canyon for the first time, or walked into Saint Peter's Basilica or came upon the Blessed Virgin Mary in a field near San Sebastian, Spain. Maybe "awesomest."
Until recently, an icon was a picture or other representation of Jesus, Mary or a saint. It was rarely used. Now every singer, movie actor and sports figure is an icon - though most are not even close to nomination for sainthood. "Iconic" Justin Bieber is a case in point. Newscasters and interviewers love that word. I cannot even remember what adjective they used before: Great? Important? Well-known?
Language evolves, especially the English language. We do not have an organization like the French Academy, which according to Wikipedia "scours the land for invasive words from other languages" and tries, somewhat ineffectively, to curb their usage.
Chaucer and Shakespeare would surely be astonished, even horrified, if they attempted to read the best literature of today. We must accept and even embrace this process - and I do, or I grudgingly try to. But does it hurt to poke a little fun at it along the way?
I was recently astounded when asked for my "parameters." I had taken something into a shop to be repaired. That sent me back to my New World dictionary, where I learned that a parameter is: "1. a quantity or constant whose value varies with the circumstances of its application; 2. any constant, with variable values used as a referent for determining other values."
As it turned out, the man was asking for my address. Well now, let's see. My address has been constant for 35 years, but its value does vary: It goes up each year on my Real Property Assessment and Tax Notice, but has gone down in the current real-estate market. The gentleman I surreptitiously laughed at may have been a lexical semanticist at heart.
When I told my daughter about the incident, she recalled how she had recently been asked for her "co-ordinates." That also meant address. Well, I am ready for that one: Longitude 64.775, Latitude 46.094.

LISTING AGENT
Bill Thom, Re/Max Realtron Realty Inc.
The Action: Just one street over from a local park in Willowdale, this 4,600-square-foot residence sits amid custom-built homes. Listed at $2.35-million, the sellers skipped on some low bids, but were happy to negotiate a deal for $2.2-million in March.
What They Got: Within the last year, this nearly 20-year-old house was extensively renovated, starting with a new stone driveway, front entrance and south-facing deck off the sky-lit kitchen outside, followed by wrought iron stair railings, pot lights and hardwood floors inside.
* Additional luxuries include interior access to the triple garage and nine-foot ceilings above the living and dining areas, a panelled library and a family room with one of two gas fireplaces.
* For casual play, there is a lower level games and fireside recreation room with a wet bar and access to the 66-by-128-foot lot.
* Cleaning up is easy with a main-floor laundry room, central vacuum system and seven bathrooms, including five ensuites.
The Agent's Take: "It's on a very exclusive street and it's arguably one of the best streets in [the area]," agent Bill Thom said. "The street is short, quiet and 90 per cent of the homes have been converted into big homes, so it's very uniform."
"Most people have stone fronts and brick on the other three sides, but this is all stone all around, so that's unique," Mr. Thom notes.

Full text:   A rumrunner's mansion that hosted Al Capone and was home to Paul Martin Sr. is rejuvenated
A Prohibition-era bootlegger's mansion that heritage buffs feared would be demolished has regained its Roaring Twenties dazzle thanks to the owner of a kitchen cabinet company.
Devonshire Lodge was built in 1928 by Harry Low, a toolmaker who struck it rich catering to the thirst of booze-deprived Americans. With his wallet fattened by the cross-border smuggling of whisky and beer, Mr. Low spent the then-massive sum of $130,000 to construct one of Windsor's grandest mansions, a sprawling Cotswold cottage where the likes of gangster Al Capone would come for business and stay for a drink.
Mr. Low's high-flying career as a whisky merchant proved to be short-lived, however. During the 1930s, under constant watch for tax evasion, suspected of having had an employee murdered and having made several high-risk investments that went south, he lost the 4,800-square-foot house and adjacent 1,700-square-foot coach house.
Devonshire went through several owners before federal Liberal party power broker Paul Martin Sr. and wife Nell bought it in 1961. The family sold it in 1995 after Mr. Martin's death.
Thanks to this lineage, Devonshire Lodge is likely the only house anywhere that can lay claim to having hosted America's most notorious gangster as well as two sitting Canadian prime ministers - Lester Pearson and Pierre Trudeau - plus a young man who would grow up to become another prime minister.
That former young man, Paul Martin Jr., chuckles at the thought of finding himself in such company. "That's quite a rogue's gallery," he says as he reminisces about the house his parents bought while he attended university.
"When I came home from university, that's where I came home to. I spent a lot of time in that house. My sister spent a lot of time growing up in the house."
Mr. Martin recalls how proud his father was of the home's rumrunner history. "My dad used to tell everybody this was Harry Low's house, and my mother would say, 'stop telling everyone!'"
Mr. Martin's wife, Sheila, who grew up nearby, recalls how the rumrunner days were not spoken of in polite company when she lived in the home's upscale Walkerville neighbourhood a generation or so later. "You wonder how the story of the house went over with the neighbourhood, because Walkerville was so very staid," she says.
Her husband says he retains fond memories of the place and is delighted and grateful it's being restored. "I'll never forget the picture of my father in the library. To this day I can see him sitting in his chair and working away on his memoirs."
After the Martins, the house endured several more owners and descended into the depths of disrepair. Heritage buffs feared it was at serious risk of being demolished. Windsor cabinet-maker Vern Myslichuk first laid eyes on Devonshire Lodge 16 years ago in its darkest days. The house, set amid Windsor's finest mansions in the Walkerville neighbourhood, stood out as a sad wisp of its former glory and had come to be known as "Walkerville's shame."
When the opportunity came to buy the house in April, 2012, Mr. Myslichuk grabbed the once-grand residence. He saw that the interior had suffered extensive water damage, but that the house had been solidly constructed and remained structurally sound. He immediately began to restore it to its 1928 bling-filled past, a splendid creation of the flapper era, a place where one could imagine Jay Gatsby strolling through a garden party.
"It had been such an eyesore for years," Mr. Myslichuk said. "The day I was able to stand at the street and say, 'Yeah, now it's a house again.' That was the proudest moment for me."
Walkerville began as a 19th-century company town under whisky baron Hiram Walker. Today, it is part of Windsor, a courtly neighbourhood in a city where manufacturing is still important, a place of immaculate terrace homes, stately manors, leafy streets and pristine gardens.
The 21/2-storey Devonshire Lodge is constructed of rusticated stone and limestone trim, the only one of its kind for miles. The original roof of wooden shingles was imported from England and laid to look like traditional rollover Cotswold thatch. Built on the diagonal to the corner it faces, the house stands like a baronial country manor, the convex façade consisting of several bays with gables, a recessed balconette over the arched recessed entrance and leaded glass windows. Eaves and downspouts are copper, as is the panelling above the windows.
Inside, guests entering through the ornate arched wooden door are ushered in to a two-storey entranceway highlighted by a spiral oak staircase. The dark wall panelling is walnut and there is a cloister with 20-foot ceiling and 16 feet of bevelled leaded glass windows.
Friends warned Mr. Myslichuk against taking on the decaying property but, reasoned the owner of BetterMade Cabinets, most of the required work involved wood and "that's what I do for a living."
He set a budget and prepared to see it double, then went through the house saving as many original features and finishings as he could, while replicating those he couldn't. "I wanted it to look the way it did in Harry Low's day," he says.
Devonshire Lodge was custom-built in an era when things were built to last. All four second-storey bedrooms were designed with their own full bath and most of the bathroom fixtures - including two body showers - and tile work were saved. Most of the fixtures in the home's three more bathrooms were preserved as well.
Mr. Myslichuk was intent on authenticity so when the downstairs entranceway tile needed to be replaced, he tracked down the original manufacturer who, he was delighted to discover, was still in business.
The old boiler and piping were rusted out but Mr. Myslichuk liked the look of the original brass-fronted radiators so he kept them as decorative features when he installed two forced-air gas furnaces. He didn't want to spoil the home's look by adding modern thermal-pane glass windows and admits there are bound to be drafts this winter. Won't that make it expensive to heat? "If you can't buy gas for the sports car," he reasons, "don't buy the sports car."
For the sake of comfort, however, he had insulation blown into the walls of a sunroom that once served as the library. It is this room he plans to turn into a sort of tribute to the house's various owners. Currently researching all of the owners it has had over the years, Mr. Myslichuk will eventually incorporate into the panelled walls a subtle wooden plaque honouring each. Water destroyed the ceiling so Mr. Myslchuk had it rebuilt in cherry panelling.
Throughout the house, original doors were kept, as were the glass and brass doorknobs. Original cabinetry, built of maple, poplar and yellow pine, was refinished. Central to the kitchen is an immense icebox and while Mr. Myslichuk bowed to modern tastes by adding the latest refrigeration units, he repurposed the icebox for storage.
Mr. Myslichuk recalls walking in to the parlour that first day and cringing when he set eyes on the awful blue that a huge limestone fireplace had been painted. He set to work applying a gentle soda blasting technique to strip the stone, then repointed and reglazed it, returning the limestone to its glorious past.
Occasionally, the house gave up wonderful hints of its earlier life. In a pile of rubble in the basement, he found an original brass fireplace poker that had been discarded years ago. "I grabbed it and held it and I was afraid somebody was going to take it out of my hands. I was so excited," he recalls. Now it has been shined up and returned to its rightful spot next to the fireplace.
Some time in the past, some of the strip hardwood floors had been replaced with parquet hardwood. Mr. Myslichuk considered tearing it out and putting in modern hardwood, but opted instead to strip and refinish the parquet which, he says, is perfectly good.
Meanwhile, much of the wood panelling, coving and flooring are original. Even the entranceway coat closet is wood panelled. While much of the woodwork had been given a gloss finish in what Mr. Myslichuk believes was an attempt to lend it new life, he has stripped all the wood and applied a matte finish he considers more authentic to the home's era.
In the dining room, Mr. Myslichuk found a wire sticking out of the floor and learned it was part of a buzzer system installed throughout the house to summon servants. The one in the dining room fed through the tabletop and the buzzers sounded in the kitchen and pantry area.
What was his biggest reno challenge? "Everything," laughs Mr. Myslichuk. "It really didn't matter whether it was the porch, the plumbing, the electrical, the heating, the painting. Everything has taken more effort. Scraping the fireplace took four weeks and we worked on the electrical for three months. I'd figured 10 days."
Incredibly, much of the 85-year-old wiring was in good condition, with most of the BX-style, metallic sheathed cable wiring winning his electrician's seal of approval. "He told me it was better than most of what goes into houses today," Mr. Myslichuk said.
"The neighbours are very happy," Mr. Myslichuk says. Occasionally, one will drop by and share a fact or two about the home's history. Many were astounded to see the years of dirt scrubbed from the panels over the principal windows and discover they were copper. Soiled with age and neglect, the panels looked like wood.
Once the visitors started arriving, the stories began to flow. An elderly woman dropped by and told Mr. Myslichuk she recalled playing in the "old Low house" as a youngster. Another man said he remembered a photo of Harry Low, looking over stacks of $100 bills sitting on his dining room table. And Mr. Low's grandson, Bruce Low, told Mr. Myslichuk his grandmother recounted the story of Al Capone's visits, during which he would share a drink at the bar Mr. Low built in the cellar.
Paul Martin recalls that bar. "That was pretty neat," he says. But what he remembers most about the basement is the hours he and his sister and friends spent searching for the legendary tunnel Mr. Low was rumoured to have built to connect his house to the Detroit River for the transport of liquor, a distance of eight or nine blocks.
"We used to tell everybody about the tunnel," says Mr. Martin. "My sister and I spent a lot of time searching for that tunnel. Two-thirds of Windsor under the age of 20 went through the house looking for it," Mr. Martin laughs. "We never found any sign of it. My kid sister was convinced [it was there]. But we never found the proof."
Mr. Myslichuk smiles at the stories of the tunnel and says he "went exploring" after tips offered by some visitors. All he'll say is: "There's a few things that require more exploring. There are some things that are blocked up I'll investigate when I have more time."
Mr. Myslichuk will move in to Devonshire Lodge this month with his 20-year-old daughter, Corey, a University of Windsor student. He is finishing it a little at a time, saying he's letting the house itself dictate style and colour palette.
He's also slowly collecting pieces from Harry Low's era to lend authenticity. While the reconstruction work is finished, he considers the house a work in progress and next plans to take on the coach house, part of which will be turned back into the original three-car garage.
What was his greatest pleasure from the experience? "All along I was driven by thoughts of bringing the house back to life, making it a place again where there's laughter, there's a piano and furniture and the warmth of somebody living here again. The house just needed a good hug," Mr. Myslichuk said.
During the renovations, he has occasionally opened his doors to allow members of the public to visit and follow the progress, with funds from their visits donated to charity. It was at the end of one of those visits that Mr. Myslichuk says he was moved to tears.
Members of a local club had asked for a tour and as they stood at the bottom of the staircase, one of the women stepped forward and presented Mr. Myslichuk with a black-and-white photograph.
"It was these stairs," he says, "and there were two gentlemen standing to the side. You could see the stairs were being assembled. There was no ceiling, just rafters.
This was a photograph of the actual fabricating of the stairs. I literally cried. It was so incredible. The lady who gave me the photo, her father had owned Walker Lumber and he had been part of the build of this house."
The moment was typical of how the community has embraced Mr. Myslichuk's project to bring Devonshire Lodge back to life. One of Windsor's grandest homes has been saved from demolition and raised from decay, bringing back with it a colourful piece of local and Canadian history.
Devonshire Lodge will celebrate its reopening with public tours on June 7, from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., and June 8, from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. It sits at the corner of Ontario Street and Devonshire Road in Windsor's Walkerville neighbourhood. Admission is $10 for adults; children are free. Proceeds go to the Canadian Cancer Society.

Abstract: "[Michael Audain] is one of our strongest supporters, closest friends, advocates, cheerleader," said Ms. [Kathleen Bartels]. "Him and I have been partners on this project since 2003, so in many ways the two of us have been leading this together. He's been involved in every important decision, every important committee. Early on, we had our real estate subcommittee looking at sites - he chaired that. He's been with us every step of the way ... and I don't think that will ever change."

Full text:   Michael Audain, the former head of the Vancouver Art Gallery's relocation committee and a key voice in the campaign for a new gallery, is no longer a VAG trustee, exiting as chair of the Vancouver Art Gallery Foundation. His departure comes at a crucial time for the gallery, which has recently named an architect for the project, and is moving ever closer to a city-imposed deadline to raise $150-million.
Mr. Audain says after 16 years on the foundation board - 13 as chair - he decided not to remain beyond the end of his term. He is leaving, he says, as a result of "a lot of priorities" - which include the building of his own art museum in Whistler, scheduled to open in October, 2015.
"It's simply because I've got so many projects going on," Mr. Audain explained in an interview, making it clear that he is strongly in favour of the relocation project. "Obviously, we'll be supportive of the new building in due course."
Mr. Audain has also recently left his position on the board of the National Gallery of Canada Foundation (he stepped down as the National Gallery's board chair in July, 2012).
Chair of Polygon Homes, Mr. Audain, 76, is a wealthy real estate developer and a generous patron of the arts, with a keen interest in visual art - in particular art of the Northwest Coast. He and his wife, Yoshiko Karasawa, have amassed an astonishing personal art collection, with works by the likes of Emily Carr, Lawren Harris, Andy Warhol and Diego Rivera.
In Vancouver, as a result of his philanthropy, there is a gallery with the Audain name on it at both the Museum of Anthropology and SFU Woodward's; the Audain Prize for the Visual Arts awarded annually to a senior B.C. artist; and an Audain Curator of British Columbia Art at the VAG. Last year, he announced a $5-million gift for the Emily Carr University of Art + Design to create the Audain School of Visual Arts at the new campus; a year earlier he gave $5-million to the University of British Columbia to create the Audain Art Centre at UBC. There is a long list of recipients of Audain funding, including the Art Gallery of Greater Victoria and the Bill Reid Foundation.
But he is most closely associated with the VAG, where he joined the association board in 1990, and was first elected to the foundation board in 1998. As chair of the relocation committee, he became the face - along with gallery director Kathleen Bartels and then-board chair David Aisenstat - of the fight for a new, purpose-built facility.
But after years of vocal advocacy, Mr. Audain stunned the local art scene in 2012 by announcing he would build his own museum in Whistler. The $30-million, 56,000-square-foot museum, designed by Patkau Architects, will feature Northwest Coast works from his personal collection and will be funded by his foundation. Even a few months behind its original schedule, the Audain Art Museum is moving at lightning speed compared to the VAG project, which has been in the works for more than a decade and has a spring 2020 opening target date.
"Michael is one of our strongest supporters, closest friends, advocates, cheerleader," said Ms. Bartels. "Him and I have been partners on this project since 2003, so in many ways the two of us have been leading this together. He's been involved in every important decision, every important committee. Early on, we had our real estate subcommittee looking at sites - he chaired that. He's been with us every step of the way ... and I don't think that will ever change."
The VAG, which recently selected the Swiss architecture firm Herzog & de Meuron, has until the end of April to raise an additional $150-million from Ottawa and the province in order to meet the terms laid out by the city, which owns the land where the VAG plans to build.
Mr. Audain calls it "a great project" and said he will still be "a keen supporter." Nothing should be read into his decision to leave the board, he said - other than the fact that he is very busy.
"There's only so many things I can work on and take responsibility for, and that's a big, long-term project."
Revision date: Friday, June 06, 2014
CORRECTION: A Globe B.C. headline on Thursday incorrectly said Michael Audain "abruptly" resigned as chair and board member of the Vancouver Art Gallery Foundation. In fact, as the story made clear, Mr. Audain is leaving at the end of his term because of his commitment to many other projects.

Cracks emerge in the bedrock of China's economy

Abstract: "It's the third time in eight years it's happened," said Michael Spencer, chief Asia-Pacific economist at Deutsche Bank, of the price correction. But, he laughed, "it's heretical to suggest it isn't the end of the world."

Full text:   Nearly 300 kilometres north of Hong Kong, a coastal city is at the forefront of a worrisome new trend for China: falling house prices.
In May, new home prices in 62 Chinese cities edged downward from the month before, dragging down the Chinese average for the first time in nearly two years. The biggest decline came in Shantou, where prices fell 3.64 per cent from April, according to China Index Academy, a research arm of SouFun, which operates the country's largest real estate portal.
China's real estate market is the bedrock of its economy. Residential housing is worth some 12.5 per cent of GDP, and homes contain some two-thirds of Chinese household wealth. A fracture in Chinese housing, in other words, is a fracture in China's financial well-being.
And the slowdown has come with remarkable speed. Last December, Chinese housing prices rose 12 per cent year-on-year, the biggest gain of 2013. By May, sales were down more than 50 per cent from April at Shantou's Jiacheng Real Estate Agency. "Consumers are sitting back to watch the market," said Zhang Chunseng, an agent with Jiacheng.
For buyers, the change may come as a relief, since China-wide prices in May were still up year-on-year by 7.84 per cent.
But for China more broadly, the spectre of housing weakness heightens the concerns already gathering over the country's slowing economic expansion and vast accumulation of debt, sizable portions of which are rotten.
"When you see in the second and third-tier cities that developers are significantly discounting new-launch properties and holding very large inventories of unsold apartments, these are worrying signs," said Rajiv Biswas, chief Asia economist for IHS Global Insight.
He now places the odds of the economic shock from a "hard landing" at 30 per cent in the next three years.
"It's a reasonable risk," he said.
But even by that calculation, odds remain good that China skirts disaster. Buyers may be staying on the sidelines, but out of a sense of opportunism rather than fear. "People are not so nervous in my city," Ms. Zhang said.
In part, that's because this isn't entirely new. Though China's economy has pointed upward for three straight decades, its housing prices have not.
"It's the third time in eight years it's happened," said Michael Spencer, chief Asia-Pacific economist at Deutsche Bank, of the price correction. But, he laughed, "it's heretical to suggest it isn't the end of the world."
He doesn't believe it is. For all the growth in Chinese housing prices, "incomes go up faster," Mr. Spencer said. In relative terms, an average Chinese apartment is cheaper today than a decade ago. "So the idea that this is a bubble about to burst seems absurd at the national level," he said.
He points to official Chinese estimates that 10 million people move in to cities each year, a powerful demand pull that other markets where housing has crashed - the United States, and before that, Hong Kong - could not count on.
There may be some froth in the market, but it's nothing a price war can't clear out, he said.
"The truth is what we need is a market-clearing price. And when we get there, the market will clear and demand will return. And I don't think that price is 40 per cent off where we are today."
That's not to say there are no reasons to worry, in particular because the Chinese financial environment is increasingly uncertain. The broader economy is on track for its worst performance since 1990. Manufacturing has been weak. Vast quantities of government debt constitutes a drag on the existing system and hamstrings the ability of officials to intervene with stimulus dollars.
At the same time, intervening may not be difficult.
In early 2013, officials released a number of measures to cool the housing market in major Chinese cities, including the imposition of a higher capital gains tax and a ban on single people from buying more than one house. That plan has arguably succeeded. If the housing market slows too much, some of those measures can merely be rolled back.
"Housing, because of the credit element, is very sensitive to policy," said Tim Condon, chief Asia economist for ING Bank N.V.
Beijing "will be very sensitive to the risk of a crash in the market, and they have the policy levers to avoid one."
For now, Chinese officials remain publicly unflustered, with the state-owned People's Daily reporting Wednesday that "the government isn't expected to take any steps to boost the market."
Outside government, meanwhile, China's appetite for real estate remains robust.
There are powerful incentives for local officials to keep their housing markets roaring. Without it, in a country with virtually no property taxes, their revenues would vanish.
"As long as government still earns money by selling land, housing is impossible to cool down, no matter what the central government wants. If housing drops, how will local governments eat?" asked a man named Zhou, an executive at a Shantou advertising agency.
He owns nearly 10 houses, and is hunting for more. In part, that's because there aren't many other places to put money in China - "there are really few investment channels now. I don't know how to play stocks," he said.
"As long as there are opportunities, I will buy," Mr. Zhou said.

Full text:   Quebec fund to open Washington, Mexico and Singapore offices as part of increased emphasis on global investment strategy
Quebec's giant pension manager says it has a new strategy to become more global in its outlook, shifting its sights from a focus on Quebec investments to a broader international approach with new overseas offices in countries such as Mexico and Singapore.
Michael Sabia, chief executive officer of the Caisse de depôt et placement du Quebec , said Monday that both the Caisse and Quebec businesses more broadly need to adopt a more global investment perspective.
"It is our responsibility, our duty, to become this global organization able to search for yields where they can be found and to serve as a bridge toward the world for the Quebec economy," Mr. Sabia said in a speech to the Montreal Council on Foreign Relations.
"It will be one of the cornerstones of our work for the next five years."
While the Caisse already has offices in New York and Beijing, Mr. Sabia said the $200-billion fund, which invests money for Quebec public and private pension and insurance plans, will expand its New York office and open new offices in Washington, Mexico and Singapore. It will eventually also open offices in Mumbai and Sydney, he said.
He said the Caisse needs to be more global to earn the returns it needs, but said it needs to be done strategically in countries and companies with the best long-term growth prospects. Finding them requires staff on the ground who know local business markets, he said, and can help the Caisse get access to the best deals.
"We need to identify the locations and the most suitable projects - the most interesting for us that are best aligned with our goals," he said. "And to get your hands on each of these opportunities, the competition comes down to one word: fierce."
Mr. Sabia said the Caisse will also work with Quebec companies it owns to help them become more global in their outlook. He said Quebeckers should not be "deluded" about the depth and size of their home market, which accounts for just 0.3 per cent of the global economy.
International exports from Quebec have fallen by 1 per cent annually since 2000 and account for 27 per cent of GDP, he said, down from 42 per cent in 2000. Productivity in the United States and the rest of Canada has increased annually at three times the rate it has in Quebec, he said.
"If we want to reverse the economic situation, it is necessary to participate much more intensely in global growth," he said.
As a result, he said the Caisse will identify and invest in Quebec companies that can position themselves for global markets and will encourage entrepreneurs who are "facing the world."
"Doing business in the entire world must become a reflex in Quebec - a contagious reflex," he said.
The Caisse has already laid the groundwork for boosting its foreign investing by hiring private equity fund manager Andreas Beroutsos last month to head a new private equity and infrastructure team focused on investments outside of Quebec. It also hired former World Bank official Rashad Kaldany last year to head its emerging markets investment team.
Mr. Sabia said one area of focus for foreign investing will be the agri-food sector as millions of people a year join the middle class and want "more food of better quality." He said he is also interested in real estate investments, such as shopping malls and residential housing, in developing economies, as well as infrastructure investments such as roads and airports.
The Caisse will also look for investments that take advantage of changes to the way energy is produced and distributed in North America and in many other countries, he said.

Full text:   Mayor Rahm Emanuel is using everything but Jedi mind tricks to persuade Star Wars creator George Lucas to put his planned museum of art and movie memorabilia in Chicago.
Lucas has been talking to San Francisco about a location. At first blush, the West Coast bid seems obvious. It's Lucas' hometown. San Francisco Mayor Edwin Lee on Thursday sent Lucas a letter offering the museum a spot on the city's scenic waterfront.
Emanuel, a former White House chief of staff, is known for going after big amenities that can burnish Chicago's global reputation, and he sees himself as the city's salesman-in-chief.
But what can Chicago offer in the war for the Lucas Cultural Arts Museum? Here are five things to know about its bid:
Hey, Chewie. Meet da bears
The city is offering up a slice of real estate along the Lake Michigan shore front and near other big attractions such as the Shedd Aquarium. The site is currently a parking lot south of Soldier Field, meaning fans dressed up as Chewbacca and Darth Vader might have to cross paths with rowdy Bears tailgaters.
Is Emanuel being played?
All good negotiators know you need to play one side against another. And assertions by local news outlets that Chicago is or was a front-runner may have helped wrest a better deal out of San Francisco, which rejected Lucas' first choice of a location near the Golden Gate Bridge. Lee has acknowledged his city was not a shoo-in, but said he wouldn't easily give up the fight.
Either way, Emanuel stands to gain, if only from the publicity that comes with contending for big-time attractions and events.
The second city is Lucas's
'second home'
Lucas feels an affinity for Chicago, where he has spent a lot of time, since his wife, prominent businesswoman Mellody Hobson, is from the city. In a statement welcoming Chicago's bid, Lucas even called it his "second home."
This may - or may not - be the city you're looking for
Emanuel's Chicago fancies itself a big-league centre of high-tech and innovation, and it does have some street cred there, with companies like Boeing and sensations like Groupon. And while the San Francisco area can boast companies like Apple and Google, Lucas spokesman David Perry has praised Chicago for the attention it lavishes on culture, architecture, innovation and education - some of the lofty themes the museum will seek to promote.
What Chicagoans say
Some of Chicago's most important civic leaders are behind the push to bring the museum. Emanuel has enlisted a task force with the likes of architect Jeanne Gang and Walter Massey, president of the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.
But not everyone is so keen. Northwestern University English professor Bill Savage, in a column this week for Crain's Chicago Business, suggested the museum would be a glorified holding tank for movie props better suited to Las Vegas.

The developers behind a new low rise in the Upper Beaches say they've found that buyers' reluctance to embrace condo living stems from fear that they will have to forgo some of the things they see as central to home ownership.
So gardeners, car enthusiasts and handymen buying at Kingston & Co., will find a rooftop garden with vegetable plots, a car washing bay and a fully-equipped workshop, among other amenities and conveniences.
"For people looking to downsize, their concerns are the compromises they'd have to make, so we wanted to make an environment that was compromise-free but an enhancement in terms of minimizing their maintenance and hassle aspect of owning a home," says Mazyar Mortazavi, president and CEO of TAS, which is developing the infill project alongside Main & Main Developments Inc.
"We're introducing a workshop, tool room and car wash area - places you'd typically have in a garage or secondary space outside of the home."
Furthermore, the 10-storey building at 1100 Kingston Rd., just east of Victoria Park Avenue, will also provide services suited for these spaces where residents can entertain, exercise and engage in the trades.
"It's easy to put a label on a door and give people a pass ... but we're going far beyond just labelling. The operational side is really important to us," says Mr. Mortazavi, who notes the tool room as an example.
"We're working with an organization that is going to put in a tool library and ... manage the tool catalogue so things are properly repaired. And we'll have workshops to teach people how to use the tools."
As another means to address the realities of condo living, there will be about 150 suites ranging up to three-bedroom-plus-den models and units can be combined into a larger one.
"Our average unit size in this building is around 900 square feet, which is unheard of in the current market," Mr. Mortazavi said.
There will be stylish entertaining areas with nine-foot ceilings, hardwood, stone and stainless steel finishes, but also laundry rooms and linen closets.
"The one thing we really focused on in the floor plans is all the spaces people don't think about when they're buying, like where do you put your vacuum, mop, bucket, iron and detergent?" Mr. Mortazavi said.
Single and double-width balconies with coloured panels facing south to the lake and deep terraces with harvest planters oriented to the north to the city will add practical, yet playful elements to the exterior of the modern mid-rise designed by award-winning firm Teeple Architects.
"Having this new project there - with new retail and increased density - will play a significant role in extending that quality and character that is unique to Kingston Road west of Victoria Park," explains Mr. Mortazavi, who wants to foster a sense of community - highlighted as "co" in the project's name - by arranging perks for residents at local businesses.
"The thing that attracted us to the neighbourhood is the fact you have a great combination of the urban vibe along Kingston Road Village, the proximity to the Beach and you've got great schools and public open spaces. So it provides that balance between the urban amenities, but also family amenities."
Occupancy in the sustainable green building will begin in 2017.

A sheik's Canadian connection stays 'under the radar' in Dubai

Full text:   When Rino Sabatino tells people he heads up the industrial engine of Ras Al Khaimah, few people know what he's talking about.
But the Toronto native is now responsible for selling the world on the investment potential of this northernmost region of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) - a would-be oasis of manufacturing, pharmaceuticals and other industry that is home to about half a million people. He has also stepped in as investment adviser to the emirate's ruler, Sheik Saud Bin Saqr Al Qasimi.
Mr. Sabatino is a construction and investment specialist who cut his teeth at Tridel Enterprises Inc. where he served as vice-president of international business development. Now he hopes to attract big institutional players and other companies from Canada and around the world to the desert expanse of mountains and beaches located one hour north of Dubai, the most populous of the seven emirates. But first, he has to introduce himself.
"We have been developing deliberately under the radar. We're not Dubai, and we don't want to be Dubai," Mr. Sabatino said in an interview in Toronto, adding that few business people in the city have ever heard of Ras Al Khaimah.
The sheikdom is less saturated, expensive and bureaucratic than Dubai or UAE capital Abu Dhabi, he said, comparing it to municipalities around Toronto, such as Newmarket, Ont.
Mr. Sabatino first moved to Dubai with his wife Lucia more than eight years ago when he took a job as chief executive of Lootah Group, an industrial real estate conglomerate owned by a prominent local family in Dubai.
The mannerisms of chairman Ibrahim Sa'eed Lootah, reminded Mr. Sabatino of his own Italian father, who worked in the commercial building industry in Toronto.
Those were "crazy times" in the Middle Eastern real estate business, Mr. Sabatino said. Dubai's economic boom was led by many large family-owned enterprises, which he likened to the U.S. industrial revolution when the Carnegies, Mellons and Rockefellers drove progress.
"It was what I called the '-est of the world' - everything was 'the richest, the highest, the longest,'" Mr. Sabatino said. He began his role advising the Sheik, who studied economics at the University of Michigan, three months ago.
It's a different challenge. Ras Al Khaimah is seeking stability, rather than the glitz of Dubai. There are about 7,000 commercial businesses operating in the region, and the RAK Investment Authority plans to lease more raw land and warehouses to foreign businesses to build or distribute their products, with no corporate or individual tax, allowing 100 per cent repatriation of profits.
In some arrangements companies pay customs duties, in others they must have joint ownership structures. Businesses operating in the region include Indian commercial vehicle maker Ashok Leyland Ltd. and Auburn Hills, Mich.-based Guardian Industries Corp., which produces glass. It's also home to the world's largest ceramic manufacture, RAK Ceramics, which exports tile to about 200 countries.
"I'm bricks and mortar," Mr. Sabatino said, thumping a palm on the table. "You want the gold? You want Hermes and Gucci? It's an hour away. If you're a sophisticated business that wants to build, and wants support from a very pro-business government and ruler ... if you want a stable, long-term, boring investment? I'm the place to be."
Boring, maybe. But Ras Al Khaimah also wants a slice of Dubai's tourism - the palatial Hilton Waldorf Astoria hotel recently opened, and there are four man-made islands. Mr. Sabatino is working on finding a partner to develop one of the islands.
Mr. Sabatino is also seeking partners for a new power plant to help feed all the new development.
It is not always easy for a Westerner to work in the UAE, which requires some cultural sensitivity. Mr. Sabatino and his wife have made local friends, but socialize separately in their homes.
"We don't mingle, as is the custom," he said.

Abstract: [Ivan Orkin]'s calling card is his rye-flour noodles. They taste as though they're enriched with chestnuts: They're firm and almost meaty-tasting, springy like the really good stuff, deep-down satisfying. Orkin adds whole roasted tomatoes to his soup as well - the effect, against his classic soy and chicken broth, is bright and a little sour, sweet and hugely savoury. There isn't a single detail Orkin didn't think through.

Full text:   One food critic, five days in the greatest dining city on Earth: From Thai rotisseries to rye-flour ramen stands, the best spots in New York transcend time
The room was a world of its own making: confident and beautiful and captivating. You walked in from southern Manhattan's construction-hoarded skyscape - under the "Alimentari & Vineria" sign and through the doors and the light was suddenly warm and the walls were lined with hand-blown antique wine jeroboams from Italy.
The air smelled of roasting chicken and sizzling artichokes. A smiling server brought a glass of fizzy, strangely soulful lambrusco and crusty hot sourdough and little dishes of salt and olive oil. The chefs wore red cotton cycling caps with the brims flipped up, like old-time Giro d'Italia racers. Il Buco Alimentari e Vineria 's chefs cooked with a level of skill you just don't find in many other towns.
I had a plate of the razor clams. They'd been shucked and chopped and set back on their half-shells with olive oil and chilies and the juicy, softly floral pulp from finger limes. The lime pulp's pale translucent vesicles pop-popped tart and effervescent as you ate them, an epiphany against the chilies' spice and the clams' briny sweet.
The clams gave way to the greatest bowl of pasta I'd had in ages, and then to a juicy, assertively spicy half-chicken that had been marinated in harissa and brick-oven-roasted.
This was lunch on a Monday, the first stop on a five-day eating trip in which I hoped to discover some of the best new(ish) restaurants in New York. Of course that's a tall order. The city's scene is a perpetual 10,000 rpm churn of promise and success and failure and reinvention. The half-life of hotness here lasts approximately 31/4 weeks. But out of that churn comes way-out-of-the-ordinary restaurants. The best spots in New York suspend time and disbelief. They all have their own sense of place: only right now, exactly here.
As I was starting in on my pasta that afternoon, the couple at the next table met my eye. Their expressions said that they knew what I knew. They knew that Il Buco was one of those places. And that nothing feels more like getting away with murder than a long, boozy lunch in the greatest dining town on Earth.
Thailand by way of Thomas Keller
After dinner one night, a friend from the city was trying to explain how much New York's restaurant business has changed. It was nearly 10 p.m.; I was rushing off to a second meal. New York is overpopulated with 25-year-olds who spend their entire disposable incomes on restaurant cooking, he said.
Sure enough, 30 minutes later, Uncle Boons was rammed with proof of that. They drank cocktails and talked about real estate, table tennis and True Detective. They ate toasted coconut wrapped with lime and chilis and ginger in betel leaves and curries with pickled mustard greens.
Uncle Boons is a casual Thai rotisserie. It opened just more than a year ago near the Bowery, in Manhattan's Nolita neighbourhood. The room is decorated with Thai movie posters; its soundtrack runs from smoky-voiced Thai crooners to warbly funk. At the bar, a mechanical beer-chilling machine turns bottles of Chang lager into disconcertingly refreshing slushies.
Uncle Boons's two chef-owners - she from Northern Thailand, he from Long Island - met while working in the kitchen of Thomas Keller's Per Se, one of the top restaurants in the city. When you apply that level of training and talent to Thai food, it doesn't taste much like the Thai food most North Americans know.
The blowfish tails, fat and juicy with their fins still attached, were sweetly charred and bathed in coal smoke and perfumed with lime and garlic. I ate them with my fingers alongside grilled baby octopus, dipping them into complex green chili sauce, sweating and smiling like a maniac from the heat. I had sworn to myself that I wouldn't overdo it. Now I couldn't pull myself away from the mee krob: fried sweetbreads on a salad of crispy noodles, peanuts, herbs and tamarind.
Yet for me the killer dish was the rotisserie cabbage, a $6 side. The kitchen slow-roasts whole green cabbages until they are sweet and darkened in spots and nearly melted inside, and then quarters them, sousing the hunks with chili and fish-sauce-based nam prik and bombing them with deep-fried shallots and crispy shrimp. I can't say I've ever had anything like it. I haven't stopped thinking about it for a month.
The outsider effect
A lunch crowd was building in the food court. Gotham West Market is located far, far away from the usual dining strips. It's in Hell's Kitchen on Manhattan's distant West Side, a (gasp, if you're a New Yorker) 12-minute walk from the nearest subway stop.
The market is bright and cheery, with window light instead of dreary fluorescence. It's populated by independent restaurants and purveyors and even a "hand-crafted" coffee company - the sort of quality-obsessed entrepreneurs who've breathed new life into local, small-scale food production of late.
My prime destination was the stainless-steel counter facing Ivan Ramen Slurp Shop , a fresh-faced noodle-soup spot run by Ivan Orkin, a Long Island-born chef.
Smartly designed illustrations around the counter demonstrated the finer points of ramen-eating. The menu went one further. "Bring the noodles to your mouth and SLURP loudly!" it instructed.
"Find the rhythm of the noodle," it said.
Orkin's calling card is his rye-flour noodles. They taste as though they're enriched with chestnuts: They're firm and almost meaty-tasting, springy like the really good stuff, deep-down satisfying. Orkin adds whole roasted tomatoes to his soup as well - the effect, against his classic soy and chicken broth, is bright and a little sour, sweet and hugely savoury. There isn't a single detail Orkin didn't think through. New York has gone mad for the joint; a second Ivan Ramen opened earlier this month on the Lower East Side.
The Slurp Shop has a lot in common with many of the new-school restaurants and food shops that seem to be taking over the city these days: out of the way location, tiny, focused menu.
And though his restaurant feels every bit like something you'd only ever find in New York, Orkin is an outsider to the city: He opened his first ramen shop, proved his concept and made his name not here in New York, but in Tokyo, where to this day his noodles remain a cult favourite. Chefs and restaurants from outside New York - Mission Cantina, run by the San Francisco chef Danny Bowien, Oregon-based Pok Pok, and Toro, a buzzy new Spanish place, originally from Boston, are a few of the recent high-profile examples - have been having a good run in the city of late.
One night I ventured out to Greenpoint, Brooklyn - newly fashionable thanks to soaring real-estate prices elsewhere, but still far enough out of the way that it might as well be Indiana.
There I ate a superb meal at the counter of Luksus , a neo-Nordic spot run by Daniel Burns, a Halifax-raised chef. The restaurant is hidden in a tiny room at the back of a Danish-owned craft-beer bar. (Scrawled on the chalkboard sign out front: a drawing of Yoda, and the words, "Get beer you must.")
The room was packed. The restaurant critic at New York magazine, Adam Platt, named Luksus one of his 10 favourite new restaurants of 2013.
I had lambs' sweetbreads that had been fried like popcorn chicken and served in a craft paper cone with briny, hay-infused sauce gribiche, and skate poached in olive oil until it was wickedly moist, tender and mellow.
It was new-Nordic cooking (rye toasts; restrained seasoning; the same 10-pound, hand-thrown plates as at Noma) through a New York lens. My only complaint: Luksus's tasting menu is served with beer only; by the time that fish arrived I might have killed for a glass of wine.
Trickle-down food economics
Even in a city that thrives on extremes of money and scarcity, that proudly wears its badge as home to many of the world's most exclusive restaurants, it can all get to be too much sometimes.
I've never had to navigate as demanding a reservations department as the one at Little Elm , for instance, an eight-seat tasting-menu spot in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, where I had pretensions of eating at 6 p.m. on a Thursday night last month. To keep my booking, the restaurant required that I photocopy the front and back of my credit card and fax it to them, along with a signed release form. (Life is too short. I didn't bother.)
At Atera , an acclaimed, 24-course tasting-menu restaurant that's run by the chef Matthew Lightner, the most memorable things about my dinner were that a) the sommelier talked endlessly about his wines, and how rare they were, and what exactly they were going to taste like and where I should focus on my palate when I tasted them and why he'd paired them with what I was about to eat (the short answer: because he's a wine-pairing savant), and b) that everyone around me seemed to care more about the novelty of a restaurant serving 24 courses - count them, 24! - than about the actual food.
I was served a tiny duck's heart entombed in beeswax, a flower sculpture made from garlic and razor clams, a miniature lobster roll built into a meringue "bun," a piece of trout that tasted of pork, a course called "geoduck, lardo, air baguette." (Please tell me you just rolled your eyes.) Some of it was excellent. Most of it was overwrought: pretty but mediocre. Dinner for one with wine pairings cost $485 (U.S.).
Yet New York's splash-out restaurants can be unforgettably delicious, too. What I remember most about the 10-course, all-dessert tasting menu I ate early one evening at Per Se , Thomas Keller's gilded and linen-draped pleasure palace in the Time Warner Center, is how restrained and original and gorgeously balanced and beautifully plated those dishes were. (Even better, that tasting menu, available from 5:30 p.m. onwards to walk-ins only and also at lunchtime on weekends, is a steal at $70.)
The lunch I ate at Le Bernardin the last time I was in New York remains one of the greatest, most memorable meals of my life. Le Bernardin's cooking combined incredible ingredients, best-in-show technique and that other, rarest of kitchen elements - artistry - to a level I've never seen surpassed in another North American restaurant. It cost nearly $450 all-in for the full lunchtime tasting menu and wine pairings; it was expensive enough that I ate there alone while my (monumentally understanding) wife wandered around the city. I would do it all again in a second.
And all that talent from the high-end trickles down, not merely in the form of staff and new restaurateurs such as that couple from Uncle Boons, but also by helping to build an expectation of excellence at places where the silverware doesn't come from France.
It turns up at the city's most extraordinary wine bar - the East Village flagship of Terroir , the friendly, riesling-and-Madeira-obsessed flagship of a growing mini-chain that's run by a Torontonian named Paul Grieco.
It shows up at sandwich and coffee shops and vegetarian restaurants and bagel counters, and at Bouchon Bakery where the quiche, tall and jiggly and as tender as foie gras and sold by the slice, may be the single sexiest, most purely sublime expression the humble egg will ever achieve.
The trip ended the best way possible, with a long lunch in Lower Manhattan. This one was on Mulberry Street, where Little Italy brushes up against the Lower East Side and Chinatown. It was in a little room that's kept hidden behind lace curtains, that has polished wood benches and Italian-American groceries on the shelves around it, that's fronted by single-pane windows that might have been installed in the 1890s. On one of them, someone had painted in tidy red cursive, "Torrisi Italian Specialties."
I half-expected to find a canning party - two dozen nonnas making tomato sauce. Instead, there were just two other patrons. (Dinner reservations are significantly more difficult to come by; N.B., the reservations department is nowhere near as polished as the restaurant's floor staff.) It would be hard to overstate how lucky we were to have a world like this all to ourselves.
The chefs, Rich Torrisi and Mario Carbone, are products of the city. They trained under the best in the business: with Daniel Boulud and Mario Batali. Torrisi Italian Specialties first opened in 2009 as a sandwich shop. Today it is built around a $100, seven-course tasting - their tribute to the neighbourhood as a melting pot. (The restaurant, as with the city, is constantly being reinvented.) The wit and inventiveness and sense of place of the cooking that day blew my mind.
There was a note-perfect salmon tartare topped with cream cheese and salmon roe and served with "everything" blinis, a nod to the area's Jewish history. And a gossamer slice of lamb carpaccio dotted with chili oil, sided with a steamed bun in a bamboo basket. There was a fillet of trout done francese-style, breaded and fried with that classic Italian-American sauce of lemon, reduced wine and stock and butter, but made with four-star precision. The gnocchi - gnudi, really - made with sheep's-milk ricotta and chestnuts was one of the most time-stopping dishes I've had in my life.
Before dessert, they served a crystalline lemon ice in a tiny paper cup, like you might find in a 1950s scoop shop. That single gesture, the wit and humility and nostalgia, and yes, of course, the deliciousness of it, said everything you need to know about the restaurant.
I wished I never had to leave.

Full text:   For Canadians with a sense of adventure - or who simply prefer to relax in shorts and a T-shirt year-round - buying a vacation property outside the country makes a lot of sense, Kira Vermond writes. Here are a few areas to consider.
Belize
With its balmy weather, English-speaking locals, stable dollar and world-class diving, there's a lot to love about tiny Belize, located in Central America. While it's not cheap by Caribbean standards, there are no restrictions on foreign ownership of real estate and there are plenty of properties to choose from. A two-bedroom beachfront condo within walking distance of San Pedro Town for $220,000? Yes, please.
Puglia, Italy
Hilltop towns, shimmering ocean beaches and olive groves beckon in Italy's heel, particularly for those searching for a European property in which to relax. Best yet, Puglia real estate prices are generally lower than in Tuscany and Umbria. Right now, $390,000 is the asking price for a three-bedroom villa with a pool and sea view just outside Ostuni.
Tulum, Mexico
Tulum has it all: white-powder sand beaches, Mayan ruins and palm trees that remind you you're far from Canadian winters and work. While gaining in popularity, Cancun, just 130 kilometres away, still draws far more crowds. With new plans in the works to turn Tulum into a hopping tourist destination in the next decade, though, now is the time to buy a property.

Full text:   The generation 55 and up have real estate equity in Vancouver valued at $163.4-billion. Now they're buying high-end condos
kgold@globeandmail.com
When a real estate agent invited me for a tour of developer Boffo Development's new luxury downtown project called Artemisia, I assumed the buyers would be the same foreign clients that are driving so much of Vancouver's high-end market.
Not so, said agent Ben Amzaleg, who's selling the remaining units of the 21-unit townhouse and condo project at 1102 Hornby St. Three units are for sale, including two 1,800-square-foot townhouses for $1.6-million and $1.7-million, and a 2,500-square-foot penthouse for nearly $3-million. Another four units are also for sale, but they were purchased at the presale stage two years ago and are being re-sold by investor owners who've never lived there.
The buyers are overwhelmingly local mom-and-dad boomers and older who've cashed out of their west side homes to live in a flashy downtown pad. They are the generation that reaped the biggest rewards from Vancouver's global real estate economy, the one that was the topic of a recent New Yorker piece that said Vancouver is the most expensive real estate city in North America. Eight per cent of the condos in Vancouver have an assessed value of more than $1-million, according to Bing Thom Architects urban planner Andy Yan. Of those, 2 per cent are assessed at more than $5-million. The majority of the luxury condos are clustered around Coal Harbour, Yaletown, False Creek North, Point Grey and Kitsilano.
As boomers age, they are downsizing in upscale fashion, taking their equity from a modest west-side home and splurging on a low-maintenance condo not far from what they know. The Artemisia homes are high end enough to include TV screens recessed inside bathroom mirrors, automated blinds, giant crystal chandeliers and 30-foot cathedral ceilings.
"Two months ago I did a deal for a couple that lived in their house in West Vancouver for 30 years. He was still working as an academic. We ended up buying an 1,800-square-foot three-bedroom in Olympic Village," Mr. Amzaleg says. "They were attracted to the views and the amenities and the fact she doesn't need to drive so far any more. They took all that equity from their house in West Van and put it into a condo."
They are the new buyer demographic for luxury condos and they are unlike any that has come before. Unlike offshore buyers, they are not in it for an investment, but for the lifestyle.
They're not seeking a cookie cutter 500-square-foot one-bedroom for their kid to live in while they go to school, or to operate as a revolving-door rental until they sell it for a bit of a profit. This buyer wants the luxury of space, quality workmanship, top-end appliances, centrality, surrounding amenities that are walkable, generous parking and storage.
"I've noticed in the last two years it's the same exact story," says Mr. Amzaleg, who specializes in luxury condos. "Onni is building right on the corner of Pacific and Richards, The Charleson. And the entire building starts at around 1,300 square feet - all large homes. So no 500-square-foot one-bedrooms or 850-square-foot two-bedrooms. They are aiming for that specific older market.
"I think it was just the timing," he says. "In the next 10 or so years [boomer buyers] will be too old to go up the stairs, so they want to move. Don't get me wrong. It's very tough for them. A lot of them still have the objection of, 'Where will I put my living room?' because they are coming from very large spaces. So I'm dealing with a lot of objections over how to move a house into condo living. Even though it's 1,500 square feet, it still doesn't feel like enough for them. But I think it's a mental switch."
Veteran broadcaster Red Robinson owned a 4,500-square-foot waterfront house in Deep Cove before he and his wife, Carole, downsized to a condo. With the kids grown and married off, they didn't need the space or the hassle of living outside downtown. They initially rented a Coal Harbour condo to give it a try, but found it isolating. So they purchased a condo at the foot of Hornby Street with a waterfront view, and with several friends already in the building.
"We didn't have that sense of community in Coal Harbour," Mr. Robinson says. "Now, we're in Yaletown and there are more lights burning in the windows at night. Our building is 10 storeys and solid as a rock. We've got 1,800 square feet. We needed space - I can't live in an 800-square-foot joint.
"And we're city folks. We love the city. We don't want to live in Qualicum Beach like some of our friends. We couldn't handle it. We go to the art gallery, the symphony and sports games. We want to be downtown and walk to these places."
For an agent, this market means extra work. And for a developer, they mean extra risk, partly because they're not as likely to buy into a presale.
"It's a longer sales process," Mr. Amzaleg says. "They do not buy a condo on the first go. They are going to come two, three, four, five times. They are going to circle the neighbourhood, because this is all new territory for them. So for developers it might not be as appealing as selling out a building in three months.
"Because they are all end users, the sales process is completely different. It's way slower and they are way more picky on finishing options and small stuff."
Bob Rennie, real estate marketer and owner of Rennie Marketing Systems, spoke about the new market in his annual Urban Development Institute speech last week. He said people 55 and older have real estate equity in Greater Vancouver valued at $163.4-billion. That's a gold mine for marketers, which is why there is a sudden flurry in the development of more spacious two- and three-bedroom condos instead of the usual cramped spaces.
Mr. Rennie says there's even been a sudden switch in design at the Binning Tower at the University of B.C. in reaction to the new market. The project is in the presale stage, aimed at boomers in the area who will sell their houses for a few million. A luxury condo - as long as it's large - will hopefully look like an affordable option. The downsizing market needs plenty of storage.
"At the Binning Tower at UBC, we can't sell the one bedrooms, so we are amalgamating them into two bedrooms and three bedrooms," Mr. Rennie says. "That $1.3- to $1.7-million is about space, luxury, big decks and great kitchens."
One hurdle is the fact that most projects depend on presales for upfront financing. For a senior, or anyone else who is risk averse, the idea of making a home purchase before it's built is unappealing. Only big developers with extremely deep pockets can afford the financial outlay of the "build it and they will come" approach.
But Mr. Rennie is more hopeful that the market will become more comfortable with presales.
"Banks won't finance you without presales unless the developer is funding it himself, so there is risk," he says. "But we are a presale city and I think these buyers have already become attuned to it."
Mr. Rennie agrees it's a buyer demographic that calls for a different way of doing business. They will take their time, peruse their options, seek out the best value and maybe research the developer. In other words, they aren't an easy sell compared with the first-time buyer or the investor. This is about selling homes for settling down.
"The agents will do what I did when I started out," Mr. Rennie says. "We sat in the White Spot and had coffee and a piece of pie and we talked with the client. Agents better get used to eating pie and drinking coffee.
"And they will need to get to know the clients' names."

Tall building romance, plus park

Author: John Bentley Mays

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/tall-building-romance-plus-park/docview/1527317393/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Newer, taller condo stacks may loom over the Wellesley Street tower. But until that happens - which it could, since 60 storeys is no longer extraordinarily high in Toronto - Mr. [Bruce Kuwabara]'s softly fluid tower in the park will provide an architectural as well as communal focus for its currently unfocused spot in the Yonge Street corridor.

Full text:   Architect Bruce Kuwabara and landscape designer Robert Ng make a welcome addition to the Yonge Street corridor
jmays@globeandmail.com
Toronto has never had the parkland it deserves. That we have any sizable green spaces at all is largely because of the Victorian philanthropy of John Howard, who willed us his country estate, now High Park, and to the numerous streams and little rivers that prevent the occupation of their marshy, forested ravines.
Waterfront Toronto, the public agency charged with the revitalization of Hogtown's desolate Lake Ontario shoreline, is laying out impressive parks on the properties it oversees, but private-sector real estate interests seem as intent as ever on building out every square foot of land that's available.
Which is one thing that makes the upcoming infill of the spacious vacant lot on Wellesley Street just west of Yonge Street different, and interesting.
In a notable exception to what usually happens, Lanterra Developments, the owner, will create a 1.6-acre public park on the site. To be crafted by Robert Ng of NAK Design Group, this park will satisfy, at least part way, the desire of politicians, city planning staff and local residents that the empty lot not be crammed with architecture. The neighbours will get the landscaped open space they want in this tight inner-city jumble of apartment blocks and the tattoo parlours and pizza joints of Yonge Street.
Lanterra has landed permission to put up a 60-storey commercial-residential tower on the northeast corner of the site. The developer will get the $300-million, profit-making building needed to suit the backers and make its fashioning of the park work financially.
On the inside, this structure will offer standard-issue condo living to the usual downtown home-hunters - singles, working couples without kids, empty-nesters, investors. Prices for the tower's 742 units start at around $200,000 for a tiny 300-square-foot studio. At 878 square feet, the largest suite available features two bedrooms and a den - perhaps enough territory for a very small family, though not really. It looks like we'll have to keep waiting for a developer to issue a serious invitation to normal-income, normal-sized families to live deep downtown.
But if the neighbours get a new park out of this arrangement, and Lanterra gets its high-rise, what will be the payoff for people who care about beauty? It could be conspicuous, if the tower lives up to its model and renderings.
Designed for Lanterra by Bruce Kuwabara, founding partner of KPMB Architects, in close co-operation with Page+Steele/IBI Group Architects, this attractive building takes its artistic cues, Mr. Kuwabara says, from landscape.
Not the stony, dramatic terrain of Ontario's cottage country, it appears, but rather the mellow, rolling farmland in the province's southern districts, and the hilly contours of the proposed park. Belts of whitened glass balcony fronts run smoothly around each level of the structure, quietly looping out at the curved corners, then tucking in, and nowhere making a sharp turn. The billowing white exterior, almost invisibly accented by shades of grey, will be subtly expressive instead of routinely right-angled.
The undulation is most pronounced at the ground level, where the terraced base flares out over the outside tables of what Mr. Kuwabara hopes will be a noodle house, a French bistro or some other casually chic, mid-market venue. His belief that a fine-dining establishment would be out of place in this zone of the city is surely right. What's wanted, instead, is a hub, a popular eatery that lends social orientation to the neighbourhood of high-rise dwellers and strollers on rough-edged Yonge Street.
This description doesn't make this building sound very much like the KPMB structures Torontonians are used to.
For most of its 26 years, the distinguished office has seemed most comfortable doing straight-ahead, anti-historicist modernism. Neither its recent overhauls of the Gardiner Museum of Ceramic Art and the Royal Conservatory of Music nor its ground-up residential performances at the mammoth CityPlace housing complex dropped a hint that KPMB might have a place in its artistic toolkit for the tall-building romanticism embodied in the Wellesley Street project.
But this enlargement is surely welcome. Like other local designers of large condominium buildings in the Toronto market - David Pontarini and Rosario Varacalli come to mind - Mr. Kuwabara has clearly been thinking about what comes next in the art of building tall, now that every modernist box has been constructed and every application of the T-square has been explored.
Newer, taller condo stacks may loom over the Wellesley Street tower. But until that happens - which it could, since 60 storeys is no longer extraordinarily high in Toronto - Mr. Kuwabara's softly fluid tower in the park will provide an architectural as well as communal focus for its currently unfocused spot in the Yonge Street corridor.

For years, a derelict seniors home on St. Clair Avenue sat across the street in stark contrast to a vibrant 21-acre park with 10 tennis courts, a jogging path, ravine trail, off-leash dog run and playground.
So developer - and former Forest Hill native - Brian Brown of BLVD Developments and Lifetime Developments made it a personal mission to replace the eyesore with an upscale residence worthy of its location on Sir Winston Churchill Park.
"The park is one of the largest city central parks we have in Toronto, so to be able to position a building across from a park is a rare opportunity, and what it affords you is not just the amenities that come with the park, but the views," says Mr. Brown, who launched the infill project this spring.
"The views looking south from this property will always be protected and unobstructed, and even looking north, there are low-rise homes of Forest Hill, so again we have very protected views."
Locals closely guard the community as well, so they were included in Hariri Pontarini Architects' design of this nine-storey condominium at the corner of St. Clair and Parkwood avenues, near Spadina Road.
"There are not a lot of redevelopment opportunities in the neighbourhood itself," Mr. Brown says.
"[The developers] were talking about how the postal code represents some of the most exclusive - and a lot of cases notable - residences in the city, so to name the building The Code felt very appropriate."
The area is also well-known for its boutiques and restaurants in Forest Hill Village and elite schools, such as Forest Hill C.I., Bishop Strachan School, Upper Canada College and St. Michael's College School.
"When you build in a mature neighbourhood like Forest Hill, the neighbourhood itself is the amenity," Mr. Brown said.
"Being able to walk out your door and walk along the private residential, tree-lined streets of Forest Hill is something you can't get downtown, and the schools located around this property are some of the top private schools and even public schools in the city."
Should residents need to commute further, it will be easy. "It's got the LRT right at its doorstop and the subway is two minutes away at the Loblaws, which is amazing with 66,000 square feet. It's one of their largest and flagship locations."
When the mid-rise is completed by June, 2016, residents of just 108 units and 10 townhouses will share use of a pet washing station, gym, lounge and terrace.
"There's a relaxed and friendly feeling to the building," Mr. Brown said. "You get familiar with whose in the building because there are fewer people to see."
Buyers can select from studios to three-bedroom-plus-den suites with balconies or terraces and townhouses with private patios and interior building access.
"We cater to a very broad group - both people downsizing from larger homes of Forest Hill or people who have wanted to live in Forest Hill but couldn't afford it before," Mr. Brown said.
"We terraced the building to the north, so each floor has a number of suites that have expanded outdoor terrace space larger than we typically provide with a balcony."
Units will be given nine-foot ceilings, full height windows and engineered floors, as well as custom cabinetry by Tomas Pearce Interior Design Consulting Inc., composite stone counters and Energy Star laundry machines.
Parking will be $50,000 and monthly fees 53 cents per square foot, plus separately metered hydro.

Full text:   The Bazinga social network helps residents organize events, talk about local issues and ask for advice
REAL ESTATE REPORTER
You've got Facebook for friends and LinkedIn for work associates. Now Joseph Nakhla thinks you need a social network for your neighbours.
The 40-year-old Vancouver resident is the founder of Bazinga, which is designed to help neighbours connect to one another and to local resources.
Mr. Nakhla says he was inspired by his childhood in Egypt, where he grew up in a low-rise complex with five apartments. The people in those apartments helped each other out on a regular basis and grew close.
"I really felt a sense of community," he says. It's something that he thinks is generally lacking in Canada's big cities. "I have a lot of friends that moved to Vancouver from other parts of the country that say it's tough to meet people, and I've heard it in Toronto."
Launched at the end of 2012, Bazinga enables all of the residents in a condo building or gated community or other form of neighbourhood to interact online. The social network has areas where residents can organize events or talk about local issues or ask for advice, and it also allows them to send private messages. People are using it to do things like set up potluck dinners and barbecues, share decorating ideas, and band together to lobby for local issues or talk about problems in their buildings.
The network also allows the developer or property manager to communicate with residents, and to upload a flood of documents, from notes from a condo board meeting to the owner's manual for the microwaves.
At the moment about 400 communities or buildings are signed up, representing about 80,000 homes, Mr. Nakhla says. Its biggest market so far is Toronto, followed by Vancouver. Mr. Nakhla says his company has "good" revenues, but is not turning a profit yet.
For now, developers, property managers, strata or condo boards pay to sign up and then residents can access the network for free.
Mr. Nakhla says Bazinga is more than just social. "There are all kinds of complaints about condo living and apartment living - logistical challenges, getting a hold of your property manager, you've got concierges and people that own the units and people that are renting - it's a pretty complex ecosystem. So I looked at it and thought, 'Man, wouldn't it be great to have a platform that brings everybody in.'"
Undoubtedly, there are many people who prefer to remain anonymous within their buildings, and who don't want another social network.
"We've seen everything," Mr. Nakhla says.
"We've seen people that are exceptionally social and put an avatar of themselves up, put their profession on there, put information about themselves. And we've also seen people that just put their initials."
For those who prefer not to interact with their neighbours, instead of getting up at 2 a.m. to pound on the door down the hall because the music's too loud, now they can make their feelings known from their smartphone.

David Berman writes for Inside the Market (tgam.ca/inside-the-market), which offers up-to-the-minute analysis of stock trends and market-moving news throughout the trading day.
China has a problem: It is losing its supporters.
As the country's once-stellar economic growth slows to levels once deemed unacceptable among economists, a number of investors had been maintaining bullish views on the country and its long-term potential.
Now, some of these views are starting to shift, raising concerns that the former engine of the global economy is becoming one of its key risks.
Mark Mobius, manager of the Templeton Emerging Markets Fund and for decades one of the top names in global investing, has lowered his exposure to China to below 16 per cent, as of the end of March.
That's down significantly from a weighting of more than 22 per cent a year ago and below China's 18.5-per-cent weighting in the benchmark MSCI Emerging Markets Index.
As well, none of the top 10 holdings in Mr. Mobius's fund are based in China, versus four Chinese companies that crack the index's top 10.
To be sure, China has long attracted its share of skeptics who saw a toxic mix of local-government debt, entrenched corruption and massive overbuilding.
For example, famed short-seller Jim Chanos of Kynikos Associates has been warning of a real estate bubble in China since 2009 and has been betting against Chinese banks.
China's stock market has been feeding much of the broader investor skepticism. The Shanghai stock exchange composite index has fallen more than 40 per cent since 2009 and is no higher today that it was six years ago. Investors have been pulling money out of Chinese equity funds at a brisk pace, suggesting that small investors are losing patience.
But now, China is even starting to weigh on the optimists.
"Over the past year, we've written that Chinese growth was more stable than the market believed," said strategists at Pavilion Global Markets, in a note. "Over the past several months, however, we've grown increasingly concerned that the housing pillar is becoming shakier."
The strategists contend that China's property market is much more difficult to manage than many of the country's other financial challenges. Price increases within leading cities are slowing, which suggests that property growth has peaked. Among less-developed cities, prices are rising at an even slower pace.
Things could get worse: Sales volume has fallen 19 per cent over last year and "floor space" construction has fallen 23 per cent, according to The Wall Street Journal.
"To be clear, our view is not that this is China's property bubble day of reckoning and that prices will never accelerate again," the Pavilion strategists said. "Rather, we feel we have reached a downturn in this highly cyclical property market."
That raises two big concerns.
First, the property market has deep ties to China's financial sector - local governments rely upon property to repay debt and the banks accept it as collateral - which means that a sharp downturn will raise the chances of wider financial instability.
Policy makers can help alleviate the situation, but their choices aren't good ones. Broad support will hurt the credibility of recent financial reforms, while supporting only the more important financial institutions will make any rescue look disorderly.
Second, the Pavilion strategists believe that a property market downturn will affect China's broader economic growth. That's because 13 per cent of urban workers are employed in the construction sector and urban residential investment accounts for nearly 12 per cent of China's gross domestic product.
"One of the pillars of our view over the year has been that property was still growing strongly and that it would help stabilize growth," the strategists said.
"A downturn in property changes that tailwind into a headwind."

A persistent financial fallacy of our time is that you financially maim yourself by renting rather than owning a home. In fact, a renter who invests diligently can do very well financially, too.
Here's a Q & A guide to make it happen:
What am I trying to achieve?
Homeowners build wealth by paying their mortgage down and increasing their equity in a house that they will presumably be able to sell for more than they paid. Renters build wealth by taking the money they save through not owning - let's call this the renter's dividend - and investing it in a diversified portfolio. The value of these investments is like an owner's equity in his or her home.
Can't I just spend my savings as a renter?
Sure, but recognize that you put yourself at a financial disadvantage. A homeowner with a paid-off house has the luxury of choosing to:
* continue living mortgage-free in the home (and rent-free, for that matter);
* downsizing to a condo or smaller house and possibly having money left over for investing or personal spending;
* selling and moving to a rental, thereby freeing up hundreds of thousands of dollars in capital;
* selling and using the proceeds from the sale to cover the cost of moving into a retirement home.
Spend your renter's dividend instead of investing it and you face a poorer retirement with fewer options.
What if I'm just renting for a few years before buying a house?
Then your renter's dividend becomes your down payment. Be sure to park your savings in a high-interest savings account to protect your principal.
How much should I invest?
(Part 1)
Monthly rents and mortgage payments aren't far apart in some cases, but that's a false comparison because owners must cover the additional costs of property taxes, maintenance, improvements, furnishings and house-sized utility bills. It's these expenditures that renters should look at in deciding how much to invest.
How much should I invest?
(Part 2)
Okay, so you're going to invest the money you save by not owning a house. A rough guideline is that home maintenance and upkeep would have cost you an average 1 per cent of the value of your home over the years. Add in property taxes and the cost of discretionary home improvements and you're up to 1.5 or even 2 per cent of a home's value, on average, each year.
We'll go with 1.5 per cent in this exercise. Next question - what house price do we apply this savings/investing rate to? You could use local housing prices, which would have Toronto, Calgary and Vancouver renters saving vastly more than those in smaller towns. The risk here is that residents of smaller communities end up undersaving.
Another approach is to use the national average housing price, which in April was $409,708. Investing 1.5 per cent of that amount would mean monthly amounts of $512; at the more aggressive 2 per cent savings rate, the monthly investment amount rises to $683.
What if I can't invest that much?
With many people, the rationale for renting is that they can't afford a house in the community where they want to live. In that case, investing the full renter's dividend won't be realistic. Try tapering back to 1 per cent of home prices, or less if necessary.
Where should I invest?
To avoid paying taxes on your investment income as much as possible, make maximum use of tax-free savings accounts. To defer taxes until retirement, invest in a registered retirement savings plan. If you invest in a non-registered account, be mindful that bond interest is taxed as regular income, while dividends and capital gains are taxed more lightly. Homeowners have an advantage here in that they can sell a principal residence tax-free.
Should taxes play a role in my investing?
Yes. Think about squeezing your bond allocation below where you might otherwise be, especially if you have 10-plus years to go until you plan to dip into your investments. A 30-year-old renter might have as little as 10 or 20 per cent in bonds (I'll discuss mixing stocks and bonds for young investors in a future column).
If you hold stocks for the long term, keep in mind that 50 per cent of your capital gains are taxable. Many mutual funds and exchange-traded funds pay distributions that include a return of capital, which is basically a sliver of the upfront amount you invested. A return of capital is not taxed when received, but it does lower the adjusted cost base for an investment and thus increase the potential capital gain on sale.
How do I stay committed?
Whether you're a renter or an everyday investor, there's only one way to set up a disciplined investing program. You need to have money transferred electronically into your investment account from your chequing account every time you get paid, or once per month.
Do I have to invest separately for retirement?
Just as a homeowner needs to have dedicated savings for retirement, so does the renter. Ideally, you devote 10 per cent of your gross pay to retirement and other savings goals, and then invest your renter's dividend as well.
What kind of return should I expect?
Six per cent after fees is a reasonable expectation from a diversified portfolio with a heavy stocks weighting, but a little more may be attainable. The low-cost Mawer Tax Effective Balanced Fund has averaged 8 per cent annually over the past 20 years. This fund, designed for people investing outside registered accounts, is one of several funds I mentioned in a previous column (tgam.ca/ECVT) because their returns have exceeded the long-term national average price gain for houses in Canada.

RENTER'S REVENGE
A homeowner with a paid off house is sitting on a valuable asset, but not a very liquid one. The long-term renter who invests money saved by not owning ends up with a pile of money that can be used for anything, and at any time. Here's an example of how a renter can generate significant wealth. Note: These are after-fee, pre-tax returns. Taxes would reduce these numbers in non-registered accounts.

BUILDER/ DEVELOPER Streetcar Developments
SIZE 485 to 751 square feet . PRICE $288,900 to $382,000
SALES CENTRE 8 Gladstone Ave., north of Queen Street West. Open Monday to Thursday from noon to 6 p. m.; weekends from noon to 5 p. m.
CONTACT Phone 416-690-9009 or visit 20gladstone.com
Streetcar Development's latest downtown development will put residents within steps of boutique shops, restaurants, galleries, cultural and musical outposts in Queen West. But buyers in the fourth and final phase will have the luxury of taking their walks sheltered from inclement weather.
This seven-storey residence will have commercial space at its base and underground access to shops, studios and supermarket anchoring sister buildings within the master-planned project at the corner of Queen and Dufferin streets.
" There isn't anything quite like what we're doing in the westend area," says vice-president of sales and marketing, Alie Warren, who cites nearly 90 per cent of the 113 units have sold in the mid-rise Twenty, named after its address on Gladstone Avenue.
" The Carnaby will have interior access to the Metro, as will Twenty, but 2 and 8 Gladstone do not since they were built prior to the rest of the property coming online."
However, these buildings will also have retail spots facing inward toward a central pedestrian-and cyclist-friendly row with paths exiting to Gladstone Avenue and a new park along Dufferin Street to the east and west respectively.
" In other master-planned [ communities], like in Europe, it's a very common feature to have these rows or laneways that are really vibrant and focused on retail to bring residents down, so it's not just being about cars," Ms. Warren adds.
" It will draw in the community versus being its own blocked-off plot of land that only people who live within those buildings will have access to."
While the developer hopes locals will venture into the infill site, residents will also have sole use of amenities in the third phase.
Designed by Seven Haus, there will be a fitness centre with cardio, weight and yoga areas, a juice bar, party, games and media lounges, as well as a rooftop terrace with barbecue and dining facilities.
" You're getting all the big, high-rise amenities in a little boutique building," Ms. Warren says. " It's an extension of an already great, vibrant West Queen West neighbourhood."
To remain respectful of the existing streetscape, TACT Architecture conceived a contemporary envelope with brick, terracotta, metal, concrete, glass and steel materials punctuated with terraces and balconies.
Inside, one and two-bedroom suites will have open-concept principal rooms appointed ninefoot ceilings, exposed concrete pillars, hardwood floors and frosted-glass sliding doors, plus high-gloss European cabinetry, granite and Caesarstone counters and backsplashes.
" We've got some smaller units, so the prince points are more manageable for people - both investors and end users," Ms. Warren adds.
" A lot of people are drawn to the one-bedroom plus den or two-bedrooms, especially for professionals who want to work at home or have a guest room ... or those that want to rent out the unit."
Monthly fees will be 50 cents a square foot. Parking will be $30,000 and bike lockers $500.
Occupancy is slated for spring 2016.
Twenty will have retail spots facing inward toward a central row in the master-planned project at Queen and Dufferin.

Private investors trump public shareholders when it comes to the plum assets going on the market.
Power lines in Alberta, shopping malls in Toronto and even satellites in space are selling at prices that drive home just how much more big institutions with long-term views are willing to pay for assets than public markets.
Expect to see more sales. For governments such as Ontario that are short on cash, the prices that pension funds and their ilk are willing to pay are going to be very tantalizing, luring more assets onto the market. And public companies whose shareholders are not giving them commensurate credit for the infrastructure assets they own are going to meet up with buyers to take advantage of the mismatch.
The $3.2-billion sale of Alberta power distributor AltaLink to Warren Buffett's power group last week was far in excess of what most anyone thought the power distributor would fetch. And late last year, the sale of the Bayview Village mall in Toronto to British Columbia's provincial pension plan manager set a new high-water mark for real estate valuations. On the final frontier, the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan is said to be getting ready to pay $7-billion (U.S.) to purchase all of Telesat Holdings Inc. to harness the cash flow from its fleet of satellites.
In all these cases, only a big institution thinking in terms of decades can pay up. Mr. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway is technically public, but it has a lot more in common with pension funds. It does not require funding from public markets, and its time horizon is very long. An initial public offering of AltaLink got a look, but the valuations were not there.
What sticks out in the case of AltaLink is the fact that Berkshire Hathaway outbid Canada's big pension plans, which were circling the auction run by AltaLink seller SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. Canada's largest pension plans have been willing to pay more than almost anyone for prize assets. The AltaLink transaction, if one believes in Mr. Buffett's acumen, is a ratification of what the likes of Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Teachers have been willing to pay for assets that they deem indispensable and hard-to-replace infrastructure that will provide cash flow for decades to come.
There are many implications from the huge prices. The first is that governments in need of cash will be very tempted to offer up more assets. Ontario's Hydro One power distribution system seems a prime candidate. The governing Liberals are looking at asset sales, and the rival Progressive Conservatives will be looking to do the same should they prevail in the coming provincial election. Toronto politicians in the mayoral race have mused about selling the local city-owned distribution system.
The second is that public markets are likely to remain second fiddle for some time. Just as an IPO of AltaLink could not compete with a private sale, any other infrastructure and real estate assets that come on the market are likely to go into private hands. An IPO of Telesat has been mooted, but a private sale now appears more likely. And when SNC goes ahead with the sale of its stake in the 407 toll highway across the Toronto region, pension funds are sure to be the lead bidders.
It's not clear when public markets can get back in the game. Investors spooked by the possibility that interest rates may be headed up have stopped driving up stocks of companies in the public markets in sectors such as real estate and power transmission.
Real estate investment trusts, for example, have been sidelined by a selloff in their stocks and cannot compete with private buyers. Broadly, valuations in commercial real estate have basically flat-lined for the past year. Meantime, REITs are trading below their highs even after a rally in 2014.
The result is stark. Thus far in 2014, there has been $1.2-billion (Canadian) of mergers and acquisitions by Canadian REITs, a huge drop from the $10.8-billion that was announced in the same period in 2013.
Public investors are just not willing to look 10 or 20 years down the road. They are more than willing to be sellers at these prices, but they are too skeptical to buy. Until that changes, or pension funds are proven wrong in their assumptions about how well these assets will perform, the big institutions will dominate when long-lived assets come on the market.

Full text:   Canadian Real Estate Association to release data Thursday expected to show gains, boosted by tight supply
REAL ESTATE REPORTER
The Canadian Real Estate Association will be releasing April's housing data on Thursday, and the report is expected to show that prices are strong even though sales have been lacklustre.
"Price gains remain firm in much of the country, with average prices expected to be up about 6 per cent year-over-year, steady from the prior month," Bank of Montreal economist Benjamin Reitzes wrote in a research note.
"The quality-adjusted MLS house price index, a better representation of market conditions, looks to accelerate to 5.4 per cent year-over-year, a 29-month high," he added. (The MLS home price index, released by CREA, adjusts for changes in the types and locations of dwellings that are selling in an attempt to create a more accurate measure of underlying prices than the average price, which could be swayed if, for example, an expensive neighbourhood suddenly became more popular.)
CREA, which represents real estate agents, gathers MLS information each month from local real estate boards across the country and then discloses the national numbers. Some of the local boards have already disclosed April's numbers. The average selling price in Edmonton was up 4.5 per cent from a year ago, to $365,045; Toronto's average selling price rose 10.1 per cent to $577,898; Ottawa's average price ticked up 0.8 per cent to $374,015; Regina's remained relatively flat, at $317,176.
"Prices continue to rise despite cooling activity, reflecting relatively tight supply in major markets," Mr. Reitzes wrote. He, like many economists, questions whether the price momentum can be sustained. "Pricing tends to lag sales, so we could see prices come under mild pressure toward the middle of the year," he wrote.
He predicts that the number of existing homes that sold via the Multiple Listing Service in April will be about 2 per cent higher than a year earlier. If he's right, that would leave sales a little bit higher than they were in March, and would make April the third month in a row of sales gains after five consecutive monthly declines.
Toronto's volume of sales for April was up 1.8 per cent from a year earlier, Regina's and Vancouver's were each up about 16 per cent, and Montreal and Ottawa's each fell by about 9 per cent.

Full text:   Saucier + Perrotte's latest phase at River City expands the meaning of the apartment block as an urban architectural type
jmays@globeandmail.com
It has been four years since Toronto's Urban Capital Property Group rolled out the 950-unit residential complex known as River City. From that time to this, lead designers Gilles Saucier and André Perrotte, partners in the Montreal firm of Saucier + Perrotte, have been handing Hogtown one surprise after another.
The first was the 14-storey building that stands at the north end of the project's long rectangular site in once-desolate brownfields beside the Don River. Contradicting almost every expectation of what a Toronto condo ensemble should look like, River City 1 is dark, retiring, instead of shiny and glassy. It is laid out on an irregular pentagonal plan and is slope-sided, instead of being shaped like a cereal box or milk jug, or some variation thereon. Mr. Saucier calls it "a black art object, something with materiality that will look very strong and expressive on the site."
The second surprise was the office's proposal for the next phase. In contrast to the black structure it stands beside, this group of sculpted, linked blocks is white and gleaming. "We wanted to express the idea of light, reflection, living in the open landscape, without any skin covering it," Mr. Saucier told me. "Each apartment is the expression of individuality .... Each is a living element you pile up to create complexity."
But the story so far of River City - dark, reserved phase one followed by bright and punchy phase two - had not quite prepared us for the most vivid surprise of all: the 28-storey tower of phase three, which will go up immediately south of the elevated roadway that cuts across the site and flies over the Don River. If a rendering can be believed, Saucier + Perrotte's mid-sized building will be among the most artistically exciting high-rises constructed in Toronto since the onset of the condo boom.
Viewed from a point south of both flyover and tower, somewhere in the new adjacent park - the handiwork of Waterfront Toronto, the public agency developing this part of the West Don Lands - River City 3 will appear to be a black, heavily corroded oblong standing tall in the midst of lower housing round about. This side of the building will be dark and assertive, like the first phase of River City.
And its textured façade will reflect and freshly interpret the long-standing interest of Mr. Saucier and Mr. Perrotte in the effects of wind and water on stone, and in the natural forces that sculpt the earth, creating places and landscapes from the raw stuff of geology.
Moving around the structure to its north side, however, the observer will find that something bold and remarkable has happened to the black monolith. Light-framed residential units that seemed (from the other side) to be neatly stacked up, one atop the other in an orderly, conventional manner, come loose high up on the tower wall. They thrust out and pull in irregularly, as if they are small drawers opening and shutting in a tall bureau.
But toward the bottom of the façade, the drawers explode from the north side of the chest, pushing toward the highway and the earlier phases of River City, gouging into space far beyond the limits of the monolith's central shaft.
The result of all this visual commotion, with its eroding and pushing and pulling, should be a building with appealing vivacity. Like Beijing architect Yansong Ma's curvaceous Absolute towers in Mississauga, River City 3 expands the meaning of the apartment block as an urban architectural type, and encourages a fresh design direction for architects and developers working in the local real-estate market.
As should be clear from River City 3 and some other residential projects I've noticed around the city recently - including Saucier + Perrotte's Thompson Residences, nearing completion on King Street West - the leading-edge notion in residential block design at the moment is the breakup of the slab and box. Rather than merely piling up identical units neatly, one exactly on top of another, some architects are breaking out individual apartments from the sober-sided framework of the typical modern building. Each suite that gets this treatment stands out from all the others in the stack. It acquires its own visual identity, a unique address.
The idea is not new: Moshe Safdie led the way decades ago, by strongly articulating units of housing in Habitat, which he fashioned for Montreal's Expo 67. But, if all goes according to plan, River City 3 will mark a notable translation of the strategy from mid-rise to high-rise conditions. Like every other huge agglomeration of people that is officially trying not to sprawl, Toronto needs high-density residences to shelter its multitudes. The outstanding architecture of River City shows that even massive urban housing schemes can celebrate and express the individuality everyone needs in order to survive the big-city pressure to become bland, packaged, generic.

Full text:   Surrey truck driver Gurpal Dhillon comes home from work, picks up the phone and dials a number in India - where the battle for the world's largest democracy is under way. Somebody answers the phone and Mr. Dhillon begins to talk about the Aam Aadmi, or "Common Man" Party, which is campaigning with an anti-corruption platform.
Mr. Dhillon and other Indo-Canadians in Metro Vancouver are pitching in to urge contacts in India to get out and vote, and also to encourage others in Canada to help out with campaign donations. The hotly contested vote, which began April 7, will end next Monday. Results will be announced May 16.
Aditya Tawatia, an organizer for Overseas Friends of BJP, which supports the party largely expected to win the election, said organizers in Canada have influence in India. "We live in a very big and developed country ... when we talk, people in India listen."
Mr. Dhillon, one of 50 or so volunteers with the Aam Aadmi Party's B.C. support group, said he tries to make several calls each evening. Aam Aadmi Party supporters around the world have access to a database of Indian phone numbers collected by the party in India and assembled on its website.
Mr. Dhillon said the party's secular values and anti-corruption policies appeal to many people in the West. "We have supporters who are very old, as well as some supporters who are born in Canada and have only been to India once or twice. They've been born and bred right here in Canada but they still like the secular values of this party and they're supporting it," he said.
Mr. Dhillon said local Indo-Canadians have assisted "by calling their relatives and friends in India and impressing upon them the idea that it's time to try a different political party."
The group organized a convention in Surrey in February which drew a crowd of several hundred people, and they had a booth at the Vaisakhi parades last month in Surrey and Vancouver, where they handed out pamphlets and T-shirts with the Aam Aadmi logo.
The group has also encouraged Indians in B.C. who do not have Canadian citizenship to donate funds to the Aam Aadmi Party through their website. India does not allow dual citizenship, and only those with a valid Indian passport can donate money to political parties in the country.
Canada currently ranks third in donations to the Aam Aadmi Party from outside India - more than $170,000 has been donated by non-resident Indians in Canada.
The right-wing nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) also has a faithful following in the Lower Mainland.
Mr. Tawatia, a local real estate agent and president of the Vancouver chapter of the Overseas Friends of BJP, said he and other members use their social and business networks in the Indo-Canadian community to spread awareness of the party.
"Our role is just to talk to people, to let them know about BJP in India, and if they can ask their friends and their relatives to vote for BJP in India."
Mr. Tawatia said BJP prime ministerial nominee Narendra Modi "makes things happen."
Praveen Goel, another member of the Overseas Friends of BJP in Vancouver, said he uses social media to communicate with friends and family in India. He said the group's purpose is to educate people based on what it can see from an outside perspective of Indian politics.
"We all have ties back home, and we talk to people and we are in many ways leaders and people listen to us."
Mr. Tawatia and Mr. Goel believe a BJP government would mean better business opportunities between the nations - and between India and British Columbia specifically.
"India has a huge market and need for energy, specifically LNG. Growing up in India I know we used to use LNG for cooking food," said Mr. Goel, referring to liquefied natural gas.
"If we see a change in the business environment in India, it will help B.C. [and] it will help the people who are here in the Indian community."

Full text:   Leona Hopman was walking her four dogs along a surging creek in the Okanagan on Saturday morning when she noticed a young horse in a torrent of water and immediately knew something was wrong.
It took more than an hour-and-a-half for a dozen firefighters and volunteers to pull the six-month-old wild filly - named River by one of the rescuers - from the frigid water. After struggling with the water and her rescuers, the feral horse was finally dragged from the creek exhausted and suffering from hypothermia.
Ms. Hopman, a local real estate agent, said she spotted the struggling animal on the far side of the creek at about 7:45 a.m. on Saturday.
"The horse was trying to get up the embankment. When I spotted her, she looked at me, then the current dragged her under the water, so I started to run."
She had no cellphone, so she raced to her car several kilometres away to get help.
The placid creek had started surging days earlier after substantial rains and warm weather in the valley. Large logs were rushing past the foal, putting it in danger of being injured. Ms. Hopman had seen a dead horse on the bank last year.
"I walk that creek every day. I guess it was River's lucky day that I was walking at that time and that I knew who to call to rescue her," she said.
Ms. Hopman drove to the home of a nearby horse advocate, Jennifer Ashton, who returned with her to try to help the horse. The two women tied a rope around its neck as they waited for firefighters.
Five members of the Summerland fire department got the call to respond at 8:18 a.m.
Rescuing a wild horse from rushing water is not a normal job for the composite department - a force of volunteers and professionals - but Fire Chief Glenn Noble was proud of the composure and effort he saw in a video of the rescue posted online.
"I don't know if we have any horse lovers, but the two guys who were in the water seemed to know what they were doing. It was a bit of a horse whisperer thing going on," he said.
The largely rural municipality of 12,000 in the southern Okanagan is dominated by vineyards and orchards. Herds of feral horses roam the area. Over the past five years, Theresa Nolet, operator of a local horse rescue, has helped save more than 30 of the animals.
Ms. Nolet assisted on Saturday, helping to dry and massage the horse. "One of the benefits of the fact that she was so hypothermic and exhausted was that she submitted to the handling. The weaker she got, the less fight she had in her," she said. "She's one lucky little filly."

Full text:   Caofeidian lies a three-hour drive east of Beijing, a Chinese industrial dream jutting into the sea. A decade ago, it was a pretty coast whose shallow waters were dotted with fishing vessels. Today, it's a manufacturer's paradise in the making, its eight-lane roads connecting sprawling factories to a vast port. Named after a former imperial concubine, it was a place of feverish fantasy, where borrowed money fuelled a vast reclamation effort to create 200 square kilometres of land and build something new.
When former Chinese president Hu Jintao came here in 2006, he called it a "treasure of a location" and likened it to "a piece of white paper, and the best and newest pictures ought to be drawn on it."
What he likely did not envision: a giant money pit, half of whose debt seems unlikely to be paid back.
Caofeidian was to be home to a million-person eco-city, a massive steel factory, a power plant, an oil refinery and a panoply of apartments, bus makers, warehouses, lumber plants, a Sino-Japanese business park, even an "exhibition centre of strategic new industries." A decade of spending poured $100-billion into the soil here, the equivalent of the annual budgets of British Columbia, Alberta, Manitoba and Saskatchewan combined.
But the loans that allowed all that spending have just 50 per cent odds of being paid back, says an independent research group that has spent years studying Caofeidian. The stakes are enormous. Caofeidian was a project of national importance for China, a "flagship," according to Jon Chan Kung, chief researcher at Anbound, a Beijing think tank.
"If this project fails, it proves that the major model driving China's development has also failed," he says.
Debt now stands to undo at least some of what China's spending has accomplished. Some of the country's major projects have done little more than strand vast amounts of invested capital. Debt is just one of the ticking time bombs in China today. China must also cope with the fallout from slowing spending in a place where social stability has been largely defined by one thing: the non-stop accumulation of wealth.
"There will be a financial crisis. And I feel that the financial crisis is in the near term," says Anne Stevenson Yang, co-founder of Beijing-based J Capital Research. "There will be a recession and then a long period of very, very slow growth. That's my definition of collapse. I'm not talking about people running through the streets with torches. That may or may not happen."
China has, for years now, become the engine of global growth. Its building sprees have kept afloat thousands of mines, its consumers have poured billions into the pockets of car manufacturers around the world, and its flush state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have become de facto bankers for energy, agricultural and other development in just about every country. China holds more U.S. Treasuries than any other nation outside the U.S. itself. It uses 46 per cent of the world's steel and 47 per cent of the world's copper. By 2010, its import- and export-oriented banks had surpassed the World Bank in lending to developed countries. In 2013, Chinese companies made $90-billion (U.S.) in non-financial overseas investments.
If China catches a cold, the rest of the world won't be sneezing - it will be headed for the emergency room.
And there is cause for worry. China has now become an "economy that is actually worth a lot less than they pretend it's worth," Ms. Stevenson Yang says.
By her estimate, 60 to 70 per cent of new lending is now going to service old debt. In 2006, $1.20 in new credit could stoke $1 in economic growth. Today, it takes over $3. At that rate, it takes a greater than 20-per-cent annual expansion in credit to sustain China's target 7.5-per-cent economic growth. "That just means that the problem itself is getting bigger," said Jonathan Cornish, managing director for Asian operations at Fitch Ratings.
China has spent the past three decades building wealth at a pace never before seen in human history. Now the world's second-largest economic power, it has pried hundreds of millions from abject poverty and built cities, factories and high-speed rail networks that are stunning in their modernity.
But the new face of China has come at an immense cost. Debt has exploded throughout the economy. According to Partners Capital, a private investment bank based in London, Boston and Hong Kong, the country's financial system has accumulated some $23.3-trillion in assets - loans made to companies and individuals - equivalent to about 260 per cent of gross domestic product. That's up by a whopping $15-trillion in only five years.
Interwoven networks of credit have developed with a byzantine level of complexity. They are underlain by a furiously competitive, and lightly regulated, shadow lending sector that has poured money into investments of vastly differing quality. Even the most cautious lenders in China, the state-owned banks that supported developments like Caofeidian, now find their portfolios strewn with rotten projects.
Much of the credit expansion is due to the explosion of shadow banking, which consists of trust companies, leasing companies, insurance firms and other types of non-bank financial institutions. Such shadow banks typically lend money to industry from capital raised from wealth management products sold via traditional banks to everyday individual investors who may not know exactly what they're buying into or understand the risks.
The shadow banks' growth spurt is the result of the 2008 global financial crisis, which rattled China. The country's growth rate tumbled from double-digits to just over 6 per cent. Hundreds of thousands of workers lost jobs. In response, Beijing unleashed a massive stimulus program. Credit demand exploded, to the point that credit has reached "bubble" status, according to some economists.
"What that stimulus program rested on was credit creation," said George Magnus, senior independent economic adviser to Swiss banking giant UBS. "There was some fiscal stimulus, but it was relatively minor. The lion's share of China's program was opening the sluice gates of lending. ... The legitimacy of the Communist Party in China was high economic growth."
The traditional banks, which are instruments of government policy, were essentially given carte blanche to support government investment programs, such as the construction of infrastructure. The shadow banks filled much of the fresh credit demand in the private economy. Their growth was assisted by the hefty rates they paid to investors over the regulated, and artificially low, rates paid by the banks. "Shadow banking is itself a reaction to the financial repression caused by regulated deposit and lending rates," HSBC Holdings chief executive officer Stuart Gulliver said in a March 27 speech in Hong Kong.
The growth of China's shadow banking system has been phenomenal. In 2000, about 80 per cent of all credit was supplied by the traditional banks, with shadow banks supplying the rest. By last year, the split between traditional banks and shadow banks was roughly 50/50. China's debt to GDP rose accordingly.
"The speed of accumulation of debt is what scares a lot of economists," Mr. Magnus said. "The credit creation in China has now become excessive. The new leadership of China knows this and the development model of China has to change or they could end up with a really nasty financial accident."
Since debt appears to be rising faster than nominal GDP, bad debts will inevitably rise among private companies, SOEs and local governments. The default rate, while still small over all, is rising. Bailouts are no longer automatic. "This is a good thing," Mr. Magnus says. "If you think your growth model has been overly reliant on credit, you have to allow this thing to take place."
Chief economist of Denmark's Saxo Bank, Steen Jakobsen, like Mr. Magnus, thinks that the Chinese government will deflate the credit bubble by allowing some defaults and bankruptcies - capital destruction, in other words - and attempting to reform SOEs and local governments. The process, of course, will remove some momentum from economic growth. The question is by how much.
Mr. Jakobsen predicts that "China, for a number of years, will have subpar growth to rebalance its economy. ... Over-investment will have to be replaced by under-investment to get back to the mean."
Alarm bells ringing
Signs of corporate pain are emerging. In the past month, Xuzhou Zhongsen Tonghao New Board Co. Ltd., a construction materials company, and Shanghai Chaori Solar Energy Science and Technology Co. Ltd., a solar panel manufacturer, both defaulted on bonds. Zhejiang Xingrun Real Estate Co., a real estate developer, also collapsed after failing to pay back $620-million in debt. A $495-million trust fund called Credit Equals Gold No. 1 narrowly averted default earlier this year when it was bailed out by an unknown group. And authorities had to resort to unusual means - including stacking bills high behind teller windows and keeping branches open 24 hours - to head off a recent run on Jiangsu Sheyang Rural Commercial Bank, a small bank in rural China.
On Monday, the China Iron and Steel Association said the first quarter brought $373-million (U.S.) in losses to the country's steel industry, with fully 45 per cent of firms posting red ink. All but one Chinese province missed growth targets in the first quarter, as China reported national growth at 7.4 per cent, below the 7.5-per-cent goal. In another troubling sign, China's Yurun Food Group reported declining Chinese food and beverage consumption, a startling reversal that prompted J Capital to say it marks "the end of an era in China."
"China is in alarming territory," said Victor Shih, a U.S. academic who was among the first to raise the alarm several years ago. "People in Beijing, including the highest leaders of China, may want to slow down this process of leveraging. But at this point, it's extremely difficult to do. The bubble is so big that when you try to deflate it, it may pop. The central government is walking a very tight line between wanting to delever a little bit while avoiding a financial crisis."
In the meantime, borrowed money is finding ever-more creative ways to flow through China, with a proliferation of schemes.
Under one increasingly popular financing structure, called trust beneficial rights or TBRs, banks buy only the cash flow of a particular asset. It's a complicated structure, with a simple, if worrisome, result: Using it, a bank can effectively lend to companies, but book the loan as an interbank asset - an investment - that allows it to assign a far lower risk weighting. That, in turn, allows the bank to apply a lower capital adequacy ratio rating, meaning it has less money on hand to backstop loans gone bad. It is a recipe for banking instability.
"It's totally sneaky. I hate it," says Jason Bedford, a Canadian who recently stepped down from nearly a decade with KPMG as an auditor and consultant in China. Among the problems the structure creates is "a perverse incentive to try to take a distressed loan and rebook it as a TBR. Why? Because you don't have to provision against investment losses."
"This is like the worst conspiracy theories that I've been hearing about for the last four years suddenly coming true. Banks really are hiding loans," he said.
Still, Mr. Bedford cautions against extrapolating one potentially bad apple to the whole tree. On the whole, he believes, the risks to the formal Chinese banking system have been overstated. He has spent years auditing banks, speaking with branch manager after branch manager who boasted not about interest margins or profitability - but about the solid performance of their lending portfolio.
The happiest are those who are "beaming and bragging about how they've never had a non-performing loan," he says. In China, "banks are in the business of avoiding risk, as opposed to managing risk," he says. That creates its own set of problems, but it does reduce the risk of bad debt.
Then there is the matter of the vested interests of the Chinese state. Financial stability and social stability are tightly linked, a relationship no one at the top levels of Chinese leadership is blind to. That offers a powerful argument against the likelihood of a dramatic crisis, something Beijing would like to avoid at all costs.
A landscape of busted dreams
History offers more reason to distrust the doomsayers. In the 1990s, amid another credit explosion, Chinese banks saw non-performing loans rise to at least 25 per cent of their portfolios - some believe the real number was as high as 40 per cent. In early 1999, Guangdong International Trust & Investment Corp., or GITIC, went bankrupt, leaving investors with $4.4-billion in unpaid loans. Worried observers called China's financial system among the worst on earth and predicted economic collapse.
It didn't happen. Banks were recapitalized with $32.5-billion in bond sales, and some of the bad debts were tossed into a series of state-owned asset management companies. Growth slowed - from 13.1 per cent in 1994 to 7.6 per cent in 1999 - but by 2003, the economy was roaring on again at 10 per cent.
The current situation nonetheless offers real reason for concern. In the 1990s, China's debt-to-GDP ratio, at 25 per cent, was far lower than most developed countries. Today, it's far higher. By how much is unclear, given the lack of solid official numbers and a vast disparity in external estimates. But it's evident that China has less room to manoeuvre now than it did 20 years ago.
And as Caofeidian makes clear, the problem today is on a scale far bigger than before. The steel industry was meant to be Caofeidian's champion, with Capital Steel, the Chinese corporate giant, its anchor tenant. But that industry is not doing well. Local reports suggest Chinese steel makers are sitting on $266-billion (Canadian) in debt they're unlikely to pay back - a bit more than Canada's annual federal budget - and Capital Steel, in particular, has fallen on hard times. In Caofeidian, only two of its eight stacks showed any signs of life on a recent visit. An official at a nearby port office said it was operating at 25 per cent capacity.
The company's Caofeidian steelworks lie on a landscape of busted dreams. The refinery hasn't been built to its expected size, given it was predicated on an oil field that turned out to have less than a quarter of the oil once thought. The Sino-Japanese park is a yawning dirt field, where nothing has been built.
The strategic industries exhibition centre has shiny, but empty, office buildings next to at least a dozen concrete skeletons of apartment buildings, all abandoned unfinished. There are no workers, and an access road has been drizzled with broken bottles to keep out cars. "There's no money," a local caretaker says, by way of explanation.
Not far away, down a six-lane road empty of traffic, lies another concrete shell, this one for a factory to build batteries for a next-door bus plant. Construction started in 2009, but it's nowhere near finished. "The boss has overdeveloped in this area," the project's caretaker says. "He has too many projects, and he's too short of capital."
Chen Baocun, who helped sell some of the area's first real estate developments, says early investments in Caofeidian "have been buried" in its reclaimed land. "And the infrastructure is far from complete." Parts of Caofeidian aren't even dry earth, with just under half of the expected land reclamation not accomplished.
Farther away, the road passes over two metal bridges that counsel against vehicle traffic, warning: "This bridge is dangerous." This is one of the ways to the eco-city, which is today three small clusters of buildings, two of them unoccupied. A visit to the eco-city's grocery store finds no customers, a wall split by a giant crack, and the lights kept off.
The eco-city's head planner, a man who co-ordinated 10 design firms to lay out a city for a million people, hasn't heard anything about the project in three years. After speaking with a reporter, Neville Mars, a Dutch architect based out of Shanghai, attempts to find out what happened, only to discover that those he used to work with at the project are no longer there. "That's not a good sign," he says. "It's clear that if the industrial projects are stalling, there is simply no impetus for the eco-city to be built."
And in many ways, as Caofeidian goes, so goes the rest of China - and, perhaps other parts of the world, too. "The Chinese government did not do well in controlling the speed of development, and it turned irrational," said Mr. Kung of Beijing's Anbound think tank.
"High-speed economic growth created the Chinese miracle, and created the four golden BRICs. But I feel it will destroy the miracle, and destroy the four countries, as well."

Lindvest has rolled out the first phase of a new infill project, four three-storey buildings of stacked townhouses, a housing type it says combines the size of a typical single-family house with the convenience and cost of a high-rise suite.
"Not everybody wants to ride an elevator or share common spaces, like hallways and lobbies," says Joseph Alberga, director of sales and marketing.
"In these homes, the neatest thing about them is you have your own front door - and by that I mean you come up to your door, put your key in the lock and as soon as you walk in, you are in your space."
The Brownstones of Westown are also situated in an established neighbourhood just off Sheppard Avenue, near Weston Road in Etobicoke.
Over the past several years, more than 400 singles, semis and townhouses have been constructed in the master planned community, so residents within this project will have full use of local attractions once occupancy begins next fall.
"A lot of people are weary of seeing an empty field or piece of land and being told this is where we're going to create a community. So the advantage here is that for the most part the construction - other than the construction of these units - is done," says Mr. Alberga.
"So you're moving into an area where sidewalks, roads and parks - including a beautiful park right in the middle of the neighbourhood with its own little splash pad and skating rink in the winter time - are already built amenity spaces and conveniences. You're not waiting for supermarkets, transit and shopping, it's all there."
Priced from $329,900, the brick and stone units will have one- or two-level plans with two bedrooms, balconies or patios, as well as underground parking.
"Within the city or anywhere in the GTA, the average price of a home - even freehold townhomes are edging into the high $500,000s and the reality is on the affordability scale, that's difficult for a single person or young couple who don't have equity buildup," Mr. Alberga notes.
"We had a few things going our way to maximize the suite spaces and also take advantage of adding the parking."
Schools, shops and golf courses, such as Oakdale and Humber Valley, are easily accessible, in addition to highways 401 and 400, TTC bus routes and Weston GO Train station.
"One of the things we're most excited about is the announcement that the Union Pearson Express - that goes from Union Station to the airport - will only have two stops and one of them is at the Weston GO station," says Mr. Alberga.
"Metrolinx's outlook for completion is also at the end of 2015, so if the stars align everything should come together at the same time."
In the meantime, on site, buyers can tour a single-storey, 942-square-foot model suite. "Knowing that people might be comparing us to traditional condo living, we built a full-sized model suite of our Astoria unit," says Mr. Alberga.
"Prospective purchasers coming from a high-rise mentality are getting the sense that for in and around the same pricing, you essentially get twice as much space because condo units downtown tend to be on the small side."
LUX Design will oversee the contemporary interiors with laminate and ceramic tile floors, upgraded kitchen cabinetry and oak staircases with upgraded iron spindles. Monthly fees will be 19 cents a square foot.

Full text:   A building style generally perceived as cold still has its fans and the financial hub of southwestern Ontario has many examples
daveleblanc@globeandmail.com
'This is the building that started it for me," says librarian and architecture enthusiast Sandra Miller. "When I first moved to London I thought, 'This is an interesting building, what's the story?'"
London City Hall is indeed interesting; it's another example of the importance given to Canadian civic buildings in the Modernist period. Designed by award-winning, local architect Philip Carter Johnson (1913-1976), the soaring 12-storey, white-marble building with a distinctive, 'floating' black-granite pod and splashes of colour via glazed brick at the base projects cool confidence and a forward-looking attitude.
Yet, "people hate it; I don't know why," she continues. "One of the councillors called it a 'sow's ear,'" she laughs.
Likely it's the general hate-on for the Modernist period (roughly 1945-1975), which many perceive as cold or uninteresting. Or, perhaps, it might be more specific: despite Mr. Johnson's love of Italian piazzas, the one he created here "never took off, it's always been this wind-blown, empty mess."
Certainly it's not because the building may have contributed to the architect's early demise, since that's an anecdotal tidbit with which most Forest City folk are completely unaware.
Similar to the sad story of how delays, debates and cost overruns caused Toronto city hall architect Viljo Revell to suffer a fatal heart attack before his masterpiece opened, Regina-born Mr. Johnson, says Ms. Miller, also experienced heart trouble while London's was in its final days of construction.
"He was sent home in an ambulance [but] he insisted that it stop at City Hall, and they wheeled him out of the back so that he could look at the building and make sure work was continuing to his standards." Ms. Miller, it should be noted, heard that story directly from Mr. Johnson's widow, who celebrates her 100th birthday this year.
It's stories like these that make Jane's Walks so very special. And on Sunday, May 4, at 1 p.m., Ms. Miller will share many more when she leads "Forest City Modern" for Museum London (see janeswalk.org for more details).
With a librarian's eye for detail, archivist's mind, activist's spirit and wacky sense of humour - all topped by a pile of red curls - Ms. Miller pulls no punches when it comes to her love of this period. It's a love that started approximately 15 years ago and has since motivated the 50-year-old to host "MidMod" architecture movie nights at the London library, join Docomomo Ontario (DOcumentation and COnservation of the MOdern MOvement) and speak out when buildings are threatened (she recently wrote to the London Free Press about proposed changes to the mostly original ground floor of London City Hall).
During the 11/2-hour walk, Jane's Walkers will learn of London's only confirmed Uno Prii-designed building, a hotel/apartment complex with a "colourful history" known as the Jack Tar Building at 186 King St.
"Right from the outset [it was] plagued - cursed if you will - with bankruptcy, fraud charges, construction liens, suspected arson, and there's been a revolving door of ownership, literally, from day one," she says
Originally planned as a Sheraton hotel for 1961, the building finally opened as an office building with apartment units in 1964, and then went through various incarnations - the Park Lane Motel, a Ramada Inn and a student residence -to become the "funny kind of mix of things" it is today.
To compare the way the shabby building looks now to the archival photo in Ms. Miller's hand is, of course, tragic. What isn't tragic in this, the financial hub of Southwestern Ontario, are the many banks that still proudly wear their Modernist clothes: walkers will stop at the corner of Richmond and King streets to admire the grid-like, precast concrete suit that adorns the handsome 1963 Toronto Dominion Bank by Toronto's Bruce Etherington, who moved to Hawaii at the height of his career (Mr.
Etherington's firm designed approximately 900 banks for TD). A peek inside reveals the 86-foot mural by Toronto-area artist/sculptor Count Alexander von Svoboda, who has lived a life richer than fiction (which Ms. Miller will tell walkers about).
"I love it," says Ms. Miller about the broad-shouldered, 1958 Bank of Montreal at the corner of Dundas and Wellington streets by local firm O.
Roy Moore; here, the mysteries of stone cladding known as "Bankite" will be revealed. Ms. Miller will also tell the tale of the largest windows created and installed in Canada (in 1960) at architect Peter Tillmann's Bank of Nova Scotia at 420 Richmond St.
Being an insurance town, the Jane's Walk also features stops at the 1927 Beaux-Arts London Life Insurance building to view the highly compatible 1964 addition by Toronto's Marani, Morris & Allan, and the striking turquoise spandrels panels on London's first curtain wall at the 1957 Crown Trust building at 200 Queens Ave. "This is our Modernist jewel," finishes Ms. Miller, adding that Tom Tillmann, son of the original architect, Peter Tillmann, moved his firm into the seventh floor a few years ago.
Luckily this building, as well as every other on the tour, now have some protection as part of London's new downtown Heritage Conservation District; Ms. Miller's partner, Michael Baker, worked as a consultant with the city to ensure this, as he "has a real weakness for Modernism."
Hopefully, after this Jane's Walk, Forest City natives will feel weak in the knees, too.

A new take on preserving the old

Abstract: The office's response is a tiny masterpiece, a house (as Ms. [Bollack] points out) that a child might draw, a diagram of houseness. The addition's form is a radically simplified riff off the older dwelling, but is distinguished from it by the cladding of walls and pitched roof with zinc sheets.

Full text:   In trying to save our heritage buildings while giving them new life, we too often create architectural zombies. There's a better way
jmays@globeandmail.com
To some degree or another, every right-thinking Torontonian is an architectural preservationist nowadays.
We revere our city's Victorian and Edwardian fabric, and we circulate petitions when a splinter or brick of it is endangered. Public resistance routinely breaks out when a developer proposes the demolition of something city hall has dubbed a "heritage property." Rather than replace a house or commercial building that's outlived its usefulness, we tend to gut, remodel, re-purpose, and modernize its interior, shore up its antique exterior, then congratulate ourselves on having done our bit to save Toronto's historic "character."
We should be glad that developers have spared many sturdy buildings put up in the age of steam and gaslights, and found new careers for them as condominium stacks, office blocks and such. Old houses, and the streetscapes they generate, have also been beneficiaries of the benevolent attitudes toward the past that have taken root in Toronto during the past 50 years.
But few of these acts of conservation have demanded much more from local architects than a certain knack for taxidermy. Taxidermy, of course, is not the worst thing that can happen to an elderly building people want to rescue. Becoming a zombie is. At its least interesting, preservationism promotes the presence of the living dead among us - facades wrapped around completely disjunct interiors, or surviving only as random fragments or souvenirs recycled into contemporary structures, perfunctory nods to "history," without weight or life.
When it comes to saving and renewing our architectural inheritance, Toronto can do better than this. How much better we can do is one thing I learned from the entertaining and engaging new book from Monacelli Press called Old Buildings, New Forms: New Directions in Architectural Transformations .
The creation of Françoise Astorg Bollack, a preservation architect and educator based in New York City, this portfolio features 28 projects illustrating things that have happened when contemporary design imagination encountered and transfigured old buildings in (mostly) the United States and Europe. (There is one Canadian example here, British architect Will Alsop's Sharp Centre for Design, in Toronto.)
By Ms. Bollack's count, the architects who interest her have created five different kinds of new-old objects, each providing her with a chapter title and a framework for examples. They are: insertions, parasites (her word), wraps, juxtapositions and weavings. Each term is to be taken as a clear, literal description of a strategy developed to address a specific problem posed by an old building worth sparing.
Mr. Alsop's Sharp Centre, for example - a parasite - had to fly high in order to preserve the views of Grange Park from nearby apartment windows, but it also (like a proper parasite) had to interact with the aesthetically pedestrian headquarters (1956, 1962) of the Ontario College of Art and Design University, its host organism. Hoisted aloft on giant toothpicks, connected to the main building below by a bright red chute, the Sharp pavilion celebrates both the collision of the old and new, and their institutional symbiosis.
That said, I wonder if the Will Alsop building might have been more comfortably situated in Ms. Bollack's especially suggestive section devoted to juxtapositions. That's where she has put examples that emphasize stark differences between old and new. "The projects in this chapter," she explains, "relate to the original building they are expanding by standing aside [literally] and offering a contrast that enhances the older building." They encourage artistic boldness when making additions - a character trait too often lacking in house expansions in Toronto.
The construction of Empty Nest (2002), a residential ensemble presented in this chapter, started with a simple, symmetrical, pitched-roofed and otherwise traditional house in a Boston suburb. The owners asked the Brooklyn architectural firm of Della Valle + Bernheimer to fashion an extension.
The office's response is a tiny masterpiece, a house (as Ms. Bollack points out) that a child might draw, a diagram of houseness. The addition's form is a radically simplified riff off the older dwelling, but is distinguished from it by the cladding of walls and pitched roof with zinc sheets. Several homely grace-notes connect it to the old house it's attached to - the windows in the zinc walls are framed with warm wood, for example. "These small modifiers take the chill out of the diagram," Ms. Bollack writes, "and add subtle domestic touches that give the building a fascinating poetic complexity."
Unlike complex Empty Nest, the organization of this book is straightforward, plain. The text is uncomplicated - though reading the introduction will be eased by an acquaintance with modern and post-modern trends in the visual arts - and it is deeply felt. The author has a message about the architecture of new-meets-old that she passionately wants to share with us. It's a message we should attend to, if only to learn about the new, expanded meanings that talented architects are currently giving to the old idea of preservation.

Abstract: "That person could be quite content to work here for a few years and then go home. Historically the permanent immigration system has been remarkably slow with a wait time as high as four years," Mr. [Arthur Sweetman] said. "The temporary foreign worker approach is a much faster program. If you want to bring someone in today, that's the program. There are really only two choices, temporary and permanent, there is nothing else."

Full text:   Local governments, health services and school boards across Canada are among the employers across all sectors that have applied to hire temporary foreign workers.
In the shadow of last week's decision by federal Employment Minister Jason Kenney to suspend the use of the program in the food-services sector amid reports of abuses by fast-food restaurants, public-sector employers continue to quietly employ thousands of foreign workers for specialized jobs.
In Surrey, B.C., a municipal transportation planner is a temporary foreign worker, as is a diagnostic medical stenographer - someone who reads medical scans - employed by the health authority in neighbouring Vancouver.
In the Alberta plains an hour south of Edmonton, the Miyo Wahkohtowin First Nations school board employs a sign language interpreter for a local deaf student. The school board serves a number of Cree reserves around the hamlet of Maskwacis. The interpreter is an American, employed under the temporary foreign worker program.
"We're on a reserve so it's hard to find a person who is willing to work here. The government was very rigorous and there was a lot of paperwork, but it relented in the end and let us hire them. It worked out well," said a school board official who isn't authorized to speak with the media.
According to federal documents, more than 33,000 labour market opinions - the first step for employers looking to hire foreign workers - were approved between 2010 and 2012. The documents show that about half the approved opinions resulted in work permits.
Among the businesses and organizations applying for those opinions are more than a dozen cities. Hundreds of foreign workers have been hired in large cities and small towns. Most were hired for positions requiring highly specialized skills after no qualified Canadians could be found.
When the City of Campbell River on the east coast of Vancouver Island needed a planning technician to fill a maternity position, no local applicants were found after the job was posted twice.
Then an applicant contacted Colleen Tillapaugh, the city's human resources manager. She was qualified for the job, but her visa would run out before the end of the position.
Ms. Tillapaugh applied to hire the planner as a temporary foreign worker. "It wasn't too difficult. It was a five-page application and we had to prove that we had advertised locally," she said. The woman worked in the community and left when the contract expired in August, 2012.
The Campbell River case reveals how the temporary foreign worker program was originally designed to work, according to Arthur Sweetman, an economist at McMaster University.
"That person could be quite content to work here for a few years and then go home. Historically the permanent immigration system has been remarkably slow with a wait time as high as four years," Mr. Sweetman said. "The temporary foreign worker approach is a much faster program. If you want to bring someone in today, that's the program. There are really only two choices, temporary and permanent, there is nothing else."
Unlike a food-services sector which has attracted migrants from disadvantage countries, often with the promise of eventual help to attain permanent status in Canada, many of the specialized workers hired by municipalities harbour no long-term dreams of life in Canada. They are hired for two years, gain experience and then most return home.
The City of Vancouver has hired three people under the program. Citing privacy concerns, officials couldn't comment on what the jobs are, but they are described as senior positions that required national searches which yielded no candidates.
The City of Edmonton was approved to hire temporary foreign workers, but eventually declined to do so. "We looked into it at one point and kept our name in the running, but we didn't ever go through with it," said city spokeswoman Lori Yanish.
Montreal's departments of parks and recreation, urban planning and the city's real estate arm also applied and were approved for access to the program. None has yet to make a hire. The same is true in Ottawa.

Full text:   Spring is crucial to the real estate business because it's the time of year when a disproportionately large number of homes change hands.
So far, this one has been tepid at best. The number of existing homes that sold in Canada in March was more than 8 per cent below the average of the past 10 years, and 30 per cent below the peak sales level that was reached in May, 2012.
But David Stafford, managing director of real-estate secured lending at the Bank of Nova Scotia, suggests that when it comes to real estate, spring is finally on the way.
"We're seeing now what we saw last year in March," he said. "I'm a believer that weather has a lot to do with this business. I was caught in a blizzard April 1 in Newfoundland. Nobody's buying houses in a foot of snow. There's flooding in various places across the country as the melt starts. But Vancouver came to life first in terms of the resale business in February. Calgary's now hopping. Ontario's starting. We've seen the volumes start to climb, but we're probably a month behind last year in terms of timing."
Some economists similarly suspect that unusually cold weather was responsible for sluggish winter sales, and that there will be a burst of life in the housing market as temperatures heat up.
Local real estate boards will start releasing some April sales data in the next week. But this year, we might have to wait until the May numbers are available to really determine how the all-important spring selling season is shaping up.

Full text:   U.S. buyout giant sees fertile ground for transactions, hires Onex deal maker as executive adviser
Buyout giant Blackstone Group is coming to Canada, hiring a local private equity specialist to look for transactions north of the border.
New York-based Blackstone is bringing on Andrew Lapham, a former deal maker at Onex Corp., as an executive adviser. He will be based in Toronto.
Blackstone is the world's largest manager of so-called alternative investments, which include real estate and private equity. In total, it manages $272-billion (U.S.) of assets. Globally, it is behind some of the largest mega-buyouts in history, such as the $39-billion (U.S.) purchase in 2007 of Equity Office Properties. However, it has not had a big presence in Canada.
The firm's belief now is Canada represents fertile ground for transactions because the private equity business is not as big in this country as in the U.S. With the exception of Onex, many of the private equity firms in Canada do mid-sized deals. Blackstone, by contrast, would start with deals in the $300-millon range and could go much higher. Its recent buyout funds are many times the size of even Onex's.
"Canada is a very attractive market," said Mr. Lapham. "It is sizable. Blackstone's idea, and mine, is that having a local presence gives you that much more of an opportunity to find great deals and identify great potential management teams and partners."
There are other U.S. private equity fund managers active in Canada. KKR & Co. plans a Calgary office to look for transactions related to energy. Bain Capital has also been busy in Canada, investing in companies ranging from Dollarama Inc. to Bombardier Recreational Products to parka maker Canada Goose.
While Blackstone has not historically done many deals in Canada, it does have investors here. For example, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board has committed $1.1-billion to Blackstone buyout funds, according to CPPIB's own disclosure.
"Canada is both a strategic market for Blackstone and home to many of our most important limited partner relationships," Joseph Baratta, Blackstone's global head of private equity, said in announcing Mr. Lapham's appointment. "It is critical to our firm to have a local presence in Canada."
Blackstone does not focus on any particular sector but looks for opportunities wherever it finds them. In addition to Equity Office, ranked the third-largest leveraged buyout in history, Blackstone's real estate arm was behind the $27.7-billion purchase of Hilton Hotels in 2007. Blackstone's private equity group has also invested in auto-parts makers, media outlets such as The Weather Channel and amusement parks, including Sea World, Legoland and Universal Studios.
Earlier this month, Blackstone agreed to pay $5.4-billion to buy Gates Global, a maker of a wide range of industrial products, from CPPIB and Onex.
The firm expects to have the same wide-ranging approach in Canada. However, given that Canada's economy has a huge energy component, and Blackstone has a fund that is specifically oriented to energy, the oil patch will certainly garner some of the firm's attention.
"It will be a diversified approach," said Mr. Lapham. "I would expect to see energy as a part of that."
Mr. Lapham departed from Onex about a year ago, and has since had his own firm, Northern Private Capital, where he had been looking for private equity transactions.

Is the Conservative government in Ottawa out to destroy Downsview Park? That is what local City Councillor Maria Augimeri is claiming.
At a public meeting on Wednesday, she took aim at Canada Lands, the federal agency in charge of Downsview. "You are selling our parkland," she thundered. "You are selling the heritage for our children and our children's children."
Away from podium, she told me: "These people would sell their grandmother if they could. These people are dollar hungry. That's all they see out of their eyes: dollar signs."
What could possibly justify such language? Ms. Augimeri might be forgiven if the threat she is warning about were real. It isn't. Canada Lands executive Robert Howald assured the meeting that it has no intention of selling parkland or even of increasing densities in the parts of the sprawling Downsview lands that are designated for residential development.
Ms. Augimeri calls those assurances "lies." Her supporters yelled "B.S." and chanted "park, park, park." Even Olivia Chow, attending as a candidate for mayor, told the crowd she is skeptical about the city-approved "secondary plan" for the lands. "My worry is that this secondary plan does not work," she said. "It is now a housing development rather than a park."
In fact, Downsview is meant to be much more than a simple tract of grass and park benches. In 1994, the government of Liberal prime minister Jean Chretien announced a plan to create a national urban park at Downsview, long home to a military base and aircraft factories. The park was to be self-financing. In practice, that meant leasing or selling some of the land for development, with the remainder to remain public space. Blueprints envision a mix of public parkland, sports facilities, cultural uses, housing and commercial space. The secondary plan was approved by a vote of city council and upheld by the Ontario Municipal Board.
After a slow start, the plan has begun to take shape. Downsview has become a sports hub, hosting modern facilities for squash, soccer and other pursuits. It includes film studios and outdoor-concert grounds. The park opened in 2012 and boasts 70,000 new trees.
In the coming years, five new neighbourhoods are to rise on adjoining Downsview lands, each with extensive parklands of their own. Plans also call for a "cultural commons" with a public square and indoor community space. The planners take their inspiration from the Wychwood Barns, old streetcar sheds repurposed for community space, and the Evergreen Brick Works, an environmental centre in the Don Valley.
None of this impresses Ms. Augimeri. She suspects that the park "will be whittled away to nothingness. There will be very little useable park space."
Her fears rest on the fact that Ottawa put Canada Lands in charge of the 232-hectare site. The fears gained fuel when the Toronto Star obtained a 2012 memo from a senior federal official saying that, as a real-estate company, Canada Lands "may be inclined" to dispose of some of the land. Both the government and Canada Lands insist they won't do anything of the sort, and they would face an almighty storm if they did.
If, on the other hand, Canada Lands simply proceeds with the creative plan for the site, the city can only benefit. With a new subway stop going in and nearby highway access, Downsview is an ideal place to build a truly urban space, mixing traditional parkland - lawns, woods, bike paths, walking trails, sports fields - with athletic facilities and community spaces that attract people year-round. Adding attractive new neighbourhoods and new roads to link them will only bring more life to what might otherwise have become a vast, blank and underused space.
"We live in the biggest city in the country," says Anthony Fernando, who is running against Ms. Augimeri in the October election in her district, Ward 9. "An 'urban park' is going to be ... urban. The pluses far outweigh the minuses here."
That is a far more sensible take on Downsview than Ms. Augimeri's conspiracy theory.

Abstract: Airbnb has turned the quaint business of bed and breakfast - renting a spare bedroom to a tourist or low-budget commercial traveller - into a multinational corporation. After the firm's latest financing, it's worth some $10-billion (U.S.), and it operates in 35,000 cities, offering a bed for the night in lodgings that range from four-poster beds in palatial castles to sofas in dingy flats.

Full text:   It's the thin red line that protects a free people from state tyranny, thinks Airbnb Inc. The rest of us might think it was just a quick way to make a few hundred bucks. Indeed, that is probably how Eric Schneiderman, New York's Attorney-General, sees it, and that's why he wants to know who is hiding under the beds and in the closets, collecting the rents. In the outraged language of Airbnb's blog: "If you're one of the thousands of New Yorkers who has ever rented out your place while you were away for a weekend, the Attorney-General still wants to know who you are and where you live."
Airbnb has turned the quaint business of bed and breakfast - renting a spare bedroom to a tourist or low-budget commercial traveller - into a multinational corporation. After the firm's latest financing, it's worth some $10-billion (U.S.), and it operates in 35,000 cities, offering a bed for the night in lodgings that range from four-poster beds in palatial castles to sofas in dingy flats. We have become used to the idea of hotel companies that don't own real estate, but Airbnb doesn't know or even care when the sheets were last changed on the bed. It is a business model that is as far removed from the underlying activity as eBay Inc. is from its millions of vendors. And that is what irks the New York Attorney-General and the community of New York hoteliers. Airbnb's providers are not regulated - and probably are not paying all the taxes due.
In an effort to jam the wheels of Airbnb's juggernaut, Mr. Schneiderman subpoenaed the company in October to hand over data concerning some 15,000 New Yorkers who have advertised rooms on the website's booking service. The Attorney-General isn't, apparently, chasing legitimate householders offering up a spare room, but those who are violating state laws by renting out multiple rooms in the manner of a hotel or even a brothel. In an effort to head off the offensive, Airbnb quickly removed some 2,000 "bad apples" from its listing. It even offered to set up a system to collect New York's hotel tax on behalf of the authorities, but to no avail. The company is locking horns with the Attorney-General in a New York state courtroom this week over the data demand.
Frequent visitors to the city might think the local authorities ought to be pleased that entrepreneurs are finally putting up real competition to the overpriced and often lousy service offered by New York hoteliers. Visitors to Paris would take the same view of Uber BV, the mobile-app taxi service whose introduction almost shut down Paris when the union representing the city's official licensed taxis launched an ill-tempered strike blocking access to airports and highways.
If the row was just about the collision of vested interests opposed to the arrival of a disruptive technology which creates unwanted competition, the answer would be simple: Ignore the protesters. New York's complex hotel regulation is archaic and needs to be reformed; Paris needs more taxis and every big city needs better, cheaper accommodation. What worries the government is the way in which businesses such as Airbnb and Uber can create vast and profitable business networks which operate out of sight and tax-free.
A couple of years ago, it was assumed that businesses like Airbnb were creatures of recession, feeding off the crisis by offering middle-class householders a means of paying the mortgage in hard times. So far, recovery does not seem to have dented the enthusiasm of the renters. The underlying story may be that, far from being the byproducts of a downturn, small-scale entrepreneurs are leading the economic recovery, using digital intermediaries to sell their services at low cost and under the radar - taxi drivers, landlords and dealers in all sorts of goods.
It is a huge challenge to governments - clamp down on the unregulated, untaxed digital businesses and you kill off the recovery. Ignore them and you give tacit approval to a burgeoning underground economy that digs a large hole in the state's tax base. This may be the birth of a political conflict of global dimension, and New York's attack on part-time hoteliers is just the first shot over the bows.

Full text:   Calculations about crowding are at the top of a lot of local minds lately as Vancouver embraces a love affair with mass ridership
Get a roll of tape and use it to outline a square one metre by one metre on the floor. Find three friends. Stand inside that box with them. For 20 minutes. Perhaps 30.
Does that feel comfortable? We hope so. Because that is the golden standard that transit planners in North America use to decide whether a bus or a subway car is too crowded - or underused. Four is just right. More than that is not. But we hope you're okay with two more friends inside that box with you occasionally.
You'd better be, since that's what it gets like for a couple of hours a day at peak rush hour in the growing metropolis of Vancouver, especially on the region's ever-more-popular rapid-transit lines.
And, according to the authorities at this city's regional transit authority, no one is going to order a few million dollars worth of new subway cars just to alleviate that. Not until the system is heading for five and six people in that box for more than just rush hour.
"There is a comfortable ride most of the day. If the fleet is only going to be busiest for that 15 minutes of the day, it doesn't make sense to deploy resources only used for that 15 minutes," said Jeff Busby, the director of infrastructure planning at TransLink.
But that four-person-per-square-metre formula, along with other mathematical calculations about the maximum crowding permissible on platforms, elevators and bus stops, is at the top of a lot of local minds lately as Vancouver embraces a continent-wide love affair with transit.
Cities are racing to put in more light-rail, rapid-bus and train lines. Commuters, pushed by high gas prices and pulled by the attractive new lines, are flocking to use them. Transit ridership is at its highest point since the 1950s. And office and home builders are talking about nothing but transit-oriented development these days.
That's producing jammed lines, still more condos and offices being planned along them, and a scramble to figure out how to accommodate that explosive growth.
That's nowhere more evident than around this region's Richmond-Vancouver Canada Line, which has exceeded all projections for ridership.
Many Vancouver residents who came out to a recent public hearing to express their opinions about a 2,900-unit megadevelopment at the Oakridge Centre mall - which sits on top of the 41st Avenue station of the Canada Line - said the line is already at capacity. So how, they wanted to know, will there be any room for the 50,000 or so new residents about to arrive all the way along the line, from Richmond Centre to downtown?
"TransLink can't meet the current demand," said Sophie Petric, a former nurse who lives a few blocks from Oakridge. "Even in off-peak hours, I've been on when it's already pretty full. I don't have any confidence anyone is looking at the whole thing."
Vancouver is one of a very small group of cities at the forefront of that kind of demand.
"I think this is going to start happening in all the cities that are planning transit successfully," said John Renne, a U.S. expert in transit-oriented development based at the University of New Orleans and the managing director of a real-estate development company, the TOD Group. "It's a growing pain."
At a January meeting at the U.S. Transportation Research Board, Mr. Renne said he and other participants heard for the first time about a new urban problem - too many people on transit.
Washington is going through something similar to Vancouver. It has so many developments planned along the local lines that the director for Metro, the transit agency, told the Washington Post last fall that "the system is kind of busting at the seams."
Mr. Renne said such transit jams have people talking about new kinds of planning, to try to even out the demand so people are travelling both ways on the system to homes and jobs. In the meantime, everyone locally is trying to figure out how to plan - or pay for - increased service along the lines as density coagulates along those municipal arteries.
It's the job of Mr. Busby's department at TransLink to figure out where all the people and jobs are going to be 10, 20 and 30 years from now - and when to trigger a higher level of service or expansion.
The current work being done to stations all along the Expo line are the result of that kind of planning. When the line opened in 1986, it had a capacity of about 12,000 people per hour per direction (pphpd, in transit-planner speak). Just before the Olympic Games opened in 2010, the agency got 48 new cars, which boosted the capacity to 16,000.
The Expo line had started to exceed the four-person-in-the-box standard in 2007. Now TransLink is in the slow process of spending $1-billion to create larger platforms and more escalators, and add more cars to boost the capacity to 25,700 by 2031.
There's a similar plan in place for the Canada Line - some day. Contrary to what a lot of people think, the Canada Line - which looks dinky compared to the honking trains that run in large metro systems like London, Toronto or Paris - has a lot of capacity. Even though the line only has two-car trains, the Canada Line's driverless, automated system allows TransLink, if it has enough cars, to run trains much closer together than a Toronto-type operation.
Mr. Busby says TransLink could increase the capacity of the current system just by running trains every two minutes, instead of the three minutes and 20 seconds that its private partner is currently required to provide. The two-minute intervals would increase the capacity from 6,100 pphpd to 10,000 pphpd. (And currently, he points out, the system is running at only 5,500 pphpd.)
"We have included all the estimates for regional growth, development along Cambie and in Richmond and, even by 2045, we can suffice with these two-car trains."
More growth after that? The agency could extend the platforms (which were deliberately designed for that eventuality) and add one car to each train.
Of course, the problem with all of this is money. TransLink has been stuck in limbo for four years, trying to get the province to agree to new sources of money for additional service and expansions to the network. In the meantime, it's struggled just to keep up with growing population.
The province has insisted there be a regional referendum to get the public's say on new money. That has created massive public uncertainty.
"Citizens ... know a million people are coming. They know that [adding density] is the right thing from a textbook perspective," said Richard Walton, the chair of the TransLink mayors' council and the mayor of the District of North Vancouver, which is going through some painful public hearings at the moment about its official community plan. "But they say, 'We're not prepared to put our faith in the three levels of government to come up with the funding for the services. We hear your ideology but we don't believe you can get there.'"

Full text:   RETAILING REPORTER
Another fast-growing U.S. retailer is setting the stage to launch in Canada.
DSW Inc. , a leading shoe chain known for selling high-profile brands from Nike to Nine West at discount prices, is buying a 44-per-cent stake in Canadian rival Town Shoes for $62-million - with options to buy the rest after four years.
The deal gives DSW, which stands for Designer Shoe Warehouse, a way to enter the Canadian market, which has stumped some other U.S. chains. DSW has chosen to come here with a domestic partner - Town Shoes - allowing DSW to tap into its local savvy to help in setting up retail locations, logistics and other operations.
Town Shoes, with annual sales of $291-million last year, is this country's largest retailer of footwear and accessories, with 182 stores, including its namesake and The Shoe Company, its discount arm.
"We have looked at Canadian entry options for some time and decided to acquire an existing operation with a long track record of success and to use this operation as a base from which we can establish the DSW brand in Canada," said Mike MacDonald, president and chief executive officer of DSW of Columbus, Ohio.
Added Bruce Dinan, president and chief executive officer of Town Shoes: "Our combined retail banners provide different avenues for serving unique customer lifestyles in Canada, ranging from Town's full priced, specialty retail model to The Shoe Company's and Shoe Warehouse's off-price concepts."
In an e-mail, Christina Cheng, senior director of investor relations at DSW, said it has "not made specific plans for opening DSW stores in the near term" in Canada. She said the Canadian customer is different from the one south of the border and "Town Shoes knows the Canadian customer best." She said the Toronto-based retailer will continue to operate its store banners under current management.
DSW and Shoe Company are similar in concept, with warehouse-type, largely self-serve stores selling a wide range of styles and brands. Some have compared them to the Winners concept of discount retailing.
Last year, U.S. discounter Target Corp. struggled in its rollout in Canada after it acquired former Zellers leases for $1.8-billion and set up shop in many of those stores. But Target counted on its own internal top management from the U.S. to steer its Canadian course. Other foreign retailers have been challenged here in finding attractive real estate at reasonable rates amid a shortage of good locations.
DSW could keep running all its banners here, including launching DSW, industry observers said. It's a strategy that worked for Best Buy Co. when it came to Canada in 2001 by acquiring Future Shop but keeping that name. DSW could also convert some Shoe Company stores to DSW or build new DSW outlets, consultants said.
DSW is buying its initial 44-per-cent interest in Town Shoes from the Alberta Investment Management Corp. (AIMCo), the Toronto-based retailer's key owner. Callisto Capital, a Canadian private equity firm, owns the rest.
Lawrence Stevenson, chairman of Town Shoes and managing director of Callisto, said he is pleased to have DSW as a strategic partner.

Full text:   Stockholm's once-gritty 'knife district' has reinvented itself as a waterfront destination beloved for its vibrant dining scene, unique shops and down-to-earth vibe
Stockholm's once-gritty Sodermalm district - the setting for author Stieg Larsson's popular Millennium Trilogy - has turned into some of the hippest real estate in the Nordic world. The Hornstull neighbourhood, at its western edge, is the latest area to brush off a murky past and reinvent itself.
Once dubbed "knife-soder" because of its rough reputation, an influx of restaurants, cafes and bars to Hornstull has changed that to "knife-and-fork soder," and it's definitely worth a visit. Here, you'll get a different taste of Stockholm, because few of Hornstull's restaurants feature traditional Swedish fare. Instead, the focus is on international flavours.
Unlike the shops selling Viking helmets in Stockholm's old town, or the glitter of the ABBA museum, Hornstull is a vibrant, workaday neighbourhood that can easily be explored in a day. Despite the modernizing changes in the area, many of its historic aspects have been retained, as has the sense of community. Long-time residents still congregate outside to discuss the latest news and families push strollers along busy streets.
Hornstull is a major commuter hub from the southwestern suburbs into the city centre, and it's not surprising that some of the recent changes can be seen as soon as you leave the subway. You immediately walk into a small shopping mall and, just outside, see the new Hornhuset building, which opened last year. Each of its three storeys offers a different dining option focused primarily on Mediterranean fare.
The soccer-loving Enzo's Trattoria adds some Italian flavour with classic Neapolitan pizza on the top floor and excellent views from its terrace. At night, Enzo's becomes a lively bar. Nearby, you'll find a memorably named restaurant, Taylor & Jones with the Twist, where English-style sausages and sandwiches are paired with a selection of on-tap beers from Sweden and beyond.
Around the corner, a space known as Tjoget is home to a barbershop, a florist that sells only locally grown plants and flowers, and a restaurant. Hipsters can get their beards trimmed at Roy & Son, while Linje Tio restaurant offers New York-meets-Paris chic.
Its menu celebrates mostly southern European flavours, including Spanish chorizo, Italian salami fenocchio, French boeuf braisé and a few vegetarian dishes.
Hornstull boasts more than interesting new restaurants, bars and shops, of course. Artists enjoy places such as Parallel, a combined gallery, café and workspace, where you can buy work from local artists or create your own in a 3-D print shop.
The district is also home to one of Stockholm's best music venues, Debaser, which has two connected restaurants, Calexico's (Mexican) and Bar Brooklyn (its menu includes American-style sliders).
Despite the changing neighbourhood, older Hornstull shops continue to thrive, such as Mickes Serier CD & Vinyl. For 17 years, it has been selling music finds such as rare vinyl from the Beatles and early Joy Division singles.
The store recently opened a second shop, just across the street on Langholmsgatan, focusing on hip-hop and reggae. Owner Micke Englund has lived in Hornstull since 1999 and is happy with the area's new spirit - and the fact that it still attracts the creative types that keep it lively.
"I'm here seven days a week," he says with a smile.
A short walk away is the historic Liljeholmsbadet, a floating bathhouse dating to 1929. During its early years, people would come here to wash because showers and baths weren't common in apartments.
Now you can swim here in every season except summer, when most residents simply dive into the waters surrounding the city.
After their long winters, Swedes like to stay outside as much as possible in warmer months. One such destination for a summer night might be Lasse i Parken, a snug café in the middle of one Hornstull parks that offers outdoor seating, live music and Swedish fare - think fresh trout with dill, new potatoes and lingonberries.
One of Hornstull's greatest assets is its beautiful Liljeholmsviken waterfront, with its abundant green space. In the summer, it also hosts a Sunday market with everything from used CDs to vintage clothing.
The market is also becoming known for its varied food trucks, where you can sample international treats such as Vietnamese sandwiches and American-style barbecue. The colourful trucks are a fitting symbol of Hornstull's busy, melting-pot atmosphere.

Abstract: Even with high costs and low productivity, which could be damaging if global LNG prices drop in years ahead, Australian projects have a distinct advantage because of the head start. By 2015, many of these LNG projects will be operating with two "trains," or separate LNG cooling processes, but most LNG sites are approved for three or four production trains. Western Australia's $50-billion North West Shelf Venture (Woodside, BHP Billiton, BP PLC and others) already has five trains.

Full text:   HOW AUSTRALIA BUILT A BIG LEAD
On a warm evening in late February, on an island just off the coast of eastern Australia, workers started to pour the concrete roof of an enormous liquefied natural gas tank that stretches 90 metres in circumference and rises 10 storeys into the sky.
The workers toil away late at night to avoid the searing heat of Australia's late summer sun. They had recently built the roof for an identical adjacent container, both part of the $24.7-billion Australian ($25.5-billion Canadian) joint venture Australia Pacific LNG, owned by American oil and gas firm ConocoPhillips Co., Australian energy giant Origin and China's state-owned Sinopec.
The two enormous tanks will hold natural gas tapped from the deep coal beds further inland and piped hundreds of kilometres to the LNG export terminal on Queensland's Curtis Island. Facing the sheltered harbour of the industrial port city of Gladstone, the gas will be chilled until it condenses to one-six-hundredth of its original size - essentially from the size of a beach ball down to a table tennis ball - making it possible to load the liquid gas onto LNG carriers with enormous domed tanks and ship it off to the surging economies of Asia.
"I don't know how many cranes we have out there, but it's a bunch," says Kent Anderson, ConocoPhillips' project manager for Australia Pacific LNG. "It's a good clean fuel and it just seems the world can't get enough of it at the moment."
The world is undergoing an LNG boom, and Australia is at the epicentre. Right next door to Australia Pacific LNG's 3,600 workers on Curtis Island is a similar-sized, $20.4-billion (U.S.) LNG export terminal under construction for a project led by British-based BG Group. And next door to that is yet another project run by Australian energy firm Santos, worth about $18.5-billion. Remarkably, construction might begin on a fourth LNG project next to that one if Royal Dutch Shell PLC decides - amid global restructuring and approvals - to push ahead with it.
All of these huge Australian projects have long-term sales contracts with massive Asian firms such as Korea Gas Corp., Malaysia's Petronas, Japan's Kansai Electric and China National Offshore Oil Corp. (CNOOC).
Half a world away, meanwhile, there are bold plans to make Canada an LNG powerhouse, targeting many of the same Asian firms as customers. But Australia's huge head start, the massive scope of its LNG projects, and major cost overruns encountered along the way threaten Canada's success as it jumps into a global industry that promises to be intensely competitive.
Canada, or more specifically British Columbia, will be lucky to have three LNG export terminals by the end of the decade. Australia, on the other hand, has three LNG export terminals nearing completion in the small port city of Gladstone alone - and this is just one small corner of a surging Australian gas export sector that will likely help the country overtake Qatar as the world's leading LNG exporter.
There is a lot of promise in British Columbia but relatively little happening on the ground. There are at least 14 B.C. LNG projects planned, but industry experts caution that launching just one project will be a major challenge. With B.C.'s delayed tax regime, environmental assessments, a lack of local infrastructure and complicated negotiations with First Nations, it remains unclear how many companies will stick it out. No final investment decisions have been made yet to build LNG projects on Canada's Asia-facing West Coast.
LNG projects require massive levels of investment and each delay increases the likelihood of being squeezed out due to a looming gush of global gas supplies scheduled for 2018 and 2019. Companies will be facing pressure this year to make final investment decisions or miss the chance to export B.C. LNG.
Nevertheless, B.C. Premier Christy Clark and her provincial Liberal government hope LNG projects could pump $1-trillion (Canadian) into the economy over three decades, helping generate 39,000 construction jobs, as well as tens of thousands of other LNG-related positions.
Of the planned projects, Pacific NorthWest LNG project, headed by Malaysia's state-owned Petronas, is the most likely to proceed to construction on Lelu Island near Prince Rupert. Another promising project is Kitimat LNG, owned by the Canadian units of Chevron Corp. and Apache Corp.
B.C. Natural Gas Development Minister Rich Coleman says other players remain committed, even if their projects aren't as advanced, but warns that B.C.'s window of opportunity will close in the next five to seven years.
While some LNG proponents have urged the B.C. government to speed up its timetable for finalizing tax rules, Mr. Coleman is confident that tabling legislation this fall for the LNG tax regime will provide enough detail for projects to make their plans accordingly. "The LNG proponents want to know that they have a stable marketplace where they can nail down their numbers for the long term and compete worldwide on the investment they want to make," he says.
But for now, global LNG players have headed straight for Australia while Canada remains on the back burner.
Boomtown Gladstone
Located about an hour's flight north of Brisbane, Gladstone is no stranger to industry: It has been shipping goods to Asia for more than century.
Today, Gladstone has a population just over 62,000 and exports bauxite, aluminum and grain. For visitors, the first sign Gladstone is going through an energy rush comes at the airport. The lone baggage carousel is dwarfed by large advertisements for workers' compensation lawyers and scaffolding firms.
On Goondoon Street, the main drag, there are other signs that this is more than just a sleepy town.
There are the large, gleaming, cheerily staffed community outreach centres with displays, pamphlets and maps that seek to soothe the community's nerves. Stretched out along the small strip, there are separate buildings for the Santos-led Gladstone LNG venture, Australia Pacific LNG, BG Group-led Queensland Curtis LNG and another one for Shell.
The centres explain how LNG is better for the environment than other fossil fuels, show the safe double hulls of the LNG carriers and explain the fracking-style drilling that happens further inland. Hydraulic fracturing has created unease among Australia's cattle farmers, who fear their wells will be soiled by natural gas.
Almost everyone walking the streets, sitting in the restaurants or driving Toyota Hilux pickup trucks wears yellow fluorescent clothing. This is the "fluoro army" building Gladstone's LNG industry, a smattering of the 13,000 people who work on Curtis Island. Thousands go back and forth on huge ferries every morning and afternoon. They are so ubiquitous they even made an appearance as "high-vis zombies" in a musical performed by the waterside. "It was called Boomtown ," says Shane McLeod, a local real estate agent.
In the Santos building, marine and stakeholder manager Garry Scanlon leans over a diorama of the harbour and describes the effort that goes into building three separate LNG export terminals, all in the same place, all at the same time. The Gladstone port, which is already a big hub for coal exports, used to see on average 10,000 small ship movements within the harbour each year, he says. With each company now operating separate ferries and large vessels to move enormous LNG equipment prefabricated in Indonesia and the Philippines, that number has soared to 32,000 ship movements per month. "It's something you won't see again," he says.
The pace of development is so great the city has even attracted a foreign anthropologist who studies boomtowns.
"I'm interested in local responses to accelerated change," says Thomas Eriksen of the University of Oslo. "There's an upside and downside to everything."
Australia's head start
Gladstone, as impressive as its three LNG terminals seem in comparison with Canada, is just one part of Australia's broader LNG industry.
Elsewhere in the country, Australia already has three functioning LNG terminals. Including Gladstone's projects, there are a total of seven projects under construction, some of which could start shipping LNG in late 2014 or in 2015.
Several projects either under construction or proposed are located thousands of kilometres away in Western Australia. Darwin in the country's Northern Territory is another busy LNG site. These projects range from traditional offshore sites to the innovative "floating" LNG terminal being built by Shell. The gargantuan Gorgon project off the western coast is now estimated to cost a whopping $54-billion (U.S.).
Given the large number of projects, observers predict Australia will easily overtake Malaysia's LNG output soon and then push past Qatar to become the world's largest LNG exporter by 2018.
Lodged in the Asia-Pacific region, close to key Asian buyers, Australia also enjoys a geographic advantage over Canada.
However, the whopping $54-billion price tag on the Chevron-led Gorgon project, which has soared by 40 per cent since the original estimates, shows LNG infrastructure can be painfully costly.
High commodity prices in recent years flooded Australia with investment and drove up the Australian dollar while construction materials and labour costs soared.
The BG Group-led $20.4-billion QCLNG project at first was projected to cost $15-billion. Firms in Australia will need to cut costs if they want to remain competitive, particularly as the United States and Canada plow into LNG.
"Australia has a permanent shipping advantage to these markets because it is physically closer, but it is hampered by the highest costs in the world and some of the lowest productivity," says Geoffrey Cann, who heads Deloitte Australia's oil and gas consultancy out of Brisbane. "The shipping advantage is not much. You can chew through it in a hurry."
But even with high costs and low productivity, which could be damaging if global LNG prices drop in years ahead, Australian projects have a distinct advantage because of the head start. By 2015, many of these LNG projects will be operating with two "trains," or separate LNG cooling processes, but most LNG sites are approved for three or four production trains. Western Australia's $50-billion North West Shelf Venture (Woodside, BHP Billiton, BP PLC and others) already has five trains.
Expanding facilities is much cheaper than building new ones. That means Australian projects - with land already cleared, and jetties and storage tanks already built - will be fighting for sales contracts in Asia against brand new Canadian projects that have much higher startup costs.
"If they decided to expand the plants at the exact time that Canadian projects are trying to find buyers, they will absolutely compete," Mr. Cann says. "And it's much cheaper to expand than to find new buyers. This is why it's a bit of a foot race."
Mr. Cann suggests Canada's legislators could also learn from mistakes made already in Australia, where companies pursuing similar projects have duplicated infrastructure such as pipelines unnecessarily.
He also suggests firms looking at projects in Canada consider more advanced technology, such as Shell's massive, 488-metre-long floating LNG terminal Prelude.
Industry experts say there will be pressure for B.C. LNG projects to consolidate. Petronas, for instance, has held talks with BG Group to combine forces to build one pipeline from northeastern British Columbia to the coast instead of two.
Aboriginal rights
It is late afternoon on Goodoon Street when two members of the "fluoro army" swagger into the middle of the road and yell suggestively at a group of three women standing on the corner. "You got to see it first hand," Anita Street sighs. She and her friends describe a boomtown that has become increasingly hostile to women as workers flooded in for LNG projects. The women said they no longer go to clubs or bars any more because they get grabbed, and even while shopping in grocery stores they are ogled, hit on and heckled. "I have a son and they still do it," Ms. Street says.
Gladstone has weathered booms and busts before, but the sheer scale of the race in the global LNG industry has strained the city and the environment on a number of levels - as well as relationships with aboriginal groups, farmers and fishermen.
Mr. McLeod, the real estate agent, describes an increase in drug use, drunken fights and public urination downtown. Rents on some properties doubled or tripled quickly, to the point where the town opened nearby showgrounds so locals driven out of the housing market could live in RVs. Firms responded by building new houses and apartments, which in turn led to an oversupply of housing, and prices have fallen. "I'm born and bred local," Mr. McLeod says. "It's probably the largest boom we've seen."
One other explanation for firms' ability to push ahead in Australia is that rights for aboriginals are less entrenched than on Canada's West Coast, where failure to consult with affected groups can result in legal challenges and costly delays.
Wally Ingra, a community elder who has worked in the energy construction business for decades, says aboriginal groups elsewhere in Australia have had more success than local groups around Gladstone. "They're making massive amounts of money and nothing comes back into the community," he says. "They'll give us a sporting day. Oh, great. A sporting day."
In British Columbia, some aboriginal groups have already endorsed LNG exports, as long as projects meet or exceed environmental standards. Still, opposition remains. For instance, members of the Blueberry River First Nations are upset because they have been unable to persuade the provincial government to protect 80,000 hectares of land from LNG-related drilling for natural gas in northeastern B.C.
Besides the global competition from Australia, British Columbia is in a continental race to export LNG.
B.C. LNG projects face a disadvantage compared with U.S. proposals that have a head start because some infrastructure is already in place, notably those in the U.S. South, near the Gulf of Mexico. In some instances, it will be a matter of converting American facilities originally designed to handle LNG imports so that they are instead reconfigured for exports.
Mr. Coleman, B.C.'s Deputy Premier who is in charge of the LNG file, says he recognizes the high stakes amid competitive pressures from Australia and the United States.
"LNG projects did their own thing in Australia and they found that costs got out of hand. Companies have learned that they don't want that to happen in Canada, so there will be discussions here about how they can share certain things," he says. "Our job is to make sure we're globally competitive, which we are."

British Columbia is playing catch-up with Australia and the United States in the race to export liquefied natural gas, but the province believes its tax and regulatory regime will be competitive against its two main rivals.
The B.C. government commissioned Ernst & Young to see how the province stacks up against Australia and five states - Louisiana, Texas, Georgia, Oregon and Alaska. The EY report said that, on the low-end scenario for LNG export activity based on a hypothetical example of five plants, B.C. is essentially the same as Australia for collecting projected taxes and royalties over a 20-year period (roughly $160-billion in real 2012 dollars).
But the B.C. government argues that on the high-end estimate for comparing the tax and royalty frameworks, B.C. is lower than Australia, at roughly $280-billion versus Australia at $320-billion.
There are also other factors that go into companies' decisions on whether to forge ahead with LNG export terminals. Shipping distances, pipeline costs, the availability of natural gas and the status of consultations with First Nations are also important to keep in mind.
"It's a huge challenge to figure out a way to make these LNG projects competitive," says Byron Beswick, senior manager in EY's oil and gas practice in Calgary.
The soaring costs of Australian LNG projects are providing an opening for British Columbia's nascent industry to capture market share, according to analysts at RBC Dominion Securities Inc.
Canada could foster a more collaborative industry among various competitors, something Qatar was able to do when the pace of development drove costs too high, says Thomas Valentine, an international oil and gas lawyer with Norton Rose Fulbright's Calgary office.
Canada, unlike promising LNG projects developing in East Africa, has a stable regulatory and legal system, as well as local oil and gas expertise, but Mr. Valentine says investors may look elsewhere if Canadian policy makers don't start making decisions faster.
"What happens in Australia really does matter to what's happening in Canada," Mr. Valentine says. "If the Canadian projects don't really get engaged quickly, they could be left flat-footed."
Cheniere Energy Inc.'s Sabine Pass LNG project in Louisiana is the only LNG export project under construction so far in North America. There are nearly 30 LNG projects planned in the United States, but realistically, a half-dozen of them stand the best chance of getting built over the next five or six years.

Abstract: "As a young man at the beginning of this told me, 'Mr. [Adam Vaughan], You can fix this community but don't break the neighbourhood,'" Mr. Vaughan said. "We haven't always been here for Alexandra Park. As a government we haven't, as neighbours we haven't. But that has changed ... You'll see Alex Park residents getting skills and careers from the changes in the neighbourhood."

Full text:   It's right downtown, but it's a world unto itself. Now Toronto Community Housing is remaking the place, and many fear tearing down its walls will fracture the neighbourhood. Change, writes Joe Friesen, isn't easy for those who live there
Iveth Maita stood and watched as the demolition crew peeled back the roof of what used to be her home, exposing to the sky the bedrooms where her children once slept.
"I lived here almost 20 years. It's very sad," Ms. Maita said.
After nearly five years of planning and hundreds of meetings, the first segment of co-op and community housing units in the downtown Toronto neighbourhood of Alexandra Park have been torn down. They will be replaced by brand new townhouses, part of a massive, 10- to-15-year revitalization that will see 333 new rental units built, 473 units refurbished and 1,540 new private market condominiums on prime downtown land. All of it will be paid for by the condo developers at no cost to Toronto Community Housing.
Officially, the start of demolition back in February was meant to be a celebration. Dignitaries made speeches under a rented canopy. The property developer, the city councillor and many of the local residents basked in the occasion. Others, like Ms. Maita, had mixed feelings. They worry that the disruptions of this massive tearing-down and building up, not to mention the arrival of new condo-dwellers, will threaten the spirit of the community they've built. On the surface this is about building better public housing. But it's also about power and money. They're being asked to accommodate development - this is, after all, some of the most valuable real estate in the TCHC portfolio - but they'll get nicer homes and a new community centre in the deal.
Alexandra Park, to the outsider, is a hard-to-navigate warren of townhouses, apartment buildings and dead-end passageways. Located between Kensington Market and Queen Street, it feels as though the neighbourhood turns its back to the city, repelling passersby with its forbidding design and lack of through streets. That has been both a blessing and a curse. Residents appreciate the close-knit atmosphere it fosters, but at times it has made the community less safe.
The revitalization promises new streets to open up the area. One will connect Augusta from Dundas to Queen, while two others will run east-west between Cameron and Augusta. The intention is to embrace the city, said TCHC CEO Gene Jones. It will also make it easier to navigate for fire and police, who often complain that such large-scale housing projects, designed with closed pedestrian walks, allow crime to flourish.
Ms. Maita's home is gone now. There's nothing there but an empty field of dust, and "very nice memories," she said wistfully. Before leaving for a last time she had hugged and kissed the doorway as a farewell.
"My kids thought I was crazy," she says. "In my country, you live in the same house until you die."
Ms. Maita came to Canada as a refugee from Bolivia in the 1980s. She raised two children in Alexandra Park working a full-time job at the neighbourhood McDonald's, earning a little more than minimum wage. The local school was great for her kids and she appreciated being so close to Chinatown, Kensington and all the amenities of the city centre. But when the revitalization was announced, it became clear that some people would have to move, at least temporarily, to allow for demolition. Ms. Maita was one. She agreed, reluctantly, but she's not happy about it. She now lives on the 30th floor of a TCHC building near the waterfront. It's too high up for her and too far from the old neighbourhood, but it's new and clean.
When revitalization was first proposed six years ago, many residents were opposed. They had seen what had happened at Regent Park, the first in the recent wave of TCHC revitalization, and rejected the idea that people might be displaced to different neighbourhoods against their will. Zero displacement became the mantra. That mantra was repeated at hundreds of meetings, as everyone with a stake was consulted on a litany of details.
City councillor Adam Vaughan, who spoke at the ceremony in February, said he was always mindful of the community's wishes. Nothing would have happened without the community's consent, he said.
"As a young man at the beginning of this told me, 'Mr. Vaughan, You can fix this community but don't break the neighbourhood,'" Mr. Vaughan said. "We haven't always been here for Alexandra Park. As a government we haven't, as neighbours we haven't. But that has changed ... You'll see Alex Park residents getting skills and careers from the changes in the neighbourhood."
After Mr. Vaughan spoke, Ms. Maita wandered over to inspect the artist renderings of the new buildings, the SQ condo project slated for Queen and Cameron and the new townhouses where she hopes to live in three years' time. She let out a sigh.
"That's beautiful," she said. "I want one there. It looks like a very rich building."
That's certainly part of the appeal for residents.
Ahmed Hashimi, originally from Kandahar, Afghanistan, has lived in the neighbourhood for more than 20 years. He raised eight children here.
"It's sad to see," he said. "But we need new buildings. These ones are old."
Colleen Lavallee, a well-connected leader in the community, said she expects the positive outcomes from the revitalization will outweigh any short-run negatives. For one, the urban design will be more practical. For another, local youth will be hired for revitalization work as part of an economic development plan.
"The design is about clear sightlines, less turns and twists. But it's not just construction. I also see opportunities for our young people," Ms. Lavallee said. "When you come into these neighbourhoods to report on crime or whatever, they can do the math. They can see what rent in the city of Toronto costs, they can see what wage earners earn and they can see there's not very many opportunities for them. This is an opportunity to provide training, get them employed."
Kathleen Sousa is less optimistic. She has lived in the neighbourhood for 43 years, longer than nearly anyone else. She lives next door to the home where she grew up. It may be old, but a home is what you make it, she said.
"They're taking away community. And it's all for money. You mark my words. They say nothing is going to change, zero displacement. But you'll see," Ms. Sousa said.
Mr. Jones, the TCHC CEO, said there is a lot to be gained for Alex Park. The plan is to continue to work with residents to minimize the disruptions and maximize the benefits. He said the mixing of neighbourhoods, with community housing blending more closely with its surroundings, will boost the self-esteem and remove some of the stigma associated with living in public housing.
Ms. Maita has seen a lot of changes to the neighbourhood already. Queen West, the borderland to the south, is now a hopping commercial hub, and with the new condos going up that may spread north into Alex Park.
"A lot of new, good people. Nice things. Lots of money coming in," Ms. Maita said.
"It's good."

Full text:   At the Urban Land Institute annual meeting, one of the world's hottest real estate markets is on display
kgold@globeandmail.com
Andy Yan, a senior urban planner and adjunct professor at UBC, stood in front of about 50 American developers and planners at a workshop this week and watched their jaws drop. He compared Vancouver's median household income, about $57,000, alongside the average detached house price - $1.36-million.
"They were floored," Mr. Yan says. "We have profound economic challenges."
Mr. Yan was one of the presenters as the U.S.-based Urban Land Institute held its annual meeting this week in Vancouver, with 3,000 delegates from around the world descending on the convention centre.
It was the first time that the ULI held its spring conference outside of the U.S., and it was more than a symbolic gesture that Vancouver is, in real estate terms, one of the most economically thriving cities in the world.
"It's taken me five years of my life to get the conference here, and I'm pretty proud," says local architect Alan Boniface, chair of the BC chapter of the ULI. "I lobbied hard, to be frank. The poster child for the ULI is Vancouver - it has real estate up the ying yang, so that certainly helped."
From a global perspective, Vancouver is booming, a leading example of a thriving foreign real estate investment market. But as Vancouverites are well aware - and Mr. Yan pointed out - there's been a price to pay, particularly in the form of unaffordable housing.
Of the positives, says Mr. Yan, we can lay claim to smart use of surplus industrial land. Areas that were once dead zones, such as the Olympic Village/Flats and Railtown areas, are now destination neighbourhoods, made interesting because of tech, design and artisan industries that have set up shop. While several cities in the U.S. still suffer the repercussions of the recession, they look to Vancouver as an example of a city that's at the top of its game.
Mr. Boniface is an architect with the Vancouver office of national firm Dialog, and he's definitely feeling the love. Dialog is the firm responsible for Granville Island, which is, unbeknownst to nearly everybody, the second hottest tourist spot in Canada, outside Niagara Falls. It is the jewel of destination spots, with more than 12 million visitors traipsing through Granville Island each year.
Dialog architects Norm Hotson and Joost Bakker conceived of the master plan for the peninsula back in 1975, transforming it from industrial to mixed-use with an emphasis on local marketplace, education, arts and artisans, and gritty work life carried out in the open. They wanted a place that didn't hide its industry, and they elected to keep housing at its fringes to avoid any pushback from strata boards that might oppose the sights and sounds of it. Instead, Granville Island is surrounded by dense condo development that supports its economy. It's the perfect example of complementary mixed-use housing, industrial and retail development.
It was a hugely winning formula, which lead to Dialog helping other mixed use markets get off the ground, including Seattle's Pike Place, Ottawa's ByWard, and Toronto's St. Lawrence markets, and in the early days, the Distillery District. The firm is also helping with the new Great Northern Way neighbourhood that is anchored by the new Emily Carr University of Art and Design.
Now, Memphis, of all cities, has come calling, and Mr. Boniface finds himself the lead architect on a massive one- million-square-foot mixed-use project there that takes its inspiration from the Granville Island model.
"We're intellectualizing what we did right there so many years ago," Mr. Boniface says. "We did the master planning, the food markets, and we've been overseeing the place since its inception."
Memphis officials discovered Mr. Boniface when he gave a speech there two years ago to 300 people, including city planners, impressing them with his firm's "urban magnets" model of planning design. The idea is to create certain key components that will draw people to an area. On Granville Island, the magnets have been food, and all aspects of boating and art, for example. The aim is to prevent a sterile environment, which comes about from massive chain stores and too many cool high-end shops. Once those stores move in, the neighbourhood goes dead from a cultural perspective. Instead, the firm lobbied hard to keep blue-collar work, such as Granville Island's boat makers and the big concrete plant. It was a relatively low-cost project that made the most of old, cheaply constructed warehousing.
In Memphis, a group is doing the same with an old Sears distribution centre that's been sitting empty and derelict for 20 years.
"The Urban Magnets concept has now been implemented through our city government, through the planners," says Todd Richardson, project leader for Memphis's Crosstown development project.
"I love it, because I go and sit in on meetings through the mayor's office, and they don't know who I am. And they are talking about the Urban Magnets concept and how they have to implement it. They have no idea where it came from.
"They are implementing it because Memphis is a very blue-collar place, where we like to get our hands dirty. It's not a place where high-rises and high-level expensive development is going to be a success. Memphis is one of the poorest cities in the nation."
Mr. Richardson toured Granville Island last year and also checked out Toronto's Distillery District.
"It's not like Granville Island is an incredible architectural gem. But it's a mix that makes for a user experience that you can't get anywhere else."
Mr. Boniface concedes that Emily Carr's relocation from Granville Island will be a major setback. But Mr. Hotson and Mr. Bakker are working to find replacement tenants for the former campus, perhaps creative companies in the flourishing high-tech industry.
As he told the ULI conference Thursday, the idea is to plan these areas according to a specific vision.
"Most designers and developers don't think about things as cohesively, so it becomes kind of random, and it may not work because of that.
"Mostly, we want people to think about place making as a vehicle. I've spoken to all over the U.S. and Canada. And it's starting to get some life. People are starting to understand it. In Memphis they enacted a bylaw called the Urban Magnet Bylaw. In Nashville, the Urban Land Institute there is taking the idea and trying to apply it.
"So everywhere it lands, it seems to sprout a bit."

The Lash Group of Companies is developing a master-planned community in Scarborough with amenities and attractions it hopes will tempt buyers and locals alike to head outside more frequently for a stroll, skate or swim.
Just a five-minute drive east of Scarborough Town Centre, the contemporary high-rise project will house private suites, townhouses, shops and recreational facilities, including a state-of-the-art public park.
"We're creating a little city here," says president and CEO Larry Blankenstein. "And we're working with the city in building a million-dollar ... water park and adult fitness centre."
Condominium residents will have exclusive use of lounges, a theatre and rooms designated for parties, dining and fitness, plus a rooftop terrace with a pool, barbecues, tanning and seating areas.
"One of the things we think is unique to our building is that it has a pond that will convert to a skating rink, as well as a gaming room, rooftop deck and celebrity kitchen," Mr. Blankenstein adds. "You're getting all the luxuries you'd normally see in a downtown building out in Scarborough."
Turner Fleischer Architects Inc. will design the four-building community, which is named ME Living after the first initials of Markham and Ellesmere roads, where the developer will replace a rental building with a new one and three condominium towers.
"This is the first development in that area," says Mr. Blankenstein. "We feel it's a very underutilized area of the GTA. With the expansion of the subways/LRT, it will create a lot of development in the area."
In the immediate vicinity, there are parks and schools, including Centennial College and University of Toronto's Scarborough campus, in addition to restaurants, shops and supermarkets.
"The appeal of it is the proximity to transportation nodes: [Highway] 401 is less than two minutes away, Scarborough Town Centre is less than five minutes away and you're at major transit lines at Markham and Ellesmere," Mr. Blankenstein states.
For the project's first phase, buyers can select from 287 suites in a 24-storey tower and eight-storey podium. There will be one and two-bedroom plans, some with dens, and each with floor-to-ceiling windows and outdoor space.
"It's a very family-oriented community," Mr. Blankenstein adds. "If people want larger units, we can always look at combining units together."
Tanner Hill Associates Inc. conceived the interior design package with plank laminate floors, pile carpeting, porcelain and ceramic tile finishes, as well as granite kitchen counters, European-style cabinetry and appliances, including laundry machines.
Monthly fees will be 52 cents per square feet. Larger units will come with parking and a locker.
Move in dates begin December, 2016.

Abstract: Gaby Poirier, general manager of B.C. operations for Rio Tinto Alcan, said Kitimat is enjoying a streak of good fortune. Over the past decade, the local economy suffered hundreds of job losses amid declines in the methanol, fisheries and forestry sectors. "Kitimat is going from doom town to boom town," Mr. Poirier said. "If any LNG projects become true and get built, it will be great news."

Full text:   Promise of B.C. energy projects has property prices rising, and the once depressed community preparing for an influx of new residents
Forget Vancouver and Toronto. Canada's hot real estate market is the hard-luck community of Kitimat in northwestern British Columbia.
Housing prices are surging in Kitimat as the economy gathers steam with preliminary work on liquefied natural gas projects and the construction of an aluminum smelter.
The real estate revival is emerging even though no final investment decisions have been made yet to proceed with building LNG export terminals. Still, hundreds of millions of dollars are being spent on advance work, notably site preparation in the case of the Kitimat LNG project co-owned by the Canadian units of Chevron Corp. and Apache Corp.
In Kitimat, average prices for properties in the first three months of this year soared to $289,533, up 71 per cent from $169,255 in the same quarter in 2013, according to data on the Multiple Listing Service for residential, commercial and industrial transactions. Prices for Kitimat's single-family detached homes that sold in the first quarter averaged $321,786, up 70 per cent from the first three months of 2013. Median year-over-year prices for detached houses in March jumped 53 per cent.
The economy in northwestern British Columbia has been on the upswing since 2012, when construction began for Rio Tinto Alcan's massive modernization project at its aluminum smelter site in Kitimat. Rio Tinto Alcan aims to transition to the new smelter and replace the old one in 2015. Nearly 1,200 people work in operations at the 60-year-old smelter.
Gaby Poirier, general manager of B.C. operations for Rio Tinto Alcan, said Kitimat is enjoying a streak of good fortune. Over the past decade, the local economy suffered hundreds of job losses amid declines in the methanol, fisheries and forestry sectors. "Kitimat is going from doom town to boom town," Mr. Poirier said. "If any LNG projects become true and get built, it will be great news."
At least four energy projects are planned for Kitimat in the race to export LNG to Asia.
So far, 14 proponents have emerged with plans to send B.C. LNG by tankers to customers overseas, although industry experts caution that only three or four export terminals at most will get built in the province. A dozen of the 14 proposals are focused on the northwestern part of the province while two are planned in the southwest.
In Terrace, the retail and services hub in northwestern British Columbia, resale prices for detached homes averaged $294,067 in the first quarter, up 30 per cent from the first three months of 2013. In the port city of Prince Rupert, which has also suffered its share of setbacks over the years, average quarterly prices for detached houses edged up 2.4 per cent to $190,461.
Re/Max real estate agent John Evans said it's about time that some prosperity graced Terrace, Kitimat, Prince Rupert and other small municipalities in the resource-dependent area. "This region has been in the hole for a long time. The majority of my 28-year career has been spent in a depressed economy," he said from Terrace. "In the early 2000s, most of my work was on foreclosures."
Rio Tinto Alcan, which decided in late 2011 to spend $3.3-billion (U.S.) on the new Kitimat aluminum smelter, is two-thirds of the way through construction. In the final push, 3,000 construction workers will be on site during the peak of building activity. About 450 Kitimat construction workers and 100 crew and guests will be housed for the next nine months on a leased cruise ship that arrived last month.
Kitimat's population dwindled from 10,285 in 2001 to 8,335 in the 2011 census. Government officials estimate that the year-round population easily surpassed 9,000 people last year, and even if only a couple of LNG projects get the go ahead, the community will need to prepare for a wave of thousands of new residents over the next several years.
Rental vacancy rates in Kitimat exceeded 44 per cent in 2005, but rates tumbled last year to near zero for availability. Some Kitimat landlords who once charged monthly rent of $600 (Canadian) for an apartment have renovated their units and recently started to collect $1,500 a month.

Turmoil in Vancouver: GM's firing highlights pressures of owning an NHL team in Canada

Abstract: The Aquilinis' statements skirt how the hiring played out. Mr. [Mike Gillis] last year had invited the Aquilinis into interviews with various coaches. The family, according to a person with direct knowledge of the events, was particularly taken with Mr. [John Tortorella], who had been fiery in the past. They saw a coach who could revive an underperforming hockey team. The Aquilinis wanted Mr. Tortorella, and Mr. Gillis and the other hockey executives came to the same conclusion.

Full text:   On Monday night in Vancouver, as the Canucks put on a woeful performance and were eliminated from the playoffs for the first time in six years, fans brayed for the ouster of the team president and general manager, chanting: Fire Gillis.
On Tuesday morning, fans got what they wanted. After a downward spiral this year, with a roster of players assembled by Mike Gillis and overseen by new coach John Tortorella, the blame was pinned on Mr. Gillis, and he was fired. A "new voice is needed," team chairman and co-owner Francesco Aquilini said.
The declaration, which represented a dramatic disavowal of responsibility for what has gone wrong with the Vancouver Canucks, has forced the wealthy Aquilini family into a spotlight it has long tried to avoid. And it has thrown into sharp relief the enormous pressures of running a hockey team in a Canadian city - especially in one that recently came so close to winning the Stanley Cup.
Much of the distancing revolves around the hiring of Mr. Tortorella, whose reputation as a firebrand and penchant to coach defensive hockey made him a controversial choice last year. On Monday, Francesco Aquilini sent a Globe and Mail reporter a text message warning of legal action after the newspaper published a story discussing the family's involvement in the hiring.
"I read your article today. You are a prick," it said. Two hours later, a legal letter from the family's counsel arrived by e-mail. It alleged defamation, sought a retraction and an apology, and threatened further action.
"The facts are that while the Aquilinis supported the decision of the General Manager, the hiring decision was his and not theirs," lawyer Howard Shapray of Vancouver-based Shapray Cramer Fitterman Lamer LLP wrote in the legal letter to The Globe.
The legal push also took aim at The Province newspaper in Vancouver, which several weeks earlier in a column had mentioned the Aquilinis' role in the Tortorella hiring. Mr. Shapray on Monday sent a legal letter to The Province and made similar demands as were made of The Globe.
The Aquilinis' statements skirt how the hiring played out. Mr. Gillis last year had invited the Aquilinis into interviews with various coaches. The family, according to a person with direct knowledge of the events, was particularly taken with Mr. Tortorella, who had been fiery in the past. They saw a coach who could revive an underperforming hockey team. The Aquilinis wanted Mr. Tortorella, and Mr. Gillis and the other hockey executives came to the same conclusion.
The Globe sought Mr. Aquilini's comment last week but did not hear back.
The Aquilini family's vast wealth was started from nothing by patriarch Luigi, an immigrant from Italy in the 1950s. The money was made in construction and real estate, and as the fortune grew, the Aquilinis guarded their privacy. It was a desire they held fast to even after buying the hockey team in a hockey-mad city a decade ago.
The Aquilinis were always there, however. Occasionally, it was in public, court room battles, the locker room, or at a press conference - but mostly they operated in the background. Francesco Aquilini would often be on the telephone daily with Mr. Gillis. In March, as the team considered trading star player Ryan Kesler, Mr. Aquilini was closely involved.
When the Vancouver Canucks lost Game 7 of the Stanley Cup final on home ice three years ago, Francesco Aquilini was with his players in the locker room after the defeat. There were tears on his face, and anger in his voice, cursing at a television reporter seeking his reaction.
On Wednesday, Francesco Aquilini will have a press conference at the arena at 10:30 a.m. It is hard to imagine he will sit there alone. Rumours swirl that former star Trevor Linden will become the new team president. Bob Nicholson, who just stepped down as head of Hockey Canada, is another candidate.
Through the fire, Mr. Tortorella may well survive. The owners backed him even after a confrontation in January involving the Calgary Flames that got the coach suspended by the league for 15 days. The owners were jarred, but still admired Mr. Tortorella.
Last June, Francesco Aquilini attended the press conference that announced the hiring of Mr. Tortorella, but stayed quiet in the back.
Mr. Gillis was asked about the owners' involvement and he said the new coach was among the biggest decisions the team had made in several years, and it would be unrealistic for the owners not to be involved.
"At the end of the day," Mr. Gillis said last June, "we were both unanimous in our selection and who we thought the best coach moving forward would be, and it was John Tortorella."

UPS AND DOWNS
The true and weird history of the Vancouver Canucks
Early 1970s : The team's original owner is an American from Minnesota, Tom Scallen, a P.T. Barnum-type. He did not last long. He was jailed for securities fraud connected with a public offering of shares in the hockey team. Mr. Scallen served nine months and thereafter was deported. Mr. Scallen was eventually pardoned.
1982 : A subpar Canucks team makes a lucky run to the Stanley Cup final and is swept by the New York Islanders.
1994 : A so-so Canucks team, led by Trevor Linden, makes a surprise run to the Stanley Cup final, loses in Game 7 to the New York Rangers, and the city riots.
Late 1990s : The second owner of the team, the local Griffiths family, loses control of the team, crushed by debt when they built what is now called Rogers Arena and took on a National Basketball Association franchise, the Grizzlies. An American, again, takes over, the telecom billionaire John McCaw Jr.
2004 : The local Aquilini family buys half the team and buys the rest two years later.
2011 : A superb Canucks team makes a predicted run to the Stanley Cup final and leads 2-0, and 3-2, but loses the series to the Boston Bruins 4-3. The city riots.

LISTING AGENT
Ian Watt/Sutton Group West Coast Realty
The Action The purchasers are a local New Westminster professional couple whose kids had moved out, but who didn't want to live downtown, says listing agent Ian Watt.
The previous owner had completely transformed the condo - including scraping all the popcorn stucco off the ceilings - and attempted to flip it, but Mr. Watt isn't sure he'd have made a profit.
"People think they can do it," he says.
"But you have to realize there's not much profit after you pay the Property Transfer Tax and commissions."
What They Got The 2,248- square-foot penthouse in this 23-year-old building with panoramic views was completely gutted and refinished.
* The unit has 500 square feet of balcony space, more than 1,000 square feet in the living and family rooms, three bedrooms, 31/2 bathrooms, a formal dining room, and space for four.
* It also has three parking stalls - a rarity.
* The penthouse is close to the Westminster Quay promenade and SkyTrain.
The Agent's Take "New West Quay is changing so much," says Mr. Watt.
"Last spring I sold a $2-million penthouse there, which is - I think - for 2013, the most expensive place sold in New West. So people are starting to look at New West as this place for new growth.
"If this penthouse was downtown, it would have been $3-million."

Full text:   A Vancouver architectural firm adds density to the city's oldest neighbourhood, while maintaining a link to the past
Strathcona sits like a heritage-rich residential island, surrounded by a sea of new high-density development in Chinatown and the Hastings Corridor.
Vancouver's oldest residential neighbourhood, it offers turn of the century railway houses, former rooming houses turned into artists studios, parks, cafes and more than a hundred years of multicultural history.
But with property prices rising and encroaching development pressure, the area that has survived freeways and decades of urban blight has required new design solutions, ones that both respect the heritage feel and idiosyncratic weave of the neighbourhood and also address a growing city's need for densification.
Nick Sully and Dwayne Smyth, partners in the architecture firm Shape, recently completed a five-year project based on principles they call eco-heritage, which they suggest could well become a model for future development in transitioning urban areas.
"We want to regenerate not gentrify," Mr. Sully says, who was the project architect for the development that converted two heritage houses on Union Street into seven residential units.
Purchased by a couple in 2007, who wanted to convert the property into both revenue generating units as well as one to house an aging parent, the clients' mandate was also to create something green and cutting edge, while preserving the heritage grain.
A tall order, but not, as it turned out, an impossible one. Working within city heritage guidelines that allowed for up to seven units on the consolidated lot, and assisted by a provincial SENC (Super Efficient New Construction) grant given for the renovation and upgrading of existing heritage homes, the architects have created nothing less than a new prototype for an urban micro-community: one that is home to a variety of housing types, income levels and generations.
It was a five-year journey, one that overcame initial nimbyism - it's one thing to support civic green and densification efforts in theory and another to live next door to them - by smart design and ongoing community consultation.
Concerns about shadows from the building were mitigated by scaling back mass and form, maximizing frontage and achieving a balance between public and private spaces. Now that construction is complete the complex is a source of neighbourhood pride.
Many curious locals wander into the inner mews area that leads to a central courtyard, atypical of the traditional single family neighbourhood and a clever extension of the streetscape on Union Street, which happens to be the city's busiest bicycle path.
Mr. Sully initially moved the two heritage houses to the back of the property and built two ground-floor, front-facing units, before moving them back on top. So the approach to the multi-family dwelling still bears the framework of a single family residence, with remilled wooden cladding closely matching the original in style and colour.
But a concrete façade on the bottom units and pathway leading into a central inner courtyard beckon the eye toward the south facing units that make the development so distinct.
Essentially what Mr. Sully has created is a modernist version of Georgian-style townhouses married to a courtyard house typology- not a bad hybrid for a half-Asian former British colony like Vancouver.
He has maximized space by employing a centralized underground mechanical area that services all seven units and by creating vertical space, in the absence of horizontal. Transparent stairwells that connect the three levels enjoyed by the three south-facing units anchored by lightwells and accented by skylights, serve to open up the space and amplify the relatively small square footages.
While the four north facing units enjoy city views, as well as the ever-flowing river of bicycle traffic, the south facing units face an inner courtyard. Viewed from the courtyard looking north, the white pitched roofs of the original houses rise above the black, cement clad flat roofed units that have solar hot water heaters, presenting an intriguing study in geometrical and generational interplay.
By staggering unit heights and inverting interior layouts, the dwellings were given individuality and privacy. The 750-square-foot residence on the east side of the lot has the bedroom on the sunken ground floor, the kitchen/living area on the second and a rooftop deck accessed by a skylight hatch on the third. Its sister unit to the east, features a south facing sunken patio and kitchen/living area on the ground floor and a bedroom and bathroom on top.
Meanwhile, the 1,600-square-foot three-storey laneway infill where the owners/developers reside, features so many lightwells and skylights that artificial light is almost never used during the daytime. Its minimalist palette of white-oak flooring, polished concrete, aluminum grating and steel amplifies interior space, while ample glazing drinks in the gritty grain of the laneway, textured weave of surrounding heritage homes and rich green of a towering cedar tree.
The third floor retains the coziness of a garret with the levity of a light-filled aerie. Glimpses of neighbouring Edwardian gables speak to the area's past, while views of the towers lining nearby Main Street evoke a city of the future.

Full text:   Losers in eight bidding wars, a Toronto couple tried every strategy they could think of before finally landing a house
cireland@globeandmail.com
For aspiring home buyers in Toronto who have lost out on one house after another, Aviva Levy and Adam Walman offer some words of encouragement: Hang in there.
"We lost eight bidding wars," says Ms. Levy of the couple's adventures in Riverdale. "We're now there and we're really happy." Last year at this time the pair was mired in despair.
"We were rookies," says Ms. Levy of their introduction to multiple offers. At first they thought that offering the full asking price might be enough to beat their rivals.
After a few bidding skirmishes, they were so discouraged that they approached the landlord of the house they had rented and offered to buy it from him. They left notes on the doors of houses they liked, asking homeowners if they would like to sell.
They tried a few bully offers on properties that were actually on the market. That tactic didn't get them a house either.
Mr. Walman, who is a commercial real estate agent, tried his hand on the residential side and presented offers himself. He did his best to persuade the sellers that the couple would make great custodians of a well-loved home.
Ms. Levy told her husband she was going to fire him and hire another agent after one particularly disappointing loss.
"I think I put a lot of pressure on him," she now says ruefully.
Part of their dissatisfaction stemmed from the fact that they kept shelling out money for home inspections and still ending up without a house.
Finally, in the ninth round of competition, they prevailed over eight other bidders and signed the deal on a detached house on Woodycrest.
Nobody could believe it - including the home inspector and employees at the local bank branch who had commiserated with Ms. Levy every time she returned a certified cheque uncashed.
"I was shocked," says Ms. Levy. "By the end, we were so used to losing, everyone was shocked."
The winning strategy, says Ms. Levy was to go in with no conditions and a healthy chunk above the asking price of $700,000. The couple had their financing preapproved and had done yet another home inspection before the offer date.
In fact, Ms. Levy acknowledges that they may have lucked out sooner if they had been willing to extend their search beyond Riverdale but they badly wanted to live in the neighbourhood along the Danforth. The young couple had gotten to know the area while renting when Ms. Levy was in graduate school, and they liked the parks, amenities and access to transit.
Ms. Levy and Mr. Walman were also intent on buying a detached house with parking. Supply was very limited, laments Ms. Levy, because so many of the houses on Woodycrest and nearby streets are semi-detached.
Where they were willing to compromise was on the size and condition of the property. If they got into the right neighbourhood, they figured, they could improve the house. They began to look in lower price brackets so that they would be able to offer a greater amount above asking.
They bought a house that has a large backyard but a small footprint. Typically people who buy these compact houses put on an addition, Ms. Levy says, and the couple may be able to do that eventually.
Also, they had been living in a rental condo, so they actually have more space now.
"For us, this is a big house for two people," says Ms. Levy. "Compared with our 600-square-foot condo, it feels massive."
Now that they have the house, the couple is finding it takes up a lot of time, says Ms. Levy. They also faced some unexpected expenses. A tree fell on the house not long after they moved in, which resulted in a big insurance claim. Then they found out their fence is encroaching on a neighbour's property.
Mr. Walman is taking courses on plumbing and electrical repair at George Brown College so that they can save some money when things break down.
But they're very pleased they made the move.
Joan Watkins, a real estate agent with Right at Home Realty Inc., says some pockets in the east end of Toronto are very hot right now, including streets near near Greenwood and the Danforth.
She recently sold a house at 136 Monarch Park Ave. for $741,000. The semi-detached, renovated house lasted only three days when it hit the market with an asking price of $575,000.
Ms. Watkins says the location of the house - just one block from the Bloor-Danforth subway line and with a walk score of 92 - appealed to the buyers in this case.
"When the buyers bought it, they couldn't get close enough to the subway."
While the sellers got 129 per cent of the asking price, she notes that many houses in the area have sold recently for 120 or 125 per cent of the asking price.
Ms. Watkins, who has been selling real estate for 32 years, says micro-hoods tend to swing in and out of favour.
For a while, Monarch Park Avenue and the surrounding area lost some buyers to Leslieville, which for a time gained a reputation as a place to find an affordable house in the east end, Ms. Watkins says.
Now values in Leslieville have swelled and buyers have a renewed interest in being close to the subway at Greenwood and the Danforth.
At one time, she adds, house hunters might have considered Monarch Park Avenue a busy street, but in this case, after one day on the market, the sellers were resisting a bully offer.
"That seems to have changed," she says of the willingness to live in a bustling area.

Full text:   Block 32 shows that the architecture of social housing can be fresh and contemporary
jmays@globeandmail.com
Though it's been interesting and sometimes exciting, the ongoing pop-up of new residential towers across Toronto has not been accompanied by a parallel deepening of social conscience. I see little indication, for instance, that the citizenry's concern about the disadvantaged among us, the underhoused and homeless, has increased to keep pace with the building boom.
A local publically funded agency that does embody what concern there is, however, and that's doing something practical about it, is the Toronto Community Housing Corp.
This organization, as every Torontonian knows, has come under fire from pundits and politicians during the past few years for alleged offences ranging from bad eviction policy to wasting taxpayers' money.
But whatever TCHC may be doing wrong - I'll let the experts decide the merits of the case - the agency has accomplished one thing that deserves celebration. It has abandoned, in at least some of its new construction projects, traditional social housing's warehouse-like aesthetic in favour of architectural styling that is fresh and contemporary, and as urbane as that of any market-rate condominium stack.
Case in point: Block 32, TCHC's recently opened $90-million social-housing complex located at the western edge of the mammoth Concord CityPlace condominium scheme, in deep downtown Toronto.
Designed by a team led by Shirley Blumberg, partner in the well-known firm KPMB Architects, in collaboration with Page + Steele/IBI Group Architects, the 428-unit project is as artistically well-considered and svelte as anything at CityPlace, if not more so. The handsomely tailored 35-storey tower rises gracefully from a boxy, but elegant, eight-level podium.
Block 32's composition is completed by an array of mid-rise structures that frame the spacious landscaped courtyard just west of the podium.
Interior spaces set aside for the residents' pleasure and convenience - a laundry, a games room, meeting places, a community kitchen, and so on - add up to about 7,300 square feet, while an outside area of nearly 22,000 square feet is available for good-weather recreation, barbequing, gardening and other sociable activities. If more amenity is wanted, artist and author Douglas Coupland's smart, imaginative Canoe Landing Park is right across the street.
But there's that name. Though I'm sure TCHC didn't intend it to have this effect, Block 32 sounds like something on the campus of a penitentiary - exactly what you don't want a public-housing project to be. The agency can certainly come up with a more attractive handle, and I hope they do so.
At a glance, in fact, the name is the only thing that makes this complex seem different from any luxury condo high-rise KPMB might do in Toronto.
The significant differences between this building and a normal market-rate Toronto condo arrangement become more obvious, however, when you look inside.
Instead of little units chiefly suitable for single people and childless couples - the usual inhabitants of nearby CityPlace - about half the apartments in Block 32 feature three, four or five bedrooms. Private developers occasionally say that families don't want to live in apartments downtown, so there's no market for ample suites. The fact that every unit in Block 32, including the big ones, is taken seems to argue the opposite.
Price, however, not urbanity, is the main reason people want to live at this address. Even if inner-city condominiums with more than three bedrooms were available, which they aren't, they would carry price-tags in the millions. The average rent for a four-bedroom suite measuring 1,552 square feet in Block 32, on the other hand, is $1,550 per month. A one-bedroom apartment rents for just under $1,000. Families who qualify for rental plans geared to income can pay as little as $85 a month, and do not pay more than $1,167.
Meeting TCHC's criteria for participation in its affordable-rent program is, as you can imagine, hard to do. Even so, tens of thousands of people have made their way onto the organization's waiting list for shelter.
Only about 1,500 men, women and children could be accommodated at Block 32. There is clearly still a great need for homes for the multitude of citizens whom Toronto's hot real-estate market has left out in the cold.
But while it doesn't solve the housing problem all in one go, Block 32 is a solid contribution to the city's affordable rental stock, and that's a step in the right direction. And by making spirited, convincing modern design a priority, TCHC also sets a good creative precedent for whatever the agency does next, and for the dwellings built by other Canadian public-sector providers. Social housing does not have to be artistically pedestrian, as it has been for too long. Block 32 shows how much better it can be.

Full text:   I'm a flight-attendant homebody, he's a tied-down adventurer. But when I travel with my husband his enthusiasm is contagious
Of my darling husband's quirks, this has to be my favourite: We'll be visiting some exotic, or even not-so-exotic, destination and at some part of the trip I know he will declare, "I could totally live here!"
With the strength of 10 elephants and years of practice, I refrain from rolling my eyes. Instead, I look lovingly at him as if he is saying it for the very first time and I ask: "Really, darling? Why is that?"
Of course the answers vary. Sometimes his love of jazz will have coloured his emotions: After a night out in some cool spot listening to a jazz ensemble he'll be ready to pack his bags and change postal codes.
Our perspectives differ a bit on such things. Scott has always lived in Toronto and does not travel as often as he would like. I grew up in Jamaica, live in Toronto and travel extensively for my job as a flight attendant.
After numerous days away, I am always happy to embrace the familiarity of home. I could never entertain the thought of living anywhere else. In Toronto, we have four sets of dear friends within popping-in distance. (My husband concedes that in a perfect world he'd be surrounded by his friends in his location of choice.)
Our first trip together was to Halifax. We stayed at a cozy bed and breakfast and ate copious amounts of fresh seafood. After a particularly delicious lobster dinner in a restaurant overlooking the water, my husband declared he was ready to pack up and move house.
In Ottawa for the Grey Cup, it happened after our visit to the Byward Market.
In Hawaii, it was after playing 18 holes on a glorious course on Oahu's North Shore.
In Vancouver, it took a stroll on the beach in White Rock in temperate March weather to capture his fickle attention.
In San Diego, it happened as we took in the Fourth of July fireworks sipping clam chowder to keep us warm.
He fell in love with Jamaica after a home-cooked meal of codfish fritters in my sister's kitchen, followed by a perfectly ripe papaya picked from a tree just outside her back door. As we ate, a hummingbird flitted in and out of the open window and I saw the all-too-familiar look in my husband's eyes. It was tough talking him out of it that time, as part of my heart still yearns for my childhood home.
After a lovely weekend in Muskoka, Scott actually arranged for a friend who is a real-estate agent to give us a tour of a cottage that was on sale. It was only my not-so-gentle reminder that it would take him three hours to get to work every day that swayed him.
Trips to Orlando and New York, though enjoyable, didn't speak to his sensibilities, and so his familiar refrain was not to be heard. I was spared the task of being the voice of reason.
Our last trip, just this past month, was to London. It was a short visit, and a little impromptu, to celebrate our anniversary.
We packed a lot into those four days: double-decker bus tours, theatre in Leicester Square, numerous pubs and quaint little bistros were visited at a feverish pace. We navigated the transit system with ease and asked directions of friendly strangers when required.
I noticed my husband was dressing a little bit differently than he does at home. He wore his usual tweed cap, but added an old long raincoat of his dad's to his ensemble. I thought he may have been watching too many British TV mystery series, as he did bear a little resemblance to a police inspector covering a case. He was in his element at the Sherlock Holmes Museum, posing with Sherlock's cap and pipe.
Strangely, after three days in one of my favourite cities he still had not expressed his desire to pack up house and move to London. I was beginning to think I didn't know him nearly as well as I'd thought after our 13 years together.
On the day before we left, I woke him up early. It was a bright, crisp day. The 6 C temperature felt positively balmy after the bone-chilling temperatures we had left behind in Toronto.
We walked along the canal to Camden Town and had a full English breakfast at a local pub. We navigated the twists and turns of the Camden Market, enjoying the assault on our various senses: the smells of spices and old books, the sounds of music by the Beatles and Rolling Stones emanating from record stores.
We stood on a bridge looking down at colourful houseboats and Camden Lock. And then, finally, there it was: "I could definitely see us living here!" he announced.
I gave him my usual speech about the grass being greener, the difference between visiting somewhere and living somewhere, blah, blah, blah. And of course I also pointed out that he's said the same thing about almost everywhere we have been on vacation.
We walked back to our hotel hand in hand, admiring some of the grand homes that border the river. First one and then another person stopped to ask us for directions. My husband looked at me proudly as I answered with the knowledge I've gained from the numerous times I've visited the city.
"You know what?" I said. "I could totally live here!"

Abstract: "It's an exciting new development and a great contribution to the neighbourhood," Leanore Sally, executive director of the Gastown Business Improvement Society, says of the plans for Ormidale. The current high-tech trend is not just about "big companies," she observes, but also, "startups and cultural creatives - young urbanites attracted by the dynamism of the area - not only the cafes and restaurants and clubs but also by the easy transit and bike access."

Full text:   Century Group aims its A-class revitalization of 1900-era Ormidale Block in Vancouver at high-tech clients
The 100 block of West Hastings that straddles the line between Gastown and the Downtown Eastside is one of the most rapidly gentrifying streets in Vancouver. Its transition from down-and-out to up-and-coming, spearheaded by the 2009 redevelopment of the Woodward's building, can be seen in its idiosyncratic weave of historic architecture, trendy new restaurants, dollar stores and money marts.
A gym called Revamp offers a hopeful neighbourhood narrative as a colourful-looking character washes the windows for the newly buffed and toned. Now, some of the crumbling Edwardian buildings in the area are following suit.
At 151 West Hastings, the Ormidale Block, a commercial redevelopment project by Vancouver-based Century Group that will get under way this spring, is a unique fusion of old and new, heritage and high tech that may well offer a new neighbourhood model.
The developer is betting on finding a high-tech tenant who does not want a Class A office look, but does want modern amenities.
The transformation of the terra-cotta-tiled building, poised between the Flack Block, a study in heritage preservation-conversion by Robert Fung-Salient Group, and the new Goldcorp Centre for the Arts, offers an inventive take on how to fit a contemporary building into a historical context.
"We didn't want to fetishize heritage, or to make the building look deliberately old," says project architect Michael Wartman of B & H, who adds he was inspired by Rafael Moneo's city hall in Murcia, Spain. Instead, working with heritage consultant Donald Luxton, they identified what was worth keeping in the Romanesque Revival building designed by George W. Grant and built in 1900, and what was not.
"Since the interior of the building had no real redeeming features," Mr. Wartman says of the building's innards that had already been through two rather unfortunate renos, "we decided to just keep the heritage facade on Hastings Street." A number of features that have been lost over time will be restored including a detailed bay window and a large glass-and-steel storefront that features curved glass panels at the entry.
The interior will feature open-plan, loft-like offices with exposed wood-decked ceilings and concrete radiant floor heating-cooling. Working within the confines of the narrow site bounded on three sides will make construction challenging, Mr. Wartman says, with materials lifted in by crane. But apart from a few small seismic gaps with neighbouring buildings that were easily remedied, the site is being used to advantage, with the sloping laneway allowing for an additional floor of commercial space in the back facing West Cordova Street.
The architect's mandate was to create something that respected the heritage grain of the 19-acre neighbourhood, which includes about 100 commercial buildings, while maximizing the energy efficiency and comfort factor demanded of Century Group's demographic target: the new creative arts and technology sector that is making Gastown a budding high-tech hub.
With TED moving its main talks from Long Beach, Calif., to Vancouver for at least two years, and George Lucas locating his Industrial Light and Magic studios here, the timing is right.
Maurice Ouellette, the architect-turned-developer who is vice-president of Century Group's corporate development, saw the potential of the owner-occupied building. "I went for a walk in the area in the spring of 2012," he notes of the environs across from Victory Square and the historic Dominion building, "and asked a Colliers agent if the building might ever become available."
Within six weeks it was acquired by Century Group, a largely suburban developer looking for a property that would place them in a more urban context, at a $7-million sale price with $11-million budgeted for renovation.
With a reputation for being environmentally and community minded, Century Group also hopes to contribute to the area's balanced growth, says Brett Walsh, director of real estate finance. "You really have to credit the City of Vancouver's vision in terms of not 'sanitizing' this area," a fate he notes has befallen historic-zoned quarters in many cities, such as San Diego, where the mix of "high-end restaurants and upscale condos feels disconnected and antiseptic."
A key to keeping the area vibrant, he says, is actively encouraging commercial real estate activity that once made the neighbourhood the city's first downtown, before suburban flight and the demise of the streetcar pushed commerce westward and drug and poverty problems ensued.
While open drug use still takes place in the area, the street-smart grit of the neighbourhood is seen as a plus for hipster high-tech clients who value "authenticity."
"It's an exciting new development and a great contribution to the neighbourhood," Leanore Sally, executive director of the Gastown Business Improvement Society, says of the plans for Ormidale. The current high-tech trend is not just about "big companies," she observes, but also, "startups and cultural creatives - young urbanites attracted by the dynamism of the area - not only the cafes and restaurants and clubs but also by the easy transit and bike access."
With the high-tech sector driving a mini commercial real estate boom in Gastown - where square footage is cheaper than downtown - landlords have to respond to the demands of the millennial work force. Drafty heritage buildings that swelter in summer do not fit the bill. So the architectural challenge is to create a new purpose-built, energy-efficient building that still respects the scale and heritage.
The renovated Ormidale Block will offer a new modern entrance on the sloping laneway, with double-height ground-floor retail space designed with restaurant-ready kitchen and ventilation systems.
Inspired by Seattle's Olson Kundig Architects use of weathered steel, Mr. Wartman decided to clad the back of the building with the same material to fit in with the grittiness of the laneway and the SRO building next door. A shimmering steel mesh canopy over the entry will peel back historic layers to reveal a new focus.
The six floors and 39,500 square feet of commercial space will feature a high-performance envelope and cutting-edge mechanical system that will provide more fresh air circulation than any other downtown building. Shared access to a 4,800-square-foot green rooftop deck, bike racks, showers and electric bike plug-ins are further features designed to appeal to the high-tech millennial demographic. At the same time, original terra-cotta tiles on the front facade are being restored.
"It's all about rejuvenating the original building carcass, while staying true to the spirit of the place," says Mr. Ouellette, who hopes to attract multiple tenants .
He's convinced that HootSuite might not have relocated to a former CSIS office in Fairview Slopes last year had the right facilities been available in Gastown.
Young high-tech firms are attracted to the same things that drew Century Group to the 100 Block Hastings Street.
"But with the character," he says, "they want their creature comforts, too."

Full text:   Gary Cohn, the No. 2 executive at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. , has just come from meetings with people overseeing hundreds upon hundreds of billions of dollars.
After arriving in Toronto this week for a Goldman-run conference, he had dinner with the chief executive officers of three of the country's largest pension funds and the head of RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust. He had breakfast with the incoming head of Royal Bank of Canada. In between, he met with two other bank CEOs and conferred with the head of the Ontario Securities Commission. Canada is a key market for Goldman, and he and the firm's Canadian head, Jack Curtin, wanted to see as many big clients and important contacts as possible.
Then Mr. Cohn took a break to sit down for a 45-minute interview to talk about the firm's challenges.
This is the new face of Goldman Sachs. Where once the company was a quietly elite group that shunned the press and avoided a public profile to concentrate on profits, the investment bank is now actively revealing itself to the world in an attempt to counter some of the blows absorbed in and after the financial crisis.
"Somehow we became synonymous with Wall Street. Whether it was deserved or not, I'm not going to argue with you," said Mr. Cohn, settled on a couch in Toronto's Shangri-La Hotel. "I obviously don't think we were, but it is what it is. I do believe we have made a lot of steps forward. We've been a lot more open, a lot more transparent."
The crisis was not kind to Goldman. With its stock plunging, Goldman was forced to turn itself into a bank in 2008 - accepting more regulation in return for a perception of stability. It was forced to take government aid, and it turned to billionaire Warren Buffett for a cash infusion that helped to restore confidence.
Still, the firm weathered the financial tempest much better than many competitors. Goldman was in the first group of major financial institutions to pay back the money it got from the government's Troubled Asset Relief Program. While other banks such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Bank of America have had huge litigation settlements over such issues as mortgages, Goldman's have been relatively minor.
However, the company's stock is only worth about 60 per cent of what it was at its peak before the 2008 financial crisis. And the company's reputation has taken an even bigger beating than its stock.
Goldman didn't do the one thing - handing out dodgy mortgages - that really got America in trouble, but it was involved in the daisy chain that turned those mortgages into investments that later went sour. The bottom came in 2009 when Rolling Stone polemicist Matt Taibbi famously dubbed the company a "vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity, relentlessly jamming its blood funnel into anything that smells like money."
Suddenly, what had been Goldman's strengths were now seen as weaknesses. The company's huge and heretofore steady profits and pay packages fed the public's perception of greed. Goldman's tendency to stay out of the press and concentrate on business was taken as a cloak of secrecy. The presence of Goldman alumni in key jobs ranging from U.S. Treasury Secretary (Hank Paulson) to Governor of the Bank of Canada (Mark Carney) was interpreted as evidence of a Goldman plot to control the levers of power.
As the crisis drew to a close, Goldman decided it had to approach business differently and dial back its aggressiveness, the edge that it once had.
"Not only should we look at can we do something, we look at should we do something," Mr. Cohn said. Before 2008, "what we didn't do as well is we didn't go through 'Just because we can do this transaction, should we do it?' Now we spend an equal amount of time on 'Should we?' "
Mr. Cohn said the company's new discretion has "put us into some very tough situations lately. We've withdrawn from some businesses and withdrawn from some opportunities out there in the world because we decided we shouldn't do that type of business because the brand and the reputation was too valuable."
What things did it reject? The firm doesn't like to talk about it. It does not want to be seen as disparaging potential clients who might one day want to do business with Goldman again.
One senior executive who has regularly hired Goldman to help with transactions says there's no doubt the firm has changed. Goldman is now more willing to put reputation before profit. The executive said that Goldman is not being purely altruistic - the firm just knows what works in today's market.
The new Goldman can even be funny. For many months recently, it has been lampooned by a Twitter account (@GSElevator) that purports to report things heard in elevators at Goldman offices. The anonymous tweeter was invariably unflattering in his portrayal of investment bankers' gilded lifestyle. (Here's a recent, tame example: "When life gives you lemons, order the lobster tail.")
In response, Goldman played the situation for a joke, helping to defuse the situation. When The New York Times revealed in February the identity of the person behind the Twitter account, the firm drolly commented that "we are pleased to report that the official ban on talking in elevators will be lifted effective immediately."
But funny does not make money. The new Goldman is unlikely to ever be as profitable as the old Goldman. Rather than minting the enormous returns that it regularly did before the financial crisis, its challenge now is simply to earn enough to justify the cost of doing business.
Balancing risk and returns
Goldman's businesses span trading of all sorts of assets, from bonds to stocks to currencies. The firm will advise on takeovers, arrange financings in stock and debt markets, and help companies hedge by structuring derivatives. Those businesses are all still in demand. In Canada, Goldman is a sought-after merger adviser. The company is adding to its Canadian operations to beef up its ability to trade local stocks.
However, Goldman cannot make as much money as it once did for the simple reason that it cannot take as much risk. Regulators have demanded that banks reduce the use of borrowed money, the key in "levering up" returns. They also demand that firms such as Goldman hold more cash on hand. That means keeping money in low-returning investments that can be turned quickly into cash.
The new rules make the system safer, but kill returns. Goldman's return on equity, a key measure of profitability for securities firms, is about a third of what it was at its peak. In 2006 and 2007, ROE topped 30 per cent. In the past two years, the key ratio has fallen just shy of 11 per cent. Given that many estimate the cost of equity for Goldman at about 10 per cent - the baseline level of returns that investors demand to own the stock - the returns Goldman is putting up are simply not high enough.
While the stock has been a solid performer in the past two years, analysts are cool on it. Of the 34 analysts polled by Bloomberg, only nine rate it a buy.
Mr. Cohn thinks that returns can and will be higher. He paints necessity as a virtue: "If you take the fact that we think we can get to higher returns than we have now in a much less risky business, it becomes a more valuable business over time."
To generate higher returns, Goldman will have to find ways out of a competitive squeeze. It's regulated as a bank, but it has no retail branch network. Thus, unlike rivals such as JPMorgan, it does not have huge reserves of deposits to draw on for funding. Goldman has to borrow money in more expensive money markets to fund its business.
In addition, Goldman has been pushed out of some lucrative trading and securities businesses by regulation. Those are now largely the province of unregulated asset managers.
Goldman must reshape its business to fit this new landscape. For example, the proprietary trading businesses for which Goldman was once well known are gone, shed in anticipation of regulatory crackdowns.
Mr. Cohn worries about the fact that much of the business that was once done by investment banks, and which got investors into trouble, is likely to appear again in the parts of the financial world that regulators don't touch - the so-called shadow banking system.
Goldman is no longer looking at building as many highly leveraged investment products. "We have reduced the lab where we used to have all these people creating and engineering these things."
But he expects risky products to pop up again, likely from the unregulated funds that Goldman competes with. He likens it to squeezing a balloon. As regulators apply pressure in one spot, the risk moves to where there is less pressure.
"If the past has any reference to the future, which it has for the past multiple hundred years in the financial services industry, you should bet that at some point in the future these products will all reappear. They will be called something else."
Commodity pit to president
Mr. Cohn's bespoke suit and loafers say banker, but his broad-shouldered, thick-chested physique is the kind of build that helps make a successful trader in the rough-and-tumble pits of the commodity business. He career spans both roles.
Born in 1960, he grew up in suburban Cleveland, the son of a real estate developer. He coped with dyslexia well enough to win admission to American University's business school in Washington, D.C. After graduating in 1982, he found himself back home.
In a commencement address at his old university in 2009, he said he lacked interviews and prospects. He was "having a great time," until one morning his father walked into his room at 6:30 a.m.
"I had been in bed for about an hour, I think, and [he] said, 'what are you going to do with the rest of your life.' I ironically told him, 'you're looking at it.' That did not go over very well in my house."
Job-hunting followed shortly thereafter. Mr. Cohn ended up at United States Steel, selling siding and window frames.
On a business trip to Long Island, he went to the commodities exchange in New York. After spending the day wondering how to land a job there, he saw a trader heading to the airport. He offered to share a cab, and on the way to La Guardia he talked his way into an interview the following Monday.
"I literally got home Friday night and my first stop on the way from the airport was the bookstore. I bought the McMillan Options as a Strategic Investment book and read it four times - as I said, dyslexic guy read it four times over the course of the weekend and came back in and interviewed and was offered a job. That's how I started in the financial services industry."
He began by trading silver. From the commodity pits, he was recruited by Goldman, where he has remained for the past 24 years. He rose through the commodities trading side of the business, and made partner in 1994, four years after joining. By 2003 he was head of the firm's global securities business.
Today, as president, chief operating officer and a member of Goldman's board, Mr. Cohn earned $12.5-million (U.S.) in 2012. He is one of the handful of internal candidates mentioned as possible successors to Goldman's CEO, Lloyd Blankfein. (Until recently, that group also included a Canadian, J. Michael Evans, but he has since left the firm.)
What Goldman will look like when Mr. Blankfein eventually passes control is not clear.
If regulation is holding back Goldman's returns, that problem is unlikely to be resolved any time soon. Mr. Cohn argues that it took 11 years for the last of the major securities laws to be put in place after the crash of 1929 - and the 2008 crisis was more complicated because it involved much more than just stocks. He knows there is likely much more rule-making to come.
"As far as we can understand where the regulatory world is going, we feel like we have done a good job of adapting to the new world. But we are also acutely aware that the environment in the regulatory world is always changing."
If the regulators and firms like Goldman have missed something, and the world faces another financial mess, Mr. Cohn is well aware that all the public relations in the world may not save the company from another drubbing.
"I feel like we're in a much better position now but I'm not naive. I understand that the world could change tomorrow and that if something goes wrong in the world and people want to write about Wall Street, they are still going to potentially pick on us."

Abstract: The corner of New York's 57th Street and 6th Avenue had seen better days. The Buckingham Hotel, as most short-term Manhattan accommodations do, once played host to many early-20th century luminaries, including Georgia O'Keeffe and pianist and Poland's first prime minister, Ignacy Jan Paderewski. Having faded in glamour of late, the property was bought and reopened as the Quin in late 2013.

Full text:   The corner of New York's 57th Street and 6th Avenue had seen better days. The Buckingham Hotel, as most short-term Manhattan accommodations do, once played host to many early-20th century luminaries, including Georgia O'Keeffe and pianist and Poland's first prime minister, Ignacy Jan Paderewski. Having faded in glamour of late, the property was bought and reopened as the Quin in late 2013. It would be easy to consider its address the most important asset, but the range of amenities and services make it hard to leave the hotel despite the environs.
Location, Location
You are in walking distance of Central Park, the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Opera, Carnegie Hall and all the shopping and landmarks on offer in Midtown. Once you've exhausted those cultural attractions, there are conveniently located subway stops on the corners of both 6th and 7th streets.
Design
Being on a block that includes the Viceroy and Le Parker Meredien, the Quin has taken its prime positioning amid luxury to heart. Suites are super-modern, but warm, including a mix of lacquered woods and sustainable materials for cabinetry throughout the space. Beds come from the Swedish manufacturer Duxiana, whose Dux collection includes technology that helps shape the mattress to individual sleepers. Climate, lighting and blinds are all controlled by a bedside tablet. The gadget even allows you to view a local weather report, as well as set privacy and room requests without having to get out of bed - a welcome proposition.
Best amenity
Guests who are seeking one-of-a-kind New York experiences can work with Luxury Attaché at the Quin. The high-end concierge is usually only on offer privately, but the Quin is one of a handful of hotels to offer the service. Picture this: Your son loves baseball, and we will forgive him for liking the Yankees. What about a meet and greet with Mariano Rivera and Derek Jeter? Or how about access to FAO Schwarz and its iconic keyboard floor for an hour before opening, or arranging private viewings of not-yet-released designer fashions at Bergdorf Goodman? If you can afford it, they will make it happen.
Eat in or eat out?
The in-house restaurant, the Wayfarer, was not yet open during my visit. However, it is now, and the floor-to-ceiling windows in the restaurant, coupled with that corner real estate, will make for great people-watching to go along with your meal. It's open for breakfast, lunch and dinner.
If I could change one thing
I wish there was a proper cocktail or coffee bar in the main lobby to better enjoy the hotel's 4.5-metre-high digital art wall, a jigsaw mosaic of LED screens that delicately looms over the room and displays a curated collection of multimedia work (it currently features the work of New York and San Francisco-based filmmaker-photographer Robert Christian Malmberg). Certainly worth sitting down to admire.
Room with a view
Ask for a corner suite high up, with a rare bird's eye view of 6th Avenue, one of New York's most famous boulevards. From that perch, you must take a moment to watch the non-stop parade of tiny taxis and petite pedestrians.
The Quin, 101 W. 57th St., New York; thequinhotel.com; 208 rooms starting at $349 (U.S.).

Full text:   Need a reason to navigate the terra incognita of this forgotten borough? We've got 13 - and they're all delicious. (Start with the lotus root salad, finish with a hazelnut Paris-Brest)
Walk east, away from the trendy confines of Williamsburg, and you enter a no-man's land of industry. There's no reason to be here in Ridgewood, Queens, on a Saturday afternoon in January. But then we spot the shack amid a bus depot and scrap metal yard: Bun-ker Vietnamese, the most buzzed about Vietnamese food in New York.
Feeling out of place is a familiar state when exploring Queens. The forgotten middle-child of New York's five boroughs sprawls across geography and ethnicities and you can be led far from what you recognize, in taste and place.
But with a little effort, this vast terra incognita rewards the curious diner. From chefs obsessed with dry-aging steak to classy seafood bars in Astoria - not to mention that Vietnamese street food from an Eleven Madison Park alumnus - a tour through the neighbourhoods of this densely populated county offers up New York's most eclectic dining away from the crowds of Manhattan and Brooklyn.
Ridgewood
Bun-ker Vietnamese is tiny, with a tiki-bar vibe. We slip in just before the noon lineup begins. Tables are crowded with food, locals and adventurous eaters. What distinguishes Bun-ker from your neighbourhood pho shop is quality ingredients. Chef Jimmy Tu has combined the sensibilities of haute Eleven Madison Park in Manhattan with the schooling he received trailing street vendors in Vietnam. Each bite is like a Russian doll of flavour: With grilled ribs, for example, you get the classic hit of thai basil, minty shiso and lemongrass. Any number of fresh seafood specials delight, and the standard coconut tapioca pudding is spiked with jackfruit and palm seeds for a sweet end.
* Bun-ker Vietnamese: 46-63 Metropolitan Ave., bunkervietnamese.com, 718-386-4282
Woodside
In Woodside, you'll find myriad options for Thai food that does not bow to the North American palate. You cannot go wrong at SriPraPhai, which deftly balances the spicy, sweet and acidic high-wire act of authentic cooking, or Ayada Thai. The latter, with lime green walls, gold statuary and subtitled Mexican soap operas, offers a panang curry that infuses the room with fragrant kaffir lime.
We pick chunks off a fried red snapper and dip them in the sweet sauce. The larb beef salad bites with hot chiles and soothes with basil and mint. If the spice won't relent, a thai iced tea will douse the fire.
* SriPraPhai: 64-13 39th Ave., sripraphairestaurant.com, 718-899-9599
* Ayada Thai: 78-03 Woodside Ave. (& 78th St.), ayadathaiwoodside.com, 718-424-0844
Flushing
At the end of the 7 line is New York's other Chinatown. Jets shear the buildings on approach to LaGuardia and the streets are tighter than Times Square. Often, North American Chinese is a bland whitewash of its varied regional cuisines. But here you can find spicy Sichuan at Lao Cheng Du (the sign says Prince Noodle House), Hunan at Hunan House or Xi'an at Biang!. The latter is reason enough to make the trip. Named for the sound the biang biang noodles make when being hand pulled and slapped, Biang! is a step up from the usual Chinatown spot, with a clean, long space, Edison bulbs and brisk but friendly service. Made in house by hand, those noodles are a chewy web unlike any other, slathered with chunks of spicy cumin-laced lamb. A starter of soft tofu dissolves in your mouth and a lotus root salad is a crisp hit of ginger. Go for the dumplings, too, which made Biang!'s name back when it was only a food truck. A meal with leftovers and beers lands under $40 (U.S.).
* Lao Cheng Du: 37-17 Prince St., 718-886-5595.
* Hunan House: 137-40 Northern Blvd., hunanhouseflushing.com, 718-353-1808.
* Biang!: 41-10 Main St., biang-nyc.com, 718-888-7713
Long Island City
A hop from Manhattan, this gentrifying 'hood attracts culinary entrepreneurs who see a future beyond Brooklyn and are attracted by the real estate opportunities. Dutch Kills hides behind a nondescript façade on a gritty stretch of industrial road. Part of the Milk and Honey cocktail empire that helped spark the cocktail renaissance in Manhattan and beyond, this bar offers the same Prohibition-era design and craft libations, but with Queens prices - such as the Don Lockwood (Bourbon, Islay Scotch, maple syrup and chocolate bitters) for $11. Grab a drink during happy hour when simple classics are $8 before heading to M. Wells Steakhouse.
* Dutch Kills: 27-24 Jackson Ave., Long Island City, dutchkillsbar.com, 718-383-2724
You're liable to miss the unsigned spot. It still looks like the car garage it once was except for the glimpse of the dining room through a porthole window. If anyone has made LIC a destination of late, it's Montreal chef Hugue Dufour and his wife, Sarah Obraitis. Between their nearby Dinette inside MoMA PS1 and the steakhouse, which opened to much anticipation last fall, they're teaching New Yorkers to worship meat anew. At M. Wells, the couple has reinterpreted the worn steakhouse concept by adding spectacle and upping the gluttony. If you sit at the chef's counter, be prepared to watch a blue trout get fished out of the tank, bludgeoned and gutted mere feet from you. The pork-chop tower teeters, the excessive caviar sandwich turns your blood briny (a delight, if that's your thing) and the French onion soup is amped up with a hunk of bone marrow. Of course you can also order steak, Flintstone-sized and wallet busting, but much of the creative fun is elsewhere on the menu. Plopped in the middle of the dining room, the dessert cart draws glances like a debutante. Get the hazelnut Paris-Brest.
* M. Wells Dinette at MoMA PSA: 22-25 Jackson Ave., magasinwells.com, 718-786-1800
* M. Wells Steakhouse: 43-15 Crescent St., magasinwells.com, 718-786-9060
Astoria
Head north from Long Island City and you hit Astoria. At end of the N/Q line you find an age-old Greek neighbourhood and MP Taverna is the best bet for creative Mediterranean flavours. Farther south are some hidden spots where Brooklyn expats congregate. The Strand Smokehouse is beer hall meets BBQ joint. It's huge and loud with live music and craft booze that washes down generous portions of meat. Mars, an unpretentious neighbourhood joint, marries oysters, cocktails and bistro fare. Cider fans should head to the Queens Kickshaw, which has one of the best cider lists in the city - and some killer grilled-cheese sandwiches. When we're seated at the Kickshaw's bar and get our pints and a band jams the blues, we feel the simple pleasure of arrival that only occurs after journeying into unfamiliar realms - and Queens, in the best sense, is many worlds away.

Full text:   Vivian Maier died unnoticed. Then John Maloof found her negatives and set out to illuminate her incredible street photography
'I am Vivian Maier."
John Maloof is joking, of course. Vivian Maier was a woman - picture Miss Hathaway crossed with Mary Poppins - and has been dead since April, 2009. He's a guy - if the Proclaimers were triplets, he'd be one of them - and very much alive.
Still, there's a certain truth to Maloof's declaration, made during an interview in Toronto. For if anyone can claim to have an intimate knowledge of Maier - to be obsessed by a woman who for four decades served as a nanny in Chicago, only to become, in the years after her death at 83, an internationally famous photographer - Maloof is the one. After all, it was this former real estate agent, amateur historian and flea-market habitué who, on one fateful fall day in 2007, paid $380 (U.S.) to a Chicago auctioneer for a box of 30,000 black-and-white negatives repossessed from a local storage locker.
Twenty-six at the time, Maloof didn't really know what he'd acquired; the hope was that somewhere in those negatives were pictures of Portage Park, an old neighbourhood in northwest Chicago about which Maloof was helping to write a history. As it turned out, the box contained nothing of that ilk, and a disappointed Maloof shoved the trove into a closet in his house.
Luckily, he didn't leave it there. Today, those 30,000 images are the cornerstone of a personal collection numbering more than 100,000 negatives and slides, 3,000-plus prints, several hundred rolls of film (currently in cold storage in Chicago), dozens of home movies, umpteen audiotapes, and much else, including clothes, hats and uncashed Social Security cheques. They all once belonged to Maier, who died, unmarried and childless, unnoticed and mostly unmourned, but who has since been recognized as one of the most significant street photographers of the 20th century.
"Had she made herself known, she would have been a famous photographer," says Mary Ellen Mark, herself, at 74, an acclaimed photographer often referenced in discussions about Maier. But because the secretive, mysterious Maier did not, the task has been taken on by Maloof. And so far, it's been so good - even if, as Maloof confesses, there have been times when he hasn't "done a very good job of preserving my sanity."
For Maloof - who had no background in photography before coming upon the Maier photographs, and who took a crash course in the subject only after being inspired by her work - the past four years have seen a spate of Maloof-orchestrated Maier exhibitions and books, news stories and TV features, magazine articles, public slide shows, online forums and, yes, commercial sales. All of that has unfolded against a backdrop of Maloof's developing, scanning and archiving Maier's prodigious output.
Now, in another stunning career pivot on the part of Maloof, comes a feature-length movie, Finding Vivian Maier, which he co-wrote, co-produced, co-directed, mostly shot and, in effect, co-stars in. After a world premiere at last year's Toronto International Film Festival, it is having its theatrical release this month and next in selected U.S. and Canadian centres.
Maloof began work on the documentary in 2010, eliciting crowd-funding from Kickstarter for pre-production costs, including research and the filming of interviews with Maier acquaintances. Along the way, the project caught the attention of another Chicagoan, Jeff Garlin, a man best known as an actor ( Curb Your Enthusiasm , Mad About You ) and producer but who is also a photography collector.
Sensing that Maloof might need a hands-on collaborator for his big-screen project, Garlin placed a call to his friend Michael Moore for advice. It was Moore who recommended Charlie Siskel - another Chicagoan, albeit one transplanted to California - who had worked as a producer on the Oscar-winning Bowling for Columbine . "We spoke the same language right from the very beginning," Siskel says of Maloof. By year's end, Siskel was Finding Vivian Maier 's co-writer, co-director and co-producer.
In larger part, the film is a detective story, documenting as it does Maloof's and Siskel's meetings with genealogists and with Maier's former employers and charges - she worked with many families, but also travelled the world - and their rummaging through files and records. Their goal: to figure out who this Vivian Maier was, and to quote Siskel, why she lived "this double life, masquerading as the nanny, the help, to make room for this other part of her life as a photographer." Then there's Maloof meeting with Mark and fellow street photographer Joel Meyerowitz, straining to fathom the depths of Maier's genius as they scan her wares.
In all, Siskel and Maloof met 90 individuals who had some association with Maier, and interviewed half of them. And while the film does shed considerable, sometimes unsettling light on Maier's history, the two men are the first to admit it doesn't "expose every corner" of the photographer's life; nor was it their intention to do so. "We just wanted to tell a compelling story," Siskel observes.
Maloof, meanwhile, stands to become, if not rich, then comfortable on Maier - if he hasn't done so already. It is estimated his Maier collection includes about 80 per cent of her known output. Yet Maloof insists his intentions are honourable and remain unchanged from the moment he was first charmed by what she'd captured with her Rolleiflex twin-lens reflex - namely, "to put Vivian in the history books."
That seems pretty much assured. Institutionally, however, it's been another story. While Maloof has enlisted prominent New York photography gallerist Howard Greenberg as the sole seller of Maier originals, those prints have yet to enter the collections of major art institutions. In large part, that's one more result of Maier's obsessively secretive life - and posthumous fame: Institutions want photographs printed by artists themselves, or at least printed and edited for exhibition at the artist's direction. Maier did none of those things during her lifetime; nor did she leave instructions about how her work should be handled after her death. But the people haven't sweated that canonization. They've already given their benediction.
Finding Vivian Maier opens in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal on March 28. It plays in Victoria, Edmonton, Regina and Winnipeg for limited runs in April. Check local listings.

CORRECTION: A Saturday Arts article on Vivian Maier said she did not print her own photographs. In fact she did, although they were not exhibition quality.

Full text:   RETAILING REPORTER
Lululemon Athletica Inc. is paving the way for an accelerated international expansion as its new leader looks to pump up the business and patch up its merchandise and image problems.
Laurent Potdevin, who took over as chief executive officer on Jan. 20, said he would hire local experts, rather than long-time Lululemon staff, as he takes the yoga-wear retailer into Europe and Asia, in a bid to move more quickly amid slowing North American sales gains.
"It's a pretty big shift from our prior strategy, when we sent people who were very well versed in the Lululemon culture," Mr. Potdevin said in an interview on Thursday. "The shift in mindset that we're executing now is to really build, mostly in Asia and Europe, very deep, relevant market expertise" with local players.
Lululemon has been slowly expanding into new markets over the past five years, first by setting up temporary stores - called showrooms - to test markets, taking its time to hire staff and find the right real estate for permanent stores. Now, Mr. Laurent is signalling he wants to put his foot on the gas pedal as traffic decelerates at its core North American outlets and sales gains slide.
Investors seemed pleased with the new direction, pushing the stock up 6.2 per cent to $51.20 (U.S.), its best gain in 11 months. Although the retailer's outlook for next year is lower than analysts expected, it beat its reduced forecast for the fourth quarter of 2013.
"Commentary from [Mr. Potdevin] regarding the Lululemon brand and its prospects for growth are being well received by the market," said Howard Tubin, a retail analyst at RBC Capital Markets. The new leader had a "solid showing," added John Morris, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets.
As the company prepares to open its first London flagship next week, it continues to grapple with several high-profile stumbles. A year ago, it took a big hit when it had to pull its signature black women's yoga pants because they were too see-through. Its founder Chip Wilson offended some customers by suggesting they may be too big to wear the chain's clothing. He resigned, although he is still on the board of directors; CEO Christine Day also stepped down.
Mr. Potdevin said the company has learned lessons from it experiences and is moving forward "with confidence and humility." On the international front, he is applying lessons he learned as president of TOMS Shoes and, before that, at snowboard specialist Burton. He said he plans to extend Lululemon's key products to new regions, but develop about 10 to 20 per cent of the merchandise specifically for local areas.
As well, he sees the need to expand beyond Lululemon's core products to seasonal and different styles. He said when he was with Burton in the early years of snowboarding, it produced mainly black pants and black bindings, but as the brand evolved, it moved into more colourful styles.
"When a global iconic brand has a staple product, it needs to evolve to more seasonal offerings to re-engage that customer more often," he said. Lululemon is now at that "inflection point."
And global retailers have to become more flexible when it comes to looking for store locations in new regions abroad, Mr. Potdevin said.
In Hong Kong, for example, where rents are extremely high, Lululemon has operated small showrooms for about five years but hasn't found suitable space for a permanent store. Lululemon may have to adjust its plans to local situations in order to speed up growth, Mr. Potdevin said. "Hong Kong is not going to adapt to Lululemon," he said. "Lululemon is going to adapt to Hong Kong."
The retailer reported its fourth-quarter profit stayed relatively flat at $109.7-million or 75 cents a diluted share, compared with $109.4-million or 75 cents a share a year earlier. Revenue increased 7 per cent to $521-million, while same-store sales fell 2 per cent but rose 4 per cent when combined with e-commerce; the company expects those sales at outlets open a year or more - a key retail measure - to, combined, pick up "in the low to mid-single digits" in 2014.

LISTING AGENT
Kate Carcone, Re/Max Hallmark York Group Realty Ltd.
The Action: On a street south of Toronto East General Hospital, this Arts and Crafts residence was strategically priced at $500,000 based on the fact that neighbouring homes sold for $40,000 more than that in February. It netted nearly 100 showings and commanded $125,000 over the asking price in a bidding war between 15 visitors.
What They Got: Built in 1927, this semi-detached house was maintained by the same owner since 1955 and boasted much of its original period charm, including strip hardwood floors on both levels, carefully preserved under a layer of broadloom.
* The 1,800-square-foot layout is still traditional with separate living, dining and cooking spaces, plus a formal foyer with leaded glass accent windows, wainscotting and grand staircase to three bedrooms and a four-piece bathroom upstairs.
* For storage, there is an unfinished basement and a detached garage off a mutual driveway on the 23-by-103-foot lot.
The Agent's Take: "Many young buyers are looking for property with old charm and restorable architectural features," says agent Kate Carcone. "This property blended the right mix of period charm, spacious principal rooms and a central location walking distance to schools, parks, local transit and all amenities."
The home's size and solid state were also crucial. "Other [homes] were selling for $530,000 to $540,000, but ours was two feet wider, which in Toronto makes a difference," adds Ms. Carcone. "[And] perhaps the most notable asset - was the well maintained mechanics of the house."

Full text:   Red brick structure built in 1853 has the feel and look of an old farmhouse, but new floor-to-ceiling windows bring in the light
THE LISTING
Asking price: $1.49-million
Taxes: $6,353.92 (2013)
Lot size: 60 by 149.7 feet
Agents: Colin Kinnear and Cynthia Goodchild (Royal LePage Real Estate Services Ltd., Johnston and Daniel Division)
The back story
This red brick house sat on 400 acres of farmland edging down to the Humber River when it was built in the Gothic Revival style in 1853. The surrounding village was known as Lambton Mills for the grist and saw mills that operated along the river at that time.
In the early 1900s, a new owner named John Berry moved into the three-bedroom house. Mr. Berry was the treasurer and tax collector for the Township of Etobicoke, and the local residents would come to the house to pay their taxes, says the current owner, Jill Kelsall.
The house is still known as the Berry House as - over the years - the surrounding land was gradually developed and Lambton Mills was absorbed into the neighbourhood now known as the Kingsway.
During its 161 years, the house built before Confederation has been home to only six families.
The house today
Ms. Kelsall had the opportunity to chat with the previous owner when she bought the house at 125 Kingsway Cres. many years ago. That owner, architect Blake Miller, had also designed the large addition on the rear of the house.
Ms. Kelsall says Mr. Miller was known for his modern design in the 1970s, but he also appreciated the historic house.
The addition added a light-filled dining area and a large kitchen with a walk-out to a large terrace.
"He was a modern man with a real love for old buildings. It was a lovely challenge for him to take this old farmhouse and give it a new life," she said.
On the lower level, the addition created an extra living area with above-ground windows. The bedroom, sitting room, bathroom and small kitchen can also serve as a separate suite for a nanny or older children, points out real estate agent Colin Kinnear.
When Ms. Kelsall took over, she removed an enclosed porch that had been added over the years. She had help from her father-in-law, the interior designer Murray Oliver, who was involved in the restoration of the Old Mill Inn in Toronto and Dundurn Castle in Hamilton, Ont.
They found a vintage photo of the house with its original porch and Mr. Oliver ensured that new porch posts were milled to replicate the original design. Inside, Ms. Kelsall had a window that had been closed off opened up again in the living room.
At some point the ceilings had been dropped so she had them restored to their original height of 10 feet.
"It was so odd to me that they had it all closed off," Ms. Kelsall said. "We really wanted to see the light."
The front door, mouldings and windows throughout the house were also replaced or repaired in keeping with the original style. The centre staircase with original balustered railing and spindles remains.
"We tried to be respectful of the modern architecture but keep a farmhouse feel," says Ms. Kelsall, who sought out antique sconces and mirrors and other fixtures of the period.
The family room has been converted from two rooms into one large space with a fireplace on a raised hearth.
Ms. Kelsall, who lives with sons Matthew, David and Joshua Oliver, says she enjoys the fact that the principal rooms are large and accommodating and the bedrooms are relatively small.
That encourages family members to spend time together in the main part of the house, she says.
"It has humble bedrooms and I like it from that point of view."
Ms. Kelsall says one of the things she enjoys most is seeing the blossoms emerge on the apple tree in the large backyard. Large mature trees also provide shade, and the parkland along the river provides a favourite walk.
"We are 25 steps from the Humber River. It's a beautiful, beautiful place to live."
A single garage at the rear of the property has been converted to a studio.
In the fall, Ms. Kelsall pulls out a vintage press and invites the neighbours over to squeeze the apples for their juice.
"They get mad at me if I forget to bring it out," she says.
Ms. Kelsall says 125 Kingsway Cres. has become such a local landmark, she had the house designated as a historic property under heritage conservation rules.
The best feature
Ms. Kelsall says the modern addition - with a vaulted, skylit ceiling and floor-to-ceiling glass - is a dramatic setting for formal dining. For really large gatherings, she sets up tables that extend into the living room.
"We've had dinner for 22 in this room."
She adds that the east-facing expanse of glass brings the light into the kitchen and dining area at the start of the day.
"It's so amazing. In the morning we get to see the sun come up and it's a beautiful sunrise from there."
The glass door leading to the outdoor terrace makes it easy for guests to move from the living room, through the dining room and into the back garden.
"It's a very gracious place for friends. We've had really great parties here."
Revision date: Thursday, April 03, 2014
CORRECTION: In the Home of the Week story in Friday's Globe Real Estate, the home incorrectly was said to have been "designated" under heritage conservation rules. In fact, the home has been listed, but not designated. The City of Toronto makes this distinction to differentiate between properties about which City Council has adopted a recommendation to be included on its inventory of heritage properties and those that have been individually designated under Part IV of the Ontario Heritage Act.

Full text:   Canada Pension Plan Investment Board is turning its powerful sights on residential real estate investments in Asia, embracing a new investment category as analysts warn of an emerging bubble in the Chinese housing sector.
CPPIB, which invests $201.5-billion of assets on behalf of the Canada Pension Plan, said Tuesday it has launched a venture to invest $250-million (U.S.) in China's red-hot residential real estate market through a partnership with China's largest - and most colourful - developer.
The deal is the second for CPPIB in residential real estate, coming just a month after it took its first toehold in India's highly fragmented residential sector with a partnership to provide debt financing to Indian developers.
The pension fund has amassed a global portfolio of shopping malls and office towers, including $4.2-billion worth of real estate holdings in Asia alone.
But Graeme Eadie, senior vice-president of real estate at CPPIB, said the fund had previously avoided the residential real estate sector, which is typically highly mature and fragmented among small developers.
"We wouldn't typically do residential development in the more developed countries, but the depth of demand in the emerging markets is just so high that we think there's a long-term business there," Mr. Eadie said Tuesday.
Mr. Eadie said the partnership with China Vanke Co. Ltd. is critical to CPPIB because the firm has the local knowledge to navigate the overheated residential market in many Chinese cities. "If they don't like the market, they'll probably see issues long before we're going to."
Residential prices in cities such as Beijing and Shanghai have soared in recent years - climbing more than 20 per cent in Beijing last year alone, according to the China Index Academy - and many experts are warning the bubble could burst and prices could drop.
Patrick Chovanec, chief strategist at Silvercrest Asset Management Group in New York and a former business professor in Beijing, said he is not positive about the prospects of residential real estate as an investment in China because prices have swelled as Chinese people have made real estate their primary investment purchases.
The result has been a huge escalation of housing prices while thousands of investment units sit vacant in major cities across the country.
"To say there's lots of demand for housing in China doesn't mean any valuation makes sense," Mr. Chovanec said. "And what has happened is the valuations have been propelled skyward by this desire to put money somewhere."
But Mr. Chovanec said CPPIB has also partnered with one of China's top-tier developers, and there is huge demand for housing in the country, so Vanke could prove to be a survivor even if the market does weaken sharply.
"There will be winners and losers, and some of the winners will be those that have strong cash positions ... or they bought at a lower price point."
Mr. Eadie said CPPIB's initial investment of $250-million will not all be committed immediately to projects, so it is possible the venture could move slowly if problems materialize in the housing market. He said CPPIB could also invest more in the partnership depending on the initial success of the venture.
"We typically look to find the really good partners in a market and then we build with them; so, assuming we continue to see the right opportunities and we like where the market is, we would certainly like to grow with them," he said.
Mr. Eadie said the partners do not intend to develop luxury housing stock, which has become the most inflated tier of the Chinese market in top cities such as Shanghai. "There is still good strength in the middle-income type product and that's really where this venture is focusing."
Vanke is China's biggest residential developer with revenue of $22-billion annually. The company was founded in 1984 by entrepreneur Wang Shi, an English-speaking climbing enthusiast who has scaled Mount Everest several times and has reportedly trekked to both the north and south poles. He has also made headlines in China for dating much-younger actress Tian Pujun.
The Chinese company will invest equally in the joint venture with CPPIB and will be responsible for sourcing the projects. To get started, the two partners said they are investing in a project in Qingdao, which is a sprawling port city of nine million people.
While CPPIB has taken a toehold in the residential sectors in India and China, Mr. Eadie said the fund is not anticipating further deals in other Asian countries because the markets are smaller and it is hard to find ways to invest meaningful sums in their residential sectors.

Farmland protection isn't always a benefit to farmers

Abstract: Ms. Street is a second-generation farmer, and she and her husband expected to hand over the ranch to their sons when they retired. "It is a great life, it's a wonderful way to raise children," she said. "We'd [work] for 14, 16 hours a day up in the mountains in the summertime ... Then you'd come in at night and eat quality food."

Faye Street ran cattle in the Kootenays for three decades, a lifestyle that allowed her to put fresh, homegrown food on the table. "My kids never ate store-bought bread. I made my own butter," she says with undisguised pride.
Ms. Street is a second-generation farmer, and she and her husband expected to hand over the ranch to their sons when they retired. "It is a great life, it's a wonderful way to raise children," she said. "We'd [work] for 14, 16 hours a day up in the mountains in the summertime ... Then you'd come in at night and eat quality food."
But her boys would have none of it. "They both just looked at us and said, 'Are you crazy? You work like dogs and never make any money.'"
All around the valley, Ms. Street has watched farmers and ranchers give up the fight. She says the province needs to help sustain agriculture - not by protecting every inch of farmland, but by allowing producers more flexibility to make a living.
She hopes that Bill Bennett, the minister responsible for a "core review" of government operations, will do what no minister has dared do in 40-odd years: Wrangle the sacred cow that is the province's Agricultural Land Reserve.
Mr. Bennett could introduce legislation as early as this week to change the ALR and its governing body.
Late last year, a leaked document suggested Mr. Bennett was preparing major changes to the management of protected farmland in B.C. It touched off a political furor. At that time, Mr. Bennett insisted he has no plans to take over the independent agency that has managed 4.7 million hectares of agricultural land in B.C. since the reserve was established in 1972.
But in a recent interview, he was clear he's ready to make changes to the mandate of the Agricultural Land Commission.
In Mr. Bennett's mind, there are two distinct farming regions in B.C. There are the rich lands of the Fraser Valley and around Metro Vancouver, where there is constant pressure from encroaching real estate development.
That still appears to be untouchable, in his mind. But then there is the rest of the province, to the north and east of the District of Hope.
"When the reserve was created, the further away from the Fraser Valley and the Lower Mainland the government got, the less care, attention and resources went into drawing those boundaries," Mr. Bennett said.
"The starting point for people who live beyond Hope, in rural British Columbia, is that there is a bunch of land in there that never should have been there in the first place. What's wrong with having a look at that?"
The ALC is looking at those boundaries, however. Over the past two years it has reviewed boundaries that define protected farmland around the province. For example last month, in the Elk Valley, it excluded 1,400 hectares of land from the ALR, and swapped it with 700 hectares of new, more productive farmland to be protected.
Lana Popham, the NDP MLA for Saanich South, said the problem does not lie within the commission, but in the government's failure to support farmers. The agriculture budget was cut by 25 per cent in 2009 - just as consumers were starting to catch on to the local food movement.
"There is no strategic plan to take advantage of this opportunity," she said. She expects Mr. Bennett will strip the commission of its real powers, leaving it just a shell so that the government can get on with its economic development plans unfettered by independent oversight.
"I can guarantee, the changes will not support farmers," she said.
Ms. Street sees no inconsistency with being both a defender of farmland, and an opponent of the present system.
The commission has a mandate to protect the land in the reserve, a model that she describes as useless. The commission needs to preserve not just the land, but the farmers too.
"Our food-producing land should be sacred to everyone," she said. "We have lost half the food producers here in the Kootenay Valley.
"People need to wake up. You have to take care of the farmers, and they will take care of the land."

Full text:   First, it was Canada's housing sector. Now, it's the country's commercial real estate market.
Pundits around the world are still immersed in a vigorous debate about just how overheated the residential real estate market here is, and whether it's destined for a crash. Now some are also training their sights on Canada's commercial real estate market - the wide array of office towers, shopping malls, and factories that have become hot commodities in recent years.
The key players in this sector - including Canadian pension funds, real estate investment trusts and insurers - have been saying for at least a year that the market, which has always been cyclical, appears to be near its peak.
But questions are being raised about whether they've done enough to prepare for a potential softening.
Richard Johnson, a Zurich-based managing director of UBS Global Asset Management, held a meeting with pension funds in Toronto last month and told them that UBS is concerned about their level of exposure to Canadian real estate.
"With most Canadian institutional real estate investment focused on domestic real estate, pension funds could be seriously overexposed in the event of a downdraft in the market," he says.
Canadian commercial real estate boasts a 10-year annualized total return of 11.9 per cent, according to Investment Property Databank Ltd. That's the highest of all countries covered by IPD, except for South Africa.
The 11.9-per-cent commercial real estate figure compares with a return of about 8 per cent on equities and 5.6 per cent on bonds.
A number of factors have driven Canada's commercial real estate market to outperform expectations over the past five years.
Local landlords, such as pension funds and REITs, have had a lot of capital to invest, leading to stiff competition for prized assets. And Canada's status as a safe haven in the wake of the financial crisis caused foreign players to look for places to park their money here.
UBS expects the total return on Canadian commercial real estate in the next three years or so will be in the neighbourhood of 6 per cent.
But William Hughes, head of UBS's global asset management real estate research and strategy group, says that the market's performance will be impacted more by perception than any fundamental changes. And he says that if investors decide they're ready to take on more risk to seek higher returns, then some of those who were attracted to Canada by its safe-haven status could look to invest their money elsewhere, hurting real estate values here.
"Pricing is a concern," says Leo de Bever, the CEO of the Alberta Investment Management Corp., or AIMCo.
"Real estate has been the best-performing asset class since 2000. I'm not sure that will be the case going forward. That said, all asset classes are fully priced, or in the case of bonds, riskier than they have been since the 1950-1980 period."
Most of the major pension funds have been diversifying their portfolios, and increasingly looking for investment opportunities abroad. A number of pension funds and other institutional players are also shifting toward building new office towers and other commercial real estate developments in Canada, rather than paying top prices for existing ones.
"The development cycle is working well right now for sure, a lot of us are finding it easier to manufacture profits than to buy them," says Blake Hutcheson, CEO of Oxford Properties, the real estate arm of the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System (OMERS).
But he adds that he believes supply and demand are in check, and "I don't think in any way Canada is overpriced. The real estate fundamentals in Canada have remained as strong as any in the world."
There is some concern that too many new office towers are being developed. More than 15 million square feet of new office space is scheduled to be built across Canada in the next four years, with the country in the midst of the most active downtown development cycle in 20 years, according to brokerage Cushman & Wakefield.
But Cushman CEO Scott Chandler noted that the pension funds are developing much of the new supply - and the new towers are likely to do well, at the expense of the older ones.
Similarly, market players note that in a softening market the best assets will still hold their value, and many of those - such as landmark shopping malls - are owned by the pension funds.
Amy Erixon, a managing director in Avison Young's investments business, said that pension funds in Canada tend to have a large allocation to real estate as a means of diversifying, in part because the stock market is so concentrated.
Lorenz Reibling, chairman of Boston-based Taurus Investment Holdings, says that the real estate investment firm has sold more than $150-million in Canadian real estate lately, including shopping centres and office space.
"The best time to sell is when everyone else wants to buy, so that's what we have done," he says.
Taurus still owns some shopping centres in Canada, and Mr. Reibling says it's looking for more Canadian assets to buy. But they will be "riskier" assets - that is, fixer-uppers - because the rest, he says, are fully priced.

Full text:   Matt Gilgan has maintained the heritage elements of an 1870 cottage, while preparing it for an energy-efficient reawakening
daveleblanc@globeandmail.com
When Matt Gilgan says he's a "fish swimming upstream," he's referring to having a super-green, passive-solar, straw-bale home built among the traditional Tudors of Oakville. But he may as well be talking about his experiences with the family business.
Mr. Gilgan is the eldest son of billionaire home builder Peter Gilgan - according to Forbes magazine, Peter Gilgan is the 27th richest man in Canada - who started Mattamy Homes in 1978. In fact, "Mattamy" is a blend of "Matthew" and "Amy," the two oldest of Mr. Gilgan's eight children.
But, after starting out as a general summer labourer at the age of 15 - something the younger Mr. Gilgan says he very much enjoyed - and moving up the ladder to hold positions as varied as site supervisor, sales and marketing director, head of land acquisitions for a new Arizona arm of the company, and "this very strange, made-up position called director of strategic improvement," the gregarious, artistically-inclined 37-year-old developed a distaste for corporate culture.
"I came to decide that my values are different than the company," he says, without a trace of malice.
So, six years ago, Mr. Gilgan left Mattamy. Shortly after that, he purchased an 1870 stucco-clad worker's cottage on Oakville's Chisholm Street, a designated heritage building associated with a tannery that was once the town's largest employer.
While maintaining the heritage elements, Mr. Gilgan set out to explore cutting-edge sustainable ideas he wasn't able to pursue during his time with Mattamy: "I wanted to see all these things I'd heard about and read about and evaluate them for myself," he says.
After finding Milton-based architect Tom Kolbasenko of Our Cool Blue, Mr. Gilgan set to work on "deconstructing" the non-heritage elements of the house to prepare it for its green reawakening. Unfortunately, the old foundation proved to be so poor, extra time and money was spent re-supporting the home on steel beams, which he sarcastically calls "a minor setback." New parts of the home would have walls made of straw bale sealed with earthen plaster, which, he says, most people associate with hobbit-like structures in the country (a myth he wants to disprove), so Camel's Back Construction near Peterborough was brought on board as well. The home would have a large passive-solar element, a geothermal system, radiant floors and plenty of recycled material.
Three years in the making and pretty much complete now, the home has all of those things, plus much more. In addition to recycled wood, some parts of the concrete floors are clad with a half-inch of local clay mixed with straw bits and sand that came from a big hole at a construction site. While it took three weeks to air-dry, Mr. Gilgan says it's "quite durable" and "very repairable."
The massive soapstone fireplace, he says, was a joy to watch go together. Plates of stone were "stacked to make this weaving, three-dimensional maze" that directs heat on a long journey before delivering it to the chimney; this, he explains, traps most of the heat within the stone (to radiate for hours and warm the house) rather than wasting it. "Fireplaces are getting a bad rap in some circles," he adds. "Usually, they're wide open and you're not capturing much of the heat - but this, it burns very efficiently and we've been using it on the cold, cold days and it's amazing."
It's so amazing the home doesn't need a conventional furnace. In addition, free solar energy is captured in the stone-clad walls of the tall, south-facing solarium. Standing on the home's second floor floating bridge, Mr. Gilgan points to a series of air intakes that can, if needed, direct that free heat via fans to the middle of the home or, if that's too warm, all the way down to the basement, or, in summer, eject it outside. Beneath the solarium underground is a large cistern that collects rainwater.
And speaking of rainwater, Mr. Gilgan says the town of Oakville rained on his green parade, a little: Despite many parts of Europe allowing rainwater to be a home's sole source of water, even potable, Oakville was "basically lumping in rainwater with grey water, which it's not." With a preference for the low-tech side of things, he complains also that he was "forced into more mechanization and more mechanized backups [by the town] than we would have liked." In future, he hopes to deliver documentation to get some bylaws changed.
As for green roof technology, which he's incorporated into a few small areas, he's unsure: "Aesthetically, it's beautiful but there are a lot of layers of membrane and there [is] always the concern of technical failure."
Thankfully, there are touches of whimsy to counter all the gee-whiz technology. His stairwell wall is a three-dimensional work of art - bits of lath, chain, barn board, copper pipe and old grills all jumble together - that came about because he'd been itching to use all the bits he'd been collecting over the years (some salvaged from dad's construction sites, some from this house). There is an earthen plaster sink upstairs that was built on-site and sealed by a Moroccan process known as "tadelakt." An old claw-foot tub has been repurposed as a dog-washing station in the basement. And, finally, there is a "truth window" in the master bathroom upstairs (most straw bale homes leave one small square of wall open to show the bales behind the plaster). Equal parts serious sustainable experiment, rustic cottage, and modern family space, Mr. Gilgan is putting the home on the market in the next few weeks. His next adventure, he says, is to try and enroll his two children into Bali's The Green School while he and his wife learn even more about sustainable practices.
At a cool $4.5-million, however, it remains to be seen if denizens of Oakville are ready. "I've been very encouraged by the way people react in here," he finishes. "I think they feel a kind of authenticity to it."

Full text:   It's an encouraging trend that sees architects abandoning the monotonous glass box for something that articulates individuality
jmays@globeandmail.com
As every observer of Toronto's real estate scene knows, hardly a month goes by without the launch of sales for yet another mid-rise condominium block on one of the city's important thoroughfares.
According to the wisdom now prevailing at city hall - wisdom that generally makes sense to me - this is an instance of the world's unfolding as it should. Mid-sized residential structures are to punch up at various spots alongside the avenues, interrupting forever Hogtown's familiar main-street rhythm of two- and three-storey mixed-use brick buildings.
We will lose valuable things in this process of necessary intensification - certain commercial streetscapes fashioned by our bewhiskered Victorian ancestors, for example, and, in some places, historic patterns of organizing urban space and time.
But if I am reading the signs of the times rightly, the city also stands to gain something from the addition of mid-rise density on the avenues. It's a fresh layer of modestly scaled residential fabric with sound contemporary styling and even expressive flair, and freedom from historical pastiche.
The signs I am talking about are renderings and models of architecturally interesting mid-sized condo projects that have premiered in the last few months.
One is Quadrangle Architects' Duke, slated to go up on Dundas Street West, in the Junction area. Another is SQ, a design by Teeple Architects intended for a site near Queen Street just west of Spadina Avenue. (Both of these have been featured here in previous columns.)
The third and most recent is the nine-storey Nest, crafted by RAW Design for the Rockport Group, and scheduled to displace a church, a café and a KFC outlet on St. Clair Avenue West, halfway between Bathurst and Dufferin streets.
In their treatments of overall form, the authors of all three schemes have abandoned, to one degree or another, the precedent of the monotonous, standard-issue box and created, instead, irregular stacks of sharply delineated volumes that dodge back and forth from the vertical plane, or slip sideways out of the grid.
The architects are attempting to transcend the anonymous look of the more usual apartment block by breaking down the building mass into clearly articulated dwellings. And this sculptural expression of each apartment visibly declares, rather than conceals, the true nature of the residential mid-rise as a vertical neighbourhood inhabited by individuals, couples and small families with unique identities.
With Duke, SQ, Nest and similar structures, we may be seeing the start of a promising design trend in Toronto's multifamily housing market.
I hope so, and I hope it continues.
Nest will comprise 122 units, most of them ranging in size from a junior one-bedroom (about 450 square feet) to a two-bedroom-plus-den at just over 1,000 square feet. The smallest suite is on the market for around $239,000, while most apartments are expected to sell for between $350,000 and the low $600,000s. A penthouse is available for $760,000.
In a considerate bow to local business owners, who have complained about the shortage of parking since the coming of the St. Clair rapid transit line, the developer will provide 44 public spaces for cars.
The design of Nest is more staid than that of either Duke or SQ, but it shares novel geometry with them.
Nest's façade rises from the sidewalk in two broad movements. Closer to the ground, the face abutting St. Clair is composed of oblongs strongly outlined by muscular concrete frames finished in what appear to be three shades of grey: very light, medium, charcoal.
This visual definition of each living unit is one thing that makes Nest different from a routine chunk of modernist housing, and it encourages the owners to think of their apartments as homes, places with addresses (and exterior appearances) all their own.
Closer to the top, the tight, brick-like stacking of rectangular elements lower down loosens up, and the façade becomes glassier, lighter, more transparent. The grey-framed oblongs thin out up there, but the ones that remain thrust forward boldly from the building.
As was ever thus with structures taller than about three storeys, the lion's share of the drama in this project happens on its uppermost levels. But the bottom, which will be assigned to retail, is entirely devoid of architectural interest. It would be good if RAW found a way to bring some of the building's higher-up animation down to the sidewalk.
On the whole, however - and if it lives up to its renderings - Nest promises to be a worthwhile contribution to Toronto's next generation of mid-rise, main-street dwellings, and a good example for architects trying out new design ideas in this city's residential marketplace.

Abstract: Enthusiasts should frequent vintage-furniture fairs and storefront dealers. "Build a rapport," [Petra Curtis] says. " You won't get the same ground knowledge from a sales assistant." Crucially, well-known dealers get right of first refusal when locals sell off their contents.

Full text:   A 1949 armchair recently sold for $780,000. Here are five rules for shopping for (the suddenly hot) mid-century chair
When a 1949 Chieftain armchair by Danish designer Finn Juhl sold last fall for $780,000 at auction, mid-century furniture dealers yawned. Mid-century modern, a functional, clean-lined movement in furniture spanning the two decades after the Second World War, has rocketed in value over the past 10 years - in line with top salaries, real estate and design savvy. Chairs, the items for which many mid-century designers flexed their most creative muscle, are the "iconic" items of the era. And they've become apt market barometers.
As demand grows from middle America to the Middle East, stock is disappearing, and dealers who might have charged $1,000 10 years ago for a Soft-Pad chair by Charles and Ray Eames today charge twice that. Greg James, a buyer for the Fabulous Find in Victoria, reckons prices have risen "30 per cent across the board over the past five years." Less ubiquitous chairs from voguish names such as Poul Kjaerholm have appreciated even more. "A decade ago, I'd sell Kjaerholm's PK22 chairs for £700 [$1,293]. Now it's more like £2,500 [$4,617]," says Rob McClymont of the Modern Warehouse in London. "What used to be 'second-hand' is now 'modern antique.'"
Fans of the look see it as functional art. "When you buy original mid-century modern, your money is not gone," says Lawrence Blairs, owner of Atomic Design in Toronto. "It's merely locked away." If you want to get in on the ground floor, follow the rules of the pros.
Decide what you want
"Always buy what you like and not what you think will be a good investment," says Petra Curtis, co-founder of the Midcentury Modern Marketplace directory. "You have to connect with the piece in some way," says Blairs. "Maybe it reminds you of your grandparents' house or the colours in a painting." If it's Eames, you'll be in the majority, but you'll also need to keep on the lookout for knock-offs, which have led to prices levelling off.
"Teak chairs can't be copied officially," says James, meaning their value will hold. James recommends lesser-known designers, such as Peter Hvidt. "Everything he did was solid teak and finger jointed - awesome stuff."
Vintage, reissue or knock-off?
You get what you pay for with a knock-off: inferior quality. "You'd be lucky to sell it for $50 the next day," says James, "and it'll eventually end up as landfill."
Reissued classics by manufacturers such as Fritz Hansen and Vitra are handy if you're after, say, six identical Hans Wegner Wishbone chairs for your dining room, at $1,000 a pop. But take heed: "Once they leave the showroom, they'll lose 30 per cent of their value, like a car," says McClymont.
A mint-condition vintage Wishbone, by contrast, might cost $500 and will appreciate. "The only time I'd advise someone to buy new is when the piece is rare, like Juhl's NV45 chairs. You could wait years for a pair, and when they go to auction, they sell for ridiculous money."
Choose your dealer carefully
The Internet is invaluable for shopping, but use it as a means to an end. Many online portals are staffed by rookies at best, who don't know an Arne Jacobsen from the generic, and at worst by cowboys. The veteran portal 1st Dibs is an exception: trustworthy, albeit expensive. It monitors potential merchants for years before allowing them to sell through the site, "so you know you're going to get quality," says Israel Jones, owner of the Swanky Abode in Ohio.
Enthusiasts should frequent vintage-furniture fairs and storefront dealers. "Build a rapport," Curtis says. " You won't get the same ground knowledge from a sales assistant." Crucially, well-known dealers get right of first refusal when locals sell off their contents. "People in their 80s walk into the shop with pictures and ask, 'Do you want this stuff?'" says James. "And that's the best stuff." If you can get on the waiting lists of your favourite dealers, they'll come to you with the best merch.
Identify quality
Once you've zeroed in on a find, sit on it. Assess if the shock mounts are firmly attached. Check for corner brackets, used by amateurs to repair broken teak - they'll drag down the value. Take into account whether the whole chair is original or a marriage of disparate parts. Ask about provenance. Then Google the name for marks of authenticity. For example, Eames DSW chairs were made of Fiberglas while reissues are inferior plastic. Early models manufactured by Zenith have a checkerboard label ; models by Cincinatti Milacron have a crescent "C."
Danish teak of the early postwar period has a more interesting grain than the farmed teak of later stock. "And if it's upholstered," says Israel Jones, "research whether the upholstery is genuine."
Spot an opportunity to save
Dealers don't tend to have sales - unless they want a big turnout at a furniture fair. "When they're selling at the Midcentury Modern Show in London," says Curtis, "they offer a special one-day discount of 10 per cent."
There's a lot of leeway on the hunt for a cheap Eames chair. Later models, or pieces with replacement legs, can go for well under $1,000. And in the Eames world, orange is the new black - in the 1950s, orange chairs were mass-produced whereas seafoam and grey are rare - and more expensive. By contrast, an early-1950s, mint-condition Eames rocker will put you back $3,700.
Prices vary across regions, however. In big retirement destinations, where people tend to sell off their collections, stock is plentiful so prices come down. "Palm Springs and Florida are good places to look," says Curtis. The Canadian equivalent is Victoria, where a cluster of Danish-modern stores in the 1950s and '60s sold to young families. "Now, when those same people downsize into apartments," says James, "they give us a call."

I live in downtown Toronto, in Cabbagetown. Perhaps you've attended one of our (I'm convinced) real-estate-agent-sponsored festivals or craft fairs. We're Toronto's go-to destination for $90 wind chimes three days a year, should you find yourself in need of vintage cutlery on a string. It's like Tron that weekend except that, instead of a mainframe, I'm trapped in Etsy.
Maybe you've taken a walking tour of our neighbourhood's historic homes, and I've ruined your perfect photograph of a gentrified Victorian house. I'm pretty sure the local No Frills, which has its finger on the pulse of these streets, intentionally discounts jumbo packages of toilet paper (the good stuff) during these tours because I always seem to find myself proudly (score!) walking through someone's shot with an enormous bale of toilet paper on my shoulder, and I see neighbours doing the same.
Just south of Cabbagetown lies Regent Park - the largest and oldest social-housing development in Canada. The original design for the 28 hectares of subsidized low-rises and row-houses - built to replace the slums that were the original, unreal-estate-agented Cabbagetown until the 1940s (the cute name was co-opted by what was until then called Don Vale) - wasn't, from the outside, dissimilar to the University of British Columbia student housing where I lived as a little girl. This may in part explain why I've always liked Regent Park.
The homes were clustered around courts to provide lots of green space, light and a homey scale. The good intention of this design was still visible beneath the disrepair (trouble began to set in the 1960s) when I bought my home in the 1990s.
This decrepitude and crime - partly enabled by the courtyards, which seemed ideal but separated the neighbourhood from main streets and made policing difficult - gave the area a bad reputation.
Once, when driving friends in from the airport, I was asked, "What's that area?" as we went by, and replied: "That, I'm told, is Canada's worst housing development." My eyes were on the road, so I didn't understand why they all laughed until, turning the corner, I saw a croquet game, complete with little girls in Alice in Wonderland dresses, in progress. My guests (from Los Angeles and New York) never quite took our country seriously after that.
I don't want to play down the depressing and sometimes dangerous problems caused by a minority of its residents, but that croquet level of community has always been apparent to me in Regent Park. Walking through the area early on a summer evening I'd hear strains, sometimes barrages, of different music fade in and fade out. That unintentionally artful mix, coupled with the olfactory fusion produced by the assortment of barbecues (there's a large immigrant population), and with the children, not confined to their parents' barbecues but playing together, was Canada working.
For several years, in a plan developed under former mayor David Miller with much thoughtful, diligent community input, Regent Park has been undergoing a transformation. Residents are being moved out in shifts and then, if they choose, back to new homes. Creative financing is allowing some who were renting to buy the new condominiums that are changing the housing mix from fully subsidized to about 60 per cent at market rates, partly financing the transformation while doubling the density. There is new arts and community space. In the spring, a large park will open beside the best public pool in which I've ever swum.
Last summer I tried out the pool during a ladies-only swim, something Regent Park's sizable Muslim population makes essential. I assumed it would be quiet. I was wrong. The blinds were drawn, and the place went wild. They let us use the Tarzan swing. There's a water slide and a fountain in the children's pool. It's better than it has to be.
As I walked home, four teenage girls, two wearing hijabs, walked my way, looking at me and exchanging remarks. There I was, warm dust on my still-damp toes, rolled-up towel under my arm and feeling 12 again - self-conscious, wondering why they were looking at me. Then, as they passed, one girl said: "We really like your skirt."
Something else is being said here, I thought as I left Regent Park, where a city is doing something bold but researched, clever but elegant - ensuring that people get housing they deserve and reminding us we can build great cities rather than endure bad ones. Those girls were smiling at me, welcoming me and, with a certain pride, they were saying: "Yeah, you can totally come use our pool," and I do.

Full text:   It has kind of become the way we do things in Vancouver: present an initial idea, spend a couple of years getting city staff to put flesh on the bones, try to get the affected communities and stakeholders involved, hold some workshops, some community meetings that rely heavily on Expo markers, newsprint flipboards and the made-up verb "visioning." Then get city staff to write up a several-hundred-page report on it, appoint an unlucky lead councillor to carry the message, and finally release the thing to the public to a wall of opposition. Marpole, Grandview-Woodland, Oakridge, the West End - just some of the neighbourhoods where opponents of redevelopment plans have forced council to backtrack, rethink, or delay their plans.
But the Downtown Eastside Local Area Plan is the mother of them all.
This is the plan to spend $1-billion of fictional money over the next 30 years to remake, finally, what former mayor and former B.C. premier Mike Harcourt referred to this week as "not just the poorest postal code in Canada but a place that is appalling in its human wreckage."
Mr. Harcourt told CBC this week: "The present reality is 100-per-cent failure."
And remember, this is coming from a fan of the neighbourhood who is quick to talk about its historical significance and its importance as one of the few places left for people with little or no money.
The plan calls for 4,400 new social-housing units to be built in the Downtown Eastside over the next 30 years, and another 3,300 elsewhere in the city. Single-room occupancy (SRO) hotels would be upgraded or eventually replaced, and rents would be heavily subsidized.
The plan depends on other levels of government contributing about half the funding, with the other half coming mostly from the city and developers.
City Councillor Andrea Reimer told me earlier this week that the city can go it alone if necessary, albeit on a much smaller scale. But she says at the very least, having a plan makes it more likely that the province and federal government will get on board.
So far, the provincial minister responsible for housing, Rich Coleman, has offered a blunt "no" each time he is asked whether the province will contribute. So there's that.
But by far the most contentious part of the proposal is that the core of the neighbourhood the city calls DEOD (Downtown Eastside Oppenheimer District) would be a condo-free zone. The district, which includes Main and Hastings streets and the area surrounding Oppenheimer Park, would require any new housing to be 60 per cent social housing and 40 per cent rental.
On one end, you have critics such as architect and developer Michael Geller, who say barring condos from the Oppenheimer District would lead to the "ghettoization" of the area, and that, without the significant contributions of developers, the plan would fail.
On the other side, you have the Carnegie Community Action Project, which is demanding that more housing units be built, that 60 per cent be social housing, and that the units are actually affordable to people on social assistance or pensions. The CCAP also wants what it calls "a social justice" zone. A statement on the group's website reads, "The future of the Downtown Eastside (DTES) is being decided by rich real estate investors and developers who are profiting off changing the neighbourhood from a place where low-income people feel at home into yet another upscale area."
It was Ms. Reimer who reminded me that the previous housing plan for the Downtown Eastside was approved in 2005. It was mainly concerned with making sure SROs were not replaced with condominiums. Feel free to debate how well that went.
Around the same time, there was The Vancouver Agreement. Remember that one - three levels of government would work together to solve "the problem" of the Downtown Eastside? After listing its accomplishments over its 10-year lifespan, the final report concluded in 2010, "Although one agreement cannot completely erase serious systemic problems such as poverty, drug addiction and homelessness, it can spark a renewal. The Vancouver Agreement directed fresh people, ideas, policies and practices at old problems."
And maybe that's the best we can hope for. Every few years, a new set of people will muster the energy to consult with the community and experts, gather data, get out the flipboards and markers and hold those public meetings. They'll talk about maintaining the Downtown Eastside as a "vibrant" and "caring" community and gloss over the brutal realities of the place.
And very little will change.

Full text:   They're some of the most polarizing political figures around. But city leaders also govern the places where this century's most intractable problems play out - and where solutions are most likely to be found. That's why they should have more, not less, power than heads of state, argues political theorist Benjamin Barber. In a recent TED Talk and a new book, he calls for an international 'parliament of mayors' to lead us. Are they up to the task? Our panel weighs in on a provocative idea
*******
Benjamin Barber
Political theorist and author of
If Mayors Ruled the World:
Dysfunctional Nations, Rising Cities.
Our political world is increasingly defined by dysfunctional states in which 18th-century independent nations hemmed in by sovereignty and borders are ever less able to address 21st-century cross-border challenges. In this ever-more-interdependent and globalized world, new political responses are required. It is time to change the subject: from states to cities, from prime ministers and presidents to mayors.
For while we live in a world of climate change without borders, immigration without borders, terrorism without borders, banks without borders, technology without borders, disease without borders and crime without borders, we have neither citizens without borders, nor nations without borders, nor democracy without borders.
Yet where nations have failed to arrest climate change or deal with immigration, cities are succeeding in multiple intercity organizations from the C-40 climate cities focused on carbon emissions, to the United Cities and Local Governments (UCLG) the network - the world's most important organization nobody has ever heard of.
Cities are not just another "level of government administration" where problems get solved; they are where civilization and democracy originated; they are the natural communities that define social life among human beings. Cities represent the warp and woof of everyday life - they are forgers of identity, where citizens are born, educated, grow up, get married, play, pray, work and eventually die. They are the human habitat that make us an "urban species," as Edward Glaeser described us.
The word "citizen" is rooted in the term "city," while the defining features of urbanity - density, pluralism, creativity, diversity, innovation, entrepreneurship, mobility, tolerance and endless interactivity - are the source of both the culture and wealth of cities. Small wonder cities are inclined to co-operation and exchange. They are built on water (90 per cent of the world's cities grew up on rivers, lakes, seas and oceans) and today house over half the world's population (nearly 80 per cent of the developed world's people). They generate nearly 80 per cent of global GDP, and represent the majority in every democratic nation in the world, even though they remain "subsidiary" to nation-states and often in thrall to rural and countryside regions.
Cities work and flourish in our new interdependent world because mayors are pragmatic not ideological, consensual rather than tyrannical, wedded to civic engagement not disdainful of citizens. Mayors are problem-solvers first of all. Twice in the last several years, the government of the United States "closed" - and nobody much noticed. But imagine closing Toronto or Chicago or Mexico City or Vancouver. No police, no hospitals, no buses, no schools? No firemen or teachers or sanitation workers? No way. You can't close cities. Even in the Middle Ages under conditions of siege and plague, cities functioned.
If, then, we are to survive in a global world of brute interdependent problems, if we are to find sustainable ways to grow and just ways to share wealth, we will have to do it together - "glocally" (both globally and locally) - with the help of mayors and the cities and citizens they represent. We will need not only intercity associations and cross-border co-operation, but a global parliament of mayors in which urban public goods become the model for global public goods. In cities, we will find a road forward, and a new basis for hope in the future of democracy.
Charles Montgomery
Urbanist and author of Happy City: Transforming Our Lives Through Urban Design.
Should mayors have a larger role in national and international affairs? In short: yes. My argument comes down to the psychology of decision-making. Behavioural economists have been providing strong evidence to suggest that we humans often fail to maximize utility - or choose what's best for us - in the long run. We're not always well-equipped to make choices on issues that involve complex systems, like cities. At the same time, the farther we are, geographically or emotionally, from any particular problem, the less weight we tend to give it. This is especially true of politicians. In an era when cities are increasingly faced with the consequences of global forces such as climate change, migration and inequity, local mayors tend to feel a greater sense of urgency around issues that barely register for national and even provincial decision-makers. Yet too often, mayors depend on higher-level politicians for permission even to make basic local decisions. Just look at Metro Vancouver, where nearly all the local stakeholders agree on the urgent need for new investment in public transit. It hasn't happened, because the power to make decisions over transit funding belongs to the province. So the region is stuck in traffic, and contributing to high carbon emissions that will, one day, contribute to flooding in Metro Vancouver and cities around the world. (Luckily, local mayors are currently working on a plan to take that power back.)
It's time for the people who live and feel interwoven in local-global issues to play a greater role in responding to them.
Gregor Robertson
Mayor of Vancouver.
When you look at the challenges that cities face today, there's no question mayors deserve a larger role in national and international affairs. Climate change, immigration, economic stagnation - these used to be viewed as the responsibility of the federal government. That's no longer the case. These issues are playing out in the streets and neighbourhoods of cities, and at the same time we're seeing a retrenchment of the federal government. The era of city hall's role beginning and ending with garbage collection is woefully out of date, because cities are being forced into action. And increasingly, there is an expectation from citizens that city hall can and should step up to address these issues. The strongest reason for cities and mayors to have a more prominent role is that cities are better positioned than they've ever been to help national and provincial or state governments achieve their goals. In Canada, economic activity is being driven from cities, so any government that is serious about growing a strong, resilient economy will invest in them, through infrastructure for transit or social programs. Cities are also proving to be more entrepreneurial on policy innovation. In Vancouver, we have the ability to set our own building code, and drive the pace of energy efficiency. That makes a big difference when over half of our greenhouse gases come from buildings. So all levels of government that want to act on climate change and affordable housing should empower cities to meet their targets.
Doug Saunders
The Globe's international affairs columnist and the author of
Arrival City: The Final Migration
and Our Next World.
I agree with Benjamin Barber's "global parliament of mayors" proposal in principle - because, as he notes, cities, and especially big cities, are where the most important opportunities, challenges and solutions to global problems will be played out during this century, and their mayors are indeed a crucial source of on-the-ground policy knowledge. In practice, though, I wonder if this would have much impact nationally or internationally, beyond its obvious value as a forum for mayors to share policies and best practices (which is valuable enough on its own).
For one thing, municipal leadership rarely translates to the national or international level: It is a form of political organization, and a set of skills, radically different from those needed in parliamentary, party-based politics. The issues involved are indeed at the core of every nation's current concern, but the sort of compromises and tradeoffs that guide national politics are alien to the world of sharp and total policy decisions that govern cities.
Municipal politics tends to be less democratic, in the technical sense, than provincial or national politics: There are fewer people voting, fewer citizens aware who their representatives are, fewer media outlets watching the politicians and their deliberations, fewer high-profile watchdog bodies. This means that the success or failure of city governance tends to depend, far more than at other levels, upon the character and leadership abilities of the mayors at the helm. This means that mayors are more likely to be bold geniuses or dismal failures, with little in between. It's a type of leadership, and power, that bears little resemblance to parliamentary government (or even to many forms of republican government). This may be why not a single big-city mayor has become president of the United States, and only one has ever become prime minister of Canada.
For another thing, the definition of "mayor" varies dramatically from place to place. In the English-speaking countries of the Western world, municipal governments collect property tax and determine their own policies; in U.S. and British "strong mayor" cities, the mayor often has extraordinary executive power to do this. In Europe, municipalities are often branches of the national government, completely funded by transfers and grants, and big-city mayors are cabinet members - Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi will not have to quit his other job as mayor of Florence. In the Indian subcontinent, mayors as we know them are virtually nonexistent; cities are governed by various bodies whose functions compete and overlap.
It would be difficult to build consensus among such a disparate group of local politicians with such different governing experiences. It would still be worth doing - but I fear that mayors, despite being the most trusted and effective politicians in the world today, will continue to have a difficult time climbing into higher politics.

"My main challenge is how I can quickly increase the welfare of the people in Surabaya, how I can lift people above the poverty line so they have a better life."
Tri Rismaharini, mayor of Surabaya, Indonesia, since 2010
"Since there is no money to buy votes, politicians actually have to produce results."
Yiannis Boutaris, mayor of Thessaloniki, Greece, since 2010
"Cities are not only the oldest of institutions, they're the most enduring. If you think about it, Constantinople, Istanbul, [is] much older than Turkey. Alexandria, much older than Egypt.
Rome, far older than Italy. Cities endure the ages ... They are home. Very different than nation-states,which are abstractions. We pay taxes, we vote occasionally, we watch the men and women we choose rule more or less without us. Not so in those homes known as our towns and cities where we live."
Benjamin Barber, TED Talk
*******
The issue is not a shortage of ideas from mayors and others, but rather a sustainable funding formula for municipalities, outside of property tax. Open up bonds, pension funds and private investors to infrastructure opportunities and you will unleash an economic explosion with jobs and benefits directed by mayors and councils.
Steve Mahoney1
City governments too easily fall under the sway of big-money real-estate developers and it is far too easy for mayors and other officials to become far too close to local business leaders. The result? Sweetheart deals and selling out the public interest over and over again.
sageantoine
Big-city mayors don't make great state or national politicians. It is a very different type of leadership. The best example of this is Rob Ford. The most serious problem with his leadership, besides all the buffoonery, is that he could not adjust from being a local councillor gadfly to being a leader with a broader vision and sense of purpose for the City of Toronto. Those skills are even more significant when jumping from the local to the national stage in politics.
J.K. Galbraith
Mayors may seem more effective [than other politicians] but that is because the scope of their governments and electors is more limited. They have fewer issues to manage. They would not likely be any more effective than the modern nation state in managing the diversity of issues surrounding trade agreements, foreign policy, etc.

I don't know if they should have more power, but for sure [the election process for mayors] needs to be taken more seriously. Just take a look at the embarrassments that Toronto (our largest and most influential city) regularly elects as mayor! Perhaps once we have serious mayoral elections in this country we can talk about whether mayors should start to have more power. However, politics should never become too locally dominated. Rural areas support cities and vice versa. Policy decisions should be made that balance the needs of rural and urban areas. Grumpy Scientist

Full text:   Former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg thinks he knows. His next big project is a charity to advise cities around the world - and despite his critics, Alex Bozikovic reports, they might be wise to listen
If you leave Manhattan for Brooklyn on the No. 3 train, you'll end up at New Lots Avenue. Here, just under the elevated platform, is where Eddie Di Benedetto has had his pizzeria, Caterina's, since 1971. "The area was always being plagued with crime," Mr. Di Benedetto says. The plaza out front of his restaurant didn't help: it was poorly lit, noisy, and buses roared past every few minutes. "When people got off the train, they rushed to just get home."
Then he and some neighbouring merchants asked the city, under Mayor Michael Bloomberg, to fix it. "We heard Mayor Bloomberg was very big on plazas and open space," he says. Across the city, the transportation department was installing pedestrian plazas, making the streets more inviting. "There was a cry for improvement - we heard the cry and we just followed."
Someone heard them, too: The buses took a different route. The city installed a temporary plaza, with seating and umbrellas, for the warmer months. People now linger. Crime is down.
"I asked, and we got what we wanted," Mr. Di Benedetto says. "Even in East New York, my friend. I hear bad things about Mayor Bloomberg, but what we got is an extension of his idealism, right?"
This is not how most people think of Mr. Bloomberg, who recently stepped down after 12 years as mayor and who is the city's richest resident. Under his leadership, New York became a land of wealth and plenty, at least for some - in Midtown Manhattan, glassy new high-rises contain the third homes of Russian billionaires; downtown, tourists order $38 steak frites at Balthazar and walk the High Line, an innovative park built with donations from the rich.
Yet the plaza at New Lots Avenue reflects the scope of Mr. Bloomberg's impact. His administration - freed by his wealth and his lack of political debts - turned New York into a laboratory for urban innovation of all kinds, from small neighbourhood improvements to rezoning vast swaths of land, shaking up its demographics and its economy. The city cut carbon emissions, and got rid of smoking in public. (Tobacco, that is.)
Mr. Bloomberg's administration shared some of its lessons with other civic leaders; Eduardo Paes, the mayor of Rio de Janeiro, has consulted publicly with Mr. Bloomberg. And now the Bloombergians are preparing to share their lessons with the world. Several top lieutenants have moved on to work for Bloomberg Associates, a consultancy that will advise cities free of charge on how to "improve the quality of life of their citizens." He also sponsors a Mayor's Challenge, which asks cities (this year in Europe) to innovate in pursuit of EUR9-million in prizes.
Mr. Bloomberg provides an important example for mayors everywhere, at a time when mayors matter: More than half the world's population lives in cities, and that number is projected to reach 70 per cent by 2050. (According to Statistics Canada, more than 80 per cent of Canadians live in cities and suburbs.) This demands new infrastructure, changes to the physical form of cities and new ways of doing things.
What happened in New York may not be the singular recipe for 21st-century urbanism - the city became greener, cleaner and more hospital to the world, but also more expensive and less hospitable to the poor. But the changes in New York from 2001 to 2013, driven by faith in hard data, as well as the magic of place, is still the single example that can't be avoided.
After 9/11
Mr. Bloomberg became mayor of New York in 2001 with just 50.7 per cent of the vote, after spending nearly $74-million (U.S.) to get himself elected. Well-known as the force behind his data and media company, he was a political novice, and his challenges were tremendous: New York was reeling from the 9/11 attacks, in fiscal trouble, uncertain about the future. The financial sector seemed ready to disperse to office parks in Connecticut and New Jersey, threatening the city's economy. The idea of the skyscraper, New York's central building block, was under threat.
"Had things worked a little differently, we would have been looking back on the decline of New York from that moment," says Justin Davidson, architecture critic for New York magazine. "I don't think he gets all the credit, but he did a lot of things right."
The city has added hundreds of thousands of new residents, seen real-estate prices skyrocket (and recover, after being hit hard by the recession in 2009), and become much safer and cleaner than it was.
How did it happen? Mr. Bloomberg - an entrepreneur who made his $33-billion (U.S.) fortune serving the needs of Wall Street - worked hard to keep Big Finance in the city through tax breaks and personal lobbying; and he made the city's police department into a globally active anti-terror organization, while overseeing a drop in crime.
He also reformed the city's thorny public education system, with modest improvements in test scores; pushed for an expansion of higher education, including a new grad-school campus of Cornell University; and encouraged a knowledge-economy by courting investments in Manhattan's "Silicon Alley" and bio-tech.
Mr. Bloomberg has a passionate interest in public health, too. Beginning in his first term he pushed a smoking ban in restaurants and bars, making New York the largest American city to do so, and then in parks. The bans were unpopular with restaurateurs and many vocal New Yorkers ("We're moving towards a totalitarian society," one city councillor argued when the parks regulation was passed).
The scientific evidence was clear, though - and Mr. Bloomberg was committed to making policy through information. One of his favourite aphorisms is "In God we trust. All others bring data." This attitude came to govern much of the city's management. He established an Office of Policy and Strategic Planning, whose task was to use public data to improve services - from garbage collection to cutting air pollution.
Mr. Bloomberg also aimed for big targets in sustainability, a goal with long-term consequence and very little political payoff. A vision set out in 2007, PlaNYC established a wide range of goals: from new playgrounds, to congestion pricing to deter cars (which never passed), to curbing carbon emissions from buildings (which did).
The latter was policy with a real impact - the Empire State Building got a refit that cut its energy use by 38 per cent - but very little reward. "He deserves credit ... this is the unsexy stuff that makes a huge difference," says Rosalie Genevro, the executive director of the Architectural League of New York, a local non-profit.
The city's real estate landscape saw dramatic shifts as well. A wave of new development transformed swaths of Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens, creating new homes for some of the 300,000 people who moved to New York in the Bloomberg era.
At the same time, rents rose significantly across the city; many New Yorkers now fear being left behind by the city's economic growth. They see Mr. Bloomberg's agenda as having reshaped the city as a playground for the wealthy and visitors from overseas. Mr. Bloomberg's successor, Bill de Blasio, ran for office on the slogan "A Tale of Two Cities."
New York in 2001 was among the most expensive cities in North America, and it's grown more so. The social cost of gentrification has been real. The city now has 50,000 people, a record, in its homeless shelters. Yet the situation is complex: its rental market is highly regulated, and its affordable and public housing programs are by far the largest on the continent. Mr. Bloomberg added 165,000 affordable units, largely in new private-sector market-rate buildings - which often made the surrounding areas more expensive.
There is no question that Mr. Bloomberg successfully encouraged economic growth for the city as whole, and partly through some soft tactics: his team was sensitive to urban design and the intangible qualities that make a city great.
The Place-Makers
In 2009, New York got a new park like no other. The High Line recast an old elevated rail line as a promenade between the industrial buildings in the West Chelsea area of Manhattan. It was initially opposed by the city but won the support of many neighbours, architects and urbanists - including the planner Amanda Burden, whom Mr. Bloomberg appointed as his planning director. Built with help from donors such as Edward Norton, the High Line became an enormous success, overrun by tourists. It also radically gentrified the area: The city rezoned the district for luxury development, and soon star architects like Frank Gehry were designing office and residential buildings.
The High Line is now being expanded into a third phase, which will connect directly into Hudson Yards - a $15-billion (U.S.) office and residential development built above a rail yard. That project, co-developed by Canada's Oxford Properties, was Mr. Bloomberg's baby. It will house offices for Time Warner, L'Oreal and luxury brand Coach.
Presumably, Coach designers will enjoy walking the High Line as much as the wealthy Chinese tourists who are buying their handbags. One central insight of the Bloomberg administration was that visitors, entrepreneurs and knowledge workers would be drawn by the same magnet: a culturally rich and beautiful city with attractive public space.
If that seems obvious, Mr. Bloomberg's people were, in the early days after 2001, going against the grain. It was a moment when many kinds of professional work seemed likely to disperse into the suburbs and beyond.
"They were arguing the importance of being in a dense urban place to creative and economic endeavours that don't look like they need it," Mr. Davidson argues. "The Internet had decentralized investment. There was this sense that everyone could move out of the city without paying a price in terms of being plugged in and connected."
But New York had to become the place that everybody wanted to be. It did, through some surprising means. Under Mr. Bloomberg, the streets of New York didn't just take on a different atmosphere. The streets changed, physically.
I was working in Midtown Manhattan in 2003 and remember making the mildly unpleasant walk down Broadway, from 34th to 23rd Street; the avenue still lined with wholesalers, the narrow sidewalks often blocked, car and truck traffic belching and racing downtown. People on bikes survived, barely. Now that stretch has been branded as "NoMad," and the Ace Hotel - which is the physical embodiment of the word "hipster" - is in the middle of it; there are also a bike lane and two public plazas. On one of the plazas, opposite the famous Flatiron Building, you can sit at a cafe table (under a blue umbrella), have a coffee, and check in on free WiFi.
Thousands of locals and tourists use that Flatiron Plaza every day, despite the fact that there's a very nice park right across the street. It provides room for people to gather and be among other people. It also means a bit less room for car traffic. This is all part of the plan for these plazas, implemented by Mr. Bloomberg's transportation commissioner, Janette Sadik-Khan - who is another hire at Bloomberg Associates. The plazas began quietly, as temporary installations in places where car traffic was confusing. When the experiments worked, they were rolled out more broadly and made permanent.
For Mr. Bloomberg's people, there is a clear link between the private gain and the public good. Many North American politicians haven't understood that public space affects real-estate value, but the Bloomberg administration set out to capitalize on it. Just as Central Park created great wealth in the 19th century, they hoped to do so with new parks in the 21st - about 300 hectares-worth. "Good design is good economic development," Ms. Burden told the New York Times in 2012.
Tourism was another high priority for Mr. Bloomberg's administration, which saw it as both business and cultural diplomacy. He installed an advertising executive, George Fertitta, to head the local tourism authority, and the city hit a series of new records for visitors: the number rose from 43.8 million in 2006 to an estimated 54 million in 2013, with international visitors increasing by 50 per cent. Those foreigners spend much more money than domestic visitors, and their presence pays untold returns in goodwill and investment.
The global super-rich have also been buying real estate, as a forest of luxury buildings pops up in Midtown Manhattan. Mr. Bloomberg has welcomed this: "If we could get every billionaire in the world to move here, that would be a godsend," he said last fall in response to questions about rising inequality.
Those remarks hit a cultural nerve that's been exposed for a decade now. The inner-Brooklyn neighbourhoods that welcomed artists in 2000 are now filling with Wall Streeters; many people argue that the city's pursuit of the affluent is destroying the city's creative energy. The legendary musician David Byrne, who moved to New York in the '70s when the city was at its lowest, is worried that New York "will be a city closer to Hong Kong or Abu Dhabi than to the rich fertile place it has historically been," he wrote last fall. "Those places might have museums, but they don't have culture."
Mr. Bloomberg's strong support for high culture, including his own private donations, can't fix that. The question, in the long term, is whether the city's considerable draws - and more remote neighbourhoods - will be big enough for a new generation of creators.
The Bloomberg Mission
Many of the Bloomberg administration's ideas aren't original; rather they reflect some best practices in urbanism around the world. (Ms. Sadik-Khan borrowed some notions about streetscapes from European cities.) And that may mean they will travel well to other cities through the work of Bloomberg Associates.
The details are still unclear, but Mr. Bloomberg's philanthropic efforts - and there are many - suggest some of the routes the consultancy might take. His Bloomberg Philanthropies works on five major themes: the arts, education, the environment, government innovation, and public health. There is the Mayor's Challenge, which asks cities to "define a serious problem and craft a bold solution." Each of 20 finalists, to be announced next month, will send a team of four to an "Ideas Camp" to refine them, then resubmit them, and - in October - four winners will take prizes of EUR1-million, and one will take EUR5-million.
If that process sounds complex, it is; there is a presumption that city governments are not good at innovating. One of the criteria is to say "We are the first city to..." Another asks: "Are you using talent, partners and resources outside of city government in a meaningful way?"
What do the results look like? Last year's finalists, drawn from American cities, included a "well-being metric" to shape policy in Santa Monica, Calif; a revision to recycling programs in Houston that allow citizens to use one bin for everything; and a program called "Providence Talks," which gives low-income children in Rhode Island language and reading support.
That diversity suggests the scope of Bloomberg Associates. "I think it's great that they're going to be a voice out in the world," says Brent Toderian, a leading planning consultant and Vancouver's former chief planner. "But it'll be interesting to see how the conversation goes. It's not necessarily so that every city wants to be like New York. The best conversations are looking at examples from around the world."
And some of the specific planning and urban design policies that worked in New York, Mr. Toderian points out, won't fly without the dense, diverse cityscape that New York offers.
On the other hand, the scale of Mr. Bloomberg's success has helped create a new climate where cities see each other as peers and share ideas freely. And, as Mr. Davidson says, correctly: "Bloomberg gets a lot of credit for that. The idea that a mayor can do something that has an impact - and large cities have a lot more in common across national borders? That's powerful."

Full text:   Victorian beauty houses seven bedrooms, nine bathrooms, six fireplaces, a shoe polishing room and a dog washing station
THE LISTING
Asking price: $5.5-million
Taxes: $21,579 (2013)
Lot size: 104 by 135 feet
Agent: Alex Irish (ReMax Aboutowne Realty Corp.)
The back story
The Victorian mansion at 43 Dunn St. was built for Cecil Marlatt in 1880. Mr. Marlatt was the owner of the Marlatt and Armstrong Tannery and a well-known supporter of the Royal Canadian Yacht Club.
The original property stretched to the edge of Lake Ontario to the south, with an orchard of fruit trees in front of the house. A greenhouse, playhouse, stables and two fish ponds also occupied the surrounding land. Afternoon tea was served in a summer house that overlooked a cricket pitch and a lawn tennis court, according to real estate agent Alex Irish of ReMax Aboutowne Realty Corp.
Over time, more houses were built on the streets of Olde Oakville. The house at 43 Dunn is about one block from the water and two blocks from the centre of downtown shopping in Oakville.
The current owners, Clive and Hilary Maile, lived on the waterfront in the late 1990s when they went for a walk through the undulating streets of Olde Oakville and saw a "for sale" sign in front of No. 43.
Mr. Maile astonished his wife by blurting out, "we have to buy it."
The couple had not been planning to move but Mr. Maile, who grew up in a Victorian house in the seaside town of Brighton in England, thought that the opportunity to buy such a prominent local residence was too rare to pass up.
He also admired the elaborate corbels, herringbone and other patterns of the brick exterior.
The Mailes arranged to see it right away.
"We knew as soon as we walked in," says Ms. Maile. "This is meant to be."
The house today
The couple loved the interior of the three-story house but it was in need of renewal, say the Mailes, who spent two years overseeing a complete renovation. Fireplaces had been bricked up in years past and some of the decor was tired.
The renovation allowed the couple to replace the wiring and heating systems and to add modern plumbing and air conditioning.
"We gutted it completely," says Mr. Maile. "To the bare brickwork."
They also found historic photos of the home, which allowed them to replicate original elements such as the wide front porch, intricate brick work, wrought iron accents and gingerbread fretwork.
"The original porch was rounded so we took it back to that."
Throughout the house, the Mailes restored the plaster mouldings, stained glass windows and Victorian hardware. They searched antique shops in Britain and France and throughout North America for fireplace mantles, period chandeliers and door handles. A marble-topped commode imported from France was turned into a vanity for the main-floor powder room.
Mr. Maile says they made few changes to the original layout, but they opened up some rooms and maximized the amount of daylight coming in.
"They get it so right in a Victorian home," he says of the space and volume in the principal rooms. "In this house you feel the continuity as you walk through."
Visitors entering the front door immediately see the floating staircase, with detailed floral scrolling and carved newel posts. Stand at the base and look up and you can see all the way to the top of the third floor.
Carved oak pillars mark the transition from living room to dining room. Beyond that, a conservatory leads to the garden.
Mr. Maile worked closely with the Oakville Historical Society, he says, to ensure that the addition would fall within the heritage conservation rules that preserve Olde Oakville.
"You've got to keep the character. That's what's so beautiful about living downtown."
At the rear of the house, a large kitchen and its adjoining keeping room have views of Lake Ontario.
The Lacanche range was imported from France. The cabinets were made by an British-based firm who sent a craftsman over to do the installation.
"For weeks he was here," says Mr. Maile.
The house has nearly 10,000 square feet, so there is plenty of room for the seven bedrooms, nine bathrooms and six fireplaces. It also includes a shoe polishing room, a dog washing station and a packing room with built-in cupboards custom-built for suitcases.
An elevator fitted with Victorian hardware glides between the four floors from basement to attic.
A one-bedroom suite in the coach house can provide living quarters for a nanny or inlaws.
Ms. Irish says she has never listed a property that has inspired so much curiosity. She can tell by the flood of traffic on her website as visitors click through the photographs.
"It's the house that people ask me about in town," says Ms. Irish. "It's an Oakville landmark."
The best feature
The addition of the conservatory provides an indoor space surrounded by the outdoors. It has tall windows, curved stained glass transoms, 10-foot-high doors and a roof lantern.
Mr. Maile says that opening the French doors to the walled courtyard and its elaborate fountain lets guests move easily between the interior and the outdoors.
"We've had some beautiful parties in here for up to 100 people."

Abstract: "I was impressed," said John Bill Keck, a silver-haired real estate developer who said the lunchtime event was his first exposure to Mr. [Matt Bevin]. Mr. Keck said he agreed with Mr. Bevin's forceful call for limiting the terms of elected representatives. He sought out Mr. Bevin for a picture and left asking campaign staff where he could make a donation.

Full text:   In another state, or maybe at some other moment in the future, Republican elders would be recruiting Matt Bevin. However, this is Kentucky and it is 2014. So the establishment is trying to crush him.
The Republican Party styles itself as the proper home for "job creators" and the protector of the Christian traditions on which the country was founded. Mr. Bevin, 47, is a successful entrepreneur who has a hand in 10 companies. He and his wife have nine children, five of their own and four of them adopted. The family car is a 12-seat, silver van that Mrs. Bevin calls "Apollo 12."
But this dream candidate is more nightmare for the Republican masterminds back in Washington who are trying to orchestrate a return to majority status in the Senate that would frustrate the final two years of Barack Obama's presidency. Such an outcome at midterm elections in November is entirely possible.
The Republican lead in the House is too great for the Democratic Party to overcome and only one Republican senator - the popular Susan Collins of Maine - is facing re-election in a state won by Mr. Obama in 2012. Meanwhile, Democratic incumbents are on the run in a half dozen states that lean Republican and upsets are possible in places such as Colorado and New Hampshire. Republicans need a net gain of six seats to win back the majority.
One would think the smell of victory would unite the party. Not yet. Mr. Bevin is seeking to take out one of the most influential figures in Washington, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. A handful of others who, like Mr. Bevin, are benefiting from the support of various Tea Party groups, are challenging incumbents in primaries that began this past week in Texas and will continue through the spring. The outcomes of these nominating contests could determine not control of the Senate but ultimately who controls the Republican party.
"Republicans are going to pick up seats. It's just a question of how many," said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia's Center for Politics and editor-in-chief of Crystal Ball, a website focused on forecasting election outcomes.
The Republican upstarts, who, for the most part, are backed by various Tea Party groups, face long odds. Incumbency has significant advantages and the business lobby is rallying around the candidates it knows. John Cornyn, Texas's senior senator, beat his challenger by a wide margin on Tuesday. But primary challenges count: In 2012, Richard Lugar, a five-term senator from Indiana, lost the nomination after he took his Tea Party challenger too lightly. The victor, a polarizing state official called Richard Mourdock, then lost the election, costing the Republicans a Senate seat they had held safely for more than three decades.
Mr. McConnell, who has represented Kentucky since 1984, already has raised more than $18.2-million (U.S.) - compared with about $21-million in his campaign in 2008 - even though the election still is seven months away. Much of that war chest is being used to fund attack ads aimed at Mr. Bevin, who is seeking elected office for the first time and has raised a mere $1.7-million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign funding.
"It's all about slash, attack and burn," Mr. Bevin said of Mr. McConnell's campaign at an event earlier this week in this eastern Kentucky town. "This is all you have after 30 years in the Senate?"
It's difficult for an outsider to assess whether Mr. Bevin warrants so much of Mr. McConnell's time and money. He says 22,000 people have contributed to his campaign, although only about 10 showed up at an event at a Mexican restaurant on Thursday evening.
The received wisdom in Washington is that the old guard has the upper hand. Mr. Boehner and Mr. McConnell defied the Tea Party wings of their caucuses last month and worked with Democrats to raise the statutory debt limit, putting an end to a painful era of fiscal brinksmanship that damaged the Republican Party's standing with the general public.
Mr. Bevin and others now are using the debt-ceiling vote to rally votes and money, accusing Mr. McConnell and Mr. Boehner of giving Mr. Obama a "blank check."
At the annual Conservative Political Action Conference this week in suburban Washington it was not the party's old hands but the policy purists such as Ted Cruz of Texas and Rand Paul, the junior senator from Kentucky and another Tea Party favourite, who placed at the top of a straw poll of party faithful. Mr. McConnell received only a lukewarm reception from the Republican activists at the conference, according to the Hill newspaper.
Whether that will translate into votes for Tea Party challengers like Mr. Bevin is not clear. It was unusually cold and snowy in Kentucky last week and the primary isn't until May. Still, there is little evidence of a groundswell of support. Despite his standing as a Tea Party rebel, Mr. Paul is sticking with the custom and has endorsed his fellow sitting senator, Mr. McConnell.
When Mr. Bevin is asked why his candidacy should be taken seriously, he points to the two young women with digital cameras at the back of the room, 'trackers' paid by groups affiliated with Mr. McConnell and Democratic candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes. If Mr. Bevin is such a long shot, why are his opponents tracking his every move?
"The path [to victory] is getting wider every day," Mr. Bevin told a few dozen local Rotarians at a lunchtime event at a buffet-style steakhouse.
Mr. Bevin was politely received and a few Rotary Club members left with lawn signs and bumper stickers.
"I was impressed," said John Bill Keck, a silver-haired real estate developer who said the lunchtime event was his first exposure to Mr. Bevin. Mr. Keck said he agreed with Mr. Bevin's forceful call for limiting the terms of elected representatives. He sought out Mr. Bevin for a picture and left asking campaign staff where he could make a donation.

Full text:   Architect Arno Matis grew up in the Cambie Corners area and so his six-storey residential project there invokes its past and present
Vancouver-born architect Arno Matis has a lot invested in his newest project, a six-storey development of 78 residential units near Oakridge Mall called Aperture: Not only is it the result of an extensive neighbourhood review, recently approved by the Urban Design Panel, it's also the area where he grew up.
So it's with a certain pride of place that he describes the Cambie Corridor not only as Vancouver's next big experiment in densification, but also as "our great North-South boulevard, a gateway to downtown and one of the first things visitors see when they drive in from the airport."
Sadly, although the Cambie Corridor plan developed four years ago calls for a significant increase in density and is relatively daring from a planning point of view, like many of the much-hyped "Vancouverist" ideals, it falls short architecturally.
The typical built response to the plan to date has been predominantly brick façade with a "wedding cake" style pastiche of different layers and materials, and architectural styles referencing warehouses that might be more at home in the likes of, say, Yaletown.
While the Cambie Corridor area was farmland and forest a century ago, its built environment is firmly rooted in a postwar, blue collar neighbourhood aesthetic, with a plethora of single-family dwellings that housed many new immigrants to Canada, among them Mr. Matis's parents. Many of these mid-century homes have been replaced by nineties-era monster houses, but their modernist spirit - also evidenced in the international style of the area's public buildings, such as the TD Bank on the northwest corner of 41st and Cambie - live on in Aperture.
With ground already broken and the skeletal remains of five typical postwar stucco houses soon to give way to 74 mainly two- and three-bedroom apartments as well as four north-facing villas, the project invokes the area's past and present.
"I remember this area being really progressive architecturally," Mr. Matis recalls. "When Oakridge Mall first opened in the sixties, it was quite a modern experiment." Other of the era references include Langara College, and even nearby Queen Elizabeth Park with its Buckminster Fuller style arboretum.
While the eighties and nineties were not aesthetic highlights, as evidenced by many nearby suburban pastiche style condo developments, there are some encouraging signs - notably the King David High School by Acton Ostry across the street, that also successfully makes contemporary the mid-century grain of the area's best design.
At the Aperture sales centre next to the Saint Germain Chinese bakery in Oakridge Mall, buyers who fit the mark demographically - mainland Chinese and local empty-nesters downsizing from single-family homes often worth 10 times their original purchase value - crowd around an impressive model. Aperture, developed by William Wong's Buffalo Investments, promises a Le Corbusier-inspired design for a new neighbourhood vision.
Its palette of white concrete, glass and wood give it a West-Coast-Bauhaus-meets-Southeast-Asia feel and will offer relief from the area's winter skies that the grey concrete, which darkens in the rain, cannot. Instead of ripolin - the last century's ground breaking white enamel paint so loved by Le Corbusier - Matis has employed a high tech and eco-friendly wood veneered glass panel that is distinctive to Western Canada.
The city has plans to further engage the south side of the project, on 41st Avenue, as a pedestrian- and cycle-friendly place with an extended and lushly landscaped sidewalk and separated bike lane; the four villas will animate the north facing lane way. An inner courtyard will feature an Asian inspired waterfall set within bamboo and grass planted gardens.
But what really makes Aperture so striking - and what ultimately convinced both city planners and development-wary neighbourhood groups - is the way it breaks up form, scale and massing to better integrate into the surrounding urban grain. While many new developments in the area appear as massive and abrupt interruptions to the single-family landscape, Matis has designed Aperture as a less invasive new neighbour.
The four villas designed as modernist courtyard houses with flat, seeded green roofs, have the same front-door entrances, detached exteriors and residential scale of their surrounding mid-century cousins.
And an inventive approach to the exteriors of the apartments with differently sized and laid out wrap around balconies and windows belies their almost identical interior layouts and square footage.
At the east and west ends of the rectangular project that spans an entire city block, Matis has designed a series of cantilevered window boxes that offer shading as well as sculptural forms. They create a vertiginous optical illusion that smooths the transition to the north and south facing units, referencing a certain seventies West Coast contemporary vernacular even as they propel Oakridge into a design conscious future.
Aperture's deep set floor plans suck in sunlight and the whole effect at night will read as a series of illuminated light boxes - a Westernmost beacon to the emerging Cambie Corridor.

Full text:   Bank of Montreal is allowing cash-strapped Western Canadian grain farmers to delay loan payments, joining a growing list of lenders responding to the transportation backlog that has left growers with full storage bins and shrinking bank accounts as planting season approaches.
The bank said on Thursday it is also offering flexible terms on the lines of credit that growers rely on to buy seed and fertilizer for their fields.
"We want to provide immediate support to any grain producers and other related businesses that may be experiencing cash flow disruptions as a result of the backlog, which can hamper their ability to finance crop expenses for the upcoming season," said Steve Murphy, BMO vice-president of commercial banking.
Farmer associations have been telling members to talk to their lenders about extending lines of credit or delaying payments. Crown lender Farm Credit Canada and the Department of Agriculture began offering loan extensions and cash advances of as much as $400,000, respectively, in February, which is when the bulk of agriculture loans are due.
The record 2013 harvest of wheat, corn and canola has strained the transportation system and sparked a war of words between the agriculture sector, politicians and the railways.
Railways blame the harsh winter and massive amount of grain for the delays in getting the crop to ports and buyers in the United States. But growers and the companies that buy and ship their crops say the poor service preceded winter, and that railway cuts and competition for locomotives and train crews from the oil sector are compounding the backlog.
Farmers get paid when the local elevator buys their grain. But the elevators, which are owned by such companies as Cargill and Viterra, are not buying. They are full and say they cannot get ample train service to the West Coast ports.
So about 5.5 million tonnes of grain - 60,000 rail cars - is sitting in bins and storage bags. And dozens of ships are at anchor of the B.C. coast awaiting grain.
Farmers complain they have not been able to capitalize on a crop that is 40 per cent bigger in a time of relatively strong prices.
Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall took his fight for better rail service to Ottawa last week, asking Ottawa to "take whatever steps they need to take" and warning that major food processors such as General Mills are running low on ingredients such as oats.
Federal agriculture minister Gerry Ritz, a former farmer, has threatened railways Canadian National and Canadian Pacific with legislation to eliminate the backlog.
"They are a service industry that does not care much about service," Mr. Ritz told CBC last week.
Alberta Premier Alison Redford has called on Ottawa to hold the railways financially accountable.
CP placed an ad in the Globe and Mail on Thursday in which chief executive Hunter Harrison conceded his company's service was falling short. But he noted there were 49 prairie winter days with temperatures of at least -25 C, a number he called the "tipping point" for railway operations. In extreme cold, railways run shorter trains to improve stopping distance. Switches and machinery are more prone to failures in extremely cold and snowy conditions.
"CP is moving more grain than ever in its history," said the ad. "This crop year CP has moved more grain than the previous year, itself a record for grain movements in Canada. In February alone, despite the weather, we managed a 15-per-cent increase in grain shipments."
It costs about $200,000 to plant and fertilize a typical prairie farm of 1,300 acres. This is money the growers won't get back until they harvest and sell the crop, which usually happens throughout the fall and early winter. Not this year.
Doug Chorney of Manitoba's Keystone Agricultural Producers estimates about half of that province's crop is in bins, at risk of spoiling due to weather and pests.
Total liabilities of Canadian farms grew by 21 per cent to $67.3-billion between 2008 and 2012, Statistics Canada said. The asset value of these farms grew by 33 per cent during the same period, driven largely by gains in real estate prices.

Full text:   Toronto Real Estate Board says prices and sales are up and improvement in listings will cultivate a seller's market
REAL ESTATE REPORTER
Sales of existing homes in the Greater Toronto Area nudged up 2.1 per cent in February compared with a year earlier, while prices continued to climb.
The latest data from the country's most populous city, as well as other urban centres such as Calgary and Vancouver, suggest Canadian home sales fared better than some experts thought they would in February, and prices maintained their sturdy upward trajectory.
The average selling price on Toronto's Multiple Listing Service last month was $553,193 - an increase of 8.6 per cent from a year earlier - the local real estate board said on Wednesday. The MLS Home Price Index, which seeks to create a more apples-to-apples comparison of prices over time by accounting for changes in the type and location of homes that are selling, was up 7.3 per cent.
"While the strong price growth experienced over the past year should prompt an improvement in the supply of listings, sellers' market conditions will continue to prevail this year," Jason Mercer, senior manager of market analysis at the Toronto Real Estate Board, said in a press release.
Canadian home prices are being watched closely, amid concerns that they are overvalued. In an interview this week, Ed Devlin, the head of Canadian portfolio management at bond giant Pimco, said he expects to see prices start to dip later this year and then fall by 10 to 20 per cent in real terms over the next three to five years. He expects that mortgage rates will rise this year, and will be one of the catalysts for softer prices.
Deutsche Bank said in December that it thinks Canadian home prices are 60 per cent too high, and declared that it believes Canada is the most overvalued housing market in the world. Other observers, including Canadian bank economists and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, see a much smaller degree of overvaluation but nonetheless agree that prices are too high.
In recent years, Finance Minister Jim Flaherty has been trying to take some steam out of the market to reduce the growth of house prices as well as the amount of mortgage debt that consumers are racking up. His actions precipitated a steep slump in house sales that began in the summer of 2012 and lasted through the spring of 2013. But the slump did not appear to have a major impact on prices.
Vancouver, the city that was hardest hit by the sales downturn and the least affordable market in the country, is now seeing record average selling prices for detached houses. On Tuesday, the city's real estate board said the benchmark price for all types of residential properties rose 3.2 per cent from a year earlier, to $609,100 in February, as sales increased by 40.8 per cent.
Calgary's real estate board said on Monday that the benchmark price of a single-family house was $482,800, up 9.1 per cent from a year earlier. Overall sales in the city rose 8.7 per cent from February 2013, and according to Bank of Montreal economists overall median prices in Calgary were up 7.6 per cent.
"Consumers who are in the market for single family homes priced below $300,000 do not have many options, and when product does become available, it typically does not stay on the market for long," Bill Kirk, the president of the Calgary Real Estate Board, stated in a press release.
The full national picture for February won't be available until the Canadian Real Estate Board releases data later this month, but Bank of Montreal economist Sal Guatieri suggested in a research note that he thinks February's market shows some momentum.
"February existing home sales in several major cities suggest the market is warming up after cooling a bit recently," he wrote. But Mr. Guatieri added in a note on Wednesday that home buyers "have yet to face the test of a meaningful climb in interest rates."

rcarrick@globeandmail.com
Someone ought to explain the facts of life to the nation's bankers.
They're handing out mortgages to people without any apparent understanding that today's home-buying couple is tomorrow's family of three or four. A lot happens to one's ability to afford mortgage payments when kids come along, but you'd never know it by the way lenders qualify borrowers.
Never take a lender's word that you can afford a house. Instead, try a new tool I've created called the Real Life Ratio (Use this worksheet or download our interactive calculator at tgam.ca/ratio). It's designed to show how well you'll be able to handle the basic monthly costs of home ownership, plus real life expenses such as cars, daycare and long-term home maintenance. Prospective home buyers should try it, and so should existing homeowners who want to see how well they're handling their finances.
The Real Life Ratio is an expansion of a simple affordability measure I introduced last year called the Total Debt Service and Savings Ratio, or TDSS (read about it online at tgam.ca/DqFS). The idea of creating something more comprehensive came to me after a Globe and Mail series on daycare was published last fall. We heard from many people about how hard it was to manage the cost of a mortgage in today's expensive housing market, on top of daycare and other costs.
Use the Real Life Ratio and you'll know what you're getting into before you buy a house. You may decide you need to save a bigger down payment, buy a smaller house, live in a cheaper location or not buy at all.
Here are a few important things to know about the ratio:
1. Household take-home pay is used here: Other ratios use gross income, which is less relevant for practical financial planning.
2. This is not a budget: Only fixed costs are included here; food, clothing and other costs aren't discretionary, but you decide how much to spend.
3. Costs for home maintenance and improvement are included: You won't face these costs every year, but on a long-term basis they might average about 1 per cent of your home's value annually, maybe less for brand new homes and more for older ones.
4. There's a slot to include condo fees: Be sure to add any monthly utility costs that are not included in your condo fees.
5. Your local real estate market plays a big role: A liveable Real Life Ratio may be harder to achieve in big cities with roaring real estate markets.
Guidelines on how to interpret the ratio are provided. For optimum results, make a list of your monthly spending on food, transportation, entertainment and everything else not included in the ratio. Then, see whether your lifestyle is affordable. If your Real Life Ratio is 80, could you get by on 20 per cent of your take-home pay?
Keep in mind that your ratio will change - for the worse if you have kids in daycare and have a couple of cars, and for the better once your kids are out of daycare and you move into your prime earning years.
To ensure the Real Life Ratio reflects real life, I consulted four financial planners. Thanks to Rona Birenbaum, Barbara Garbens, Kurt Rosentreter and Renee Verret for some useful suggestions based in part on spending patterns of their own clients.

IS YOUR BUDGET REAL LIFE? OR IS IT JUST FANTASY
The Real Life Ratio
The Real Life Ratio shows home buyers how well they will be able to manage the fixed cost of owning a home, owning cars, paying daycare costs and keeping up their savings while having money left over to spend. Use this worksheet to look at different scenarios before you buy, or use it to look at how your finances might be affected if you had kids, bought a new car or increased your saving.

D: A rough average cross-Canada daycare cost for infants, toddlers and preschoolers is $725 a month, with Ontario and B.C. residents paying more and Quebeckers paying much less.
E: The more you cut back here, the more you'll need to save later in life.
F: Based on the idea that your total spending on things like new appliances, a new furnace, a new roof and other improvements will average out to 1 per cent of the value of your home per year over time.

WHAT IT MEANS $
Subtract your real life ratio from 100 and you'll have the percentage of your paycheque left over to pay for food, clothing, transportation, kids' activities, entertainment, travel, life and health insurance premiums, etc.

INTERPRETING YOUR REAL LIFE RATIO
Less than 75: You can do this
75-80: Proceed with caution
81-85: Go back and see where you can cut costs
More than 86: Financial stress overload

The problem with Pimco's home wrecking

Abstract: Pimco has caused plenty of disappointment for German parent Allianz. Operating profit at the insurer's asset-management arm, which is 80 per cent Pimco, fell nearly 25 per cent in the fourth quarter, as a growing number of Pimco investors cashed in their chips. Redemptions for Pimco's Total Return Fund in February alone amounted to a net $1.6-billion (U.S.) - and that was the lowest in 10 months.

Full text:   To hear some influential international investors tell it, Canada's housing market is headed for a deep freeze that could make the current winter from hell seem positively mild by comparison.
Increasingly bearish analysts have been warning for several years that an overheated real-estate market is overdue for a cooling of some sort, ranging from a modest correction to an outright crash.
The latest Canadian home wrecker to weigh in is Pimco, the world's largest bond player. Ed Devlin, who oversees Pimco's investments in the Great White North, sees the slide beginning this year, in the face of increased bank funding costs, tighter credit and slightly higher mortgage rates.
The reasoning seems sound, although they're not offering any new evidence. But going by Pimco's recent track record, it's not something I would take to the bank.
"The interesting point is that we see a correction starting in the second half of this year, but we don't see it being disorderly," Mr. Devlin tells my colleague, Tara Perkins. "Just like any market, when it gets to the end of a bull market ... people are going to be less confident buying at these prices and more extended [valuations] and higher mortgage rates. And then we should start to see both volumes go lower, as well as prices."
His prediction of a gradual decline of 10 to 20 per cent in real terms over the next three to five years - and flat to 10 per cent lower in nominal terms (which is actually quite benign) - fits in the modestly bearish camp occupied by many Canada watchers these days. Just last week, Dr. Doom himself, Nouriel Roubini, told a Toronto audience that housing has "signs of frothiness, if not an outright bubble." But he stopped short of forecasting a Canadian crash, settling for a "meaningful correction."
That's the same neighbourhood occupied by the likes of Goldman Sachs, the IMF and a slew of other crystal-ball gazers. Of course, one person's "meaningful correction" can be another's crash. David Madani of Capital Economics has been warning since 2011 that Canada is headed for a prolonged and painful housing slump that will see prices drop 25 per cent over the next few years.
Unlike some other prognosticators, Pimco acts on its assessments. The firm's flagship $237-billion (U.S.) Total Return Fund, managed by company founder Bill Gross, slashed its Canadian debt exposure in the third quarter last year to 2 per cent of its vast portfolio from nearly 4 per cent a year earlier.
At times like this, I hesitate to point to Pimco's less-than-stellar forecasting record of recent years, which has contributed to its waning hold on its customer base. But the plain fact is that Pimco has missed enough waves to consider getting off the surfboard at times.
One costly miscalculation last year involved the timing and market effect of the U.S. Federal Reserve's tapering strategy, which led to a bad bet on the direction of U.S. Treasuries. Brazilian local-currency bonds, once a stellar performer for the Total Return Fund, turned sour last year, costing the fund a bundle.
Pimco has caused plenty of disappointment for German parent Allianz. Operating profit at the insurer's asset-management arm, which is 80 per cent Pimco, fell nearly 25 per cent in the fourth quarter, as a growing number of Pimco investors cashed in their chips. Redemptions for Pimco's Total Return Fund in February alone amounted to a net $1.6-billion (U.S.) - and that was the lowest in 10 months.

Abstract: A few minutes later, Mr. [Morton Lewis] encountered Karen Cassidy on the road and allegedly attacked her, ramming her vehicle, running her off the road then getting out and smashing her car window. He then apparently climbed in her car and tried to choke her. At one point, her father told The Napanee Guide, Ms. Cassidy said 'Don't kill me, I have children.' Mr. Lewis allegedly replied, "So do I and I've already killed somebody."

Full text:   The family that found a crazed, bloodied man announcing a murder on their doorstep is now preparing that same man's funeral, just one of the many ripples that ran through the tiny Ontario community of Tamworth in the aftermath of a rampage that left two dead and two injured.
At the Hannah funeral home, Brenda Hannah said she had spoken to the executor of Morton Lewis's estate about the arrangements for Mr. Lewis's burial. She has not yet heard anything about a funeral for Charles MacLeod Thomas, known in the community as MacLeod.
"We will be looking after Mr. Lewis's arrangements. I don't know about the other fellow. We haven't received a call about him," Ms. Hannah said.
On Wednesday afternoon, Ms. Hannah was sitting in the office when a red pickup truck pulled up outside. Mr. Lewis, a trapper and local handyman, came charging up to their screen door, pulling at the handle and trying to get in. He was shouting incoherently. Mr. Hannah's husband was about to let him in, until he noticed the blood on the man's face and sweater. Then Mr. Lewis said "MacLeod has been murdered," ran back to his truck and sped away, Ms. Hannah said.
A few minutes later, Mr. Lewis encountered Karen Cassidy on the road and allegedly attacked her, ramming her vehicle, running her off the road then getting out and smashing her car window. He then apparently climbed in her car and tried to choke her. At one point, her father told The Napanee Guide, Ms. Cassidy said 'Don't kill me, I have children.' Mr. Lewis allegedly replied, "So do I and I've already killed somebody."
Ms. Cassidy suffered a broken ankle and is awaiting surgery on the ankle at a Kingston hospital. She is currently on leave from her job as a public-school teacher in Deseronto. Her father said she was in good spirits Friday, despite the shock of what she'd been through.
"She's doing excellent," said her father, Ken Kilpatrick.
Local firefighter Chase Wayte, who was allegedly shot by Mr. Lewis outside the community's post office, is recovering well, according to his mother. She said he did not wish to speak to the media but that he was now out of hospital. Mr. Wayte was shot in the arm. It's not clear whether he was responding in his capacity as a firefighter or whether it was just a chance encounter with Mr. Lewis.
"My understanding was that he was shot while sitting in his truck in front of the post office," Ms. Hannah said.
Mr. Lewis apparently also threatened post-office employee Kate McDonald, pointing his gun at her but not firing.
Mr. Lewis, 59, was found dead inside his pickup shortly after. The province's Special Investigations Unit is investigating the circumstances of his death. The OPP said it was not a police shooting.
An acquaintance said that Mr. Lewis was in a dispute over trapping rights with Mr. Thomas, an eccentric man described as a hermit by locals. Mr. Thomas had been living in a barn ever since his home burned down a few years ago. Mr. Lewis trapped beaver and muskrat and fishers in the area, and had recently mentioned he was locked in a fight with a man who lived in a barn, the acquaintance said.
Everyone in town knew Mr. Lewis, a man who lived just west of Tamworth, a community of 500 north of Napanee. Robert Storring, a real estate agent, knew both Mr. Lewis and Mr. Thomas, the man he killed. Mr. Storring described Mr. Thomas as a recluse.
"He didn't like people very much. He would just as soon people leave him alone," he said. "He didn't socialize with a lot of people but he did with Morton Lewis."
Mr. Lewis was also a quiet man, Mr. Storring said.
"If he came in here and sat down and talked to us, you could talk to him. He spoke quietly ... but if you said the wrong thing, it was like you set him off. You could literally see him bristle. He was pretty short-fused, I think."
At the funeral home Ms. Hannah said she was feeling more settled Friday after her brush with danger but still couldn't explain the killing.
"Everybody's just baffled. Shocked. It doesn't make any sense," Ms. Hannah said.
"We've been in touch with lots of people in the community and everybody's sort of commiserating."
At the A-1 Corner Store, Terry Allison had served a steady stream of reporters from far and wide. "I'll be glad when the day is over," she said, "and things get back to normal. You don't expect this sort of stuff in this town. It's Tamworth. "

Full text:   A bungled launch and the tough turnaround ahead
RETAILING REPORTER
Rarely has a retailer raised consumer expectations so high and dashed them so quickly.
Target Corp. arrived in Canada a year ago amid buzz and anticipation that the U.S. discount chain, nicknamed Tar-zhay by some of its fashion-savvy fans, would wow shoppers with chic bargains.
Instead, Target stubbed its toe badly, unable to do the basics of replenishing its store shelves while taking criticism for charging noticeably higher prices than at its U.S. stores.
"It's a bit of the curse of high expectations," said Neil Stern, senior partner at retail consultancy McMillanDoolittle in Chicago. "There was so much buildup and drama around Target coming, and it would change the retail landscape. The disappointment was palpable."
The extent of the damage became clear this week when Target unveiled its grim 2013 results, which included a $941-million (U.S.) operating loss in Canada. It had originally forecast a profit here as early as the fourth quarter of 2013.
In 2014, it anticipates a Canadian loss of $314-million (before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization). The company says it is fixing its inventory snags, which are leading to empty shelves, and the situation already is improving.
Now comes the hard part: changing consumers' perception that Target Canada is Target Lite - or worse, that it's a buffed-up version of Zellers.
"Our goal was to bring the true U.S. Target experience to Canada, which included bringing the brands and products our guests [customers], who have cross-border shopped, know and love - and we have," Tony Fisher, president of Target Canada, said in an e-mail this week.
It's not enough for many shoppers, who say they find lower prices in U.S. stores than Canadian stores on identical items - or can't find the same products at all. The letdown has prompted some to continue to zip down to Targets south of the border, or just ditch the retailer altogether.
"They just don't have the variety of products here as in the States," said Sherri Redshaw of Stouffville, Ont., who has been shopping at Target for decades. She will head to Target during a business trip to Indianapolis next month to buy Hershey's cinnamon baking chips and the chain's "up & up" migraine medicine for her husband, among other products - merchandise she can't find at Target in Canada. "I never leave Target in the States without $300 of purchases."
Heather Arlen of Guelph, Ont., is in Florida right now, stocking up at Target on toys for her grandchildren and more than $50 worth of M & M's. The retailer south of the border carries seven varieties of the candy, for example, including coconut and peanut butter, while in Canada it has only two, plain and peanut, she said.
"Good grief, I can buy plain M & M's at the corner store. Why go to Target [in Canada]?"
Fashionistas also see a product gap. Sonia Basu, a graduate student in Kitchener, Ont., said she finds a wider selection of clothing styles at Target across the border, especially now that she's pregnant and looking for maternity and plus sizes. Target in Canada carries plus sizes, although they are not in a separate section but scattered throughout the apparel racks, and run to XXL rather than XXXL in the U.S., Target spokeswoman Lisa Gibson said.
Mr. Fisher said the perception that Target Canada is missing products is partly because of the troubled but improving supply chain, which has led to noticeable gaps on store shelves. "We remain fully committed to improving in-stocks and delivering a more consistent experience for our guests," he said.
As well, Target counts on its suppliers to recommend products that Canadian consumers prefer, Ms. Gibson said. "We will adjust our merchandising mix based on feedback we get."
Food and drug regulations mean that some U.S. products would have to be reformulated for Canada, which has stopped Target - and other retailers here - from carrying some items, she said. For instance, last year it could not bring its Archer Farms Sweet & Spicy Thai-Style Chile Reduced-Fat Kettle Chip here because the seasoning blend contained stevia, which could not be used to sweeten snack foods in Canada at the time. (Ottawa gave the green light to stevia in snack foods in January.)
Still, Target carries more than 90 per cent of the same in-house and designer apparel and home decor lines in its Canadian stores as it stocks in its U.S. outlets, including Nate Berkus homewares and Mossimo fashions, Ms. Gibson said.
But the retailer is at a disadvantage: Its Canadian stores are on average 18-per-cent smaller than those in the United States, forcing the retailer here to carry fewer offerings. Target bought the store leases from ailing Zellers in 2011 in a $1.8-billion deal; it hand-picked more than 120 of the best ones for Target, Mr. Fisher has said.
The Zellers deal allowed Target to do its Canadian expansion quickly - maybe too quickly. The retailer might have been better off with a slower approach.
Alex Arifuzzaman, a partner at InterStratics Consultants, a retail real estate advisory firm, characterizes Target's sites as ranging from "very good" to "average." He said Target is scheduled to open an "excellent" store soon in west-end Toronto that is being built to its specifications at about 140,000 square feet, close to the average size of its U.S. outlets.
The locations it picked up from Zellers "weren't ideal," he said. "But they were able to ramp up much faster" than they otherwise would have been if the company had bought store leases one by one. It poured about $10-million into renovating each store.
"I don't think the locations are the issue - it's what's in the box, I think, that is the issue in terms of Target's performance to date."
Target's first stores rolled out prematurely without the proper merchandise, he said. "You only have one chance to make a first impression and they failed to meet their U.S. experience in terms of both price and selection. ... Other retailers such as Canadian Tire do huge store launch events with deep discounts. Target did not. They had a high hurdle, no question. They did not clear it."
A survey done in late 2013 by brand consultancy Level5 found that only 24 per cent of consumers considered Target better than other general merchandise retailers such as Wal-Mart Canada Corp. and Canadian Tire Corp. Ltd., a stark drop from the 57 per cent just six months earlier. It left Target on par with troubled department store Sears Canada Inc., Level5 chief executive officer David Kincaid said.
Target has also suffered because consumers psychologically connect Target with Zellers - especially because the stores have a similar colour scheme. Zellers had emulated Target in its choice of red-and-white decor and some of its merchandise and store presentations, Mr. Kincaid said. "Consumers' emotional memories don't just shut off because you change the name of the store."
The firm's research last spring found that prices of a basket of household and food items were just 3 per cent cheaper in Target's U.S. stores compared with a comparable Target in Canada; when adjusted for foreign exchange rates, the U.S. prices were a mere 0.4 per cent cheaper.
Somehow, that hasn't improved the perception among customers that Canadian prices are out of line. Mr. Fisher has repeatedly said that prices here are comparable to those at low-cost Canadian rivals, and higher than those in the U.S. because of higher transportation, labour and other costs here.
In some categories, there are big price discrepancies. Research firm Gfk has found Target charged 31 per cent more on digital cameras and 11 per cent more on a home-theatre-in-a-box stereo at its Canadian stores.
Software engineer Nikolai Grigoriev said he headed to his nearby Target in Brossard, Que., last fall looking for a vacuum cleaner. He ended up buying something cheaper at Sears. If I am to go to a few local stores to find something inexpensive for my home, Target won't be among my destinations," he said.
Even so, Target wants to woo back shoppers such as Mr. Grigoriev. It has started to offer more deals, especially for everyday household and food items that tend to bring customers to stores more often.
"Selectively we're going to go out and be more aggressive," chief executive officer Gregg Steinhafel told analysts on Wednesday.
Most industry experts are betting Target will eventually get it right in Canada. Mr. Stern, the retail consultant, said other chains have stumbled and picked themselves back up. When consumers complained that Domino Pizza's product tasted like cardboard, Mr. Stern said, the company responded with a new recipe and marketing that essentially said: We know the pizza was terrible, here's the new stuff.
"At some point Target is going to have to do a Canada 2.0 and say, 'We're listening, we heard you, here are the things we've done to make those changes for you.'"
Gerald Storch, a former Target vice-chairman and former CEO of Toys "R" Us, said Target often has trouble entering new markets, even in the U.S. "At first , the consumer sees that beautiful store and assumes it's more expensive than it actually is. It just takes time. They need to improve their price perception and their in-stock position.
"It's a very large, well capitalized company. They should be able to fix it. ... Obviously they didn't expect to lose almost a billion dollars in one year. That's a major disappointment."

Abstract: I sat down and thought, 'If I go bankrupt, a lot of little guys are going to go broke because of me, because I was a smart ass.' Then I thought, 'what have I got going for me? I know how to log and I have an appraising ticket. You can't take that away from me. I have my motivation. I have my sons.' I realized that if I had all those things going for me, what the hell was I worried about?

Full text:   Rudy Nielsen made millions in property, lost it all, and made it all back and more
kgold@globeandmail.com
His desk has a large gleaming knife sticking into it at the corner, dramatically, as if someone got angry and left it there as a threat. On the floor is cowhide and on the wood-panelled walls, there are mementos such as snowshoes, antlers, and pictures of John Wayne.
Rudy Nielsen's large New Westminster offices feel more like the set of a western than B.C.'s largest provider of real estate data.
Anyone who keeps up on real estate will know his company's name. Landcor Data Corp. regularly makes the business and real estate pages for its comprehensive reports on all things to do with B.C. property. And we are a province that is obsessed with property - what it's worth, what it will be worth, and who's buying it.
In B.C., the impact of property development, in terms of gross domestic product, is around $8.2-billion, followed by the natural gas industry at $7.8-billion, and tourism at $7.4-billion. The film and television industry is way down the list at around $1.4-billion, according to figures supplied by the Urban Development Institute last year.
Property is big business in B.C., but anyone who lives here already knows that.
The man behind Landcor has been playing the B.C. property game his entire life, as a logger, a renovator, a flipper, an appraiser, an agent, an agency owner, a cattle rancher, a landowner, and now as a real estate analyst. This year, he celebrates the 50th year since he became an agent, although he gave up his licence in the eighties, when he decided to become B.C.'s biggest private property owner instead.
Lately, he's been shifting gears, selling off acres of properties owned by his Niho Land & Cattle Co., as demand grows for real estate analysis. He once owned 450 properties, and he's now down to around 200, all of it cattle, fishing or farmland, or "anything without a house on it." And he still owns LandQuest, a real estate company that has 24 agents around the province, specializing in rural properties.
With access to B.C. Assessment records, and in partnership with mapping and demographic companies, Mr. Nielsen provides automatic valuations, monthly assessments and detailed breakdowns on 1.7 million properties in B.C. His database holds B.C. sales going back to 1972. His long list of clients includes mortgage lenders, banks, municipalities, developers, utilities, insurance companies, and private homeowners.
In his boardroom, Mr. Nielsen shows me a fascinating, although anonymous graph of the loan-to-value ratios for all mortgage lenders - in other words, the amount of the loan compared with the actual value of the property. A bank commissioned the report.
One lender soars above all others. "If the market went down 10 per cent, they would be underwater," says Mr. Nielsen.
Landcor also supplies a steady stream of media-friendly data. It determined that 74 per cent of luxury homes in Vancouver had been purchased by Chinese buyers in 2010, at a time when there had only been speculation.
But that's only half the picture.
Mr. Nielsen's life experience offers perhaps the best real estate lesson of all, particularly the story of how he went from a poor kid with nothing, to a man worth $7-million who got cocky and ended up on the hook to creditors for $1.8-million.
He recalls going to court in 1981 and trying to convince the judge he only had $45 to his name because nobody would believe he had nothing left.
"At first, I used to tell everybody that the recession got me, but to tell you the truth, it wasn't the recession," Mr. Nielsen says. "I could have survived it, I had so much land. The reason was that I was a smart ass. I made so much money I thought I was indestructible.
"The desk I have right now cost $180. In those days, I had a $10,000 desk. I couldn't spend money fast enough."
Incredibly, over an eight-year span, Mr. Nielsen dug himself out of that hole. In the first four years, he paid off his creditors, and went on to build a real estate empire even bigger the second time around. But the pain of his humiliating fall taught him an economic lesson. "Today, I don't have any debt," he says. "I own everything clear title."
Debt, especially in a volatile market, is a ticket to disaster, he says. The less debt you carry, the safer you are in any market. When the economy starts to look dire, he sells off properties.
But to get to that realization, he needed to climb a mountain first, and he means literally. As his world collapsed, he took a break and got into his beat up car with his dog, a fishing rod and a rifle, and drove far north. He and his dog hiked into the forest, built a lean-to, and lived off trout and grouse for 10 days, until he figured out a solution. The solution turned out to be a new mindset.
"I sat down and thought, 'If I go bankrupt, a lot of little guys are going to go broke because of me, because I was a smart ass.' Then I thought, 'what have I got going for me? I know how to log and I have an appraising ticket. You can't take that away from me. I have my motivation. I have my sons.' I realized that if I had all those things going for me, what the hell was I worried about? I walked out of those mountains, made a deal with my creditors, and I started doing appraisals."
He did appraisals for the bank for $20 apiece, five a day. He did $4,500 worth of appraisals for construction mogul Ben Ginter, whom he'd met in Prince George. Like Mr. Ginter, Mr. Nielsen had grown his early fortune in Prince George. He worked in his 20s as a real estate agent, selling off vacant lots. The emergence of pulp mills in the area made for a booming market, which helped him get his start. Mr. Ginter, well known to British Columbians for his famous Uncle Ben's beer, had made a fortune and lost it by 1976. Mr. Nielsen sent him a few notices for payment, but knowing Uncle Ben was in financial trouble, he decided to forgive the debt.
When Mr. Ginter recovered from his financial setback, he called Mr. Nielsen and offered to help him put together a deal with a Canadian insurance company that wanted to purchase great swaths of timber properties in B.C. Mr. Nielsen appraised 220 properties, put in an offer and closed the deal on behalf of the company. He netted a commission of $480,000, which was a lot back in 1982. For his part, Mr. Ginter declined a cut of the profits. Mr. Nielsen used the money to help pay down his $1.8-million debt, but he still had a way to go.
In his life before he went broke, he bought residential and commercial real estate, but the second time around, he gave that up. He understood horses, bears, fishing, and living off the land, so he stuck to what he knew. Because he had nothing, he went back to his first job, as a logger. He found a chunk of land near the town of Vanderhoof that was for sale for $45,000. He drove up and checked out the property and immediately saw the amount of valuable timber that was there.
He paid $500 as a down payment, which was all the money he had. He then approached the local sawmill and said: "I'll lay my cards on the table. I only have $50 left in my pocket, and I need that to get back to Vancouver. I need $45,000 for this property. How about I log the property and give you the timber?" The log broker thought about it overnight, and the next day he gave Mr. Nielsen a cheque for $50,000, for the property and extra for expenses. He didn't even ask for an agreement.
"He said, 'you didn't declare bankruptcy. You've almost paid back $1.8-million. That's good enough for me.'"
Mr. Nielsen made a net profit of $225,000 selectively logging the land.
Between 1989 and 1999, he did 700 property deals throughout B.C., travelling from Yukon, Alaska and Alberta's borders, to Vancouver Island and the Lower Mainland. He officially launched Landcor in 2000, devising an automated valuation model, or AVM, with a team of programmers.
In B.C., he says, our best year for residential sales was 2007, with $64-billion worth of sales. For the last three years, we've been doing about $45-billion in sales.
A key player in the future of Lower Mainland real estate will be rapid transit, and where it's located, he says. Landcor recently figured out a calculation to determine the "sweet spot" around a rapid transit station where property values start to rise. It's part of larger report on transit, and it's only one of many the company churns out.
"I don't have to work, but I don't know what else I would do," he says. "I have a gorgeous wife, the perfect marriage. When I get up in the morning, I plan my whole day in the shower. If I have problems, I think them through in the shower, and I don't get out until they're solved. I have a daily goal, a weekly goal, a monthly goal and an annual goal. If I reach my goal, I reward myself.
"If I don't reach my goal and I get depressed, I reward myself, too."

Ira Jelinek, Harvey Kalles Real Estate Ltd.
The Action: The first time this one-bedroom plus den suite was listed, there were no bites. Yet when it was reposted at the same price late last year, there were nearly two dozen requests for showings immediately and the new owner bought the unit and its furnishings.
What They Got: Local developer Peter Freed and international designer Philippe Starck collaborated in the creation of a mid-rise with ultra-modern suites, like this third floor unit with oak hardwood floors, sliding bedroom doors and a Scavolini kitchen with Caesarstone and stainless steel finishes.
* The layout is open concept with the living and dining area situated along a wall of west-facing windows and terrace doors.
* Supporting elements consist of a four-piece bathroom and ensuite laundry facilities, as well as a locker and parking.
* Monthly fees of $368 covers the cost of water and heating, concierge and security, plus an outdoor pool.
The Agent's Take: "It was a cool loft in a very cool area in a building designed by Philippe Starck," says agent Ira Jelinek. "It was really cool and funky inside with exposed concrete ceilings, modern furniture, white lacquer kitchen and stainless steel appliances."
But a major highlight was outdoors. "I liked it because it faced west and for this building, facing west you have these really big patios with barbecues, so you could have seven people out there comfortably," Mr. Jelinek adds.

Full text:   Higher mortgage rates, weather and rising supply blamed for slowdown, while prices remain 20 per cent below 2006 peak
The long recovery in the U.S. housing market is at a new turning point as torrid gains in home prices start to give way to more tepid increases.
The sector raced ahead in 2013, driven by rock-bottom interest rates, pent-up demand and a tight supply of homes for sale.
Housing prices nationwide rose 11.3 per cent last year, the best annual result since 2005, according to closely-watched figures released Tuesday by S & P Dow Jones Indices. An index tracking prices in 20 major cities jumped 13.4 per cent in 2013.
Yet, signs abound that such a performance will be difficult to repeat. Mortgage rates, while still low, have begun to rise. Cold weather has battered many parts of the country, depressing sales and construction. And demand from institutional investors, who flocked to the housing sector to snap up bargains, is slackening.
"The strongest part of the recovery in home values may be over," said David Blitzer of S & P Dow Jones Indices in a statement Tuesday. In recent months, the data has begun to "exhibit some softness and loss of momentum," he said, adding that the rates of growth in prices have eased slightly.
The fact that the U.S. housing market is set to decelerate from a sprint to a saunter is not necessarily bad news. Some experts worried that the rapid pace of price increases, if maintained, would catapult the sector back into bubble territory. Over all, U.S. housing prices remain roughly 20 per cent below the peak they touched in 2006.
Double-digit percentage increases in prices like the kind witnessed last year are "not sustainable," said Paul Diggle, a real estate economist at Capital Economics. A slower rate of growth would be "quite a welcome change."
A rising supply of homes will rein in the housing recovery, said Mr. Diggle. The market's recent performance is attracting would-be sellers who were previously unwilling or unable to put their properties up for sale. Developers have also kicked off of wave of new construction.
The past year was a highly profitable one for developers. On Tuesday, home builder Toll Brothers Inc. reported that profit for its first quarter ending Jan. 31 increased more than tenfold from the same period a year earlier.
For builders, the trick is to seize today's opportunities without repeating yesterday's mistakes. "We must always be assessing what's the demand and how much we should build to that demand," said Jorge Perez, chief executive of Related Group, a major developer based in Florida. His company has incorporated new safeguards against speculative behaviour, for instance by requiring hefty deposits from buyers of its condominiums. "Our projects are still doing very, very well," he said.
Two of the factors that sent prices rocketing higher last year - buying by investors and ultra-low mortgage rates - are less powerful now. The interest rate on a fixed-rate 30-year mortgage has increased by a full percentage point over the past year to 4.4 per cent, as the U.S. Federal Reserve opened the door to tapering its bond purchases.
Activity by investors, who snapped up properties in search of future profits, has also eased. Now "we're starting to shift toward a [housing] recovery that will have to depend more on job growth and income growth - and that will change the rate of price increase," said Jed Kolko, an economist at Trulia.com.
Moderate increases in home prices, however, are unlikely to rekindle the American love affair with home ownership - a relationship that some fear was irreparably damaged by the housing crash. Robert Shiller, the Nobel Prize-winning economist who helped construct the S & P Dow Jones housing indexes, said Tuesday that Americans' expectations of future home-price appreciation have dropped dramatically.
"We're just losing our general sense of optimism about housing," he said on a conference call. "It's just slowly percolating through the population." Mr. Shiller said he expects home prices to increase roughly 5 per cent in 2014, or about half of their 2013 gains. But he also worries about a more negative scenario, where a lack of demand might actually cause prices to fall.
That worry is echoed in places such as Phoenix, which epitomized the boom-and-bust housing cycle. "We have been through enormous turbulence since 2002 and it will be a relief for many to be operating in a more balanced market," wrote Michael Orr, who heads the Center for Real Estate Theory and Practice at Arizona State University, in a recent report on the local property outlook. But if the market cools too much over the course of 2014, he added, prices could once again turn downward.

Leave the city and upsize in Niagara region

Author: Israelson, David

Abstract: "We moved here in 1994," Mr. [Steve Goldberger] says. "We used to come here a couple of times a year. My wife and I came here for a weekend to see some theatre and she said, 'I could live here.' So I said, 'Why don't we?' and six weeks later we bought a place."

Full text:   Influx of active 'near seniors' looking for a slower pace have pushed up prices - but not to Greater Toronto Area levels
On weekends when Steve Goldberger takes the stage with one of his bands at a popular bar at the edge of this scenic town, he doesn't look back.
"We moved here in 1994," Mr. Goldberger says. "We used to come here a couple of times a year. My wife and I came here for a weekend to see some theatre and she said, 'I could live here.' So I said, 'Why don't we?' and six weeks later we bought a place."
Today Mr. Goldberger, 59, has the best of both worlds. He still maintains a home in Toronto where he's part of the music scene as a bass guitar player, singer and producer, and he still works part-time in the big city in his family's property management business.
But for at least half of each week, often more, Mr. Goldberger's life is in Niagara-on-the-Lake as a local musician of some renown. His country and western band, the Old Winos, plays every Friday night, and his bluesy Niagara Rhythm Section plays the same venue on Saturdays.
Mr. Goldberger is part of a fast-growing trend within an already growing demographic - call them the not-quite-retired-but-getting-ready generation. These are active baby boomers who for either financial or lifestyle reasons continue to work, but want change.
"We have a lot of people like this here now," says Thomas Elltoft, a local real estate agent.
"One thing we've noticed is that the demographic has dropped in age - our customers tend to be 35 to 55 instead of over 65, which is who we saw more when I got started."
The 431,000-strong Niagara Region, including St. Catharines, still has the second-highest proportion of seniors in Ontario (just behind Peterborough) - 19.2 per cent according to the 2011 census. It's among the most senior-heavy populations in Canada, though some smaller centres such as Elliot Lake or Parksville, B.C., have larger proportions.
The region is changing, though, Mr. Elltoft says. Three years ago, one of Niagara-on-the-Lake's residential streets lined with stately Georgian homes had no children. "Now I counted nine," he says.
It's the active near-seniors who are making a difference all across Niagara, says Walter Sendzik, CEO of the Greater Niagara Chamber of Commerce. "We're seeing a lot of people coming from Toronto who are downsizing, people who are looking for a slower pace but close to the Greater Toronto Area. You can sell a home in Toronto for $700,000 and get a property [in some parts of Niagara] for $300,000. It's downsizing from the city but it's upsizing in the rural area."
Newcomers to Niagara discover that while the pace is different, the region is hardly a bastion of white belts and blue rinse hair.
For entertainment, Niagara Falls, the heart of the region, with 81,000 people, is one of Canada's top tourist attractions; Niagara-on-the-Lake has high-end hotels and restaurants and the Shaw Theatre Festival and the region is also a centre for winemaking, with wineries hosting tastings, concerts and other events.
It isn't perfect, of course. Niagara-on-the-Lake, with 14,000 people, is crowded with tourists in summer, and skyrocketing rents on the town's main street mean that many service-type businesses have been replaced by higher-end tourist shops.
"There used to be more 'normal' stores that you could walk to," Mr. Goldberger says. Mr. Sendzik says that the lack of a cohesive public transit network is a chronic problem across the region; most families have trouble getting by without a car.
Real estate prices are rising in Niagara-on-the-Lake - Mr. Elltoft says there was a 10-per-cent jump last year - as well as in seemingly unlikely places such as Welland, where a sparkling new aquatic sports complex for rowing, canoeing and kayaking has been built for the 2015 Pan Am Games. But it's still hard for young people to find good jobs in many areas.
"We're seeing in-migration of older people settling down and out-migration of younger ones who can't find work," Mr. Sendzik says. "You can get a good entry or mid-range job in Niagara but once you hit a certain level you can be limited."
For a senior and near-senior population, health care in the region has been an issue, too. A new hospital has opened in St. Catharines, and earlier this month the Ontario government announced that it will replace an aging patchwork of medical facilities with a new hospital in Niagara, with the exact location still to be determined.
The region is close enough for people who have to get to work in Hamilton or the Greater Toronto Area to settle, and in any case, technology lets many people work without having to go to an office, Mr. Elltoft says. He adds that business travellers often use Buffalo International Airport, which is cheaper and closer than Toronto Pearson.
The best things, Mr. Goldberger says, are the intangibles.
"I would say that I have more friends and better friends here than I do in Toronto now," he says. And the first time I got stuck on a bridge [one of the drawbridges across the Welland Canal] I said to myself, 'Oh, I'm late.'
"Then I realized, I wasn't late for anything."

Full text:   Chemist, teacher, real estate agent, investor. Born on Feb. 19, 1918, in Hong Kong; died on Oct. 26, 2013, in Toronto, of old age, aged 95.
William Shau Piu Tsui was born in 1918, the Year of the Horse. He was the third of seven children born to Man Kit, who at 13 had emigrated from Guangdong to work as a labourer in the United States, "the golden mountain" to tens of thousands of impoverished Chinese in the twilight of the Ch'ing dynasty.
Young William attended the Jesuit-run Wah Yan College in Hong Kong, graduated from Pui Ching Middle School in 1936, and enrolled in the chemistry department in Zhejiang University in Hangzhou. When war with Japan broke out, he transferred to Sun Yat-sen University, which moved inland while the conflict raged.
In 1944, he married his university sweetheart, Hun Fan Song. After graduation he launched a chemical factory in northern Guangdong with two schoolmates, and by the early 1950s their products were being sold as far as Eastern Europe. Early on, however, the war intervened; in 1945, when Japanese warplanes attacked a compound where Fan had taken shelter, she had to run for her life carrying her one-month-old child, Laura, on her back, with William rushing from work to catch up.
His business success continued after the defeat of Japan, but only for a few years. After the creation of the People's Republic of China in 1949, William's political antenna saved the lives of his family. By now the sole owner of the factory, he went to the local cadre, gave the plant to the Communist party, and was allowed to remain as its manager. If he had waited another six months, the factory would have been nationalized and he and Fan would have been sent to forced labour camps as exploiters of the workers, and likely would have died there.
William's prescient move made it possible to eke out a living while tens of millions died from starvation, abuse and murder under chairman Mao Zedong. It was extremely difficult to leave China, but William planned carefully to extricate his family. In 1958, with son Ken safe with grandparents in Macao, William, Fan and Laura escaped to Hong Kong. There, William forged a new career, teaching high-school science and mathematics.
In 1965, the family immigrated to Toronto. William began yet another new life as an insurance agent, but switched to real estate. After learning the business with Mann & Martel and getting his real estate licence, he and Fan opened an office in old Chinatown, behind City Hall, the first Chinese-owned real estate operation in the city. Sand Real Estate served Toronto's Chinese community for more than 20 years.
Along the way, William also helped many friends from China move to Canada, and became honoured "uncle" to dozens of their children.
Like all Chinese of his generation, William lived through extraordinary turmoil, but his 47 years in Toronto were peaceful, marred only by the death of Fan in 2000. In his final years, he loved to read the local Chinese newspapers; a successful stock trader, he followed the markets closely, religiously charting trading activity of a few dozen carefully chosen energy stocks each week, and regularly issuing trading orders for Laura to execute on his behalf.
William was a man of immense determination, humanity, integrity, tolerance, good humour and wisdom. After 95 years of a remarkable life, he died after a short illness, early in the morning on Oct. 26.
James Hilborn is a friend of
William and his family.

Full text:   The end of a program of incentives for foreign investors will 'cut off 1,000 buyers at the high end' says one observer
kgold@globeandmail.com
The party might be over for Vancouver's high-end luxury housing market, according to an immigration lawyer who's studying the impact of Canada's investor program - and more importantly, what will happen now that it's been cancelled.
The millionaire visa program got kiboshed in budget cuts last week after it was deemed a lousy deal for Canada. The closure means no entry for about 45,000 applicants who were awaiting permanent residency, most of them from mainland China. Although the investor program was put on hold two years ago, the government had still been processing visas that were on backlog to the tune of 1,200 a year out of Hong Kong, says immigration lawyer Richard Kurland. But now, absolutely everything has come to a grinding halt, which is, he says, a game changer.
Cancelling the program has been a huge topic for the real estate industry over the last week, since so much of Vancouver's high-end property market on the city's west side and in West Vancouver has been fuelled by wealthy Chinese investors.
Mr. Kurland sounds positively tickled pink by the cancellation and foresees a wave of listings for high-end properties seeking buyers before the market drops.
"I've been waiting for this to happen," Mr. Kurland says. "I expect to see 'for sale' signs on expensive properties sprouting like mushrooms, once people figure out what it means to cut off 1,000 buyers at the high end."
He believes it has to hit the top end of the market hard because of the sheer numbers of foreign millionaire buyers who got stopped at the door.
"You've cut out a key demand source for high-end Vancouver real estate."
You'd be hard-pressed to find someone in the know who thinks the investor program was a good deal. The numbers say it all.
"I think that the program was horribly priced," says Tsur Somerville, professor at University of B.C.'s Sauder School of Business. "It's selling citizenship."
And look at the cost, he says. Investors had to put up an $800,000 loan to the government for five years, at zero interest. At 5 per cent, that amounts to a contribution of $200,000.
"These are people who are buying Maseratis for their kids. It's about the cost of one of those," says Mr. Somerville.
Why did the investor program continue for so long? It appears to be a case of short-term thinking. From the province's perspective, it's an estimated 1,000 people loaning the government $800,000 interest free, which is $800-million, says Mr. Somerville.
"If I'm the provincial government, that's great," he says. "But from the perspective of the economy and social dynamics, it's not without its costs. We're in a place where that is a concern, because [housing] increases demand for land, which is scarce in supply. And it's not giving us the benefits."
The cancellation has been largely misunderstood, says Mr. Kurland. Ending the program doesn't mean immigrants can no longer apply for residency. There is permanent residency available through the B.C. Nominee Program, for immigrants who are skilled workers, entrepreneurs, students, or business owners. And Quebec is still offering the millionaire investor program, which could remain a point of entry for cash flow.
"It's like you have a house with 45 windows and one got shut, and you claim you're suffocating," he says of the backlash.
This cancellation, he says, isn't about curtailing immigration, but putting an end to a bum deal for Canadians - and in Vancouver in particular, where the repercussions of an unaffordable market have been felt most. Consider that the average declared income in Metro Vancouver was only $41,176 according to Revenue Canada statistics from 2009. The average selling price of a detached house is more than $1-million. The market is clearly driven by outside forces that include foreign investment (investors from elsewhere in Canada have an effect too).
Mr. Kurland says another major game changer is the upcoming revision to the Canada-China tax treaty. Part of the update to that treaty may include easy access to information, such as property ownership records, in order to deter tax evasion.
"If the new tax treaty is going to be modelled after the others Canada has signed in the last few years, it will allow for specific information exchange between the two countries, like we do with the Americans.
"The ramifications are huge."
Mr. Kurland says another factor at play is that many of those houses in Vancouver's high-end market were purchased by non residents - wealthy buyers who were ill advised by overseas agents that if they bought a house, they'd fast track the visa process. It doesn't work that way, though, says Mr. Kurland. When those homeowners sell, they'll be facing non-resident withholding tax. Mr. Kurland says he has already asked the Canada Revenue Agency about the potential fallout of that scenario.
"Even when a report on a sold house is filed, it will take some time to open it and examine it and figure it out. Another half year goes by. But the owners are not in the country any more, so who's left holding the bag?" asks Mr. Kurland.
"I'm interested in the tax dollars that will go missing here. Who loses? The treasury. That's who is going to take the hit."
Mr. Kurland also questions the many holding companies that owned so many of the properties in Vancouver. Was anyone keeping track of ownership of those companies, and the taxes that could have been claimed if they changed ownership outside of Canada?
"Yes, it's a free market," Mr. Kurland says. "However, a free market includes taxation rules and regulations. That's built in. And those rules are there for a purpose - and not just to collect money. If you remove any impact of these tax regulations for overseas purchasers, you are making it more expensive for locals who abide by the tax laws and you're making it less expensive for overseas buyers who are able to evade or avoid our tax laws.
"In other words, the locals are at a disadvantage. It's as if we are offering subsidized property transactions to overseas buyers and sellers."
David Ley, University of B.C. geography professor and author of Millionaire Migrants , agrees that our lack of data on property ownership is to our detriment.
"There's such a failure in due diligence in our record keeping, we really have set ourselves up to be taken advantage of," Mr. Ley says. "This will be an interesting next few months."
Most predict a softening in the luxury market. Others believe there may be little fallout. Developer Will Lin doesn't think losing the investor program will affect property values in the immediate future because so there are still so many potential new buyers here.
"Maybe in the upper end niche market where millionaires go for house hunting, but even there, we aren't gong to see the immediate effect of that, because typically, there's a long process they go through," he says. "They land here, settle the kids into school and whatnot, then they usually stay with relatives for six months or buy an investor home that doesn't require a mortgage. And then in a year or two they eventually buy the big dream home. We won't see that change."
Thomas Fung, who owns Aberdeen Centre, said he foresees other avenues of cash flow coming into the city.
"It may slow down the inflow of capital or investment in the property market, but at the same time, I'm sure that those people have their ways to channel the funds from China. They have their way to do it."
Mr. Ley says there was a correction in the mid-90s when an exodus of Hong Kong residents left Vancouver and prices in Shaughnessy fell 26 per cent. As to whether the softening of the top end market will have a trickle down effect is a matter of debate. Some say overall population growth in the mid-range market is too big to be affected.
"But what you can never tell is the psychological affect of this," Mr. Ley says. "How deep will the fear be? That is the question. People who've been going with the flow may now get more fearful and withdraw investment. I think that is a possibility.
"And I am talking about foreign investment, because that's what drives the top-end market. Anyone who says otherwise is either misleading or mislead."
For his part, Mr. Kurland has been keeping his eye on the Multiple Listing Service since the program ended. While on the phone, he was busy counting the high-end houses on MLS that have come up on the Vancouver market.
"That's seven homes listed since the budget," he says.

The principals of TAS are so fond of the community surrounding its latest condominium in the Junction, they not only dine and shop there, but sourced everything they could from local talents and trades to build the infill development.
"I often say it's my favourite neighbourhood in the city because I find there's such diversity there," says president Mazyar Mortazavi, who is a regular patron of Gerhard, Mjolk and Playa Cabana Cantina.
"We're very big advocates of supporting local businesses, so it's not a marketing angle for us, it's just the way we live and breathe ourselves."
Mason Studio was among the first local team recruited to design the sales office and interiors of the modern, seven-storey development at the corner of Indian Grove and Dundas Street, just east of Keele Street.
"It's about creating an environment where if you're coming to the Junction for the first time, you'd really experience the breadth of the Junction: We used a local contractor and all the furniture and fixtures that we have in the space were designed by local designers and local artisans," says Mr. Mortazavi, who notes this is rarely done by builders.
"One of the key things that sets us apart from any other developer is that we treat our work from a community-first standpoint."
Not only have buyers found stylish pieces from Eclectic Revival and Flair Lighting at the sales office, but there is also the occasional event, such as free yoga sessions, to showcase independent operations around the site.
"We're close to 60-per-cent sold in three short months from the date we launched, so the response has been great," says Mr. Mortazavi. "And we gauge the success of the response not just from a sales standpoint, but also from the acceptance from the community."
Like the project's name, which combines the first letters of the major intersection nearby, the mid-rise will bring together many components, such as street-level retail, second floor fitness and party rooms and 85 suites, two townhouses and five two-storey live/work lofts with street access.
"The scale of it is in keeping with the area and the architecture is unique and responsive to the context and scale of the building," says Mr. Mortazavi. "Most of our units are one-offs, so it's effectively 90 custom homes."
To mirror the modern façade designed by Quadrangle Architects, the interiors will be contemporary, with open concept spaces, nine-foot ceilings, hardwood floors and Scavolini kitchens with stone counters and stainless steel appliances.
"The majority of our units are larger one-bedroom and dens and two-bedrooms, and our average unit size is about 750 square-feet, which is considerably larger than typical condominium products," says Mr. Mortazavi, who cites plans with up to three bedrooms and a den.
Residents will be connected with the outdoors with balconies and terraces, including some with garden planters for those facing south, as well as windows to the north and south for two-storey through units on the top floor.
The building will be built to LEED standards - with green roofs to in-suite energy recovery ventilators - keeping monthly fees to 45 cents per square feet.
Most suites will have an option to buy parking for $28,500. "A lot of people opted not to get parking because we're within walking distance to Bloor and Dundas subway station, Bloor and Keele subway station, and there are bus lines on Dundas and Keele," Mr. Mortazavi adds.
Occupancy is slated for November, 2015.

LISTING AGENT
Kara Reed, Chestnut Park Real Estate Ltd.
The Action: Even without private parking, this 967-square-foot bungalow had buyers lined up along the historic street during a weekend open house. Though there were semi-detached properties available for sale nearby, detached ones like this were not, so it racked up four offers.
What They Got: Across from Bruce Mackey Park off Queen Street, this Victorian residence has retained and restored original features circa 1880, from its brick façade, gabled roofline and stained glass windows outside to iron floor grates, wainscotting and hardwood floors inside.
* In the past two decades, a new roof, cedar deck, plumbing and cooling system were among practical improvements, while cosmetic ones include updated cabinetry and ceramic backsplashes in the kitchen and a second full bathroom, kitchen and carpeted recreation room in the one-bedroom basement suite, which has front and rear exits to the 26-by-102-foot lot.
* The layout is traditional with separate living and dining rooms, an office and two bedrooms on the main floor.
The Agent's Take: "It's a coveted little street that's tree-lined with a lot of Victorians and in the hub of prime Leslieville," says agent Kara Reed, who notes the proximity of Queen Street cafes, shops and steetcars.
"This is a detached home with 26-foot frontage, so it had a garden that was absolutely magical, you didn't even feel like you were in the city with flagstone patios, a pond, hundreds of perennials and big mature trees."
This property was also a local curiosity featured in books and walls of local businesses.
"It had it staged and painted ... but it was a true Victorian in beautiful shape," Ms. Reed said. "[Plus] what it did have that helped was a separate basement apartment ... to generate income."

Abstract: Ivanhoé Cambridge dabbled in one condo project in London, and "we're getting our money with a very nice profit, but then it needs to be reinvested," says Sylvain Fortier, executive vice president at Ivanhoé Cambridge. "And you're not going to find these opportunities all the time. So you almost need to factor in the time that the money is back in your bank account sitting at a zero return."

Ivanhoé Cambridge , the real estate arm of the Caisse de depôt et placement du Quebec, is dipping its toes in the Canadian condo business for the first time. And it's doing so in Quebec City, a condo market that economists already believe is oversupplied.
Ivanhoé Cambridge is partnering with the real estate division of Sobeys Inc. and some local investors to build a project that the group expects will ultimately include more than 400 rental units, 200 condominiums and more than 43,000 square feet of ground-floor retail and commercial space. The partners will make an initial investment of more than $50-million.
The decision to invest comes despite warnings from economists and real estate observers that Quebec City's condo market is showing signs of strain.
"Markets in Montreal, Quebec City and Ottawa have been flooded with an overhang of inventory of unsold condos," Toronto-Dominion Bank economist Diana Petramala stated in a recent research note.
She also noted that home prices in Quebec City, as well as in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver, look overvalued and "will likely feel the pinch from modestly higher interest rates over the next two years."
The Caisse de depôt has a mandate to grow the funds deposited by its clients, mainly Quebec-based public and private pension plans, while contributing to the province's economic development.
Ivanhoé Cambridge owns the Château Frontenac hotel in Quebec City, as well as some retail properties. It has historically concentrated on retail and office space, but has moved into residential properties in recent years. It now holds more than $2.5-billion of multiresidential buildings, making up more than 7 per cent of its portfolio.
The majority of the company's properties are in the United States. It has smaller but significant holdings in Britain and Canada, as well as some holdings in countries like China. It says it wants to focus on big cities: London, New York, Los Angeles.
But it has largely shied away from the condo business, preferring rental apartments. That's in large part because the returns from a condo development are made relatively quickly, in the few years it takes a project to be built, while pension plans tend to focus on long-term investments that can spin off steady profits for a decade or more.
Ivanhoé Cambridge dabbled in one condo project in London, and "we're getting our money with a very nice profit, but then it needs to be reinvested," says Sylvain Fortier, executive vice president at Ivanhoé Cambridge. "And you're not going to find these opportunities all the time. So you almost need to factor in the time that the money is back in your bank account sitting at a zero return."
When it comes to the Quebec City development, he said the appeal lies in its location close to Université Laval, shopping areas and Hopital Laval, as well as the fact that it's a mixed-use project that spans condos, rentals and retail.
"We like the price point we're shooting for - it won't be as luxurious or expensive as others," Mr. Fortier says.
Sales of existing homes were down 7.4 per cent in January from a year earlier in Quebec City, while the average sales price dropped 1.5 per cent.
Compared to other housing types in Quebec City, "the condo segment is showing the most stress," according to Ben Rabidoux, a housing analyst who heads his own research shop, North Cove Advisors.
The new project is "two, three years out - so like any development project you need to close your eyes a little bit and figure out where the market will be by the time you're open and ready. But again, I go back to location and overall demand," Mr. Fortier says.
Asked whether he would consider a condo project right now in Montreal, which is also on economists' watch list, Mr. Fortier replies: "No, that falls in the 'life's too short' bucket ... we'll stick to rentals."

Full text:   REAL ESTATE REPORTER
A man who makes a living helping the country's largest bank avoid risks is preparing to double down on a market that many people believe is on the verge of a nasty fall.
Babak Habibzadeh, a 29-year-old risk manager with Royal Bank of Canada, lives with his parents and bought his first condo two years ago. He rents it out and has been delighted with the returns to date.
So today he's buying another - a one-bedroom-plus-den, 601-square-foot unit on the 18th floor of a yet-to-be constructed building in Toronto called Core Condos that is scheduled to open in 2017. He's not yet sure if he will rent it out or live in it, but says it will be a sound investment either way.
"Are you excited?" the saleswoman asks him as he plows through a stack of paper in the sales office, outlining the $360,000-plus deal.
"In three years I will be," he says.
Toronto's condo boom has given investors plenty of reason to be excited over the past decade, with prices for new units soaring by more than 70 per cent, according to RealNet Canada Inc. But the recent news is not so encouraging: Sales volumes have declined for two years, a backlog of 18,000 unsold units hangs over the market, and price growth has flattened, even as new condo projects continue to pour onto the market.
The plethora of construction cranes that populate Toronto's skyline has made the city a prime exhibit for those who believe Canada's real estate market is in bubble territory and a crash is imminent. But on the other side of the debate are buyers like Mr. Habibzadeh and developers like CentreCourt Developments, the company behind Core Condos. They are betting their own money on the theory that the market is still far from saturation.
If they're wrong, the implications would extend far beyond Toronto. In December, the Bank of Canada singled out the market when outlining risks to the national economy and warned that "a sharp correction in the condominium market could spread to other segments of the housing market" with "significant repercussions on the real economy."
Finance Minister Jim Flaherty has warned for years of the dangers lurking in Toronto's condo boom. "I hear from some of them who are in the business of building condos that they don't really have a plan, they're just going to keep building them until people stop buying them," he told The Globe and Mail in April, 2012, two months before tightening mortgage rules to discourage real estate speculation. "It will lead to a crash."
But developers continue to see evidence that the supply of eager buyers is far from exhausted.
Andrew Hoffman, who launched CentreCourt in 2010, is confident he is providing housing the city needs. He points to growing numbers of young professionals who want to live downtown and the declining construction of houses and apartment buildings. "The question is, are we building more than the underlying demand requires? And I think the answer is no," he says.
In November, after securing a prime parcel of downtown land, he agreed to allow The Globe and Mail to sit in on development meetings for Core Condos. This is the inside story of how a condo is made. It is also a window on the economic forces driving one of the hottest segments of a national housing market that continues to defy expectations.
The money
The team at the top of CentreCourt is a blend of experience and youth. A lawyer by training, Mr. Hoffman spent 21 years at Menkes Developments Ltd., a prominent Toronto condo developer, where he rose to become chief operating officer before striking out on his own. His vice-president, Shamez Virani, is a 29-year-old who earned an MBA in real estate from Columbia Business School and did a stint at Goldman Sachs in investment banking before joining CentreCourt.
Core Condos is the duo's fourth project and, as with the previous developments, the two men began by searching for the right parcel of property. Location is key, but so is price because that determines both the cost of the condo units and the returns for the developers and their equity investors.
Mr. Hoffman and Mr. Virani checked out more than 50 properties before settling on a piece of land on Shuter Street, in the core of the city, close to the Eaton Centre and Ryerson University. It was owned by Bruce Feldman, a developer who has spent 28 years building shopping centres. Mr. Feldman bought the land in 2011, hoping to delve into condos for the first time, but ultimately decided he didn't want to do the project on his own. "It's just too complicated and you can make so many mistakes," he says.
Despite the apparent easy money to be made by developing condos in Toronto, many developers hit the market only to find out they can't sell enough units to get the bank financing they require to actually build. "Every year there have been guys who haven't been able to make money, because you really have to appeal to 100 or 200 or 300 individuals that want to own what you're building," says Michael Cooper, the chief executive officer of Dundee REIT and Dundee Real Estate Asset Management (DREAM), one of Canada's larger condo investors and developers.
It took Mr. Feldman roughly a year and a half to negotiate the city's rezoning process and win approval for a condo tower. He agreed to protect the heritage façade of townhouses that the city says are a rare example of Georgian styling, to replace rental units that were on the property, and to pay $1.6-million to the city for local improvements. Mr. Feldman also had to agree that his proposed building would have more than 80 parking spots - which meant taking on the expensive chore of digging down five levels to construct a parking garage.
The biggest single battle with the city was over height. "Our first proposal was for 33 storeys," Mr. Feldman recalls, adding that a city councillor "almost threw us out the door."
"They wanted to give us 21 floors, and I needed 24," Mr. Feldman says. He had determined that 24 was the magic number that would let him build enough units to achieve a solid return. "Just in case a mistake occurred or there were cost overruns or something, it gave a little bit of cushion and I needed that."
The city ultimately acquiesced, and by then Mr. Feldman was sure he wanted a partner to take the project to completion. Mr. Hoffman's CentreCourt agreed to buy the land, which is valued at more than $10-million, for the same price that Mr. Feldman paid, and to give him a portion of the development profits.
The moment the deal closed in November, the CentreCourt team sprinted into action. Mr. Hoffman was determined to plan the project, design the units and begin sales in just three months. He says taking too long reduces the annualized return for his investors, ultimately requiring him to charge condo buyers more.
In the condo business in Toronto, developers like Centre Court put up a small portion of the project's total cost, with a chunk of the rest coming from buyers who are willing to part with large deposits for condos that are still years away from becoming a reality.
In the case of the Core Condos project, total capital costs are expected to top $65-million. CentreCourt obtained $5.2-million of third-party financing early on, amounting to half the land's value. The balance of its costs will be funded by equity from the developer and its partners, largely institutional investors, until construction starts.
The money for construction is typically in the form of a bank loan, which will amount to a bit more than half of the total capital costs. Before granting a loan, banks generally require developers to have pre-sold at least 75 per cent of their units - which, among other things, means collecting a 20-per-cent deposit from buyers. One-third or more of the amount of the loan must be guaranteed by the developer and its institutional partners.
If everything goes as Mr. Hoffman plans, the institutions that put in the initial equity will enjoy a return of more than 20 per cent a year on their investment. In his previous projects, he's always managed to exceed that target, an impressive track record that has allowed him to attract some high-profile backers from the U.S. and Canada.
DREAM CMCC Capital Fund, which provides investment capital to developers, is one of the investors in Core Condos and is unfazed by talk of a potential correction in the market. "We've got a lot of people moving to Toronto and they need places to live," says DREAM's Mr. Cooper. "We're not going to have a big increase in single-family homes, so it's going to be in multi-family."
He acknowledges the market did get out of hand for a while as developers without a history of building condos in Toronto rushed to get in on the action. "We were starting to see just too much stuff," Mr. Cooper says. "As somebody said to me today, everybody who ever built a house in the 905 [area code around Toronto] became a condo developer downtown."
On average, about 20,400 condo units started construction each year in Toronto between 2008 and 2012. More than that are expected to come on stream in each of the next three years.
For now, the new supply is running well ahead of the underlying demographic demand. Will Dunning, a housing market analyst who is also chief economist for Canada's mortgage broker association, estimates that the Toronto area will require about 12,800 to 15,800 condo units annually in coming years. But he doesn't see a crash ahead. Today's building boom is making up for a lack of construction more than a decade ago, he argues, while long-term demand will continue to be strong and building is likely to slow.
In the meantime, Toronto has become known for having more high-rises under development than any other city in North America. The construction boom is taking place even as condo sales slow. The number of new units sold last year, 13,797, was down 22 per cent from the year before, and is far below a 10-year average of 17,727 sales a year, according to Urbanation Inc.
Some investors have decided to bow out of the market. "We've taken a hiatus on condos in Toronto since the beginning of 2012," says Martin Zieff, who runs Alcion Ventures, a Boston-based real estate fund that invested in CentreCourt's first two projects.
Profit margins on condos in Toronto "are thinner than you'd find elsewhere in North America," say Mr. Zieff, who started investing in Toronto condos in 1995. "I decided to stop investing in Toronto condos in 2011 because we saw the market getting sloppy and said, 'Why bother?,'" he says. "Why take that risk?"
The design
Armies of consultants are involved in designing a building: interior decorators, architects, mechanical engineers, structural engineers, electrical engineers. There are separate consultants for parking, garbage and even elevators.
At the start of November, Mr. Hoffman tells the team at Cecconi Simone, a Toronto interior design firm, that he wants the majority of the 220 suites in the planned building to be one bedroom units or one-bedroom-plus-dens under 600 square feet. His goal is to complete the final suite plans by Dec. 2, finish terrace design by Dec. 16 and leak renderings of the planned building to blogs by the second week of January to create buzz.
The developers and the designers hash out topics ranging from closet size to whether a balcony can be moved. They debate details of exhaust systems, coils, ducts and bulkheads.
A consultant says they can get away with two elevators, but the developers decide that buyers will demand the convenience and speed an extra elevator will provide, so they add a third anyway - at a cost of roughly half a million dollars, plus a big chunk of floor space that could otherwise have been sold on each floor.
They save money by maintaining the same kitchen and bathroom dimensions throughout the building, enabling them to buy in bulk. They make room for 24-inch built-in dishwashers, rather than 18-inch ones, because the larger ones are cheaper.
Toronto's condo boom has made buyers more demanding, especially the crucial market of young, single professionals. To distinguish one 600-sq.-ft. box from another a couple of blocks away, developers compete to tempt buyers with shared amenities, ranging from juice bars and yoga studios to pools and theatres. Among other things, the luxury features are designed to make units more easily rentable - a key consideration, since Mr. Hoffman estimates that about 60 per cent of buyers in his previous projects plan to rent out their units.
On Nov. 28, the team from Cecconi Simone present their vision for the building's shared facilities - including a gym, bean bag chairs, a café area with free coffee, a tiered sofa, and an outdoor fire pit.
"You nailed it, this is exactly the feel we were going for," Mr. Virani says.
"The only thing I worry about is the photo booth," Mr. Hoffman says. Mr. Virani notes that it's a popular item at a new club downtown. "I just worry about saddling the building with something that could break," Mr. Hoffman says.
"The only question I have is the pool table," Mr. Virani says. "I never really see people playing pool."
"I think it's a great way for people to socialize," Mr. Hoffman counters.
They decide the building will have both a photo booth and a pool table.
The building is ultimately about 20 per cent studios and 25 per cent two-bedrooms, with the remainder in Mr. Hoffman's "sweet spot": one bedrooms or one-bedroom-plus-dens.
The smallest units are about 390 square feet, not much bigger than the master bedroom in many suburban homes. There is one of those on each floor, designed to appeal to cost-conscious buyers. Such "micro' units are one reason the average size of a new Toronto condo has shrunk by 8 per cent over the past decade.
"There have been a lot of examples recently of this micro concept," Mr. Virani says. "We don't push those to unnecessary extremes; we think of it from a livability standpoint."
The selling
A condo's name is vital to its appeal. "We always start with the question, 'Will people say they live in that name?'" Mr. Virani says. "If they get in a cab, are they going to say, 'Take me to 1,500 such-and-such street, or to Tip Top Lofts?'" - the name of a condo project near Toronto's waterfront.
The CentreCourt team decides to name their project Core Condos to emphasize its location in the heart of Toronto. The process of branding and marketing begins.
"It's very much about standing out," says David Klusberg, vice-president of L.A. Inc, the advertising agency hired by CentreCourt. "There's a lot of competition." To whet buyers' appetites, the agency creates a "teaser website," where people can register for more information about the project as it becomes available.
In December, Mr. Virani sits down with key brokers, giving them a sneak peak of some renderings, hoping to create excitement. About 50 agents who sold multiple units of CentreCourt's prior projects come first. As the holidays close in, Mr. Virani does additional presentations for about 100 more agents. He tells them prices will range from the high $300,000 range for studios to about $775,000 for two bedrooms.
"Because we bought the land at the right price and we have the right execution on this, we want to be a value proposition to the buyer," Mr. Hoffman says. The building ultimately comes out at just under $600 per square foot, slightly below average for the Toronto market.
Mr. Hoffman and Mr. Virani are hoping to be the first major downtown launch in 2014 and are targeting a mid-January date, but just before the holidays they hear rumblings that another building might come onto the market sooner. They kick into overdrive.
On Friday, Jan. 3, they release plans, prices and a digital brochure to agents. The agents then pitch the project to prospective buyers and submit "worksheets" to the developers that spell out the units their clients want and which floors they prefer.
Some developments provide "platinum brokers" - the ones who handle the most condo business - with a head start, allowing their buyers first crack at units. Instead, the CentreCourt team blanket the market, accepting worksheets from any agent, in an effort to sell the project as quickly as possible.
Five nights after the Jan. 3 release, with worksheets in hand, Mr. Virani and Mr. Hoffman start to allocate units. A key consideration is who the agent is - one who sells lots of units will get priority over one who rarely dabbles in new condos.
By Sunday morning 80 per cent of the building is sold. The CentreCourt team decides to raise prices, bumping up the cost of a suites by about $10,000. By the end of the weekend, the developer has 185 deals, meaning roughly 85 per cent of the building has sold out.
Everyone is surprised. In a market that is supposed to be cooling, they have managed to go from closing on a deal to buy the land to selling nearly all of the project within about 10 weeks.
"Other developers might have a mindset that if they sold out within 30 days, they've underpriced it, left a lot of money on the table," Mr. Hoffman says. "We'd rather have 100 per cent sold, our deposits in, be very conservatively underwritten, and now focus on the construction."
Mr. Habibzadeh's real estate agent, Roy Bhandari, can't get over it.
"When the guys here told me they were launching on the third of January, I told them, 'You are absolutely crazy,'" he says, sitting in the sales office while Mr. Habibzadeh finishes his paperwork.
"I was literally still in my Christmas pajamas, and I'm like, 'Nobody is buying condos at this time of year, you've got to wait at least a couple of weeks.' But you know what? [They were right.]"

Abstract: "Canadian housing market performance in January was a weather report of sorts, with January's Polar Vortex having dented both resale activity and new construction," CREA chief economist Gregory Klump stated in a press release. "We'll be keeping a close eye on February's numbers for signs of a rebound in Southern Ontario, where sales reflected deferred home purchases due to cold weather rather than home buyers getting cold feet."

Full text:   The number of existing homes changing hands in Canada softened for the fifth month in a row in January, but prices continue their upward climb.
Sales of homes over the Multiple Listing Service dropped 3.3 per cent from December to January on a seasonally adjusted basis, according to data released Friday by the Canadian Real Estate Association, which represents the bulk of the country's real estate agents.
January's sales were 0.4 per cent above those during January of 2013. Sales activity has fallen 9.1 per cent since its peak in August, the association said. In part it blames weather.
"A number of buyers likely waited out January's deep freeze before going house hunting, particularly where I'm from in Southern Ontario," CREA president Laura Leyser stated in a press release.
The majority of Canadian cities saw sales decline in January both from December and a year earlier. The local real estate board in Vancouver, where the market was in a steep slump a year ago, reported earlier this month that January's sales were 30.3 per cent higher than a year earlier, but down 9.9 per cent from December. Sales in the Vancouver area remain 7.2 per cent above the 10-year average. Sales in Calgary, which is currently one of the country's strongest markets, were up 17 per cent from a year earlier, marking the best showing for January since 2008. But sales in Toronto were down 2.2 per cent, and sales in Ottawa were virtually the same - with five more houses selling and 10 fewer condos than January, 2013.
Realtors remain optimistic that the chill on the market will subside.
"Canadian housing market performance in January was a weather report of sorts, with January's Polar Vortex having dented both resale activity and new construction," CREA chief economist Gregory Klump stated in a press release. "We'll be keeping a close eye on February's numbers for signs of a rebound in Southern Ontario, where sales reflected deferred home purchases due to cold weather rather than home buyers getting cold feet."
Nationally there was 6.4 months of inventory (the length of time it would take to sell the number of homes currently on the market at the current rate of sales) in January, up from 6.3 months at the end of December.
Despite the softening, prices continued their trek upward. The average sale price in January was 9.5 per cent higher than a year earlier, at $388,553.

Full text:   Toronto's 'easy' building lots have been gobbled up, but some developers and architects celebrate the nooks and crannies left behind
jmays@globeandmail.com
During Toronto's rapid Victorian build-out, the tidy, right-angled grid of streets and roads being pushed across the landscape frequently collided with the railway corridors that sweep diagonally through the city. Among the results of this mismatch were numerous small, oddly-shaped crannies and nooks of land, backed on to the tracks, that residential developers have traditionally been reluctant to build on.
Their negative attitudes toward these orphaned spaces have been changing, however, as the downtown area's ongoing intensification gobbles up the last properties that are easy to develop (such as large parking lots), leaving only the more problematic ones up for grabs. Interestingly, some places of the latter sort have been occasions for striking architectural gestures - the gracefully tall, romantically textured Massey Tower, on Yonge Street, for example, and the mid-rise complex known as Context King West, both designed by David Pontarini, a founding partner in the firm of Hariri Pontarini Architects (HPA).
As it happens, Mr. Pontarini and his people at HPA are the authors of a still newer residential project on a geometrically challenged spot in downtown Toronto: Garrison Point, a five-tower development whose sales office (for the first two buildings) has opened at 35 Strachan Ave.
The proposed heights of the buildings that have been taken to market are 35 and 29 storeys. Together, they will contain 684 units ranging in size from 511 square feet to 1,300 square feet. Town homes are available, and they vary in area from 1,170 to 2,080 square feet. Advertised prices for apartments start at around $550 a square foot.
The financial partners in this scheme are Cityzen, Fernbrook Homes and DiamondCorp. These conspicuous players in the local real-estate market - all three have sponsored architecturally significant condominium towers - cobbled together Garrison Point's wedge-shaped site from bits and pieces of old industrial land at the junction of two rail lines immediately east of Liberty Village. Both lines carry GO commuter trains. One will be the route of the express transport connecting Union Station and Pearson Airport, which suggests that anyone thinking of taking up residence in Garrison Point should be a fan of the railways, since he will have trains on two sides.
One problem that commonly afflicts such unusual spots in the urban fabric, and that makes them less than desirable for housing, is the sense that they're isolated dead-ends. The thoughtful master-plan for the site of Garrison Point, which has been crafted by Urban Strategies, the private city-design group, proposes to remedy the situation in a couple of ways.
One involves enhancing little Ordnance Street, which exists now as a rough, rubbly extension of East Liberty Street, in order to link better the buildings to Strachan Avenue and Liberty Village beyond. Another involves making provisions for a path that would run across the park projected for the site's eastern extent - the sharp end of the wedge - and connect with city-owned pedestrian bridges bounding over the railway corridors to public green spaces on both sides.
I hasten to add that, as far as executing the master plan goes, only a partial beef-up of Ordnance and the erection of two towers are included in the current phase of work. The park (which is to be designed by Montreal landscape architect Claude Cormier) is not happening now. The foot bridges that the city has set aside money to build are still in the future.
But even though the present, initial phase will embody only a fraction of the interesting general vision for this little parcel, good things can certainly be said about that fraction.
The best of them has to do with HPA's attractive, inventive forming of the first two towers in the project. Instead of shoe-horning ordinary square or oblong blocks into the irregular site, the architects have decided to celebrate the place's irregularity by structuring it right in. The light exterior surfaces bend and shift, sharp edges are sliced away. Each tower appears to be composed of two jauntily different vertical slabs that have been joined and put on a low pedestal, like imaginative abstract sculpture.
We won't know what the three remaining towers will look like until later, but the tall buildings now on the market promise to be memorable. They will be ingenious responses to one of this city's awkward corners, and (if they sell well) smart counter-statements to architects, developers and others who claim that the only kind of high-rise that will fly in the Toronto market is another dumb box.

Full text:   The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board has found a toehold in India's fragmented residential real estate sector with a new partnership to provide debt financing to developers.
The fund, which invests money on behalf of the Canada Pension Plan, said Wednesday its financing arm has formed a strategic alliance with India's Piramal Enterprises Ltd. (PEL) to provide $250-million (U.S.) each toward a debt financing operation for residential projects in many of India's largest urban centres.
CPPIB said the focus for the investments will be top-tier local developers with a strong track record in residential projects. The key cities will be Mumbai, Delhi, Bangalore, Pune and Chennai, which CPPIB said also have favourable growth forecasts for middle-income housing demand.
The deal comes just months after CPPIB unveiled its first real estate deal in India in November, announcing a strategic alliance to acquire office park buildings in India's major cities. CPPIB committed $200-million (U.S.) to own 80 per cent of a venture with partner Shapoorji Pallonji Group.
CPPIB has increasingly turned its investment focus to emerging markets, arguing they have a higher growth rate and better long-term growth trends.
Wenzel Hoberg, CPPIB's head of European real estate investing who oversaw the Indian deals, said the fund already has done real estate investments in China and Brazil, and has targeted India as its next major emerging market.
He said CPPIB was sold on the potential of the residential sector given India's growing middle class, but needed to find a way to invest in the highly fragmented sector without trying to take tiny stakes in local developers. The solution was an alliance with a strong partner, he said in an interview Wednesday.
"By going via debt [financing], we basically have one partner for a national platform, and we can aggregate a lot of little deals into a big package," he said. Debt financing is also lower risk than taking ownership stakes, he added.
In India, land is often purchased in small pieces and bundled into larger packages by a land aggregator, which then sells the parcel to a developer. Mr. Hoberg said the developers typically can access bank financing for the construction phase, but often have to finance the land acquisition themselves.
That can become a major commitment of capital because it can take two to four years to get all the permits in place to begin construction. The new joint venture hopes to find a niche to provide financing for the land purchases.
"We are really filling in a gap that exists in the market today where developers don't have many other sources of funding," Mr. Hoberg said.
"That's kind of an interesting window."
PEL chairman Ajay Piramal said CPPIB's latest venture in India is ideally timed given the strength of the country's real estate sector.
"This is an opportune time to be creating an aligned pool of capital to target what we believe to be very compelling financing opportunities in the real estate sector," he said in a release Wednesday.

Full text:   Yorkville development would be a much-appreciated departure from skin-and-bones towers that now dominate the scene
jmays@globeandmail.com
The intersection of Bloor and Yonge streets is where downtown Toronto ends and everything else begins. It's the site of the most important nexus in the subway system, and a spot where the city's varied scenarios - from posh shopping to grabbing fast food, from mansions to seedy digs - come together and add up to an image of Hogtown civilization.
For all these reasons, architecturally, the crossing ought to be brimming with sophisticated energy and visual imagination.
Bloor and Yonge, however, has not been lucky in the artistic department. The office blocks on the northwest and northeast corners are desperately dull, and the looming concrete carcass of the Bay department store is an aesthetic calamity that should never have been allowed to happen.
But potentially significant things are afoot. Take, for example, the tall mixed-use building, called One Bloor East, now under construction on the southeast corner. If it lives up to its renderings, this graceful tower by Toronto architect David Pontarini will have a romantically sculpted glass skin that sets it apart sharply from the city's more usual, sober-sided modernist condo stacks. Mr. Pontarini's expansive operatic gesture could provide the architectural exclamation point that the intersection has long called out for.
Another project in the vicinity worth keeping an eye on: 1 Yorkville, the $450-million revamping of Victorian shops and raising of a 58-storey tower, which developers Bazis Inc. and Plazacorp Communities are aiming to do at the corner of Yonge Street and Yorkville Avenue. If built out as proposed, this work of restoration and construction will add considerable density to the Bloor-Yonge juncture, emphasizing its importance in Toronto's imagination of itself and likely enhancing the city's inventory of artistically interesting tall residential structures put up since the onset of the current condo boom.
The project will contain 622 suites ranging in size from 475 square feet to more than 2,000 square feet and in price from the mid-$300,000s to more than $2-million. The interior appointments, including three floors of luxury amenities, are by Allen Chan of Toronto-based DesignAgency. In a nod to the culturally cool residents who will likely be among 1 Yorkville's first customers, DesignAgency's scheme features a roof-top movie theatre suitable for twilight screenings in summer. And in a nod to those who enjoy cutting through Yorkville's little passageways, landscape architect Sibylle von Knobloch, of NAK Design Group, will be greening the widened pedestrian lane that will connect Yorkville Avenue and Cumberland Street.
The architectural designer of 1 Yorkville is Rosario Varacalli. Like the other tall buildings he is doing around town - E Condominiums at Yonge and Eglinton, Exhibit on Bloor West, and others - this one echoes his dissatisfaction with the monotony that characterizes too many glassy Toronto towers. So far, he has used subtle surface patterns (E Condos) and has even rotated the levels of a building (Exhibit) in order to animate his exteriors.
This time around, he intends to clad the tower component of 1 Yorkville with 3,000 vertical ribbons of shiny, silvery, twisted metal (aluminum or titanium). These three-dimensional elements, if everything works out according to plan, will give the structure a shimmering, mercurial appearance - all in sharp contrast, that is, to the stolidity of the concrete and steel skeleton underneath this fabric-like surface. Windows will be tall but not wide, and balconies will be inset behind the metallic pilasters. Such moves should give onlookers the sense that the tower is only lightly tethered to the ground - that it is a creature of the sky, not the earth-bound object it is in fact.
Toronto has not seen a high-rise exactly like what 1 Yorkville seeks to be, although the problem Mr. Varacalli is trying to solve is as old as the skyscraper itself. In the early days, especially, when Louis Sullivan was crafting his pioneering tall buildings in the U.S. Midwest and the Europeans were making their first experiments, architects argued about the best way to dress these nearly unprecedented structures. Should cladding conceal the modern bones under premodern garments? Or should it boldly celebrate the skyscraper's material and artistic newness?
The plan for 1 Yorkville is Mr. Varacalli's answer to these questions. Here, he opts for fiction over function, for romance over realism - for an architecture of fugitive visual effects, as opposed to one that refers the viewer back to the hard facts of modern science and engineering.
He is not the only contemporary architect to take this suggestive approach - which involves a kind of return to the inspirations of Baroque design - but he is one of the few in Toronto who is working out his ideas wholly in the midst of the local real estate market. I, for one, look forward to seeing how this creative venture turns out, when it's finished about five years from now.

Full text:   Canadian buyers in Phoenix and Tucson say price should not be the only consideration in a second-home purchase
With retirement only a few years off, Ontario residents Paul and Karen Sullivan weighed the merits of a possible winter getaway property south of the border.
They had their eye on Arizona - but not right away - for its absence of hurricanes, no extra taxes for out-of state buyers, warm, sunny winters and low-maintenance properties without lawns.
But the "at some point" timetable for the Sullivans switched to "now" in early 2011 thanks to a strong Canadian dollar and a severely depressed American housing market.
They paid cash for a three-bedroom house that looks out on a golf course in an upscale gated community in Anthem, 35 minutes north of Phoenix. The five-year-old home sold for $399,000 before the 2007 financial crash, but the Sullivans got it for $269,000.
"At the age we were, we thought if not now, when?" says Mr. Sullivan, 56, a semi-retired financial planner. "With the dollar at par and the [U.S. housing] meltdown, we decided if we were ever going to do it, that was the time."
Increasingly, Canadians are heading to warm-weather destinations in the United States to buy or rent second homes. Florida attracts 40 per cent of Canadians, according to a 2013 survey by the National Association of Realtors, but Arizona ranks second with 24 per cent of snowbirds. NAR data show that 86 per cent of Canadian buyers paid cash, with 47 per cent buying in small towns and resort areas and 41 per cent in suburban communities.
Beyond its reliable weather and lifestyle amenities, Arizona is a draw for its affordability.
In Phoenix, the state's largest city, the mid-point price for a home in the metro area was $191,700 in third-quarter 2013, up 25 per cent from a year earlier, according to the NAR. In Tucson, the second-largest city with 1 million people, the comparable price was $172,400, up 11 per cent from a year ago.
The recent rebound, however, only puts prices back to about 2004 levels.
Price, alone, is not the only consideration in a purchase.
Lifestyle choices (golf, hiking, spectator sports and entertainment), likely length of stay (a few weeks or several months), a preference to rent the property (or not) should all weigh in the decision, Phoenix real estate agent Arnold Porter says. He and his wife Maureen, snowbirds themselves, co-founded Arizona for Canadians in 2007, a real estate firm that caters to Canadian buyers.
Mr. Porter says buyers from Canada need to know U.S. immigration rules, which require a B2 visitor visa for stays of up to six months, as well as U.S. tax rules that apply when foreign owners rent their property for part of the winter. He says Canadians also need to understand provincial rules on health insurance coverage that govern the length of stay (now seven months for many provinces) outside the country.
"Don't just fly down here and go into the local real estate office," Mr. Porter warns. "Make sure you are starting out with what your interests are and how to do it properly."
The Sullivans, for example, choose to rent their home for part of the winter, opting for a gated community to give renters a sense of security. Whether gated or not, many new communities have fee-paying homeowner associations that set rules on house colours and parking. Typically, the fees are included in information when a house goes on the market.
Mr. Sullivan says prospective buyers need to think about their time horizon for ownership, which could affect location and desired amenities.
By contrast, Toronto retirees Ingrid and Tony Ross choose not to rent the three-bedroom home they purchased in Anthem in 2008, after prices tumbled, for $530,000.
They paid through their Canadian bank, but set up an American bank account to facilitate regular payment of utility and other bills. "It's like we don't exist in Canada," says Ms. Ross, of the difficulty in processing cheques from Canada. As is typical for Canadians who spend only part of the year in Arizona, the couple hire someone to check on the house in their absence.
Phoenix has been a top destination for Canadians headed to Arizona, but Tucson is gaining attention as less-congested, less-expensive alternative with easy access to the Sonoran Desert, canyons for bird watching and the ski slopes of 2,791-metre-high Mount Lemmon, says Charlie Bowles, branch manager for Russ Lyon Sotheby's International Realty in Tucson.
Calgary retirees Peter and Debra Jennings, in their early 60s, were familiar with a lot of warm-weather destinations in the United States but had never visited Arizona.
But with so many friends headed to Arizona, a mecca for golf keeners like the Jennings, the couple paid their first visit in 2006.
"Friends told us 'don't just go to Phoenix and buy like everyone else does. There are a lot of really nice places south of Phoenix,'" Mr. Jennings, formerly in the financial services sector, says.
They fell in love with Tucson, a two-hour drive south of Phoenix and one hour north of Mexico.
"It was the same as Calgary and had the same sort of feel, laid back and easygoing," he says.
Initially they built a 2,100-square-foot, three-bedroom ranch for $375,000 on a golf course in a gated residential community in Oro Valley in north Tucson.
Then, as now, they dealt with fluctuating currency exchange. "When we wrote up the deal the Canadian dollar was 82 cents U.S.," Mr. Jennings recalls. "By the time we had to come up with the money, the dollar had gone up to 95 cents."
Last year, the couple sold their house at a loss of $100,000 to relocate to a new upscale residential community on the edge of the posh Ritz Carleton golf course in Dove Mountain. But they gained in the end, by buying a larger home with 2,400 square feet for $348,000, well below asking prices prior to the housing meltdown.

Full text:   Looking beyond market turmoil, CPPIB and EDC anticipate opportunities in Brazil and Colombia
Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Export Development Canada are making major bets on Latin America - despite turmoil in emerging markets and steep drops in South American markets in recent months.
CPPIB will announce Wednesday that it is opening an office in Brazil, becoming the first Canadian pension plan to have permanent staff on the ground in Latin America.
Also Wednesday, EDC, the federal export lender, will open an office in Bogota to help Canadian companies tap a coming infrastructure boom in Colombia.
CPPIB chief executive officer Mark Wiseman said the fund is not deterred by recent market upheavals and currency devaluations; he still believes in the long-term potential of key markets such as Brazil and Chile.
"If you have a long-term view and you understand the dynamic of what's happening - including the demographic dynamic and the expansion of free market economies in those five countries - now is absolutely the right time to be there to establish that long-term presence in the region."
The recent market turmoil obscures a sustained economic turnaround in Colombia, which is poised to invest as much as $55-billion (U.S.) by 2021 in roads, ports, airports, subways and other projects, said Todd Winterhalt, EDC's vice-president of international business development.
"In Colombia, we see an economy that has weathered the ups and downs really well, averaging well over 4 per cent [a year] growth," he said from Bogota.
Canadian companies are well positioned to take advantage thanks to the 2011 free-trade agreement between the two countries, a recent tax treaty and diminished security concerns, he pointed out. Colombia is becoming an important hub for the Andes region and Canada is already the fifth largest foreign investor in the country, with significant mining and oil-and-gas projects. Bogota is the EDC's seventh location in Latin America.
CPPIB has $5-billion of investments in Latin America, including real estate and infrastructure holdings, which is enough "critical mass" to build a bigger portfolio with staff on the ground, Mr. Wiseman said.
CPPIB's office will be in Sao Paulo, which is Brazil's biggest financial centre, and will open in April with an initial staff of three people that will grow to 12 within several months. The pension fund has offices in London and Hong Kong, and opened a new office in New York in January. "Really, the missing piece in terms of regional coverage was having a presence in Latin America," Mr. Wiseman said.
A regional office makes it easier to oversee existing holdings and helps to build contacts that can lead to new deals, Mr. Wiseman said. CPPIB has also found branch offices help prevent investing mistakes because local employees have a better understanding of local people and market conditions.
Staff in Sao Paulo will focus primarily on investments in five key markets that CPPIB has targeted for growth: Bazil, Chile, Colombia, Peru and Mexico, which Mr. Wiseman says are the five strongest economies in the region. The fund does not have large holdings in volatile countries such as Argentina and Venezuela, he said.
"I think we are perhaps a little bit more global a little bit earlier than some of the other Canadian [pension] funds, but I think it's fair to say most of the Canadian funds are headed in a similar direction. It's the nature of where the world is today."

Full text:   Rally extends into 2014 with sales up 30 per cent over same month last year on strength of 1,760 residential transactions
A rally in housing sales and prices in Greater Vancouver has extended into 2014, keeping young buyers focused on modest-sized accommodation.
In January, 1,760 residential properties changed hands, up 30.3 per cent from 1,351 in the same month in 2013, the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver said on Tuesday.
It is the ninth consecutive month that the area has had a year-over-year gain in monthly sales, after a 19-month slump in volume before sales began increasing last May.
Dan Scarrow, vice-president of corporate strategy at Macdonald Realty Ltd., said he sympathizes with parents who worry their children cannot buy a home in the Vancouver region.
Some first-time buyers can get into the market with help from parents who sold their detached homes at good prices, although in today's housing market, young couples from Vancouver still must buy outside the neighbourhoods they grew up in, he said.
"In an ideal situation, every local Vancouverite could sell their home for $5-million and their kids could buy the home for $300,000, but that isn't going to work," Mr. Scarrow said in an interview. "The reason prices are expensive here is that it is a good place to live. A tangible way to reduce real estate prices is to make it an undesirable place to live, and that isn't a very palatable solution."
Real estate observers say living in Canada's most expensive housing market has forced young buyers to focus on condos and townhouses.
Greater Vancouver's residential composite price index rose to $606,800 in January, up 3.2 per cent from a year earlier.
The benchmark price for single-family detached homes reached $929,700 in January, also a gain of 3.2 per cent. Benchmark prices, which strip out the most expensive resale properties, climbed 6.1 per cent to $869,000 over the past year for detached properties on Vancouver's East Side, while they jumped 7.5 per cent on the West Side to $2.14-million.
The rally includes the suburban market, with price increases for detached homes of at least 5 per cent in Burnaby East, Burnaby South and Port Moody.
In the B.C. Fraser Valley, 772 properties sold in January, up 25 per cent from same month in 2013. The Multiple Listing Service home price index rose 0.9 per cent year-over-year to $424,500 in the Fraser Valley, which includes the sprawling and less-expensive Vancouver suburb of Surrey.
Benchmark index prices for condos in Greater Vancouver increased 3.7 per cent over the past year to $371,500, while townhouse prices gained 1.7 per cent to $457,700. In the Fraser Valley, index prices for condos decreased 4 per cent to $192,300, while townhouse prices rose 1.3 per cent to $297,600.
"If you're looking to sell your home in a balanced market, it's critical that your list price is reflective of current market conditions," Greater Vancouver board president Sandra Wyant said in a statement.
A measurement known as the sales-to-active-listings ratio, which is closely watched by the real estate industry, registered 14 per cent in Greater Vancouver last month. B.C. real estate agents consider a market balanced when the ratio ranges from 15 to 20 per cent. It is deemed a buyer's market at below 15 per cent and a seller's market above 20 per cent in the Vancouver region. A total of 12,602 listings were active last month, down 4.9 per cent from a year earlier.

Full text:   How shifts in monetary policy are exposing a chasm in the world's emerging markets. Iain Marlow and Janet McFarland report
As emerging markets faltered, André Bourbonnais went shopping.
Despite the trouble ripping through fragile economies from Argentina to South Africa, Mr. Bourbonnais, who oversees private equity holdings for the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, figured now was as good a time as any to place a specific bet on a particular region.
On Friday, after a week in which other investors pulled nearly $10-billion (U.S.) from emerging economies, CPPIB announced that it paid $200-million for a new 10.4-per-cent stake in Peruvian natural gas transporter Transportadora de Gas del Peru SA (TGP). Mr. Bourbonnais said his investment represents the cornerstone of a long-term partnership to pursue infrastructure deals in select markets in Latin America, underscoring the group's belief in the long-term potential of certain expanding economies, such as Brazil and China - despite the turmoil in a number of other developing countries.
"We're long-term investors," he says. "We understand there are going to be cycles, and we need to be a little more prudent in terms of uncertainty, but clearly we'll continue in emerging markets."
The turmoil is widespread. Currency is being devalued in Buenos Aires. Strong growth in Brazil has waned, and the Turkish lira has plummeted. In South Africa, an ailing economy is mired in miners' unrest, and in China slowing growth is endangering commodity exporters that have been riding the cyclical boom.
Already, the turmoil has wiped $1.7-trillion from global stocks, hurting investors and forcing a re-examination of emerging markets, now sputtering and deemed riskier, endangering global growth.
But these countries are not united by similar problems, such as the bad loans and deficits that led to the 1997 Asian financial crisis. What's happening now is a decoupling of emerging markets from one another that economists suggest is long overdue.
As the tide of capital flows out from a credit boom fuelled by easy monetary policy in the developed world, emerging markets will be revealed either as longer-term winners whose fundamentals remain secure, or shaky, vulnerable economies whose leaders squandered the opportunity to implement meaningful reforms in boom times and will pay the price. And while there is still a risk of contagion, the crisis may also create opportunity for Canadian investors such as the CPPIB.
After years of growth fuelled by the BRICS countries - Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa - emerging markets are being battered. The U.S. Federal Reserve's pullback on its massive stimulus spending - underscored with a further reduction, or "tapering," of its bond-buying on Wednesday - and slowing growth in China has caused investors to pull out of riskier countries and seek safer returns in the United States.
"In and of itself, the Fed tapering should not have been such a big deal. But it was a big deal. It forced a re-examination of the world economy in general - and emerging markets in particular," says Edwin Truman, who served as assistant secretary of the U.S. Treasury for international affairs and was on the G10-sponsored working party on stability in emerging-market economies during the Asian financial crisis. "The difference here, which is sort of good, is this is not Latin America alone, or Asia alone. It's not regional. It's sort of various emerging-market countries around the world. And they each have their own little story."
As things turned sour, India's central bank was the first to strike back. Then came Turkey, followed swiftly by South Africa. One by one, central banks of large but fragile emerging markets raised benchmark interest rates as capital outflows from emerging-market debt and equities reached $9.1-billion, according to Merrill Lynch - which estimates that roughly $15-billion more could be pulled out in coming weeks.
Turkey's hike was as aggressive as they come. The central bank in Ankara gave a jolt of 4.25 percentage points, raising the overnight lending rate to 12 per cent from 7.75 per cent and leaving some worried that Turkey may have run out of firepower. In South Africa, which has been hurt by falling commodity prices and suffered from numerous mining strikes, the central bank unexpectedly raised its repurchase rate to 5.5 per cent from 5 per cent, the first increase since the depths of the global financial crisis in 2008. The magnitude of outflows from emerging-market debt and equity funds, as measured by Merrill Lynch, rival those during the collapse of Lehman Brothers.
Just how bad is this crisis?
Dejà vu?
In the mid-1990s, John Darch thought he had struck a potash bonanza in a remote corner of Thailand. The Vancouver-based mining investor had lined up local Thai partners and was planning to push ahead with a mine in the country's northeast. Southeast Asia was booming and the mine would have enabled them to ship potash to other so-called Tiger economies, which had been growing at an annual pace of about 8 per cent for the previous decade. "It was a bubble waiting to happen," Mr. Darch recalls.
What came next was the Asian financial crisis. As the chaos engulfed Southeast Asia, his partners' financing dried up and Mr. Darch's dream became an early victim of carnage that would crush currencies and claim banks and brokerages from Jakarta to Tokyo. Because what was happening in Thailand was only the beginning.
The trouble spread quickly from a localized crisis in a Thai bubble economy fuelled by bad loans, leaping to Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines. It eventually hit South Korea, a country with few of Thailand's problems. Countries spent billions to defend their currencies before giving up and devaluing. International investors pulled out and ran for safer markets, while the International Monetary Fund lent tens of billions of dollars to stabilize plummeting currencies. The Brazilian and Russian economies tanked the following year.
"I'm sitting on my hands for now, and that's what I'd recommend others do," says Mr. Darch, who runs a sustainable coffee business in Thailand as he pursues other mining licences. "If you're going to invest, I'd stay away. But if you're already there, then just sit tight."
At the same time, Mr. Darch says you can't compare then and now. Others agree. That sort of contagion has not yet happened yet.
Although united by the fallout from the Fed's tapering, economists say these countries suffer from mainly unrelated problems, and that investors can see this as a turning point in how to view emerging markets.
"It's not 1997. Back then, the crisis for emerging markets was they all had similar vulnerabilities," says Neil Shearing of Capital Economics in London. "Whereas you used to be able to lump emerging markets together as one single homogeneous entity, you can't do that any more."
The current troubles are remarkably uneven. In India, slowing growth is laying bare government economic reforms yet to be implemented. In Argentina, economists worry a decade of economic mismanagement and a hastily devalued currency may precipitate a recession. In Turkey, a corruption scandal has led to cabinet resignations while the head of a state-run bank was arrested on graft charges. And in South Africa, falling commodity prices have slammed mining companies and led to violent protests. Hardly uniform problems.
In 1997, countries at the heart of the trouble mostly had fixed exchange rates, little to no reserves, and had coasted on a credit boom that fuelled bad loans and papered over the lack of meaningful economic reforms. They also all had large currency mismatches, in which a country's residents are not adequately hedged against sharp changes in the exchange rate - a fixture of numerous financial crises in emerging markets.
Now, particularly in Asia, that's not the case, according to Rob Simmons, who took over as Asia-Pacific regional manager for Export Development Canada in 1997 as markets tanked, and who now heads Alberta's trade and investment office in Singapore. Exchange rates are more flexible, reserves are much more robust, there are a number of reserve-sharing mechanisms between central banks in the region, according to economists, and there is a lingering wariness about risky investments, particularly in real estate.
"Back then, it was building after building going up in Bangkok," Mr. Simmons says. "Now, that's not happening as much. Memories are long in Southeast Asia. Banks, government and investors remember what happened in 1997."
Canadian exposure
While many investors are pulling out of emerging markets in general, some of Canada's biggest players are selectively staying put in particular places - highlighting the varied potential of different emerging markets. Leo de Bever, chief executive officer of Alberta Investment Management Corp., which invests $70-billion on behalf of Alberta public sector pension funds, said the sweeping downturn across markets presents a great opportunity to invest in stronger countries caught in the stampede.
"We obviously will use this as an opportunity to distinguish between sectors - and countries, in this case - that are likely to be hit less," he says.
"We don't have much sympathy for a place like Argentina, but we obviously have a soft spot for Chile," where the fund has big investments.
"And we like countries like Peru and Colombia because they are trying to follow in the footsteps of Chile."
Brookfield Asset Management, which invested in U.S. shopping malls during the financial crisis of 2008, has $21-billion of assets in South America. "Economic growth can be uneven, and political shifts are occasionally dramatic," Brookfield Asset Management CEO Bruce Flatt wrote in the firm's third-quarter letter to shareholders. But still, he added, "we believe in the long-term potential of emerging markets."
And CPPIB has taken a huge bet on the potential of fast-growing regions, investing over $17-billion in emerging markets as of March 31 last year. The fund argues that the world's centres of economic and demographic power are shifting to countries with higher economic growth rates such as Brazil, China, India, South Korea and Indonesia, and in coming decades they will become the world's best investment markets.
Michael Wissell, senior vice-president of public equities at the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan Board, says recent turmoil has changed nothing about Teachers' investment strategy in emerging markets, where it owns companies in countries such as China, Brazil and Chile.
He said lower prices may also create opportunities for deals on good assets, especially if the drop is overdone in certain markets. Teachers is particularly committed to Asia from its base in Hong Kong, he says, and believes there are long-term opportunities in markets such as China. "We're believers in that area and we're there for the long haul, and we expect to be there for the long haul. We have lots of assets listed in emerging economies, and I would wager a guess that many years from now we'll still have many of those assets."
Winners from the losers?
Still, the speed with which events are unfolding is catching many by surprise. While Argentina was devaluing its currency and protests were growing increasingly violent in the Ukraine, Mr. Simmons was meeting in Singapore with various Canadian and Singaporean bankers. "A number of the banks came in and said what's going on in the Ukraine? With the chaos in Thailand? They were following it hour by hour," he says. "The people that I talked to hadn't seen anything like this in a while. And they hadn't anticipated all of these things happening at once."
That can make it difficult to separate winning emerging markets from those with deeper problems.
One way is figuring out the degree of exposure to two of the biggest current events in the global economy: One being the U.S. taper, the other being China's slower growth. Mexico, for example, is closely linked to the recovering U.S. economy and manufacturing, while commodity-exporting Indonesia has significant exposure to developments in China.
Another thing to look for is ballooning current account deficits and low reserves of foreign exchange, two things that unite Turkey and South Africa, says Capital Economics' Mr. Shearing - who also names Chile, Peru, Thailand and Brazil as countries to watch carefully for signs of the troubles spreading further. On the other hand, the Philippines has run a current account surplus every year since 2003, allowing its central bank to keep interest rates low in order to encourage growth. India, though it narrowed its high current account deficit by banning gold imports, is nevertheless heading into an election - like both Brazil and Turkey - that has prompted concerns of policy paralysis at a time when economists say slowing growth requires substantial economic reforms.
For Razia Khan, an economist who monitors the fast-growing economies of Africa for Standard Chartered Bank in London, there is also optimism. "We seem to be caught up in the eye of the storm now, but there is no realistic expectations that this is going to be sustained," Ms. Khan says. "The reasons why we were positive about emerging markets two or three years ago have not changed."
Yuen Pau Woo, who heads the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada, says chaos in emerging markets represents an opportunity for investors to re-evaluate the entire category. "I would love for this to be a turning point in how people think about emerging markets, not lumping them into one big basket of common traits," he says. "And with China in particular being the most unique and distinctive of them all, not even being deserved to be called an emerging market, but a standalone driver of global growth with its own problems and challenges."
********
THE PROTECTED
Mexico
Mexico is an economic success story despite a brutal, multiyear military campaign against the country's drug gangs. Growth has been boosted by tremendous investment in the auto sector, which has climbed to be the world's third largest from eighth in 2000. Global investors hope Mexico's proximity to the U.S. (which provides U.S.-dollar income from exports) and healthier government finances will protect the country's currency.
China
China is a net exporter, with a positive current account balance, so it should remain mostly immune from the current selloff in emerging markets.
Economic growth remains strong but China is experiencing self-inflicted credit stress caused by overinvestment. Its reprieve could be temporary.
South Korea
South Korea is an emerging-market country in name only. Government finances were reformed after the Asian currency crisis of 1997 and a current account surplus of about 4 per cent of gross domestic product is expected in 2014. South Korea multinationals like Samsung would welcome some currency depreciation as it struggles to compete with Japanese exporters using the crumbling yen.
THE EXPOSED
India
India has the combination of slow growth, high inflation and a big current account deficit that characterizes the weakest emerging-market currencies. The Reserve Bank of India was forced into a series of interest rates hikes beginning in 2013 as investment assets fled the country. The falling currency led to inflation as the cost of imported goods climbed, preventing interest rate cuts that could spur economic growth.
Turkey
In Turkey, political upheaval is adding to the problem of poor government finances. An attempted purge of political supporters of self-exiled Islamic leader Fethullah Gulen has created instability that threatens the government's access to global bond markets. The country's projected 6-per-cent current account deficit means it has no choice but to borrow, and heavily, to keep paying its bills.
South Africa
The South African rand would have likely sold off even without the large-scale labour action by the country's mining union. Like Turkey, the government needs to access the bond market to fund its large current account deficit. So, after Turkey's stunning interest rate hike of 4.25 percentage points, South Africa's low relative yields could not compete for global investor investment.

Full text:   As condos push into the area, architects are looking at new ways to build, preserve and adapt; a scheme for 'shared apartments'
Evidence of the latest wave of change to batter Vancouver's Chinatown is visible on Main and Keefer, where the old dollar store that sold choice trinkets from China has finally vanished. Its "Going Out Of Business" sale extended well over two years. The recorded hawker's voice in Chinese and English blaring from outdoor speakers was a familiar aural fixture on the street - a slew of Cantonese bargain hunting tips punctuated by the occasional, heavily accented "Everything must go, eh!"
Now everything has gone to make room for one of several new residential towers. Westbank's 17-storey 188 Keefer has displaced the dollar store and is joined by the Foad Raafi-designed Keefer Block across the street and the Inge Roecker-designed Panther development, The Flats on Georgia. Facilitated by 2011's rezoning of a handful of areas in Chinatown, these and other new projects have joined the likes of the Keefer Bar, Bao Bei and a freshly made-over night market as promising signs of neighbourhood revival.
But the battle to save the nearby 439 Powell St. - the 1891 Ming Sun Building that housed seniors and an artists collective - looms large in local headlines. Activists are fundraising to make necessary repairs and prevent its demolition.
With the arrival of the condos, some say Chinatown's architectural heritage is at risk.
In an era when Chinese were barred from being architects, buildings designed for Chinatown fused the tastes of Chinese clients with the talents of Anglo-Saxon architects. Thus, many of Chinatown's buildings exhibit a combination of Southern Chinese-style balconies and façades, laced with Western elements such as Corinthian columns.
The area has survived the affect of racist exclusionary laws, a freeway and the drugs and poverty brought by the concentration of social services in the Downtown Eastside. But will it survive the new influx of condos?
A new project by Taipei born, Vancouver-raised developer Mark Shieh, may well be a model for future development in the area.
"Heritage preservation in Chinatown," says the 39-year-old developer, whose Take Root Properties was behind the successful River Market at New Westminster Quay, "is not just about the empty shell of the building. It's about the activities that go on within it."
"A Chinatown that works," says Mr. Shieh, "is one that is active. Active as a place where people live, work, and play."
His concept is to build on Chinatown's context and meaning. "We've learned from River Market that tourists go where locals go," he says, pointing to an integrated neighbourhood model rather than an "ethnic theme park."
His vision is for a mid-rise building with a food hall on the ground floor - a Pan-Asian version of Manhattan's famed Eataly (an emporium of all things edible and Italian) - that would draw in locals and visitors. Above this would be retail, office and studio space, which Mr. Shieh envisions would include a Chinese school, then a selection of "shared" apartments and a rooftop social club.
This new model of neighbourhood development is not only concerned with local revitalization but also with larger issues around affordability. The normal approach to this is usually to make residential units smaller. But Mr. Shieh - who had a prise de conscience when he realized he didn't want to be part of a design industry that blindly fed consumption - has a different take. "It's not about owning any more - it's about access."
He cites businesses such as C ar2Go and Airbnb as models for sharing resources. And for many years, he's been studying old and new models of shared housing - in both China and the West.
The initial conceptual designs for the building done by Vancouver's Dialog looked to inter-generational living as a way to beat high real estate prices. Thus, the concept of shared apartments, units that feature separate entrances, bedrooms and bathrooms along with shared kitchen and laundry facilities.
Mr. Shieh hopes design savvy will make Chinatown attractive to a whole new generation of Asian-Canadians, lured by the cultural vibrancy and young enough to no longer feel repelled by the ghettoization of their grandparents' time. He says the trend away from Chinatown into suburbs such as Richmond peaked in the nineties, and now many young Asian immigrants are attracted to Chinatown for its urbanity, shops and eateries.
Mr. Shieh himself is typical of the new wave of Chinatowners reinventing and reinvigorating the area. He lives with his American artist wife and two-year-old daughter in the Bruce Hayden designed Schoolhouse - a 1940's school converted into five eco-sensitive residences on East Georgia. He takes his daughter to Mandarin classes weekly - followed by a visit to the Boss bakery for pastries. The bakery, a Hong Kong-inspired café with vaguely Westernized dishes, looks out onto the looming new towers on Keefer.
"It's not just about preserving Chinese-ness anymore," he says, noting that many young Japanese and Korean people are part of the area's growing pan-Asian community, "it's about, 'What is the essence of Chinatown to be transferred to future generations?'"
"We want to create something new here."

Abstract: The developers are just beginning to market the location, and are looking to attract a range of retailers, including lifestyle stores, grocery stores, restaurants and smaller department stores. Mr. [Steve Diamond] said the Concord Adex project (CityPlace) to the south of "The Well" has brought an abundance of residential space to the area without any significant office or retail component.

Full text:   The developers who bought the land that The Globe and Mail's Toronto headquarters sits on will soon be filing plans with the city for the creation of a new neighbourhood that they are calling "The Well."
If the $1.4-billion project is approved, the site, which stretches across nearly eight acres west of Spadina Avenue, between Front Street and Wellington Street, would be home to seven buildings. More than half of the development would be retail and office space, including restaurants and entertainment venues, and a little less than half would be residential. The latter would likely include both condos and rental apartments, as well as some townhouse units. One of the buildings would be a 34-storey office tower.
The property's owners are RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust, which specializes in shopping centres and retail projects; Allied Properties Real Estate Investment Trust, an office developer; and Diamond Corp., which focuses on residential development. Some of the buildings on the site would incorporate all three uses.
"I don't think there has been a new community built in the city with that kind of mix in many, many years," says Steve Diamond, the CEO of Diamond Corp.
The team flew to England about a year ago to study projects such as Butler's Wharf in London for inspiration.
"In England they've done a good job of creating complex mixed-use projects that are pedestrian-friendly," Mr. Diamond said.
All of the parking on the Toronto site would be underground, and the proposal features wide sidewalks as well as a park dubbed Wellington Plaza. The plans changed over time as the developers met with local residents, who were worried about the implications for the area.
The developers are just beginning to market the location, and are looking to attract a range of retailers, including lifestyle stores, grocery stores, restaurants and smaller department stores. Mr. Diamond said the Concord Adex project (CityPlace) to the south of "The Well" has brought an abundance of residential space to the area without any significant office or retail component.
The developers will need permission from Metrolinx, the regional transit authority, to put in a walkway that it envisions on the south side of Front Street. As they seek to win over the city, the project's backers are emphasizing that the new office space could provide a location for about 4,000 jobs and the retail space, more than 1,000. If approved, construction would begin in 2016 and take five to seven years to complete.

Living 'up country' and loving it

Full text:   Our city friends thought we were crazy to retire to an off-grid, mountain homestead. Though we made mistakes, we don't regret it
The first thing we did when we moved from Vancouver to an off-grid retirement homestead in the mountains near Kamloops was to think of a nickname for ourselves - to get in front of our story before somebody else did.
Almost everyone in our hamlet straddling the Thompson River has one. Some are flattering. Others aren't. We were afraid of being dubbed "the fools on the hill," though we realized that, to our new neighbours and old friends in the city, we probably fit that description.
We have made many of the same mistakes made by others who built their dream homes, yurts and straw-bale cabins in the area: We spent more building the house than we could ever sell it for, we underestimated the cost of drilling a well in a desert and failed to appreciate the difficulty of building roads through a rock farm. We paid too much for everything, and bought equipment that we really didn't need to raise farm animals that became family pets.
Daisy, our miniature "test" goat, is allowed in the house on movie nights, and happily curls up on the couch, munching on carrots and watching Humphrey Bogart. We gave up our plans to raise goats to sell for meat after hearing that first endearing little bleat.
As for building a solar-powered house, barn and cabin in the bush ... well, we are still married. The long and windy road to an occupancy permit was littered with the stories of wannabe country squires who ran out of money before they had a chance to live the rural lifestyle they fantasized about. (More than a few have ended up back in the city, living in a basement suite, scraping by on a pension.)
Like them, we had cashed in our Vancouver-area real-estate chips to live large in the country. Our community had become overrun with wealthy yuppies, our old house was overshadowed by new mansions. We felt it was time to move on, taking with us our three elderly horses and three big dogs.
For the cost of a studio apartment in a scary part of the city, we bought 160 acres of forest and open meadows with staggering views of the river valley below.
While most of our sixtysomething friends moved to condos close to hospitals, and confined their travel to cruises and all-inclusive resorts, we cut and split firewood, chipped ice from water buckets in the barn, put chains on the truck tires and learned to use a shotgun.
My friends in Vancouver, whom I visit regularly, shiver at my somewhat exaggerated tales of fending off cougars and coyotes, and snowshoe jaunts in minus-20 degree weather.
But the physical benefits of our new lifestyle were marked: We both lost weight, tossed blood-pressure medication in the garbage and slept better than we had in years. The psychological and social changes during our first year "up country" were harder to measure but equally profound.
In our urban life, we rarely experienced physical discomfort: When we were cold, we fired up the furnace. When things broke, we hired someone to fix them. On the mountain, we were on our own. The plumbers we called to fix frozen pumps or burst pipes that first winter were out of town, enjoying tropical vacations paid for by people like us. We relied heavily on Google, and on each other, to solve our problems. We became a team.
Like many suburbanites, we used to think the world - along with all cultural, political and intellectual activity of any consequence - ended at the outskirts of the city. Until we moved to the other side of the rural-urban political divide, that is.
Our friends from the city, who flocked to visit us our first summer in the wilderness, admired the views from our alpine retreat but assumed that the novelty of our rustic lifestyle would soon fade and that we would come home. Our urban guests, some of whom arrived clutching the necessities of life - cases of Perrier, soy milk, gluten-free snacks - didn't see the wild beauty of the land we love. Instead, they saw dirt, bugs and danger.
"What do you do up here, anyway?" they would ask.
Well, we read several newspapers a day online, take courses at the local university and are discovering the artisans, winemakers and eccentrics living in the small towns and cities around us. We go to the theatre more often than we did in Vancouver.
We ride our horses on our own trails in the summer and have learned to ski on those trails in the winter. Our circle of friends expanded to include people who are not at all like us.
By the time we headed into our second year on the mountain, we were becoming part of our close-knit community. As word spread of the arrival of a "lawyer from da coast" - our joint nickname - we had several visits from locals seeking counsel, and coffee. When they found out my husband did not practise family or criminal law, however, some were clearly disappointed.
"Corporate law, huh," one visitor sighed. "What is it you do, exactly?"

Tricon's smart approach to U.S. housing

Abstract: Fundamentally, the U.S. market looks to be the safer place. "Due to the depths of the crash and what that's done to housing starts, these things tend to overshoot to the downside," Mr. [Jeff Young] said. "We're in a rebuilding phase, and I think there's still a few years of that left."

Full text:   Toronto-based investing company has built up a portfolio of more than 3,000 single-family homes in now-recovering markets
For Canadian investors, there's a smart way to play the U.S. housing recovery, without taking on too much risk and without direct exposure to the falling loonie.
Tricon Capital Group Inc. is a Toronto-based investing company that pounced on the U.S. housing crisis, scooping up distressed properties and homes in the markets most afflicted by the crash. So long as the rebound continues, Tricon will profit, as it has for several months. But what set the company apart are its multiple sources of exposure to residential activity, which help to smooth out the risk in what remains an erratic sector.
"I would put this out as a less volatile way to play that trend," said Jeff Young, chief investment officer at NexGen Financial Ltd. "Typically, you're going to get a lot more volatility in a pure home builder."
For the biggest U.S. home builders, last year was a fickle one. D.R. Horton Inc., PulteGroup Inc., Lennar Corp., Ryland Group Inc., Meritage Homes Corp., KB Home - they all followed the same pattern - riding market gains to multi-year highs, before crashing in May.
It was the U.S. Federal Reserve that played spoiler to the sector. When chairman Ben Bernanke hinted in the spring at taking the first step of withdrawing monetary stimulus, those most directly exposed to the U.S. housing resurgence were punished amid fear that the Fed's move would push borrowing rates up and reduce the demand for new homes.
Between May and August, home-builder stocks fell more than 40 per cent. But Tricon was relatively resilient. Its stock was hit by the same concerns, but the effect was muted, with shares falling 16 per cent. Also, while none of the big U.S. home builders have returned to their pre-loss peaks, Tricon hit a new all-time high closing price of $8.24 on Jan. 10.
The majority of the company's stock value comes from its co-investments with other investors in U.S. residential developments. The company also has directly built up a portfolio of more than 3,000 single-family homes, which it expects to increase to 4,000 units by the end of this year.
"Tricon's taken a much more measured approach with their local partners. It's not just dumb Canadian money coming down and just buying things without really knowing," Mr. Young said.
Tricon also receives fees for managing a portfolio of assets on behalf of other investors.
"There are three different ways they get exposure to residential real estate. That's unique," said Trevor Johnson, an analyst at National Bank Financial, who initiated coverage on the stock last week with a target share price of $10. "The revenues and cash flows are coming from different sources. And the asset-management fees are a little less volatile. They're not as directly tied to home-price appreciation."
With a certain degree of diversification within U.S. real estate, the company is not quite as susceptible to market concerns as are the pure-play home builders, Mr. Johnson said.
The same goes for real estate investment trusts. REITs were also hammered last year over the expectation that interest rates would rise. "We believe Canadian REITs are at the end of a 20-year era of exceptional returns driven by declining interest rates," CIBC World Markets declared in a recent report.
Fundamentally, the U.S. market looks to be the safer place. "Due to the depths of the crash and what that's done to housing starts, these things tend to overshoot to the downside," Mr. Young said. "We're in a rebuilding phase, and I think there's still a few years of that left."
Mr. Johnson said he sees Tricon's assets "growing pretty aggressively" over that period, building up exposure to a healing market, while maintaining a risk profile just a little different from that of the big players.
Geoffrey Kwan, a RBC Dominion Securities analyst, who has a $9.50 target, calls Tricon "the best way to play a recovery in U.S. housing within our coverage universe."

The Globe and Mail and Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre join forces for a rare, uncensored look at he challenges Canadian hospitals face on the ground, and what doctors, nurses and other key players think it will take to meet them. This is the first in a five-part series
*****
When universal health care was in its infancy, real estate agent Sharron Baker was a young woman. Now, like the health-care system itself, she is aging and in need of a refit. After cheerfully enduring a decades-long love/hate relationship with her left knee, Ms. Baker, 67, had replacement surgery at Sunnybrook's Holland Orthopedic and Arthritic Centre in downtown Toronto in November.
To a casual observer, the two-hour surgery seemed like a small construction project - retro-fitting the back porch came to mind. The amazing part was watching Ms. Baker show off her dexterity and stamina two days later as she gamely made it up and down a hospital corridor with the help of a walker.
And then she was discharged, thanks to Sunnybrook's Home on Day 3 initiative aimed at getting surgery patients in and out more quickly and freeing up beds in a hospital that, like many in urban Canada, typically runs at more than 100-per-cent capacity.
Leaving hospital so soon wasn't easy for Ms. Baker. Even though she had family support, including moving into a ground-floor bedroom with adjoining bath at her son's home, she found the aftermath gruelling. Recovering from surgery "is a slow process," she says. "They need to spend more time on that aspect."
It's not perfect, but the "day three" program is one solution for the health-care conundrum about who should get hospital beds, how long they should stay in them and who looks after patients when they are released. Sunnybrook, like all hospitals, is faced with a growing number of aging patients who are living longer than ever and coping with more and more complex needs. At the same time, it is being squeezed by budget cuts. And, just like Ms. Baker, it doesn't have much time to recover.
Ms. Baker's short hospital stay and post-operative difficulties are symptomatic of a hospital system that is only just evolving to match the country's changing demographics.
Back in the mid-1960s, when universal health care was instituted, mandatory retirement meant that people quit working at 65. Most of them conveniently died within the next decade.
Now, we never have to retire and life expectancy is heading into the stratosphere. A 60-year-old man in 2013 will live long enough to celebrate his 87th birthday, according to recent figures from the Canadian Institute of Actuaries. His female counterpart will likely reach 90. Whether either will be in robust health is not nearly so certain: Medical successes in combatting rapacious killers such as cancer, heart disease and diabetes means people are living long enough to be afflicted with dementia, depression and other chronic and complex diseases of old age.
In the 1960s, the average age in Canada was 27; now it is 47. "Our interaction with the health-care system tended to be in and out," Deb Matthews, Ontario's Minister of Health and Long-Term Care, says of the past. "If you needed your appendix out, you would go into hospital and get it out and then go home and be healthy again."
Even "getting out," though, meant staying in hospital longer, and there were more family members to help us recover when we did leave. Nowadays, a lot of those expectations have been passed on to patients. We are supposed to keep ourselves healthy and active, and to make arrangements ahead of time for post-operative care when we are briskly wheeled through the revolving hospital door.
Hospitals have no choice but to push more onto patients, because they are overloaded. A survey this week by the Commonwealth Fund ranked Canada last among 11 OECD countries for wait times to see a family physician, an issue that is forcing thousands of patients to head to emergency departments for routine complaints.
Seniors are another problem: Sunnybrook has them stuck in more than five per cent of its beds while they wait for a spot in rehab, nursing homes or community hospitals. And Sunnybrook is not unique. There are more than 2,500 patients, known as bed-blockers, clogging up hospitals across Ontario.
But if there is an escalating problem with capacity and costs now - people over 65 account for almost one-half of every health care dollar spent in Canada - imagine what will happen when baby boomers like Ms. Baker hit old age. Nearly one-quarter of all Canadians, or 7,844,309, people will be over 65 by 2030.
That may sound like a long time away, but change is hard and turning around something as creaky and as beloved as medicare is a monumental dilemma.
No time to waste
The good news scenario is that baby boomers are relatively healthy and mainly determined to stay that way, says Camille Orridge, chief executive officer of the Toronto Central Local Health Integration Network (LHIN), one of the 14 administrative bodies through which funding flows from the Ontario government to health-care providers, including Sunnybrook. "We [she includes herself in the cohort] are not all crashing at 65 the way our parents did," she says.
That gives Canada some flexibility to fix the health-care system before boomers need chronic and long-term care, but there's no time to waste.
"We must identify the problems and find solutions now," Ms. Orridge warns. The next couple of decades, until the earliest boomers reach their mid-80s, offer a respite in which to build the health-care system of the future, she says, one that goes way beyond "acute hospitals" and a "sick-care system."
One potential solution that Sunnybrook is already implementing is telemedicine. It would have been a boon for Ms. Baker, who was dealing with doctors and physiotherapists in one community while recuperating in another.
Once considered a way to bring specialist services to remote communities, telemedicine is now making the patient experience better in urban areas. Who needs to trek half-way across town on a series of streetcars and buses, or fight traffic and pay exorbitant fees in hospital parking lots, to wait for hours in a clinic for a five-minute consultation about your blood tests? Telemedicine connects patients, specialists, primary doctors and home-care workers on a secure form of video conferencing without anybody leaving home or office.
Besides cutting down on the time and anxiety of travelling, telemedicine has an unexpected bonus: Patients like it because they can hear the interaction between specialists and primary-care providers and they can participate in the conversation about their own recovery or treatment.
The only remaining hitch - traditional doctors who are accustomed to billing patients per office or clinic visit and are loath to embrace a newfangled notion such as telemedicine - should be overcome with a new billing code that allows doctors to charge for electronic consultations.
Improved surgery techniques are another huge factor in cutting costs and moving patients in an out of expensive acute-care hospitals as quickly as possible. When colorectal surgeon Dr. Andy Smith began operating at Sunnybrook in the late 1990s, the typical hospital stay for a colon resection was 11 days. Now it is down to three days and it is going to get shorter, he says, because of "minimally invasive surgery, new approaches to pain management" and because "the care that those folks need is being backfilled by home care."
The Sunnybrook knee clinic, where Ms. Baker had her surgery, has cut down on waiting times to see a specialist, increased operating-room efficiencies - as many as four patients a day - and greatly enhanced mobility for a wide range of people, from fortysomething athletes with sports injuries to active boomers who want to stay that way such as Ms. Baker to seniors crippled with arthritis.
Help, at home
But the big issue remains: What happens to patients when they leave the hospital? Home care, the part that was missing from the original medicare formula, is at "the coal face of patient care," according to Barry McLellan, CEO of Sunnybrook.
Ms. Baker's post-operative problems came largely because she fell between the cracks of two regional Community Care Access Centres (CCACs), which were supposed to provide her with follow-up. She couldn't drive, she was in pain, her family doctor wasn't in the loop about her post-operative care and, because she lives outside Toronto, it wasn't convenient for her to go back to the Holland Centre.
At one of Ms. Baker's lowest points, the five-year-old daughter of a neighbour came into her bedroom for a visit. "Are you crying?" the blonde little girl with big blue eyes asked. "Don't worry," she advised. "It will heal. It just takes time."
Charmed, Ms. Baker says, "that little child came and turned my life around." But, she adds, someone should have faxed a form requesting rehabilitation to her local CCAC before surgery.
Dr. McLellan is sympathetic. As a physician he was a trauma leader; as an administrator he is diagnosing and treating a system-wide crisis. Doctors can boast of efficiencies that allow them to turnstile patients in and out of acute-care beds thanks to innovative surgical techniques and enhanced pain medications, but who is going to pick up the slack when those post-operative patients hit the streets?
"More than 50 per cent of my time is spent talking about improving the care in and around the hospital," Dr. McLellan says . "We believe we have a very major role in helping to shape and improve care that is being provided outside the walls of the hospital."
That means working closely with people like Ms. Matthews and Stacey Daub, CEO of the Toronto Central CCAC.
"We are set up to provide specialized care for people who have unique and special needs - be it trauma, cancer, heart, high risk maternal and neonatal - but we also need to be sure that our complex patients are transferred with a really good care plan to another organization, say rehab, or home," Dr. Mclellan says. "That part is incredibly important to our functioning as a hospital."
What we also need, says Ms. Orridge, "are more retirement homes and more assisted-living homes on Main Street, so you can go out with your walker and get your milk and go back home." She didn't add, and be safe and well cared for , but that is the warning coming out of the horrific tragedy in L'Isle-Verte, Que., where a fire early Thursday morning ravaged a senior's home, leaving five people dead and another 30 missing. That "is the other piece about how we address the numbers thing - not just with hospitals."
Ontario hospitals' operating budgets are in the deep freeze - from an era when they were growing at six per cent annually, they are now at zero, even though labour costs are rising by two per cent a year. Home and community care are the only parts of health care in Ontario that are getting an increase in funding because, says Ms. Matthews, "we know that people recover more quickly at home." The top-up this year, including meals on wheels and other community supports, is six per cent, or $260 million in an overall provincial health-care budget of more than $45 billion.
Still, every penny that goes to home care is money that isn't going to hospitals. You'd think that Sunnybrook's CEO would resent that. Not so. The days of hospitals as temples in which august male physicians held court have vanished, if they ever existed.
"We need to make better use of our resources because this wave is coming," says Dr. McLellan.
A future in its past
At Sunnybrook, that wave is already lashing the shoals.
On a cold January morning, Michael Graydon arrives for his music therapy session. Trim in his long-sleeved pewter T-shirt and trousers, he's 91, but with his chiselled profile and slate grey hair, he looks a dozen years younger - a candidate for a Grecian Formula commercial.
But, Mr. Graydon, a retired dentist and a jazz lover, has dementia. When he's agitated, he can't sleep and works out obsessively, doing crunches, planks and sit-ups by the hour; when he's confused, he gets angry and can be verbally and physically abusive, especially if wartime memories - experiences that he never shared with his family - roar to the surface of his damaged brain.
(Michael Gradyon is not the patient's real name. His family requested anonymity because he is unable to give consent.)
Because he's a Second World War veteran who served in a combat zone, Mr. Graydon is entitled to live at Sunnybrook in the Dorothy Macham Home (DMH), a special 10-bed unit that is part of Sunnybrook's veterans' centre and a national model for treating people with severe behavioural issues.
Nobody wants to have dementia - least of all me - but the Alzheimer's Society projects that more than a million of us will suffer from the devastating disease by 2030, the same year that one in four Canadians will be over 65. Watching the sensitivity and kindness with which Mr. Graydon and other veterans are treated makes the prospect so many of us face almost bearable - if we could be so fortunate to find a spot in a place like the veterans' centre.
Mr. Graydon is one of more than 500 veterans living in nursing-home rooms and long-term-care beds at Sunnybrook. They pay less than $1,000 a month for food and accommodation, with the rest supported by an annual grant of $25 million from Veterans Affairs Canada (VAC). Their average age is 91, half of them have dementia and more than 200 are plagued with complex conditions needing continuing medical care. Some, like Mr. Graydon, require constant supervision on a locked ward.
Ironically, Sunnybrook's past may be the nkey not only to its future, but to how all of us should care for an increasingly elderly and infirm population. Founded after the Second World War as a soldier's hospital, Sunnybrook has morphed over the decades into a specialized regional hospital in trauma, stroke, burns, cancer and neonatology, but the geriatrics practised over the decades in the veterans' centre is an important part of its ongoing role as a teaching hospital.
"There is an interesting thing that happens when you care for a cohort," says Jocelyn Charles, medical director of the veterans' centre. A former family physician, she has worked at the centre since 1990. "As they age, their care needs change," she says. "That is different from being a facility in the community caring only for older people."
Over the years, Dr. Charles and her staff have acquired a vast depth of knowledge and experience about geriatrics, skills that could provide a primer in treating an aging population with chronic complex diseases in a changing health-care system.
'Go with the flow'
From the outside, DMH looks like a suburban brick bungalow with gardens and a cedar hedge - which camouflages a fence that keeps patients from wandering away. Dr. Charles likes to tell a story about the veteran who obsessively dug up perennials in the freshly planted gardens; when the landscapers complained, a staff member replied, "but it is his garden."
Instead of restraints and heavy medication, care in the DMH is based on the mantras "go with the flow," and "anticipate the unmet need, whether it is physical, social, emotional, or related to a past experience." These patients may not be here by choice, but we should all be so lucky if we have to be incarcerated - think of Francesco Greco, who was charged with murdering his 87-year-old roommate Francisco DaSilva in a Toronto nursing home in November. There have been 60 such homicides involving seniors in nursing homes across Canada in the past dozen years, according to a CTV W5 investigation. In the home-like atmosphere of DMH, by contrast, there's a stone fireplace and a nurse's station outfitted like a den, staff adhere to a patient-driven schedule under which veterans eat when they are hungry and sleep when they are tired; the television is controlled so that news of insurgent attacks or suicide bombers won't trigger buried memories and activate post-traumatic stress episodes.
Down the corridor I hear a discordant and low-pitched chanting from a patient's room. "He started singing when we put up the Christmas tree a month ago, and he hasn't stopped yet," explains patient manager Sylvia Buchanan.
"That must be annoying," I say.
The deadpan look on her face is an essay in patience as she steers me back to the dining room. A few of the other patients, oblivious to the man who is stuck like a broken record in the middle of a song, are eating lunch. One of them, a lanky fellow with a shock of white hair tells me at least 10 times in as many minutes how he jumped out of planes behind enemy lines during the D-Day invasion of Normandy. Each repetition is climaxed by a proud flash of his wrist watch, which has Juno Beach 1944 imprinted on its face. I find the performance both haunting and charming because I am awed by his bravery and he reminds me of Matthew Cuthbert in Anne of Green Gables , but I don't have to live with him.
What's next
Few people outside the higher echelons of Sunnybrook and VAC realize that the last of these veterans of the Second World War and the Korean War will die within the next few years. The spacious veteran's facility, with its Inuit art collection, comfortable reception areas, concerts, barbershop and dentist's chair, will no longer be needed and the money will stop flowing from VAC for their care.
"We will continue to support war veterans for as long as they need to be cared for at Sunnybrook," says Sandra Williamson, VAC's director of long-term care and disability benefits. But, "it is not a federal facility, so the future of what happens will be determined by Sunnybrook in consultation with the Ontario Ministry of Health."
Will the lessons learned caring for the veterans be applied to ordinary folk in a rapidly aging country? Could Sunnybrook be a model for other hospitals with veterans' beds across the country? Or will the doors be locked, turning once vibrant facilities into expensive artifacts?
Health Minister Deb Matthews says it is Sunnybrook's responsibility to get together with the LHIN and put together a proposal. And that includes a pitch to cover the $25 million annual shortfall that Sunnybrook currently receives from VAC.
"Is there a fixed plan?" Dr. McLellan asks rhetorically sitting across from me at a meeting table in his sun dappled office. Not yet.
"The worst thing we would want to see are plans to build a new facility because [the government] thinks it will be needed in three, five, 10 years down the road, when we have a facility like that," Dr. McLellan says, nodding his head to indicate the veterans' centre that most of us only know from watching Remembrance Day services on television.
He understands better than anybody that there will be beds open in 2016 unless VAC changes its admission criteria.
The clock is ticking, as it is for the rest of the health-care system.

YOUR SAY
We asked readers about how they think hospitals need to change. Among their concerns:
Superbugs and superbills
My husband required two major surgeries earlier this year, one that required a stay in ICU - where he contacted C Difficile. Since that time he has been hospitalized five times with this infection. And one of the major issues for us has been the expense of the drugs to treat it. We are seniors on a fixed income. I feel the drugs should be provided as it was acquired in the hospital.
Helen J Baker
Long-term care
The Alberta government has ignored the demographics of our aging population for years - decades even - let alone the Boomers waiting in the wings. And there's been no attempt to build even a modicum of long-term care facilities in this province. Are other provinces this out of touch?
Patricia Hartnagel
Dr. Wait
A few years ago, I was visiting my elderly mother in England when the car door shut on her finger. She was told she needed an X-ray at the "small injuries clinic" at the local hospital - where she was triaged, seen by a nurse-practitioner, X-rayed and treated within 40 minutes! I asked the nurse whether she needed to be checked by an emergency room doc and was told that one would have been called had it been necessary. Being assessed by a physician for every visit seems to me to be one of the reasons for the length of time people wait in ER here, and take up beds unnecessarily.

Full text:   Upturn in the market has real estate agents and builders in a positive mood
kgold@globeandmail.com
Last year marked a return of confidence to Vancouver's real estate market, with a 14-per-cent increase in sales over the year before, according to the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver.
Another year-end report, this one by Landcor, showed the single family detached price up 6.39 per cent in 2013, with the average Metro Vancouver house price at $869,772. And in its fourth quarter housing analysis of 2013, the B.C. Real Estate Association predicted another 6.3-per-cent increase in sales for 2014, with residential price to go up by another 2.1 per cent in 2014.
It's not staggering change, but it's change in the right direction for brokers who worried about the downturn in sales in 2012.
"Halfway through last year, confidence returned to the market," says Royal LePage managing broker Bill Binnie, who owns several Lower Mainland franchise offices.
Royal LePage recently released its house price survey that said the average price for a detached bungalow increased 4 per cent year over year to $1,041,300, while the two-storey house increased to $1,139,050, or 3.3 per cent in Vancouver.
Condo prices rose 2.3 per cent, to $492,500. The firm's market survey forecast predicts the momentum will carry into 2014, with price increases of 4.4 per cent in 2014.
"We saw the number of transactions increase," says Mr. Binnie. "Even though prices were up only marginally, it was a very different market than the last of half of 2012 - far more active."
Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp.'s tightening of mortgage insurance rules had an impact on Vancouver's 2012 and early 2013 market, he says.
"We had both buyers and sellers sitting on the sidelines for almost a whole year, largely as a result of changes to the CMHC - or at least the timing was the same. So I think the results that the government wanted to achieve as far as slowing the market down certainly worked. In other words, there were a lot less sales and a lot less listings coming on. However, that changed last summer and we are back to a normal market now."
Slower activity in the higher end of the market shows that buyers aren't willing to throw money at just anything - as they seemed to be doing in the boom times of 2007 - but prices are also staying firm.
Sotheby's International Realty agents Gregg and Mackenzie Close just set a record on Vancouver's East Side Wall Street neighbourhood with the sale of a waterfront property at $1.7-million. The house had been on the market for more than two years when it was priced at $1.950-million. It was relisted at $1.795 million and sold shortly after.
In West Vancouver, a 10-year-old, five-bedroom house that had been on the market since February at $4.2-million, recently sold for $3.55-million.
On Point Grey Road, Regent Park Realty agent Bryan Yan just completed the sale of an Arthur Erickson designed house that had sat on the market for nearly a year.
It was the first time the house had come up for sale since it was built in 1967, and the 2,300-square-foot house - small by new build standards - is in its original condition. It sits on a 33-by-130-foot lot that extends into the water, which is an unusual feature, says Mr. Yan. The house was listed high, he says, at $5.29-million. It sold for $4.7-million.
"It was a really tough sell. It's tiny. If it were done up, I would have sold it on day one," says Mr. Yan. "It was bought by a local buyer. I deal in lots in Point Grey, and a lot of them were bought by Asians before, and now it's more locals who are buying."
Mr. Yan, who's been a real estate agent in Vancouver for 20 years, says he knows the cycles. Buyers from mainland China will return after Chinese New Year on Jan. 31 to consider house purchases in Vancouver, and so he expects a bit of an increase in west side sales in February.
"Lower-priced entry-level detached homes everywhere in the Lower Mainland should go up in price this year by at least five to 10 per cent," he predicts. "Condo prices should remain flat for a long time because the local governments are letting developers rezone and build everywhere."
In central Coquitlam, homeowner Ria Lawson was surprised when her five-bedroom house sold two weeks after it was listed, in a bidding war that resulted in $10,000 above asking, for $735,000.
"Is the market hot? Not sure. I do know that if we listed too high we could have ended up getting no bites," she says.
"I was worried about that, especially going into December. If it ended up being too high, we would have had to de-list and then try again in February."
At the condo end of the market, which had softened the past couple of years, there's industry hope of a sales increase there as well. Bosa Properties vice-president Daryl Simpson says that's because of a shortage of new supply.
"The numbers we have show there are only 650 new concrete condo units in the inventory throughout Metro Vancouver," he says. "Some people might think that's a lot, but it's actually a small number.
"Certainly, some markets have more supply than others. Richmond had a lot of inventory last year - that was a market that we thought was over-supplied. But there were about 900 units absorbed last year, so the logjam broke.
"So, for 2014 we feel good. We feel better than we did in 2013. I would say for the majority of large-scale concrete builders in this market, I think that we are feeling relatively strong. The idea of a bubble and soft landing and all that is behind us."

Full text:   Manhattan architect Alexander Gorlin crafts a summer house of concrete and glass pavilions above the crashing Atlantic waves
Alexander Gorlin describes it as a primal site - all granite rocks and wild, crashing waves of the North Atlantic. It is what the Manhattan architect first saw several years ago, viewing it from a helicopter with his American client.
Inspired immediately by the starkness of the Nova Scotian scenery, Mr. Gorlin knew exactly what he wanted to build there: "The landscape was sublime and awesome ... a 10 on the Richter scale," he said in a recent interview. "Nevertheless, the scale of the site could be easily overwhelmed by a large monolithic house, so I decided to divide it up into pavilions to fit into the landscape of boulders and mini-ponds on the granite shelf."
The result is a stunning 6,000-square-foot waterfront home near Ketch Harbour, a picturesque seaside community just 25 minutes from Halifax and about 40 minutes from the airport. The house is a series of concrete and glass pavilions that soar above the rocks; their curved roofs are both practical and dramatic. They repel the water from the ocean storms as Mr. Gorlin pays homage to the fluttering sails of ships, new and old.
He explains the curtain of glass that fronts each of the pavilions is designed to "frame the view of the different aspects of the site" - the horizon of the ocean, the container ships along the Halifax shipping lanes, the summer parade of yachts destined for Chester on the province's South Shore, a historic lighthouse and a Second World War bunker once used to spot enemy ships.
Inside, the three bedroom and four-and-a-half bathroom home features minimal furnishings and a colour palette of whites and greys (with a few splashes of colour) that work in harmony with the landscape. The floors are Bulgarian limestone, which was shipped first to Italy for processing. The drawers in the all-white kitchen are equipped with individual motors so that they slide open effortlessly with just one touch. Although there is air-conditioning throughout, the great rooms are equipped with industrial-looking and energy efficient "big ass fans."
But as stark as is the landscape around it, so are the memories for its owner, an international tax attorney from Georgia. Sadly, he has never been able to enjoy it - two years before its completion his wife died suddenly.
"I need to put that behind me," says the owner, who asked that his name not be used, explaining why it is now up for sale. At $6.7-million, it is the most expensive listing in Nova Scotia and is featured prominently in the February issue of Architectural Digest.
The couple, who have a daughter, had planned this as their retirement home. For them, it had been a shared adventure and a labour of love.
Well before they found the land, however, they found Mr. Gorlin. "We were into simplicity and ... a modern design that emphasized the property and not so much the ornamentation of a house," says the owner.
Mr. Gorlin's portfolio is vast and varied - from office buildings to apartments to private homes and affordable housing. He trained with renowned architect I.M. Pei, who designed the Louvre Pyramid. He was inspired early on by the designs of Frank Lloyd Wright - "For his lessons in how to build in harmony with nature," he says. Louis Kahn, another American architect, provides inspiration, he says, "for his honest use of materials and how they join together."
Looking to escape the cloying humidity of Georgia spring and summers, the couple began thinking about buying along the coast of Maine coast, imagining cool ocean breezes. A friend, however, suggested Canada and its eastern coast, where they could buy acres of coastline for the cost of an acre in Maine.
Research brought them to Ketch Harbour where they purchased 40 acres of land, including 1,800 feet of ocean front, for $1.2-million. The property is bordered by 1,400 acres of Crown land. Privacy is what the owners were searching for - but not complete isolation.
For the architect, this was his first commission in Canada - and a great experience. (He says he even ended up making good friends with a Ketch Harbour family, who lent him their boat to view the site. "I love Canada," says Mr. Gorlin.) He provided a number of different plans to the owners and to his surprise, he said, they went with the "most daring of the plans." Over five years - not much work could be done in the winter, given the elements - the home took shape.
"The challenging climate of the site with its sea spray and wild changes in temperature demanded a bold approach to construction," explained Mr. Gorlin, who had wanted to use the rock from the site to build the home, but that proved too expensive. So they simplified, choosing concrete, a special glass window system that was tested for its resilience and roofs with a zinc covering.
Mr. Gorlin makes special mention of local builder Andrew Watts, who has previously built on the ocean.
"By framing the views in multiple directions with concrete piers and high vaults it's like a kaleidoscope of ocean, sky and rock," Mr. Gorlin said. "I was there recently and the full moon rose over the ocean, reflected not only in the tidal pools but refracted the glass walls of the house. It was unbelievable how the architecture multiplied the effect of earth, sea and sky, a perfect balance of nature and geometry and harmony with each other."

Full text:   University students uncover some juicy neighbourhoods you may have passed over
cireland@globeandmail.com
A McMaster University professor recently handed his urban geography class an interesting assignment: Uncover Toronto neighbourhoods where a new resident would find just the right mix of lifestyle and value.
Prof. Richard Harris asked students to find the ideal community for a hypothetical big sister returning from a stint in Hong Kong. He sent me a batch of the resulting essays after reading a column of mine last year about a real-life reader who was moving from San Francisco to Toronto and wanted advice on choosing a neighbourhood.
House hunters boxed in by preconcieved notions of Toronto's "best" neighbourhoods may find the student's outlook refreshing as we head into the busy spring real estate market. Stuck on High Park? Why not think Milliken instead? Or South Riverdale? Or the Yonge/Church corridor?
Prof. Harris, who teaches in the School of Geography and Earth Sciences, urged the students to exercise their creativity but they all started with a few details about the fictional ex-patriate: She grew up in Brantford, Ont., attended Mac, and has a job lined up in Toronto at a salary of $90,000 a year. She married while working in Hong Kong and her husband will be looking for work.
Prof. Harris advised the students to describe the couple's ages, ethnicities, immigrant status, lifestyle and commuting preferences, plans for having children or not, and political inclinations.
The professor also spoke to personal finance columnist Rob Carrick about an assignment for a different class looking at whether a potential buyer should rent or purchase a home in the current market.
For the most recent assignment, Emily Codlin introduces a socially and environmentally responsible young couple named Paul and Meg. Meg makes a high salary as a professional and Paul is a yoga instructor and practising Buddhist. They prefer to shop in locally owned businesses and seek out free-trade and organic goods.
Ms. Codlin's research led her to recommend South Riverdale as the target community for this married couple.
The neighbourhood contains diverse communities such as Riverside, East Chinatown, Leslieville, Port Lands and the Studio District, she says.
She points to the noticeable lack of big box stores, good supply of vegetarian-friendly restaurants and a high score for walkability.
According to a study by the University of Toronto, the real strength of the Riverdale area is its uniquely caring and concerned community, Ms. Codlin says. That means local agencies have no shortage of volunteers and residents are committed to fighting for social justice.
For Paul, a growing number of yoga studios offer job prospects and there's a Buddhist centre within cycling distance.
Compared to other neighbourhoods so close to downtown, the average property price in South Riverdale is relatively low. She notes that the average selling price in 2012 was $509,848 and compares that number to earlier years to support her view that there is a trend toward increasing affluence. She also points out that it's possible that the neighbourhood's industrial past dampens real estate values: problems with lead contamination and air and water pollution are improving but not completely eradicated.
Ms. Codlin figures Meg and Paul will enjoy life in South Riverdale, with its affordable housing, commitment to social action and ideal location between downtown and the beach.
Another student, Nicole Gamble, undertakes the search on behalf of 20-somethings Rachel and Tony.
She narrows the choice down to the three adjoining areas known as the Danforth , Gerrard-Coxwell and Blake-Jones , clustered in the East End. The Danforth is a band of streets north of the Bloor-Danforth subway line, while the other two areas lie south of the subway line.
Ms. Gamble characterizes the areas as having easy access to downtown, medium density housing with a mix of types, a mixture of incomes and high walkability.
Tony has experience as a financial analyst so this fictional couple has a little more to spend. They also are likely willing to rent for a little while in order to save up some money. An area that includes a Chinese community is ideal but not essential.
The areas Ms. Gamble recommends have a mix of non-official mother tongue languages, including Greek, Italian and Cantonese.
The area comprised of the three neighbourhoods is a fairly multicultural community. There's a sizable Muslim population but other notable demographics as well, including small-but-significant Cantonese-speaking populations in each of these neighbourhoods.
Also, the area offers a mix of housing types and average prices ranged between $400,00 and $500,000 in 2012. That gives the couple more options if they decide to purchase, points out Ms. Gamble.
The area satisfies their transit and service accessibility priorities without reaching prohibitively high levels of housing costs. She also hopes that if they invest in the community soon, they will be able to benefit from its increasing gentrification in the future. While slightly elevated crime rates make the area somewhat less attractive, this is balanced out by other factors that suit their tastes.
In Sandra Paccanaro's scenario, Jennifer and Raymond are a married couple in their late 20s who have decided to rent rather than own.
They want to be mobile for another three to five years before they have children. They would like to be in an apartment complex for easy living. They are coming from Hong Kong, where they adopted the high level of consumerism that is associated with young, professional intellectual elite.
Belonging to a distinct Chinese or multicultural community is welcomed but is not as important as being in a more socially affluent neighbourhood.
Ms. Paccanaro points the young couple toward the Church-Yonge corridor . The area is between Yonge and Jarvis streets, bordered by Bloor to the north and Front to the south.
Ms. Paccanaro figures Jennifer and Raymond will like the lively gay village within the neighbourhood.
Arts and entertainment are also plentiful, and the Eaton Centre is close by. They also value their leisure time and being able to move around the city easily on transit is important to them.
The Church-Yonge corridor area is undergoing rejuvenation and the density is increasing. Many more condominium towers are on the drawing board.
"Jennifer and Raymond want to be surrounded by people their own age and have a genuine work ethic, like themselves."
Elizabeth Burns also seeks out a neighbourhood for a couple in their late twenties. In this case, Andrea and Kevin are both politically liberal and would like to live with couples and families who share their Chinese ethnicity.
Ms. Burns has selected Milliken , Ont. as the ideal location.
This suburban area bordering Markham is bounded by Steeles Avenue, Markham Road east of Kennedy Road and north of Finch Avenue.
About 50 per cent of the population speaks Cantonese, Chinese or Mandarin.
The lower-income neighbourhood is a good fit, she says, because the couple will be out of the city but still able to associate with people of a similar culture.
High-scoring academic schools are also in the neighbourhood.
Geoff Rose wrote about his imaginary sister Rachel and her husband Ri, who prefer to live near nature and don't want a home that is too demanding of their time. They love walking and cycling and dislike all motorized vehicles.
Mr. Rose asked them to rank their preferences on a range of attributes that they might find in a neighbourhood. He found that they value good housing above all, with lack of crime, transit and shopping, entertainment, walkability, diversity and proximity to work following in that order.
Mr. Rose recommends that the couple rent a place in Kensington Market . He warns of the risk of a correction in the housing market. He also cites a McMaster prof's thesis that it's often better to rent than buy due to generally better returns from other investments and the propensity for homeowners to spend more freely.
Kensington Market is a very multicultural community, Mr. Rose points out. More than 15 per cent of the residents speak Mandarin or Cantonese.
The market is also a "walker's paradise" with loads of coffee shops, bars and restaurants. Theatres, museums or art galleries are all close by. Transit links are also good.
The level of crime is one area in which Kensington Market's score is a bit diminished, says Mr. Rose, but he points out that illegal activity tends to run to break-and-enters, assaults and drug-related charges. More serious crimes such as sexual assaults, robberies and murders are not common compared with other, more dangerous neighbourhoods.
The lack of green space also detracts from the appeal a bit.
Still, Kensington Market offers lots of character, with writers and artists in residence and a large and busy Chinatown replete with Chinese food and goods of all kinds.
For his assignment, Bowen Lin zeroed in on the neighbourhood of Don Mills . He believes it would suit his fictional subject, Joanne, and her husband, Leslie (Tang Yu) Chow, who expect to earn good salaries but live frugally. They are also fitness enthusiasts and grew up in families that often vote Liberal.
Don Mills offers a prosperous environment with plenty of public and private schools, Mr. Lin says. The immigrants of Don Mills are primarily from Asia, which should suit the couple well because they share this lineage. Compared with other areas of Toronto, a high percentage of the immigrants know English and/or French, according to Mr. Lin's research.
The area provides plenty of walking trails and parkland, including Moccasin Trail Park, Duncairn Park, Southwell Park, Mallow Park, Talwood Park and Tottenham Park.
The crime rate is one of the lowest in the city, he adds, though break-and-enters do occur more often than in some parts.
Initially, the couple may face a long and time-consuming commute to downtown but that should get better because plans are in place to improve bike lanes and transit services.

Abstract: "In the North, recruiting is a challenge," says Mr. [Fadil Memedi], 55, who owns the shop with partner Rami Kassem, 34. The main problem is that in a town where many resource industry jobs pay very well, it is hard to hang on to staff in service industries. "We can't really compete with the wages of a diamond mine or gold field or anything like that," he said.

Full text:   The pressures and angst of entrepreneurship run deep in Canada's Far North, where a host of unique challenges complicate life for small-business operators.
Logistics are cumbersome, energy costs are sky high, and rents often exceed those in the biggest cities of southern Canada.
At the same time, the local market is small because of the sparse population, and any attempts to sell goods and services to customers in southern Canada can mean onerous shipping costs.
But that hasn't stopped the entrepreneurs in northern Canada from forging ahead, from the urban environments of Whitehorse and Yellowknife to the tiniest hamlets in the farthest reaches of Nunavut. One thing they share is determination, and a flexibility to try new things and add new ventures to keep the cash flowing.
Various entrepreneurs from southern Canada have relocated and started ventures in the North. And many Inuit - with their long history of self-sufficiency from living off the land - have now jumped into the business scene.
Independent companies are crucial to the North's economy. While almost 3,300 small businesses are active across the three territories, Statistics Canada says, there are only about 60 medium-sized and large ones.
But financing can be a stumbling block for small startups. "Conventional sources of risk capital - such as venture capital, angel investors and institutional investors - are non-existent," said Ken Toner, chief executive officer of Atuqtuarvik Corp., an investment firm that supports ventures in Nunavut. Atuqtuarvik was seeded with land claim funds in 2000, and now lends money and takes equity stakes in Inuit-owned companies in the territory.
Atuqtuarvik ensures that Inuit entrepreneurs are able to get involved in the development of the mineral industry, fisheries and real estate, as well as other small-business ventures - while ensuring that the profits stay in the territory, Mr. Toner said.
Other business development organizations in Nunavut, the Yukon and Northwest Territories provide grants, loans and startup capital to small and mid-sized firms.
By supporting northern ventures, these agencies ensure that people in the region can participate in the economic development of the North, while respecting the environment and the traditional lifestyles in the region.
At the same time, new technologies, from PayPal to Twitter, have helped northern entrepreneurs overcome the vast distances and even sell their goods far beyond the local market.
Here are some of their stories:
Jackie Milne, Hay River, Northwest Territories:
Jackie Milne, owner of Indian Summers Market Garden and Greenhouse, insists the opportunities for entrepreneurs in the North outweigh the disadvantages - even for a farmer.
"You have to be creative and use your imagination," she said. "You need to have the courage to try."
Ms. Milne, 47, has a three-acre market farm on the outskirts of Hay River, a town of almost 4,000 people on the south side of Great Bear Lake. Local residents are very keen for fresh food, she has found.
Indeed, there is very little local competition. "Practically 100 per cent of [Hay River's] food is imported," she said, and the cost is very high. "I can sell natural, organic, chemical-free produce for the same price as the regular generic stuff. I am getting a really good price, but the public is getting a superior product."
She was born in Hay River, but left at age 19 and moved to Vancouver Island, where she started farming. When she and her husband - a heavy equipment mechanic - moved back north 17 years later, she began a garden, saw how well it prospered, and decided to get back into farming.
Food can grow well in parts of the North. Once insulating peat moss is removed, the permafrost melts and, after a couple of years of warming, the soil is very productive in the long days of summer, Ms. Milne said.
She focuses on crops that do well in cool weather, and eschews heat-loving ones such as tomatoes and cucumbers. Vegetables such as cabbage, broccoli and cauliflower can thrive in cooler weather, as do potatoes, carrots, spinach, lettuce and kale. In the summer, plants grow significantly faster than in southern Canada, and without heat stress. Another advantage: The number of pests is far lower in the North. "I have the most pristine organic carrots, because we don't have the carrot rust fly," she said.
Ms. Milne has built a super-insulated solar green house to grow crops in winter, heating it with a high-tech "gasification" burner that consumes wood extremely efficiently.
Tia and Leslie Nukiwuak, Qikiqtarjuaq, Nunavut:
Tia and Leslie Nukiwuak have their eye on expansion, despite the fact that their business is based in a tiny settlement of about 500 people on the north coast of Baffin Island.
Their company, Leelie Enterprises, owns a retail store in town, handles fuel delivery, and provides guiding and outfitting services. It also owns a bed and breakfast in Iqaluit, more than 500 kilometres away.
"The key to our success is diversity," Ms. Nukiwuak said. "We keep our eyes and ears open for opportunities, and if there are no opportunities, we make our own."
Tia, 46, is originally from Southern Ontario, and she met her husband Leslie, 66, when she moved to Qikiqtarjuaq to teach. She wanted to get out of teaching, and Leslie, an Inuit who grew up on the land, recognized that there were business opportunities in outfitting hunting and fishing expeditions. "Leslie's vision was to keep both of us locally employed and hire as many other local residents as possible to offer employment opportunities amongst his people," Tia said.
The company has managed to extend the tourism season beyond the short summer window by helping entice clients to come north in September and October. It may be colder then, but that's the time when wildlife is on the move, and it is much more likely to catch a glimpse of a bear or other animals.
The couple constantly reinvest in the business. At the moment, they are looking at buying a small plane to allow them to travel between communities and bring in clients as well as supplies.
The company has eight full-time employees at the moment, but high staff turnover is one of the biggest challenges. The best way to keep people, Ms. Nukiwuak said, is to be as flexible as possible. Inuit employees want to go hunting on the land on occasion, so it is important to give them time off and make contingency plans, she said.
Bob Baxter, Whitehorse, Yukon:
In the mid-1990s, Bob Baxter and his friend Alan Hansen were sitting around the campfire on a canoe trip on the Jennings River in the Yukon when they came up with the idea of starting a brewery in the North. The two engineers, who both originally hail from Southern Ontario, finally brought their dream to fruition in 1997. Today, their Yukon Brewing Co. makes the most popular draft beer in the territory, but sells 35 per cent of its brew in British Columbia, Alberta and even some international markets.
The biggest challenge is the small size of the local market, Mr. Baxter said. "The entire Yukon has 35,000 people in it. We knew off the bat that the only way we would ever survive is to rely on exports out of the Yukon."
But selling to those unfamiliar with an obscure brand was tough initially, he says. "We learned pretty quickly that you are only the home team at home. When you go somewhere else, it is hard to get noticed." Still, the brewery has taken advantage of the sheer "exoticness" of its locale as a key marketing strategy, Mr. Baxter said.
Financing was tough at the start, although government loans helped get the business launched, Mr. Baxter said. Most banks were reluctant to lend, but more than two dozen local residents put up cash to buy shares.
Logistics can be tough for a company making a commodity such as beer in an out-of-the-way location such as Whitehorse, but the brewery has overcome those challenges. Mr. Baxter said. Water comes from local sources, hops are fairly easy to ship in, and grain comes up the highway via truck at a reasonable cost. The company also invested in a special washer, so it can recycle bottles locally.
Now, Yukon Brewing is getting ready to tap into a new market. The company bought a still in 2009 and has starting making whisky. After a few more years of barrel aging, it will be ready to sell. "I have no idea how the whisky market works," Mr. Baxter, 57, admits, but he's going to give it a try.
His advice to other northern entrepreneurs? "Be stubborn. Refuse to fail."
Fadil Memedi, Yellowknife, Northwest Territories:
For Fadil Memedi, co-owner of the Javaroma coffee shop in Yellowknife, the biggest challenge in owning a small business in the North is finding and keeping employees.
"In the North, recruiting is a challenge," says Mr. Memedi, 55, who owns the shop with partner Rami Kassem, 34. The main problem is that in a town where many resource industry jobs pay very well, it is hard to hang on to staff in service industries. "We can't really compete with the wages of a diamond mine or gold field or anything like that," he said.
Still, Mr. Memedi has been fortunate to attract people who heard about Javaroma from others who worked there in the past, and liked the atmosphere. Those word-of-mouth referrals have gleaned him several employees over the years. His current workers include locals as well as people originally from the Philippines, Japan and Ethiopia.
There are many other challenges. Shipping costs are a big expense, since Javaroma gets most of its supplies from Montreal, and it's costly to transport them all that way. Rent is also substantially higher in the North than in equivalent locations in southern Canada.
With financing tough to get in the food business, Mr. Mamedi tapped the nest egg he built up when he ran a taxi business in Yellowknife before buying Javaroma four years ago. "I managed to put a little bit away and I've got a partner who did the same thing."
Mr. Memedi was born in Macedonia, lived in New York for a time, then ran an Italian restaurant in Pickering, Ont., before a couple of friends in Yellowknife suggested he try moving there, partly because he liked outdoor activities. He moved in the mid-1990s and has been there ever since.
There are advantages of operating in a small northern city, Mr. Memedi says. Yellowknife's isolation makes it feel almost like a village, so after a while "you do know just about everybody," he said. If a business creates a good impression, word travels fast.
And despite the remote location, a trendy coffee shop can bring in celebrities. Duchess of York Sarah Ferguson dropped by Javaroma a few years ago while filming a reality television series in the North, and the stars of the TV series Ice Road Truckers have come by on occasion, Mr. Memedi said.
Vicki Aitaok, Cambridge Bay, Nunavut:
In Cambridge Bay, a hamlet of about 1,500 people on the southeast coast of Victoria Island, Vicki Aitaok, 50, and her husband Jorgan, 46, run Arctic Closet, a gift, clothing and craft shop.
It is tough to make a living as an entrepreneur in a small isolated community, Ms. Aitaok acknowledges, given the tiny market and high expenses. "There is only so much money to go around" in a town of this size, she said. "That is just the reality."
While there is government financing available for Inuit-owned firms, Ms. Aitaok and her husband have tried to make the company viable without that help. "We want it to be self-sustaining," she said.
The Arctic Closet store is breaking even, but not generating much of a profit, so the couple have tried to diversify into other areas. They recently opened a second branch at the town's airport terminal, and added coffee and food service at that location.
"The only way we have been able to manage is to diversify and broaden into other areas," she said. The new airport location, for instance, gives the business exposure to a different clientele, including people who are changing planes but not staying in the community.
The couple have also started up an eco-tours business, and Ms. Aitaok does some part-time contract teaching to help make ends meet. She first went north in her 20s as a teacher - she was born in Saskatchewan - and met her husband, who is Inuit, in Cambridge Bay.
She also organizes the town's efforts when Arctic cruise ships come to town each year and passengers get off to look around. Ms. Aitaok co-ordinates activities at Cambridge Bay's cultural centre - along with local artisans and elders, taxi companies and retailers - so the visitors get a more coherent experience. The town, of course, benefits from everything the visitors spend, and it helps buoy all the small businesses involved.
The combination of the natural entrepreneurial tendencies of the Inuit, with the backing from new institutions that provide financial support, bodes well for small business in the North, she said.

Full text:   Despite its prospering residents, revolving-door retail with lack of quaint character is adding to commercial area's slow decline
In her classic novel To Kill A Mockingbird , author Harper Lee describes a small, tired village: "There's nowhere to go and nothing to buy ... and no money".
Ms. Lee's characterization could've been about a short two-block stretch of retail and restaurants that intersects the Forest Hill neighbourhood - except for the "no money" part. Surrounded by a half-dozen shuttered shops, misplaced franchises and a host of once grand-looking low-rise apartment buildings, there remains a few lone witnesses to a time when Forest Hill Village resembled a Norman Rockwell painting.
For more than half a century, the Village was a charming pastiche that served the prospering neighbourhood with folksy proprietary stores that were rich in service and quality. A snapshot of street life in the 1940s looked like a still from a Frank Capra movie. The Village featured gourmet food shops, two gas stations with mechanics you could trust, one of the original Loblaw stores, a movie theatre and a candy-filled Stop and Shop variety store. Cut to present day, and the same village is suffering from a slow rot evident in revolving-door retail and the lack of quaint architectural character that once defined the Village so many years earlier.
The Forest Hill Barber Shop opened its doors in 1931 and its owner, Nick Vitantonio, 71, has been cutting hair for more than 50 years. On the day I dropped into the shop, the question I posed about the stagnant state of Forest Hill Village immediately turned off the heated debate over Habs versus Leafs.
Mr. Vitantonio is fast to offer his opinion on why this prime stretch of real estate, surrounded by the glitz and glamour of its residents, has never morphed into the kind of distinctive streetscape that defines Toronto in neighbourhoods such as Rosedale, Leslieville and Roncesvalles.
"You can't call it a village anymore when all you have is franchises, banks and chain stores we don't need. Where is the butcher shop, the post office or a quality grocery?" he says. His son-in-law, Terry Caris, who works alongside Mr. Vitantonio, adds: "No one wants Rodeo Drive, but the Village is now famous for gouging rent and thousands of parking tickets. What's charming about that?"
Forest Hill dates back to 1923, when it was incorporated as a village, and later annexed by the City of Toronto in 1967. In spite of a derailed attempt to construct a highway that would run from the 401 to downtown Toronto via Spadina Road - which would have destroyed the Village - Forest Hill quickly became one of the most affluent neighbourhoods in Toronto. It boasts two of Toronto's most prestigious schools and houses that sell for $4- to $5-million. While many consider Rosedale to be the setting of Toronto's elite, Forest Hill has been home at one time to many of the city's great moguls, including the Weston and Rogers families.
Veteran realtor Roman Gofman, who has been selling big-ticket real estate in the neighbourhood for nearly 30 years, says the Village lost its identity years ago. "The landlords charge sky-high rents while they wait for zoning for redevelopment or another franchisor with deep pockets," he says.
He also points to a sad stretch of the Village featuring four dilapidated storefronts that have been boarded up for nearly a decade, and fast-food outlets and retailers who come to the neighbourhood without understanding the demographics and quickly fail.
"Did the Village need a Baskin Robbins when we had a great local ice-cream shop? Do we really need a Subway?" Mr. Gofman asks. "Did we need a Blockbuster across from a local video store? All of this contributes to a lack of individuality and drives people to shop elsewhere."
Enter Peter McClelland, the chairman of the Forest Hill BIA. He has watched over the Village for the past decade and is trying to improve things. Mr. McClelland agrees that the state of retail could be much better. "The Village is a double-edged sword with name brands that don't work and excessive rent that can't support bespoke retailers. The residents don't want a Nike or Roots store. We have to be patient, find the balance and be realistic. This village is in transition. Things will change."
Another concern is that large retailers that can afford the rent often lack the vision to create something that reflects the history of the Forest Hill Village. Mr. Gofman points to the newest addition to the strip, a large LCBO store. It's a box-like structure with the architectural sparkle of a munitions plant in Kabul. Both Mr. Gofman and Mr. McClelland agree that this was a stunning mistake. "Both the builder and the LBCO had an opportunity to produce something special," Mr. Gofman says. "It would've been wonderful to create an homage to The Village Movie Theatre that was located on that same spot 40 years ago."
In the growing age of the multiplex, the theatre was closed and the location eventually became a dry cleaner before being torn down to make room for the LCBO outlet. Curiously, in a neighbourhood that has many great private cellars, this LCBO features a miniscule Vintages section with fewer than a dozen bottles. "Why they didn't build something similar to the iconic Summerhill location, or make the whole store a Vintages, is staggering," said one of the managers on duty on the day I visited, who didn't want to be identified.
"The district manager is reviewing the situation," he says.
With only two blocks to consider, residents and the BIA could work together to enforce a building code and install distinctive street lighting. Instead, the street is poorly lit by tall industrial lighting and a mess of hugely tacky signs that promote everything from a massage therapist to cold beer.
Lionel Schipper was just a young boy when he first lived in Forest Hill in the '40s, before moving south of St. Clair years later. He recalls a different kind of place. He paints a vivid canvas that had the movie theatre where he watched weekly sneak previews, a friendly local gas station to fill bike tires each summer, and the Min-A-Mart bakery where his mother bought chocolates and a pint of ice cream.
"It was a bustle of activity and a destination," Mr. Schipper says. "I still love it, but it's sad that it's not what it should be."
The past decade has seen an exodus of many distinctive retailers such as the Genoa Butcher Shop, Irwin's Hardware shop and Paul's French Foods. Also long-departed are restaurants such as Primi, Sotto In the Village, Hope Street Cafe, and the Village Diner, where Mr. Schipper feasted on fried egg sandwiches as a child.
Mr. McClelland is aiming to execute a master plan to bring back some of the Village's lost character. "I can't control the landlords, but I can focus on improving the streetscape," he says. His plans include building out the patios, tree planting and the recent addition of a $500,000 park that he says will act as a gateway to the Village. The BIA is also trying to mediate a debate on how best to solve the parking issue. Residents are divided on a plan to turn the lone, small parking lot into a multilevel structure with retail.
Mr. Gofman thinks the parking issue is irrelevant. "Local residents have long abandoned the Village for retailers like Pusateri's north of the Village, or the shops on Eglinton Avenue where there is plenty of parking. These are people that shop in New York and Palm Beach. What are we offering?"
Damir Sulejmani and his brother Izzy have been retailers in the Village for 18 years. Damir has tried to elevate the village retail experience by using his modest-sized gallery and framing shop to feature iconic photographers such as Albert Watson, Mary McCartney and Lillian Bassman. But he says the Village is its own obstacle. "Residents have to speak up and demand a standard for the Village. Big-box retailers and franchises should not be allowed [here].
"The BIA thinks that dropping in a few metal benches makes a village a village. Ridiculous! The $500,000 spent on a park no one is using could've been spent on street banners, festivals and better parking."
Mr. Caris agrees: "Mom and Pop have been replaced with corporations. We are a high-end neighbourhood with a lot of low-end stuff."
And yet, this is hardly a desolate strip. On any day, the Village is alive with animated chatter outside coffee shops and there is a steady stream of traffic. You can easily identify the savvy retailers who have figured out what works. The handsomely expanded Track Fitness and Aroma Espresso Bar are jam-packed, as is the Kitchen Table grocery store. Hands-on veteran restaurateurs such as Banfi, Mashu Mashu and Edo have prospered, offering personal attention and a consistent menu tailored to the neighbourhood.
Aside from Mr. Vitantonio, the barber, a few old-time players such as the Village Chill ice cream shop also give the strip some much-needed character, and a few new additions like the Type book store and Apotheca drug store aspire to transform the street.
But, as Mr. Sulejmani says, locals want more. "We can't survive with a village that offers exercise and coffee."

White Rock catches the developer's eye

Abstract: With White Rock's traditionally quirky architecture - partly a result of a federal mandarin who planned the town a century ago regardless of its steep topography, plopping down "Elgin" and "Oxford" streets on practically vertical slopes - one can understand the community's fears about creeping gentrification. Still, the signs were there - really as soon as the Hells Angels clubhouse relocated to Langley more than a decade ago.

Full text:   The quirky, laid-back community is drawing interest even as it attempts to both densify and keep its small-town feel
This sleepy 20,000-person enclave south of Vancouver that began life as a resort area for city folk is becoming a real estate hot spot.
While change comes slowly to this community of mainly elderly retirees, you know something is afoot when the CBC's Kevin O'Leary pronounces it the next big thing. And just at the moment when its brave new experiment in urban-style densification - seemingly at odds with its largely small town feel - is bearing fruit.
In the new "uptown centre" area - a two block radius north of the beach, Miramar Village - two 21- and 19-storey towers by Bosa that achieved rezoning approval in 2008 and were completed in 2010 - was followed by the Avra (Greek for "sea breeze") - an Epta Properties 17-storey tower that was finished last April.
A handful of similar projects are in the works, including the Saltaire - its first phase, a five-storey wood-framed building, to be followed by a tower.
While this kind of densification may seem mild by Vancouver standards, in White Rock it caused quite a stir, with vociferous community opposition to the first tower, since quelled by amenity contributions and somewhat stringent aesthetic guidelines. In addition to landscaping around towers, the dominant theme of the moment is a sort of benign "West Coast contemporary."
But with White Rock's traditionally quirky architecture - partly a result of a federal mandarin who planned the town a century ago regardless of its steep topography, plopping down "Elgin" and "Oxford" streets on practically vertical slopes - one can understand the community's fears about creeping gentrification. Still, the signs were there - really as soon as the Hells Angels clubhouse relocated to Langley more than a decade ago.
At present, the beachfront area still looks like a scene from Robin Williams's Popeye (actually shot in Malta), and has, in fact, been a cinematic stand-in for a number of Mediterranean locales. But fears that its eccentric mix of art deco, beach shacks and California-inspired architecture along Marine Drive might get bulldozed are soothed by the fact that because the lots are so narrow and shallow, it's more cost effective for owners to keep running the plethora of fish-and-chip shops and eateries than build new condos.
But with the average 500-square-foot beach shack on an 1,800-square-foot lot going for $599,000 (basically lot value) and a controversial new condo development just west of restaurant row, some long-time residents are concerned.
"The trick" of balancing new development while keeping White Rock's character intact, says Mayor Wayne Baldwin, "is to rein in multi-family dwellings and protect the single-family areas." At the same time, he sees the necessity of more development as land values soar and the population increases. The community plan envisions a build out of up to a population of 30,000 by the year 2030, with a 70/30 split, respectively, between multi-family and single-family units, whose current ratio is closer to 50/50.
"We're running out of land," says Mayor Baldwin, "so we have to build up."
While areas such as Five Corners - just south of City Hall - saw late 1980s mixed-use development successfully maintained by an active retail sector, it's now the new "uptown centre" area that will bear the brunt of a more intensive densification.
Meanwhile, the market seems to support the push to densify, with Avra 80 per cent sold, says developer Chris Tsakumis of Epta Properties, and 60 per cent of the Sausalito development near the beach already snatched up.
There are many young families here, Mr. Tsakumis says. "White Rock isn't just about retirees and lottery-home winners. It's a real, developing community."
But the main drivers, he says, are "early empty nesters and Chinese buyers."
Indeed, the rush to buy property in White Rock and neighbouring South Surrey, says local Sutton Group Realtor Jin Ye, is on par with Richmond's popularity in the late nineties. Mayor Baldwin recalls daily helicopter flights during the past year - Asian buyers circling potential properties. But since White Rock only offers five square kilometres of land, many Asian buyers are choosing neighbouring South Surrey.
The area appeals to them, says Mr. Ye, for many reasons - including the sunny, mild climate (it rains less than in Vancouver), proximity to the airport and the fact that many properties are almost a third of the price of West Side Vancouver real estate. But also primary is the proximity of many excellent schools, including ones with the IB (international baccalaureate) and French immersion programs.
While many of Mr. Ye's clients who bought in the Avra, for instance, are offshore investors, the majority have their families reside in White Rock, while they work in China.
"This is a good place to spend money, not to make it," observes the Beijing-born Realtor, who has sold many properties in the $5-million range to Chinese buyers over the past few years. And, in a way, there is a strange kind of continuity to this phenomenon, as White Rock was originally a vacation spot where families would spend summers, while breadwinners would work in Vancouver and visit on weekends.
Mr. Ye points out a White Rock waterfront lot with a tear down that is currently listed for $2-million more than it sold for two years ago. New homes with a decidedly modernist bent are going up every month in tony West White Rock, with the likes of a new Olson Kundig house in concrete, glass and stone a sobering contrast to some of the more colourful 1970s and 1980s residences. Clearly, this is a sought after area.
But it's nearby Elgin and Chantrelle Heights in South Surrey that have become de facto Chinese communities. Here, large acreages with colonial gates - once home to self-styled suburban-landed gentry - now house families from Shanghai and Beijing. On 28th street, points out Mr. Ye, during a particularly frenzied month of sales when Realtors' signs dotted most of the landscape, someone put a sold sign on the street sign itself. Real estate installation art or local protest? Hard to know. As I contemplate the surrounding gigantus that is South Surrey, some 20 times its size and three times its population, I wonder, where will Kevin O'Leary build his house?

The latest condominium by Insoho Developments Corp. will embody a downtown development with a sleek, modern design and chic common areas. But its east-end address means buyers will be less likely to blow their budgets buying a home there.
"People looking to enter the marketplace and looking a little closer to the core can get a unit here at say 25 per cent less than five or 10 minutes west," says president, Ron Herczeg.
"[So] we're one of the more successful projects of 2013 - we opened in the fall and are 50 per cent sold - and we're right on schedule to break ground late spring/early summer."
Situated at the corner of Kennedy Road and St.Clair Avenue East, the four-storey residence, called Imagine Condos, will offer one-bedroom plans starting around $200,000.
"You can get a condo - a locker and a parking space included plus all the amenities of the building - under $400 a square foot," Mr. Herczeg said. "There are very few buildings, if any, that can say that."
The developer also wants buyers to make the best use of their money - and time - by moving them in beginning next fall.
"The difference with this building - being only 96 units in a mid-rise building - is the time frame from purchase to occupancy is 18 to 24 months, which makes it very appealing to end users," Mr. Herczeg said.
"A high-rise building in comparison has a five-year time frame."
This infill development is one of the few being built in the community.
"We've done numerous projects in Scarborough, so we know what are strong up-and-coming neighbourhoods," Mr. Herczeg said.
For instance, there is no shortage of transit nearby with a light rail line in the works and a Scarborough GO station, two TTC subway stations and nine-bus routes in operation.
"We're just south of ... Kennedy [station] ..., which is going to be a major transit hub," Mr. Herczeg said.
"[Presently] we have a tremendous amount of TTC access, plus it's across the street from the GO, which can take you downtown in about 20 to 25 minutes."
The suburban mix of natural and manufactured attractions is another lure to buyers. "Within five minutes of the site, you have Lake Ontario and the Bluffs just to the east of us, an amazing ravine and trail system that takes you downtown, and you're close to the Rouge provincial park," Mr. Herczeg said.
"[Plus] on Eglinton Avenue - between Victoria Park Avenue and Kennedy Road - there's a tremendous amount of new big box retail."
The selection of plans will be as diverse as the local landmarks they're named after, but will generally have open principal rooms with nine-foot ceilings, stainless steel kitchen appliances and master bathrooms, as well as expansive windows and balconies punctuating the European-inspired brick facade.
"We tried to bring a more urban, downtown feel to the Scarborough marketplace," Mr. Herczeg noted. "Typically, you wouldn't see that in the Scarborough marketplace with a lot of glass, oversized balconies and neat, contemporary architectural features in the building."
When residents need extra space or excitement, they will have access to a rooftop terrace, party and fitness facilities.
"Because of its mid-rise nature, we're able to bring the building in at a reasonable monthly maintenance fee of 37 cents per square foot," Mr. Herczeg added.

Full text:   Third month of mild sales declines seen as a 'healthy development' by those worried about overvaluation
REAL ESTATE REPORTER
Three consecutive months of mild declines suggest that Canada's housing market is slowly losing momentum, leading some observers to predict the soft landing that policy makers have been hoping for.
The number of homes changing hands continues to run higher than many economists expected, and prices even more so. That's driven by the comeback of cities that slumped the deepest in 2012, such as Vancouver and Toronto.
Sales remain strong, with December levels at 12.9 per cent above those of a year earlier, according to data released Wednesday by the Canadian Real Estate Association, which represents a majority of real estate agents in Canada.
But on a month-to-month basis, about 60 per cent of the Canadian markets saw a decline in sales from November. National sales slipped 1.8 per cent in December, the third consecutive monthly fall.
The modest slowdown since September is welcomed by many economists and policy makers who worry about overvaluation. Royal Bank of Canada economist Robert Hogue called it a "healthy development."
December's figures bring an end to a year that saw national sales rise 0.8 per cent, to 457,893 existing homes. That's a sharp contrast from the dire forecasts that the market would have a huge slump in 2013 in the wake of Ottawa's tightening of mortgage insurance rules in July 2012.
There was much speculation in the fall that the high number of national sales in August and September were stealing future sales, as prospective buyers rushed into the market, either because they feared that mortgage rates would rise further or to take advantage of rates they had locked in during the summer. That appears to be largely true.
The average price of homes that sold over the Multiple Listing Service in December, meanwhile, was up by 10.4 per cent from a year earlier to $389,119.
The MLS Home Price Index, which attempts to create a more apples-to-apples national comparison, was up 4.3 per cent. That's still strong, and marks a slight acceleration in price growth from the 4.11-per-cent annual gain in November.
The latest numbers indicate Mr. Flaherty's attempt to head off a bubble may have paid off, despite the fact his measures frustrated some.
Adam Chiasson, a 32-year-old Calgarian, for example, was finally able to move into his first house last month, having been put off by those changes.
"My down-payment wasn't really there at that point, so it kind of pissed me off for a little bit because it meant I had to save more," he said. "That pushed things back a little bit."
He went on to save up enough for a 20-per cent down-payment on a house worth more than $300,000, making him eligible to buy without mortgage insurance.
Calgary's sales were up 9 per cent from a year earlier. Mr. Chiasson says the house he bought was only on the market for about a day and a half.
Not all markets have fared well. Ottawa saw a 2.1-per-cent decline in sales from a year earlier, a phenomenon that local players say is largely related to government layoffs, which have been impacting the market for some time.
"I think we've been a little spoiled in the last five or seven years where you put a house on the market and expect it to be sold in a couple weeks," says Ottawa Re/Max agent Jeff Miller, who notes that houses have been taking closer to 50 days to sell in the last couple of months.
Kevin Williamson, a construction worker in Ottawa, listed his home about seven months ago. He and his wife wanted to move their seven kids, and the home daycare she runs, closer to schools.
"We didn't really have an offer until about six weeks ago," he said Wednesday, as he sat in the moving truck 'finally taking him to a new home. "We had listed at what we thought we'd get and we ended up dropping the price two or three times. But we didn't really mind, because everyone else was dropping their prices too."
Al Demings, a Re/Max agent in the Halifax-Dartmouth area, where sales fell 16.9 per cent last year, cited the differences across the country.
"The changes to the mortgage regulations that were made in order to stop what they thought was going to be a potential bursting of the bubble in Ontario and out west has had a pretty significant impact here, it limited our first-time buyers and that has a ripple effect," he said.
Mr. Demings is now letting himself hope that things are turning around. "I'm not sure if it's that we've finally got a nice couple of days here almost like summer, but we've had a higher turnout to open houses than we've had in months," he said Wednesday.
At the national level, economists are now expecting both sales and prices to tick up a small amount this year. Royal Bank's Mr. Hogue is calling for a 0.6-per-cent rise in sales and a 1.5-per-cent gain in prices.

Full text:   'Nick the Greek' was the driving force behind several Toronto film studios and counted Francis Ford Coppola among his friends
Today's thriving film and television industries in Toronto and Chicago owe a great deal to the impatience of Nikolaos (Nick the Greek) Mirkopoulos.
Trained as an electrician in Greece, Mr. Mirkopoulos had foresight and vision that far exceeded the parameters of his trade. He became an entrepreneur/developer with a particular interest in film production.
Mr. Mirkopoulos was the driving force behind Toronto's Cinespace Film Studios, the first large-scale movie-production facility in Canada. As soon as his project was completed in 1990, he was on to the next big thing, the development of three more studio complexes in Toronto. He was extremely proud that one of them, Marine Terminal 28, was the location for Chicago, the only film ever shot in Canada to win an Oscar for best picture (2005).
In a serendipitous connection after the Academy Award, the City of Chicago presented another opportunity to expand his burgeoning empire. The collapse of the U.S. real estate market in 2008, encouragement from nephews who lived in Chicago, plus eagerness of the city and Illinois to attract the studio developer responsible for their namesake movie led Mr. Mirkopoulos to undertake another ambitious project. By May, 2011, he had transformed an industrial lot into the largest sound stage for film in the United States (outside of California). Cinespace Chicago quickly became a hub of production that revitalized that city's film and television industry.
When the 71-year-old died from cancer on Dec. 7, Illinois Governor Pat Quinn issued this statement: "Mr. Mirkopoulos will be remembered for his daring and imagination. Not many business leaders would have seen opportunity in a 50-acre industrial site, but he built it into a film studio that put thousands of people to work and brought new business to Illinois."
Nick Mirkopoulos was born on Jan. 13, 1942, in the farming village of Kalochori in northern Greece. He was the oldest of five sons born to Theodoros Mirkopoulos, a Greek Orthodox priest, and his wife, Chrysoula. The family was close-knit and hard-working. Nick and his brothers helped their mother with farm work while their busy father attended to the needs of the villagers. Nick and his brothers went to the local three-room village school until Grade 6.
Although he would have liked to continue his education, family circumstances demanded that Nick earn a living. He attended a technical school in Leros, where he learned the electrical trade. Shortly after getting his diploma, he completed two years of compulsory military service then, at age 18, started his own contracting and electrical business. His timing was excellent as the Greek government was then engaged in bringing electricity to small villages, including his own.
In the mid-1960s Siemens hired Mr. Mirkopoulos to work in Germany, an experience that intensified his hunger for the larger world. Steve Mirkopoulos said of his brother: "He was always the uneasy type and looking for something different. He had a thirst to move on, to do something bigger."
Canada, it seemed to Nick Mirkopoulos, was the place to be.
He emigrated to Toronto in 1968, leaving behind a repressive political climate - a military coup had just taken place in Greece. He started Torontario Contractors, an institutional contracting business that specialized in renovating and restoring landmark buildings. In letters home he wrote enthusiastically about his new country, persuading two brothers to join him. Once they arrived, he insisted on supporting his youngest brother while he became proficient in English and got a university education. Eventually, all three brothers joined forces in Torontario, developing solid relationships with government officials. Their company restored and repurposed heritage structures across Ontario such as the Tudhope Carriage Factory and the city hall in Orillia.
Where other people saw wasteland, Nick Mirkopoulos saw opportunity. In the 1980s, a low Canadian dollar meant Toronto was an attractive location for U.S. producers to shoot movies, but studio space was small and limited. Mr. Mirkopoulos canvassed people in the film industry, inquiring what was needed in terms of electrical requirements, heating and air conditioning, and sound stages. When he informed his two brothers that they were purchasing an old 250,000-square-foot warehouse on Eastern Avenue and turning it into Cinespace, they thought he was unhinged, but their brother could be persuasive. The idea soon made sense. Studios that had been built from scratch had to charge accordingly, whereas the reconversion of existing space meant that prices could be more competitive.
Cinespace opened in 1990 and became an immediate success. The stocky, 5-foot-10 Nick Mirkopoulos, accompanied by his Jack Russell terrier, could be seen roaming the hallways, frequently talking on two phones at once. When film production slowed, he could call a director such as Francis Ford Coppola (the two men were friends) and urge him to shoot his next movie in Toronto.
Mr. Mirkopoulos was well connected in Hollywood and something of a genius when it came to making things happen, although not all his attempts worked out. A long-standing effort to set up film studios in Greece was a disappointment. Robert Peck, Canadian Ambassador to Greece, wrote via e-mail: "Nick communicated, to put it mildly, his frustration at what he saw as bureaucratic inertia. The minister in charge was not used to such straight talk and evidently not too amused. Nick sensed he might have been a little short on nuance and somewhat apologetically said to me: 'Ambassador, I am a gladiator, not a diplomat.'"
Movie producer Don Carmody (Chicago), who became friends with Nick Mirkopoulos, called him irrepressible. "Nothing got him down. I never saw him truly angry. He would have these, as I put it, Donald Duck tantrums about various and sundry people he thought had done him wrong, particularly the City of Toronto. He was not a fan of bureaucracy," Mr. Carmody said.
Composer and U of T professor Christos Hatzis, a close friend, recalled meeting Mr. Mirkopoulos for the first time at a restaurant on the Danforth where the musician was playing cocktail piano. Mr. Hatzis initially thought the Greek entrepreneur, with his unprepossessing clothes and tales of owning studio space, was crazy. "Nick regarded himself as proficient in neither English nor Greek yet he was an amazing storyteller," Mr. Hatzis recalled."He was a paradox."
According to Mr. Hatzis, the two men wouldn't have become friends without Mr. Mirkopoulos's persistence. Their relationship solidified when Mr. Mirkopoulos invited his new acquaintance to visit him at Cinespace. "The studio was still working out kinks," Mr. Hatzis said. "Nick was insanely busy dealing with all kinds of problems when he got a call from elderly Fred Beavis, a retired city councillor, who was having trouble with his washing machine. Nick said he would send one of his technicians but Mr. Beavis insisted that Nick was the only one who could fix it. I went with Nick to Mr. Beavis's house. It turned out that the washing machine was unplugged, but Nick would never tell him that and embarrass him. Afterward, when we were leaving, Nick said: 'Never forget the people who helped you on the way up.' It touched me deeply."
When it came to helping others, nothing was too much trouble for Mr. Mirkopoulos. During the big blackout of 2003, with several film productions under way, he commandeered his client's extra generators to ensure that production office staff at Marine Terminal 28 could continue working. His nephew Jim Mirkopoulos, who now runs the Toronto Cinespace, said the experience must have reminded his uncle of being a young electrician newly arrived in Toronto. "He was pulling cables all over the building, cigarette hanging out of his mouth and a big smile on his face," he recalls. "There wasn't a person I know of that Nick would turn away if they were in need."
Charities in the vicinity of both Cinespaces received financial assistance from Nick Mirkopoulos, students were never charged for space, and free accommodation in a building he owned was available to friends in need of support. The list of hospitals and university scholarships sponsored by him is a lengthy one.
Although he had a couple of long-term girlfriends, Mr. Mirkopoulos was too restless and preoccupied with work to settle down. He owned several antique cars that were used in movies; yet, his own cars tended to be either beaters or rentals.
Material displays of wealth and the trappings of society held no interest for him. He did, however, possess an inordinate amount of charisma and an ability to connect with people in order to get things done. As Mr. Hatzis observed: "He had a magic about him."
A memorial for Nick Mirkopoulos will be held Sunday, Jan. 26, from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. at Cinespace's Studio B, 30 Booth Ave., Toronto. RSVP by calling 416-406-4000.

Full text:   Fraud, nepotism, conflict of interest, questionable expense claims. In almost any workplace, these alleged transgressions would have led to one of two bleak prospects: resign or get fired. But in city council chambers across the country, some of those cloaked in scandal keep marching onward.
Last month, Ontario Ombudsman André Marin released a scathing report highlighting the lack of accountability in the local governments of cities and towns across the province.
"To me, some municipalities are like gangrenous limbs," Mr. Marin said in an interview. He's dealt with all manner of scandals in Ontario, but says municipal mayors and councillors "make provincial politicians look like choirboys."
The issues range widely, from cronyism all the way to gangsterism, but the problems plaguing mayors across Canada raise consistent questions: Are municipal structures too broken to hold elected officials to account? Has oversight not grown at the same rate as some municipalities?
There is no doubting the seriousness of many of the alleged offences. In Laval, Que., former mayor Gilles Vaillancourt faces many criminal charges including gangsterism, while corruption-plagued Montreal has had four mayors in just over a year.
In Ontario, London Mayor Joe Fontana will be on trial this year on charges of fraud.
Toronto Mayor Rob Ford has openly admitted to using crack cocaine while in one of his "drunken stupors," though he has not been charged with any crime. Some of the issues are financial or political. Brampton Mayor Susan Fennell's expenses are being audited following unproven allegations of budget misuse, while Winnipeg Mayor Sam Katz has weathered accusations of cronyism.
Although polls show Canadians have greater trust in municipal politicians than in provincial or federal ones, lack of accountability seems to be most rampant at the local level, says Brian Kelcey, a Toronto-based political analyst who previously worked as Mr. Katz's special adviser in Winnipeg and is now managing Toronto mayoral hopeful David Soknacki's campaign. The problem, say both watchdogs and analysts, goes beyond individual officials. Some cities, such as Laval and Brampton, have expanded so quickly that mechanisms of oversight have not kept pace.
"You end up with big-city cost and big-city government without the big-city controls that would normally be put in place because there hasn't been the time or political energy to push for those to be in place," Mr. Kelcey said.
Quebec's Mascouche, Terrebonne and especially Laval became cities by turning farmland and forest into bustling bedroom communities in a matter of a few decades. The growth brought millions in real estate deals and public works projects into towns with little of the governance expertise and oversight required to keep things honest.
"Even in bigger cities, a corrupt administration will go to war with auditors," said Danielle Pilette, an urban affairs professor at the Université du Quebec à Montreal. "We saw it in Montreal, where the auditor had his tip line taken away. Laval had an auditor who lasted a week."
Brampton's mayor has provoked outrage in recent months after it was revealed she had spent $186,154.60 of public funds since December, 2010, claiming flight upgrades and private language lessons. The spending was only unearthed when the weekly Brampton Guardian filed a freedom of information request to see the claims, as they are not published anywhere. New reports last week revealed she and her staff spent $185,000 on airfare and hotels in the last five years.
Until 2011, the city's finance department reviewed the mayor and city councillors' discretionary spending, but last February council passed a new expense policy that removed that process. In November, Ms. Fennell quickly shifted attention to her fellow councillors' spending, which included buying home security systems and symphony tickets on the taxpayers' dime. "Perhaps they're hoping that if the public looks at my expenses, which I stand by... maybe they're hoping nobody looks at theirs," she said in an interview.
Through a staffer, Ontario Municipal Affairs Minister Linda Jeffrey declined to be interviewed.
In Winnipeg, the issue of oversight has reared its head over the actions of Phil Sheegl, the city's former chief administrative officer. In his two years as CAO, Mr. Sheegl became embroiled in multiple scandals on projects he oversaw, including the new police headquarters that came with major cost overruns and a fire-paramedic station construction program in which an auditor found contracts were unfairly awarded.
Mr. Sheegl is a close friend of the city's mayor, Mr. Katz, and his qualifications - a career spent mostly in real estate - prompted observers to accuse the mayor of cronyism. Mr. Sheegl resigned last fall. The mayor, who sits on the committee that appointed Mr. Sheegl, has said their personal relationship had nothing to do with the hiring. Mr. Katz's office did not respond to interview requests.
Toronto's Mr. Ford has made international headlines with his crack admission, but has remained on the job. Toronto council - lacking the ability to remove him from office - has made do with passing multiple motions that have stripped the mayor of many of his powers.
The recent spate of cases of misbehaving mayors has prompted calls for laws allowing impeachment or voter recall. Mississauga's Mayor Hazel McCallion - who was cleared of conflict-of-interest charges in June - is not a believer. "Is it democratic?" she asked in an interview. "If the public is unhappy with a politician, you could have citizens' groups always asking - you'd be busy dealing with recalls."
Political scientists have speculated that another reason city halls are rife with scandal is the lack of a party system. In Toronto, despite the alienation of many members of his executive, Mr. Ford has not had to face the internal wrath of a party.
Many look to Vancouver, one of the few cities with a party system, as a model. Ahead of 2008's municipal election, incumbent mayor Sam Sullivan, whose popularity was slipping, lost the support of his party, the Non-Partisan Association, to another candidate. Without the backing of the NPA, he decided against running in the election.
"I believe in the party system," he said. "I believe that it really does provide real value and if I couldn't win the party nomination, I accepted the decision of the party."
Still, Mr. Kelcey warns, party systems aren't perfect. They can breed strong controls over messaging and marginalize minority party councillors. "Everything that's gone wrong in Montreal and the Montreal area," he noted, "have gone wrong with a party system in place."

Full text:   The Garibaldi at Squamish project would be built in phases over 20 years at an estimated cost of $2.9-billion
The public comment period for the proposed Garibaldi at Squamish project, an all-seasons resort that would be built about 15 kilometres north of Squamish, has been extended from Jan. 7 until Jan. 14.
The deadline was extended to fix an administrative error over the original date, an Environmental Assessment Office representative said Tuesday in an e-mail.
The proposal, which dates back to the 1990s, includes plans for a mountain resort that would feature two 18-hole golf courses, 23 ski lifts, 124 ski trails and nearly 6,000 housing units, including more than 1,700 hotel units.
According to a revised project description filed last year with the province, the project would be built in phases over 20 years at an estimated capital cost of $2.9-billion.
The initial stages - including ski lifts, infrastructure and the two golf courses - have an estimated price tag of $838-million. The Vancouver-based backers of the project are Northland Properties - the parent company of Sandman Hotels and Denny's restaurants - and the Aquilini Investment Group, which owns the Vancouver Canucks and also has extensive holdings in real estate and agriculture. Northland Properties also owns and operates the Revelstoke Mountain Resort.
The proposed Garibaldi at Squamish resort would border Garibaldi Provincial Park and be situated between Vancouver and Whistler.
An environmental assessment process has been under way for years, with recent studies focusing on water supply after the province in 2010 ordered the proponent to provide more information about the proposed water supply for the resort. Since then, the proponent has filed additional water studies and a revised project description.
To date, public comments - posted online in late December - have cited concerns ranging from the potential effect of climate change on glaciers and snow cover to whether the market can support another big ski resort so close to Whistler Blackcomb.
"I question the viability of the business plan for this project," said one submission, for which personal information was withheld. "There are three other ski resorts in close proximity to this location, including Whistler which offers world-class conditions to which this location cannot compare."
The same submission also flagged climate change as a potential concern.
"I would also like to see a study on the potential impacts of climate change on snow and weather conditions for the [Garibaldi at Squamish] location. Shrinkage in local glaciers has been documented and with the location's proximity to the coast, I feel the community has reasons to doubt that the [Garibaldi at Squamish] resort can provide consistently ideal snow conditions that would make it a sought-after ski resort."
The assessment process for the project continues.

Canadian market's quirks give dog-spa operator pause

Abstract: We wouldn't want to give advice to another company because we wouldn't want to think we are experts at this. What we do believe in is listening to customers, finding out what it is they want and how we can best serve them. We're taking the lead from Canadians. For example, all the customers we've heard from have made it clear they don't want "Nordstrom lite" - they want what the large stores in the U.S. have and we're working to give them just that.

Full text:   Each week, we seek out expert advice to help a small or medium-sized business overcome a key issue.
When Amy Nichols visited Vancouver three years ago, inspiration struck her. The founder and chief executive officer of Dogtopia, a dog daycare and spa business based in Virginia, noticed how devoted and affectionate Vancouverites are toward their pets.
"I said to myself, 'Those are our people,'" says Ms. Nichols, who is planning a rapid expansion of her company into Canada. "Our customers are very committed to their pets and highly educated."
Vancouver was an easy market to add to the company's list. But Ms. Nichols and her team have had more difficulty picking locations for several of the planned 35 Dogtopia franchises in Canada.
Over all, she senses a big opportunity. Dogs can be found in one-third of Canadian households, according to Statistics Canada, and Canadians spent $6.5-billion in 2012 on their beloved animals, according to the Pet Industry Joint Advisory Council of Canada.
Last year, sales from Dogtopia's 29 U.S. locations amounted to more than $14-million (U.S.). Clients drop off their dogs for care that includes exercise, gourmet dog treats, shampoos and even pedicures. When owners leave for vacation, Dogtopia provides overnight stays in accommodations far more comfortable than a kennel.
Though dog lovers share similar qualities wherever they live, Ms. Nichols knows that Canadian regional and cultural differences must be respected.
"It's always very different when you go into another region, and Canada is even more unique because it is another country," she says, adding that Dogtopia is aiming to find a local owner for each franchise. "We see the value of having a local developer, knowing there are subtleties in different states and provinces, and on the different coasts."
Ms. Nichols has partnered with Peter H. Thomas, a British Columbian and founder of Century 21 Real Estate Canada, to devise a strategy. Dogtopia also has hired the research company Environics to produce a demographic study to help plot out the locations.
Still, the company's goal is to spend less than 18 per cent of the projected revenue in each location on a commercial lease; that figure has proven to be key to the financial success of Dogtopia's U.S. operations.
Finding Canadian sites that match that criteria and also meet the demographic profile has been difficult. In the U.S., most of the Dogtopia locations are in the suburbs. With Canada's population based around its major cities and its distinct cultural differences, the company is carefully scrutinizing the locations during its expansion plans.
The experts
How can Dogtopia expand into Canada while preserving its profitable franchise strategy and brand?
Joey Caturay President of the advertising agency Little Room , Toronto
Canadian consumers are in general more contemplative and conservative than their American counterparts. My advice to Dogtopia is that they err on the side of caution for their customer acquisition projections. They can accelerate their acquisition rate through a dog-lover community outreach program before they launch their service.
They can tap into a wealth of local dog demographic information through social channels and local blogs related to dog walkers and breeders. Commercial websites, such as petpriority.ca, offer "DRM" systems: dog relationship management programs that may be used to survey dog owners.
For triangulating franchise locations, look for maps of dog off-leash facilities offered by major Canadian cities. This, combined with the demographic information, should produce a short list of viable locations.
Iveta Koskina Financial planner, Investors Group , Toronto
Pets are difficult to entrust into anyone else's hands. And Canadians like supporting Canadians. With that in mind, here are a few suggestions that will help Dogtopia win over Canadian hearts.
Through marketing or while creating rapport with consumers, support Canadian culture. Know the cultural symbols and how to incorporate them in a campaign that will find emotional engagement. Understand the topics that create regional pride. Once the trust and emotional bond has been made with the brand, the location issue becomes less difficult. As long as clients know there is an element of fun, safety, exercise, good food and top-quality care, they won't hesitate to make a drive to entrust their loved ones to Dogtopia.
Brooke White Vice-president of corporate communications for Nordstrom Inc ., Seattle, Wash.
(The U.S. department store Nordstrom is expanding to Canada with five locations, the first of which is planned to open in Calgary in fall 2014.)
We wouldn't want to give advice to another company because we wouldn't want to think we are experts at this. What we do believe in is listening to customers, finding out what it is they want and how we can best serve them. We're taking the lead from Canadians. For example, all the customers we've heard from have made it clear they don't want "Nordstrom lite" - they want what the large stores in the U.S. have and we're working to give them just that.

Abstract: Not only have China's wealthy been avoiding the country's equity market, they've been desperately trying to move their wealth entirely out of the country.

Full text:   sbarlow@globeandmail.com
China was the world's fastest growing large economy in 2013, and one of its worst performing stock markets.
While December data aren't in yet, the country's gross domestic product is believed to have expanded by 7.5 per cent last year, a rate that leaves North American and European economies in the dust. Yet the Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index - the nation's largest equity benchmark - fell 6.5 per cent.
The disconnect between the Chinese economy and equities is bizarre. The past decade has seen GDP almost triple (in nominal terms) while equity markets are up only 41 per cent.
Stock markets look forward, discounting future profits. It seems that investors in Chinese equities must not like what they see looming ahead.
But what exactly do investors fear? At first glance, it makes no sense that Chinese equities trade at eight times forward earnings expectations when GDP is expected to leap ahead by 7.2 per cent in 2014. The S & P 500, in contrast, trades at 17 times forward earnings when U.S. GDP is expected to grow at a measly 2.6 per cent.
To be sure, financial regulations restrict foreign ownership of Chinese stocks and this has limited market performance. But, that can't be the whole answer. China now has twice as many millionaires - 1.25 million - as France and Germany combined, according to the Hurun report on Chinese wealth accumulation. So there's no shortage of domestic funds that could drive the market higher if investors had any type of faith in the profit outlook.
Not only have China's wealthy been avoiding the country's equity market, they've been desperately trying to move their wealth entirely out of the country. Citing a study by property consultant Saville, The Atlantic's Quartz magazine reported that wealthy Chinese were the buyers for 27 per cent of London real estate sold in 2012, and the dominance of Chinese investment in British real estate actually increased during the first half of 2013.
The flood of Chinese money headed to foreign locales is in keeping with a warning last year from the International Monetary Fund, which said that further loosening of China's capital controls would risk a large and destabilizing exodus of wealth from the country.
Why would the best informed segment of China's population - the high-ranking government officials and successful businesspeople that hold the majority of the country's wealth - look to move money overseas when local economic growth is widely expected to continue at three times the rate of the United States?
I suspect the reason that China's moneyed elite isn't pouring their wealth into China's stocks is because they hear the loud ticking of the country's debt bomb.
Credit market stress was the dominant investment story in China in 2013. Because 42 per cent of the Shanghai Composite is made up of financial service firms, it was also the primary reason for the dismal performance of stocks. The end of each quarter saw sharp spikes in interbank lending and other interest rates as Chinese banks scrambled for funding.
The wobbles in the Chinese credit market reflect several worrisome factors. One is the popularity of wealth-management products - short-term notes backed by dubious underlying assets - that have grown to account for 20 per cent of all bank deposits. In addition, there is the tendency for banks to simply roll over or extend maturing loans for struggling corporations rather than list them as non-performing debt. This is obscuring the health of bank balance sheets.
The severely depressed levels of valuation among Chinese stocks imply local investors have no faith in the profit outlook for Chinese companies. Credit market volatility indicates why - and also suggests a reason why investors aren't more excited by the prospect of strong economic growth. They may fear that more credit-driven GDP growth in 2014 will just add to the problem of bad debt and unprofitable businesses.
The Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index is a case where equity markets are cheap for good reasons. Over the long term, it is likely that China will succeed in rebalancing its economy and return to high levels of sustainable growth. In the short term, however, Canadian investors should avoid China-related investments.

Abstract: Ordinarily, I don't like mysteries that have animals or kids as sleuths. Adventure yarns, though, when they're as good as this one, can have both. [Theresa Schwegel], who won an Edgar award for her debut novel Officer Down, takes us to the mean streets of Chicago with a boy and a dog on a desperate and dangerous mission. The Murphy family is falling apart. Officer Pete of the Chicago PD has been demoted for his involvement in a nasty public scandal.

Full text:   The Good Boy by Theresa Schwegel
Minotaur, 368 pages, $29.99
Ordinarily, I don't like mysteries that have animals or kids as sleuths. Adventure yarns, though, when they're as good as this one, can have both. Schwegel, who won an Edgar award for her debut novel Officer Down, takes us to the mean streets of Chicago with a boy and a dog on a desperate and dangerous mission. The Murphy family is falling apart. Officer Pete of the Chicago PD has been demoted for his involvement in a nasty public scandal. His wife is angry about the involvement of another woman and the family have lost their home and are in a down-at-heel rental. All of which leads his teenaged progeny McKenna to some low-life friends and a hot party. Joel, her 11-year-old brother, is worried and follows her, along with his father's K9 dog Butch. After a confrontation, boy and dog go on the run in search of a trusted judge who Joel believes can help. How the two survive on the streets and the increasing desperation of his father's search forms the heart of the novel. It's both suspenseful and believable. The psychological interchange between Joel and Butch is terrific and Schwegel doesn't turn the dog into a person. He's a fully formed character and provides some of the best action but he remains - hurrah - a dog. This is one for mystery fans and pet lovers alike.
The Sayers Swindle by Victoria Abbott
Berkley, 304 pages, $8.99
There's nothing nicer on a cold winter's eve than a cute and cuddly mystery. Settle into your woollies by a fire and read this second Book Collector series by Ottawa mother-daughter writing team Victoria Abbott (that is, Mary Jane and Victoria Maffini), featuring book sleuth Jordan Kelly. Last time out, Jordan was on the trail of a rare Agatha Christie tome. Now she's searching for some first editions of Dorothy L. Sayers books, missing and presumed stolen from her employer's vast and valuable library. The Maffini women are smart and funny and they put it all on the page. They also know their Golden Age British mysteries and how to drop the clues, along with the dead bodies, into the story. This is great fun for all fans of puzzle plots.
Phantoms of Breslau by Marek Krajewski. Translated by Danusia Stok
Melville International Crime, 288 pages, $25.95
Who knew Polish noir could be this good? Thanks to an excellent translation, we get the full flavour of Breslau (now Wroclaw) in 1919. The Great War has just ended and Breslau is still German. Detective Inspector Mock is summoned to a crime scene of pure horror. Four sailors have been murdered and savagely mutilated, their bodies dumped on an island in the River Oder. Mock goes into the bowels of the city in his search for the killer and, as he uncovers clues, he unwittingly provides the murderer with more victims. Krajewski never lets go of the narrative and his vision of mean streets is as dark as it gets. This is the fourth book in the series so far and it's better than the other three.
The Inheritor's Powder by Sandra Hempel
WW Norton, 352 pages, $27.50
Sandra Hempel combines a brilliant history of arsenic, one of the world's oldest poisons, with a real-life detective tale that has a great twist at the end. In short, it has it all. The subtitle is "A Tale of Arsenic, Murder and the New Forensic Science." We're in the 19th century, which began with a plague of murders by arsenic, a readily available substance that could kill someone without leaving proof of murder. Hempel takes us easily through the historical background and on to the Bodle Case. In November, 1833, wealthy John Bodle and three of his servants were taken seriously ill. Bodle died and his considerable estate was headed for his relatives when a local doctor called it murder. Arsenic - "The Inheritor's Powder" - was the cause of death. The book then turns to a whodunit using the "new" forensics tools of the day. I couldn't put this one down.

Full text:   Northwest region of province, particularly in Kitimat, is booming as more energy companies open local offices
The prospect of liquefied natural gas plants being built in northwestern British Columbia has sent assessed values for residential properties soaring in the region.
In the District of Kitimat, the average assessed value for single-family detached homes was $228,000 on July 1 last year, up 26.7 per cent from the previous evaluation on July 1, 2012, according to new data released Thursday by BC Assessment.
The provincial Crown corporation provided valuations on a wide range of residential and commercial properties. Bragging rights for British Columbia's most expensive residential property belong to Lululemon Athletica Inc. founder Chip Wilson, whose Vancouver waterfront mansion along scenic Point Grey Road has been valued at $54.2-million. In the previous annual assessment, as Mr. Wilson's property was being developed, the value was pegged at $35.2-million.
Across British Columbia, the total value of assessment rolls climbed a modest 1.35 per cent. But in Kitimat, the real estate market is booming.
Rose Klukas, Kitimat's economic development officer, said local housing prices continued to rise in the second half of 2013 - a sharp improvement from 2010, when many workers left the community after West Fraser Timber Co. Ltd. closed its Eurocan pulp and paper mill.
"What we're seeing is people coming in and investing in Kitimat because they see the writing on the wall for future development," Ms. Klukas said in an interview.
Kitimat's economy rebounded in 2012 as Rio Tinto Alcan embarked on a modernization program for its aluminum smelter. And while no final investment decisions have been made yet on LNG projects, energy companies have opened local offices and are doing some preliminary work.
Kitimat LNG, a 50-50 joint venture between the Canadian units of Chevron Corp. and Apache Corp., is seeking Asian buyers for LNG. Also in the Kitimat area, the LNG Canada project headed by Shell Canada Ltd. has Asian partners that have agreed to buy LNG - PetroChina, South Korea's Kogas and Japan's Mitsubishi Corp.
Rental vacancy rates in Kitimat hit 40 per cent several years ago, but have tumbled to near-zero for availability. Some Kitimat landlords who formerly charged monthly rent of roughly $600 for an apartment have renovated their units and are now able to collect more than $1,500 a month, said Ms. Klukas, who has been economic development officer since August, 2011.
"When I started in this job, it was pretty dire straits here. In a short period of time, the investment climate has changed quite dramatically," she said.
In nearby Prince Rupert, excitement over proposed LNG projects is also increasing. Malaysian energy giant Petronas is leading the Pacific NorthWest LNG project, while BG Group's Prince Rupert LNG Exports Ltd. is another major player.
Assessed values for single-family homes in Prince Rupert averaged $196,000 last July 1, up 8.9 per cent from the previous annual valuation, said Christopher Whyte, deputy assessor in the North region.
Average assessed values for single-family housing rose 8.8 per cent to $348,000 in Fort St. John in northeast British Columbia, where energy companies are focusing their drilling efforts for natural gas in the Montney play.
Housing prices in the Vancouver region were relatively flat. A typical property on Vancouver's East Side had an assessed value of $1,135,000 last July 1, up 4.9 per cent from the previous evaluation. On Vancouver's West Side, the latest assessment was $1,249,200, down 0.5 per cent from July 1, 2012. Most homeowners in the Vancouver area will see assessed values in the range of falling 5 per cent to rising 5 per cent, said Dharmesh Sisodraker, deputy assessor for the Vancouver Sea to Sky region.

China debt shrouds economy in haze of risk

Abstract: Outsiders are less convinced, not least Fitch, the ratings agency, which as early as April this year downgraded China's local currency sovereign rating. Fitch cited the explosion in credit, which has been rising at a rate faster than economic growth since the crash. Half of the local government debt comes due by the end of the next year and analysts are concerned the large number of uneconomic civic projects mean that debt is being rolled over, not repaid.

Full text:   We know about the Federal Reserve taper and we are no longer afraid. We know about those indebted Mediterranean euro zone states and we still worry just a little. What keeps us awake in the small hours, to misquote a famous American general, are those risks that we don't know we don't know. So, right on cue to disturb our holiday slumber comes the Chinese National Audit Office with the news that Chinese local government debt has risen to 17.9 trillion yuan ($3.15-trillion), a 67 per cent increase since the last audit in 2010.
Rampant spending on bridges, town halls, social housing and even entire new cities has accumulated $3-trillion (U.S.) in borrowings since the 2008 financial crash. It's a headache for the new president, Xi Jinping, as he takes on the task of reforming China's financial system. The more immediate concern is whether any part of this accumulation of civic debt, much of it off balance sheet in special purpose vehicles, is exposed and at risk of default, due to a growth slowdown and rocky local government finances. The central government in Beijing reckons the audit is good news because it shows that total government indebtedness at all levels is little more than half of China's GDP, a level far below the indebtedness of the U.S. and many Western countries.
Outsiders are less convinced, not least Fitch, the ratings agency, which as early as April this year downgraded China's local currency sovereign rating. Fitch cited the explosion in credit, which has been rising at a rate faster than economic growth since the crash. Half of the local government debt comes due by the end of the next year and analysts are concerned the large number of uneconomic civic projects mean that debt is being rolled over, not repaid. Notwithstanding the sanguinity at official levels, Fitch reckons total credit in China was twice the size of the Chinese economy at the end of last year, thanks to the extraordinary expansion of China's "shadow banking" sector, consisting of non-bank private lending institutions. These have provided much of the funding for the real estate boom. It is in the provinces that the problems lie, where entire towns have been constructed, in anticipation of huge industrial developments that have not arrived. Fingers frequently point at Ordos, a notorious "ghost town" in Inner Mongolia, which was built to house a million in expectation of mining developments, but which remains largely empty. Yet vacant housing complexes lie on the edges of many provincial cities, a consequence of official policy to enlarge the urban environment.
Debt is also rising in the corporate sector, where state-owned enterprises still control a vast portion of the economy. If China's growth rate in the coming year fails to generate sufficient jobs and revenues to finance the huge provincial debt load, President Xi may be faced with municipalities demanding rescues. The choice is between a bailout from Beijing, which will only encourage more reckless borrowing in the shadow market, or implementation of harsh market medicine.
No one knows what a municipal default might look like, but it is reasonable to suppose anything substantial would have implications for China's unofficial banking market: A rush to the exit, soaring loan costs and local bankruptcies. The unravelling consequences could be unpleasant, unless you believe that the command apparatus of central government will smooth over any bumps in the road with edicts to banks and undisclosed distributions. That was the policy after the Lehman Brothers crash - but a homegrown credit crisis might look very different.

The portfolio
Investment properties
The investor
Justin Chung owns a dozen income properties outright, and several more as joint owner. He is not bothered by gloomy headlines on the Canadian real estate market. While Toronto and other cities may be getting frothy, places elsewhere in Canada are still affordable.
How he invests
"I purchase positive cash-flow properties in desirable neighbourhoods," says Mr. Chung. "They also need to be in cities that have a strong opportunity for appreciation due to favourable economic fundamentals, such as growth in the local economy, jobs and population."
His most recent purchase, in the fall of 2013, was a semi-detached home in Edmonton. It's located in a "family-friendly neighbourhood" close to schools and transportation arteries. Built within the last eight years, the dwelling was "in rent-ready condition with no repairs required."
Another purchase was a duplex in Hamilton, during the summer of 2012. It was "in a great location and had some upscale touches, like exposed brick walls, high ceilings and hardwood floors." After some renovations, "the two units rented out very quickly for above-market rents."
Best move
About seven years ago, Mr. Chung bought his first income property, a student rental within walking distance of the University of Waterloo. The cash flow has been good, and so have the "solid equity gains." He has borrowed against the equity to make down payments on subsequent acquisitions.
Worst move
"When I bought that first student rental property in Waterloo, I thought I could do everything [including the repairs] ... but it cost me in terms of time. I quickly realized that it is better to get the right professionals who know what they are doing and instead focus on the areas that I am stronger at."
Advice
"Build your team - this includes your realtor, mortgage broker, lawyer, property manager and insurer. Invest time in establishing long-term relationships."
Network with like-minded investors, Mr. Chung adds. One way he did this was by joining the Real Estate Investment Network.

Full text:   A new musical written by a real estate executive brings people together to celebrate a revitalized Regent Park
The audience sat rapt. It's rare to have a story of real estate development told with an R & B accompaniment and the swagger of jazz poetry.
The sold-out performances over two nights in late November were billed as a neighbourhood celebration, attracting a theatre and media crowd to hear a musical about Regent Park, a 69-acre neighbourhood of downtown Toronto that had become synonymous with inner-city troubles.
Left to decay for decades as a failed government experiment in lower-incoming housing, the neighbourhood has now seen a wholesale revitalization. "Buildings coming down/everything I've known," one song goes.
There were no tunes, though, about Daniels Corp., the development company behind the massive rebuilding project whose president, Mitchell Cohen, wrote the original script and music for the musical called The Journey: A Living History of the Regent Park Revitalization .
"The building of buildings is, to a great extent, the easy part of this work. The hard part is how do we lay the social infrastructure where people are going to feel good living together in this neighbourhood, sharing the same amenities," said Mr. Cohen, sitting before the show inside the Paintbox Bistro, a new restaurant also part of the redevelopment.
The performances, staged in the neighbourhood's new Daniels Spectrum arts centre on Dundas Street East, in its 400-seat theatre, is an example of property developers helping to boost the arts to cultivate a sense of community.
The neighbourhood's old bricks-and-mortar housing complexes have been torn down and replaced with glass-and-steel high-rise apartment buildings. The 15-year redevelopment, which formally began in 2006, is still in the throes of construction. About 7,500 housing units will eventually be built, with a mix of about 70-per-cent condos and 30-per-cent rentals. The exact numbers are still changing as the development continues.
The aim is to create a new mixed-income area with businesses gradually moving in, with amenities such as a major grocery store and bank, a new aquatic centre, athletic grounds and a six-acre park.
The rebuilding required 2,083 homes to be vacated; some families moved into new housing immediately, although some had to be relocated temporarily and then moved back into the new housing units. For many, the move was traumatic, with families worried about their displacement. The theme of the evening performances was this social and psychological shift.
The $30-million Daniels Spectrum centre, standing alone among the high-rise apartment blocks, includes five performance spaces that easily adapt to corporate events, with the bistro and a large catering-ready kitchen next door.
Daniels contributed $4-million toward the construction and operation of the centre. In fact, the development company's involvement in the arts and culture of the rebuilt community has been central to the development plans since contracts with the city were finalized in 2006.
"How are we going to bring people together?" Mr. Cohen said, citing this as the paramount theme behind the rebuilding.
Arts and culture considerations didn't exist in the zoning bylaw for the redevelopment. Yet a social development plan had been drafted as part of the partnership Daniels has with Toronto Community Housing for the massive project. It took into account the community's great diversity, with 57 languages spoken within its boundaries and a wealth of artists and grassroots organizations already there.
Mr. Cohen, soft-spoken but a quintessential people person, noted how he met Sakina Khanam by chance on the street. She and a group of Bengali women made traditional quilts, but found it hard to make a living from that in Canada. Mr. Cohen took them under his wing. One of their quilts depicting a Toronto street scene now hangs prominently in the lobby of one of the central, modern highrises. The woman are also developing tote bags for new residents moving into the community. Meanwhile, the hallways of the new buildings are also filled with other artwork bought from local artists.
"Embedding arts and culture in the DNA of our communities, how do we do that? That's the challenge we set for ourselves. And Regent Park was an opportunity to really take that thesis and work it very hard," Mr. Cohen said.
But with few places for arts groups to meet in the neighbourhood, Daniels and Toronto Community Housing had to shift the development plans. They had to free up space for the 60,000-square-foot, three-storey art centre, by adding apartments to the plans for surrounding buildings.
The centre is owned by Daniels, Toronto Community Housing and the not-for-profit Artscape, which develops and manages spaces for the arts. "Legally, there were the three partners, but the Regent Park community was a very principal player in the development, as well," said Celia Smith, Artscape's executive vice-president in Toronto.
Artscape has a 50-year lease to manage the building. Capital funding came from provincial and federal governments ($12-million from each), as well as a $10-million campaign by Artscape. To keep running, the centre has a $1.5-million operating budget, with rents from groups that use the space, such as the Regent Park School of Music and the Centre for Social Innovation, and from theatre companies and corporations using the performance space.
But "there's always room to grow, particularly on the programming side," Ms. Smith said. Part of the $10-million raised helps to subsidize rents. As funding continues, new mentorship and internship programs for local youths are being introduced.
And the art and theatre world is taking notice. The evening performances of The Journey included star Sterling Jarvis, known for his roles in The Lion King and We Will Rock You , and veteran jazz and blues diva Jackie Richardson, who both worked for much less than the normal performance fees. They were joined by young singers and dancers.
The aim is to maintain Regent Park's identity, and not, as some suggested, to call the redevelopment Cabbagetown South, which would try to link it artificially to the gentrified neighbourhood to its north. But Mr. Cohen stressed that simply building new housing isn't enough to revitalize the area.
"There are still enormous challenges ahead in using the physical infrastructure that is being built. The arts and culture centre is one of the most important pieces."

Full text:   Rise in average prices buoyed by strong rebounds in pricier markets such as Toronto and Vancouver
REAL ESTATE REPORTER
Canada's housing market is on track to close out 2013 on a stronger note than last year, defying the expectations of economists just a few months ago.
The picture is mixed across the country, and sales are certainly not on a runaway train. But their strength contrasts starkly with the plethora of lacklustre forecasts that were made earlier this year, after sales fell as a result of Finance Minister Jim Flaherty's decision to tighten mortgage insurance rules in July, 2012.
The degree to which prices are surpassing expectations is even higher. That's a development that could be worrying to policy makers in Ottawa, amid international debate about how overvalued Canadian house prices are and whether a bubble has formed.
The Canadian Real Estate Association said on Monday that it now expects the average price of houses sold over the Multiple Listing Service to have risen by 5.2 per cent this year, to $382,200. Heading into 2013, CREA had been expecting the average price to rise just 0.3 per cent; it became even more pessimistic in March when it revised its forecast and called for a 0.2-per-cent decline, to $362,600.
CREA's prediction for the number of houses that will change hands this year is now 458,200, which would be a 0.8-per-cent increase from 2012. In contrast, at the outset of 2013, CREA was expecting sales to fall 2 per cent, and by March it was expecting sales to fall by 2.9 per cent.
CREA noted that rising mortgage rates appear to have bolstered sales this fall by prompting buyers to move more quickly than they otherwise would have. The increase in average prices is being skewed to a degree by the strong rebounds in pricier markets such as Toronto and Vancouver.
But CREA, which represents real estate agents in Canada and tracks sales via the MLS system, is calling for sales to grow by 3.7 per cent in 2014, while it expects average prices to rise by 2.3 per cent.
"While we would not describe the housing market as the 'comeback kid' just yet, the market is certainly showing us its reluctance to fade to the background," said Toronto-Dominion Bank economist Sonya Gulati.
She expects that higher mortgage rates will eat into affordability and prevent the market from taking off over the next few years. That would put a damper on economic growth but would be good news for worrisome household debt levels and house prices. Deutsche Bank economists in New York released a report last week saying they believe that Canadian house prices are 60 per cent too high, and that "Canada is in trouble."
The ratio of household credit-market debt to disposable income climbed to 163.7 per cent in the third quarter, Statistics Canada reported last week. "Household leverage continues to rise despite mortgage rates increasing roughly 40 to 60 basis points since the spring," National Bank analysts said in a research note on Monday.
At the same time, rising house prices led to a 1.8-per-cent increase, or $20-billion, in the value of real estate assets last quarter, Royal Bank economists noted.
Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz said last Thursday that he expects imbalances in household borrowing and residential investment to stabilize and then gradually unwind in coming years, leading to a soft landing in the housing market. But he also noted that "there is a risk that household imbalances could keep building and set the stage for a sharp correction down the road."
Resales rose 5.9 per cent in November on a year-over-year basis, with the monthly showing coming in slightly above the 10-year average, CREA said. The average sales price was 9.8 per cent higher, which Ms. Gulati noted is "far above the pace of household income growth."
The MLS Home Price Index, which seeks to account for changes in the types or locations of houses that are selling to create a more apples-to-apples comparison, rose by 4.1 per cent.
That was the fastest rate of price growth in 16 months, according to Bank of Montreal economist Robert Kavcic. Last week, Teranet and National Bank released their house price index, which showed that prices rose 3.4 per cent in November from a year earlier, compared with a 3.1-per-cent gain in October. On a month-to-month basis, the index declined 0.1 per cent from October to November.

CREA LOSES MONTREAL
The real estate agents belonging to the Greater Montreal Real Estate Board have voted in favour of breaking away from the Canadian Real Estate Association.
The move, which comes just after the Chambre immobilière de Quebec made the same decision, means their listings will no longer be on the Multiple Listing Service or Realtor.ca.
As of Jan. 1, 2014, "CREA will remove all properties from Greater Montreal Real Estate Board members from realtor.ca, but they will remain on Centris.ca," a spokeswoman for the Montreal board said by e-mail. Centris.ca is a rival home listings website created by the Quebec Federation of Real Estate Boards in 2010, and includes only listings from agents within the province.
The Canadian Real Estate Association, a national industry group that owns the MLS, has more than 100,000 agents, brokers and salespeople in its membership who work through about 100 separate real estate boards and associations.
Diane Menard, vice-president of the Montreal board, said in a press release that its decision is confirmation of "a rejection of the status quo." The local board has had disagreements with CREA over a number of issues, including its code of ethics (Montreal argues that Quebec already has the most highly regulated agents and that CREA's code adds confusion) and its new data distribution facility that allows agents to advertise their listings on each other's websites.
Pierre Leduc, a spokesman for CREA, called the Montreal decision unfortunate. "Members who wish to remain in CREA have a number of options, including joining some of the remaining Quebec boards. In addition we understand some members are working to create a new real estate board in Montreal with full CREA membership," he said in an e-mail.
Ms. Menard said that the federation will continue to provide CREA with data about the Montreal market.

Full text:   Chilean communities struggle after halts at Pascua Lama and other mines
Real estate broker Patricia Cortes began a small corporate events business in the northern Chilean town of Vallenar four years ago, with her eye on a gold mine.
Her hopes for success were pinned on the vast Pascua Lama gold-copper project that had begun taking shape 150 kilometres away in a glacier-covered area of the Andes on the border with Argentina.
Vallenar is the closest commercial centre to Pascua Lama, and the town was set to reap rich benefits from the $8.5-billion (U.S.) project.
Once it gets going, Pascua Lama, with 18 million ounces of proved and probable gold reserves, is expected to produce up to 850,000 ounces in its first five years.
But prospects for the Cortes's business look much bleaker now that Barrick Gold Corp. has shelved construction of the mine, citing lower metal prices and a series of regulatory and legal roadblocks imposed by the Chilean government.
"Commerce is stalled in Vallenar," Ms. Cortes said in a phone interview. "Like us, many hotels and inns in the region have stopped taking clients. There's very little activity."
In May, 2013, after a four-month investigation, Chile's environmental watchdog ordered Barrick to halt work due to violations of environmental regulations; it imposed a $16-million fine. Two months later, an appeals court ruled that Barrick had to first build a promised water management system of canals, pipelines and drainages, to divert run-off water away from the mine, before resuming construction.
Barrick chief executive Jamie Sokalsky said in October that construction would resume at Pascua Lama when "improvements to its current challenges have been attained."
The tensions that have roiled Pascua Lama have also played out at Goldcorp Inc.'s neighbouring El Morro gold-copper project. A local appeals court has ordered a temporary halt to construction at El Morro while it weighs a claim by 15 Diaguita indigenous groups that accuse Goldcorp of not conducting adequate consultation with local communities.
Pascua Lama and El Morro are the latest examples of the difficulty and the cost involved in persuading local communities to accept mining projects in what was once one of the world's most mining friendly countries.
Views differ on how badly the local community will be hit by the suspension of Pascua Lama.
Local mining services suppliers will be the biggest casualties, said Juan Carlos Sáez, president of Chilean mining council Corminco in the region of Coquimbo. Atacama and Coquimbo make up the mineral-rich area of Norte Chico, where Pascua Lama is located.
On the other hand, local authorities in Atacama insist that Barrick's decision will have a limited impact on the region's economy and employment levels, given that construction has been halted since the July court order.
"There's certain speculation that Atacama's economy will freeze. We discard this fully. It continues to be one of the healthiest and safest regional economies in Chile," said regional secretary of economy, José Ignacio Esquivel.
But according to Corminco's Mr. Sáez, the impact will be substantial. "Pascua Lama was already part of the regional project portfolio for the next 20 years. It was expected to create 5,000 jobs and each phase of its development involved contractor work. We believe that nearly 2,000 jobs will be lost just because of the suspension of these contracts," he said.
At least 30 mining contractor companies in Coquimbo region have been affected directly by the halt, said Mr. Sáez. "They hired people and bought equipment. Now they have to readjust their plans and restructure debt. The loss is not on Barrick, it's on Coquimbo," said Mr. Sáez.
Despite the mounting list of environmental and legal challenges to the project, Barrick's decision "took all of Vallenar by surprise," Ms. Cortes, the event planner, said.
"We thought things had settled after the rulings. The authorities had been very clear, stating it could resume once the water system was built," she said.
Barrick's community relations team has been "proactively communicating the status of Pascua Lama and the reasons behind the decision to temporarily suspend it," said Barrick's spokesman in Chile, Luis Alberto Pino.
It has mounted a door-to-door campaign at the local level in both Chile and on the Argentine side of the border, and targeted communications to key stakeholders. "We will continue to work with and support local communities during the suspension period, and we will continue to meet all of our social and legal obligations," said Mr. Pino.

Full text:   As city money shifts away from natural rinks, volunteers have organized to build and maintain them in parks around the city
The thermometer reads a tolerable minus six degrees, but a stiff west wind is blowing as Kevin Talmage drags a thick, 80-foot-long hose across the snow-dusted turf of Bennington Heights Park at the south end of Leaside.
It's 10 p.m. on Tuesday night and the park is empty, but Mr. Talmage knows that will change when skating season starts. He hooks the two-inch-wide nozzle to a temporary city water service that's sticking up out of a hummock of wood chips.
Water spills out across the thin layer of ice that formed earlier this past Tuesday during the season's first flood.
"You've got to love doing it, because it's bloody cold out here," says Mr. Talmage, as his unfazed Labrador retriever chews on a frozen tennis ball at his feet.
Mr. Talmage works from home, marketing medical equipment, and is one of 10 neighbours who volunteer uncounted hours a week through the winter to see that a 30-by-18-metre patch of this park becomes a frozen ice rink.
Mr. Talmage's son and two daughters (two hockey players and a figure skater by another measure) are the main inspiration for his efforts, but as he arcs the spray toward centre ice he also draws a direct link to his grandfather.
"My grandfather made us a rink on our pond every year when we were growing up. His tractor became a Zamboni. Yes, it broke through a few times, but by three o'clock every afternoon the rink was mint, and all our friends would come over," he says. "He told me, 'I'll do this for you, but one day you do it for someone else.'"
City Hall press releases often boast of Toronto's unmatched number of 53 outdoor artificial ice rinks. But it's compressor-free, volunteer-driven efforts such as this that put Torontonians on ice at up to another 40 natural ice rinks across the city.
To share tips and encourage more would-be hosers to start their own rinks, Toronto Park People hosted an information night Thursday at Sorauren Park with volunteers from Parkdale. The group's mandate is to promote citizen involvement in parks.
Co-ordinator Anna Hill points out that, in winter, that means skating rinks. "When word of mouth spreads, these rinks proliferate and people realize that they are a great way to bring people together in public spaces during the winter."
Bennington resident Shelly Raftis helped get their rink started with a garden hose and a sprinkler in 2008. She puts in at least a shift a week a the end of a hose but is also the go-between with the city staff for a permit process that she describes as simple, a word not often used by those organizing volunteer activities in parks.
When winter comes to Bennington, city staff show up to set up the water supply, provide the hose and climb the light towers to turn around the lights that normally illuminate the park's tennis courts.
Helpful though city staff may be, they are playing a diminished role.
Natural rinks are managed by different area supervisors, but parks department manager James Dann maintains a bird's-eye view. He says that before amalgamation, city staff maintained many natural rinks that had been left over from a different ice age. In 1958, for example, Toronto had 81 natural rinks and only six artificial pads. As the city puts its dollars toward the more weatherproof refrigerated pads, the numbers of natural rinks melted away. Mr. Dann says that, since amalgamation, all natural rinks have been community-run.
The best display of the local approach might be at Fairmount Park, where the Icemasters, a volunteer force of 60, maintain two rinks.
The city passed on responsibility for the park near Gerrard Street East and Coxwell Avenue about 15 years ago. The Icemasters picked up the nozzle and will be out in force this Saturday, spending the day putting plywood boards up. Then the nightly rotations of six-person flooding crews will take over until lasting thaws come in early March.
Each winter, Ray Bernard is a real estate agent by day, Icemaster by night. He says that the group has become a multitalented, four- season "community resource."
"We're called on all year long to do things like help out with barbecues and park fundraisers," Mr. Bernard said.
Still, their specialty is watching water freeze.
While Mr. Bernard notes they count among their members Andrew Platt, Environment Canada's Arctic research co-ordinator, he downplays the complexity of their task.
"It's not all that scientific," he says. "Mostly we learned on the job. If it's cold, it's easy. If it warms up, then opinions on what to do vary. We usually call an 'executive meeting' and go to the local pub to discuss."
For better or worse, the five-day forecast is ruling out urgent executive meetings. In fact, Mr. Bernard says it's the earliest start to the season in the last eight years.
"The guys are excited to get going," Mr. Bernard said. "We have as much fun as the kids."

Full text:   Hudson's Bay and Macy's have posted double-digit share price gains as 'broadline' retailers display new vitality
Christmas sales are in full swing, but there are few deep discounts to be had among the biggest names in department store stocks.
Hudson's Bay Co. is up nearly 20 per cent since its September earnings report and is now the most expensive department store stock in North America. In the United States, shares of Macy's Inc. have climbed nearly 10 per cent after a mid-November earnings report revealed resilient sales despite a supposedly cautious consumer.
The surge in these stocks flies in the face of what used to be the conventional view of the new world of retailing. Pundits said we had entered a polarized world, with mass discounters like Wal-Mart on one end and higher-end retailers like Nordstrom on the other. There was little room in the middle for department stores, or so theory had it.
But Hudson's Bay and Macy's - the biggest department-store retailers in Canada and the United States, respectively - are demonstrating that there is a market for retailers who can cater to the middle-class shopper while mixing in the right blend of upscale elements. Both are setting the stage for a period of solid performance that will help justify their robust share prices.
"I think the middle is big," says analyst Paul Swinand, who covers Macy's for Morningstar.
To be sure, there are dangers in betting on a return of mid-tier merchants. Some "broadline" retailers, as department stores are called, have followed the script and turned into basket cases. But in the worst cases - think Sears Holdings and J.C. Penney - the major culprit was operational error.
In contrast, Hudson's Bay appears to be doing some significant things right. The company, which completed its acquisition of luxury retailer Saks Inc. last month, seems poised to capitalize on the No. 1 Canadian retail trend of 2013: goosing its share price by spinning off properties into a real-estate investment trust.
It is also making progress in improving sales per square foot at the Bay. Same-store sales - a key retail metric that tracks sales at locations open for at least one year - rose 6.2 per cent in the quarter that ended in August. (To be fair, discounting seems to have played some role as well, as gross profit margins fell more than a full percentage point from the prior year's quarter.)
The news for the quarter was otherwise mixed. Same-store sales at Lord & Taylor, the company's U.S. chain, fell 1.2 per cent, and Hudson's Bay missed its overall earnings expectation. The quarter, says Credit Suisse analysts David Hartley and Daniel Battiston, with understatement, "was not necessarily demonstrative of future success in executing the profit growth plan."
In the near term, however, investors are focused on a spinoff of the bulk of the company's real estate in a REIT, which could be unveiled as soon as Wednesday's earnings announcement.
CIBC analyst Perry Caicco, in a July note analyzing the Saks acquisition, estimated the U.S. retailer's real estate was worth $1.5-billion (U.S.) of the $2.9-billion purchase price. (The flagship Fifth Avenue location in New York City could be worth $800-million by itself, he figures.)
Placing those properties into a REIT along with the Canadian real estate would add several dollars per share to Hudson's Bay's share price, analysts figure - or, at least, they did three months ago, when the shares were trading at $16 to $17 (Canadian) apiece. With the stock topping $21 in recent trading sessions, it's bumping up against their target prices, suggesting the boost from a REIT announcement will be much smaller than the ones seen earlier this year. The seven analysts with "buy" ratings on the stock have an average target price just under $22, according to Bloomberg data, with the most bullish at $24.
The sole dissenter, Kathleen Wong of Veritas Corp., noted that even at $17 a share, Hudson's Bay was trading at a valuation above its U.S. peers, although its profit margins were lower and its debt levels were twice as high. The valuation premium is even greater at current levels.
She calculated the company's fair value at $14, or $19 in the event of a REIT spinoff, saying "the competitive landscape is intensifying, with Target on track to open 124 stores by the end of 2013 and Nordstrom's plans to open five stores in Canada beginning in fall 2014 ... merchandise at the Bay stores will be squeezed by Target at the lower end and Nordstrom at the higher end."
Of course, that was what was supposed to happen to Macy's, too. But the company, with more than 800 stores and $28-billion (U.S.) in sales (including its Bloomingdale's nameplate) has been a "steady Eddie" as the U.S. has emerged from recession, Mr. Swinand says. "They've steadily increased same-store sales and maintained margins, and they've done it all with internal programs that I call blocking and tackling."
Macy's calls the initiatives MOM. The first M is for My Macy's, a reference to how the retailer tweaks the merchandise mix in every single store to suit local preferences. O is for "omnichannel": making it easier for customers to shop in stores, online or through mobile devices. The final M is for another acronym, MAGIC selling, which includes getting salespeople to be nicer to customers.
This seems like obvious stuff, but it also seems to be working. Third-quarter earnings easily beat expectations and were 31 per cent above prior-year levels. Same-store sales increased 3.5 per cent.
Macy's "has significant buying power, strong relationships with its vendors, unique merchandise offerings, and strong national brand recognition, which we believe will help to achieve market share gains," says analyst Richard Jaffe at Stifel, Nicolaus & Co. Inc. He has a "buy" rating and target price of $55, slightly above Friday's close of $51.83 (U.S.).
Morgan Stanley's Kimberly Greenberger has an "overweight" rating on the stock and a $54 target price, saying she believes "the market underappreciates Macy's continued market share gain potential, as well as the retailer's best-in-class free cash flow yield and share buyback capacity."
Her "bull case" for the stock, which involves market-share gains accelerating, expanding profit margins and a higher price-to-earnings ratio, is $70.
Indeed, Macy's "steady Eddie" status suggests there may not be much downside to the shares, and more solid surprises may drive the price higher. Hudson's Bay seems a bit more of a gamble. The news at the Bay appears good, but the share price is being driven by retail-REIT mania. Once a spinoff occurs, Hudson's Bay stock will rise only so long as management continues coaxing more dollars from Canadian shoppers.

Full text:   David Mirvish's proposed complex by Frank Gehry would be a showpiece. But as city council looks at the plan this month, what are they really talking about?
abozikovic@globeandmail.com
David Mirvish owns the nicest Tim Hortons in Toronto - or at least the space it's in. To find it, visit the corner of King and John downtown; walk up the century-old stone steps, turn left and enter a long loft space. Here the Tims tables and donut cases rest under a ceiling of Douglas fir the creamy colour of maple frosting.
But both the Tims and the loft could give way to Mr. Mirvish's dreams: So long, Tim, and hello, Frank. Mr. Mirvish has proposed a grand redevelopment of this site, designed by the architect Frank Gehry, that would replace four loft buildings and the Princess of Wales Theatre with high-end retail space, a private gallery for Mr. Mirvish's collection of paintings, facilities for OCAD University and 1.5 million square feet of condominiums in three very tall towers.
When Toronto City Council looks at it this month, they will be deciding whether to approve the proposal - which, in its current state, would break the city's guidelines for the positioning of tall buildings, rules for heritage preservation, expectations of a public space, and requirements for private amenity space. Not to mention its size, which would smash the zoning precedents for the area.
On the other hand, the complex could make an exciting impact on the city. Mr. Mirvish, who has made important contributions to to the city, is explicitly trying to change our skyline for the better. This would add three towers by the brilliant Mr. Gehry plus the cultural components and, in Mr. Mirvish's view, a new centre for "luxury retail" and high-quality residents. In broad strokes, he is right. If the project is refined, it would set a new bar for the architecture of tall buildings in Toronto. But it's not a building yet. What is it, really?
1. It's a bit of a bluff
Mr. Mirvish, who did not reply to interview requests this week, is asking for the moon: He wants permission to build in a manner that would dwarf other developments in the area and would generate hundreds of millions of dollars in profit. Last month, Mr. Mirvish told me that he is seriously committed to adding his mark on the skyline. "I think the world outside of Toronto could see us in a new light. That's what Gehry does for us."
So far, after a year of discussions with the city, he has been adamant about preserving the integrity of the design from "a made-in-Toronto solution" that is small, and, he implies, parochial. He claimed to be "bemused" that the city is opposing his project.
"This project raises a bunch of serious issues that are intertwined," said Jennifer Keesmaat, Toronto's chief planner, in an interview this week. "It's not only one thing. There are so many challenges, so many misses." She points to the size and orientation of the buildings, the loss of heritage, too little private amenity space and the lack of a contribution to community facilities. "We simply do not have enough public space in this area," she says. "And a new project that's deficient just creates a bigger burden for the neighbourhood."
Is Mr. Mirvish really surprised at this reception? Or is he engaging in a bit of showmanship? Bluffing is part of the game for developers in Toronto. Because the city's development approval process is so murky, the final outcome for any given site is determined by a negotiation. Developers routinely ask for the moon and then compromise. It is very likely that this is what's happening here, with a new version of the project being hashed out in advance of the council meeting.
The proposal is best understood as a bold opening bid, which leaves a lot of room for a negotiation toward a more modest and generous building.
2. It's hugely dense
The proposal includes 2,709 condo units in three towers as high as 86 storeys, not to mention its retail and cultural components. By contrast, the tallest existing building in the neighbourhood - TIFF Bell Lightbox and the Festival Tower condos above it - is barely half as tall, at 47 storeys, with 373 residential units.
If it were built as proposed, selling that volume of real estate would be a challenge. And if it happened, it would impose hugely on the infrastructure of the area, adding 3,000-odd residents to an area whose public spaces and transit lines are badly overcrowded. The area, which the city dubs the Entertainment District East Precinct, has seen a radical transformation in the past decade that has added thousands of new residents, and it will see 15,000 more condo units completed in the next few years.
Local councillor Adam Vaughan has been pushing district-wide studies of the area to get a handle on the needs including parks and community space, and on the scale and arrangement of the many new buildings. If the city approves Mirvish Gehry at this scale, it opens the door for similarly massive proposals from other developers.
3. It's a historic problem
Mr. Mirvish's proposal would demolish four heritage buildings, warehouses dating to 1901 to 1915, effectively without a trace. These properties were assembled by Ed Mirvish, who created a theatre district here after he bought the Royal Alexandra Theatre back in 1963. (Remember Ed's Warehouse?) These buildings are not of exceptional architectural quality, but they are useful and of historical significance, even according to Mr. Mirvish's own consultants. Right now, they house tenants from small architecture firms to offices for Apple.
Yet while the city always demands some form of "retention" for designated buildings, Mirvish suggests the Gehry proposal is valuable enough to override any heritage concerns and wipe the buildings out. For buildings designated historic by the city, this is nearly unprecedented. "This scheme is taking the city back 40 years," to the era of blockbusting, says the heritage advocate and architect Catherine Nasmith. "It's so retrograde."
To win the city's approval, some portion of the historic buildings will need to be saved. As Ms. Nasmith correctly points out, Toronto has a sophisticated culture of working with heritage buildings: Back in the 1960s, the partnership of Jack Diamond and Barton Myers showed the world how contemporary development could work as "infill," in and around older buildings. They rehabilitated one of the warehouses that's now owned by Mr. Mirvish, and had their offices there. Today, that building houses KPMB, one of Canada's best architecture firms, which has designed two recent projects - the National Ballet School, and Koerner Hall at the Royal Conservatory of Music - that show how new and old can coexist and are among Toronto's best buildings, period.
For another counterexample, see what Allied Properties REIT and Co. Architects are doing with the QRC Centre a few blocks away: retaining the brick-and-beam loft building and, with some spectacular engineering, suspending a handsome 10-storey slab of contemporary office space in the air above it. That's possible, and also profitable.
4. It's a Gehry
Let's not overlook a central fact: This would be the biggest work ever built by, arguably, the greatest living architect. A Toronto-born Californian, Mr. Gehry is a singular figure in contemporary design. Since his artistic star rose in the 1980s, he has built a series of complex, provocative, and technologically sophisticated buildings that changed the world. The idea of "starchitecture," which he personally despises, owes more to him and his Guggenheim Museum Bilbao than anything else.
In Toronto, the shafts of the three towers he is designing would (wisely) be different in form and material, but while the details remain vague, I have no doubt each would be beautiful. Why? Despite his caricature on The Simpsons "designing" by crumpling a piece of paper, Mr. Gehry runs an extremely tight ship as an architect. And his biggest building, a Manhattan apartment tower dubbed "New York by Gehry," is a gorgeous and original work, a classic skyscraper wrapped in a shimmering, rumpled cloak of stainless steel.
But the bottom half of this King Street proposal, which will have an enormous impact on the area, is still half-baked at the moment. The irregular front face of the building, which has varied dramatically in the two versions of the design released so far, is still unresolved in form. Its strategy of a vertical lobby with escalators that step up through three levels could work, but in its current shape it could feel narrow and mean. Within, Mr. Mirvish's private gallery - home to his prized art collection, and another of the things that's motivating him to do this project - would have its front door on the third floor of a shopping mall. Will people come in? If not, the other entrance is on Pearl Street, a narrow street that will be soaked in shadows, and would carry vehicles serving 1,900 apartments and a shopping mall.
Now, Mr. Gehry and his staff don't miss details like this. For proof, visit their one project in Toronto, the renovated Art Gallery of Ontario. Despite the long and somewhat tortured process of its commission, it is a beautiful building executed with precision and grace down to the last doorknob. The King Street proposal does not measure up to it. But it might. Mr. Gehry always, famously, works through dozens of versions of a design before he views a project is complete. At the unveiling of the King Street project last fall, he was quite frank about this. "You have to understand, it's precarious to show a building like this, because it seems like it's finished," he told me. "It's not. These are works in progress."
I hope they have continued to progress, and that we'll see them built in a form that's more generous to the city.
The Tims, I expect, is on the way out.

Borders complicate gifts to heirs

Abstract: "In estate planning you need to ask 'Who are the beneficiaries and where are they,' particularly when you're dealing with clients who are newer residents of Canada," Mr. [Bruce Cumming] says. "If your beneficiaries are in different jurisdictions or, given the high mobility of our society, moving to different jurisdictions, you can't go to sleep with your will - you have to make changes as the location of your beneficiaries' residence changes."

Full text:   Canadians leaving money or property to residents of other countries could find their value being eaten up by taxes
When Bruce Cumming heard that a client's son had relocated to Australia because of a job promotion, one of his first thoughts was: Time to revisit his client's estate plan.
Mr. Cumming, senior investment adviser and executive director of the private client group at Cumming & Cumming Wealth Management Inc. in Toronto, was thinking about the implications when Canadian residents pass on assets to relatives living abroad. For example, could the beneficiaries be hit by significant taxes in their home country? Will they be able to manage a gift of real estate in Canada?
In a country of immigrants and globally mobile citizens, these implications are something Canadians need to consider when making plans to leave money or other assets to beneficiaries living abroad.
"In estate planning you need to ask 'Who are the beneficiaries and where are they,' particularly when you're dealing with clients who are newer residents of Canada," Mr. Cumming says. "If your beneficiaries are in different jurisdictions or, given the high mobility of our society, moving to different jurisdictions, you can't go to sleep with your will - you have to make changes as the location of your beneficiaries' residence changes."
Many Canadians today - especially those who arrived here as immigrants - are already sharing their wealth with relatives abroad; according to the World Bank, in 2012 Canadians sent an estimated $23.4-billion in money remittances overseas. It should come as no surprise, Mr. Cumming says, that these Canadians would also want to leave an inheritance for family members living abroad.
Young Canadians are increasingly leaving the family nest and pursuing career opportunities in other countries, says Prashant Patel, vice-president for high-net-worth planning services at RBC Wealth Management.
"What we're finding more common now is grown children going to the U.S. or to the U.K. and becoming residents there, and when their parents pass their assets, they are going to their children in these countries," he says.
To ensure an inheritance doesn't turn into an encumbrance, Canadians planning to leave assets to beneficiaries in another country should take into account Canadian and foreign tax and estate laws, says Cheyenne Reese, a taxation, trust and estate planning lawyer with Legacy Advisors Law Corp., in Vancouver.
"If, for example, a trust is created for someone overseas, the trust itself might be considered a Canadian taxpayer but the beneficiary might also be subject to tax in their own country," Ms. Reese says. "Depending on where the beneficiary is located, there can be very complex and potentially punitive rules.
"A big challenge is that you're having to deal not only with Canadian rules but also the rules of the beneficiary's home country."
Complex tax rules on monetary gifts aren't the only challenge for Canadians with out-of-country bequests. If you're thinking of leaving the family cottage to your daughter in New York, or perhaps a downtown condominium to a niece in India who could use the steady rental income, you may be passing on problems along with the property, Mr. Cumming says.
"If your beneficiaries are going to end up owning a cottage in Muskoka or some other property in Canada, then now they have to take title of the property and appoint a representative in Canada who can sign off on the real estate," he says. "Then they have to manage the real estate, and on top of all that there are tax considerations because now they own foreign property and in various jurisdictions like the United States, you're required to report all income worldwide."
What often happens in these cases, Mr. Cumming says, is the beneficiaries end up selling the real estate rather than dealing with the headaches of owning Canadian property.
The Canada Revenue Agency requires non-residents to prepay a percentage of estimated capital gain when they sell their real estate property in Canada, and the sale must be reported within 10 days to avoid a financial penalty. Given these requirements, Ms. Reese says, it may be better for Canadian owners to sell their property and pass on the cash, rather than the real estate, to their beneficiaries overseas.
David Altro, a Toronto-based Florida tax lawyer and managing partner at Altro Levy LLP, which specializes in cross-border tax and estate planning, says Canadians with real estate property in the U.S. should consider transferring ownership to a cross-border trust if they want to pass it on to family members living south of the border.
This keeps the property from being subject to probate in the beneficiary's home state, Mr. Altro says.
"Let's say you're a Canadian who owns Florida property and you want to leave it to your son. When you pass away that property will be subject to Florida probate, which is very expensive and time-consuming," he says. "Whereas a cross-border trust doesn't die, so there's no probate, and the trust remains in place after you die."
Canadians who intend to leave substantial cash assets to children or other family in the U.S. might want to consider setting up a "trust for life" to protect their beneficiaries' estate from getting hit big time by the Internal Revenue Service, says Mr. Altro. Under U.S. law, beneficiaries of an inheritance from Canada don't get taxed upon receipt of their windfall, but when they die their estate gets taxed at 40 per cent after the first $5.25-million.
With a trust for life, any assets inherited under the trust don't become part of the beneficiary's estate, Mr. Altro says.
Mr. Patel at RBC Wealth Management says an international trust might be a good solution for Canadians with beneficiaries in other countries. These trusts are typically set up in countries where there is little or no income tax.
Income from these trusts may continue to be taxable in Canada, Mr. Patel says, but depending on where they live, beneficiaries could avoid paying high taxes in their own country when they receive their inheritance.
*****
WHERE THERE'S A WILL
Canadians who own real estate in, say, India, or have money sitting in a bank account in Austria, and want to bequeath these assets should have a will made where the assets reside. This makes it easier to persuade local authorities and banks to release these assets to beneficiaries, says Bruce Cumming, a Toronto investment adviser. "A bank manager in Austria might feel ill at ease releasing funds from an account on the orders of a Canadian will," Mr. Cumming says.
But there's a caveat: Most wills start with a statement revoking any prior will. So a will intended to take care of assets and relatives in another country could actually render void a Canadian will that covers all other assets and beneficiaries, says David Altro, a Toronto-based tax lawyer. "If you've got assets and beneficiaries in various countries, make sure you're dealing with lawyers that are licensed in each of those countries," he says. "And make sure they all understand your intentions."

Rockport Group is offering up a low-rise condo project in Hillcrest Village designed by Raw Design and targeted at buyers eager to live in the mid-town neighbourhood nearby the popular Wychwood Barns.
The infill project, called Nest, will provide shelter for over 120 one- and two-storey suites in a nine-storey structure at St. Clair and Hendrick avenues, just west of Bathurst Street.
"We've produced a range of units to suit a range of needs; we have lots of units for young professionals, small families and couples getting together," says Jack Winberg, chief executive officer for the Rockport Group. "We think for people who want to stay in the area - or are attracted to the area - will find a condo that suits them at the Nest."
The established low-rise neighbourhood is popular for its treed streets, parks and recreational facilities, as well as easy access to independent shops, cafes, supermarkets and streetcars along St. Clair Avenue.
"Hillcrest Village is a very special place. It's a great community and is very diverse in terms of cultures, ethnicities and tons of restaurants," says Mr. Winberg.
"A lot of people walk to where they're going to. Like Wychwood Barns around the corner has been a very successful addition to community."
Retail space will ground the mid-rise, which will be much shorter than many condominiums projects nearby. "It fits into the community. It's not a large project with hundreds and hundreds of units," Mr. Winberg says.
"We like projects where we can create a community where people can feel at home."
To strengthen residents' connection to their surroundings, the building's modern exterior - designed by Raw Design like an organic assembly of boxes - will result in private outdoor spaces up to nearly 570 square feet.
"We have 48 different unit types amongst 123 suites, so we have a lot of interesting units, some with big terraces and some looking north, some looking south with views over the city," Mr. Winberg adds.
Floor-to-ceiling windows will maximize sightlines and sunlight inside, where there will be open principal rooms and bedrooms with sliding glass or barn doors in some cases.
"We think our designs are very neat and efficient, and will really accommodate what we believe to be the lifestyle that people looking for condominium living today would really enjoy," Mr. Winberg adds.
"Most of our two-bedroom units ... and many of our one-bedroom and dens have two washrooms, so it adds a lot of flexibility to the way the condo is used."
Should residents need more room to stretch, there will be a gym, pet spa and fireside party room with a library, kitchen and terrace, plus indoor and outdoor lounge areas on the roof with cooking and dining facilities.
Local design firm, II by IV Design , will fashion the the common areas and suites, which will feature nine-foot ceilings, engineered hardwood floors, custom bathroom vanities with quartz counters, European-inspired kitchen cabinetry and glass backsplashes.
One and two-storey penthouses will benefit from an extra foot of headroom and rooftop terraces in some plans.
Another project highlight will be eco-friendly components, from Energy Star appliances and low-flow faucets to a green roof, bicycle parking and geothermal energy system.
"One of the biggest increases in cost of living over the next 50 years will be the cost of energy, so we're thinking about long-term benefits and cost savings to our purchasers," Mr. Winberg adds.
Monthly fees will be 53 cents per square feet. Parking will be $35,000 and a locker $3,500.
Occupancy is slated for spring 2016.

Full text:   In most countries, the path from Ernst & Young to helping street protesters attempt to oust a sitting government is not a well-travelled one.
But in Ukraine, a country with a dismal business environment that is being rocked by huge anti-government demonstrations, the route makes perfect sense.
And it is one Roman Tatarsky knows quite well.
Since returning to the country after the Orange Revolution of 2004, the Canadian-born businessman of Ukrainian descent says he has witnessed corruption, bureaucratic mismanagement and an impossible-to-comply-with tax regime become worse under the current government.
With his wife, the former director of E & Y's risk management consultancy has brought bread, sliced meat, cheese and baked goods - as well as two garbage bags full of jackets, sweaters, scarves and gloves - to protesters who have barricaded streets and occupied the Kiev city hall.
The country's government - which protesters accuse of corruption, cronyism and economic mismanagement - has been in turmoil since President Viktor Yanukovyh scuttled a trade agreement with the European Union and chose to align Ukraine more closely with Russia.
The protesters have at times numbered 350,000 and are being backed in their fight by an unusual ally: Businesses are arranging flexible work schedules that permit attendance at massive rallies and sending out memos that make it clear workers won't be punished for attending protests.
"By and large, businesses are being very supportive," Mr. Tatarsky said, adding people seem more united than during the Orange Revolution. "Here, there is no disagreement that people want to live by European values of transparency, rule of law and fairness - not the Russian model of dictatorship. This revolution is also much more aggressive, in thought and in actions; perhaps because the organizers are more experienced, perhaps because the people are single-minded and desperate."
For business people in Ukraine, things have only gotten worse. In Transparency International's recent global survey on perceptions of corruption, Ukraine was the worst performer in Europe, ranking 144 in a tie with Nigeria, Iran and the disintegrating Central African Republic.
Mr. Tatarsky, who now manages several real estate properties, including a small boutique hotel, said the interest rate on loans is between 15 and 30 per cent, making expansion next to impossible.
Mr. Tatarsky said many employees in the Ukrainian-speaking western part of the country are showing up at offices - where speaking of politics is traditionally taboo - with a change of warmer clothes to take part in street protests after business hours. But in Russian-speaking eastern Ukraine, which generally supports the government, Mr. Tatarsky said businesses have shown little support for protests.
Mychailo Wynnyckyj, a business professor at the Kyiv-Mohyla Academy who also teaches sociology, said he recently consulted with a 500-person company that sent out a memo making it clear employees would not be punished for participating in protests.
"The promise of euro integration is not really about Europe, but about a system of rules where you don't have a mob that's basically trying to milk your business for everything it's worth," said Mr. Wynnyckyj, who was born in Kitchener, Ont. The economic impact so far, he said, has been muted, particularly since Ukraine's shadow economy will likely continue to function. But he said he expects some currency instability of protests continue.
On Tuesday, as bond yields soared and the central bank pleaded for Ukrainians not to withdraw their bank deposits, the country's parliament rejected a motion for a confidence vote. The President flew to Beijing seeking loans and investment.
Ruslana Wrzesnewskyj, 59, a Toronto real estate agent who runs a hotel in Ukraine's Carpathian mountains, has gone to court to battle officials who wanted to take her property away. She was in Kiev recently on a charitable pursuit, trying to get 36,000 pairs of shoes to local orphanages.
"We've had so much difficulty getting them through customs because there's so much corruption - it's corrupt from top to bottom," she said. "The people have had enough. ... I suspect they'll be on the streets for a very long time. I think Europe and North America should wake up."

Auction for Bob Dylan's
Newport Folk Festival
Guitar going once, going twice, going electric. The Fender Stratocaster that Bob Dylan audaciously plugged in at the 1965 Newport Folk Festival had a tobacco-sunburst finish and a lot of explaining to do. The instrument, which put the shocked traditional folk crowd in a jeering mood, was lost soon after the gig. It was recently determined that the family of a pilot who was flying Dylan around back then had the guitar all this time, and now (after an agreement was reached with Dylan), the offending Strat goes under the gavel at Christie's in New York, where it is valued at $400,000, but is expected to fetch much more.

VISUAL ART
Marcel Dzama
Marcel Dzama, 39, now calls Brooklyn home, with a career shepherded by New York super-gallerist David Zwirner, the second-most-powerful individual in the international art scene, according to Art Review magazine. But the Winnipeg-born multidisciplinary artist has not forgotten his roots. For fund-raising purposes, Dzama recently donated 57 characteristically spacey drawings to Winnipeg's not-for-profit Plug In Institute of Contemporary Art Gallery. Created between 1994 and 2000, the drawings date to Dzama's heyday as a mainstay of the 'Peg's influential Royal Art Lodge. (The exhibition/sale is at Toronto's Feheley Fine Arts through Dec. 21.) James Adams
TELEVISION
Saturday Night Live Christmas
As festive TV traditions go, this annual retrospective beats the heck out of watching Frosty the Snowman . The two-hour special recalls the most memorable moments culled from SNL's 38-year history. Must-see sketches include Steve Martin's snarky "Holiday Wish," the lost ending of It's A Wonderful Life , the more recent music-video classic "D**k in a Box," performed by Andy Samberg and Justin Timberlake and Adam Sandler's touching "Hanukkah Song." (NBC, Global, 9 p.m., Dec. 4) Andrew Ryan
THEATRE
Jack & the Beanstalk:
An East Van Panto
After years of dramatic twists and turns, Vancouver's York Theatre - which came this close to demolition - finally opens next week. On Commercial Drive in the heart of East Van, the restored 100-year-old theatre reopens with Jack & the Beanstalk: An East Van Panto . The work was created specifically for this occasion by a group of local creative luminaries: produced by Theatre Replacement, written by Charles Demers, directed by Amiel Gladstone, musical direction by Veda Hille. A pantomime, often performed around the holidays, takes a familiar fairy tale and injects music and contemporary references (this being Vancouver, there is a scheming real estate agent) in a way that is meant to appeal to both children and adults, and encourages audience participation. (First performance, Dec. 4; opening night gala, Dec. 6; runs until Dec. 29.) Marsha Lederman
FILM
Let the Fire Burn
Jason Osder's documentary relies exclusively on found footage to revisit the May 13, 1985, Philadelphia police raid against the black liberation group MOVE, and the fateful decision to drop a bomb from a police helicopter onto the group's fortified headquarters. The resulting fire killed six adults and five children, and destroyed 60 homes. Osder's film traces the troubled history between the Philadelphia police and the group and, in its second half, focuses on the sequence of events of the day. (Dec. 6) Liam Lacey

The coach looked over his downcast, mud-spattered squad in the dressing room. He began pointing at them. "You're handsome. You're handsome ...," he said. "Now look at those other guys. He's ugly.

Full text:   The reserve is no longer an afterthought in Vancouver. Under their beloved chief, the band became a First Nations powerhouse
In the days when Ernie Campbell was growing up, and years before that, the Musqueam Indian Reserve was one of the best-kept secrets in Vancouver. Tucked behind bush and forest in the city's otherwise posh southwest enclave, the reserve was still without electricity, indoor running water and paved streets into the 1950s. With their children shunted off to residential school, it was a struggle for the Musqueam to retain any of their rich culture in the shadow of the large metropolis looming over them.
"We were so secluded, like we were just dropped here," says Mr. Campbell's sister, Darlene Point. "I would tell non-natives where we were, and they would be shocked to find out a reserve was there."
Today, no one needs to be told of the community's existence. The Musqueam are no longer an afterthought. They have become a First Nations powerhouse, cutting deals with governments, municipalities and developers worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Rarely does anything significant take place on their traditional territory, including the 2010 Winter Olympics, without their nod and involvement.
While a number of far-sighted leaders presided over this dramatic sea change, no Musqueam stood taller and longer than Chief Ernie Campbell.
Mr. Campbell was chief of the Musqueam for 20 years, the last 14 in a string of seven, pivotal two-year terms that ended only with his retirement in 2012. His unexpected death at 72 from diabetes complications on Oct. 26 stunned and saddened the reserve, whose 1,200 members could be forgiven for thinking their long-time chief invincible.
Over more than four decades, whether running for chief or councillor, he never lost an election, a feat almost unheard of in the rough and tumble world of local native politics. Nor did he lose many other battles, whether in the boxing rings of his youth, on the waters where he skippered his beloved, 11-man Musqueam war canoe to victory after victory, or at the negotiating table. Backing down was not part of his nature.
"He knew exactly what he wanted," says Eric Denhoff, a former B.C. deputy minister of aboriginal affairs. "His approach was: This is what we want to do, this is why and here is what we need from you. He was a very tough negotiator, always looking three or four steps ahead."
During Mr. Campbell's later years as chief, the Musqueam pursued and concluded a dizzying series of lucrative real estate deals. They acquired title to the popular University of British Columbia golf course, plus another 22 hectares nearby; swapped claims to a chunk of land in nearby Richmond for an office tower in Burnaby; signed off on ambitious reserve housing projects with the likes of Vancouver Canucks co-owner and millionaire developer Francesco Aquilini; and parlayed their official Olympic partnership into tens of millions of dollars, plus a new community centre.
Musqueam councillor Wade Grant says Mr. Campbell was spurred by a desire to benefit future generations for years to come. "He would tell us: 'This is all so my children's children won't have to bang the table any more.'"
Yet despite these eye-popping transactions, perhaps no achievement gave Mr. Campbell more satisfaction than a modest breakthrough late in his final term, when he stood firm with protesters blocking a proposed condominium project over a Musqueam midden close to the Fraser River. While still chief, Mr. Campbell brokered the purchase of the site, assisted by $4.8-million in provincial funds.
It was the measure of the man. Throughout his life, Mr. Campbell was resolute in his determination to see the Musqueam reassert their place in society and press their title to traditional territory that had been gobbled up by urban expansion.
That meant battling in the courts, too. According to lawyer Marvin Storrow, the Musqueam were responsible for three of the most important 15 aboriginal legal cases decided by the Supreme Court of Canada. "We have been here for 9,000 years, and we're not going anywhere," Mr. Campbell liked to say.
But there was more to the tough, often gruff, chief than his hard-nosed drive to expand Musqueam resources. As a younger man, Mr. Campbell almost single-handedly drove the resurrection of athletics on the down-at-the-heels reserve. He formed soccer teams, including the first Musqueam girls unit, and coached them. He brought back the tradition of war canoe racing, his fierce discipline spurring the Musqueam from a sad-sack crew to one that took on all comers.
And most notably of all, Mr. Campbell was also the guy who drove the school bus. A side of him little known to outsiders, he did this for 40 years, through two generations of Musqueam, to the day before he went into hospital. Grand Chief Edward John of the First Nations Summit says he lost count of the times Mr. Campbell would leave a leaders' meeting or important native gathering, explaining: "I have to get the kids home."
At Mr. Campbell's memorial service, a dozen sombre schoolchildren marched to the front, each carrying a sunflower to place on their bus driver's casket. Outside the cavernous gymnasium was their heartfelt sign reading: "We love and miss our old chief and wish he were here."
'Never let a textbook dictate who we are'
Ernest Clark Campbell was born Aug. 13, 1941, to Mary Jane Campbell, a stalwart Musqueam, and a hard-working Irish-Canadian, Webster McKusick. The two never married, and their relationship did not last. But they were together long enough to produce seven kids. All grew up on the reserve. All kept their mother's name.
Despite his mixed parentage, Mr. Campbell never considered himself anything but Musqueam. His pride in his roots was a force in everything he did. "There was an ancestral knowledge that pulsed through his veins," says Wendy Grant-John, a former Musqueam chief. "It was something I don't think he had any control over. It was just there, and he was driven by it."
Mr. Campbell's daughter Jocelyn saw that firsthand when she once asked her father if natives were the loincloth-wearing savages depicted in her school textbook. He ordered her to tell the class their book was wrong. "And don't you be ashamed," he instructed. "Never let a textbook dictate who we are."
But being Musqueam also meant the torment of residential school. As a child, young Ernie was dispatched to St. Paul's in North Vancouver. Like many, he kept his experience to himself. Jocelyn says her father never mentioned his years at the school, until the federal government's official apology in 2008. "He came out okay, but while he was there, he witnessed a lot. I don't think he wanted to deal with it."
Still, it was also at St. Paul's that Mr. Campbell came under the tutelage of Alex Strain, who founded the famed Buckskin Boy boxing competitions for natives. (The first competition in the early 1950s made news across North America, when a group of nuns tossed in $50 to allow the cash-short fisticuffs to take place. Instead of bandages for his fighters' hands, Mr. Strain scrounged a bunch of strips used to lower coffins into graves. "We'll knock 'em dead," he told a reporter.)
Mr. Campbell and his brother Eddie excelled in the ring, winning trophies galore at both the more well-known Golden Gloves and the Buckskin Boy tournaments, which featured native boxers throughout the Pacific Northwest.
Even after he hung up his gloves, Mr. Campbell was not someone to mess with. Mr. John recalls a time when native leaders from across Canada were gathered in Ottawa for talks on the Constitution. Mr. Campbell became so incensed at the ribbing B.C. delegates were taking from other delegates in the bar one night that he challenged the worst of the verbal taunters. "This guy didn't know Ernie was a boxer," says Mr. John. "Ernie put him through the plate glass window."
Mr. Campbell met Carol at a dance on her home reserve of Chehalis in the Fraser Valley. He was 16. She was 15. "God, you're beautiful," the young man told her, and that was that. The couple married just after Mr. Campbell turned 20. They had four children.
He leaves his wife Carol, children Charlene, Ronda, Cary and Jocelyn, brothers Benjamin and Dunstan, sisters Darlene and Brenda, and three grandchildren.
'His priority was always to be ... serving the people'
Mr. Campbell spent much of his initial working life with Wright's Rope, an industrial shop by the Fraser. In 1973, however, he took out a loan, bought a big yellow school bus and turned that into a lifetime job.
The hours left time for coaching, where he began to forge his leadership abilities. He was strict, demanding his charges take their activities seriously or quit.
During war canoe season, paddlers had to give up smoking, drinking and eating junk food. They trained at 5 a.m. and 5 p.m. On the dot. Latecomers were reamed out by their no-nonsense coach.
Brian Sparrow raced for six seasons. "One morning I told Ernie I had a cold, I couldn't breathe through my nose. He said, 'Get in the goddamned truck. You don't pull with your nose.' So he had me there," Mr. Sparrow says with a laugh.
But Mr. Campbell was not without a sense of humour. His reaction to a drubbing at a soccer tournament in Victoria during the Musqueam team's first year has become reserve lore. The coach looked over his downcast, mud-spattered squad in the dressing room. He began pointing at them. "You're handsome. You're handsome ...," he said. "Now look at those other guys. He's ugly. He's ugly ... We may have lost 8-0, but we're the best-looking team in the tournament." Then he added the kicker. "And I'll tell you another thing. You'll never get out-coached."
As chief, Mr. Campbell met a host of world figures, including members of Britain's Royal Family. During a Musqueam tour by Princess Anne, Mr. Campbell reminded officious royal aides that the Musqueam had their protocol, too. The Princess laughed.
But no hobnobbing with the elite could turn him away from where his heart lay. "His priority was always to be back home, to be on the ground, serving the people in Musqueam," says Ms. Grant-John. "It was something you see in very few leaders. Usually, they get absorbed by the bigger picture. Not Ernie."
One of his proudest moments took place during the first day of the 2010 Olympic torch run in British Columbia. The fabled flame was brought to shore by Mr. Campbell. Dressed in full native regalia, he held the torch high while war canoe paddlers carried him across Victoria Harbour for the official ceremony in front of the legislature.
The majesty of the event put Mr. Campbell in a rare, reflective mood as he rode back on the ferry with other Musqueam. Johnna Sparrow Crawford was among them. "I remember he said to us: 'Who would have thought we'd be standing there at a world event like that? Being received in such a way was something our ancestors could never ever have imagined.' It was a touching moment," she said.

Abstract: "When you dig up coal or oil or natural gas that's been buried underground for millions of years, and then you burn it, you're adding new [carbon dioxide] to the atmosphere. When you take ethanol that's made from a corn kernel, that corn kernel took the CO2 that was already in the atmosphere."

Full text:   Ken Field, lead shareholder and chairman of Greenfield Specialty Alcohols Inc.
Ken Field's first career, as a real estate developer, should have prepared him for the flak he'd take in his second one, as lead shareholder and chairman of Canada's largest ethanol producer.
As president of Toronto-based Bramalea Inc., Mr. Field handled his share of outraged opposition as he overcame height-restrictions in cities like Dallas, and tore up neighbourhoods to build shopping malls in the Toronto area.
But after selling his stake in Bramalea, Mr. Field saw an opportunity in the industrial alcohol business and - armed with generous government subsidies - he built Greenfield Specialty Alcohols Inc. into a renewable-fuel powerhouse that is now moving aggressively into next-generation cellulosic ethanol.
The affable entrepreneur combines a missionary's zeal with a businessman's discipline to lead one of Canada's most successful private companies and largest renewable energy producers.
"My whole life I've picked up my armour and gone out and fought for what I think is right," he said. "But what I do now is tougher than what I did as a developer. Because, wherever you go, the first question is: Are you starving people in Africa? Are you increasing the price of my food? Is there a greenhouse gas benefit?" (The Coles Notes version of his answers: No, no and yes.)
Expecting revenue of $800-million this year from Greenfield's ethanol, animal feed and industrial alcohol businesses, the company he leads is now delving into new ventures, including next-generation biofuels made from agricultural wastes, and compressed natural gas, which is trucked to industries that currently rely on expensive diesel.
In the face of widespread criticism of the ethanol industry, Mr. Field argues passionately that Greenfield provides tremendous public benefit: creating a market for local farmers while producing a fuel that displaces imported oil, lowers the greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles and is cheaper than gasoline.
The company name - recommended by a public relations firm - is apt. He sees his second career as the greening of Mr. Field.
Over a lunch of shrimp cocktail and crab cakes in his 14th-floor boardroom just east of Toronto's financial district, Mr. Field could barely find time to eat as he expounded on the virtues of ethanol, the wrongheadedness of its critics, and the insidiousness of the oil companies who, he said, are largely behind the opposition to it. (Although, he needs to be careful, he added sotto voce, because the oil companies are also his customers.)
And on this day at least, he was feeling some vindication. Greenfield Specialty Alcohols was nominated for a private business growth award in a competition run by the Canadian Chamber of Commerce and Grant Thornton LLP, and the awards dinner was to be held that evening. Mr. Field knew he was the winner - he was preparing his acceptance speech and testing out his themes on me.
He certainly makes no apologies for using corn for fuel. The corn Greenfield uses is not the table variety, but industrial grain used in food processing, in animal feed and in alcohol.
Ethanol producers use a small portion of the grain, removing only the carbohydrates to make the ethanol but preserving the proteins and fibre in distillers grain, which is then used in animal feed.
The North American animal feed market is now saturated with distillers grain, and Greenfield is now exporting it to Japan.
He argues the price of corn is a minuscule component of the average grocery bill, even of a box of Corn Flakes. While there was an outcry against ethanol when a U.S. drought drove corn prices to above $8 (U.S.) a bushel last year, there has been little apparent relief for consumers now that they sit at $4.15 a bushel.
Still, it is not just an oil company conspiracy that has raised concerns about ethanol and the touchy food-versus-fuel debate, as he suggests. The United Nations' Food and Agriculture Organization regularly sounds the alarm that the growing demand for both corn and sugar for use as fuel has driven up the price of those commodities.
While he defends the use of corn, Mr. Field is most excited about the company's ventures in cellulosic ethanol. The next-generation ethanol is the holy grail of the biofuels industry, allowing producers to produce high-grade fuel from agricultural waste.
It is also a much-hyped technology: The joke in the industry is that a commercial breakthrough is always just around the corner. "The corner is now here," Mr. Field proclaimed over lunch.
Greenfield has partnered with Montreal-based Enerkem Inc. to build a cellulosic ethanol plant in Varennes, Que., to produce biofuels from non-recyclable municipal solid waste. But it is the company's own technological breakthrough at its Chatham, Ont., plant that has Mr. Field talking about transforming the energy world.
Backed by the federal government's Sustainable Technology Development Corp., Greenfield has developed and constructed a demonstration version of an extruding technology for preparing straw, corn stover and other material to be processed into ethanol.
"The way we invented this is ingenious, and it is going to change the world. That's why I'm so thrilled and so passionate about this industry," he said.
The company is now talking to major multinationals about licensing the technology, which he believes will make cellulosic ethanol competitive with gasoline. All that is needed now, he said, is for North American auto makers to market vehicles that run on either ethanol and gasoline, as they do in Brazil.
Mr. Field is at heart a builder, rather than a manager.
A graduate of the University of Toronto and York University's Osgoode Hall Law School, he left real estate law as a young man to help build Bramalea into one of North America's largest developers. When he left Bramalea in 1988, it had, over 20 years, been the best-performing stock on the Toronto Stock Exchange. A person who invested $1 in Bramalea in 1969 could have cashed out with $12,000 in 1989. (The company went bankrupt five years later after the 1990-91 recession sent real estate into a tailspin.)
He lets his managers run their various businesses, including an expanding industrial alcohol operation that has 70 per cent of the North American market and, among other products, supplies vodka to some very well known brands. (He can't say who - they put a lot of money into their marketing.)
He and his four-person executive team based in Toronto are responsible for launching new ventures. That includes a compressed natural gas business that has a deal with TransCanada Corp. to take gas off its mainline in Northern Ontario, and then compress it and ship it by truck to industrial users. Now, Greenfield is using the gas to generate steam for Bruce Power nuclear station.
It's no coincidence that he suggested we dine at Greenfield's 14th-floor conference room, rather than a nearby restaurant. Before I arrived, he asked what type of food I preferred and promised a fine meal.
Greenfield employs its own chef at the Toronto Street headquarters, but Mr. Field insisted she is no luxury for overindulged corporate executives. The management team has lunch together in the same boardroom nearly every day. And at each meal, they generate ideas, test concepts with their incisive peers and ensure they are generally moving in sync.
"We don't usually talk about the present; we talk about the future," Mr. Field said. "To me, that interaction is critical team building."

IN HIS OWN WORDS
On ethanol as an answer
to global warming "When you dig up coal or oil or natural gas that's been buried underground for millions of years, and then you burn it, you're adding new [carbon dioxide] to the atmosphere. When you take ethanol that's made from a corn kernel, that corn kernel took the CO2 that was already in the atmosphere."
On the future growth of
biofuels and opposition
from the oil industry "There is enough biomass in North America to replace all the gasoline that's being used now [with next-generation ethanol]. So if you were the oil industry, and you knew this was coming, what would you do?"

Full text:   The old storefront of the Star Sheet Metal Mfg. Co. hides a modern, spacious, light-filled studio and dwelling
THE LISTING
Asking price: $1.55-million
Taxes: $4,603.00 (2013)
Agent: Clive McLean (Bosley Real Estate Ltd.)
The back story
In the search for curb appeal, most house hunters would likely drive right by a gritty shop on Dundas Street West. But Tamira Sawatzky and Elle Flanders were instantly intrigued by a building with a vintage sign heralding Star Sheet Metal Mfg. Co. above the storefront window.
Inside, they found a long, narrow space, with its shelves crammed full of tools, machinery and pieces of fabricated metal.
"It was an actual sheet-metal shop," says Ms. Sawatzky. "Everything was full of elbows and angles."
At the time, Ms. Sawatzky, an architect with a residential practice, and Ms. Flanders, an artist and filmmaker, had decided to combine their talents into a venture named Public Studio. They needed a live-work space where they could pursue photography and architecture - both individually and in collaboration.
For Ms. Sawatzky, who studied architecture at the University of Manitoba, it wasn't difficult to envision the semi-industrial interior as a light-filled studio and dwelling.
The couple spent about one year renovating and moved in April, 2012.
The house today
With the Star Sheet Metal sign still attached to the façade and graffiti surrounding the entrance way, passers-by might not even notice that the space beyond the new glazing has been transformed into a modern and open studio/dining room.
A long, narrow table near the window serves as a work table at some times and the setting for lively dinner parties at others.
Beyond the dining area is a kitchen with an 18-foot-long white-marble island. The kitchen's cabinets and storage nooks were built into the space under the stairs. That allows for an uncluttered room and - on the opposite side - an expanse of wall that displays a rotating gallery of images.
At the rear, a rickety shed gave way to a spacious living room that sits a few steps below the kitchen level. Steel beams were built in to reinforce the structure.
"We blew this all open and opened up the back," says Ms. Sawatzky, gesturing to a wall of glass and wood, with oversized windows and sliding glass doors leading to the garden.
In the living room, built-in shelves are lined with books. Despite the open plan, the couple found many creative ways to add built-in cabinets and shelves throughout the house, adds Ms. Sawatzky.
"Storage is really important."
Outside, a deck is an extension of the living room.
A shed at the end of the garden is painted a vivid shade of orange to stop the eye and keep the space from feeling too narrow, says Ms. Sawatzy.
The banister on the stairs leading to the second floor was designed by Ms. Sawatzky and created by a local shop.
The wall behind the stairs had such an interesting combination of painted surfaces and textures that the couple opted not to refinish it. Now it stands as a reminder of the building's history.
Upstairs, the master bedroom at the rear of the house has a wall of windows overlooking a green roof that sit on top of the living-room addition.
To create closets and bathrooms on the long and narrow second floor, the couple built a rectangular box along one wall.
The space is divided to create a walk-in closet, a master bathroom with a steam room and a guest bathroom. They salvaged and reused the lath from the plaster walls of the metal shop as a wall treatment for the structure.
At the front, a studio that doubles as a guest bedroom overlooks the street.
On the third floor, the couple created a separate apartment that provides rental income.
The best feature
"Our studio doubles as our dining room," says Ms. Sawatzky, who says the large, north-facing window brings in lots of light during the day and the ambience of Dundas Street West at night.
The house is very quiet and sheltered from any street noise, she adds, but sometimes the pair deliberately brings in the neighbourhood vibe.
The neighbourhood is "hip and groovy" without the commotion of Dundas and Ossington, says Ms. Flanders.
During the evening, they often roll the window shade right up so they feel like a part of the Little Portugal street scene, says Ms. Sawatzky.
"It's like feeling you're a part of something. It feels like you're in the world."

The rushing tributaries of the Don River have sculpted the landscapes of several scenic Toronto neighbourhoods, though none of these residential districts is more lovely than Hoggs Hollow. Densely forested, with deep ravines, the area cries out for housing that mindfully responds to the rugged natural beauty round about.
Unfortunately, designers have not always given Hoggs Hollow the architectural respect it's asking for.
I am thinking specifically of a home I visited there not long ago. Put up about 40 years ago on one of the neighbourhood's narrow streets, this family dwelling cast in an indifferent Arts and Crafts manner was probably too large for its site. Worse still, the architect decided, for some reason, to turn the structure's blind side toward the picturesque Don branch that runs along one edge of the property. None of it - the style, the size, the orientation - made sense in its attractive context.
The couple who now own the house, however, saw potential in their place, and so decided to do something about realizing it. For openers, they bought and demolished the residence next door, thereby giving the house the room it needed to breathe. And they hired the Toronto firm of LGA Architectural Partners - known, until recently, as Levitt Goodman Architects - to plan out a complete revision of both the original house and the grounds. The couple's intention, LGA's Janna Levitt said, was to create a "healthy, restorative, responsible place" for their own enjoyment and that of their four married children and nine grandchildren.
The result of LGA's efforts, together with those of landscape architect Scott Torrance, is an interesting house-and-garden complex that offers its owners and users a wide variety of hospitable experiences, especially in the warm months of the year.
A meandering path leads the casual wanderer through beds planted with tall grasses and flowers for every season, and along the edge of the stream. A hot tub and a rock-ribbed saltwater swimming pool invite dips and plunges in whatever weather, and there is an ample sand pit and a grassy patch for garden sports. Stands of trees shelter and shade the house's street-side façade.
In fashioning these renewed outdoor spaces, Ms. Levitt said, the owners recycled material where feasible - the remnants of the demolished next-door house, for example, were donated to Habitat for Humanity - and they remediated parts of the property, such as the river bank, that had long been neglected. The project, especially the fabrication of the outside elements, involved restoration and preservation, and co-operation with the natural and built facts of this small urban precinct.
Such co-operation is nowhere more obvious than in the treatment of the original house. The story of local residential architecture surely would not have suffered a loss had LGA and their clients decided to knock it down and start over from scratch.
They chose, instead, to build on what was there. LGA pushed out the rear toward the flower garden and the pool, for instance, adding a glass-walled living and dining room that opens up the formerly closed house to the natural and civilized beauties in the vicinity. Expansive terraces extend outward on two sides of the house, linking the interior to the river and the various exterior zones dedicated to playing, relaxing, dining.
The outcome of these various moves is a marriage of new and old that saves and enhances what was good about the original building, such as the horizontal lines and the deep overhang of the eaves. But LGA's gestures have also transformed it from a quite ordinary house into a garden pavilion suitable for a large family whose members like to enjoy life together.
That said, I can't give this project an unqualified thumbs-up, because of questions that nagged me when I visited the place, and have been on my mind since. Was it really necessary to program every square foot of the site so carefully? With sand boxes, hot tubs, decks and so on, is there simply too much going on? The answers may come down to taste, although I would like to hear the views of an expert designer of playgrounds on the matter.
But on the question of the general success of the scheme, I have no doubt. Scott Torrance and the architectural team from LGA - Janna Levitt, Eric Cunnington and Allison Janes - have brought vitality and vigour to a tired swatch of urban fabric that needed it, and effectively restored the dignity of a small extent of our wonderful Don River system of waterways.

Prized High Park location has builder seeing green

Daniels' HighPark Condominiums is going to make it easy for buyers to get their daily dose of green.
*****
The infill development will not only overlook treed streets and nearly 400 acres of parkland, but it will also provide community gardening plots and agricultural programs led by local farmers.
"It's an amazing location right across the entrance of High Park - on the north side of Bloor between Pacific [Avenue] and Oakmount [Road] - so the views you're getting from the building are just spectacular and you're steps from Bloor West Village and a block to the High Park and Keele subway stops," says Dominic Tompa, a broker of record for CityLife Realty, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of the developer, Daniels Corp.
"When you're purchasing a home, you're buying bricks and mortar, but you're also buying a lifestyle, so we're trying to enhance that lifestyle for people."
A notable initiative in the 14-storey building will be the partnership with Cutting Veg - an organic farm in Sutton, Ont., - that will assist residents in cultivating their garden plots.
"People who haven't lived in condos before want to get some of the same lifestyle benefits they had in a detached home or what they grew up in, but traditionally can't in a highrise condominium," says Mr. Tompa, who's seen the popularity of gardening plots in Daniels' projects in Regent Park and Mississauga.
"It's wonderful to see them harvest the food and it brings people together when they make meals with it."
Alternatively, a bike-sharing program, bike clinics, tune-ups and planned excursions will encourage residents to explore the area's natural assets.
"We've seen no one else do this, but then again we like to lead when it comes to creating new amenities," says Mr. Tompa.
Other urban attractions in this glass-and-brick building will include retail space to complement shops and restaurants nearby, along with 18,000 square feet of space for a private dog wash station; a second-floor theatre, weight room and climbing wall; and a third-floor cardio studio, yoga areas, party room and terrace.
On the 10th floor, an indoor/outdoor party facility will contain a kitchen, fireside lounges and barbecue area.
"Regardless of where your exposure is for the suite you're purchasing, you're able to use this wonderful outdoor space overlooking the trees in the park," Mr. Tompa adds.
However, most residents will have some form of private outdoor space. "Very few suites have Juliet balconies, but other than that every suite has a balcony," Mr. Tompa explains. "What's unique is some of our incredible-sized terraces that overlook the south, east and west side of the building. There are a few that go up over 600 square feet for the terraces alone."
To move buyers in as soon as the summer of 2015, sales began in September after construction commenced on the mid-rise, which will house 389 suites with studio to three-bedroom plans and 12 two-storey townhouses at street level.
"Across Bloor West Village, there have been other condominiums developed, but being able to be right across from the park like that, the demand has been huge," Mr. Tompa sayas.
"We have a registrant list with almost 5,000 people, which is double what we normally see when we release a condominium."
Standard finishes will include quartz kitchen counters, stainless steel appliances and marble-topped bathroom vanities and porcelain floors.
Monthly fees will be 53 cents per square feet. Parking will be $32,000 and locker $3,500.

Full text:   There are a variety of ways to dip into this type of investment, but deciding where to invest and when takes homework
Duddy Kravitz's grandfather put it this way: "A man without land is nothing." In today's ever-roiling economy, should men and women take his advice as it relates to investing in property?
The fictional character in Mordecai Richler's Canadian literary classic The Apprenticeship of Duddy Kravitz was talking about actual, physical property with dirt and trees. Today's sophisticated investor who is interested in real estate has a number of more abstract products and investment instruments to choose from.
Investors can consider everything from income-generating property and buildings, to development company stocks or bonds, funds or real estate investment trusts (REITs). And, while it's not necessarily recommended by the experts, they can look anywhere in the world to invest in real estate.
Should you invest in real estate? Is this a good time to do so? And if you decide to become a real estate investor, what's the best way to go about it?
"As a starting point, any investor should ask: Are you an active or a passive investor?" says Frank Margani, executive vice-president of Fortress Real Developments, headquartered in Richmond Hill, Ont.
"In the context of global real estate, it's particularly important."
While some people have higher tolerance for risk and a hunger for higher, though more speculative, returns, Mr. Margani paraphrases a principle of the organic food movement: Think locally before you act globally.
"I'm a believer in local real estate," he says. "If you can touch it, stand on it, visit it, you know what you're getting."
Mr. Margani says he believes in buying locally or regionally even for investors who aren't investing directly in a particular property. His company offers syndicated mortgage products - funds that investors buy into to create a pool of mortgage funds for specific development projects.
Worldwide real estate is tempting, admits Mr. Margani, who has experience in the property sectors in Dubai , among other places. There are opportunities in Brazil, for example, and even in recession-plagued Europe, industrial property in Germany has lots of potential upside.
"It's also true that there are strong markets around the world, and there are fantastic opportunities in certain parts of the United States," he says.
He cites U.S. regions where there is a strong national defence infrastructure - military bases, defence industries and all the services that go along with these.
But he still calls for caution.
"You really need the guidance of experts in these areas," he says. "It requires a high level of due diligence in those markets, by someone who can look at past investments there and see what they did."
He compares the U.S. real estate market to "a giant bear that's just waking up from hibernation." It may turn into a boom, "but most people would not want to wake up underneath a bear just as it's waking up."
REITs are a reasonable way to invest in real estate now, says Himalaya Jain, director of Canadian equities at ScotiaMcLeod's Portfolio Advisory Group in Toronto.
Real estate "is one of the sectors we're actually bullish on right now," and while REITs don't generally have high growth rates, they're relatively stable, Mr. Jain says.
"Even taking into account the recession of 2008 and 2009, REITs did very well. Very few had to cut dividends."
REITs tend to be solid, if unspectacular, in their growth because the real estate portfolios they own tend to be leased to tenants over the long term.
"The benefit is that when the economy becomes soft, you can also rely on those leases that are with creditworthy tenants," Mr. Jain says.
Nevertheless, REITs are tied closely to interest rates and bond rates, he adds. With recent announcements and signals from the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Bank of Canada, it looks like the outlook for short-term rates and long-term government bond yields can be expected to be stuck in neutral, Mr. Jain's Portfolio Advisory Group suggests.
Picking up on the buy locally theme, he notes that in retail commercial property there is now a mini-flurry of activity, with the announcement on Oct. 29 by Sears Canada that it is selling five of its leases in prime locations, including Toronto's flagship Eaton Centre.
This suggests that there will be competition and demand in higher-end retail space, as major department stores compete for good locations.
"The No. 1 rule in property is, and always has been: location, location, location," Mr. Jain says. This is as true for REITs and syndicated mortgage holders as it is for investors in individual properties.
Another thing to look at when investing in real estate, in any form, is the asset class, Mr. Jain says.
Many REITs focus on different asset classes, or types of property, he explains - for example: retail, office or industrial space, or multi-family units (apartment buildings), seniors' housing and lodging (hotels). Despite vast numbers of building cranes in markets such as Toronto, Vancouver or Calgary, there are relatively few rental apartments going up, because it's more worthwhile for developers to build condos, Mr. Jain says.
Mr. Margani says that when investors from around the world look for the best real estate investments, they often turn to Canada.
"We've got the G7's lowest debt-to-GDP ratio, the safest banks and Canada has led the G7 countries in growth," he says.

Full text:   Filipino immigrants, most of whom work as caregivers, continue to wait for news of relatives they left behind
DEMOGRAPHICS REPORTER
Every morning for the past week, Nilda Lamoridan would take her employer's children to school and then hurry home to watch the latest news from the Philippines.
For days, she scanned the images, looking at bodies, peering at those on foot or searching for food and water, wondering if that might be her own daughter, Maybelle. She was too anxious to sleep. Her daughter lives just outside Tacloban, the coastal city that was nearly wiped away by Typhoon Haiyan. The last she heard from her was an exchange of text messages before the storm's 300-kilometre-per-hour winds whipped through the area on Friday, Nov 8. Finally, she persuaded a cousin to brave a treacherous six-hour journey by motorcycle to find out if her only child is still alive.
Ms. Lamoridan works as a live-in caregiver in Toronto. She is employed by a middle-class family and helps raise their children. Like many other Filipina women in Canada, she came here alone, leaving her daughter in the Philippines to be raised by a cousin. She describes it as a painful choice. It's like a wound that never really heals, she said. While being so far from her daughter makes her anxious even in good times, it's almost unbearable at a moment of crisis.
"It's like watching while they're drowning. It's so far away. What can you do? You can only pray," Ms. Lamoridan says. "It's helpless."
The Philippines is now Canada's largest source of immigrants. Somewhere between a quarter and a third of Filipinos in Canada come either as caregivers or their dependents, according to geographer Philip Kelly of York University (just 44 per cent of Filipino Canadians are male). There is significant demand for their labour. As an aging society with uneven access to daycare, there are a great many families and communities that need caregivers. And the Philippines produces them. It encourages its young graduates to go abroad, hailing them as heroes and building training academies and recruitment agencies to facilitate migration. The remittances they send back every year, including $2-billion from Canada, are the equivalent of 10 per cent of the national GDP. Every family needs at least one foreign worker just to bear local prices for education and real estate, Prof. Kelly said. But the consequences are borne by the children left behind. They usually live without a mother until their teen years. When the children eventually arrive in Canada, they tend to show lower levels of academic achievement than the children of other immigrant groups, Prof. Kelly said, as well as enduring other adjustment struggles.
Ms. Lamoridan's experience is common to many Filipina women in Canada. After graduation, she couldn't find work that suited her qualifications. She got a job at an orphanage in Manila and then at a pineapple processing plant, earning $3 a day.
"I needed to go find money to feed ourselves," she said.
In 2002, unmarried and with a seven-year-old daughter, she left for Hong Kong on her own. She worked there as a nanny until 2009, when she came to Canada. She sends her earnings home to support her sister and her daughter, whom she sees once every two years, typically for a month. It has been that way for 11 years. This year, Maybelle graduated from high school. The plan is to bring her to Canada once Ms. Lamoridan receives permanent residency, but her application, like thousands of others, has been mired in backlogs and delays.
The children she cares for in Toronto are like family to her. They call her Tita and rush into her bedroom to wake her in the morning. They don't know much about the tragedy that has hit her home country, she said. She tried to hide her anxiety as she waited for news of her daughter. The reports said thousands were killed around Tacloban.
"My boss, he cried. When he looks at me I can see his eyes and he wants to cry and I don't want to cry in front of him," she said. "When I'm alone and the kids are at school I look at the news. Then I burst out," she said.
Her cousin finally returned from his 12-hour journey to the area Tuesday morning with news that her daughter had survived, as had the cousin who looks after her. They were wet and hungry. Their house has been destroyed, the roof torn to pieces, their food gone. But they are alive, she said. She still hasn't spoken to her daughter, but she feels a sense of relief.
Now she's hoping to get her to Canada before the situation gets any worse. Canada has promised to fast track some visa applications from those areas hardest hit. It's not clear what that will mean for someone in her situation, still waiting for her mother's application to be processed.
Arlie Hochschild, a sociologist at the University of California, Berkeley who has studied what she calls the global chain of care, said governments should address the impact of the current system on the children of caregivers.
"If we want their labour, we should permit them to bring their children," Prof. Hochschild said.

Abstract: "The gap is just really huge between the rich and the working class," said Ms. [Joanne Davis], 38, standing outside her children's school. "I don't even know if there's a middle class any more. We're just working to make ends meet."

Full text:   Greenwich and Bridgeport are only 30 minutes apart on the Connecticut highway that joins them, but the chasm between them is huge. In a country considered the most unequal of major industrialized nations, Joanna Slater writes, these two cities provide a glimpse into just how extreme the wealth divide can be
The thing that attracted Joanne Davis to Connecticut was a road. One autumn day, she took a drive up the state's Merritt Parkway for the first time. The highway wound through a canopy of woods and sloped under ornamented bridges, passing through wealthy towns like Greenwich, New Canaan and Westport. She fell in love with the scenery and the fresh air and resolved to move.
Near the northern end of the highway sits Bridgeport, the gritty post-industrial city where Ms. Davis ended up. There her two children attend an elementary school that is ranked No. 502 out of 510 in the state based on test scores. Seven months ago, she lost her job, and the bank is about to foreclose on her apartment. She just started a new position as a paralegal, but it doesn't include benefits and pays a third less than she was earning before.
"The gap is just really huge between the rich and the working class," said Ms. Davis, 38, standing outside her children's school. "I don't even know if there's a middle class any more. We're just working to make ends meet."
To travel the chasm between rich and poor in the United States takes about 30 minutes, or the drive between Greenwich and Bridgeport. By the numbers, this slice of coastal Connecticut is the most unequal urban area in the country, boasting a degree of income inequality that resembles Thailand or Bolivia.
The extremes can be disorienting. On a recent Sunday in Bridgeport, the pastor of a local Baptist church talked in an interview about his fears of a "permanent underclass" and his worries that some of the city's children don't have access to decent-quality produce, let alone decent education. Half an hour down the road, there was an open house underway in Greenwich. Modest in comparison to its much larger neighbours, the home was selling for $4.5-million (U.S.) and featured a climate-controlled indoor pool area. A nearby forest preserve was excellent for walking or horseback riding, the real estate agent told me.
A new gilded age
The U.S. has always had income disparities, but over the last three decades the country has entered a new gilded age. In 2012, the top 10 per cent of earners took home half of the nation's total income, the highest share since modern records began in 1917, according to research by economists Emmanuel Saez and Thomas Piketty. Since the 1980s, the income of the top 1 per cent of earners, adjusted for inflation, has nearly tripled.
For Canada - grappling with a more moderate but increasing wealth gap - the U.S. represents one vision of the future. According to a commonly used measure of income inequality, the U.S. is the most unequal major industrialized nation on Earth. Among a broader group of 34 developed countries, it is fourth, surpassed only by Turkey, Mexico and Chile. (Canada, by contrast, is 12th.)
The same dynamics that are driving the growth of income inequality in Canada are also at work in the U.S., only in more extreme form: the disappearance of manufacturing jobs in a more globalized world, the decline of labour unions, the increase in pay for executives and bankers, the mismatch between the skills employers need and the ones workers have.
Experts disagree about whether today's income gap is a drag on U.S. economic growth, but there's little question that it coincides with other undesirable trends - such as lower upward mobility between generations and neighbourhoods increasingly segregated by income.
More broadly, Michael Sandel, a Harvard philosophy professor, has drawn attention to what he calls the "skyboxification of American life," a reference to the distinct, higher-priced boxes now common in sports stadiums. "People of influence and people of modest means lead increasingly separate lives," he wrote last year. "It's not good for democracy, nor is it a satisfying way to live."
In Bridgeport and Greenwich, the status quo appears entrenched. The income gap saturating the area is a fact of life, as likely to inspire indifference as anguish. In conversations, there was little anger and even less sense that substantial change was likely any time soon.
Connecticut as poster child
Every day, Juan Terron travels back and forth between the two extremes. He drives from his home in Bridgeport to Greenwich, where he works as a maintenance worker at a private school that sits on 20 acres of land and charges kindergarten tuition of $32,150.
"It's like entering a different world," said Mr. Terron, 57. "You see it in the houses and cars. Everything is owned, nothing is rented. You will never see any homeless people or drug addicts walking on the streets."
Within the U.S., Connecticut is the "poster child" for the growing income divide, said Stephen Adair, a sociology professor at Central Connecticut State University. "No other state compares in terms of the rate of growth in inequality" over the last four decades.
The most common measure of income inequality is the Gini coefficient, which is named after an Italian statistician. A perfectly equal distribution of income results in a score of 0 and a totally lopsided distribution - where one person gets everything - produces a score of 1.
The metropolitan area that is home to Bridgeport, Greenwich, Stamford and Norwalk - a string of cities and towns hugging the ocean with 927,000 residents - had a Gini coefficient of .54 over the three-year period between 2010 and 2012, according to the latest figures from the U.S. census. That's the highest of any urban centre in the nation.
In Bridgeport, 35 per cent of households earned less than $25,000 a year and just 2 per cent earned more than $200,000. In Greenwich, the picture is nearly the opposite: 35 per cent of families earned more than $200,000 a year, while 9.8 per cent earned less than $25,000. The disparities also reflect the still-considerable economic gaps between races in the U.S.: the residents of Greenwich are predominantly white, while the majority of Bridgeport's population identifies as black or Hispanic.
Mr. Terron immigrated to the U.S. from Mexico. His wife Maria works cleaning rooms at the local Holiday Inn. His two daughters, now 24 and 18, went to public schools in Bridgeport. The education they received bears no resemblance to what he sees each day at work: concerts, swimming lessons, holiday events, the latest teaching technologies, opportunities to study abroad during the summer.
"In all of the years that my daughters attended schools in Bridgeport, they never had any of that," he said. Instead, they came home with stories of fights between students or pupils who brought a weapon to school. "It's just not fair because not everyone has the same opportunities."
In Bridgeport, nearly 40 per cent of children live in poverty. According to a report from the Bridgeport Child Advocacy Coalition, 99 per cent of the students in the city's public schools are what it terms "economically disadvantaged" - or come from families earning less than 185 per cent of the poverty level.
Research indicates that educational outcomes are increasingly linked to family incomes. Sean Reardon, an education professor at Stanford University, found that the gap on standardized tests between rich and poor U.S. students is about 40-per-cent larger than it was 30 years ago. What's more, he has noted, students from affluent families are outperforming not just their peers from poor families, but those from middle-class families as well.
Once thriving, now struggling
Pastor Anthony Bennett has spent nearly two decades in Bridgeport leading Mount Aery Baptist Church, a 90-year-old institution in a neighbourhood known as "the Hollow." The older members of his church remember when the city was a thriving manufacturing hub, home to factories making sewing machines, electrical components, trucks and turbines.
"There is almost an envy I have of them, because they grew up in an era, in the 40s, 50s and 60s, when Bridgeport was a strong city," said Mr. Bennett, who is engaged in numerous initiatives to tackle the city's problems.
The manufacturers have nearly all fled, decimating Bridgeport's tax base. In recent years, efforts to rejuvenate the dilapidated downtown area have gained some traction. Locals proudly note that Elton John recently performed at the city's arena, built to draw economic activity - and residents from prosperous neighbouring towns - into Bridgeport.
It remains a long slog. Ms. Davis, the mother of two, lives on the east side of town. A main intersection features a pawn shop, a cheque-cashing outlet, a small convenience store and a Subway sandwich shop with a sign advertising that it accepts food stamps, the nutritional assistance program for poorer Americans.
Willie Roy Edwards, a retiree who lives in subsidized housing, was pushing a shopping cart filled with assorted pieces of metal toward a nearby scrap yard on Knowlton Street. He makes the ten-kilometre round trip from his home two or three times a week. His haul this time: $47.
Mr. Edwards has lived in Bridgeport for nearly 50 years, working at car dealerships, though he almost never went to the wealthier precincts beyond the city. "I've been out there, but just passing through," he said. "They have their own standards of who they want to associate with."
Among the Super Zips
Upon leaving Bridgeport, a different landscape emerges. Just outside the city marks the start of a string of what social scientist Charles Murray has called "Super Zips": American postal codes full of the nation's best-educated and best-compensated workers. Other such large clusters of "Super Zips" can be found near Washington, D.C., in Silicon Valley, and on the east side of Manhattan, for instance.
One such postal code in this area belongs to Greenwich, a town of 62,000 residents where the median household income is $134,000. The main shopping thoroughfare is home to Hermès, Tiffany, Saks Fifth Avenue and an Apple store. Along a side street, there is a boutique called Splurge. On another major avenue is a series of car showrooms: Porsche, Mercedes-Benz, Aston Martin, Maserati.
It's a place long associated with the barons of the financial industry, whether in banking, insurance, or, more recently, hedge funds. Roughly a quarter of the increase in the share of income going to the top 1 per cent of Americans since 1979 can be traced to rising pay in finance, according to a recent report from Capital Economics.
Changes in the tax code have also helped the wealthy: Starting in the 1980s, the U.S. began reducing the income-tax rate for the highest earners from 70 per cent to 35 per cent. Hedge fund managers and private-equity investors also benefit from a particular loophole, which allows their income to be taxed at the same rate as capital gains - or 20 per cent for those in the highest tax bracket.
On a recent evening, the Chamber Players of the Greenwich Symphony held a concert at the Bruce Museum, an imposing building on a hill high above town. The museum's honorary trustees include Richard Fuld, the former chief executive of Lehman Brothers, and Steven Cohen, the hedge-fund billionaire whose firm, SAC Capital Advisors, recently pleaded guilty to criminal charges of insider trading (both Mr. Fuld and Mr. Cohen own homes in Greenwich).
The program for the concert lists the pieces to be played, but also a series of suggestions on tax-efficient ways to donate to the chamber music group. Giving securities rather than cash avoids all capital gains taxes and allows the donor to claim a deduction, it notes, concluding with a reminder to consult with a tax adviser before making any decisions.
At a wine-and-cheese reception during intermission, I ask Reba Beeson, a lawyer and longtime Greenwich resident, what locals gripe about. She thinks for a moment. "The weather," she answers. There are storms and, rarely, hurricanes that can knock out power lines. She pauses, then adds: "There's really not much to complain about."
Back in Bridgeport, Ms. Davis finished dropping her children off from school and began preparing for her first day of work at her new job in nearby Stamford. She fears that the recession has permanently altered the economy, together with the earning potential of people like her.
As for her eight-year-old daughter and six-year-old son, she wants them to become decent, compassionate human beings and hopes for them to go to college like she did. But she's uneasy. "I do worry about them and what kind of opportunities they're going to have."

Full text:   With the Heinz factory closing, Leamington residents fear the small Ontario town will die
Like Leamington has for the past century, Tracy Tucker and her family have relied on H.J. Heinz Co.
The dark-haired 29-year-old moved to Leamington, "the Tomato Capital of Canada," a town that grew and thrived over more than 100 years of tomato farming - to work at the Heinz factory after both of her parents got full-time positions. Her uncle left high school to start working at the plant 30 years ago. And her brother-in-law was just recently hired.
Ms. Tucker bought a new SUV six months ago, a new house three months ago and is seven months pregnant, but now is months away from being laid off - along with 739 other full-time workers, 200 seasonal workers and most of her family and friends. She said the small Ontario town is destined to die.
"I'm glad I didn't paint the baby's room," Ms. Tucker says. "Everybody I've talked to is leaving town."
Ms. Tucker and her family have not wasted any time: Her parents listed their new house last night - one among many of the panicked locals calling real estate agents to sell houses - and Ms. Tucker plans to do the same thing, as well as returning her car. She still hasn't told her 10-year-old daughter, but she plans to move to B.C., where she thinks her fiancé's asphalt business will thrive, instead of struggling for business in a declining small town. Her sister, Sarah Crawford, who plans to move to Saskatoon, feels bitterly about the now-worthless pension documents her husband was given earlier in the week - which hinted at a future here. "Bastards," she mutters. Their parents will move back to Newfoundland, where the family is from, because they can't yet retire and can't see a future in Leamington that isn't tied to tomatoes.
Because in Leamington, tomatoes were everything: They were jobs at the plant for workers and lucrative plants in the field for farmers; they required labels from local factories and gave shipping contracts to local trucking companies; they were a way of life and a sense of identity and they sustained the town as many other small towns died. And now that Heinz is leaving, there is no reason to grow tomatoes any more and that is a truly heartbreaking idea in Leamington. The town has a vibrant downtown and a greenhouse industry that doesn't feed into Heinz, but folks aren't kidding themselves that this week hasn't been brutal for the community.
In 1909, Henry John Heinz selected Leamington, with its fertile soil, transportation links and the most southerly climate Canada can muster, as the place for a tomato processing plant to make his famous ketchup. Local farmers got $25-million worth of contracts to grow tomatoes each year and that money trickled down through suppliers and workers to provide middle-class livelihoods for thousands of people over the years. The firm's engineers built the giant metal-and-fibreglass tomato that acts as a town tourist booth, and Heinz also sponsors the annual Tomato Festival in August, as well as the Ketchup to Art Show, where some artists paint with ketchup.
Leamington's farmers have had tomatoes in their soil and in their blood for more than a century, but they've always known the factory could close. Tomatoes are harvested ripe and don't travel well, so if there's no processing plant, there's no tomato growing. Farmers will now likely grow other crops.
Walter Brown, who has grown tomatoes for Heinz for 47 years, like his father before him, has a barn full of tomato-specific equipment that he doubts he can sell - given the region's 46 growers are also likely to sell their equipment all at the same time. And he has a tomato field that is already fertilized and bedded at a cost of $25,000 that will not receive any tomatoes. He says that, around the time NAFTA was negotiated, Heinz asked Leamington farmers to get globally competitive by bringing up yields, which required them spending millions on better machinery and irrigation that are not required for other crops.
"Everybody's going to suffer," Mr. Brown said. "Tomatoes over the years have paid a lot of bills."
But more than a hundred years after the plant opened in Leamington, in a time of global capital flows and North America's disappearing middle-class jobs, Heinz's new owners are a Brazilian private equity firm called 3G Capital and Berkshire Hathaway's Warren Buffet.
Dennis Jackson prefers the past. He's a Heinz memorabilia collector who started working at Heinz in quality control on Dec. 17, 1964. Shortly after retiring in 2000, he lost his wife to cancer and the company offered him a job running Heinz's gift shop. His old uniform is now on a mannequin in the permanent Heinz collection at the Leamington Arts Centre, which sells a T-shirt that says, "I put ketchup on my ketchup" along with a book commemorating Heinz's centennial in the town.
"It's a new era and this is an old place," Mr. Jackson said, standing in front of the factory and the 1949 pickup he had refurbished with Heinz logos, which he drives in the Tomato Festival parade he now thinks might be too depressing to hold this year. "It's been nothing but the best company in the world to work for. [The closing is] because of the new, modern ways of making money."
But it is not as if Leamington, which has struggled through nearby Windsor's travails in the auto industry's restructuring, is a stranger to industrial decline. Scott Graham moved here as a 13-year-old because his dad came for an auto-industry job. He's watched the region struggle through the recession and seen and other factories close. "It's like this area is being punched in the face when everything was recovering," said Mr. Graham, who co-owns a Century 21 office that he says has received panicked calls for listings in the wake of Heinz's Thursday announcement. He, like the mayor, thinks things will be okay.
But there is still a lot of pain, anger and disbelief in Leamington, despite the memories, which makes the mood feel sort of like a communal divorce. Employees said the meeting with unionized staff got heated, with tossed chairs and a lot of swearing.
The town has some industries that don't rely on Heinz. Two Highline Mushroom facilities in Leamington employ about 700 people. The community also forms the largest concentration of greenhouses in Canada, possibly North America, growing fresh produce all year that goes to grocery stores, not processing plants.
Maria Harms, who works in the greenhouse industry and picked tomatoes as a young girl, was sipping a glass of red wine on the evening of the closing announcement at Jose's, a local bar and grill. "It's going to affect businesses like this," she says. "People will be going out less. They'll be watching their dollar." As she's about to leave, she receives a text from a friend in the auto industry who's been laid off. "Does Heinz affect greenhouse at all?" it reads. She shrugs and then she laughs.

Full text:   When staffers in Rob Ford's office suspected the mayor of abusing drugs and drinking and driving last year, it was chief of staff Mark Towhey they confided in. And when the mayor arrived at the Garrison Ball in February "flustered, agitated and flushed," it was again Mr. Towhey, the mayor's trusted lieutenant, who was left to handle the situation.
For years, city hall watchers knew Mr. Towhey as the mayor's policy adviser-turned chief of staff, who often appeared at Mr. Ford's side during key council votes. But with the release of a police document this week, which detailed concerns about the mayor's alleged drug and alcohol use, it became clear that, when the mayor fired Mr. Towhey in May, he also lost one of the few people left who would stand up to him.
"It was never their job to say no to the mayor," Mr. Towhey told The Globe about other staffers in the mayor's office. "It's not their job to get in a fight with the chief magistrate. That's why I get paid."
The police document - its allegations have not been proven in court - outlines a number of incidents where staffers turned to Mr. Towhey for advice on how to deal with the mayor. On the night of the Garrison Ball, according to Mr. Towhey's interview with police, Mr. Towhey told an intoxicated mayor "if he attended this event that his career as a politician would be over."
On another occasion, Mr. Towhey told the mayor he wouldn't allow city staff to organize a pizza party for his football team. "The mayor became very angry and told Towhey to leave and not come back." The next day, Mr. Towhey was fired. Ann Hui
David Price
A long-time friend of the Ford brothers, Mr. Price became the mayor's director of logistics in April. Mr. Ford's former spokesman, George Christopoulos, told police Mr. Price was hired at double the salary of others in the office. Mr. Price knows Fabio Basso, an occupant of the bungalow where the alleged crack video is said to have been filmed, according to unredacted pages of a police document released Wednesday. Its allegations have not been proven in court. A Globe investigation revealed Mr. Price was a partner in a hash-dealing enterprise in the 1980s headed by the mayor's brother, Doug Ford. Doug has denied he ever dealt drugs. Mr. Price did not respond to a request for comment. When asked about Mr. Price's hiring, the mayor's brother said, "You can't teach loyalty." According to a since-removed LinkedIn profile, Mr. Price spent at least a decade at State Street Trust Company Canada.
Isaac Ransom
Mr. Ransom, who resigned from Mr. Ford's communication team in May, has been working as Councillor Peter Leon's executive assistant since October. In his interview with police, he said he arrived at the mayor's office in the early evening on St. Patrick's Day, 2012, and found his boss drinking vodka straight from the bottle and "totally out of it," the document says. Mr. Ransom worked as Councillor Gary Crawford's executive assistant, according to his LinkedIn profile. Mr. Ransom also worked as a campaign strategist on various local campaigns and as a constituency assistant for federal Liberal MP Scott Brison in his Nova Scotia riding in 2005. "His easy manner allowed him to deal with any constituent without any problem," said Mr. Brison's spokesman, Dale Palmater.
Christopher Fickel
Mr. Fickel first made headlines in 2012 when it was revealed the mayor relied on him (and his taxpayer-funded cellphone) to help administer the summer football teams Mr. Ford founded after winning office. Mr. Fickel told police he left the mayor's office to focus on a "joint business endeavour he has been working on involving a smart-phone application," the document says, adding "he wanted his life back and decided to resign." Mr. Fickel also told investigators he was in the mayor's vehicle when Mr. Ford pulled to the side of the road and removed a mickey of vodka from a paper bag. He said the mayor drank the vodka in less than two minutes. According to a Facebook page for a Chris Fickel who lists himself as former special assistant to the mayor, Mr. Fickel studied communications at Wilfred Laurier University and geography at York.
Kia Nejatian
Mr. Nejatian, the mayor's former executive assistant, is now a real estate analyst at Real Facilities Inc. in Toronto, his LinkedIn profile says. Mr. Nejatian, who told police he once discovered a marijuana cigarette in Mr. Ford's desk drawer, also said the mayor asked him to write a reference letter for Alessandro Lisi, an alleged drug dealer. "He was reluctant to write the letter," the document says. Mr. Nejatian was formerly a senior leasing manager at Varsity Properties and a communications assistant for Christine Elliott's 2009 campaign to become leader of the provincial Progressive Conservative party, his LinkedIn profile says. The mayor's former chief of staff, Mark Towhey, described Mr. Nejatian in his online recommendation as "one of the rare individuals to whom I could just hand a problem with little hope of solution, leave him alone, and come back to find it solved."
George Christopoulos
Mr. Christopoulos was among the employees present at a meeting with "inner circle staff" on May 17 - the day after reports of the alleged crack video first emerged, the police document says. Mr. Nejatian, Mr. Ransom, Mr. Towhey and Earl Provost, the mayor's current chief of staff, were also said to be present. Mr. Christopoulos had been hired to the mayor's office in early 2012 after "eight years of playing a key role in developing the Toronto Police Service's position on a full range of emerging and ongoing media issues," according to a statement released at the time. Earlier that year, Mr. Christopoulos was recognized with an award for his work in building bridges between the city's ethnic communities and police. In the summer, Mr. Christopoulos was announced as vice-president of communications for Toronto's Building Industry and Land Development Association.

Full text:   In Toronto, income inequality is the highest in Canada - and wealth and test scores are going hand in hand. Rich areas are home to high-scoring schools, while schools in poorer areas lag. A Globe analysis exposes the gap
It's a tale of two postal codes.
The Woods family - mom Kathy, dad Peter and daughter Naomi - lives in M1N 2T2 on Courcelette Road. It's a quiet street of well-tended homes approaching million-dollar price tags, at the eastern end of the Beaches. Standardized test scores at Courcelette Public School are among the highest in Toronto. Ten-year-old Naomi has taken piano, swimming and karate lessons. On Tuesday evenings, she and a friend have a standing date. They build video games, supervised by her web developer dad. Mr. Woods works from home and reads with his daughter every night (Ms. Woods, a business consultant, is often on the road but makes sure to Skype in). Naomi read the entire Harry Potter series before her seventh birthday.
Ten kilometres away in M1P 3N7, in the heart of Scarborough, third-grader Shazfa Noor comes home after attending Edgewood Public School and goes to the basement to play with her three siblings, watch television and use the computer. "I can't do soccer club or anything like that for all of them. I cannot afford that. It's too expensive for me," Latifa Sultana, Shazfa's mother said. Last year, Ms. Sultana noticed her daughter struggled with reading; Shazfa would skip words. Ms. Sultana asked the teacher but was told not to be concerned. She spent half an hour reading with Shazfa every evening and created a folder of rhyming words for Shazfa until she saw an improvement in the girl's skills.
Ms. Sultana stays home while her husband works as a chef. They immigrated from Bangladesh in 1999. They moved to the Edgewood neighbourhood four years ago from an apartment building in East York to give their children a neighbourhood and a house to grow up in.
In theory, Naomi and Shafza would have equal opportunities to do well in school, participate in extracurriculars and move on to university or college. According to the OECD, Canada's educational system is more effective than that of most other countries in compensating for income inequalities. But the reality is becoming quite different. As neighbourhoods become increasingly defined by income in the country's cities, student achievement scores reflect that divide.
In Toronto, where income inequality is highest, wealth and test scores at Canada's largest school board are correlated. A Globe and Mail analysis, based on data obtained from the Education Quality and Accountability Office and 2010 income data from Statistics Canada, shows this divergence quite clearly. High-scoring elementary schools are primarily concentrated in high-income areas and vice-versa. In lower-income neighbourhoods, a higher percentage of students fail the reading, writing and math tests.
When it comes to gifted students, nearly 60 per cent came from the three highest income deciles, according to a 2010 TDSB study. Fully a quarter came from the very highest income group, and only 11 per cent were from the three lowest deciles.
Kids from low-income families also have a higher likelihood of taking applied courses in high school, leaving them less likely to graduate or attend university or college.
"Kids are already coming into school at a disadvantage and that disadvantage appears to grow over time, rather than lessen," said Annie Kidder, executive director of the advocacy group People for Education.
Well-educated, high-income parents expect a lot from their schools and put pressure on teachers to perform. If those parents are absent, who is holding teachers accountable? Two years ago, Florida passed a bill to reward teachers for rising test scores, one of the key measures advocated by former governor Jeb Bush. Would merit pay for Canadian teachers help close the achievement gap? Progressive Conservative education critic Rob Leone said it's worth discussing. "All options have to be on the table because what we need to do is ensure that our kids are succeeding," he said.
The danger is that if left unchecked, income inequality in Toronto - and other Canadian cities - will lead to a greater concentration of high-scoring schools in well-to-do neighbourhoods. As housing prices continue to climb (since 2011, they've doubled), middle-class neighbourhoods with good schools become wealthy neighbourhoods and poorly performing schools are left behind.
Unlike cities such as Vancouver and Edmonton, where parents can choose which school to send students to, Toronto has rules surrounding geographic proximity. Students can only attend schools outside of their neighbourhood if there is room, and no schools with consistently high test scores have extra desks.
As a result, desirable schools drive surrounding real estate prices ever higher. Real-estate agent Patrick Rocca, who has worked in Toronto's Leaside and Davisville area for 20 years, said school catchment is "probably the No. 1 factor when people consider where they want to live."
There's a dangerous racial element to this divide. The majority of kids in families that earn more than $100,000 a year are white, while visible minorities, such as children from black, Middle Eastern and Latino families, tend to be disproportionately represented in the low-income group.
It's not supposed to be like this.
"Education is the part that holds the promise - that, if we're going to give everybody a fair start in life, the best place to do that is in school, where kids are. Schools provide a really important buffer to even out the chances for everyone," said Diane Dyson, director of research and public policy at WoodGreen Community Services, a social service agency. "To be rich is to know about possibilities. And so often poor kids don't know about possibilities."
On the ground, Naomi and Shazfa's educational experiences are both overtly and subtly different.
At Courcelette, more than 30 per cent of families make more than $100,000, according to the city. Almost all students meet the provincial standard on testing. At Edgewood, almost 40 per cent of families earn between $20,000 and $40,000. Only 20 per cent of Grade 6 students met the provincial standard in math in 2012-13. Edgewood also faces other challenges: A larger special-needs population and English-as-a-second-language learners.
When Courcelette's parents fundraise, they use the money to fulfill the principal's and teachers' "wish list," buying iPads and whiteboards for the classroom, for example, or funding arts and science programs that bring in community guests. Edgewood parents "fundraise for a purpose," said school council chair Lisa Clarke. Two years ago, Edgewood parents raised money to buy six folding tables for the gymnasium so that students would not have to sit on the floor to eat their lunch. One study found that when it comes to the amount of money collected through fundraising in Ontario, schools in the top 10 per cent raise a much as those in the bottom 81 per cent combined.
At Courcelette, where there is a significant number of stay-at-home parents, the school uses a lottery system for field trips because so many adults jostle for a spot. At Edgewood's first school council meeting in September, only two parents showed up. Precarious employment - defined as a state of employment that lacks security and benefits, is on the rise in Toronto according to a report last year - and can make it particularly difficult for lower-income families to be engaged in their schools and communities.
For Courcelette parents, providing enrichment for their kids comes so naturally that they barely notice they're doing it. "In terms of what I'm doing personally? Very little," Mr. Woods said, when asked about Naomi's extracurriculars.
The school board is aware of the achievement gap, and is making attempts to close it. One initiative provides additional funding to 150 TDSB schools, referred to as model schools, in low-income neighbourhoods for extra teaching supports, vision and hearing tests (with free glasses and hearing aids), nutrition programs and after-school activities.
One of Latifa Sultana's older children is a product of the model-school program, and participated in cricket and cycling. He applied and is now enrolled at a TDSB alternative school. Her eldest is in an International Baccalaureate program after receiving supports in school at an early age. Neither attends the local neighbourhood high school - secondary schools are not organized by catchment.
But raising test scores also takes strong leadership. At John A. Leslie Public School in Scarborough, where about 70 per cent of parents were born outside Canada, students are thriving despite the neighbourhood's low income. There are plenty of extracurriculars, including cricket, to keep kids engaged; parents come in for literacy nights and math nights; and a book lending program forces kids and their parents to read together at home. "Everything we know about effective school works at building on student engagement and parent engagement. We know that if parents feel welcome in their child's learning, then that carries over into the home," principal Greg McLeod said.
Income inequality isn't particular to Toronto, and other jurisdictions have taken steps to lessen its impact on education.
In the United States, the creation of school vouchers allows parents to choose which school their child attends, including private schools. In Vancouver, the opening of school boundaries means parents living in the east of the city often drive their kids to better schools in the west. But even though rules surrounding geographic proximity are not mandatory in Ontario, it's unlikely the province will abandon it.
Education Minister Liz Sandals said introducing school choice could exacerbate educational inequality, because low-income families don't necessarily have the means to drive their kid across town to a higher-ranking school.
Ms. Sandals said the solution lies in universal programs, such as full-day kindergarten, which has the potential to give every child, regardless of where they live, an early-learning experience. "You solve the problem through programming and not by opening by boundaries," she said. "Because quite frankly, we don't have any evidence that that actually changes things."
Carla Kisko, the TDSB's associate director of operations, agrees that opening up boundaries would be a nightmare when it comes to planning. "You [level the playing field] by focusing and looking at the data of students and really, truly putting intended additional support and effort to students that need the boost. That's happening every day," she said.
Principal Carol Cabral is new to Edgewood, and this year she started a home reading program and is working with staff to identify kids that need extra academic support. "We want the parents to be working with us. We want to give them the tools. We want to give them the strategies that we know will affect student achievement," she said. She is closely studying the EQAO results, and doing what she calls "intentional and strategic planning" to improve those scores. So when Shazfa takes the provincial test later this year, she is better prepared for the questions that come at her.
Is it enough to close the achievement gap? Long-time TDSB trustee Sheila Cary-Meagher has been heavily involved in the model-school initiative. "People like me like to think that we can. In our saner moments we know that we probably won't. But the minute you say 'You can't really expect to do that,' you lose the impetus, you lose the passion," she said.

Full text:   How faith communities are honouring the history of surplus sites - even after the sale. Here are two examples
One hundred years ago, the Soeurs de la Visitation purchased a pristine five-acre plot of land in what was to become Ottawa's fashionable Westboro neighbourhood, and erected a four-metre-high perimeter fence so that the cloistered sisters would be shielded from the world. Meanwhile, about a kilometre away, the finishing touches were put on the Westboro United Church, newly built to serve the congregation and the needs of the neighbouring community.
Although their missions were very different, by the end of the 20th century each organization had come to the same conclusion: Their shrinking memberships meant the time had come to sell their underused properties.
They're not alone. As faith congregations amalgamate because of dwindling attendance, hundreds of surplus religious properties are expected to hit the Canadian real estate market over the next decade. The United Church alone is looking at as many as 800 over the next 10 years, according to Chris Henderson, a renewable energy developer and congregation member who led the search for a buyer of the Westboro United property.
After Westboro United amalgamated with two other congregations to become Kitchissippi United Church, the organization sold the surplus Westboro site in 2011 to Springcress Properties Inc. The developer is constructing 19 townhomes on the property, and has transferred the church building to the Ottawa Music Foundation, organizer of the annual Ottawa Bluesfest, so that it can be redeveloped to a community arts purpose.
The sisters, meanwhile, decided to sell their property in 2010 to Ashcroft Homes, which is in the process of building residential condos on the site. Ashcroft will also redevelop the only structures to have been built on the property - an 1865 mansion and the sisters' 1913-built convent - as commercial space.
The lack of public consultation as to the fate of the sisters' property had the community in an uproar. There were strong objections to the additional density and increased traffic that the development will introduce to the neighbourhood. Community groups, including the Westboro Community Association, couldn't afford to challenge Ashcroft's plans at the Ontario Municipal Board level, so they eventually reached a compromise in 2011 that, among other things, had Ashcroft agree to cap the building heights at no more than nine storeys, and to donate $200,000 for community improvements.
But now there's an even larger Ottawa faith property on the market: The Oblate Fathers and the Sisters of the Sacred Heart are selling 30 largely undeveloped acres of prime land near Saint Paul University overlooking the Rideau River.
Mr. Henderson says some faith communities are torn between muddling along with their aging, expensive-to-maintain single-purpose built churches, or selling the properties to the highest bidder.
"What happens with many faith communities is they get tired, people get older, congregations shrink. They wring their hands, and at a certain point in time they go, 'Oh boy, we only have one option: sell it,' " Mr. Henderson says. "Then they make a decision they don't want to make."
It doesn't have to be an either-or proposition, says Mr. Henderson, who last month helped to organize a multi-faith symposium in Ottawa for discussing creative redevelopment ideas. Faith organizations are talking about how they can continue their missions in communities even after a sale - whether it's continuing to provide community support, arts and cultural programs or affordable housing.
"There can be hundreds of years of faith history on a site. Congregations can bear the loss of history and legacy if they are creating a new legacy that respects their missions," Mr. Henderson says.
Here, in detail, are the redevelopment approaches being pursued by the two former faith properties in Ottawa.
*****
Ravenhill Common
Former Westboro United Church, circa 1913
Address: 450 Churchill Ave. N.
Size: about one acre
Ottawa heritage designation: No
Developer: Springcress Properties Inc.
Purchase price: Not disclosed
Townhouse development cost: $12-million
Church building redevelopment cost: $2-million
Occupancy: Summer of 2014
In 2010, the Westboro United Church offered to give the property to any one of 30 non-profit community and social groups, provided they could build a new facility on the site and retain the original church building. The project cost proved too prohibitive, so the property was put out for bid. Local community and heritage groups were consulted before the church accepted the bid from Springcress Properties.
"We thought there was merit in keeping the 1913 structure, so we went to Bluesfest and committed to transferring the church building to them for $1," says Springcress president David Spillenaar. "They initially wanted to retrofit the church as a music hall, but the community was concerned about traffic and noise. So they agreed to create a loft space for their administration headquarters and develop the lower levels for community use."
Another key reason the congregation chose Springcress is because its plan to build 19 freehold townhomes is the right size for the local community, Mr. Henderson says. The buildings are low-rise and won't dwarf the former church, and they will have lower density than a condo tower, he says. The church is using 90 per cent of the proceeds from the sale to support community projects, while the remaining 10 per cent went to the local presbytery of the United Church to help meet the needs of new churches.
"The story here is about a different way of doing urban development... and doing it as a team with developers and the community," Mr. Henderson says.

Q West
Former Soeurs de la Visitation convent, circa 1865 and 1913
Address: 114 Richmond Rd.
Size: Five acres
Ottawa heritage designation: Yes
Developer: Ashcroft Homes
Total purchase price: $14.5-million
Convent building redevelopment: $4-million
Completion date: 2014
The sisters' former convent is comprised of two parts: a Gothic Revival house built around 1865 (and the only surviving mansion from that era along this section of Richmond Road), and additional wings arranged around a central courtyard that were completed after the sisters purchased the property in the early 20th century.
The complex is a rare surviving example of a property that housed a cloistered religious community for more than 100 years and functioned as a self-sustaining entity for much of that time, according to a statement of cultural heritage value prepared by +VG Architects.
Ashcroft Homes is building eight residential buildings (a total of 1,000 condo units, plus a seniors' residence), and will spend at least $4-million to transform the convent into commercial space for a restaurant, upscale grocery store and a 25-room boutique inn, says Ashcroft president David Choo.
Mr. Choo acknowledges the opposition to his condominium plan, and that many would have preferred the city or the province to have turned it into a public site. "But there were no funds to do that," he says.
His vision from the start, Mr. Choo says, "was to make the abbey the centrepiece, and to fuse its historical nature with the new condos in a totally mixed-use environment. You will see a celebration of the heritage that was there, as well as new uses."

Full text:   The village of Celebration has the Disney touch, an idealized way of life that harkens back to a simpler era
Wander into downtown Celebration with its cheery, pastel stucco buildings and postcard-pretty streets and you might think you've stumbled onto a movie set.
The assumption is understandable. The picturesque community, eight kilometres south of Walt Disney World, was built by Walt Disney Co. in the 1990s as the idealized town, modelled after early-1900s small U.S. burgs.
"Celebration was a unique opportunity that only Disney could pull off," notes Celebration town architect Mark Jones.
Celebration, an Orlando suburb launched in 1996 on former swamp land, was one of the first "new urbanism" communities in North America. Its walkable streets and compact town centre were an antidote to the sprawling, car-dependent developments of central Florida. Although the town centre was sold to a real estate management company in 2004, its Disneyesque charm is intact.
Today, it's home to about 9,000 residents and a popular draw for tourists who shop in the boutiques along Market and Front streets, come for a meal at its restaurants or enjoy an ice cream cone as they sit on benches overlooking the man-made lake. There's a busy year-round calendar of events, such as the annual Fourth of July fireworks display, Great American Pie Festival or holiday Tree Lighting Ceremony.
The downtown is an intriguing mix of buildings designed by famous architects. The tiny postmodern post office designed by Michael Graves is shaped like a silo, with playful porthole windows. Next door, slender columns cluster like Pick Up Sticks underneath a pyramid-shaped roof at the Philip Johnson-designed town hall. The whimsical Googie cinema (closed since 2010), with its twin spires, looks like architect Cesar Pelli took his inspiration from The Jetsons .
For a bird's eye view of Celebration, climb the stairs to the tower at the Bank of America. Parking is free on many of the streets, but some spots are designated for electric vehicles only.
Visitors who want to be removed from the bustle of nearby Disney World or Orlando could consider a stay at Celebration's Bohemian Hotel, a luxury boutique hotel that resembles a Caribbean-flavoured Eastern seaboard waterfront mansion. The casual chic lobby, in warm golden, cream and white tones, is a relaxing place to hang out or enjoy breakfast on the lakeside terrace, where you may catch a sighting of the lake's resident alligator. Wander its halls that act as mini-galleries and have a lookout for the taxidermy crocodile dangling on a wall.
On a warm September morning, the local Starbucks was bustling and the walking trails that connect Celebration's various neighbourhoods were in use by joggers, dog walkers and in-line skaters. By evening, the pub and restaurants (including Spanish/Cuban, diner fare, pasta and sushi) were doing a brisk business.
Jones, who has lived in Celebration for more than a decade, says he occasionally hears that the town is too perfect, too clean.
"It's just about the most normal place I've lived," he says. "It's ideal for raising kids and I can ride my bike to work."
Max LeMarchant of Cobourg, Ont., has visited Celebration more than a dozen times, on business and pleasure trips. "I love Celebration. It's one of those special places you have an affinity for. It's got a great sense of place and it's a village, rather than a subdivision or a resort."
While LeMarchant appreciates the mix of restaurants and the local pub, what he enjoys most is walking around the lake and exploring various Celebration neighbourhoods on foot.
Venture beyond Celebration's centre core for a nostalgic reminder of small towns past, when front porches were meant for socializing with the neighbours. Celebration's residential areas are characterized by tree-lined streets, parks and charming homes that range from modest to luxurious. Garages for the most part are at the rear and porches proliferate. Homes feature classical, coastal, colonial revival, French, Mediterranean, and Victorian style; while the architecture is appealing, street widths, scale and proportion of buildings have also been considered. With the lawns and gardens so tidy, Jones says he is frequently asked whether Disney takes care of homeowners' yards. It doesn't.
Even the Celebration Golf Club boasts a meticulous attention to design. Father-son duo Robert Trent Jones Sr. and Robert Trent Jones Jr. created the course that resembles a natural park with gently undulating terrain that winds through a series of small lakes and stands of oak, pine and magnolia trees.
Signs remind visitors that it is a violation to feed or harass the alligators found in the lakes and waterways of Celebration. An urban myth claims that Celebration's fish, turtles and alligators are audio-animatronic critters created by Disney. But be assured: The wildlife, and Celebration's human inhabitants, are the real thing.

ORLANDO'S NEW SPIRIT
Several modern-day speakeasies - retro bars that pay homage to the Prohibition era - have sprung up in Orlando over the past 12 months.
The Courtesy (114 N. Orange Ave., 407-450-2041) is a beautiful old-fashioned bar serving decadent cocktails that wouldn't be out of place in an F. Scott Fitzgerald novel.
The Woods (49 N. Orange Ave., 407-203-1114) also crafts amazing vintage-inspired cocktails and has impressive bar snacks, such as hand-seasoned nuts. Don't miss Bacon Wednesdays, where drinks come with a strip of pepper-crusted bacon.
Pharmacy (8060 Via Dellagio Way, 407-985-2972) is entered via an antique elevator. You ring a brass doorbell if you want to be let in to sample one of their fancy "elixirs," as they call their cocktails.
Hanson's Shoe Repair (27 E. Pine St., 407-476-9446) takes the speakeasy theme a step further, with a secret entrance and a required daily password for which you need to call in advance. Once inside, you'll find a cozy bar with brickwork and vintage wood, with early jazz or soul music playing softly in the background.

Full text:   It's increasingly looking like the strength that Canada's housing market has been showing in recent months has staying power.
Economists have been surprised by the degree to which home sales have bounced back from the pounding they took in the summer of 2012, when Finance Minister Jim Flaherty tightened the mortgage insurance rules.
Part of the reason the market has been so resilient since July is that consumers have been jumping in because they feared that mortgage rates would be rising. Many economists have been forecasting a drop in sales once that phenomenon plays out. Most experts say it won't be until the end of the year that we'll really know whether the recent momentum is more than a short-term blip.
The latest data, for October, will be released Friday by the Canadian Real Estate Association. The preliminary numbers from local real estate boards suggest it was another strong month, on the heels of September's 18.2-per-cent year-over-year increase in sales.
"Canada's real estate market looks like it has its mojo back," Bank of Montreal economist Benjamin Reitzes said in a research note. "Existing home sales are expected to rise 12 per cent year-over-year in October, continuing the firming momentum established in the summer months.
"The persistent strength suggests that it's more than just sales brought forward due to anticipation of higher rates," he added. "In fact, mortgage rates have shifted lower in recent weeks, reinforcing that rates aren't likely to move materially higher any time soon."
It should be noted that the market was in a slump this time last year, making it easier for the year-over-year comparisons to be strong. But this spring economists were expecting home sales in 2013 to come in below 2012, and that's no longer the case.
And new home construction continues to be stronger than expected, suggesting builders think the market still has legs, although economists continue to caution that the pace of building should come down.
Economists were expecting builders to start construction on 190,000 new homes on an annualized basis last month, but the actual number came in at 198,000.
But some say that may not last.
"This renewed strength in the housing market is not expected to continue for much longer, as many of the largest markets in Canada are overbuilt," Toronto-Dominion Bank research associate Sonny Scarfone wrote in a note. "Demographically supported levels of new home construction are an estimated 175,000 units."

Full text:   The Throops trade a lavish Mississauga lifestyle for downtown luxury; Ira Jelinek puts his move on hold
In downtown Toronto, Mike and Mary Throop stand in front of floor-to-ceiling windows on the 20th floor of the Shangri-La. The city view from their living room extends up University Avenue and over to the landmark clock tower at Old City Hall.
To illustrate the transformation in their lives, they've set the large-screen TV to display photos of the lifestyle they left behind in Mississauga, where their Lorne Park house offered lavish space inside, a curvaceous swimming pool with a waterfall outside, and a quick drive to the golf club.
The Throops still recall the reaction of many in their social circle when they announced they would be moving to 180 University Ave., more formally known as Private Estates - Living above the Shangri-La Hotel Toronto.
"On the golf course, they basically told him he's crazy," says Ms. Throop, as her husband agrees.
The builders of Toronto's condominium towers are counting on wooing buyers like the Throops - the well-off empty-nesters who no longer want to be shackled by the responsibility of owning a sprawling property in the burbs.
They are also aiming projects at a younger segment of condo buyers who want to live downtown or on a transit line. They may have help from parents or grandparents in making a down payment - then they pay the mortgage as previous generations paid rent. Many will forgo a car to be within walking distance of vibrant nightlife.
Then there are the investors - foreign and local - who are buying the ever-smaller units still in the planning phase.
Builders are also competing with resale condos that are on the market.
Buyers haven't disappeared but, in every segment, they have more pull than they've had in years. Builders, real estate agents and sellers have to be more enterprising and energetic.
In the first three quarters of 2013, sales of new condo units dropped 27.4 per cent from the same period in 2012, according to numbers from RealNet Canada Inc. Inventory stands approximately 13 per cent above the level at this time last year.
Ira Jelinek is a real estate agent with Harvey Kalles Real Estate Ltd. who recently sold his own condo unit in mid-town Toronto and plans to rent for a while. He says personal circumstances are partly dictating that choice - he's engaged to be married and plans to buy a new place with his fiancee - but he also thinks there is no reason to rush into buying right now.
Mr. Jelinek sees the same hesitation among other potential buyers. "Look at the choice I'm making: It costs me less to rent than to own," Even with a 20-per-cent down payment, he figures it will cost him 20 per cent less to rent than to buy.
He can't say where the market will be a year from now but that discount for renting makes sense either way. "If it goes up 5 per cent or down 5 per cent, I still think I'm better off renting."
The buyer of Mr. Jelinek's unit also consulted with the agent about buying a second condo in the preconstruction phase as an investment. But he says the math didn't work. The buyer paid about $530 a square foot for Mr. Jelinek's condo suite. The unit in a new project planned for Yonge and Eglinton was going to be in the range of $700 to $750 a square foot. The buyer signed a deal, then backed out during the 10-day cooling-off period.
"He could just see that I didn't have a great feeling about it," Mr. Jelinek says. "Now I think builders have really cranked up the price compared with three to five years ago."
A few years ago, he says, "people were buying regardless. There was a frenzy."
Out-of-town investors have also slowed in their buying, he adds. As a result, builders are offering more incentives. Some, for example, will arrange help with financing so that the buyer needs to put just 5 per cent down. Assignment clauses, which allow the purchaser to sell to someone else before the building is fully built and registered, have also become less restrictive. Free lockers are sometimes thrown in.
"Anything to get a sale down," Mr. Jelinek says.
The agent says he's selling fewer condos this year than last, but single-family houses are still going strong.
Christopher Bibby, an agent with Sutton Group Associates, says the market continues to be choppy and unpredictable.
He recently sold a condo unit in the Scrivener Square development at Yonge and Summerhill. He had 22 showings in the first day-and-a-half, he says, and the unit sold within two days. Another agent just sold a suite for $100,000 over asking during the agents' open house.
But other listings have been sitting much longer. Deals take longer to complete as buyers and sellers haggle. "Everyone's stubborn," he says. "The buyers are a lot more diligent."
As a Bay Street money manager, Ms. Throop has built her career on her ability to evaluate a sound investment. She is not fazed by fears of a condo bubble in Toronto.
"To me, in real estate it's all about location," she says. "Then, I wanted to make sure we got value for money."
The upper end of the market is still a fairly narrow tranche that hasn't seen the proliferation of building that has taken place at the lower end, she adds.
Ms. Throop pored over plans and looked at all of the luxury towers, including the Four Seasons Private Residences and the Residences at the Ritz-Carlton. The couple favoured the Shangri-La for its location near Bay Street and quick access to the Gardiner Expressway. They wanted three bedrooms so that their sons have their own space when they're back from university for a visit. Ms. Throop wanted an outdoor balcony.
And there were personal reasons: She's always enjoyed staying at the five-star hotel when her job takes her to Asia. "I'm familiar with the Shangri-La brand because I travel a lot."
When the market entered a lull in the summer of 2010, the Throops were able to negotiate a good deal in the preconstruction phase. Now, Ms. Throop says, many of her friends are also trading spacious houses for luxurious condos. "Quite a few have followed us into this building."
The Throops have no regrets about their decision. They don't miss the 5,500 square feet they had in their house because the condo's layout is well-planned and the combined living room, dining room and kitchen is accommodating.
"This is a big room," she says. "It's basically where we're living."
She is enjoying the building's perks, security and hotel amenities.
She's also not worried about any fluctuations in the market. "To me, real estate is a 10-year-plus investment."

Full text:   Architects Titka Safarzadeh and Saied Mahboubi looked up to find a dramatic solution for a narrow lot in East York
jmays@globeandmail.com
When they laid out the heart of Toronto's East York neighbourhood during the interwar years of the previous century, developers wooed prospective homeowners with inexpensive bungalows set on narrow, long lots. This patterning of the urban grid had consequences for the way the city looks and works.
One is the attractively distinctive East York streetscape. It's typically a tight, low-rise rhythm of very modest house-fronts that hails from the early days of Hogtown's suburbanization and stands as a reminder of the city's working-class roots.
Another result is a local real estate market in which prices lagged behind other parts of Toronto. It's not hard to figure out the reasons. The original housing stock, which was cheap to begin with, has now grown elderly, and most of the one-storey homes are too small for contemporary people. In many cases, a teardown makes sense. But we come back to the very skinny configuration of the properties. Can a new, well-lit and ample detached house be shoe-horned into a site that is deep, but just around 6.1 metres wide?
Last week, I saw an effective answer to this question on a typical East York street.
The two-level, 1,600-square-foot residence I visited started out as a speculative development by Toronto architects Titka Safarzadeh and Saied Mahboubi. But as often happens when interesting modern homes go up in rapidly gentrifying districts, the building was sold while still under construction.
Because Linear House (as the project is called) was not designed for a specific client, however, it lends itself to a reading as a kind of case study about housing on tight lots. It's an experiment, that is, in building compactly and well in a part of the city where urban geography makes doing so a challenge. And it's an experiment that works.
An important part of this challenge involves light - scooping up enough of it, distributing it evenly throughout the interior, making sure the centre of the house is properly illuminated. Ms. Safarzadeh and Mr. Mahboubi have dealt with the problem of brightening the house's middle portion by turning the central stair into a glass-framed light well topped by a large skylight.
This tower of glass, with the stairwell suspended in it, is the primary architectural focus of the building. It's the first thing the visitor sees upon stepping into the structure through the main entrance, which has been pulled smartly around to the side to emphasize the middle-oriented character of the design. In addition, wide horizontal openings and a two-storey vertical window on the stucco and dark brick front façade also serve to banish darkness from the interior of this building.
Along with getting enough light inside, ensuring spatial breadth is another concern for anyone who crafts a narrow detached home. Ms. Safarzadeh and Mr. Mahboubi have addressed both issues in engaging ways, but their treatment of spatial flow is especially noteworthy.
Take the living room, for example. Starting at the large streetside windows, strong lines lead the eye smoothly back to the central glass-enclosed stairwell, as well as upward, through the double-height opening, to the skylight overhead. This area of the house is only about 4.3 metres wide, but the sense of it is expansive because nothing blocks the long views that its walls create.
At the same time, the interior retains a sculpted look, and does not dissolve into so much undifferentiated volume. The living-room seating ensemble, for instance, is gathered into a clearly defined territory that is crisply separated from the kitchen and dining area by a short flight of steps. The food-preparation island in the kitchen establishes a long sightline between a vertical opening and the tall windows leading out to the deck and the large back garden beyond, but the kitchen/dining area still has about it a feel that is distinctly more intimate than the light-filled, dramatic living room.
Thus, Ms. Safarzadeh and Mr. Mahboubi have maintained certain desirable continuities with yesteryear's standard Toronto detached house - by making spaces that express their functions, and don't puddle out into patches of noplace or anyplace, for example - while instilling their project with flair that is very contemporary.
The narrow lots of East York can surely tax the architectural imagination. But occasionally the stress prompts residential designers to come up with exciting and agreeable solutions to the problem. Linear House is one of them.

Full text:   Concerns raised about government proposal to change responsibilities of Agricultural Land Commission
A government proposal that would redraft the way farmland is protected in the province has raised concerns about the autonomy of British Columbia's Agricultural Land Commission.
For 40 years, the ALC has been managing 4.7 million hectares of agricultural land at an arm's length from government. But a cabinet document obtained by The Globe and Mail shows Agriculture Minister Pat Pimm is proposing to move the ALC into his ministry while reassigning some of its powers to the BC Oil and Gas Commission and to local governments.
"Well, that virtually takes the ALC out of the equation," Richard Bullock, chair of the ALC said on Thursday. "I'm not sure where this is coming from or why."
Mr. Bullock said his biggest concern is that local governments would be assigned powers over the use of agricultural land. Asked if he thought that would lead to the erosion of the Agricultural Land Reserve, particularly along the edges of rapidly growing communities, he laughed and said: "Well, I guess you draw your own conclusions on that one."
Kevin Boon, general manager of the B.C. Cattlemen's Association, agreed giving the B.C. Oil and Gas Commission more authority is worrying.
"That's probably the biggest concern because a little over 50 per cent of the ALR is in the north, in the Peace region," he said. "That's not to say that we don't think there's some changes that could and do need to be made, it's just that they need to be made for the right purpose and the major priority has to be protecting agricultural land."
Mr. Boon said any change to B.C.'s ALR "has to be done very, very carefully and I worry if their plan is to take out an independent commission that's kind of a watchdog."
Adrian Dix, leader of the NDP, said the government needs to be open and transparent in its plans for the ALC, especially because Premier Christy Clark did not campaign on revamping the agency. "The Premier and her colleagues in the election campaign didn't say anything about this," he said. "If they are going to make a major change like that ... tell the public about it and allow for a public debate."
Mr. Dix said the ALC was created by an NDP government 40 years ago, but over the years its role has been reaffirmed by a succession of different administrations.
The news horrified two members of Metro Vancouver's regional planning committee, which was planning to vote Friday on a motion urging the province to protect the ALC and to give it enough money to function properly.
"Turning it over to the oil and gas industry is worse than gutting it entirely," said Harold Steves, a Richmond councillor who is the vice-chair of the committee.
Mr. Steves said Metro is prepared to use whatever powers it has to prevent any farmland from being converted, no matter what happens to the commission.
Andrea Reimer, a Vancouver councillor who is also on the Metro Vancouver planning committee, said the news about the proposed legislation is "exactly what I feared."
She called the potential changes "wholly inappropriate."
Those views were in dramatic contrast to those of people in the commercial real-estate sector, who have been making the case for several years in the Lower Mainland that some of the farmland near the rapidly expanding Deltaport could be better used for distribution centres and other port-serving activities.
The commission is "possibly controlling land that has a higher and better use for a productive economy" in B.C., said Chris MacCauley, a vice-president at CBRE, a global commercial real-estate services firm. "I think we do need to find a balance. As a province we need to look at our key economic drivers. And the port is the third largest employer in the province."
Energy Minister Bill Bennett, who is in charge of the government's core review, said the ALC is being looked at, but he promised B.C.'s farmland would be protected. "There is nothing that we would contemplate that would reduce or undermine the central principle of the Agricultural Land Reserve, which is the protection of farm land and the sustainability of farming," he said.

AGRICULTURAL LAND RESERVE
This is a partial transcript of a document on government letterhead, portions of which were blacked out, that carries the signature line for B.C. Agriculture Minister Pat Pimm. It identifies the Agricultural Land Reserve as the issue to be addressed through proposed policy changes.
Cabinet Decision Summary Sheet
Issue: Agricultural Land Reserve
The Agricultural Land Commission legislative mandate is too narrow to allow decisions that align with the priority for economic development.
Request:
Modernize the ALC to ensure that government's priorities for economic development are reflected in ALC decisions, and to improve service levels for applicants.
Proposed Minute:
* Develop the necessary policy, regulatory and legislative amendments to:
* Modernize ALC decision making to reflect government priorities.
* Create two ALR areas with different rules.
* Change the ALC's legislative mandate, in one or both ALR areas
* Remove some decisions from the ALC.
* Community growth applications decided by local governments.
* Modernize ALC operations by moving the ALC into the Ministry.
Honorable Pat Pimm
A second document was not on government letterhead. It contained additional information and sources say it appears to be an accurate summary of the government's proposals.
Cabinet is days away from considering the Core Review's proposal on the Agricultural Land Reserve and Agricultural Land Commission.
The proposed changes, if approved, will:
1) Dismantle the Agricultural Land Commission - staff and their functions will move into the Ministry of Agriculture. There will be regional panels but decisions will be able to be appealed to a third party and overturned.
2) Change the mandate of the ALC - the ALC will be required to give equal weight to economic development as well as agriculture.
3) Create two classes of ALR - one area will be status quo - this will be the Okanagan and Fraser Valley-Vancouver Island. The other area will cover the Interior, Kootenays and everything north of the Okanagan, where the rules will be "anything goes."
4) Change what local governments can and can't do around land use decisions.
5) Make oil and gas decisions the priority land use decisions and the Oil and Gas Commission the primary authority.

At Minto30Roe, the condominium developer is selling buyers on the conveniences of living in high-rise suites, but model suite names like Bayview, Eglinton, Briar Hill and Lytton are a subtle reminder of the luxuries to be found on the surrounding streets.
"We're tucked into the residential neighbourhood on 30 Roehampton [Ave.], so with that, it gives you the sense of being part of a community," says director of marketing Natascha Pieper. "So if you want to take your dog for a walk, it's peaceful with parks and ... a lot of beautiful homes."
Established shops, restaurants and theatres on Eglinton Avenue and Yonge Street, as well as the subway, schools and supermarkets are also merely steps from the 34-storey tower to completed by spring 2015.
"There is a lot of competition at Yonge and Eglinton, so the market is becoming a bit saturated with new developments, but we're above the competition in the sense that we've started construction, so you can move in sooner rather than later." Ms. Pieper adds.
Expanding on local attractions, the 397-unit tower will bear hotel-inspired amenities, such as a 6,000-square-foot fitness centre providing personal trainers, à la carte programs and nutrition classes.
For social affairs, there will be a party room, kitchen and rooftop terrace to lounge, dine and barbecue. "There is a cascading water feature surrounded by a nice seating area, so you could sit out in the evenings and entertain your friends, it's like an outdoor oasis," Ms. Pieper notes.
Residents can continue the party upstairs in one to two-bedroom plus den units with open principal rooms and private balconies. "It's very important our residents have their own sense of outdoor space, so our balconies are very large," states Ms. Pieper. "They're over 120 square feet."
Nine-foot ceilings will appear in nearly each suite, which II by IV Design Associates styled with laminate floors, European-inspired cabinetry and Caesarstone counters as seen in the 828-square-foot model suite.
Ms. Pieper pegs monthly fees at 54 cents per square feet. Parking will be $46,000 and lockers $4,500.

The housing numbers don't measure up

Full text:   What if your economy was at a critical juncture, but a vital part of the economic picture was obscured in a fog of inadequate data?
I'm not talking about the lack of October employment numbers from the shut-down U.S. government, which clouded the Federal Reserve's view of the all-important labour market. Thankfully, our American neighbours have put their government back to work, and the data from the Bureau of Labour Statistics are flowing once again to the Fed's monetary policy makers.
I refer instead to a longer-lasting and potentially even more problematic quandary for Canadian policy makers. At a time when the country's biggest economic priority is to delicately stickhandle around a swath of overindebted households and a still-volatile and unpredictable housing market, we're doing so with the aid of opaque and incomplete housing data.
Most key economic statistics in this country are overseen by Statistics Canada, one of the most respected official statistical agencies in the world. Not so for many crucial housing numbers. The monthly count of housing starts comes from Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp., the federal government agency that oversees mortgage insurance and mortgage-backed securities. For home sales and prices, we rely on the Canadian Real Estate Association, the national umbrella group of real estate agents and brokers; it compiles its data from a network of local real estate boards. Statscan handles the monthly building-permits numbers.
The fragmentation of data sources goes beyond the obvious questions about consistency. With the collection of housing indicators coming under increased scrutiny, the concerns have been getting more specific.
Recently, former Member of Parliament and popular blogger Garth Turner questioned whether CREA's system is giving us a distorted count on home sales, due to a tactic among some agents to list properties with several local real estate boards to attract more potential buyers. CREA has also been criticized for delaying incorporating monthly revisions from local boards (for example, to capture apparent sales that fell through) into its national data.
While CREA insists that neither is a problem, the issue has certainly raised the question of whether we are overestimating the true strength of the housing market. The question takes on more urgency when we see sales numbers like we did this week from the boards in Vancouver (up 38 per cent in October from a year earlier), Toronto (up 19 per cent) and Calgary (up 18 per cent).
Of even bigger concern are the numbers on investment activity in the housing market, particularly among foreigners. They don't exist. Last week, some of the country's top economists raised this issue with federal Finance Minister Jim Flaherty, who has acknowledged that he has no hard data on how much of Canada's housing boom has been fuelled by investors who are looking to make money as property owners rather than acquire personal residences.
The distinction matters a great deal. A substantial downturn in the housing market - say, one triggered by government policy - would trigger a much bigger exodus of investors than permanent residents, and so the risks to the Canadian economy rise with the proportion of investor money pumping up the market. And yet Mr. Flaherty has been crafting policy aimed at cooling the market without that information. The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions has been talking since mid-2011 about uncovering the amount of foreign investment in Canada's real estate market - and yet we still have no visibility.
Cleaning up this muddle of inadequate housing data must be made top priority for Canada's financial and statistical institutions. We can't keep flying blind.

Canadian house sales continued to be strong in October, and economists are watching to see if the strength persists through to the new year.
While national data from the Canadian Real Estate Association will not be available until mid-month, local real estate boards have been disclosing their October data and most are showing double-digit, year-over-year gains.
Sales were up 19.2 per cent in the Toronto area last month, 37.8 per cent in Vancouver, 18 per cent in Calgary, 37.27 per cent in Victoria, 15.6 per cent in Edmonton, and two per cent in Ottawa.
"Ho hum, another double-digit gain for Canadian home sales in October," Bank of Montreal chief economist Douglas Porter wrote in a research note.
"Sales may not quite match the knockout 18 per cent year-over-year national gain seen in September, but the comparison is a bit more challenging this month," he wrote. "Bottom line is that Canadian home sales remain quite resilient, and have put the weakness in late 2012 and early 2013 far into the rear-view mirror."
Dianne Usher, president of the Toronto Real Estate Board, said in a press release that the city's "home ownership market has been broadly characterized by a rebound in sales since the summer."
There were 8,000 sales via Toronto's Multiple Listing Service last month, up from 6,713 in the same month of 2012.
The city's average selling price was $539,058, up by more than 7 per cent from $502,127 a year earlier.
Detached houses in the downtown 416 telephone area code saw their average selling price rise by 12.4 per cent, to $873,509. The average selling price of existing condos in the 416 area rose 7.2 per cent to $384,441. Price growth in the suburban 905 area code was softer.
The Greater Toronto MLS Home Price Index, which seeks to account for fluctuations in the type or size of houses that are selling, was up by 4.5 per cent.
Mr. Porter said that while sales are strong, "it's a much more restrained picture on the price side ... which may help explain why the merchandise is moving.
"Half the cities reporting so far for October have recorded slight price dips, while gains in other cities are modest," he said.
Economists have been noting that price movements usually lag changes in sales. Sales plunged in the summer of 2012 and remained soft through to last spring.

Full text:   Students are increasingly looking to add community involvement to their studies
During a study tour of Japan last spring, McGill University MBA student Ba Sein and his classmates made the usual rounds of corporate boardrooms, factories and lecture halls. Then they went off the traditional business school grid - to perform volunteer work at the Second Harvest food bank in Tokyo.
"It was such a stark contrast from the image of glitz and glamour of Tokyo and a wealthy industrialized Japanwe had been exposed to until that point," Mr. Sein says.
The experience made a profound impression on Mr. Sein. He was "somewhat shocked" to learn that one in six people in Japan lives in poverty, he says, but was inspired by the business model developed by the national food bank to reduce food waste, collect surplus supplies and deliver them to those in need.
"For business students, tackling a societal challenge through sound business practices, community involvement and volunteerism is very interesting and an excellent learning opportunity," says Mr. Sein, who hopes to contribute to the social and economic development of his native Myanmar after he graduates next May.
The primary purpose of the mandatory international study tour is to acquaint MBA students at McGill's Desautels Faculty of Management with business practices in other parts of the world. The faculty recently added "a social mission component" to the annual expedition, at the request of students - a reflection of the growing interest in social enterprise at Canadian business schools.
At McGill and elsewhere, students interested in more than the profit motive are taking courses on social entrepreneurship, internships at non-profits and volunteer activities such as the Second Harvest event.
In British Columbia, for instance, University of Victoria commerce grads Rebecca Koch and Kim Cope received help from the Innovation Centre for Entrepreneurs, a startup incubator at the Peter B. Gustavson School of Business, to form a "community contribution company."
Through an initiative called early entrepreneurs, they teach young children how to raise money for social causes. Building on a concept piloted by real estate entrepreneur Taylor Conroy, Ms. Koch and Ms. Cope go into elementary schools, offering $100 in seed money and guiding kids through the development of business ventures aimed at bringing in at least $500. Proceeds go to the Free the Children charity. The first 18 classrooms to participate raised $18,000 - enough for Free the Children to build two schools in Kenya, Ms. Koch says.
Ms. Koch and Ms. Cope hope to expand their operation. "Both Kim and I have worked in different office jobs ... and we both wanted to try something new, something that has the intrinsic rewards that a social venture has," Ms. Koch says.
York University's Schulich School of Business in Toronto has long been a magnet for students interested in human rights, health care, environmental protection, education, culture and other not-for-profit fields. Schulich bills its social sector management program as one of the few MBA degrees in the world "with a specialization in the social sector and the management of social-sector organizations."
Business professor Cameron Graham, acting director of the program, says there is a growing need for graduates with such expertise as non-profits look for more sustainable methods of financing, beyond charitable donations and hard-to-obtain government funding.
"There has to be a lot of creativity brought to bear on the problem of how do you do something that's worthwhile, yet attract sustainable funding for it," Prof. Graham says.
At the University of Victoria, all commerce students are introduced to the concept of social entrepreneurship by their third year of undergraduate studies, says Matt Murphy, a professor who has developed a new fourth-year course on social entrepreneurship. The course includes readings on the emergence of "social intrapreneurs," people who act as socially responsible change agents within corporations. "I try to emphasize in this course that social entrepreneurship doesn't belong to any one sector, and it's not just something that is done in startups. It can happen anywhere," Prof. Murphy says.
In Montreal, a collaboration between McGill's business faculty and two management consulting firms - McKinsey and Co. and Oliver Wyman - has been critical to the success of McGill's not-for-profit consulting program, which received 90 student applications for 12 spots this fall, says business professor Omar Toulan, a co-founder of the program.
Three teams of four students - a combination of undergrads and MBA students - have access to the consultants' expertise as they work with local non-profit organizations on proposals to improve some aspect of their operations, while the professors provide academic oversight.
"We encourage them to focus on issues where they can bring some knowledge that the NGO [non-governmental organization] doesn't have - so a management issue, an expansion issue, a costing issue. We want them to go through the process of finding the client, developing a project, performing the project, presenting it - really the full cycle of consulting - while, at the same time learning what it's like to help an NGO," Prof. Toulan says.
"It is very different to consult for an NGO which, let's say, is ideologically driven."
Recently a team of McGill students worked with a meal program in Montreal to develop a sideline business - selling frozen meals to students - and using the profits to support the core objective of providing fresh food to clients who could not provide for themselves.
"The students did the whole scenario and, yes, did trials of freezing food and everything," Prof. Toulan says. Their recommendations were implemented this fall.

From afar, Montreal can often seem like a society on the verge of either falling apart or tearing itself into two. Of late, there's been the stream of revelations surrounding municipal corruption and the debate over the Parti Quebecois's proposed charter of values - punctuated by good ol' fashioned skirmishes over language politics.
Whenever you're actually in the city, however, it can be hard to find the divisions that make the headlines.
Certainly at a Sunday matinee of The St. Leonard Chronicles at the English-language Centaur Theatre in Old Montreal, there's every stripe of local - linguistically, as well as ethnically - packing the house. And they're all laughing ensemble at a play about a young Italian-Canadian couple whose Sunday family dinner turns into a disaster when they tell their parents they're selling the house and moving away from the old neighbourhood to a suburb on the West Island.
"What I love in my audiences is that I feel that there is what we call in Quebec the new nation, la nouvelle nation ," says Steve Galluccio, the comedy's trilingual playwright who is busy translating his latest for a French run at a yet-to-be-named theatre company next season. "You don't feel the acrimony - it's not here, it's sort of made up by the media."
Nevertheless, it's clear from the roaring of the crowd that Montrealers wanted a laugh right now. Indeed, The St. Leonard Chronicles was extended before it even opened in September - and sold out its initial run in Centaur's 440-seat main theatre by its first weekend. (It now runs to Dec. 1.)
Galluccio's name is all it took to get box-office phones ringing - which makes him almost an anomaly among North American playwrights today. His previous comedies Mambo Italiano (which was translated into French by Michel Tremblay and was also made into a movie) and the lower-profile In Piazza San Domenico obviously left local audiences happy.
The St. Leonard Chronicles is definitely full of crowd-pleasing, hyperlocal jokes - mostly about Montreal's Italian communities, which encompass Galluccio's biggest fans. There are gags about awful homemade wine, family vacations to Wildwood on the Jersey Shore, and rivalries between neighbourhoods such as Little Italy and Ville émard (which here gets insulted via a French scatological pun as "Ville à Marde").
It's not rave reviews that are bringing in the crowds, anyway. There's an over-the-top nature to Galluccio's characters - not so much operatic, as soap operatic - and a TV-sitcom quality to his dialogue that has never won over critics. The Centaur productions of his plays - this is the third I've seen - also always leave something to be desired in terms of acting and direction. (Though Christina Broccolini, who plays the young suburb-craving Terry, is a star.)
But Galluccio's not writing for critics - indeed, the 53-year-old, who also works as a screenwriter and writer for sitcoms in both French and English, paints himself as free from pretension and politics that plague other playwrights. "I find myself going to the theatre and I watch plays that I don't really understand," he says. "There's some important message in it - sometimes I feel like I'm being talked down to. My characters are very simple, they're everyday people."
If you dig beneath its surface, however, Galluccio's latest play is hardly that disconnected from theatrical trends. It may have a sentimental ending to balance out the profane put-downs, but The St. Leonard Chronicles is only the latest in a long line of shows where secrets come out as the alcohol goes in - that's a tradition from Edward Albee's Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf? to Tracy Letts's August: Osage County .
The St. Leonard Chronicles also grapples with what has been the major theme of this country's drama since its birth - how first-generation Canadian values clash with those of their children (and, in this case, grandchildren). The tension between assimilation and cultural preservation has been the subject of comedy-inflected dramas from David French's Leaving Home (1972) to Ins Choi's more recent hit Kim's Convenience (2011).
Galluccio's comedy begins with Dora, the foul-mouthed grandmother played by Jocelyne Zucco, telling a story about the racist taunts she endured from both English and French speakers while she tried to drag a trunk up one of Montreal's famous outdoor staircases upon immigrating to the city after the Second World War.
The next generation knows its way around icy stairs, but has its own problems of perception to deal with. "Now they think we're all in the Mafia," says Dora's son-in-law Dante - played by another Italian-Montrealer playwright, Vittorio Rossi - a line that resonates in light of the news constantly pouring out of the Charbonneau Commission.
As for the third generation, Terry and Robert are more preoccupied with another national obsession - real estate - and just want to blend in out in the 'burbs.
The debate that ensues over the couple's proposed move at a private dinner table is really a variant on the one that's going on publicly over the proposed charter of values. Perhaps the funniest scene in The St. Leonard Chronicles comes when Terry's father Carmine (Michel Perron) asks her whether the newest wave of immigrants into St. Leonard is what's behind what is, to him, otherwise an inexplicable move. "Are you running away from the Arabs?" he asks. When Terry accuses her father of being racist, Robert's mother Elisa (Ellen David) chimes in: "You're the ones running away from the Arabs, not us!"
The St. Leonard Chronicles may be a comedy, but it's not in any way escapist. Indeed, it's hard to think of a play on a Canadian stage right now that's more au courant .

Full text:   Sustainable.TO snatches another design win, this time with a back-to-basics design that is habitable even after a hurricane
daveleblanc@globeandmail.com
First of all, I'd like to assure you, gentle reader, that architect Paul Dowsett of local firm Sustainable.TO does not have any incriminating photos of The Architourist. Yet. Regular shout-outs in this space are the result of the accolades and awards the firm keeps on winning.
Back in June, it was as finalist for "PHASEhouse," an ultra-inexpensive home that can be built for flood susceptible regions of Cambodia, designed for Building Trust International. Two years ago, "Low Cost/Low Energy House" took first place for a shotgun-style home for New Orleans' hurricane-ravaged Lower Ninth Ward (this one hosted by DesignbyMany.com and Archdaily.com).
This time, Sustainable has upped the ante, celebrity-style.
Last weekend, principal Mr. Dowsett, designer Nicholas Discenza and building scientist Andrew Stiffman toured a site struck by Hurricane Sandy in the Far Rockaway neighbourhood of Queens, New York, with Chelsea Clinton. Here, you see, "Resilient House," Sustainable's winning entry into the New York category of the Designing Recovery competition - hosted by the American Institute of Architects and Brad Pitt's Make It Right foundation, among others - is going to be built for the Lyons family. Interestingly, while New York's GOATstudio won for their New Orleans flood-proof home, the winner for a tornado-proof home for Joplin, Mo., was created by another Toronto firm, Q4 Architects.
Resilient House is a tidy, raised-on-stilts, shotgun-style home with an interesting Modernist roofline, but what really sets the design apart is just how low-tech it is.
"A lot of times, when a hurricane hits, utilities will be down for days, weeks," explains Sustainable's Craig Race, "and because this house has such a low energy demand to begin with, people can continue to live in it ... because the sun and the wind keep the house comfortable."
Adds Mr. Dowsett: "The houses that were livable in New Orleans after [hurricane] Katrina were the houses that were designed and built pre-electricity: they dried out quite nicely [and] they didn't grow mould." Newer houses - the ones that rely on mechanical ventilation - were bulldozed, he laments. "So we figured going back to natural ventilation is the way," he laughs, "... back to the future."
And the future will no doubt be a bright one in this home: On the main floor, clerestory windows tucked into the playful roofline will rain light down into the middle. Two sets of sliding doors in the living and dining areas lead occupants to a large deck outside, while a bank of eight windows on the two-storey portion of the home also provide natural day lighting and passive heating (with a partial second storey, this home is known as a "camelback shotgun"); since all apertures face the sun, "light shelves" above each have been calculated to limit summertime penetration.
At 935 square feet, the main floor is large enough to feature a 10-by-13-foot master bedroom. Upstairs, contained within 586 square feet, the two children's bedrooms aren't much smaller (the Lyons have four children). Windows into the corridor and stairwell ensure that electric lighting will be necessary only at night.
As with many Sustainable.TO projects, the exterior features a highly reflective, self-venting Galvalume roof (and siding), and the operable clerestory windows will aid in exhausting warm air in summer. Walls are to be constructed with structural insulated panels (SIPs), which create a tighter seal with less thermal bridging.
Interestingly, the home Sustainable.TO designed originally - the one that won the competition - was for a much wider, fictional lot. Still in the shotgun model (with rooms all lined up and accessed from one hallway running along a wall), the home was a single-storey dwelling. When fiction became reality, however, and a real site was chosen, Mr. Discenza rallied the team to alter the design so it could be delivered in a mere two-and-a-half days. "There was a bit of tweaking involved," he says.
At a materials cost of between $50,000 and $75,000 (the high end is for a home with recommended upgrades that will save more energy and offer low-maintenance materials), Mr. Dowsett doesn't think the Lyons's home will be a one-off. This is especially true since one of the other partners in the Designing Recovery competition is the New Orleans-based St. Bernard Project, which since 2006 has worked tirelessly to rebuild homes for Katrina survivors. This organization, which has now branched out to New York, "understands the momentum that needs to follow a competition win like this, which is great," says Mr. Dowsett.
There is no doubt our world is changing. With sea levels rising, "fully-finished basements with livable spaces may not be something that insurance companies are terribly thrilled to entertain any more," says Mr. Dowsett. And even homes built with future disasters in mind, such as the ones built by Mr. Pitt's Make It Right foundation immediately after Katrina, will, in future, need to rely less on "the latest technological gadgets," such as solar panels and heat recovery ventilators, and more on a "back-to-basics" approach like the Sustainable.TO design. In some cases, six-year-old houses in New Orleans are being abandoned because owners can't afford to maintain their complex systems. "They're walking away from them," laments Mr. Dowsett.
"Those are 'green' houses, but they're not resilient houses," finishes Mr. Discenza.

LISTING AGENT
Christopher Bibby, Sutton Group-Associates Realty Inc.
The Action: A deal was written for this one-bedroom plus den suite not long after more than two dozen buyers ventured through the front doors of Seventy5 Portland in the trendy King West neighbourhood.
What They Got: Less than five years ago, local developer Peter Freed and international designer Philippe Starck teamed up to create a modern mid-rise home to this 764-square-foot unit with nine-foot, exposed concrete ceilings, hardwood floors and walls of south-facing windows throughout.
* For easy cooking and cleaning, there is a sleek Scavolini kitchen with Corian countertops and stainless-steel appliances, including a gas stove, and a terrace with gas and water outlets off the living and dining area, plus laundry facilities and a bathroom accessible from the master suite and open den.
* The unit comes with a locker and monthly fee of $338. Heat and hydro are extra.
The Agent's Take: "What concerned me initially was the fact this was on a lower floor facing into a concrete wall, but in the end, it provided such a private setting on the south side of the building, no one really minded it," says agent Christopher Bibby.
"The developer did an exceptional job with the type of finishes people were able to choose from, which made the building so much fun to live in and it really stands out from everything in the area."
Even the stylish lobby and corridors struck a chord with buyers. "The design of the common areas was by well-known interior designer Philippe Starck, so that's one thing that's quite appealing," Mr. Bibby adds.
"The designs seem to be more forward than other buildings in the area. It didn't feel like a building in Toronto."

Tech bubble then, Chinese real estate now: No, it's not different this time

Abstract: There are numerous cracks appearing in the China growth story, and just like the late 1990s, market commentators are arguing "it's different this time," that the $3.1-trillion in dodgy local government debt doesn't matter, that it's okay to construct apartment buildings that will remain empty because only speculators can afford them.

On April 12, 1996, I stood behind one of the head institutional traders at Merrill Lynch Canada and watched Yahoo Inc. stock triple in value in its first hour as a publicly traded company. It was pure speculative mania ungrounded in anything resembling fundamental value. We knew it couldn't last, but for three years it did; indeed the Nasdaq stock index itself would rise another 600 per cent.
China's real estate and infrastructure boom is showing all the same characteristics as the tech bubble, for similar reasons, and although three more years of speculative fervour is not guaranteed, at some point the end game is likely to resemble late 1999. The final implosion of China's growth miracle will put the final dagger in the resource supercycle that has enriched so many Canadian investors.
One of the central preconditions of a major asset bubble is a funnelling of investment into one specific asset class. In the late 1990s, the tech bubble soaked up the preponderance of new global investment dollars. Between September, 1995, and March, 2000, the tech-heavy Nasdaq outperformed the equal-weighted S & P 500 index by an enormous margin - 659 per cent to 81.5 per cent.
In China, in part due to an illiquid, underperforming equity market, investment assets in the world's second-largest economy are increasingly concentrated in real estate. Forbes magazine recently reported a $2.3-trillion (U.S.) year-over-year increase in Chinese mortgage debt equivalent to almost 25 per cent of GDP.
The end result for both the tech bubble and in China is excess in terms of asset prices. Cisco Systems traded at more than 220 times trailing earnings by March, 2000. In China, year-over-year housing prices are climbing at a 15- to 20-per-cent clip in most regions and they are now the most expensive in the world as a multiple of median wages.
The Atlantic notes how ridiculous things have become: "[T]he mid-range price of an apartment in New York is 6.2 times more than what a typical family makes in a year. By comparison, it would take nearly a quarter-century of earnings to buy a pad in Beijing's capital outright."
There are numerous cracks appearing in the China growth story, and just like the late 1990s, market commentators are arguing "it's different this time," that the $3.1-trillion in dodgy local government debt doesn't matter, that it's okay to construct apartment buildings that will remain empty because only speculators can afford them.
The investor lesson from the tech bubble is that the trees do not grow to the sky. Investment trends - particularly those that start as legitimate and powerful - eventually succumb to over-investment and excessive prices.
The process is the same each time. Capital flows in faster than it can be profitably utilized. Powerful interests - investment bankers in the 1990s, real estate developers and prominent public officials in the current China - are eventually forced into complex financial plate-spinning to try and maintain momentum.
Economic and financial revolutions all go like this and they all end badly. The internal combustion engine - the tech revolution of the 19th century - created the British railway bubble and another in the U.S. auto industry in the 1920s. More recently, mortgage securitization resulted in the U.S. housing bubble.
China's economic revolution will likely go the same way, although hopefully less dramatically. It won't be the end of the world. Much in the same way that the vast majority of British railways were built after the investment bubble collapsed, the eventual burning off of bad debt and economic restructuring (toward household consumption) will put China on a sustainable, investable growth path.
Predicting the exact timing of market tops is a mug's game even in cases like China, where all of the signs of credit stress are already clear. The trick for Canadian investors will be getting out of the way, minimizing resource exposure, before China's economy reaches its version of March, 2000.

Abstract: CREA chief economist Gregory Klump said that just because a listing appears more than once online, does not mean it is included more than once in the statistics. "The fact is, Realtor.ca is not the basis on which we do our statistics," he said, referring to CREA's website. "Just because something is duplicately listed on Realtor.ca doesn't mean that it's duplicately counted in sales and in active listings."

Full text:   REAL ESTATE REPORTER
Canada's surprisingly strong real estate market is leading to heightened scrutiny of the data used to assess sales.
The main source of information about residential sales and prices is the Canadian Real Estate Association, which represents more than 100,000 real estate agents across the country. On or around the 15th day of each month, after obtaining and working with numbers from local real estate boards, CREA releases information about the previous month's sales levels.
As people try to make sense of the market's twists and turns, some are raising questions about the accuracy of CREA's statistics. One of the main critics is former Member of Parliament and blogger Garth Turner, who has recently been calling CREA's numbers into question on his blog www.greaterfool.ca. He alleged, among other things, that the numbers are being distorted by real estate agents listing one house with two or three local real estate boards (so more buyers will see the listing).
Mr. Turner's skepticism caught the attention of other analysts. Douglas Porter, Bank of Montreal's chief economist, saw the blog. "I found it fascinating."
"Just like any other economic data, I don't think any single number should be treated as the final gospel," Mr. Porter said. "There is a margin for error around every economic statistic, and we take it with a grain of salt, but I think the CREA numbers do a good job of capturing the trend."
CREA chief economist Gregory Klump said that just because a listing appears more than once online, does not mean it is included more than once in the statistics. "The fact is, Realtor.ca is not the basis on which we do our statistics," he said, referring to CREA's website. "Just because something is duplicately listed on Realtor.ca doesn't mean that it's duplicately counted in sales and in active listings."
Mr. Porter noted that unless dual listings were a new or growing issue, there would not likely be a great impact on comparisons, such as how this September's house sales compared with last September's. "We're just trying to get a sense of whether the market is strengthening or weakening or stable," he said.
Questions have also been raised about revisions local real estate boards make to their numbers, which are not immediately captured in CREA's national statistics. For example, the Toronto Real Estate Board counts a sale when an unconditional offer is accepted or when non-title conditions are removed, rather than when the sale closes, Mr. Klump said in an e-mail. If a deal later falls through, the board revises its numbers for the month in question.
CREA does not revise its numbers each month, but rather on a schedule that it says minimizes distortions to comparisons. "It may be argued that TREB's methodology produces a more accurate picture of history once all revisions have been incorporated, and it may also be argued that CREA's methodology produces more historically comparable statistics for the current month being reported on," Mr. Klump said.
Confusion has also arisen from seasonal adjustments CREA makes to its monthly data, which Mr. Klump noted it does using methods from Statistics Canada.

The Action: In the cluster of high-rises hugging Yonge Street and Highway 401, several suites were available this summer, including this two-bedroom-plus-den unit at the Skymark Centre at Avondale. It sold in a timely fashion after more than two dozen buyers were steered through.
What They Got: In a two-tower complex by Tridel, this 23rd-floor suite features a modern design with a classic feel given its nine-foot ceilings, crown mouldings and hardwood floors in the den, the dining area off the kitchen and open living space with a south-east facing balcony.
* For privacy, there are two carpeted bedrooms, both with full bathrooms, one with a walk-in closet and another with his and her closets.
* There are two lockers and two parking spots for this unit, which owes monthly fees of $741 for water, 24-hour concierge and facilities for swimming, tennis, bowling, billiards and virtual golf.
The Agent's Take: "[This unit] was smaller, but meticulously maintained," agent Mark Oulahen said. "It has clear south views, so you can see the whole of downtown."
In addition, local attractions were a perk. "It's close to everything - there's a Whole Foods and Metro coming in - the subway is there and there are very nice parks," adds Mr. Oulahen. "It's a big picnic for all condominium owners on that street."

Abstract: The shopping strip along Dundas Street (where Duke will go), on the other hand, has always been on the seedy side, and it still is. Stores are small, mean and dull. One good thing Duke promises to do is to provide fresh, high-ceilinged retail spaces along the glassy bottom of its Dundas Street façade. This move should, in turn, attract small-scale entrepreneurs angling for the higher-income consumers who are settling in the houses around.

Full text:   Commercial revitalization and a stylish exterior make for a much-needed one-two punch
jmays@globeandmail.com
Eight years ago, Ontario's provincial government bucked the opposition of powerful suburban real-estate interests and decreed that, henceforth, expected population increases in the Greater Toronto Area would have to be accommodated within existing built-up towns and cities. We've been getting used to the fallout from that decision ever since.
It hasn't been easy. People in traditionally low-rise neighbourhoods are often dismayed by mid-rise intensification along the arterial streets that run through their districts. There has been citizen push-back against mid-rise infill on Queen Street West and in the Beaches, on Yonge Street and elsewhere. What the provincial and city planners have in mind for our Victorian and Edwardian urban fabric is clearly not to everyone's taste.
As time goes by, however, I think we may become more tolerant of the assortment of scales and textures in old shopping streetscapes. After all, increasing residential density on principal thoroughfares is a far more hospitable and sustainable way to welcome residents than banishment to suburbia. And for their part, the architects of these new buildings are often ensuring that the infill is alert and lively, and a contribution to the visual vitality of Toronto's downtown area.
Take, for example, the residential development by TAS DesignBuild called Duke. This six-storey condominium block is to be dropped into the heart of Toronto's west-side Junction area, which spreads out in all directions from the intersection of Dundas Street West and Keele Street.
The old residential zones in this part of town have had their ups and downs, usually in tandem with the hard-hat industries and artisanal workplaces that have called the district home since the last third of the 19th century. But the rough edges are being rubbed off by the same process of gentrification that is transforming historic neighbourhoods across the city.
The shopping strip along Dundas Street (where Duke will go), on the other hand, has always been on the seedy side, and it still is. Stores are small, mean and dull. One good thing Duke promises to do is to provide fresh, high-ceilinged retail spaces along the glassy bottom of its Dundas Street façade. This move should, in turn, attract small-scale entrepreneurs angling for the higher-income consumers who are settling in the houses around. The result could be the commercial revitalization of a place badly in need of it.
But if renderings and plans can be believed, the whole project, not just the stores in its base, will be a shot in the arm for what's become a grey, run-down streetscape.
Designed by Toronto-based Quadrangle Architects, the building will turn its most vividly animated face to Dundas. Instead of confronting the street with a solid, straight wall of masonry and glass, the surface of the façade dodges in and out, as if chunks of material had been randomly sliced from it and lifted away. White brick contrasts with the black frames of windows and doors, a difference that lends energy to the attractively jaunty exterior treatment and that makes the structure stand out from the dark brown brick storefronts in its vicinity.
Viewed from the street, the façade will operate at two scales. One is that of the whole building, a box-like item, with set-back upper storeys, that fully occupies its rectangular lot at the corner of Dundas West and Indian Grove. The other scale is that of the individual housing units, each type different, each articulated on the exterior by the in-and-out, back-and-forth rhythm I just noted.
This doubling of scales will mean that the structure will speak of itself in two ways.
One is as an all-encompassing architectural gesture - something it has to do in order to hold its own in a jumble of mostly low, elderly buildings. We expect condo blocks to behave boldly and frankly in this manner, and to avoid pretending that they are anything other than big, muscular contemporary interventions in the urban landscape.
But by expressing every discrete kind of habitation in the exterior treatment, Quadrangle also prompts Duke to speak of itself as a collection of individual homes - a vertical neighbourhood, in other words, of singles and couples and small families, each with a unique character and destiny. More firmly than any other feature, this break-up of the large statement into person-sized utterances links Duke to the Junction community, and gives it the sense of belonging there.
None of which, I'm sure, will change the mind of anyone who staunchly believes that the construction of mid-rise dwellings on important Toronto streets is an accursed business. But as Duke and other buildings of its sort come on line, they should at least convince the disbelievers that some local architects are thinking imaginatively and well about the next chapter in this city's history.

Full text:   The 2010 Winter Olympics cost more than $7-billion to stage, but they were worth it because they spurred major infrastructure developments that helped transform Vancouver and Whistler, a new study concludes.
But while Canada got an image boost and felt a surge of national pride, the tangible benefits have mostly been enjoyed by the two host cities, says Rob VanWynsberghe, an education professor at the University of British Columbia who researched the event for the Canadian Olympic Committee.
"I think Vancouver and Whistler did well. ... I wouldn't say the same for the province or the country," he said Wednesday.
"I think the overall lesson is that these are a very specific kind of phenomena. If you want to look at impacts you focus on the host city ... there's spillover, but it's not sea to shining sea."
The Olympics were a galvanizing force in B.C. for several years leading up to 2010, but the long-term social and economic impacts have been unclear.
The report states that the Games did not provide a significant boost in tourism, nor did the event appear to significantly change the international images of Vancouver or Whistler.
Compared with Edmonton and Toronto, Vancouver and Whistler had no significant increase in tourism in 2010 over 2009. "This finding suggests that being an event region had little to no effect on the number of overnight tourists during the event year," the study states.
The report also says the Games "did not appear to have influenced the attractiveness of the host [cities] with respect to either Consumer Price Index or the [value of the] real estate market ... [with] no unusual change in either."
But the study found there were major benefits in the form of three massive infrastructure projects - the Sea-to-Sky Highway upgrade, which changed a dangerous, winding mountain road into a safer, faster highway; the construction of the Canada Line, which provided rapid transit to Vancouver International Airport and several communities on the route; and the Vancouver Convention Centre, which gave the city a large, modern conference venue overlooking the harbour.
Those projects, along with a flurry of smaller developments - including new community centres, the Olympic Village in Whistler and the Richmond Olympic Oval - drove up the cost of the Games, but gave Whistler and Vancouver developments the cities might never have seen.
And those projects were largely paid for by the provincial and federal governments. The report states that for every $12 spent by Ottawa and B.C. on the three big projects, local taxpayers contributed only $1.
"Residents paid little in direct taxes to get great infrastructure ... it is a good deal," said Prof. VanWynsberghe.
He said the findings show how local communities were able to use the Games to get funding from higher levels of government.
"The best way to think about this is in terms of leveraging ... and what you are attempting to do is use the vehicle of the event to achieve other public policy objectives," he said. "Arguably the Sea-to-Sky Highway, the Canada Line, the Convention Centre, the community centres, those are the other public policy objectives that you are trying to achieve - and the Games provided the vehicle for doing that."
Prof. VanWynsberghe said one intangible social benefit was the impact the Games had on public attitudes about people with disabilities.
He said polling done before and after the Games showed that because of the high profile given to Paralympians in 2010, "People are more willing to consider hiring people with disabilities, people are more willing to consider athletes with disabilities true athletes ... so that is a positive legacy."

Full text:   Blake Hutcheson CEO, Oxford Properties Group
REAL ESTATE REPORTER
I am meeting Blake Hutcheson, the CEO of Oxford Properties Group Inc ., at his office for lunch, but as I walk up to the Bay Street tower a stream of people is rushing out and a guard shoos me away from the main doors.
The building, which is also home to the head office of the Royal Bank of Canada, is having a fire drill. When I reach his office, Mr. Hutcheson, 52, has just returned from outside.
Our lunch meeting is in his office, at his request, so I'm surprised he didn't just hunker down inside. But Mr. Hutcheson, who runs an organization that manages $27-billion of real estate assets, has an appreciation for all of the little things that go into making office towers, shopping malls and hotels work. And Oxford, as one of the owners of this landmark skyscraper in Toronto's financial district, runs the building. Besides, he says, participating in the fire drill is just the right thing to do.
Indeed, as we talk, I get the sense that Mr. Hutcheson never strays too far from the right thing to do.
That doesn't mean he won't take risks. Oxford was the first developer to publicly unveil plans for a potential $3-billion casino complex in the heart of Toronto, before the city had decided if it even wanted a casino.
But he won't press his agenda at any cost. As the casino debate heated up in the early months of this year, some of the players went to great lengths to lobby local politicians and influence public opinion. Not Oxford.
"I would say I'm very proud of the way we conducted ourselves," Mr. Hutcheson says. "We went out and said, 'If the city wants one, we're here with a catcher's mitt.'... We never weighed in on whether they should or shouldn't, and all the way we never said anything I regret."
Oxford's proposal would have seen the Metro Toronto Convention Centre, which the company bought in 2011, turned into "Oxford Place" in one of the largest urban redevelopment projects in North America. It would have included retail, office and residential space, and a revamped convention centre. But city council ultimately decided against allowing a casino.
Oxford has shelved its plans to redevelop the site for the time being. "But we're okay," Mr. Hutcheson says. "The main thing I really cared about is I just wanted to make sure we conducted ourselves professionally; it was a sensitive issue."
In some ways, Mr. Hutcheson was destined to run a real estate company. His first development project came at age 25, in his hometown of Huntsville, deep in the heart of Ontario's cottage country. He built a courthouse that his family still owns and leases to the province.
"I realized that you could get debt against value, as opposed to construction costs," says Mr. Hutcheson, who still hasn't had more than three bites of the grilled chicken, quinoa and salad we've been dining on. "And that you could actually borrow 100 per cent of the construction cost for a good development project. And I thought real estate was easy."
It spurred him to pursue a master's degree in real estate development at Columbia University in New York, where he was exposed to guest lecturers like Donald Trump and legendary developer William Zeckendorf. His best friend there was Mark McGoldrick, who would go on to earn the nickname Goldfinger at Goldman Sachs where, according to the Wall Street Journal, he "delivered a big chunk of the firm's 2006 profits."
After Columbia, Mr. Hutcheson and Mr. McGoldrick worked at a small development company that Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce had started. Mr. McGoldrick left to go to Goldman, and Mr. Hutcheson left to join the real estate brokerage that would become CB Richard Ellis. He would eventually lead the Canadian and Latin American operations, with responsibility for 2,500 employees.
Fourteen years later, his old friend called with a new opportunity. Mr. McGoldrick had left Goldman and was looking to start a private equity firm called Mount Kellett. Mr. Hutcheson joined the venture, which launched in 2008, and began commuting from Toronto to New York to head up its real estate investments.
By this time, he was a family man, married to Susan Farrow Hutcheson, whom he had met during high school. ("I had a crush on her when I was at Upper Canada College, but she was always dating someone else and so was I, so I didn't really get a chance to capitalize on it until 1992," he says. "I took her out on one date and said, that's the mother of my children.") The couple had two children and commuting from Toronto to New York was taking its toll.
"I've been told I was Porter [Airlines'] best customer for two years," he says. "If I tried to get home for one of my kids' soccer games I'd literally fly home, go to a soccer game, get back on an airplane."
In 2008, the financial crisis wreaked havoc on the global economy and on the real estate business. Mr. Hutcheson was scouring the world for distressed properties while helping Mount Kellett set up offices in Mumbai, Hong Kong and London. "It became clear to me that I either move my family [to New York] and make that my life or get home," Mr. Hutcheson says. He took the top job at Oxford, the real estate arm of the Ontario Municipal Employees' Retirement System, one of Canada's largest pension funds, and started in early 2010.
When he took the helm at Oxford, OMERS was in the midst of a transition, shifting its asset mix from stocks and bonds to investments in real estate and infrastructure. That makes Oxford, and Mr. Hutcheson, increasingly important to the fund. It's also one of the more profitable units, posting a 16.9-per-cent return last year, while OMERS' portfolio of stocks and bonds generated a 7.5-per-cent return.
In the years since Mr. Hutcheson has taken the helm, Oxford's growth rate has been spectacular. In 2010, he set a goal of roughly doubling assets under management in five years, from about $16-billion to about $30-billion (that's $10-billion of equity, $10-billion of debt and $10-billion in partnerships). Two years later, it's already getting close.
Mr. Hutcheson made a splash in his first year, with the purchase of a 50-per-cent stake in Hudson Yards, a high-profile project on 26 acres in West Manhattan that includes office, retail, hotel, residential and school developments and will be the basis for a new neighbourhood near Midtown.
This year, it struck a prestigious deal with The Crown Estate, a British real estate company that manages the Windsor estate and other property of the Crown, to build a 260,000-square-foot office and retail complex in London's St. James's Market.
"We're changing cities," he says. His travel schedule continues to be punishing, with regular visits to New York, London and Paris.
It's a work ethic that seems bred in to him. Mr. Hutcheson's grandfather and his brothers turned their father's planing mill into a hardwood flooring company that employed hundreds of people in a town that, at the time, had a population in the thousands. His father built roads, farmed and sold beach volleyball sand that was used in the Olympics.
Mr. Hutcheson maintains close ties to his extended family, speaking to one of his older brothers, Scott, the CEO of Calgary-based Aspen Properties, nearly every day and to his father nearly as often. His sister lives a couple blocks away in Toronto.
As we chat, he pulls out his notes for a speech he's giving to some key employees the following day; it talks about character, honesty, integrity and ethics. It refers to a culture that is "a little bit Wall Street and a little bit Huntsville."

Full text:   A cash-strapped Burnaby Legion and a developer seeking increased density create a mutually beneficial partnership
You couldn't find more unlikely business partners than 37-year-old Angelo Tsakumis and 65-year-old David Taylor. Mr. Tsakumis, head of development for family firm EPTA Properties, wears the latest fashions and drives a luxury SUV, while Taylor, a retired Teamster and current president of Legion 148 on Hastings Street in Burnaby, prefers T-shirts and baseball caps and drives a Harley.
When the two first met at a public consultation for EPTA's mixed use Montage project - a few blocks from the legion in Burnaby Heights - they hardly saw eye to eye. "Dave was the only guy who opposed the rezoning," recalls Mr. Tsakumis, as he smiles at Mr. Taylor across what was once the dance floor of the soon-to-be-demolished Legion.
But in the end, it was a partnership between the two that saved the flagging fortunes of the Legion - beset by a declining membership and high property taxes - and offered increased density in an up-and-coming area.
A hybrid mixed-use development project, which breaks ground this month and will be completed in 2015, is an intriguing blend of old and new. The Chris Dikeakos-designed four-storey low-rise will fuse a new purpose-built Legion hall with 28 residential units. The Legion will benefit from much-needed revenue producing ground-floor retail and upper-floor office space, and the neighbourhood will be able to keep the local mom and pop vibe that, combined with its easy access to Vancouver via the Hastings corridor, makes it such a popular area.
As Mr. Taylor looks over the boxes of poppies and various military memorabilia he must sort through before demolition begins, he waxes nostalgic. "I used to run the meat draws here every Friday and Saturday night. But I made it lot of fun, telling jokes and getting everyone in a good mood," he says.
"This building was started by a handful of veterans in 1936, but back then it was just an old shack," he says. Then in the mid-fifties, the five city lots that currently comprise the existing building and parking lot were fused into a single entity with a large extension. But like so much of the old building stock in the area, maintenance costs, along with higher taxes, strained the resources of the Legion. Anti-smoking laws introduced after 2000 also significantly reduced membership.
For eight years, Mr. Taylor petitioned bureaucrats at all levels of government to help save the Burnaby Heights Legion, but to no avail. Gradually he came to realize the only way to survive was to put out a call for proposals from developers.
"I was at a meeting in late 2011 with Burnaby Mayor Derrick Corrigan," says Mr. Tsakumis, "when he mentioned that I might want to have a chat with the local Legion president." When the two met, Mr. Tsakumis remembered Mr. Taylor immediately as the very vocal opponent of his Montage development.
But a friendship soon formed between the two and over lunch at a local café they sat down and hashed out the details.
"I just listened to what Dave said the Legion needed and worked from there," Mr. Tsakumis says. The key issues were that the Legion wanted to maintain its independence, its address and prominent Hastings Street frontage. It also needed revenue-generating space.
The design reflects the nature of the conjoined enterprises - housed in a single building with a fire wall separation and separate air-space parcelling - with EPTA managing the 28 units and ground-floor retail on its western end, and the legion occupying a third of the space on the eastern flank.
A separate entrance for the Legion's retail and office space will feature a private elevator, while a single underground parking garage for all tenants will streamline usage and maximize floor space for retail and residential.
Dikeakos's design for the Legion includes large-scale vertical and horizontal glazing to maximize north-facing light and create a sense of openness to the Hastings corridor and surrounding neighbourhood. Red brick that delineates the glazing and a flat white roof make reference to the proud Canadian tradition of the Legion.
The housing units feature deep, recessed balconies that create textural variation and differentiate the residential units from the flatter-planed commercial aesthetic of the Legion area. Green roofing along the ledge of the ground-floor retail engages the streetscape and embraces the surrounding community.
"I hate to see this old place come down," says Mr. Taylor, as he sifts through old Legion bric-a-brac, signage and retro-treasures, some of which will be saved and reincorporated into the new building. "It's so full of memories."
But he also hopes new members will be attracted to the Legion, which now competes for clientele with the likes of Cactus Club and Earls as well as the burgeoning Burnaby Heights food and beverage scene.
"We've even had a few old-timers inquire about the possibility of buying into the new building," he says.
Mr. Tsukamis says he is delighted to be able to contribute to the "reinvigoration of a neighbourhood institution."
In fact, the mixed-use model EPTA has developed has prompted interest from other Legions in B.C., which also hope that a new take on an old tradition will help keep them alive.

A home calm but alert, minimal without stinginess

Author: John Bentley Mays

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/home-calm-alert-minimal-without-stinginess/docview/1442612001/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: No such contextual constraints shaped the interior, of course, so AKB (and the office's design collaborator, Ashley Botten) could do the tailoring entirely according to their own (and their clients') taste. The attractive mood inside - calm but alert, gracious without fussiness, minimal without any stinginess at all - is generated by a scheme that modernism has made seem timeless.

Full text:   Atelier Kastelic Buffey's South Hill house gives a young family of five a space that blends harmony and beauty
jmays@globeandmail.com
The Swiss architect Peter Zumthor has spoken of architectural atmosphere as "this singular density and mood, this feeling of presence, well-being, harmony, beauty" that some buildings embody well.
People on the trail of the perfect house, or who think about architecture at all, are always on the look-out for such atmosphere. And, indeed, one occasionally finds this sense of belonging and homecoming in the single-family homes and even in the residential high-rises we visit. But when we do discover it, the atmosphere is rarely delivered with more tact and clean, quiet grace than I experienced last week in a new house in the South Hill neighbourhood in midtown Toronto.
The dwelling was designed for a young family of five by a team at Atelier Kastelic Buffey (AKB), a local architectural and design firm whose principals, as it happens, have been studying and learning from the work of Zumthor for several years.
They definitely know a thing or two about creating atmosphere.
The exterior geometry of this two-storey, 7,000-square-foot house is plain and clear, composed of a pair of simple oblongs stacked, one atop the other, on a rectangular city lot. The spacious, elegant gestures of the street-side façade, which is clad in large, smooth slabs of Indiana limestone, make the building look as if it had been sculpted from massive blocks of rock.
Yet there is nothing ponderous about AKB's outside treatment. Wide, deeply recessed horizontal windows open the interior to light, and a tall window by the front door frames a view that carries the eye right through the entry level, through floor-to-ceiling glass walls at the rear, and into the back garden. Without turning the structure into a transparent modernist box - something the clients did not want - AKB made it permeable, and they have banished the heaviness that might have come from using so much stone on the exterior.
The statement made by the building's front is somewhat retiring. Designers Kelly Buffey and Robert Kastelic told me they pulled back the boldness of the exterior out of respect for the other houses up and down the street, which tends to be populated by Tudor, Georgian or eclectic Edwardian pastiches. While they probably should not have bothered - those storybook dwellings can take care of themselves - this move has not made the façade timid or hesitant. It stands up for itself, as a refined instance of modern abstraction.
No such contextual constraints shaped the interior, of course, so AKB (and the office's design collaborator, Ashley Botten) could do the tailoring entirely according to their own (and their clients') taste. The attractive mood inside - calm but alert, gracious without fussiness, minimal without any stinginess at all - is generated by a scheme that modernism has made seem timeless. There are tall white walls, warm oak floors, sparse but well-chosen contemporary furnishings, and a dramatic, oak-framed staircase that rises from the double-height foyer and is brightened by a large skylight.
No visible supports or bulkheads interrupt the flow of space on the ground level, since all the framing and electro-mechanical innards of the house have been hidden away inside walls and the extra-wide intervals between floors. But AKB has avoided the spatial blankness that sometimes makes open-plan interiors seem vacant, unlived-in, by lightly defining each area unto itself. The living room ensemble, for example, occupies a sunken, inward-looking, intimate place, while the dining table stands in an elevated, more exposed position near the entrance hall. The separation of these zones is subtle, but aesthetically effective, and the interior sings.
What's remarkable about this house, however, is its simultaneous success as both an contemporary artistic entity and as a flexible, accommodating home for a couple with three small and active children. The couple wanted a skylit entrance hall where they could entertain, for example. But how to keep it clear of every family's usual mess of mitts and coats and boots? Just an oversized closet would not do, so AKB installed a full room off the foyer (camouflaged as a closet) with cubbyholes, hangers and cabinets for everyone's gear.
In the basement, in addition to the obligatory family room, AKB has put an ample, hard-surfaced compartment dedicated to nothing but kids' crafts. In the living-room area, the television screen is hidden behind a dark, sliding steel screen. The kitchen seems eerily bare because all the appliances and dishes are so deftly tucked away. Throughout the house, it's the same story everywhere: storage, and more storage, and concealment of everything that can be concealed.
The result is a dwelling that is as efficient as it is handsome. It communicates the "presence, well-being, harmony, beauty" of all solid residential architecture (in whatever style) that's worthy of our attention.

For some, winning an award means the pressure is off; it's now time to sit back and take stock. For others, such as Scadding Court Community Centre (SCCC) executive director Kevin Lee and the many micro entrepreneurs who work outside his doorstep, it's a challenge: how can we do more of this, and do it better?
Since 2011, Market 707, a tidy row of shipping containers stretching along Dundas Street West east of Bathurst, has been a colourful, thriving and busy model of how to create a community where there was none before. A panel of judges agreed, and went so far as to create a special jury award to celebrate the project, which was handed out last month at Toronto's Urban Design Awards.
Offering everything from coffee and crepes to ethnic food and bicycle repair, Market 707 was the brainchild of Mr. Lee upon his return from a trip to Ghana with a youth group. While the containers there were more primitive than the ones he'd ultimately see set up in Toronto, he marvelled at how these utilitarian structures were so versatile.
"It's something that Toronto has not had, from a public realm perspective [and] from an architectural perspective," he says with characteristic energy. "It's limitless what you can do with these things."
Architect Dean Goodman, who has been working on studies for an expansion of the community centre since the mid-2000s, agrees. Shipping containers, he says, are "so pedestrian, on the one hand, whatever you do to them makes it better; from a design standpoint, that's a wonderful thing." Mr. Goodman's firm, LGA Architectural Partners, helped get the original Market 707 in place, which featured food vendors operating out of containers with a window cut into the side. When the market was ready to expand into retail, Mr. Goodman suggested a small group travel to the Dekalb Market in Brooklyn, where containers are handled differently: one end is sliced off and replaced with a glass wall and door, thereby creating a small store. "Oh, that's how you do retail," remembers Scadding Community Engagement Manager Nikki Toten. "It actually feels like a really cool store - there was room for five of us to be standing around looking at jewellery."
What else is really cool is what these humble little containers have done to give start-up businesses a leg up. Scadding Court charges vendors a meagre $10 per day in rent because, says Mr. Lee, "that piece is missing" in a system that is trained to think only about macro economics. With such small financial risk, those who might never have thought of opening a business, such as a newly arrived immigrant, can do so here; already, a few of the vendors have moved to a bricks-and-mortar location after a year at Market 707.
"We like to say that there are organizations out there that will help you build your business case, but no one that'll help you get a case for your business," laughs Ms. Toten.
And not only has SCCC provided those very real cases, they've transformed the surrounding neighbourhood into something unthinkable; before 2011, shoppers exiting the Kensington Market area never went further west in search of interesting food or merchandise. Now, that gap in the urban fabric has been filled. Further, these new "eyes on the street" have made things safer for local residents. In summer, says Mr. Goodman, some LGA employees come and use the pool, then have lunch at the market. In fact, Market 707 has been so successful, not only is there talk of expanding it to create a "container mall," the concept may soon reach other parts of the city. Mr. Lee and Ms. Toten are working with the Centre for Spanish Speaking Peoples to create a new market on land owned by the Toronto Community Housing Corporation at Jane St. and Wilson Ave. This market will benefit from the knowledge gained at Scadding Court with the "vendor toolkit" that's been created, with includes tips on signage, marketing and the types of government support for which entrepreneurs may be eligible.
"One of the most magical pieces" of the project-and one SCCC didn't anticipate-is the vendors support for one another, says Mr. Lee. The businesses have started a group that collects a small amount of money each month to buy things such as lighting and advertising.
This is not surprising, really, when one considers the magic that takes place within the walls of SCCC: the Oasis Skateboard Factory, which teaches kids "creative and entrepreneurial skills"; the many sports programs, especially basketball; the "emergency and occasional child care" that helps parents during periods of new employment; newcomer services; and a surreal event each June, "Gone Fishin'," that transforms the pool into a lake with rainbow trout.
Of course this type of magic requires many minds, hands, and a frenetic pace, where awards are only signposts on a long, long journey.

LISTING AND CO-OP AGENTS
Cameron Weir and Scott Hanton, Keller Williams Advantage Realty
The Action: This detached Leslieville dwelling was listed for $699,000 while many house hunters were on summer vacation and others, while seriously interested, were not ready to commit. So it was relisted in the mid-$700,000s and purchased by a local resident alerted of the property's availability via the marketing materials of realtors Cameron Weir and Scott Hanton.
What They Got: In the last six years, several changes took place throughout this more-than-a-century-old home, first evident from the resealed mutual driveway and new roofing for the garage and solar panel system.
* Practical improvements inside the 1,605-square-foot space include new mechanics and energy-efficient lighting, as well as a new mudroom with cork floors, carpeting in all three bedrooms upstairs and two remodelled bathrooms.
* Hardwood floors and crown mouldings add a sense of tradition to the living room, dining area and open eat-in kitchen and fireside family room with a walkout to a fenced-in yard and deck wired with gas and sound systems.
* For extra space, there is a 670-square-foot basement with a recreation room.
The Agent's Take: "It's a detached home on a 24-by 115-foot lot with a garage and two-car parking," says Mr. Weir. "It was structurally sound and everything was recently done, so it was pretty move-in ready."
Buyers also appreciated niceties such as the solar-powered system generating monthly checks, "which is way more than the current heating and hydro costs, so they can pay for those and have some money left over," Mr. Weir adds. "Both bathrooms have heated floors and all the rooms were quite a nice size."

Abstract: "It can be very satisfying to move to a small community from a large one," said Mariella Vigneux, an Owen Sound resident and a professional coach specializing in retirement lifestyle planning through her company, Crabapple Coaching. "You're there to put down roots. It's not another stepping stone on the career ladder. You're retiring and you're willing to invest yourself in a new community."

Full text:   Moving to a smaller community means cheaper housing, with lots of money left over
rcarrick@globeandmail.com
Some of retirement's toughest financial challenges can be solved in a single move.
Just relocate to a smaller community. Seniors are doing this all the time and it's generally cast as a lifestyle decision. But there are clear financial advantages as well.
Savings last longer when you cut your cost of living, and housing problems can be addressed as well. City-dwellers often find the condo or bungalow they expect to buy in retirement uses up most of the money they make from selling the family home. Moving to a smaller community means cheaper housing, and lots of money left over.
Let's look at a quick case study: Owen Sound, Ont., which topped a list of the 10 nicest Canadian cities to which to retire in an article that appeared on the MSN Money website last year (read it online at goo.gl/A1qUIX). I happened to visit the city recently to do a talk at a local library and I asked around about the benefits of relocating there.
To set the scene, Owen Sound is a Southwestern Ontario city located about two and a half hours from Toronto by car. About 22,000 people live there, the average house price is about $190,000 and the average property tax bill is in the area of $3,100, according to Steve Furness, manager of economic development and tourism for the city. "It's a very walkable and driveable community in a beautiful setting," Mr. Furness said.
Owen Sound is right on Georgian Bay and the Bruce Trail, an 885-kilometre path along the scenic Niagara Escarpment that passes through town. Owen Sound has the nature thing nailed, if that's what you like. Ambience-wise, it resembles a lot of small Southern Ontario communities, with a historic downtown and neighbourhoods full of heritage homes built of brick. There were no Starbucks outlets that I could see, but a place called The Frog Ponds Café poured me a coffee I would rate as A+.
The average detached home in Toronto sold for a bit over $856,000 last month, which compares to $350,000 to $400,000 for a prime Owen Sound-area home. "People like the fact that they can come up from Toronto and afford waterfront property," said Steve Hiscox, a real estate agent at a local ReMax office.
Prefer a condominium? There's a downtown condo project in the preconstruction phase called the Sydenham, where two-bedroom units start at $284,900. You get a definite sense in the sales hype for this project of trying to appeal to city people. "The Sydenham will offer residence owners outstanding luxury amenities never before offered in Owen Sound," the developer's website says.
But what about the lifestyle change in moving from a big city to a small community in retirement - could you be happy?
"It can be very satisfying to move to a small community from a large one," said Mariella Vigneux, an Owen Sound resident and a professional coach specializing in retirement lifestyle planning through her company, Crabapple Coaching. "You're there to put down roots. It's not another stepping stone on the career ladder. You're retiring and you're willing to invest yourself in a new community."
One caveat is to make sure that wherever you relocate, you can easily visit your kids and grandchildren. Ms. Vigneux says she's often struck when talking to people who just had a grandchild by how much joy they get out of it.
Her sensible suggestion for people who are curious about relocating: Try renting a home or cottage in the area for a few weeks or, better, a few months. Check out the weather in summer and winter (Owen Sound isn't especially cold, but they get heaps of snow). See what there is to do, and how friendly the residents are. Find out if there are other retirees from a big city who have already relocated there.
For economic reasons, many small towns and cities want you to relocate. They're losing young adults to the better employment prospects of big cities, and they need to maintain their tax bases. If you do choose to relocate, Ms. Vigneax suggests getting on it as quickly as possible after you retire. "The sooner you get relocated, the better. You've got to get the good living in while you can."

RELOCATION CHECKLIST
Mariella Vigneux, an expert on retirement lifestyle planning, says you're suited to relocating to a small community if you are:
Good at building new friendships
Extroverted
A good learner (for example, will you be able to figure out how septic systems and wells work?)
Pursuing hobbies or interests that will help you meet people

Full text:   In a hot housing market, should Liam and Sophia keep renting or buy a house? The question has paralyzed these savers
Liam and Sophia moved into their place in the Vancouver area 10 years ago. Since then, they've become parents and they've also become entrenched in the community. They love their neighbourhood and their child has settled into the local elementary school.
The only question causing the West Coast couple distress is the same one faced by many Canadians who live in hot housing markets: Should they keep renting or bite the bullet and buy?
Sophia, who works part-time as a caregiver, is tired of renting. When the couple moved into what she describes as a lovely garden-level apartment, they were paying $1,700 a month in rent; now they fork over nearly $2,000. However, her husband, a doctor, isn't keen on purchasing real estate with home prices being what they are in the Vancouver area.
"The amount we've paid in rent is crazy," Sophia says. "For 10 years, I've wanted to buy a house, but my husband was gun-shy, thinking the prices would not keep going up. We can't afford to buy a house in our neighbourhood now, and my husband is trying to convince me to just keep saving money."
Sophia describes herself and her husband, both 50, as good savers. She says the last thing she wants is to be house poor, but she's feeling as though her family is at a crossroads.
"If we are going to move, I would rather do it now," she says. "I'd like the security of knowing we have a home for my daughter that we can call our own, but now I'm wondering if it's the best financial decision. It would cost us about $1-million to get into a detached house in a different neighbourhood."
To help Sophia and Liam, we consulted Vancouver certified financial planner Tom Kelly, wealth adviser at the Granville West Group/Manulife Securities Inc., and Biljana Manojlovic, a private banker with RBC Wealth Management, also in Vancouver.
*****
The basics
Assets:
* Two tax-free savings accounts (TFSAs) totalling $58,622
* Registered education savings plan (RESP): $30,000
* Liam's registered retirement savings plan (RRSP): $457,378
* Sophia's RRSP: $83,560
* Liam's cash savings: $313,573
* Sophia's non-RRSP savings: $300, 278 (in money market funds)
* Chequing account: $58,409
Liabilities:
* Monthly expenses, including car insurance, child's activities and travel: about $5,000
* Rent: $2,000 monthly
*****
Mr. Kelly's tips
1. Begin your planning by defining your ideal lifestyle. "Our wealth is meant to serve us, not the other way around," Mr. Kelly says. "Ask yourselves: If you were to pass away in 10 years and never owned a home of your own with your family, would you be disappointed? If the answer is yes, and you can reasonably afford a home - which you can - then buy the home for the long term and build in as much safety as possible."
To do that, Mr. Kelly suggests the couple purchase life insurance for at least the value of the mortgage, disability insurance to cover a portion of the pair's income, set the mortgage to be paid off in 15 years when they want to retire, and take advantage of today's ultra-low mortgage rates to keep costs fixed during the next five to 10 years.
"The soft benefits of owing a principal residence with your family should not be overlooked," he adds. "You cannot put a price on pride of ownership, control of your environment and stability."
2. Develop a long-term perspective. "The challenge that we all face is to live each day as if we were going to die tomorrow while developing long-term plans as if we were going to live forever," Mr. Kelly says. "Defining your retirement needs and determining how to save in order to reach your goals will help relieve the stress of day-to-day financial decisions. What happens to financial assets tomorrow or over the next year should not be your focus. Putting the odds in your favour to be successful over the next 10, 20, 30 years is what you should try to control.
"In this case, owning a principal residence should be thought of as the best way of growing an asset tax-free over the next 20 years, diversifying your asset base and getting the benefits of living in your own property every day," he adds. "If you can balance this with investments that have the ability to grow at a reasonable rate over this same time period, you will be in great shape."
3. Be more aggressive with your investment portfolio. " Golfers have a saying that 100 per cent of putts that don't make it to the hole won't go in," Mr. Kelly says. "By sitting on cash and not making a decision on buying a home or investing, you're virtually guaranteeing that you are losing money after inflation is factored into the equation. You are excellent savers, so make your savings work for you."
Mr. Kelly suggests the couple take the time to understand more about investing so that they can invest more aggressively with confidence. "With 15 years to retirement, and likely 30 years in retirement, you need to invest largely in high-quality equities with any of your long-term capital that is not needed for a home purchase. In today's investment climate, I would suggest 25 per cent in U.S. equities, 20 per cent in Canadian equities, 20 per cent in international equities, 20 per cent fixed income, and 15 per cent alternative assets as a starting point. "

Ms. Manojlovic's tips
1. Meet with a licensed, accredited financial planner. Creating a financial plan will allow Liam and Sophia to discuss family goals, needs and priorities, Ms. Manojlovic says.
"They will be able to address financial management, budgeting, tax planning, investment planning and risk management, retirement planning, estate planning," she says. "This [owning a home] is a big decision, and by going through the financial planning process, they'll be able to see what that scenario would look like in numbers and what impact would it have on their retirement - their net worth and their cash flow."
Say the couple put a large down payment of $600,000 on a $1-million home, they'd have a mortgage of $400,000, Ms. Manojlovic notes. "Assuming a 25-year amortization, at current interest rates their monthly mortgage payment could be around $2,000, which is what they are paying in rent now, so they could make their dream of owning a home reality," she says. "There is no right or wrong decision when it comes to owning a home. It comes down to the personal value system and priorities."
2. Examine their insurance needs. "If they go ahead and purchase a home, I would strongly advise them to review their life and disability insurance needs," Ms. Manojlovic says. "As the husband is the main income earner, should something happen to him this would put a strain on their finances."
3. Have assets invested according to their investor risk profile. "The large amount of cash in savings and chequing accounts, as well as one TFSA account in money market [funds], and both RRSPs need to be reviewed and properly invested and monitored," Ms. Manojlovic says. "One spouse has a higher income and a much larger RRSP; the other spouse has a smaller RRSP and a pension. Perhaps it would make financial sense to set up a spousal RRSP to equalize their income at retirement."

Full text:   National figures expected to add to streak of strong recent results from local boards
REAL ESTATE REPORTER
Canada's housing market is back on a roll, a finding that should be evident in the September sales data that the Canadian Real Estate Association will release on Tuesday.
The slump that began in the summer of 2012 came to an end this past summer, with sales topping economists' forecasts, and the market showing a surprising amount of momentum.
Preliminary numbers from local real estate boards suggest that September's national figures will continue the streak of strong results. The Toronto Real Estate Board said the number of houses sold in the Toronto area via the Multiple Listing Service during September came in 30 per cent higher than a year earlier, while Calgary's real estate board posted a 19-per-cent increase. Sales in Vancouver, the Canadian city hardest hit during the recent downturn, rose 63.8 per cent from a year ago.
It's worth noting that the market was in the doldrums at this point last year, which inflates the year-over-year comparisons. But the numbers still point to a market that has recovered, and then some. The 7,411 houses sold in the Toronto area was 9.6 per cent higher than the 10-year average for September. Calgary's sales are 14 per cent higher than the long-term average for that month, and Vancouver's sales are now back in line with the average.
Bank of Montreal senior economist Robert Kavcic said he expects that sales nationally will come in about 15 per cent higher than last September, and that prices will have risen by 8 per cent over the year.
While Mr. Kavcic sees the housing market as "pretty balanced and well-behaved," Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce economist Benjamin Tal thinks it is probably too hot for the comfort of regulators and the federal government.
Economists are watching to see how much of the recent strength stems from buyers jumping into the market to lock in preapproved mortgage rates. Some experts expect sales to slide in the next month or two, as that phenomenon wears off in the face of higher rates.
Meanwhile, housing starts continue to top expectations, with developers betting that the market still has legs. Last week, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. said there were 193,637 housing starts in September on an annualized basis. Economists had been forecasting 185,000 starts.

Full text:   Eastern waterfront may be the city's next hot neighbourhood
kgold@globeandmail.com
One of Vancouver's oldest neighbourhoods is comprised of some of its finest old houses and waterfront, and yet, it's remained a quietly hidden gem for most of the city's history.
East side residents know about Wall Street, but city wide, it's largely an unknown. That will change, promises Sotheby's agent Gregg Close, who, along with his son Mackenzie, has taken on his first Wall Street listing at 2523 Wall St. The Battersby Howat designed house is listed at $1.795-million, which is the highest listing price for any home in the area.
Wall is a long, winding street above a bluff overlooking the workings of an industrial port, the freighter-dotted inlet and the North Shore mountains. It's a unique view, the urban answer to Port Grey Road's more sombre, idyllic waterfront.
Mr. Close, who grew up on Point Grey Road and has specialized in selling houses in his west side neighbourhood most of his career, believes that Wall Street is vastly under priced.
"The prices here on Wall are insane," says Mr. Close. "I'm so used to Point Grey Road, where everything there is cheek to jowl. Here you can look right down the channel. This house will be worth $3-million because this street has nowhere to go but up."
Of course, the Closes believe in the area because they have a house to sell, but the fact that Sotheby's has arrived in what was once an intensely working class neighbourhood is a sign of transition. Several years ago, I wrote a story about the first $1-million listing in the city's other old neighbourhood, Strathcona, and today it's hard to believe that anyone even found that shocking.
Considering the shortage of waterfront in Vancouver, it only makes sense that a similar hike in property values would happen on Wall Street. For the last decade, the Hastings Sunrise community has attracted professional urban types who prefer the obscurity of their enclave, which is a short walk to Commercial Drive, a five-minute drive to downtown, and a short drive over the Second Narrows Bridge to some of the best mountain biking in the country. Now that long-time residents are of retiring age and looking to sell their seaside properties, the area is opening to a new market that is starting to recognize the east side version of Point Grey Road.
"All that's missing is a Starbucks," says Mr. Close.
There are already the early signs of a neighbourhood on the upswing, in the form of a few brave independent retailers. Around the corner from Wall Street, on Powell Street, are a couple of indie craft distilleries, including the Odd Society, makers of gin, vodka and whisky, with a stylish new tasting room - and Powell Street Brewing, makers of an India Pale Ale. There is a movement under way by some businesses to rename and rebrand the neighbourhood, including adjacent Grandview-Woodlands, as "the East Village."
Omer Arbel is a celebrated designer best known for his furniture and lighting company, Bocci. His 1942 Wall Street cottage-style house, which he purchased for $1.27-million three years ago, was recently featured in Dwell magazine. He's a recent addition to the neighbourhood, but he's been aware of it for more than a decade, says Mr. Arbel, who moved from Israel when he was a kid. Mr. Arbel's home is located next door to the Sotheby's-listed property, and he has plans for his own major renovation.
"When I could afford to buy and build, there was no question in my mind that it should occur on Wall Street," he says in an e-mail interview from somewhere in Asia. "I feel much more comfortable in East Vancouver than I do in West Vancouver or the North Shore. I love the view of the mountains and the ocean, and the rawness of the proximity to port lands, the trains and large freighters. People have hang-ups about the noise of the train tracks, but personally I love it. I think it's romantic, and I miss it when I travel."
Mr. Arbel is less enamoured of efforts to rebrand the area as a namesake of that famous New York neighbourhood.
"I hate that some misguided individual or group chose to try to rename our neighbourhood. Why replace a beautiful and poetic name [Hastings Sunrise], particular to this place and its history, with a generic name of a neighbourhood in New York? It seems completely against the spirit of the place. Nowhere in the world will you ever find a neighbourhood called Hastings Sunrise. This is something to celebrate, not try to obscure."
Before it was Hastings Sunrise, the area was set aside by the colonial government in the 1860s, and called the Hastings Townsite. Back then, Vancouver was comprised of individual municipalities, and Hastings Townsite became an annex of the city in 1911, following a referendum, says historian John Atkin.
"Because it was far out from the centre the orphanages and delinquent schools, et cetera, were set out there," he says. "They stuck similar institutions way out in West Point Grey on Fourth Avenue as well. But it developed just as other neighbourhoods did, with a mix of incomes and people. The opening of the Pacific National Exhibition helped boost the area's development."
As for the name, Heritage Vancouver's Donald Luxton says nobody knows why it was renamed Wall Street in 1911. Prior to that, it was simply Powell Street.
Change isn't happening instantly on Wall Street. The house at 2523 has been on the market for two years, and is on its third agent. Since Sotheby's took over in May, they say they've had two decent offers, but they believe they can hold out for the asking price.
Last year, the owner of a 1980s-era house on a 66-by-98-foot lot at 2645 Wall listed at $2.450-million without luck. It sat on the market for 126 days.
Elisabeth Obesen, owner of the house at 2523 Wall, has lived there since 2001. She purchased the property and had the house built, but she under built on the property and only allowed for two bedrooms upstairs, which is a setback in terms of its resale, says Mr. Close.
There is still the old, prevailing attitude among locals that the east side should be far cheaper than the west, and that's an outmoded idea, says Ms. Obesen, who is a doctor.
"Vancouverites have a very crazy notion about the east side versus the west side," she says. "Suddenly, just because you've crossed Main Street, they think a house should be really cheap. Those days are over."
Ms. Obesen says she can't afford to live out her retirement years in Vancouver, and so she's selling her dream home, which includes a garden that cost her more than $150,000.
"I wish I could keep my house and retire here, but I can't. That's the reality," she says. "People have this idea that physicians are rich and living high off the hog, and it's just not true. The deal is, if I want to stay in my house, I have to work till I'm 75. I'm not going to work that long. So the options are sell this house ... and move to Panama. That's been on my list at the moment.
"I could hang on and wait [for the price to go up]," she adds. "But I just don't want to."

Full text:   The chillingly good zombie series is a ratings monster, a show that has grown in stature and has a fanatical following
jdoyle@globeandmail.com
The zombies are back - those insatiable critters hounding the few remaining humans who are, in turn, trying to establish some sort of new and safe community time after time.
The Walking Dead (Sunday, AMC, 9 p.m.) returns. It's a ratings monster, a series that has grown in stature and has a fanatical following.
A reason why is the show's deft blend of on-going horror story and sociological analysis. As much as fans adore the brutal battles with the ravenous "walkers," there's a fascinating subtext about people trying to rebuild a society that has been reduced to a brutal nothing.
For all its escapist elements, The Walking Dead is drenched in paranoia and anxiety - what if the structures of society evaporated? What would life be like in a postapocalyptic America where small communities live in fear and try to nourish their own ideas of civilized society? It's dystopian and disturbing drama. Already in the series we've seen the dramatization of the appeal of a fascist leader in such a work, with last season's journey into the society created by the Governor (David Morrissey).
The Governor will be back. Viewers know that because he wasn't wiped out at the end of last season.
He's lurking out there, somewhere, with revenge on his mind, no doubt. And those zombies? Are they evolving, learning to prey on the existing humans with new and horrific tactics?
On the evidence available, this new season starts emphatically with Rick (Andrew Lincoln) and his group trying to live a peaceful, stable life in the prison that is home to them. They farm, try to stay trouble-free and do more than merely survive threats from outside.
The prison community has grown larger with new arrivals, and Rick seems less intent on being a brave and fearless leader. After all, he's lost a great deal.
The series is notorious for wiping out beloved characters, with little care for the affections of the viewers.
This cannot last, of course, this peace. Such is the dark view of the series that all attempts to create normalcy in a safe, peaceful society are doomed. The threats come from both within and without.
Each season of the series has focused on the survivors attempting to find safety in one location.
There was the bleak haven of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there was Hershel's farm and then the prison, with a side trip to the strangeness of Woodbury, the little fascist state created by the Governor. As this season begins in a seemingly peaceful prison setting, one knows that awfulness is coming.
It isn't really odd that The Walking Dead is enormously popular. It's not just about those gory scenes of zombie attacks. It's about our deepest fear - the complete collapse of society. We've seen economic collapse in our lifetime and we worry about everything that sustains us collapsing too.
Also airing this weekend
16x9 (Saturday, Global, 7 p.m.) is Global's current-affairs magazine show and this week it has a report on something that has been bothering a lot of us - the decline in the bee population. Apparently they are "dying by the tens of millions and humans may be the ones to blame." Correspondent Jackson Proskow examines why "many scientists are blaming a dangerous pesticide, and some say the company that makes the pesticide used faulty science to get it approved in Canada."
The fifth estate (Saturday, CBC NN, 8 p.m.) looks at another issue that should bother many of us - the real price of cheap garments. The report by Mark Kelley, called Made in Bangladesh, begins by noting that clothes bound for the Canadian market were in the rubble of Rana Plaza, which collapsed earlier this year. Some Canadian companies reacted with shock and surprise.
According to CBC, Kelley "tracked down workers who say they are still forced to make clothes for Canada in dangerous conditions.
And Kelley goes behind bars for an exclusive interview with the jailed owner of one of the biggest factories inside Rana Plaza, who details his long-standing, multimillion-dollar connections to Canada."
Gideon's Army (Sunday, CBC NN, 10 p.m. on The Passionate Eye ) is a Sundance winner directed and produced by Dawn Porter, which chronicles a group of young, idealistic lawyers in the Deep South of the United States who defend those who otherwise would not receive representation in court.
The picture painted is grim and helps explain why the U.S. prison population is so extraordinarily high.

In defence of glass towers

Full text:   While some warn against glass-walled structures, technological advances and imagination have led to some amazing designs
jmays@globeandmail.com
I like the shine, lift and futurism of numerous glazed residential towers that have dotted Toronto's downtown cityscape in recent years.
That's not saying all of these buildings measure up uniformly to high artistic standards. But it is saying that even the less imaginative ones often show what a beautiful, luxe and urbane material contemporary glass has become.
Nor, as I found out a couple of weeks ago, have developers run out of ways to apply glass solutions to the outfitting of high-rise buildings.
Take, for example, what is happening at Sixty Colborne, a glassy new inner-city condominium project by Peter Freed just east of Yonge Street. Four ample units stand at the corners of the complex, each with an area between about 1,000 square feet and 2,000 square feet. (Prices range from just under $705,000 to over $1.4-million.) The problem: At those prices, prospective home-owners would probably want a balcony, and none of the suites has one.
To remedy this lack, Mr. Freed is offering (for about $50,000 on top of the unit price) to modify the glass walls of the suite so they can be slid aside. The result, when the wall is fully open, will be a gap 16 feet wide and extending from floor to ceiling, which should transform a corner of the apartment into a balcony-like space.
This modest move - which I've not seen in high-rises elsewhere - will attractively blur the normally firm line between outside and inside, city and home. With Mr. Freed's innovation in place, house-owners can have the pleasure of a terrace (when they want one) without paying for a balcony they only use a few months of the year.
But despite the facts about its celebrity and versatility - manufacturers are churning out new products all the time, consumer demand for glazed apartments is high, developers and architects continue to come up with interesting things to do with it - glass has been attacked far and wide in recent years.
To cite just one local instance: CBC Toronto's popular Metro Morning website advises us that "building scientists have known for a long time that glass-walled structures are less energy efficient than the stone and concrete buildings that were put up forty or fifty years ago ... [I]ndustry insiders warn that as energy costs climb, glass towers may become the 'pariah' buildings of the future."
The same series of witheringly critical articles and broadcasts quotes high-profile researchers who have weighed in against the cladding of tall towers with glass. One of them is Ted Kesik, an engineer and professor of building science at the University of Toronto, who has separately published his findings and remarks on the Web. (His article can be easily located by Googling the author's name.)
The current real-estate boom, Mr. Kesik writes, has created a generation of towers wrapped in glass systems that will probably fail after only "15 to 20 years," and that are, from the outset, "thermally inefficient compared to curtain walls or punched windows." "There is no villain in this story," he says, but virtually everyone with any connection to the world of real estate - developers, manufacturers, architects, agents, consumers - has "collectively contributed to the present situation." Which, by Mr. Kesik's accounting, is or soon will be a bad situation indeed.
"Preposterous" was the word Peter Clewes used, when I asked him last week to characterize the apocalyptic scenarios sometimes forecast by the anti-glass faction. (Mr. Clewes is the architect of Sixty Colborne and nearly 20 other glass-clad towers in downtown Toronto.)
"Conventional double-glazed units," he said, "whether they are in punched windows in a fancy Rosedale house, or in a cheap, cheap condominium in Scarborough, have a life expectancy of between 35 and 40 years. After 40 years, the seal around the perimeter starts to break down, and you can get some moisture." Like a roof or floor, "glass has to be ultimately replaced. That has to be built into anyone's maintenance budget," he said.
Mr. Clewes attributes the durability of contemporary glazing systems to industry advances over the past few decades. "We built throwaway buildings in the fifties and sixties, with single-glazed sliding windows that leaked like a sieve. We know how to keep water out now. We have solved the big technical problems. What we are into now is refinement. How far do we want to take energy performance, for instance?"
The answer to that question will be determined by the tolerance and expectations of the marketplace. Mr. Clewes advocates high energy taxing as a proven way to encourage personal conservation and good public policies - and a much more effective way than preaching at people to be "greener."
"Once we stop the moral rhetoric, and start taxing energy," he said, "then we will quickly have a more sustainable city"

The condo still defines Toronto's skyline

Author: Ireland, Carolyn

Wandering around Chicago for a few days last week was a disconcerting experience for what I didn't see: The Windy City seemed strangely empty.
It took a few hours before it struck me that I've become so accustomed to the cranes, construction sites and condo towers in Toronto, the normal buzz of a large American metropolis seemed eerily quiet in comparison.
And when I looked at empty stretches of sky, 3-D renderings were popping into my head. It's an occupational hazard as a real estate reporter that, when walking past downtown building sites or along the shore of Lake Ontario, I can't help but visualize the completed structure, and what it will mean for the views of people in the surrounding towers.
I had no awareness of how consuming this diversion has become until I went to Chicago and had a nagging feeling that there was something I was supposed to be doing.
From the 28th floor of an older condo building with an expansive view over Lake Michigan and the shoreline, the only construction site I could see was an ugly pit in Millennium Park. They have torn out all of the trees and gardens surrounding Frank Gehry's curving bridge in order to build a children's playground. Many of the locals are distraught, but that's another story.
Looking along the lake's edge, I saw a vast expanse of trails and parkland. There are towers in downtown Chicago, to be sure, but many have been there for decades. Here, condo owners don't move in to find the view from their floor-to-ceiling windows blocked by another tower before they've even had a chance to mount the flat-screen TV.
In Chicago, Jeanne Gang's 82-story Aqua tower stands out for its wavy beauty and shiny newness. It was completed in 2009.
In Toronto's Humber Bay Shores, West Donlands, Citiplace and many other areas, the neighbourhood seems to undergo a transformation practically on a weekly basis. But despite all of the building still to come, buyer fatigue is showing up in the numbers.
In Ontario, housing starts declined 15.5 per cent in September from August - bucking the rising trend in most markets across the country.
Stefane Marion, chief economist and strategist at National Bank Financial, points out that starts for multiunits - those condo towers - in the Greater Toronto Area came in at their lowest level in five months. Since many buildings that are newly built or somewhere in the planning and construction phase have a good chunk of unsold units, Mr. Marion expects builders to be prudent about launching more projects.
Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, he expects a weak economy and rising mortgage rates will lead to softer housing starts in many Canadian cities. Since the strongest showing in the three months ended Sept. 30 came from condos, rather than single-family houses being built in the Prairies and Atlantic Canada, he says it's not clear that new construction will contribute to economic growth in the third quarter.
Capital Economics is forecasting a slump in Canada's housing market that will hold back economic growth over the next two years. The firm's economists point to a slowdown in construction and declining new-home sales. While existing home sales have perked up in the second half of 2013 compared with the first, the economists suspect that buyers are closing deals quickly to take advantage of lower preapproved mortgage rates. If they are correct, they warn, next year's existing home sales will be even weaker than they otherwise would have been.

Full text:   When the Dallas Stars were floundering, Tom Gaglardi saw their potential and bought them. The overhaul is well under way, thanks to the Canadian owner who turned to some of the sharper minds in hockey to help the team and the bottom line
In the sprawled suburbs north of Dallas, several dozen women and men in their 20s work the phones, selling hockey tickets in Texas. The headquarters of the Dallas Stars buzzes, voices making pitches, trying to fill seats that in recent years often went empty.
This used to be easier work. The Stars, a dozen years ago, were a big-time team in the city, winning a Stanley Cup and selling out 238 consecutive games. It's not easy work any more - but there is renewed vigour.
The Stars are reaching for a renaissance - under Canadian guidance. The worst stretch of the NHL club's history came two years ago, in the final months of bankruptcy, when attendance guttered at 6,306, the American Airlines Center two-thirds empty. Through the fiscal ordeal, the team bled, and booked losses of more than $100-million (U.S.).
The man who saw value in the financial wreckage is Tom Gaglardi.
Based in Vancouver, the billionaire Gaglardi family has deep roots in British Columbia, where Tom's grandfather was a provincial government minister and his father started the family's Northland Properties Corp., hotels (Sandman) and restaurants (Moxie's, Denny's) business.
Tom Gaglardi has led the expansion of the company and, a decade ago, tried but failed to buy the Vancouver Canucks. When the Stars deal emerged, it was a fit. Gaglardi's mother grew up in small city east of Dallas.
The overhaul is under way, even as results arrive in staccato fashion. The NHL team last winter let a shot at the playoffs slip away, missing the postseason for the fifth consecutive year. The pace of remaking and reviving then intensified.
In the off-season - putting in pillars Gaglardi believes can form a Detroit Red Wings-like foundation - the team hired Jim Nill as general manager. Nill hired former Buffalo Sabres stalwart Lindy Ruff as head coach, and traded for young star Tyler Seguin. The Stars also enjoy a shift to the time-zone appropriate Central Division from their last ill-fitting home in the Pacific.
"I like where we sit," Gaglardi said this week. "The business of the Dallas Stars dug quite a hole. We're well on our way to getting it fixed."
Fans have responded. Attendance jumped 20 per cent last year from the terrible 2011-12 season. The team has the equivalent of 7,000 season-ticket holders, up from 6,000 in early 2013.
There were fewer than 5,000 season-ticket holders when Gaglardi arrived.
The Stars' first two home games did not sell out but merchandise sales each night, buoyed by new jerseys, were $100,000-plus. Much of the rest of October will be on the road, starting Friday in Winnipeg.
The skeleton and innards of the franchise are rehabilitated. Results on the ice are what propels the enterprise now.
"Dallas loves winners," said Mark Masinter, a major commercial real estate broker who is among a group of locals advising Gaglardi. "Losing does not sit well in Dallas."
Bellwether for NHL
On a wall in the team's practice facility is written: "Details build empires." This is precisely the thinking of a key non-hockey guy in the office, Jason Farris, the team's chief operating officer.
Obsessed by hockey as a hobby, Farris had previously worked as an executive in banking and technology, until Gaglardi, a long-time friend from high school, called.
Farris has helped pilot the post-bankruptcy Stars. He negotiated a new debt deal, buying out three dozen old lenders and bringing in Bank of America to lead a new group of four banks. Other changes include new systems to make sure the club is making all the money it can, right down to where to most profitably position the children's merchandise kiosks at the arena.
A richer television deal is near-ready, and would kick in next season. The Stars make some $12-million a year from their current Fox Sports contract, a figure that is set eclipse $20-million, similar to an increase the network handed the Los Angeles Kings.
The success of such efforts will be a bellwether for the business of the NHL in the southern United States. After bailing out of Atlanta, and finally finding new owners for clubs in Florida and Phoenix, the league needs success in a city such as Dallas, one of the largest metropolitan areas in the country and, early last decade, one of the NHL's best markets.
The economy in Dallas is there. The city did not suffer a housing crash - prices fell less than 10 per cent - and employment has climbed, as people and businesses, lured by low taxes, flock here.
"The market's phenomenal," Farris said. "The market didn't go away. The Stars kind of went away. Just weren't relevant. That was our doing, not the market. The community is there, and waiting, and ever bigger."
Money flows
Gaglardi, before the changes last summer, initially reached into the past. He hired several people who made the team what it was in its best days. The first gambit was to reinstall Jim Lites as club president and other hires included Mike Modano, the long-time Stars captain/local hero, as a face of the franchise.
Gaglardi extended welcome to big business names in Dallas, creating an ownership-advisory group of some of the city's prominent business people to help spread the word, such as Masinter, as well as the chief executive officer of 7-Eleven Inc., Joe DePinto. That connection has helped the Stars sell some discount tickets to families to repopulate the stands and stoke long-term interest.
Money flows, too. The front office, emaciated through bankruptcy, has been restaffed, and on the ice the Stars are spending close to the salary cap.
The first time Lites arrived in Dallas to run the Stars he came from the Red Wings after the North Stars moved south from Minnesota in 1993. He departed in 2007, before the team began to flounder. The bankruptcy was part of a bigger bust for previous owner Tom Hicks, a leveraged-buyout investor who also owned baseball's Texas Rangers and carried too much debt into the global financial crisis.
In Lites's office, adjacent to the several dozen salespeople marketing hockey tickets, and overlooking the Stars' practice rink, there are framed pictures from the team's first game in Dallas. Back then, Lites saw a buoyant, affluent market but he didn't know whether the sport would sell in a city and a state that knew football and nothing of ice. When Lites returned, convinced to take the helm again by Gaglardi, he wasn't sure at first it would work, with the sparse crowds, terrible TV ratings, indifferent advertisers.
"I was really nervous when I came back," Lites said. "But if you ask me now, what do I think? I think we're going to be good. I really do."
The Stars missed the postseason in each of the first two years under Gaglardi and Lites - so Lites has brought more change, and more Detroit. The hiring of Nill - who replaced Joe Nieuwendyk as GM - adds a deep Detroit vein, as Nill, 55, was assistant GM of the Wings for 15 years. Nill then brought in Joe McDonnell, the long-time chief of amateur scouting in Detroit, a position he now holds in Dallas.
As Gaglardi hired Lites, Lites has marketed Gaglardi. Lites pushed the reluctant owner into the spotlight in a city where sports owners are typically iconoclasts, like Jerry Jones and his Dallas Cowboys, or Mark Cuban and the Dallas Mavericks.
"If you're owned by banks and creditors, nobody gives a crap," Lites said. "People invest their money and their time and their emotion in teams they believe in."
'Somewhat fearless'
Suite 1104 at the American Airlines Center is the domain of the ownership-advisory group. At a game last winter, Lites was there, intently watching his team on the ice. Don Carty, former chairman of American Airlines Inc., was also dropped by. Brett Hull, a star of the Stanley Cup-winning Stars, was visiting.
The real-estate broker Masinter came to the arena from the airport after returning from a business trip. Among the clients of Masinter's Open Realty Advisors is Apple Inc., for which Masinter helped the tech company open its retail stores. Gaglardi has attracted blue-chip people.
Making money comes down to winning. Five years ago, when the Rangers weren't winning, their ballpark was half-empty. Now the team has the fifth-highest attendance in baseball. Cuban produced an NBA winner in the Mavericks and the basketball team has been a top draw for a decade.
"Tom is a can-do guy," Masinter said of Gaglardi. "You have to be somewhat fearless to come in and make a significant investment in the NHL."
In the throes of bankruptcy, Gaglardi paid $267-million for the Stars and half of the American Airlines Center. A bargain, perhaps, but the losses were enormous.
"A guy said, 'You got a deal,'" Gaglardi said. "I was like, 'No, I just paid too much, that's why I got it.' But did I pay too much? Ask me in five or 10 years.
"Frankly, if we get this thing fixed, you're going to look back and say, 'Wow, you bought that franchise and half of that building for that, that's a hell of a deal.'"

Full text:   As 9,000 tickets to tour the prison sell out within hours, Friends of the Penitentiary Museum see a new future for 'Alcatraz North'
As the last few inmates were transferred from the recently closed Kingston Penitentiary, former warden Monty Bourke had mixed emotions. While he laments the closure of his long-time workplace - an institution that "touches all corners of Canadian history" - he's also brimming with excitement.
Mr. Bourke envisions a new future for the property, 12 acres that sit prominently on the shores of Lake Ontario, on valuable waterfront real estate just minutes from the city's downtown core.
Mr. Bourke, now retired after a career that included a five-year stint at Kingston Pen's helm, is best known these days as president of Friends of the Penitentiary Museum, a non-profit group that manages the Correctional Service of Canada Museum.
The museum is one of Kingston's most popular attractions, second only to Fort Henry. Situated in a former warden's residence across the street from the prison, it's home to an impressive collection of memorabilia - uniforms, archaic punishment devices, confiscated weapons and the like.
"I'm stepping out on a limb," Mr. Bourke says, "but I think it's the largest collection in the world." The collection is so big that the Victorian house can display only a fraction of it. Mr. Bourke's group wants to expand the museum to incorporate the vacant prison.
Converting an old prison into a museum is hardly a new idea. It's been done, most famously at Alcatraz near San Francisco. Some have even taken to calling the Friends' proposal "Alcatraz North." Mr. Bourke, however, prefers to draw his inspiration from further away. The Melbourne Gaol, a decommissioned Australian prison and Kingston Pen lookalike, closed in 1929 and reopened in 1973. Most of the property is owned by the Melbourne Institute of Technology and the Australian government. However the prison's entrance and the cell block are now a museum.
What impresses Mr. Bourke is how the museum makes the most of its small space. "They have almost no artifacts," he says, "so they focus on the experience." Visitors are tried and convicted at the nearby courthouse, then processed as offenders and locked in a cell where they learn about the prison's history through holographic exhibits.
"The point is to preserve history," Mr. Bourke says, "to tell what it was like, both the humanity and the inhumanity." The experiential model has proven effective at telling that story in Melbourne and in other prison museums Mr. Bourke has visited. He believes it's the key to attracting visitors. "People don't want to look at static displays and plaques any more," he says. "They want to play and be engaged."
An experiential museum would likely find a receptive audience in Kingston, Mr. Bourke says, because its history is so intertwined with the city's. He estimates that eight generations of Kingstonians have worked at the prison since it opened in 1835. And its prominent location has made it a curiosity among those without a direct connection.
Some numbers support Mr. Bourke's optimism. When the British Columbia Penitentiary closed in 1980, it drew approximately 80,000 visitors in one week. Forty years after opening as a museum, the Melbourne Gaol still averages 176,000 annual visitors, and Alcatraz, which also opened in 1973 as a museum, draws 1.3 million annually.
Those who think Kingstonians are above such touristy behaviour need only look at this month's United Way fundraiser. After the inmates were transferred but before the doors closed for good, Corrections Canada agreed to open the prison to the public and turn proceeds over to the charity - 9,000 tickets sold out in a couple of hours.
"It was an eye-opener," says Lisa Ray, a local radio announcer and lifelong Kingstonian, who toured the premises last week. "The penitentiary is such a big piece of our identity, yet unless you worked there, you'd never know what went on inside those walls. It would be a shame not to expand the museum there."
Corrections Canada "has yet to make a decision" about what to do with the property, says senior spokeswoman Christa McGregor. The lengthy decommissioning process has just begun, and will likely continue until sometime in 2015. The final decision will have to wait at least that long.
Of course that hasn't stopped local groups from making plans. Those who are keeping an eye on the situation believe that Corrections essentially has three options: Keep the property and repurpose it; sell it to another government agency; or divest outright. Mr. Bourke says the Friends hope to be involved no matter which option Corrections pursues. Their current leasing agreement is in effect until 2018. If Corrections retains the property, Mr. Bourke is confident they can extend the deal to include the prison. If they sell, he hopes to retain the current agreement with the museum and negotiate a new one with the prison's new owners.
But would a new owner be receptive? Martin Skolnick, a commercial realtor and broker with DTZ Eastern Ontario Ltd., says it's certainly possible. "This isn't a typical waterfront property," he says. "The penitentiary would be a stumbling block for a developer who might be interested in building residential units."
The problem is that the prison is a national historic site and many of the buildings are functionally obsolete, making renovation both costly and complicated. Still, Mr. Skolnick sees an opportunity for a mixed-use development that could include a recently proposed international training centre for sailors and - possibly - new space for the museum. "It's an opportunity to do something world class," he says.
Now all eyes are on Corrections Canada. While the Friends continue to explore their options, Mr. Bourke hopes that he can step through Kingston Pen's doors again, not as its warden, but as a visitor to Kingston's most eagerly awaited tourist attraction.

Full text:   North Toronto takes issue with British architect Will Alsop's plan for a new residential development
jmays@globeandmail.com
Will Alsop once told an interviewer: "Being an architect is to some extent a performing art, because you've got to keep people up, you've got to keep the whole situation buoyant. ... I've noticed that the best and most successful projects are when everyone just keeps smiling."
Judged by that measure, the British designer's latest Toronto venture, called Alaska, is definitely shaky. (It's a co-production by Mr. Alsop and Toronto's Quadrangle Architects.)
Unsmiling residents in Yonge Street districts between Eglinton Avenue and Lawrence Avenue have dotted their lawns with signs that ask, "Why Alaska?" and call for the 130-unit residential development to be squashed. Leaders in the local citizens' group (the Uptown Yonge Neighbourhood Alliance) were surely not smiling when they pinned up their well-researched objections on the organization's website.
For my own part, I had to smile when I saw the renderings of what Mr. Alsop has in mind for the corner of Yonge Street and Strathgowan Avenue. Alaska, after all, is exactly the kind of design I would have expected this perennial outsider to propose for a site in staid, conventional North Toronto.
It has a pugnaciously eccentric podium composed of six storeys that curve inward as they rise, giving this feature the wide-bottomed profile of a Victorian greenhouse or a Quonset hut. The seventh storey is a short waist between the podium and a three-storey glass-clad slab that is smartly cantilevered out toward Yonge Street. The lower part of the building is to be draped with lacy metal netting. It is all very white, which further sets it apart from the brown brick facades of single-family homes round about.
In fact, the building makes no polite bows at all toward its sedate architectural context. Like OCAD University's Sharp Centre for Design in Toronto, and like other punchily poetic works Mr. Alsop has recently done in Britain, Alaska (if built out as proposed) will be brusquely indifferent to the virtues (much admired in these parts) of fitting in. It will draw its attitude and artistic energies from the new city of commotion, surprise and high density, and argue against what's routine and traditional about Toronto's urban culture. One thing it won't be: dull.
We wouldn't want outspoken architecture of this sort at every intersection. Every new building does not need to make an exuberant fuss about itself (as Alaska well may) or express a cutting-edge creative sensibility. But Alaska might just work well in the spot it has been designed for, as a starkly dramatic contrast to all that surrounds it. The structure could freshen up the old, rather tired streetscape, like a brand-new tie worn with last year's suit.
Now I'll wipe the grin off my face and deal with one of the non-aesthetic questions that will, or already have, come up during the city's official approvals process.
One that I take seriously has to do with the demolitions necessary to clear the ground for Alaska. In all, four older buildings will have to go. None is a treasure, but three of them contain a total of 28 units of rental housing. As everyone knows, Toronto's real-estate industry has not been investing in new rental apartments over the last several years. This situation could change in the near future. But even if it does, the city will still need to hold on to every rental property it has.
True, a planning staff report issued last spring indicates that developer Bianca Pollock will make 28 of Alaska's 130 suites rentals. But that's just one-for-one replacement of what will be lost. If the citizens of North Toronto want to mount a crusade, they might try to persuade Ms. Pollock to build in even more rental units.
Such an effort might have a desirable social outcome, whereas their campaign against Alaska's anti-contextual art will do nothing more than get in the way of an interesting experiment.
Unless, of course, the city, for its own reasons, stops it first. According to the neighbourhood group's website - and their contentions appear to be correct - Alaska would break every rule in the city's official bible. It's too tall. It doesn't step back from the street properly. Above all, it's rude - and the Official Plan specifically forbids new developments to be rude.
I understand the need for enforceable municipal regulation - without it, the people next door would be raising chickens - but I draw the line when it begins to frustrate invention and curiosity.
So what if Alaska turns out to be irresponsible? We'll survive. What we won't survive is timidity and mediocrity of civic imagination. Toronto needs this project, just to find out if we are still capable of thinking boldly about our urban fabric.
Why Alaska? That's why.

Abstract: "People are talking about whether the market's had a hard landing or a soft landing, but so far there's no landing whatsoever," said Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce economist Benjamin Tal. "My sense is that activity is too strong for the liking of regulators, and maybe the government. The market is stronger than it should be at this stage of the cycle."

Full text:   Canada's housing market already topped what economists expected for the spring and summer, and could do it again this fall.
Local real estate boards are beginning to release September's data, and the numbers so far are strong. Toronto, Calgary and Vancouver are all reporting solid year-over-year increases.
"People are talking about whether the market's had a hard landing or a soft landing, but so far there's no landing whatsoever," said Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce economist Benjamin Tal. "My sense is that activity is too strong for the liking of regulators, and maybe the government. The market is stronger than it should be at this stage of the cycle."
He suspects that some of the strength still stems from prospective homebuyers deciding to jump into the market now to lock in low mortgage rates before they rise further. "Part of what we're seeing now is people stealing activity from the future, out of fear of higher interest rates."
The Toronto Real Estate Board said Thursday that the 7,411 homes that sold in the GTA over the Multiple Listing Service during September was 30 per cent higher than in September of 2012.
"We expect to see sales up for the remainder of 2013, as the pent-up demand that resulted from stricter mortgage lending guidelines continues to be satisfied," said Toronto Real Estate Board president Dianne Usher.
The market is still recovering from a slump. The number of homes that have sold in the Toronto area so far this year remains about 1 per cent lower than during the same period in 2012.
The MLS Home Price Index for the city was up 4 per cent year-over year, and the Toronto Real Estate Board said the annual rate of growth in prices has been accelerating since the spring. That's being driven by detached homes. Detached homes in the downtown 416 area code saw prices rise 10.2 per cent last month from a year earlier, while condo prices were down by 3.7 per cent.
Calgary's local real estate board said September sales came in 19 per cent higher than a year earlier, and 14 per cent above the long-term average for that month. The board added the momentum of July and August seems to have waned a bit as the short-term impact of the floods has passed.
"Nonetheless, sales growth remains strong, in part because net migration has been stronger than anticipated and rental product is in short supply," Ann-Marie Lurie, chief economist for the Calgary Real Estate Board, stated in a press release.
"While prices show strong year-over-year gains, if the level of new listings continues to improve relative to sales activity, prices should level off for the remainder of the year," she added. Prices were up more than 7 per cent on a year-over-year basis.
Vancouver's real estate board reported a 63.8 per cent increase in September sales, compared to a year earlier.
But it's important to note that sales at this time last year were sinking across the country, in the wake of Finance Minister Jim Flaherty's decision to tighten mortgage insurance rules in July 2012.
Despite Vancouver's rise, its September showing remains 1 per cent below the 10-year average sales level for September.
The MLS Home Price Index benchmark price for all types of residential properties in Greater Vancouver stood at $601,900 in September, down 0.7 per cent from a year earlier but up 2.3 per cent from the start of the year.

Full text:   The marketer's campaign for the ultra-luxury high-rise starts with a Learjet and a Rolls-Royce
The taste of Veuve Clicquot in the morning can be a heady experience.
Especially for members of the Vancouver press corps who were escorted to the airport earlier this week in a new, chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce Ghost and whisked away for a 40-minute flight on a Learjet to get a bird's eye view of the site of the new Trump International Hotel & Tower.
The Holborn Group, developers of the $360-million Arthur Erickson designed twisting tower that goes to market in October, were anxious to give journalists a taste of the champagne lifestyle they say awaits buyers.
Holborn is partnering with London Air Services and Rolls-Royce; residents of the 218 suites will share access to the Rolls with guests in the 147 hotel rooms, and will receive flight hours based on the purchase price of each unit.
Other amenities include a champagne lounge, poolside bar, signature restaurant and Ivanka Trump-brand spa.
"But are there enough rich people in Vancouver to make this viable?" asked one champagne-fuelled reporter of Holborn chief executive Joo Kim Tiah.
"We have three times as many registrations as units," he replied, "and that's just in the local market."

Full text:   Las Vegas-based Paragon Development has unveiled a new proposal for a $535-million "urban resort" to replace a project that foundered when Vancouver city council rejected plans for a destination casino at the heart of the complex.
Paragon officials said the new proposal reflected feedback from city officials and would be markedly different from the company's previous concept.
"When the city council approved our relocation back in 2011, we listened very carefully to the questions, concerns and suggestions that they laid down," Paragon president Scott Menke said at a briefing in Vancouver. "We needed to do that, because we needed to get it right. ... The urban resort concept is very different than the casino resorts that many people think of, especially the ones in Las Vegas."
The plan announced on Tuesday includes space for Paragon's Edgewater Casino - currently next to False Creek at a site slated for redevelopment - as well as two hotels, a conference centre and restaurants.
A group that spearheaded opposition to Paragon's previous proposal was quick to wave warning flags about the new plan, citing a lack of transparency and financial concerns.
"This is a terrible deal for both the city of Vancouver and the province of B.C.," Sandy Garossino, spokeswoman for Vancouver Not Vegas, said on Tuesday in a statement. "If Edgewater cannot expand its slot machines and gaming tables, it's a business certainty that revenues to the province and the city will fall, because Edgewater's expenses are about to rise precipitously."
Paragon's previous plan called for expanding the Edgewater casino from 600 slot machines and 75 gaming tables to as many as 1,500 slot machines and 150 gaming tables. After a public backlash, city council in April, 2011, approved rezoning the site, but rejected the expanded casino.
Paragon's revised proposal is subject to regulatory approval by the city.
Under the plan, a relocated casino, hotels and restaurants are supposed to blend into a neighbourhood that includes B.C. Place and Rogers Arena, and residential towers.
Paragon's partners include Toronto-based Dundee Corp. and 360 Vox, a real estate development company whose biggest shareholder is Dundee.
According to an economic impact assessment commissioned by Paragon, the project would create about 2,000 jobs and generate $180-million a year for the local economy, as well as annual spin-off spending of $87-million.
The project would be built on land owned by B.C. Pavilion Corp., a Crown corporation that plans to offset the costs of its more than $500-million recent renovation of B.C. Place - including a new roof - with lease revenues from Paragon.
Paragon and PavCo have signed a proposed ground lease that calls for a 70-year term and rent of $3-million a year.
Asked if the design would allow the casino to be expanded later, Paragon president Scott Menke said the company is "not contemplating that right now."

Full text:   With stable ownership situation, team is set to change name to Arizona Coyotes to boost presence throughout U.S. state
eduhatschek@globeandmail.com
In July of 2009, or long before he ever thought about investing in the money-losing Phoenix Coyotes, George Gosbee was appointed to the board of Chrysler Group LLC, to oversee the federal and Ontario governments' investment in the bankrupt company.
It was the height of the financial crisis and things could not have looked any worse for Chrysler's survival. The challenge, according to Gosbee, was significant.
"How do you come up with a marketing campaign for a company that might not have made the best cars, had laid off thousands and thousands of employees, and was owned by taxpayers now? How do you come up with a campaign that says, 'Buy our cars?'" he says. "We came up with up the 'imported from Detroit ad' - about how hard the employees worked at Chrysler. I wanted that type of message here - how hard the team had worked to overcome adversity."
By here, Gosbee meant the Coyotes, the NHL team he and a group of investors purchased out of bankruptcy in July, ending an ownership soap opera that rivalled Days of Our Lives for twists and turns. In early September, the rebranding of the Coyotes began in earnest, with a one-minute ad broadcast on the videoboard at the home opener of the NFL's Arizona Cardinals.
It featured team captain Shane Doan staring into the camera, while a narrator extolled the virtues of a team that far exceeded expectations in the years when general manager Don Maloney had to run the team on a shoe-string budget.
"It was not a typical sports marketing message," Gosbee says. "It was about bringing in the collective resources of the ownership group and giving a better message: That we're here to stay; we understand hockey; we understand what it takes on and off the ice."
Gosbee is president and chief executive officer of Calgary-based AltaCorp Capital Inc. and so, on Wednesday, he will be sitting in his own private box at the Scotiabank Saddledome - right across from where the local owners sit - as the Coyotes play the Flames in an exhibition game.
On some level, it will represent the culmination of a dream he says began in sixth grade, the year the Flames moved to Alberta from Atlanta. Virtually from that moment on, he had it in his mind that one day, he wanted to own an NHL team.
"The Flames came at the same time I had a math teacher explain the stock market to us," Gosbee says. "I remember running home to my mom and saying, 'Mom, do you know about this stock market?'
"I just became infatuated with the stock market - because of the numbers; and the management side of it. I was always a sports nut. I'm a live-sport junkie. So to me, the two things kind of coincided were the two things I love - sports and finance."
Once upon a time, Phoenix was a decent hockey town. According to Gosbee, knowing the team now has stable ownership will go a long way to winning over the local business community.
"What corporate sponsor would come in and sign a three-year deal when they knew the team could be gone?" he says. "So those things are starting to change."
But operating a sports team is a little like buying real estate - sometimes, it all about location, location, location.
Part of the problem is that Phoenix is so spread out geographically, the drive to Glendale (where the Coyotes arena is) from Scottsdale or any place else on the east side of town, on a weeknight, facing all the traffic, can be nightmarish. The fan experience is terrific once you get there - a small village of restaurants and bars service patrons before and after games, a modern up-to-date building - but the logistics of getting to games remain problematic.
"We're exploring a lot of different things - transportation on our own, transportation with the city, transportation with restaurants," he says. "We're exploring different start times. We are exploring all that, but we're never going to make up for the distance."
As part of trying to increase its presence throughout the state, the team will be known as the Arizona Coyotes next season.
For now though, in the giddy early days of ownership, the challenge will be to leave the hockey operations in the hands of Maloney and head coach Dave Tippett and not fret about exhibition-game losses.
Gosbee says he understands enough about hockey culture to do just that: "That's the message of our group. We want to focus in on the non-hockey stuff - and just enjoy the hockey."

At Macquarie, it's back to the future

Abstract: Between buying Orion and giving Orion staff the reins, Macquarie took a long and expensive detour. Macquarie quickly ramped up its ambitions. It bought Calgary-based Tristone Capital for $145-million in 2008 and paid $93-million for Blackmont Capital that same year. The speedy build hadn't been the plan, Paul Donnelly, the man imported from Australia to run Canada, said at the time. The opportunities just arose.

Full text:   berman@globeandmail.com
Macquarie Group Ltd. spent six years trying to find a niche between Canada's big banks and its boutique brokerages. What the Australian financial firm found instead is that is a good way to get squeezed.
After six pricey years of experimenting, Macquarie Group is giving up on fighting the country's big banks. But it's not giving up on Canada, instead going back to a boutique approach.
The quick and not entirely orderly retreat of Macquarie from some of its expensively built positions in Canadian finance has raised questions about whether the bank has decided to pull out altogether. Those include decisions in recent weeks to shrink investment banking, to sell a wealth management network years in the making, and the announcement Friday that the man hired to run Macquarie in Canada would be leaving.
The tendency of foreign firms that appear when Canada is hot only to pull back when it is not is long established. The fact that Macquarie has spent something close to half a billion dollars building in Canada over the past six years does little to dampen talk that the next step is a full in retreat. The reality is Canada is a small market that is nice to have in good times and expendable in bad times.
Stifel Nicolaus of the U.S. abruptly closed its underperforming local operation last month.
Given that backdrop, the questions are hardly surprising. It appears that the answer in Macquarie's case is different. The big moves of recent weeks are the end, not the beginning, of a major shift.
Rather than return to Australia, people close to the situation say Macquarie will instead return its Canadian operations to what they were six years ago - a local boutique dealer with a big global bank behind it. That was what Macquarie created in 2007 when it bought Canadian boutique Orion Securities. That $147-million acquisition took Macquarie into capital markets in Canada with a set of strong bankers and traders largely focused on resources. At least, that was the hope from the Orion side. Now, two of the Orion partners are in charge, with oil and gas banker Dan Cristall becoming chief executive and sales and trading head Alex Rothwell becoming president.
Between buying Orion and giving Orion staff the reins, Macquarie took a long and expensive detour. Macquarie quickly ramped up its ambitions. It bought Calgary-based Tristone Capital for $145-million in 2008 and paid $93-million for Blackmont Capital that same year. The speedy build hadn't been the plan, Paul Donnelly, the man imported from Australia to run Canada, said at the time. The opportunities just arose. The belief was Macquarie could cobble together a business that reflected what worked in other markets - "mirroring Macquarie's global specialist capabilities," as the firm put it when it announced Mr. Donnelly's departure in early 2011.
Macquarie also hired aggressively, adding analysts and brokers and bankers. It tried to fight Canada's big banks for bond deals. There was talk of a banking licence. But a lot of the operation struggled to make money.
Mr. Donnelly's replacement, Dave Fleck, had to try to make it all work and, what's more, to do it in a down market. Macquarie learned lesson one of Canada with Mr. Donnelly, that importing a boss is dangerous because the Canadian capital markets may look a lot like any other, but they have their own quirks. There is a reason that big successful foreign firms in Canada are often run by Canadians (top of the list would be Merrill Lynch).
Mr. Fleck brought a local perspective, having had a long career most notably at the investment banking operations of Bank of Montreal.
But what he got to work with was problematic. Spending big to get a top pipeline analyst was not enough to get a big chunk of pipeline share underwriting business. The big banks lend to the pipelines, and unless Macquarie could do the same it would not be able to compete. The retail brokerage business was said to be losing millions a year.
What Macquarie had built wasn't entirely clear, as Mr. Fleck acknowledged.
"The biggest challenge for us is to truly understand what we're good at, and what we're not so good at," he told the Globe not long before his departure was announced.
Now, what remains is largely what came in the Orion purchase, with a few add-ons. From Tristone, there's added energy research capability. From the hiring push, there are analysts covering areas such as telecom, banking and real estate.
Macquarie is never going to be big in investment banking in telecom and financial services. But the analysts generate votes from big money managers that turn into commission dollars.
In real estate, where Macquarie had some success, the firm appears to be betting that its real estate analyst, Michael Smith, is popular enough with companies he covers to generate some underwriting business on his own. So look for Macquarie to remain in syndicates for offerings in real estate So what is left is a mining- and energy-focused boutique with a business trading yield stocks. Seeing Macquarie expand into other areas of coverage would not be a big surprise.
But the days of trying to fly closer to the banks are likely over. It's now the boutique path.
To be sure that comes with its own challenges. Many boutiques focused on resources are struggling.
There is always the possibility if Canada's market stays quiet that the head office in Australia may yet make a call to pull out fully.
For now it seems Macquarie, having learned a lesson, plans to stay and try a new model that looks a lot like the old model.

LISTING AGENT
Nicolas Blachette, Sutton Group West Coast
What They Got: The unit, inside the glass and concrete Milano tower, has 180-degree views of the Northshore mountains, English Bay and False Creek.
* The nearly 700-square-foot interior was designed by famous local designer Robert Ledingham, with granite counters, glass breakfast bar, gas fireplace, porcelain tile, laminate floors and floor-to-ceiling windows.
* The Milano is close to the sea wall, Stanley Park, shops at Davie and Granville streets, and is in one of Vancouver's rapidly changing neighbourhoods, the West End. It's on the fringe of Yaletown, too, so it's got direct access to the shops and high-end restaurants in that former warehouse neighbourhood.
The Action: Downtown Vancouver, with a population of around 80,000, is changing fast, with plans for increased density in the next two years. There are several condo projects, such as Maddox, Salt, The Rolston, The Mark and 999 Seymour, that will add approximately 1,000 new homes. And more projects slated to follow.
The Agent's Take: "This unit sold fast because it is a very unique architectural home," says listing agent Nicolas Blachette. "We had a couple of showings within the first few days, and the right buyer showed up and purchased it. They are retirees and intend to live there as their primary home.
"There are many one-bedroom units available downtown, but when you are looking for one with views, 15 to 30 floors and higher, they become rare, especially under $450,000," he adds. "Any home well priced at market value will end up selling fast, and homes overpriced are still attracting lots of showings, but they usually end up with a price reduction over time or not selling."

Full text:   Turning underused basement space into a family-friendly zone can often make more sense than building an addition
srichardson@globeandmail.com
If you're looking for a house to buy or have recently bought one, you're likely all too aware of how far your dollar goes (or doesn't go) in the current real estate market. It would be fabulous if your budget got you the house of your dreams, complete with all the bells and whistles, in move-in condition, but that's not reality for most home buyers. Cash-strapped as most buyers are, you'll need to invest your renovation dollars to get the most impact and the best return on your investment. And with a hefty price per square foot, you'll need to make the most of every square inch of your new abode. So let's talk basements.
Make the most of what you've got
Many of my clients itching for more space think first of building an addition. But it's not always necessary to add on space when usable space already exists underfoot. Basement space is essentially free, since you already own it, and if you have a high and dry basement, it's worth investing in. Getting past seeing your basement as a subterranean zone worthy only of storage and laundry is key to maximizing your square footage and living large.
Open up and say ahhhh
Establishing the scope and square footage of any project is an important starting point. Since the rest of your house sits on the foundation of your basement, you could require some structural modifications to create the open areas you desire. You may be tempted to cut corners and do a quick and cheap "tart job" in your basement, but I would recommend spending money on an engineer and having proper drawings approved if any significant changes are being made. Not every basement is dry, and ensuring you have the proper waterproofing and insulation in place before adding finishing touches should be a top priority. To create the vast open space in this room, we removed almost 20 feet of concrete block and replaced it with a recessed steel beam. It cost a few thousand dollars, but the end result was worth every penny.
Divide and conquer
Once you've committed to tackling the basement and turning it into a family-friendly zone, you need to establish the overall footprint you'll be working with. Finishing your basement will take away some storage, so be sure to leave as much room for the ugly realities of life that you actually need in order to avoid having your new living area become a dumping zone (boxes, tools and Christmas decorations are not the finishing touch to your newly renovated room).
Prepare for wear and tear
Since we live in a climate that is guaranteed to deliver months of cold weather every year, there needs to be a place at home where kids can be kids and, as Maurice Sendak wrote, "let the wild rumpus start." How is that possible in a room as nice as this? Well, instead of putting drywall all the way to the floor, you might want to consider a more durable option. The panelling on these walls cost less than $20 per 4-by-8-foot sheet and is a composite fibreboard with a rustic, rough-sawn wood texture. I'm generally not a fan of anything "faux" but once installed and painted, it looks great (and is more resistant to mini hockey pucks than standard issue drywall ... especially since the paint has a scrubbable finish).
Get cozy
If you think your basement is the last place you'd ever choose to spend time hanging out as a family, watching movies and chilling out, it likely has a lot to do with your insulation and flooring. Just because your basement is below grade should not mean you feel as if you're six feet under. Thanks to a thermal imaging camera, we found out the existing insulation in this basement was not up to par, so we installed spray foam insulation to raise the R-value. To make the floors extra durable and toasty, we installed heated floor mats beneath inexpensive honed Brazilian slate floors. Wall-to-wall carpeting is a cheaper alternative, but it will be prone to stains and will show the wear and tear over time. If you are taking a long view at your renovation, you may decide that it's worth springing for heated tile or stone. And you don't need to go without the creature comforts of plush textures; just pick up an inexpensive patterned carpet to use as an area rug. It's an easy way to add colour and pattern to the neutral foundation of your room.
And keep it cool
Basements aren't generally overwhelmingly bright, so the natural reaction is to paint the room a light, bright colour to make it appear more cheery and happy. But before you order up a few gallons of sunny pale yellow paint, I'd encourage you to think about how and when you will really use your basement room. What are your living patterns? If it's a nighttime room, why not dress in a cool, nightshade palette that creates a moody evening atmosphere? Silvery greys and smoky blues accented with rich chocolatey woods and durable leather allow you to tread the line between man cave and media room.
Prepare to serve
If you don't want to put your movie on hold while you dash upstairs for refreshments and snacks, consider installing a little servery in your basement. If you've visited the concession stand at your local movie theatre lately, you know that it can quickly drain your wallet, but a bar fridge and microwave are inexpensive indulgences that can be integrated with a couple of cabinets to hold barware and dishes.
Your home theatre can offer all the indulgences without the lineup!
Keep it under wraps
If you are installing a wall-mounted TV, you'll want to plan ahead for the placement of your audiovisual components so the wiring can be completely hidden. I like to have a pair of cabinets installed flanking a fireplace to reinforce symmetry. Deep cabinets that can accommodate the depth of A/V components also offer great storage options for board games and kids toys, and ample storage ensures you won't be overrun with mess and mayhem. I opted to install inexpensive base cabinets and topped them with butcher block to add some rustic texture to the room, while keeping an eye on the bottom line.
Make a reservation
Not every basement has room to spare, but if the layout allows, I love to add a table and chairs to the mix. The reality is many of us enjoy "dinner and a movie" and might have the occasional meal while we are tuned in. Instead of trying to balance a plate on your lap, why not plan for a table so you can eat while watching the feature bill? As a bonus, the table is a great spot to spread out craft projects, jigsaw puzzles, or board games.

Abstract: At a downtown dinner party the other night, the talk turned to that favourite Toronto topic: real estate prices. All three couples at the table bought their houses about 20 years back. Since then, prices in our gentrifying west-end neighbourhood have soared. Semi-detached Victorians that went for $200,000 or so in the early 1990s now fetch four or five times that. "We're all millionaires!" one neighbour said. On paper, anyway.

At a downtown dinner party the other night, the talk turned to that favourite Toronto topic: real estate prices. All three couples at the table bought their houses about 20 years back. Since then, prices in our gentrifying west-end neighbourhood have soared. Semi-detached Victorians that went for $200,000 or so in the early 1990s now fetch four or five times that. "We're all millionaires!" one neighbour said. On paper, anyway.
The ongoing, seemingly endless run-up in Toronto real estate prices continues to amaze. A tiny two-storey row house down the alley from us was gutted, renovated to within an inch of its life and put on the market for $800,000 plus. A silver Mercedes now sits on the backyard parking pad.
Down the street, a cramped semi-detached that the real estate blurb calls full of original character - a complete fixer-upper, in other words - is listed in the $800,000s, too. Whoever buys it will probably have to spend at least another couple of hundred thousand to bring it up to standard.
This sort of thing is happening all over town. A converted garage in the east end known to some locals as "the shack" recently went to an investor for $165,000. At 210 square feet, it looks like a children's playhouse. It has a sitting room and bedroom but no kitchen, bathroom or, for that matter, running water.
Or consider the case of the "murder house." A man was killed in the detached Ossington Avenue property in 2011. His body was found in the entry way. This spring the place sold for $900,000 regardless.
It can all seem a little crazy. My grandmother's old house in the Beach, a lovely but smallish place at the top of Neville Park Boulevard, sold this spring for more than $860,000. When she moved out in 1995, she got just $260,000 for it, but then, family lore has it that, when the family moved in after the Second World War, they paid $2,500.
My own parents bought their first house in Moore Park for $17,000 in about 1960. It was a semi-detached overlooking Mount Pleasant Cemetery. It must be worth more than a million now. They moved up to a bigger, detached house next to the park around 10 years later and still paid only $35,000.
The experts have been warning for years that a crash is coming, and perhaps it is, but the real-estate boom rolls on and on. People say there is no way young couples can afford a downtown house any more, but young couples keep buying them, even if means being mortgaged to the hilt.
"I think it's always been hard to buy a first house," says Dianne Chaput, a real-estate agent in the Beach. "Think about what people did to get a house back in the day."
To look on the bright side, it says good things about the city that house prices keeping going up and up. It means people want to live here and are willing to pay a premium. It takes faith to pay so much for bricks and mortar. Buyers are investing not just in the house, but in the future of the city, and the future of Toronto seems bright.
From Leslieville to the Junction, once down-at-heel neighbourhoods are profiting from the hunger to live in the city. Thousands of run-down houses are being returned to their former glory, and better. Tens of thousands of older residents are cashing out, funding their retirement from the proceeds of a house sale.
If it seems cruel to the young that house prices are so high, it is worse in some other places. Prices have sailed through the roof in cities around the world from Hong Kong to New York to London. A British friend bought his big house in North London for £32,000 ($52,000) in 1977, about four times his salary at that time. It is worth £1.2-million today - by his reckoning, about 25 times the average annual British salary.

Full text:   REAL ESTATE REPORTER
The Canadian Real Estate Association will release August's home sales figures on Monday morning, and they will point at a market that is rebounding - for now.
Local real estate boards across the country have already released their data for the month. Toronto saw a 21-per-cent jump in the number of homes that sold over the Multiple Listing Service compared to a year earlier; Vancouver surged ahead 52.5 per cent; Calgary was up 27.5 per cent; Victoria 20.7 per cent; and Edmonton 9.9 per cent.
"With results from most major cities now in hand, it looks like August home sales were up about 13 per cent year-over-year nationally, with average prices rising somewhere in the 7-per-cent year-over-year range - though big sales gains in pricey Vancouver are again biasing up average price growth," Bank of Montreal economist Robert Kavcic wrote in a research note.
The market is bouncing back from the slump that began in July 2012, after federal Finance Minister Jim Flaherty tightened the country's mortgage insurance rules. His changes included cutting the maximum length of an insured mortgage to 25 years from 30.
"Home prices have awakened from the policy-induced slumber," Toronto-Dominion Bank economist Sonya Gulati said in a research note on Friday, after the Teranet House Price Index (which looks at 11 Canadian cities) showed an increase in August for the sixth month in a row. Meanwhile, data from the National Household Survey last week showed that the proportion of homeowners who are financially stretched has risen notably since 2006.
"With the housing market showing some renewed life and Canadian household debt burdens still increasing, the domestic risks to the Canadian economy have not exited the building," Ms. Gulati wrote. The country's banking regulator, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, is still considering changes to the mortgage lending rules that banks must follow.
But economists are not certain that the housing market's rebound will last.
"Is the rebound for real? The jury is out," Bank of Nova Scotia economist Derek Holt wrote in a research note. Industry players say that fears about rising mortgage rates spurred some potential buyers to pull the trigger this summer.
If that's the case, "the recent pickup could be a head fake, with a sales correction set to resume toward year-end and into next year," Mr. Holt wrote.
Either way, Ms. Gulati says that "as mortgage rates creep up over the next few years, the housing market should soften once again."

Full text:   Sahil Sadat fled Afghanistan last year to escape the Taliban, arriving in Germany only to discover a new kind of fear.
Placed in a newly opened refugee centre in Berlin's predominantly white, working class Marzahn-Hellersdorf neighbourhood, Mr. Sadat and others watched from the dilapidated old school building as supporters of the far-right National Democratic Party (NPD) demonstrated noisily outside demanding the home's closing.
"Someone came to me and a friend and said we should go back to our homeland," said Mr. Sadat, 18. "They said if they saw us again, they would hurt us."
But German neighbours, incensed at the threats, are rallying to the aid of asylum-seekers. They now keep a round-the-clock vigil outside the centre to protect the refugees. They remain there every day, escorting the refugees to buy groceries and other necessities nearby.
"It's important for people to visibly work together against right-wing extremists," said Ulf Buenermann, a member of the local Mobile Counselling Team against Right-Wing Extremism, a government-financed program that counsels communities how to fight extremism. "You can see that [the extremists] lose their confidence, influence and strength when civil society takes a stand and takes back public spaces."
The German parliament has debated a ban on the NPD several times over the last 12 years. But courts raised concerns over the constitutionality of a ban, and others have questioned whether a ban would have much effect on the ideology that supports the party. In the vacuum, local civic groups have banded together to take action to push extremist businesses and groups out of communities where they have gained a foothold.
"The asylum seekers don't bother me. The right-wing extremists do," said Janina Koch, a young mother in Marzahn-Hellersdorf who recently stopped by the refugee centre to ask how she could donate children's clothes. "I'm also scared - it's not nice having this around you and your child."
In the Schoeneweide district of eastern Berlin, residents stage protests and pressured landlords to include clauses in rental contracts aimed at keeping out right-wing activities. One target has been the Hangman pub, which offers a "Himla" cocktail made of raspberry rum and lemonade and named for the infamous Nazi SS commander Heinrich Himmler. Recently, the landlord of the building housing the pub served the owner with an eviction notice.
"We don't want to have any rental agreements with Nazis," said Bernd Ital, a spokesman for the real estate company ZBI Group. "They rented with us for a few years but when we found out the bar's right-wing extremist connections, we reconsidered the contract."

Abstract: It's prompted a court battle between its owner, Ahmed Elbasiouni, and the City of Brampton. This week a court hearing left Mr. Elbasiouni with three options, two of which - demolishing the house or redesigning it completely - will make a costly project even more costly. "I'm broke right now. I cannot find a way to refinance that or approve the financing for that," Mr. Elbasiouni said. "Who is going to lend me money?"

Full text:   The partly constructed house at 443 Centre Street North in Brampton looks like it was dropped from the sky - it's the big blue whale in a sea of modest bungalows, semis and detached homes. For now, it's a shell of a dwelling made of teal-tinted wood, but plans call for eight bedrooms, 10 bathrooms and (including the basement) 11,000 square feet of living space.
The house was erected last summer and has been in a state of limbo since February, when the city revoked the owner's building permits, saying they were issued in error. Neighbours who say it's an "eyesore" want it demolished. It's become a drive-by tourist attraction.
And it's prompted a court battle between its owner, Ahmed Elbasiouni, and the City of Brampton. This week a court hearing left Mr. Elbasiouni with three options, two of which - demolishing the house or redesigning it completely - will make a costly project even more costly. "I'm broke right now. I cannot find a way to refinance that or approve the financing for that," Mr. Elbasiouni said. "Who is going to lend me money?"
The debate has extended well beyond the neighbourhood. Outside Nunavut, Brampton has the highest portion of multifamily households in the country.
Many residents fear those families will build much larger homes, such as the ones going up in Toronto's affluent suburban neighbourhoods.
"If this is allowed to go ahead, they're going to spring up everywhere," said Ros Feldman, a community activist who lives a few kilometres away. What happens on Centre Street North will set a precedent, she says. "They need to be stopped now."
Permit problems
Before the large home was built at 443 Centre Street North, the lot was occupied by a 2,000-square-foot bungalow. Mr. Elbasiouni, with the help of his father and brothers, purchased it in 2010. Property records show he paid $381,000.
Neighbours learned Mr. Elbasiouni was planning to build a second-storey addition last June when they spotted a building permit on his fence. And this is where Mr. Elbasiouni's version of events differs from his neighbours' and city councillors'.
Mr. Elbasiouni said his original plan was to modify the basement and main floors of his house and build a second-storey addition. When the roof was removed, the crew on site discovered the house was was not structurally sound to support a second floor and so he then demolished it, he said.
He then re-envisioned plans for an expansive, three-storey house and got a building permit for it.
Mr. Elbasiouni said at most, the residence would have eight permanent occupants, but it would also serve as a "satellite house" for extended family visiting from his home country. He said it was only after neighbours complained that the city issued a stop-work order on construction.
When Mr. Elbasiouni was told the city had issued him the permits in error, he asked how the situation could be rectified and was told there was no way, he said. Having poured more than $800,000 into construction of the house, a frustrated Mr. Elbasiouni filed an appeal with the court.
The debacle with his home has apparently made Mr. Elbasiouni infamous.
He did not want to reveal his country of origin, how many people are in his family, his occupation or his age out of fear that sharing personal details will only bring him further harassment from people he encounters on the street. (For the same reason, he asked not to be photographed for this story.)
He said people have given him the middle finger, sworn at him and thrown garbage at him. He says he plans to launch a website to inform neighbours of his side of the story and wants to hold a meeting with the community to understand what their wishes are for the lot.
"I explained to a neighbour I'm trying to help them and help myself. But they have to understand we have to work together," he said.
Meanwhile, the outcry from residents over this issue prompted city council to pass a temporary by-law that limits expansions and new builds of homes in future projects to a maximum size of 15 per cent larger than the square footage of the existing home.
While Mr. Elbasiouni sees himself as the victim of mistakes made by the city, neighbours and local city Councillors Grant Gibson and Elaine Moore said he may have misled the city and had a plan to get rid of the original bungalow all along.
Soon after the house was demolished, a real estate listing was posted for the empty lot for $499,000. Ms. Moore said a demolition permit was never issued to Mr. Elbasiouni.
In August, a Brampton judge said it was "unreasonable" for the chief building officer to revoke Mr. Elbasiouni's building permit without giving him a chance to remedy the situation. At a hearing this week, Justice Kofi Barnes gave him three options: apply for a permit to demolish the house, apply for new building permits with a new design, or apply to the city's committee of adjustment for permission to continue building the house (the committee would have to agree that the structure varies only in minor ways from zoning restrictions).
Across the city, residents are wondering what precedent this could set if Mr. Elbasiouni is granted the third option and is able to complete the house.
Lynne Murphy, who lives across the street, said she believes selling prices of homes in the area have taken a dip since construction began on Mr. Elbasiouni's property.
"My husband and I should have said to him, 'If you wanted to build something this big, why the hell didn't you just go further up north, buy a piece of land and put it up? Why did you have to put it in our cozy little neighbourhood?'" she said.
To that, Mr. Elbasiouni explains he couldn't find a lot of equivalent size for as good a deal in any other part of the city with favourable zoning.
As frustrated as others are with Mr. Elbasiouni, they say much blame falls to the city as well. Mr. Elbasiouni and his neighbours say they have been waiting seven months for staff to report how the building permits were mistakenly issued in the first place.
"I think the city has made a hell of a mistake and that somebody's head should have rolled for it," Ms. Feldman said. "You don't give somebody the wrong permit ... and then turn around and say, 'We gave you the wrong permit,' after the thing is already up."
Whatever the resolution, Mr. Elbasiouni said he's apprehensive about moving back to Centre Street North given the furor over his house. "I'm not a person who will live in there and enjoy it," Mr. Elbasiouni said.

Full text:   Daniel Fournier, chief executive of Ivanhoe Cambridge
I am slightly distracted as I sit down to lunch with Daniel Fournier, the CEO of Ivanhoe Cambridge, one of the 10 largest real estate investors in the world. I've just learned that Jude Law is in a nearby room.
Mr. Fournier and I are at Epic Restaurant in the Royal York Hotel, which is buzzing over the Toronto International Film Festival. Black SUVs are lined up out front, gawkers are milling about, and the occasional entourage-flanked actor passes by. But I can't imagine any of them get better treatment than Mr. Fournier and me. Ivanhoe Cambridge, the real estate arm of Caisse de depôt et placement du Quebec , owns this hotel, a small part of its $35-billion stable of assets, and someone from the firm called ahead to ask for a quiet table where he could be interviewed.
In no time an amuse-bouche appears before us, consisting of cherry tomatoes from the hotel's own garden, marinated with olive oil and accompanied by burrata cheese and crostini. Waiters hang on our every word.
"The last time I was here I got a club sandwich," quips Mr. Fournier, 59. He may have studied at Princeton and Oxford, but with his friendly demeanour I can't imagine him ever throwing his weight around - except when he played for the Ottawa Rough Riders.
Mr. Fournier and his team at Ivanhoe are still debating whether to sell or refurbish the Royal York, which opened in 1929 and has hosted several functions attended by Queen Elizabeth II. Shortly after taking the helm of the Caisse's real estate arm a few years ago, he decided to sell most of its hotels, something it's been doing since 2011.
"We can't be all things to all people," he says. The company once owned as many as 60 hotels, but Mr. Fournier wants it to concentrate on the property classes it knows best: retail, office and residential.
Ivanhoe Cambridge is invested in more than 60 shopping centres, 170 office properties and a growing portfolio of residential properties, including a large number of apartments in Silicon Valley and London, England.
Although hotels didn't make his short list, the Royal York is one of a few that he's reluctant to part with, along with the Château Frontenac and the Fairmont Hotel Vancouver. "They're phenomenal assets, hugely challenging because the capital required is immense, but you just know that something special could and should happen," he says. "I mean, I look at the Château Frontenac and I just think of Roosevelt, Churchill, and a few others planning out the Second World War."
Mr. Fournier has been a history buff ever since leaving Quebec at the age of 16 with a scholarship to New Hampshire's Phillips Exeter Academy. After Exeter, he went to Princeton and then Oxford. "I had told my mom I'd be back in a few years, and a few years ended up being nine," he says, as the waiter clears his butternut squash soup.
That included a stint in Canada, in 1977, when Mr. Fournier played for the Rough Riders. He had been captain of the team at Princeton, and was subsequently drafted by the Canadian Football League as he was accepted to Oxford. When a fellow student asked for permission to skip a term to be quarterback for the Los Angeles Rams, Mr. Fournier decided to follow his lead. "My law tutor was not very impressed, I can tell you."
He chose to return to Oxford after one term in Ottawa, but regrets not trying football a little longer to see how it went. Mr. Fournier ultimately returned to Montreal at 25, and within a short time he was hired at Canderel, where he received a crash course in real estate. That gave him "the entrepreneurial bug," which pushed him to form a small company, Equidev. It would take Montreal by storm with a string of local acquisitions, including the Ogilvy department store and the city's Ritz-Carlton. A Globe profile in 1988 noted that Mr. Fournier, who was then 34, Bill Tresham, who was the 33-year-old president of Ogilvy, and their crew were known in town as "the boys." They transformed the once-stuffy Ogilvy "into a showcase of such international fashion superstars as Versace and Valentino," the Globe noted.
Mr. Fournier knew Mr. Tresham from Princeton. Decades later, in 2010, when Caisse CEO Michael Sabia hired Mr. Fournier to run the pension fund's real estate business, Mr. Fournier convinced Mr. Tresham to come on board as Ivanhoe's head of investments.
The two look out for each other. Mr. Tresham spurred Mr. Fournier to run a marathon a number of years ago, when Mr. Fournier had let his physical condition slide a bit.
Mr. Sabia frequently reminds employees at the Caisse that the long-term investment game is a marathon, not a sprint. "Every time he says it, I get the shakes," Mr. Fournier says, laughing at his marathon experience as he tucks into his salmon. "My biggest downfall is food," he says.
Mr. Fournier married in his mid-30s, and the couple had four children in five years. He and his family often spend time at their log cabin about three hours from Montreal. A firm believer in public service, Mr. Fournier ran as a Conservative in the 2006 federal election in the storied riding of Outremont, long a Liberal stronghold. The Liberal candidate held onto the seat.
"His only lapse of judgment in my opinion is he ran as a Tory," said former Ontario Premier David Peterson, a Liberal. "But we laugh about this. He's not partisan in any way, he's a public servant. He's got a wonderful wife and wonderful family, all the beautiful values."
A couple of years later, Mr. Fournier did a stint at SITQ, one of the Caisse's real estate subsidiaries at the time. "It was right in the middle of the [financial] crisis, I'm the chief investment officer, and it was very clear that there were no acquisitions to speak of for the next couple of years," he says. "That's not my style to go at 40 or 50 per cent of my capacity." He left after a little more than a year, only to be lured back by Mr. Sabia a short time later.
One of Mr. Fournier's first major decisions in his current role was to merge the Caisse's real estate subsidiaries, SITQ and Ivanhoe Cambridge, into one. "We wanted to have one balance sheet, one board," he says, as office and retail deals began to top $1-billion.
He set about putting a new strategy in place, the one that left hotels on the chopping block. Montreal remains key, and the company will be investing in several of its properties there, including the Eaton Centre, Place Montreal Trust, and Complexe Les Ailes. Shopping centres are also key. Ivanhoe owns 42 of them in Canada, which currently attract 290 million visitors a year, and is investing to grow that number.
The U.S., meanwhile, is likely to become a larger component of the portfolio, though Mr. Fournier is cautious. "We've looked at all kinds of retail opportunities in the U.S., but we haven't even come close to finding something," he says.
Ivanhoe is forging ahead in the U.S. office market, though, and recently teamed up with Callahan Capital Partners there. "Again humbly, rather than sending down some Montrealers three days a month to compete against people whose entire careers have only been about New York City, we've formed a partnership," Mr. Fournier says. The company is leaving cities where it owns only one or two properties to concentrate on New York, Seattle, Chicago, Boston and Washington - places where it can establish a critical mass.
The company has spent $2-billion on shopping centres in Brazil that are aimed at the three million people who join the middle class in that country each year. "We're looking hard for the next Brazil," Mr. Fournier says, shortly before he orders a fruit salad.
"In your opinion, is Europe a problem or is Europe an opportunity?" he asks me, clearly leaning toward the second option. Ivanhoe is working on opportunities to buy the debt of beleaguered real estate companies as a way of obtaining assets at a discount, the type of strategy that helped it and private equity firm TPG takeover the Woolgate Exchange office building in London's business district this year.
A dozen cookies, biscotti and macaroons arrive for me even though I declined dessert. As the waiter sets a huge plate of fruit down for Mr. Fournier, he says that one of the reasons he loves history is that it always repeats.
"Our annualized yield over the last 10 years is 12.5 per cent," he says, plucking a macaroon from the plate. "But it would have been out of the park had we bought in 2008 and 2009. So you say to yourself, if anything happens in the next four or five years, try to be in position."

Full text:   $165,000 paid for a 210-sq. ft. home with no kitchen or bathroom. Welcome to the fall real estate market
A tiny Toronto house that caused a storm in the Twitterverse for its large asking price has found a buyer.
The diminutive property sold firm for $165,000, says real estate agent Paul Vallis of Real Estate Homeward. The buyer struck a deal for 28 per cent off the asking price of $229,000 after three weeks on the market for the 210-square-foot house some locals knew as "the shack."
"My client is pretty happy," says Mr. Vallis of the seller.
The converted garage measures 210 square feet on a 14-by-20-foot lot. It has a sitting room and a wee bedroom but no bathroom or kitchen.
Mr. Vallis says the purchaser is a real estate investor who will likely rebuild.
"It's an investor who is looking for small, unique properties like this," he says.
Real estate mavens on Twitter are shocked that house prices in Toronto have become so steep and many pointed to this property as an example.
John Andrew is another market watcher who is shocked.
Prof. Andrew is director of the executive seminars on corporate and investment real estate at Queen's University and he finds it perplexing that prices for houses and condos in Toronto are still so lofty. He figures that people who were waiting for prices to fall eventually gave up and decided to buy - especially when they saw that long-term mortgage rates are creeping up.
"People who go online after Labour Day are seeing that mortgage rates have gone up since the last time they looked," Prof. Andrew said. "And they were already kicking themselves," because they didn't buy sooner, he adds.
Prof. Andrew was one of those forecasting a fall in prices that didn't materialize. He knows young first-time buyers who eventually got tired of waiting and gave up their search.
"A lot of people were waiting for prices to come down," Prof. Andrew said. "They're not coming down and it almost seems like they're never coming down."
Long-term rates have risen almost a full percentage point if you go back about seven months, Prof. Andrew points out. The news has been reported but the gradual increase escaped the notice of a lot of buyers until now, he adds.
"I think this surge right now really is all about mortgage rates."
Ricky Chada, an agent with Royal LePage Estate Realty in Toronto, says that he has a few buyers on the go right now who fit that profile. The first-time purchasers are discovering that their target neighbourhood or condo building is no longer in their price range.
"Now what they could have afforded a few months ago is no longer affordable and they have to go for something slightly less."
Housing markets across the country sprang to life in August - though the comparisons are to a particularly moribund August last year when the federal government's tighter rules on mortgage insurance had recently come into effect.
The Toronto Real Estate Board recently reported sales in the Greater Toronto Area for August, 2013 jumped 21 per cent compared with August, 2012.
Property sales in Vancouver jumped a whopping 52.5 per cent from a year earlier, Calgary tallied a 27.5 per cent increase and Victoria, 20.7 per cent.
In the Greater Toronto Area, the average price rose 5.5 per cent to $503,094 compared with $477,170 in August, 2012, while new listings increased 4.5 per cent for the same period.
David Madani of Capital Economics is still pessimistic: He sees signs that a "day of reckoning" is around the corner.
The improvement in existing home sales and housing starts since the start of 2013 has some industry watchers "gloating" that the market has achieved a soft landing - or maybe even no landing - Mr. Madani says in a research note, but he points out that numbers are open to interpretation.
Mr. Madani also believes these avid buyers are simply trying to make a purchase before the clock runs out on their pre-approved mortgage. Long-term mortgage rates have been creeping up and Mr. Madani thinks the rush to buy may simply be pulling sales forward from next year.
Prof. Andrew has looked back over 25 years of data and says that an increase in mortgage rates after a relatively stable period often leads to a flurry of sales. But that spurt is usually followed by a decline that is about twice as steep as the climb, he says.
The professor is looking out to November, 2013 and warning that the traditional winter dreariness could be even grimmer than usual this year.

Full text:   Suzanne Mess likes things the way they are in a house where the woodwork, polished by decades of use, is smooth as silk
Asking price: $1.5-million
Taxes: $23,070 (2013)
Lot size: 8 acres
Agent: David Lester (Royal LePage ProAlliance Realty)
The Back Story
It was 1898 when a young banker named Edward Osler purchased the Cedars as a summer retreat for his family, just outside of Cobourg on the Lake Ontario shore. Suzanne Mess was the granddaughter who grew up playing tennis on the lawns, bounding along the sandy beach and swimming in the waves.
"Our childhood here was rather marvellous," says Ms. Mess as she recalls running freely with her older brother and cousins.
Many decades later, Ms. Mess is preparing to relinquish stewardship of the house that has remained in the family for 115 years.
The first owner of 589 King St. West was Dr. Thomas White, who bought the land in the early 1880s and had the house built soon after, according to real estate agent David Lester of Royal LePage Pro Alliance Realty. Dr. John Clark bought the house from Dr. White and sold it a few years later to Charles Guillet.
Over the years, Ms. Mess says, the original summer kitchen was knocked off and an addition was built to contain a large indoor kitchen and pantry. The doctor's office was eventually turned into a bathroom but Ms. Mess points out the marble-topped basin where he washed his hands - with the original taps still there.
The red brick dwelling has a centre hall plan, six bedrooms and a wraparound veranda. The brick coach house, which still stands at the rear is where Lady the horse resided. Ms. Mess still has a vintage photograph of Lady pulling the family's carriage.
"She always wanted a piece of toast before she would go on her way," she adds with a smile.
Eventually the Osler family sold their house in the town and moved to the Cedars full-time.
The house sits surrounded by perennial gardens, green lawns and woodland on eight acres. The rocky shoreline stretches for about 140 metres along the property. The wide beach gradually disappeared when the St. Lawrence Seaway was built, says Ms. Mess as she watches the waves roll in.
"We've always been really happy here."
The House Today
The exterior of the house and parts of the interior are protected by local heritage conservation rules, but Ms. Mess didn't need such edicts to maintain the elements she has staunchly guarded from change since her grandfather's day.
In the kitchen, she points to the original farmhouse table, antique dishes, and a line of 11 coffee pots in descending order of size.
A local carpenter built additional cabinets and shelves in the style of the original cabinets, which remain unchanged except for successive coats of fresh white paint.
Even the hole made by a mouse chewing through the cupboard door remains as a whimsical piece of the home's history.
"I couldn't take it out - it broke me up."
In a touch reminiscent of Downton Abbey, the kitchen also has a row of bells - with one for each bedroom.
That way the maid and housekeeper knew which room was summoning help, explains Ms. Mess.
In the pantry, the wooden countertop has been worn to a smooth finish.
"It's like silk," says Ms. Mess about the counter.
"It has never been polished - it's just years of wiping it down and using it."
A few renovations have been done since Ms. Mess decided to make the Cedars her home after her retirement from a career as a costume designer for the Canadian Opera Company and the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. She added the main floor bathroom, for example, because for decades the house had only one.
Ms. Mess also undertook the refurbishment of the front hall and dining room. These areas fall under heritage protection because of the highly unusual wall covering made of papier maché.
It was the third owner, Mr. Guillet, who used newspapers and glue to create the surface, says Ms. Mess. She worked with the set designers and artisans who were restoring the historic theatre in nearby Port Hope to renew the walls and a mural painted on the dining room ceiling.
The Best Feature
The heavy wooden banister lining the curved staircase was irresistible to the children, says Ms. Mess.
"The boys used to slide down this but somebody had to be at the bottom to catch them."
Ms. Mess acknowledges that it's difficult for her to let the old house go, but the younger generations of her family are widely dispersed these days.
"If somebody buys it who's happy, I'll be happy."

"If we have crop prices coming down this year like we expect, we would have crop receipts coming down which would lower pressure on farmland values."

Full text:   Europeans seeking farmland on the Prairies now face competition from local farmers and even investment funds
The rolling parkland hills of Riding Mountain National Park aren't as ruggedly beautiful as the Welsh Hills that Paul and Helen French could see from their former home in Shropshire in the West Midlands of Britain. Still, the couple can't help but feel lucky to have found their piece of pastoral paradise in the Canadian West.
After immigrating to Canada a little more than six years ago with their two children, the couple now own and run Frenchs Farm and Cottage Guest House on more than 900 acres - six quarter sections - east of the park in western Manitoba.
"We had a good life in the U.K., but we couldn't get into farming there," says Mr. French, who worked as an engineer in Britain. On the advice of a friend who moved to Saskatchewan to farm, they came to Canada and, after some tire-kicking in other provinces, bought the land they farm today.
"Manitoba was the cheapest," Mr. French says. "At the time, a family of four could survive on $40,000 a year."
More importantly, the Frenchs were able to do what they couldn't in Britain - buy land. In 2006, they paid about $400 an acre for their farm, now home to 180 grass-fed cattle and a few dozen heritage-breed hogs.
"When we left, land in the U.K. was a good £10,000 [about $20,000] an acre," Mr. French says.
Certainly, the French's story is a familiar one in Canada with its long history of European farmers seeking opportunities they couldn't find in their homelands. Yet more recently, global demand for arable farmland has pushed prices up across Canada, making the prospects for would-be farmers like the French family much less viable. Last year saw a record increase of 19.46 per cent for agricultural land in Canada, Farm Credit Canada statistics show.
"We got in at the right time," says Ms. French, adding that their land is now worth about $700 per acre. "We wouldn't have got what we've got if we had come over now."
Up until the last few years, European farmers saw opportunity coming to farm in Canada. What was once a familiar occurrence a few years ago, however, slowed substantially after 2008 when interest rates cratered and grain and other agricultural commodity prices soared, spurring a farmland real estate boom.
Agricultural land real estate agent Dolf Feddes, who emigrated from the Netherlands with his family in 1999, says European immigration is much lower compared with a decade ago.
"Years ago we went to Europe to do presentations and attend trade shows to recruit farmers, but in the last few years, we've cut back because here is where the action is," says the hog farmer and real estate agent with Canadian Farm Realty.
In southern Manitoba, local and Ontario farmers, seeking substantially lower-cost land than in their own province, have been buying up tracts of prime cropland. "Ever since 2008, we've had a grain boom so [land] prices exploded," Mr. Feddes says.
Some are buying to expand operations and are able to borrow more at low interest rates. Others are renting to other farmers. Mr. Feddes says land in southern Manitoba that rented for $50 to $65 an acre about five ago now fetches between $100 and $140.
Investment funds seeking safer assets than the stock and bond markets are also driving demand, says Harold Davis, an agricultural prices analyst with Prairie Crop Charts in Winnipeg.
"The lack of safe assets drives holders of capital to explore a wider range of investments, including non-traditional investment assets such farmland," he says.
Agcapita is a Calgary-based fund company that invests in agricultural farmland in Saskatchewan. Stephen Johnston, a partner with the firm, says it is among the largest of a handful of investment firms offering Canadian retail investors access to farmland investment, and it's the only RRSP eligible farmland fund in Canada.
While demand for farmland is high, Mr. Johnston says Canadian investment rules prohibit non-residents and publicly traded firms from owning farmland in Canada, and has kept investment funds to a small fraction of the overall investment in agricultural land, he says.
"Agricultural investment funds make up only about $200-million of more than $150-billion in farmland real estate in Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Alberta," he says. "My estimate is that funds own no more than 0.1 per cent to 0.2 per cent of all the farmland Western Canada so they are a very small component of the overall market."
While interest from investors is growing, farmers seeking to take advantage of higher crop prices are primarily driving prices upward in Canada, Mr. Johnston says.
Although several straight years of record prices have raised concerns that the bubble may be about to burst, J.P. Gervais, the chief economist with Farm Credit Canada, a Crown corporation, says the hope is for a soft landing.
"People keep talking about the condo market in Vancouver and Toronto and how they'd like to see a soft landing to a cooling market, and that's also what we would want to see," Mr. Gervais says. "If we have crop prices coming down this year like we expect, we would have crop receipts coming down which would lower pressure on farmland values."
Ontario farmland prices led the nation in 2012 increasing about 30 per cent; in Manitoba prices have jumped about 26 per cent, and in Saskatchewan, 20 per cent, FCC figures show. Overall, prices across Canada have been on the uptick since 1993. Statistics Canada data for per acre prices for agricultural land and buildings show that average prices have risen from $555 in 1993 to $1,798 in 2012.
Although prices are soaring in some regions for certain types of land, opportunities for lower-cost farmland still exist in Manitoba, says Neil Fraser, a real estate agent with Rolling River Realty in the western part of the province. Pasture land values have not seen the same rise as crop land, partly due to the BSE cattle scare a decade ago.
"Demand for grain land is so strong I could sell 20,000 acres within a week if I had it," he says. "Where we are up here in parkland, this is traditionally cattle country, and a lot of the calls I've been getting on ranchland are from the Europeans."
Frenchs Farm is by no means a large operation, and it has yet to turn a profit so both Paul and Helen French work other jobs - Paul as a welder and Helen as a bookkeeper for businesses in the village of Kelwood near their farm.
Then again, they didn't leave good careers in Britain thinking they'd get rich farming in Canada, says Ms. French, a former civil servant. They sought the slower-paced lifestyle and open spaces.
"We got the lifestyle we wanted - even if it's not the financial one we anticipated," she says with a laugh.

Full text:   Former MLSE interm head's crown jewel was an MLS team that quickly went from exciting expansion to sad-sack loser
jblair@globeandmail.com
The broom finally caught Tom Anselmi on Friday.
Fittingly, he was swept out just 24 hours after Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment Ltd. honcho Tim Leiweke made Kevin Payne the eighth major executive or coach fired in the seven-year history of Toronto FC - because it is Anselmi's stewardship of the MLS franchise that effectively ruined his chances of getting Leiweke's job on a full-time basis.
Anselmi, who headed MLSE on an interim basis between Richard Peddie's departure and Leiweke's hiring, resigned from his position as chief operating officer after 17 years with the organization.
It has been a summer of change within MLSE, what with Leiweke firing Toronto Raptors president/general manager Bryan Colangelo, extending David Nonis's contract as GM of the Toronto Maple Leafs, cleaning house at TFC and letting go of, or reassigning, several mid-level executives.
Anselmi, whose status had been a subject of discussion and innuendo since Leiweke was hired June 30, announced his resignation via a press release.
Leiweke was not available for comment, beyond a line in the release that stated: "The entire organization, including our ownership group, is grateful to Tom for his many contributions to the success of Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment over the years."
There is no doubting Anselmi's popularity both within the MLSE framework and within the local media community. He was an accessible, thoughtful sports executive and did good work for the company in the area of facilities development and management.
But for most fans, Anselmi has remained scarred by his experiences atop TFC - a franchise that went from being a jewel of Major League Soccer, complete with a season-ticket waiting list, to a no-hoper on the field, surpassed quickly by Canadian cousins Montreal Impact and Vancouver Whitecaps and playing in front of increasingly empty sections at BMO Field.
Anselmi had responsibility for TFC in his position as MLSE executive vice-president and COO, and his tenure was marked by a seemingly never-ending series of poor administrative decisions.
TFC went from misplaced faith in a storied Scot (Mo Johnston) and augmented him with an old North American hand: Predrag (Preki) Radosavljevic, who was the third head coach to work under Johnston.
Then, it was soccer's version of a bad acid trip: German icon and current U.S. coach Jurgen Klinsmann was hired as an adviser and he, in turn, suggested TFC turn to Aron Winter, who cut his teeth in the storied AFC Ajax development system in the Netherlands, and who was clueless when it came to the reality of both the travel and talent level in MLS.
Then, came Payne: four MLS titles with other teams, an international pedigree - done after just nine months.
The stain followed Anselmi even as he kept the president/CEO's seat warm for Leiweke.
Maple Leafs? Raptors?
Anselmi was the TFC guy, on whose watch it was at one time more expensive to see a professional soccer match in Toronto than it was to watch Manchester United play a Premiership match at Old Trafford.
Anselmi remained the personification of the lost hope that is TFC. Despite the sizable amount of currency he had among MLSE employees, whispers were he had no chance of being the permanent successor to Peddie. Anselmi, it was thought, was an okay technician but not a big-picture guy.
History will not be entirely fair to Anselmi, just as it won't be fair to Peddie: They had a hand in building MLSE into an economic powerhouse, replete with real estate properties, and made fistfuls of money for the owners - but that matters naught to fans interested in championships and banners.
And while Leiweke's still in the ascendency in these parts, he knows as well as anybody that he, too, will ultimately be judged by titles won.

Full text:   Under an overcast sky, Christa MacArthur is thumbing through seed packets at her garden - two dirt-filled boxes, each 40-by-48 inches, in the North Hastings Community Garden.
Ms. MacArthur says she and her family live in an apartment and spent more than a year on a waiting list for another neighbourhood garden before getting a plot in this one.
"We're mostly growing things to eat," Ms. MacArthur said, as her daughter Eri played with a hose nearby. "And food you grow yourself tastes better."
While that claim may lack supporting data, there is ample evidence that Ms. MacArthur and others like her are changing the landscape of the city. Vancouver has more than 75 community gardens and a dozen or so urban farms, including ones that focus on creating jobs and healthy food in the inner city. Vancouver's Greenest City 2020 Action Plan calls for "food assets" - including community gardens, farmers' markets and urban farms - to increase at least 50 per cent over 2010 levels.
But the pattern of turning vacant lots into gardens has also raised questions about taxes and land use, such as whether tax breaks for developers who turn sites into gardens encourage them to put off construction until they can turn a higher profit. For the city, which unveiled a Local Food Action Plan in July, striking a balance between people clamouring for a plot of their own and business, property and tax concerns can be a thorny business.
"Community gardens are viewed as this amazingly beautiful, harmonious experience - but they often generate a remarkable amount of tension," says Michael Ableman, co-founder of Sole Food Street Farms, whose four Vancouver commercially focused sites aim to grow enough produce to pay employees and turn a profit.
"If you look at most of our cities, what is left for people to grow food or experience some bits and pieces of the natural world are literally little specks throughout the city - so they become valuable," Mr. Ableman says.
That's especially the case in Vancouver, where land is pricey and development sites are in short supply - unlike, say, in American cities such as Detroit, where authorities are looking to urban agriculture as one way to spur recovery in the bankrupt city.
When a site goes from vacant lot to garden, B.C. Assessment can reclassify it for tax purposes from "business or commercial" to "recreational or non-profit," reducing owners' tax bills by nearly 70 per cent.
In 2009 - when eight vacant development lots with an assessed value of $76.2-million were reclassified - city council became worried enough by the urban farming trend to order staff to look at options to ensure a "fair taxation model" that would not shift the tax burden to other commercial property owners.
The flurry of conversions, which coincided with a crash in financial and real estate markets, has since slowed.
There were no conversions last year and two in each of 2011 and 2010, according to the city's annual tax distribution reports.
The two most recent conversions resulted in tax savings to the owners of about $47,000 - barely a nick to the city's annual property tax revenue of more than $640-million.
As of 2012, about 7 per cent of all community gardens were temporary conversions, according to information provided by the city.
"Developers and commercial landowners will eventually convert the site back to their intended use, and BC Assessment will reclassify the property to reflect such a change," a Vancouver representative said in an e-mailed response to questions.
That is little comfort to Agnes Crescenzo, who says her Bianca Maria Italian Foods, a block west of the new North Hastings Community Garden, has seen a drop in business since other small businesses closed to be replaced by the garden.
"It's hurt business in the area," Ms. Crescenzo said. "There's less foot traffic and people don't have reason to stop."
London Drugs, which has a store on the 2500-block, started buying neighbouring properties with an eye to a mixed commercial-residential development about six years ago.
London Drugs put that development, a 108-unit project dubbed the Alba, on hold this year after deciding there were too many condos coming on to the market.
That cleared the way for London Drugs to connect with Shifting Growth. London Drugs chief executive officer Wynne Powell says his company would have done that with or without the tax savings, which have been estimated at $60,000 to $74,000 a year.
"That was not a factor in the decision at all," Mr. Powell says, adding that the Alba is a $55-million to $60-million project and that London Drugs expects tax savings to be roughly equivalent to garden-related expenses.
As to whether London Drugs is using the garden to save taxes until it can build and sell its condominiums at a higher price, Mr. Powell says going ahead with Alba would have resulted in unnecessary risks to the company, and its employees.
"We took a balanced approach to what can give the best outcome to as many people as possible - we think this is an interesting approach."

A recently released real estate report on Canadian cities says: "Despite the 2012 drop in Vancouver's median condominium price and a further decline expected in 2013, the area's affordability is forecast to remain the weakest by far among this report's eight cities, both this year and throughout the forecast."

Full text:   A shifting market changes the math on high-rise housing
kgold@globeandmail.com
Derek Hynes was thinking like a lot of Vancouverites when he purchased his one-bedroom condo in one of Surrey's new towers. He thought its value would rise each year, enough to make the purchase an investment in his future. He'd build equity until he had enough to purchase a bigger place, maybe even the down payment on a house.
The expectation that every home should build equity is a hangover from the pre-2008 years, when it seemed that real estate had nowhere to go but up, up, up. Average income earners were purchasing presale units and flipping them by the time they were completed, pocketing $50,000 or so in the process. Those days are long over. A shift is underway. As many condo owners who purchased five years ago and are trying to sell today can attest, the equity simply did not materialize. They are often breaking even, or selling for slightly more or less. Today, a condo in Vancouver is no longer viewed as a winning investment, so much as affordable housing and forced savings plan.
And if you consider that mortgage payments are still higher than those in Toronto, condos aren't even that affordable. A recently released real estate report on Canadian cities says: "Despite the 2012 drop in Vancouver's median condominium price and a further decline expected in 2013, the area's affordability is forecast to remain the weakest by far among this report's eight cities, both this year and throughout the forecast."
The report, released by the Conference Board of Canada and Genworth Canada, also says that interest and principal payments on the median condo in Vancouver last year were a full 20 per cent more than payments in Toronto. For that reason, Mr. Hynes, who's become a father since he purchased his 620 sq. ft. condo, will rent out his condo and use the money to rent another place, in an area with better value. Mr. Hynes paid $182,000 for his condo, which was $7,000 below the asking price. He was thinking of selling the unit until he saw that his neighbour on the same floor, with the same suite, has just listed for $179,000.
"I thought it would at least keep its value, so I'm surprised," Mr. Hynes says. "If it had kept its value, I definitely would have sold right now."
He says his work colleagues, friends and relatives are facing the same situation. His cousin just sold her condo after renting it out for five years, and she lost money on it.
"It was for the exact same reason I'm losing out," Mr. Hynes says. "Because there are so many condos in the area."
There are too many new condos. Since the economic slump of 2009, condo starts have been on the rise, and above the 20-year average ratio of starts-to-population growth. Developments were going up almost as if it were 2007 again.
"This left the inventory of completed but unsold apartment condominiums very high by the past decade's standards," says the Genworth/Conference Board of Canada report, which provided those numbers.
With the slump in prices, sales have recently picked up. The benchmark price of an apartment decreased 1.1 per cent from August, 2012, to $366,100 in August this year, according to the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver. Sales last month went up 40 per cent over August, 2012.
"Even though the real estate market is booming, the prices mostly remain the same," says Vadim Marusin, who's the founder of Estateblock.com, a new real estate search engine that maps the Multiple Listing Service listings and uses colour coding to provide data on education, minority group visibility, education level, income levels, crime, violent crime, schools, daycares, transit and climate in neighbourhoods throughout the Lower Mainland. Want to live among people with a high percentage of university degrees? He's got the map that will show you. Such neighbourhood profiling might sound cold, but it makes sense in a city that's more often treated as a land bank than a community.
"If we are talking about Metro Vancouver, the hottest areas are Richmond downtown, Vancouver downtown, and Vancouver west, mostly large low-rises," Mr. Marusin says.
Urban Analytics' Michael Ferreira tracks the market on a quarterly basis, and he sees a condo glut that's softening prices.
"We've seen the unsold inventory of product under construction increase steadily over the last year," he said, seated in a coffee shop with several cranes working in the distance. "Not to the point of concern for oversupply, but certainly to the point where buyer urgency is not as great."
Because buyers know there is another building coming up, they aren't pressured to buy, adds Urban Analytics' analyst Jon Bennest.
"In some markets where there's a lot of supply and not as much demand, it's hard to say that we'll see a price increase. In others where there is less supply and consistent demand, we do see those areas increasing. So it's very specific to the submarket," says Mr. Bennest.
"Areas we see flatlining or stabilizing would be Langley and Cloverdale, for example, where you have quite a bit of supply in that market. There is a continual supply base that will make it hard for prices to come up."
Long-time commercial development analyst Richard Wozny of Site Economics, says that condo equity growth may remain a slow hill to climb.
"After six years of low interest rates and high population growth, the annual value increase was still far less than 1 per cent," he says. "Owners require rising prices to offset costs associated with mortgage payments, interest rates, property taxes, monthly operating fees, the lack of liquidity, possible vacancy and building depreciation. However, more than 340,000 new condo units - 10,000 per year - are being planned in the Metro Growth strategy.
"Massive new supply, coupled with higher interest rates should continue to keep average condo prices from rising faster than inflation."
With the city population steadily growing by about 37,000 people a year, the condo will remain the only affordable housing option for a lot of people. And the people with real equity - foreign investors and local boomers - will continue to look to them for investment.
"A lot of people have built equity over time, and have more buying power, and that is what allows our market somehow to keep going, despite the prices," says Mr. Ferreira.
With condo starts expected to stay low in comparison to the previous decade, and demand expected to rise, condo inventories should become more sustainable, the Conference Board of Canada report says. With the drop in listings and a sales increase in the forecast, prices should slightly rise between 2014 and 2017.
Mr. Hynes says he'll hang onto his condo long enough to see that happen.
"I'm in a situation where I cannot afford to sell it, so I'm going to be renting it out, probably next month.
"For me, it feels as if I am moving backward in life, but I have no choice, because I need to move on because I have a family now. I am going to move out and go rent a basement suite in Coquitlam.
"I know a lot of people can't afford their mortgages because there are tons of cheap basement suites in Coquitlam."

Full text:   Fate of 30 properties under threat for nearly four decades becomes clearer with Burlington report urging purchase of only four
In the past four decades, Jim and Marie Milners's neighbourhood along the beach in Burlington, Ont., has been picked apart. Their street and the ones that connect to it have become gap-toothed smiles: a smattering of houses interrupted by several empty lots. Dozens of neighbours have left, and their homes were bulldozed to the ground. For such prime waterfront real estate, it doesn't add up.
In 1976, the Region of Halton created a policy to buy out the homes along Burlington beach with a plan to expand public parkland. Many of the houses that bordered the water were on leased land, so when leases were up, residents were forced out. Thirty homes remain - including the Milners' - and residents have dug in their heels. After decades of limbo, they came closer Friday night to learning the fate of their houses.
Facing this steely opposition, the three partners in the development of the waterfront park (the City of Burlington, the Region of Halton and Conservation Halton) may finally introduce a timeline on acquiring the remaining homes, as well as dedicate funds to move forward with waterfront development plans.
A city staff report released Friday night recommends the purchase of only four properties of the 30 identified within a 10-year period. The report will be discussed by council next week. It's a position Burlington Mayor Rick Goldring says he largely supports, although he says he wants clarity on how long the identified homes could remain occupied.
While the three waterfront partners have not yet established a plan for what they would do with the land, Mr. Goldring says one of the priorities for improving the beach is widening the two-kilometre stretch of pathway that winds alongside the Lake Ontario shore.
The path is the dividing line between what is currently public property - the cluster of trees and bushes on top of sand dunes that borders the beach - and private property - the residents' fenced-in backyards.
"These homes do not impede anybody from using the beach," Mr. Milner said.
On a weekday afternoon, the long stretch of freshly groomed sand is mostly empty, save for a few sunbathers who are sitting down the beach, closer to downtown Burlington. Down the road from the remaining beachfront houses are several parking lots with cleared pathways that take visitors to the beach.
Another possible plan as outlined in the City of Burlington's recent staff report is moving parking lots from the side of Lakeshore Road that is closest to the beach to the other side, where most of the waterfront homes in question are.
Conservation Halton points to reasons for wanting the land that go beyond improving access to the beach. In a report, it highlighted the ecological significance of the property (which is home to many species of wildlife and plants) and the need to protect it. It also notes that the homes in question are in a zone at risk for flooding.
Burlington's mayor, as well as Marianne Meed Ward, a local councillor who has been vocal about her opposition to the acquisition policy, say if the city is now recommending some but not all houses should be bought out within a decade, residents of those homes deserve to know if they're on "the list."
"These people have been in a twist for decades," Ms. Meed Ward says. "They're even more unsettled knowing there's a list out there of identified properties and wondering if they're on it."
The Milners were relieved to learn Friday night that, after nearly 40 years in limbo, their house has not been chosen. "We're quite happy we're not on that list," Mr. Milner said. "I'm hoping that this is what [council] is going with."
Despite the reprieve for many, Ms. Meed Ward says she's still concerned that the city could try to purchase the remaining properties later on. "This just preserves the status quo [of the acquisition policy]," she said. "It actually doesn't change a thing."
Mr. Goldring said some homeowners along the beach have confessed to having trouble selling their houses because of what buyers see as a looming threat of expropriation.
Next week, Burlington council will debate the issue; on Sept. 23, councillors will vote on whether the beachfront homes should be purchased to increase parkland. The matter will then go to the Region of Halton in October for final approval.

NCC director steps down over alleged links to bid rigging

Full text:   An engineer who has been linked to a bid-rigging scandal in Quebec has temporarily stepped down from the National Capital Commission's board of directors.
François Paulhus "will not participate in NCC affairs until this matter has been resolved," the federal agency said in a statement on Wednesday.
Mr. Paulhus, who has denied any wrongdoing, was described at the Charbonneau inquiry this week as a major player in an alleged scheme to split contracts among a cartel of engineering firms in Gatineau, Que., between 2003 and 2009. For a portion of this period, Mr. Paulhus worked at Genivar, one of the four firms that allegedly predetermined which of them would win a tendering process, and submitted their bids accordingly.
Mr. Paulhus was appointed in 2012 to the NCC, which oversees large real estate holdings in the Ottawa-Gatineau region. He has also dropped his bid to run for a seat on the city council in Quebec City in the next municipal election. He has told local media he did "not participate in such a system."
Marc-André Gelinas, who worked at a firm called Tecsult, on Tuesday described the alleged bid-rigging system in Gatineau at the Charbonneau inquiry into allegations of corruption in public construction contracts. He said that, in 2003, company officials in Laval - where a similar system long existed - told him his firm and three others had agreed to split up contracts worth between $25,000 to $500,000 in Gatineau. Under the deal, the contracts would go to Cima+ (40 per cent), Genivar (27 per cent), Tecsult (22 per cent) and Dessau (11 per cent), Mr. Gelinas said.
According to Mr. Gelinas, Mr. Paulhus was one of his contacts at Genivar during bid-rigging discussions among engineers.
Another witness at the Charbonneau inquiry, engineer Patrice Mathieu, testified on Wednesday that a bid-rigging system also existed in the Quebec City region after 2004. He added that the federal government's multibillion-dollar infrastructure program was "manna" in the second half of the 2000s, when major firms were colluding to split public projects among themselves.
However, the Charbonneau inquiry's mandate does not go beyond municipal and provincial areas of jurisdiction in Quebec, so it cannot examine practices at the federal level, leaving unanswered questions about the possibility of collusion on federal contracts.
The inquiry is currently hearing from a police investigator who specializes in biker gangs, and next week will examine the links between union officials and members of organized crime in the construction industry.

Full text:   Plan to densify the Grandview-Woodlands area hinges on a series of residential towers
kgold@globeandmail.com
Commercial Drive is an old Vancouver working class neighbourhood where community street festivals are the norm and Grandview Park doubles on weekends as an informal flea market. It's the antithesis of Robson Street or Fourth Avenue, where consumerism rules.
But no neighbourhood is immune to change, and city planners have spent a large part of their year coming up with a community plan that will densify the Grandview-Woodlands area with a series of residential towers.
Community plans are under way for four Vancouver neighbourhoods. However, resident backlash against some of the proposals, particularly for towers, has been so fierce that on Sept. 24 the city will consider a motion to extend the consultation process by at least six months.
"We heard loud and clear from the community that they were concerned about the scale and height and extent of towers shown in the emerging direction we put out in June," says the city's assistant director of planning, Matt Shillito.
"We are now looking at alternative forms of density," he says. "I wouldn't say there won't be any towers in the revised plan, but the concern is the number of towers and height."
The decision to delay the plan worries a Commercial Drive non-profit group that is long overdue for an expansion that would include low-income housing and a rebuilt centre for their clientele. Bereft of government funding, the Kettle Friendship Society has formed a unique partnership with a local developer to fund expansion of their facility, at the northeast corner of Commercial and Venables.
The Society has 47 signatures on a petition so far, urging the city to make an exception and allow their application to go forward immediately.
Daniel Boffo, a young developer who wants to build a mid-size tower at the corner, is keenly aware of potential push back. He might have an appetite for challenge, with another controversial project proposed in the heart of the Downtown Eastside, a 29-unit market and non-market housing project at 555 Cordova.
The mixed use project he plans for Commercial Drive will take over the corner best known for Astorino's banquet hall. A residential tower there already fits with the city's community plan for more density, but it's unique in that Mr. Boffo's project will subsidize several units of non-market housing.
Mr. Boffo, who lives in the area, purchased several properties around the Kettle building and is working to acquire a city-owned parking lot to the north. When the community plan is completed, he will apply for rezoning. Mr. Boffo is hoping for a 15-storey tower on the site, which will have several buildings of varying scale.
"I think we are looking at 20 per cent non-market," says Mr. Boffo. "But it depends on what we can get on the density side, to be able to put residential, retail and an office component together. We are proposing 25 to 30 units [of non market], and we are hoping to target about 150 market units, give or take. It's all variable depending on how this process plays out."
They are also hammering out a plan that would take the 37-year-old Kettle facility from 7,000 square feet to 12,000 square feet.
"I would be thrilled if we got that," says Nancy Keough, the Kettle's executive director.
The society owns the existing building, a former egg factory, and started looking at expansion plans in 2006. Their neighbour Leo Astorino asked if they'd be interested in purchasing his building, but the society didn't have the resources.
"With government cuts, there was no money, even though we went to everybody with our plan," Ms. Keough said. "Then when Daniel bought Astorino's, and started talking to us about possibilities on the site, it was synchronistic."
Ms. Keough says that, gauging from reaction at open house meetings, residents are mostly positive.
"It's hard for people to get behind it until they really know what we are talking about," she says. "There were a couple of people who don't want any change at all."
Ms. Keough said the project's chief architect, Seattle-based Tom Kundig, played a key role in helping explain to residents how the Society would benefit from the plan. Mr. Kundig has worked in B.C. before, but he's just become acquainted with the Commercial Drive area.
He is no stranger to transitioning communities. It's become part of the job for urban architects. In Seattle, he's worked on mixed market-non-market housing projects, including a Lutheran church. Supporting non-market housing with for-profit housing is a workable model in a world of government cuts and expensive real estate, he says.
"Kettle is overbooked in a marginal facility. This will provide them with a better facility, more housing a more commodious gathering area - not only internally but externally," Mr. Kundig said on the phone from Seattle. "The courtyard would be like an urban courtyard and it will accommodate people from all walks of life - which is the strength of Commercial Drive because as a true urban centre, it represents the complete urban condition, rather than a sanitized version."
The Drive, which is part of Grandview-Woodlands, isn't the only neighbourhood getting ready for transformation. City staff are devising community plans for the Downtown Eastside, the West End and Marpole, looking at building heights, parks, public amenities, transportation and heritage issues within a 30-year framework. The idea is to move away from one-off rezoning.
There was major resident pushback against the proposal of towers ranging from 22 to 37 stories around the transit SkyTrain hub at Commercial and Broadway, which was revealed in June.
The more likely scenario for the major transit intersection is the development of mid-rise buildings, which are 10 to 12 stories. Mr. Shillito said the Boffo development might have to fall within that restriction.
"It would be more of a move to mid-rise form in that area as well," he said.
For his part, Mr. Kundig is just waiting for the city to tell him the rules. He'll also be sympathetic to the community when the project does get under way, knowing full well that any tower in the area has the potential to be a lightning rod.
"We have similar neighbourhoods here in Seattle and all over California," says Mr. Kundig. "Commercial Drive is a beloved neighbourhood, like a lot of those neighbourhoods are. They were ignored for a while, then had their own sort of character develop, and now it's changing. This is what architects and planners all have to deal with - every day it's a changing world.
"And I think the pressure in Vancouver is higher than even Seattle," he adds. "Vancouver is more like San Francisco, where it's unbelievable what's happening there with housing prices. You have that offshore money that's driving the inflation in Vancouver ... and it's absolutely impactful for a community.
"It really does have an effect on a community that's been born and raised there, and has developed the culture of a place. I wish I had the answer for how to deal with that."

Full text:   Input from residents can help architects create more livable neighbourhoods
For many architects, the community planning process can be a daunting one. The idea of design by committee, where hundreds of residents contribute their two-cents worth on new projects, can often produce dubious aesthetic results.
But for Vancouver architects Mark Ostry and Russell Acton, whose firm Acton/Ostry had to accommodate neighbourhood input on the proposed Rize Alliance project at Kingsway and Broadway in Mount Pleasant, the process was a unique kind of "crystallization" of community needs and concerns.
The process was often fraught, with the proposed mixed use tower and low-rise development in many ways a "guinea pig' for the new Mount Pleasant community plan introduced in 2010. As such it was the focal point for a broad range of concerns about affordability and livability and arguably faced increased public scrutiny in an area that now has several high-density, mixed-use projects in development.
Those include a new Aquilini project at Main and 2nd by Francl Architects that had its building, massing and public space redesigned after Mount Pleasant Implementation Committee input as well as a new nine-storey building by Arno Matis at Main and 7th.
In what has now become the norm for the area, The Beedie Group is beginning community outreach on their plans to densify and redevelop the early seventies era Kingsgate Mall years ahead of a likely rezoning application.
And Mr. Ostry himself - whose firm designed the Stella - a 13-storey high-rise that, since no rezoning was required, was erected in 2008 without much public fanfare a few hundred metres from the Rize Alliance site - is at work on another mixed use housing project for Edgar Development at 11th and Kingsway.
Still, despite the often heated city council meetings of early 2012, where the likes of groups like past mayoral candidate Randy Helton and his NSV (Neighbourhoods for a Sustainable Vancouver) movement voiced spirited opposition, Mr. Ostry feels that "the process made for a better project."
He admits to being frustrated at times by the public misconception that community input relates directly to architectural design. "That's not how it works," he explains, near his 8th Avenue office a few blocks from the Rize Alliance site. "The Community consultation stage for rezoning is really about massing, uses and density - not about design per se."
This did not stop concerned residents from offering architectural design suggestions before rezoning was approved in April, 2012. But when city council and Mount Pleasant community groups asked for significant changes to the original plans as part of the rezoning approval, Mr. Ostry found the design challenge a useful tool for improvement.
"It's a positive thing for an architect to have community engagement," says Mr. Ostry. "The more certainty there is around community values and desires the better."
"The process took us from focusing on a single project to looking deeper into the neighbourhood as a whole - and that helped us," says Rize Alliance VP of Development Christopher Vollan. Mr. Vollan has become something of an expert on Mount Pleasant's history - from Herbert Lee, who built the 1912 Lee Building as part of a plan to create Vancouver's "new downtown," through a mid-1970s mini development boom, and into its current and future transformation into a transit oriented high-density hub. Mr. Vollan, who plans to move from Gastown to Mount Pleasant in the near future, is enthusiastic about the area, noting local barbers, café owners and culturally significant buildings like the Goh Ballet school during an informal walkabout.
In an intensive year-long process that involved going "back to the drawing board" quite literally, Acton Ostry Architects reviewed community input and council comments and studied both the fine grain of Mount Pleasant and of neighbourhoods around the world.
The result is quite a different project than the somewhat Vancouverist traditional tower and podium originally planned. The architects looked to towns sited on hills around the world for inspiration. What they came up with was a more nuanced and richly textured approach to high density that reflects the neighbourhood character.
The massing and scale were broken down with a single building morphing into five different ones, and the architectural styles became more variegated. Each of the five structures that include three low-rises, town homes and a tower now better reflect the individual natures of the streets they face.
A central residential entrance on the Watson block side offers access to all buildings, and a sense of community is further engendered by a courtyard/green space designed by PWL Partnership Landscape Architects Inc. that offers gardens, public art and even hammocks. The tower itself - which had been the focal point of community concern (and was lowered substantially during the rezoning process) had its programming flipped with deletion of a second floor commercial space.
The texturing and colour of the tower were inspired by the abstract paintings of Linda Day and the photoconceptualist work of Emmanuel Buenviaje. The tower - at the acute end of a triangulated site with a "flatiron effect"- now shadows the site itself, offering shade for the inner courtyard and mitigating sunlight loss along Broadway.
The Broadway and Kingsway block seven-storey low-rises boast robust exteriors to buffer traffic noise, while the Watson street block low-rise reflects the bohemian feel of the lane-like street, with coloured screens breaking up massing, and balconies that open up into the public realm.
The two-storey town homes facing East 10th and its existing bicycle lane will benefit from a new public park. And a grove of trees planted on top of the tower's roof garden will beckon like a new civic beacon.
While the entire process has been exhaustive - and often exhausting - and must still pass final development approval - Mr. Ostry who has been involved for most of the seven-year journey - seems pleased with the results so far. Mr. Vollan hopes that if all goes to plan, ground will be broken by the spring of 2014.
"It's been a real lesson for me," says Mr. Ostry, "in how to take community angst about a project, and turn it into something design-positive."

STANLEY PARK AT 125

Abstract: Stanley Park also influenced Vancouver's unusual transportation infrastructure.

Full text:   As events to celebrate the 125th anniversary of Vancouver's Stanley Park begin this weekend, the author of a new book on the environmental history of the 400-hectare park looks at the singular influence it has had over the city and its citizens
Since its official opening nearly 125 years ago, Stanley Park has played an outsized role in the development of Vancouver. No other single landmark has had a greater influence on the shape of Vancouver, and no other urban park has played such a pivotal part in the emergence and development of a major city in Canada. The 400-hectare rainforest has even had a cameo on The Simpsons, in an episode when Bart and Lisa strolled past Lord Stanley's statue and the totem poles during their visit to Vancouver's 2010 Winter Olympic Games.
Vancouverites guard Stanley Park so jealously that it has become, as one newspaper editorial once put it years ago, "a fetish of untouchability." When windstorms ravaged the park in 2006 and 2007, hundreds of British Columbians opened their wallets to donate money to restore its fallen forest. B.C.'s wealthiest man, Jim Pattison, was moved to donate $1-million. In spite of the extraordinary cost and labour involved, the community rallied around the park and united to rebuild.
Stanley Park has long held that sort of power: to unite, to stir our emotions, and even to breed controversy. More often than not, however, the power of the park can be seen in its ability to shape neighbourhoods, influence transportation infrastructure, and inspire ideas about the place of nature in the city.
The West End, now one of the most densely settled residential areas in North America, owes much of its desirability and prestige to Stanley Park. When Arthur Wellington Ross, a real estate developer and close associate of the Canadian Pacific Railway corporation, suggested in 1886 that Vancouver city council should use the western peninsula near downtown as a public park, he did so with the hopes of transforming the nearby area into a prestigious new residential neighbourhood.
The West End emerged as Vancouver's first elite neighbourhood, and its influential residents strove to keep it that way by guarding Stanley Park. They enjoyed breathtaking views of the park and the North Shore Mountains from their Seaton Street (now Hastings) mansions. Throughout the early 20th century, they fought proposals for sawmills, electric streetcar routes and stadiums, all to protect the park that gave their neighbourhood its prestigious status. By the late 20th century, ordinary Vancouverites had inherited this extraordinary neighbourhood from the CPR executives and similarly resisted new developments that threatened its visual appeal, including protests in the 1970s against the construction of a Four Seasons hotel and apartment complex at the Georgia Street entrance to the park.
Stanley Park also influenced Vancouver's unusual transportation infrastructure. When North Shore property developers and suburban politicians approached Vancouver's city council in the mid-1920s with plans to build a bridge at First Narrows, Stanley Park once again found itself in the middle of a heated political battle that reshaped Vancouver and its region. Most Vancouver voters opposed the idea of building a First Narrows bridge because it would necessitate the construction of a highway through the middle of Stanley Park. As one Vancouverite wrote to a local newspaper regarding the proposal, "No vandalism must be permitted in Stanley Park, the wealth of which to the citizens of Vancouver is worth many bridges." In 1927, this sentiment won the day in a referendum that ultimately delayed the construction of the bridge.
By the early 1930s, economic conditions had changed. British Columbians were suffering the brutal consequences of the Great Depression. In 1933, during a moment of weakness, Vancouverites voted to approve the construction of a bridge and highway through Stanley Park. However, park engineers insisted that the roadway follow a gentle curve so as not to give the appearance that the park was severed in two.
Vancouver's downtown stands out from those of other North American cities because it has no freeways - in part, thanks to Stanley Park. Beginning in the late 1950s, city council and the provincial government drew up plans for an elaborate new high-speed freeway system and bridge to better link Vancouver with its burgeoning suburbs. The Park Board, with generous public support, stood firm in its opposition to the construction of a new bridge and freeway. As Park commissioner George Wainborn said, "We should make it plain that we shall not tolerate any more of the park being taken for a highway." The board's principled stand against another bridge at First Narrows forced city planners to bend their freeway plans around Stanley Park, ultimately resulting in new proposals to build the bridge across Coal Harbour. Planners never built a third bridge, and Vancouver voters eventually rejected the proposed freeway system. Instead, due to the desire to protect Stanley Park, they got the Seabus as a public transit option for crossing Burrard Inlet.
As much as it has shaped the development of the city, Stanley Park has also influenced the collective imagination about nature and history in Vancouver. In 1939, the Vancouver News-Herald claimed that the park was necessary because "a city that has been carved out of the forest should maintain somewhere within its boundaries evidence of what it once was, and so long as Stanley Park remains unspoiled, that testimony to the giant trees which occupied the site of Vancouver in former days will remain." Although Stanley Park's forest has been disturbed and changed in numerous ways over time, it continues to represent an imagined version of the past, which has allowed Vancouverites to reflect on their own history. The park stands as a living metaphor for Vancouver's origins and progress. It has become a temple of atonement for the environmental destruction that was necessary to build the city.
The decision to transform the small peninsula adjacent to downtown Vancouver into a public park in the late 19th century had numerous unforeseen consequences for the development of the city. As ideas about parks and nature changed over the course of the 20th century, the emotional attachment Vancouverites felt toward Stanley Park endowed the unassuming peninsula with tremendous political influence. By the end of the century, planners, engineers and politicians approached urban development in and around Stanley Park with extreme caution. The public outpouring over the storms of 2006 and 2007 further illustrate the influence of Stanley Park over Vancouver - a city whose history has been inextricably entangled in the history of its park.
Sean Kheraj is the author of the recently released book Inventing Stanley Park: An Environmental History, published by UBC Press.
He is also an assistant professor of Canadian environmental history at York University and the producer of the Canadian history podcast Nature's Past.

Full text:   In order to be competitive, Canada's cities need to attract talented people and offer opportunities for people to create businesses and be magnets for investment. Some communities are far from that ideal. So Shane Dingman put the question to notable Canadians: What big project, other than a casino, would you propose to revitalize a stagnant area? An indoor tropical resort was one suggestion
Scott McGillivray
Real estate investor, contractor, writer and host of HGTV Canada's series Income Property.
We're talking Canada right? I mean seriously, the hardest part of overcoming the tourism situation is the winter. Other than offering people skiing or skating or some sort of winter festival, it's all still cold and basically eliminates a big portion of the population. How much money do you think Canadians spend travelling to tropical places in the winter?
Why fly all the way to the Caribbean when we can just build the Caribbean here. Imagine a theme park, the size of Canada's Wonderland, but in a glass dome. You don't put in roller coasters, you put in palm trees; it's large enough to be a full-on resort. It's total vacation ... within the city. The Pleasuredome.
You could have an indoor beach, a man-made lake with salt-water controls. Its somewhere you can stay, you can go outside in your shorts. It's about having an escape from the environment and the reality of the city. It could have a running track - think of all the people who like to go running but all winter you're stuck running in the slush and the snow.
It's a special entertainment zone, where all-inclusive rules exist: It has its own unique liquor license, like an open-bar concept with one set price, just like a beach resort.
It doesn't need a lot of energy [for heat]; you're basically creating the greenhouse effect with the glass roof. This would be the Truman Show of domes, maybe two Sky Domes [stadiums] worth. That's doable.
The dome is a critical element. Now, I don't know if you're ready for this ... but there is another option. You could theoretically launch a satellite that has a large reflective surface, and is constantly reflecting the sun at this point so that it's always daytime. It doubles the amount of sunshine coming in the winter. You could have sunshine until midnight all year round. I think I saw it on Discovery Channel once. Well, maybe it was on the Simpsons I saw it, not the Discovery Channel.
Think about how many people go on these vacations and they have to travel so far... This is all the conveniences of home with all the pleasure of the Caribbean holiday. I dream I live in this place.

We need to start by taking stock of the breakthrough technology being developed in Canada, where we have the potential to be global leaders, whether that's mobile technology or quantum computing or something else altogether. Then we need to double-down on the development of that technology, supporting our innovators through failure and success, setting audacious goals and delivering radical, world-leading innovation.
World-class talent is also a key ingredient. The highly-skilled people who will take on these breakthrough challenges will be drawn to dynamic cities that have an electricity of opportunity running through the air. To be competitive, our cities need to think of transit, greenspace planning, bike-friendly commutes and other community-building projects as key investments toward attracting and retaining creative, young innovators from Canada and around the world.

Public broadband is a necessity
Dan Mathieson
In his third term as mayor of Stratford, Ont., and recipient of Canadian Advanced Technology Alliance's techn innovator medal.
The use of broadband connectivity needs to be treated as a basic infrastructure need.
In the future economy, the data that flows across those networks is going to become part of everyday life, if it hasn't already. If you can't entice commercial entities to do it, then government should look at how they can play a role in advancing public broadband.
In our case, we used a fibre optic network that we had in the city as a backhaul for our utility data, that helped to create a business model that made it more inviting for corporate entities that wanted to come in. It helped us on a number of fronts: It attracted the University of Waterloo's significant investment with regards to their digital media campus in Stratford; The Royal Bank of Canada built a national data centre in Stratford; and we are fostering the growth of technology companies at Stratford Accelerator Centre ... Their underlying need will be connectivity going forward and it's important that we have it.
We've also tried to make sure the existing manufacturers - automotive, aerospace and others - are using the broadband for their quality control. We have one company hooked right into one of the largest auto makers in the world with regard to outputs and just-in-time delivery, and it helps.
You have to continue to market yourself as a destination. If people have an ability to work anywhere, they can look at Stratford for its quality of life and its ability to give them some things they wouldn't get in a larger centre while not leaving them at an economic disadvantage. I think those are the leading premises that you have to operate under.
I think if we're not careful and we don't advance connectivity in communities of all sizes, we're going to see the further erosion of small rural communities. We need to make sure that communities don't lose the opportunity for employment, for skilled workers within those areas.
Free basic Internet service for every resident, business or visitor of our city - making sure there is no socio-economic barrier to access - is something that can happen, and possibly will happen, as we plan the next phase of our expansion.

Exploit the potential of the food business
Ilse Treurnicht
CEO of MaRS Discovery District, heading up the mandate to create successful global businesses from Canada's science, technology and social innovation sectors for eight years.
Food is a huge opportunity for Canadian communities, and a huge need in the world.
We have a trade deficit in processed food, we import more than we export, and that's something we can easily turn around. Why should I be buying my soy milk in a carton coming from somewhere in the U.S.?
One of the challenges about Canada is that it's a large country with low density in population, so food is attractive because we have so much land that [operations] can be scaled up and down. What you can do around food production, food distribution, food processing is develop economic growth locally and potentially build an economy that can serve other surrounding communities or export communities.
I have to tell you it was a bit of a surprise to me when I started to look at the number of people employed in the food processing sector in the GTA, which you don't normally think of as a food Mecca until you realize it's a huge part of the economy.
There are a large number of very high-growth businesses that are providing food services locally, such as the entrepreneur from Freshii. It's becoming more and more innovative, and there's an opportunity to tap into the diversity of our population. A lot of really interesting companies prototype products for global markets locally, and build very successful export products based on what they process here.
These are not projects that can be led by any one group: Government plays a role in creating an enabling environment that makes it easy for people to start businesses, to operate, to attract talent, to get skilled labour. We're believers that the impact of these networks become much more significant and amplified if you have the collaboration of business innovators, of government and of local community leadership, and, critically, partnership with the educational institutions from high schools all the way to postsecondary institutions.

Think big to fill holes in big cities
John Stanton
The founder of The Running Room and Walking Room is also the author of several books.
The first thing that jumps to my mind when you think of Canada are what are the successful things that are good for the community and economic and social and cultural development in cities.
I'm thinking in Halifax there's the Bluenose [historic ship] and buskers and what happens there.
When you think of Quebec City, you think of Winter Carnival.
If you think of Ottawa, it's probably Canada Day on Parliament Hill.
If you think of Edmonton, it's the Fringe Festival that happens in the park.
If you think of Vancouver, it's something that happens in Stanley Park.
All of these things involve public space that's accessible and affordable. They involve engagement of the population as a whole and entertainment that's affordable, in most cases.
Every major city in Canada has a derelict area where land values are not there because commercial development is not happening.
Building a stadium is pretty limited because they target sports and concerts, but something where you have affordable green space downtown is for the whole community.
Look at Toronto's Caribana [Caribbean carnival]. It started off as an ethnic segment and is now a Toronto celebration.
Events like that could be expanded if turned loose in big green spaces.
[Planning] needs to be more grandiose, like the encapsulation of the whole waterfront. You can have big concerts and events [that are] accessible.
In Winnipeg, they've been struggling to rebuild downtown. It's partially there - you've got the Aspers who have funded this new museum [of human rights] at The Forks [historic and recreation] area.
Make it big: areas where you could have concerts, fireworks and festivals, along with other downtown amenities.
These answers have been edited and condensed.

Full text:   Entrepreneurs win acclaim with their greenhouse atop a commercial building in Montreal. But starting a farm in the sky is more difficult than you'd think
Nothing's more down to earth than farming, but a new urban farm in Montreal is inspiring designers to think of growing in the clouds.
Lufa Farms, on the roof of a commercial building near Montreal's Marché Centrale, is a 32,000-square-foot hydroponic greenhouse that's producing more than 453 kilograms of vegetables every day, all year round.
With demand growing for local produce and a shortage of open fields in urban areas, the concept is attractive. But Lufa Farms founder Mohamed Hage has found that it is way more complicated to be a rooftop farmer than setting up a glass house and planting seeds.
It took him five years just to find a suitable building, convince the owner and the city building department to allow it, and to design and build it. And it took an investment of almost $2-million to get it off the ground and into production.
But it's an example that is inspiring other rooftop farms, says Aaron Quesnel, founder of Sky Harvest Inc., a startup in Vancouver that's also planning a rooftop greenhouse farm.
While roofs represent as much as 30 per cent of the surface areas of major cities, only about 10 per cent of commercial rooftops in Canada could support the weight of a greenhouse farm, Mr. Quesnel says.
In a study of urban farming Mr. Quesnel co-authored while a student at a technical institute in Sweden, he found that even those buildings whose roofs can carry the load are often off limits because they're already built to the maximum height for their zoning.
But he sees great potential for using what's basically wasted space at this point. "In cities where you have astronomical real estate costs it makes increasing sense to use this amazing resource," he says. Growing locally is also preferable because of the monetary and environmental costs of shipping food long distances.
Sky Harvest has been doing engineering studies on a number of buildings but has yet to choose the site of its first greenhouse in Vancouver. "Every building is different, so you can spend a lot of time doing engineering assessment only to find out it's not feasible. While some buildings could be retrofitted to bear the load, in most cases that's not economically viable," Mr. Quesnel says.
The rooftop farming movement is being pioneered in Montreal and New York. He knows of groups in Calgary, Boston, New York and Seattle as well as abroad in London that are looking at rooftop farms.
"The costs are still relatively high but as worries grow about the risk of the sustainability of the food-supply chain it will become more of a trend," Mr. Quesnel predicts.
Sky Harvest co-owner Dirk Gibbs says he's found there is a great deal of investor interest in funding rooftop farms. That's important because the development costs add up even before a site is chosen.
With a farm on the ground, it's relatively easy to begin cultivating. But the costs of doing engineering studies on rooftops, for example, can be astronomical even before you start installing equipment, Mr. Gibbs explains.
"There are very few ideal spaces in a city. You need to have a roof built with materials that are designed to carry at least 10 per cent more weight, depending on where water and crops are stored." Construction costs can also go beyond the fabrication and lifting of components onto a roof that may be in a crowded urban area. Building codes for workplaces generally require more than one exit, and the tops of commercial buildings are designed for machinery and don't often have elevator access for moving people and equipment to the greenhouse, Mr. Gibbs notes.
As greenhouse roofs become more mainstream, new buildings will be engineered to accommodate the trend, he predicts.
One under-utilized source of strong roofs is parking structures, which are built to hold the weight of cars and trucks. One community garden in Seattle has set up on the roof of a parking garage, he adds.
The urban farm concept is different from existing attempts to grow vegetables on "green roofs," Mr. Hage explains. Being in operation year-round, a hydroponic greenhouse on a roof provides environmental benefits of cooling a building in the summer and holding in heat in the winter.
The green pluses include being able to grow with natural pest control, such as using ladybugs to eat aphids.
Lufa Farms' glass enclosure produces 40 types of vegetables and herbs in a variety of growing media, moisture and lighting conditions. There are two macro-zones and several micro-zones. Tomatoes, for instance, grow best in the sunny south-facing part of the greenhouse while lettuce does better in the cooler, northern portion of the roof.
Crops are harvested each day by six employees. The produce is boxed and taken to pick-up points for customers who have pre-ordered custom selections of vegetables. (A small basket suitable for one or two people is priced at $22, and a large one suited for three or more sells for $44.) So far, demand for the produce is growing faster than supply. Mr. Hage says the company hopes to open two more greenhouses, another in downtown Montreal and one in Laval, Que.
"This is an idea whose time has come," Mr. Hage says. "Big cities like Montreal, Toronto and Ottawa are basically food deserts; most of the year you can't find locally grown sustainable food and we have to rely on imports."

Full text:   For most of the year, Chester, N.S., is a quiet village of 1,300 that centres mostly on heritage and tourism.
Over the next few days, it will be the scene of an impassioned, if picturesque, battle.
The Chester Race Week sees 130 boats converge from around North America to compete in what is billed as Canada's largest keelboat regatta. Sailors are drawn by the world-class competition, the reliable winds of Mahone Bay and its spectacular setting.
During race week, which ends Saturday, the town will swell by 2,000 people - and about $800,000 and $900,000 will be injected into its economy.
Not that it's desperate for the cash, exactly. Chester is a wealthy village on Nova Scotia's south shore - a summer playground for multimillionaires, including philanthropist Sir Christopher Ondaatje, who owns an island that looks out on to Chester's front harbour. Then there's lobster billionaire John Risley, whose home is believed to have 16 bathrooms.
Among the summer houses, there is one for sale for $2-million - and it doesn't have central heating.
But beyond the riches, the town and the races are steeped in history: Chester was founded in in 1759, and the race began in 1856 - it has since survived world wars and deep depressions. There are 13 classes of boats, including the Bluenose class, sailboats designed at end of the Second World War by Halifax naval architect William Roué.
Around town, the joke is that real estate and landscaping are Chester's biggest industries, as the population grows from about 1,300 in the winter to 2,500 in the summer. Rich Haligonians relocate to the shore along with Ontarians and many Americans, such as the Wurtses, whose family fortune was made in coal and steel in western Pennsylvania.
Father and son John and Topher Wurts are the fourth and fifth generation of the Wurts family from Philadelphia to spend their summers in Chester; they race Hayseed, an elegant wooden sailboat with a checkered past, acquired by John's grandmother in 1924. Her Halifax owner lost interest in her and left her on a nearby Chester beach after he won it all in what sailors called a "blood money" match - a hugely serious best-of-seven series - against a similar sailboat.
This week, Topher, 46, is the crew's tactician on the 101-year-old boat as it competes during four days of racing at Chester Race Week. John, 77, is racing against his son - skippering Virginia, the equally beautiful but smaller and younger sister of Hayseed.
"We hate each other's guts," jokes John, whose sailing stories are told with a salty tongue.
No money goes to the winners.
"They win trophies and bragging rights. People will spend tens of thousands of dollars to win a five-dollar cup," says Chester Yacht Club commodore Randy Stevens, adding: "Some of it is a bit of a debauchery."
The rum does flow at the local hot spots - the Fo'c'sle tavern and the Rope Loft - and there are even stories (though some locals say they are apocryphal), of empty champagne bottles bobbing in the front harbour after a night of partying.
"I always thought of it being like the Christmas of the summer," says Brookes Diamond, who owns an entertainment company in Halifax and is a long-time summer resident of Chester. He competed in race week for 30 years, sailing on High Tide, a yacht built in the 1930s. He owned it with seven other people and stopped sailing it in 2000.
He called what he does "social racing."
"In our particular case, it was something of a party boat," he says. "But we did try. We certainly did give it our best shot."
For several years, Mr. Diamond recalls that he and his fellow sailors were barred from discussing yacht racing at the Fo'c'sle because the stories of who won and who lost over the years became "so frequent and so loud." Some say the debauchery has toned down over the past 15 years, but a few Chesterites still escape their village for race week.
Not Rick Foster, however. The real-estate agent, who owns a home in Chester, is not a sailor but takes his Boston Whaler out to the start line, anchors there and watches the crews set the sails and work the ropes for the best start. "There are three or four different starts in sequence and depending on the wind, it is every exciting to see who is first over the line when the gun sounds."
John Curry, a retired surgeon from Halifax, has been chairman of race week for several years. This will likely be his last, giving him time to get back into the racing.
He first competed in 1954, racing on the Chester C-class sloop, Ripple, now owned by Christopher Ondaatje. Although Sir Christopher is on a river cruise on the Danube, his boat will be competing, sailing against the Hayseed and Virginia in the 14-boat Classic class.
Topher Wurts has a passion for the Classic class boats - and hopes to save these old, elegant wooden yachts from being chopped up (partly because they are so expensive to maintain). He saved Virginia, buying it from a non-profit organization in San Diego that was closing its doors. He put together a consortium to buy Seneca, a 1907 sloop by Nathanael Herreshoff, a world-renowned sailboat designer.
In 1974, his mother sold Hayseed to a Haligonian, and by the late 1980s it was beached. Topher found it in 1998 - and rallied his family to buy it for $30,000.
"The Hayseed has been a member of the Wurts family for five generations, so you learn to take care and love this lady, and those of her kind," he says. "It's a bit quixotic, but these ladies can fly, too. It's easy to love them when they love you back."

Full text:   Strong summer numbers have economists wondering whether further steps will be taken to stem rising prices and consumer debt
REAL ESTATE REPORTER
The surprising resilience of the country's housing market is renewing concerns that it could be overshooting.
Housing starts, sales and prices are once again defying expectations, one year after Finance Minister Jim Flaherty shocked the market with tighter mortgage insurance rules. The sector is showing such strength this summer that some economists are wondering whether Mr. Flaherty will go further in a bid to stem rising house prices and consumer debt levels.
"There may be some dusting off of potential measures to cool housing," Bank of Montreal economist Douglas Porter wrote in a research note. He thinks the market could be on the verge of running away again.
Both Mr. Flaherty and economists will have a better sense of where things stand on Thursday, when the Canadian Real Estate Association releases July's sales figures. Mr. Porter thinks the data will show that the number of existing homes changing hands is 10 per cent higher than this time last year, which would mean that they are "within striking distance of the record highs hit in 2007."
July data from some local real estate boards appear to back that assumption. Vancouver, for instance, saw a whopping 40.4-per-cent year-over-year increase in sales of existing homes over the Multiple Listing Service, while Toronto posted a still-impressive 16-per-cent gain. Calgary's sales were up 17 per cent from last year. (Not all markets are showing gains. Ottawa and Montreal each saw sales fall by about 2 per cent year-over-year).
Toronto-Dominion Bank economist Diana Petramala says that sales have now recovered from the changes that Mr. Flaherty made to the mortgage insurance rules. "In Vancouver, sales have recovered to their highest level since 2010," she notes.
In addition to the changes that Ottawa made to the rules for consumers, such as cutting the maximum length of an insured mortgage to 25 years and doing away with mortgage insurance for homes worth more than $1-million, Mr. Flaherty has been taking steps to curtail the degree to which Canada Housing and Mortgage Corp., and therefore taxpayers, backstop the banks' activities. He has been worried that ultralow mortgage rates are adding too much fuel to the housing fire.
It's possible that the market's current strength is temporary.
Real estate associations and some economists wonder whether the strong sales in June and July were spurred by mortgage rates ticking up, prompting consumers to jump into the market before they rise further. The special five-year closed rate has risen 60 basis points since mid-June, and "homebuyers with a preapproved mortgage are likely jumping into the market to take advantage of record low interest rates," Ms. Petramala wrote in a research note. (A basis point is 1/100th of a percentage point.)
One part of the market that isn't rebounding yet is newly constructed homes. Sales of new condos in Toronto were down 18 per cent from a year ago in the second-quarter, Urbanation, which tracks the Toronto condo market, said last week. And the amount of residential land that developers bought to build houses and condos fell 51 per cent in Toronto, 30 per cent in Vancouver, and 52 per cent in Calgary during the first half of this year, according to RealNet Canada Inc. Developers continue to build an abundance of new houses and condos, even though TD economist Dina Ignjatovic believes there is an oversupply of 250,000 new homes, roughly one year's worth, that will hit the market in the next two years.
For now, house prices are on an upward trajectory that could reignite talk of a bubble. "After flirting with outright declines for much of 2012 and earlier this year, average home prices were up almost 5 per cent year-over-year in June, and we suspect the gain was closer to 6 per cent for July, the fastest pace in almost two years," Mr. Porter wrote.

Full text:   Designer says changes to Point Grey Road means homes no longer have to turn their backs to the street
While the new bike lane project on Point Grey Road has caused controversy from a municipal planning perspective, there's been little discussion about how it might affect new residential design in the area.
One of the city's oldest residential neighbourhoods, it is now home to some of Canada's most expensive waterfront properties.
The area had a reputation for being conservative - both in a social and a design sense - until a 1960s intervention by architect Arthur Erickson that inserted two modernist town homes on the north side of Point Grey Road.
Their orientation to the south, facing the street, broke with tradition, as most homes to that point had faced north to take in the view of sea and mountains. The project was also the area's first multiunit development. Traffic noise was mitigated by a garage, which acted as a buffer to an inner courtyard garden that lead to the actual residential area.
In the late 1990s, Patkau Architects added the concrete Shaw House to the street; it has become a favourite pilgrimage site of archiphiles and students of architecture.
The newer villas have opted for copied south-facing façades, effectively walled off to the busy street. That tradition continues with a villa for Lululemon billionaire Chip Wilson designed by Russell Hollingsworth.
But some observers say the soon to be pedestrian and cycle friendly Point Grey Road presents an opportunity for cutting-edge use of public space that could liberate its residential design.
Vancouver architect Tony Robins, currently designing two houses on adjoining lots on Point Grey Road, says less traffic will be a design positive factor.
"Instead of the traditional walled off south-facing area, new residential design can now be opened up into more street friendly glazing and landscaping," he says.
Since council voted in favour of the new bike lanes, he's been able to alter his own designs for the two new modernist homes.
"A large façade deflecting noise has gone and the windows now face the street. The deck is also open to the street and a planned white-noise-producing water feature is no longer necessary," he explains.
Previously, buildings turned their backs on the traffic noise, he notes, "meaning turning away from the street and therefore symbolically the 'community,' and focusing on the view and privacy."
The design required to solve the sound issue, he contends, resulted in a sense of alienation, with "blank walls and no sense of occupancy."
The new plan for Point Grey Road "allows for more windows and a possible street aspect to the frontage. It also increases the livability of the homes by providing south sun, all day."
In addition, he notes that the tight road width and small front yards have meant "a dangerous need to 'back out' for these houses."
For his own Point Grey Road project, a planned "car turning circle" to allow cars to enter the property and leave it facing forward, has now been eliminated.
"I have heard that the only problem living in the area," says Mr. Robins, "is the lack of community."
He hopes that allowing both sides of the street to share more of the urban space outside their homes, "instead of it being a manic thoroughfare for cars," will help alleviate this sense of isolation.
Scot Hein - a planner at city hall - agrees.
"There are opportunities to open up edges on the north side of the street - humanizing and normalizing Point Grey Road. The more pedestrian friendly the street the better the relationship between streetscape and house."
"When houses don't back onto the street," notes Mr. Hein, "you get more ambient light spilling from residences onto public domains - and a safer and surveillable environment."
In many ways, the area is already on the vanguard of forward-thinking, public-space design - as it is distinguished by "pocket parks" that have ensured a public green space and waterfront view corridor.
While some critics of the new bike lane have made it out to be a private enclave for the rich, Mr. Robins sees it as a vehicle for crossing class lines - effectively uniting wealthy property owners with city cyclists and local pedestrians.
As for his own post-council decision redesign, he notes, "Architecture responds to the whims of such things, such changes of the rules" and says they can even be inspiring.
"Architects complain they are not free to do what they really want to do in Vancouver," he relates, "but as James Stirling once said about L.A., 'I can't design a building there, there are no constraints.' We thrive on nuances of the codes. Here's a new one that makes the architecture there change for everyone's benefit. Now the houses on the north side face two sides, the multimillion-dollar view and Kitsilano."

Maybe you're into homesteading and want to live gently on the land while farming it. Or you've inherited some acreage that you're going to develop ... slowly. Perhaps cottage guests have become bountiful - lucky you - and you need a bunkhouse. Maybe an art or yoga studio is in your future.
A yurt, says Patrick Ladisa, can fill the bill for all of these.
A decade ago, says Mr. Ladisa, president of all-Canadian yurt-maker Yurta.ca, the Mongolian-inspired, sturdy-yet-collapsible tents usually were sold to "hard-core," live-off-the-grid types who would throw them up, light their woodstoves and let their beards grow. He notes that more recently, however, yurts are more likely to arrive at the cottage in the back of a minivan (yes, they fit), where, in a couple of hours, they're ready to perform as extra bedrooms, meditation huts or swim-shacks by the water's edge.
"The sky kind of is the limit," boasts Mr. Ladisa. "What would you do with 226 square feet of totally portable, year-round, load-bearing shelter?"
There's something about these little structures, it seems, that appeals to both sets of people. Maybe it's the lack of corners, which soothes grizzled counterculture souls and soccer moms alike, or the fact that they're much larger than they seem.
While even the 5.2-metre (17-feet) diameter Yurta looks quaint and Lilliputian at 50 paces, inside is a different story: Illuminated from an operable acrylic dome overhead and sets of big zippered windows, the room feels wonderfully spacious. The absence of a vanishing point has something to do with this - think of infinity walls used by photographers - but the quality of light contributes as well: Diffused and softened by the dome, it falls onto the soft, felt walls and warm, ash lattice frame evenly and gently. With no harsh shadows or corners, a sense of quiet, of peace, is easy to achieve.
Perhaps this is a physical manifestation of the love that has gone into the Yurta design, which was first developed a decade ago by Anissa Szeto and Marcin Padlewski in the Ottawa area, then refined in the hamlet of Greenwood, Ont., just north of Pickering, where the company is located today. While some have Westernized their yurts by adding sliding glass windows, steel doors and a vinyl outer shell, and others have taken the easy route of importing product straight from Mongolia, the Yurta crew, says Mr. Ladisa, "do everything in the exact opposite way of North American yurt-makers."
For starters, they use as many natural materials as possible, such as the breathable, cotton-duck canvas walls that allow moisture to escape (these are sewn at the little coach house in Greenwood). They've engineered a unique way for the latticework frame to lock into place, and they've developed their own metal connector pieces rather than MacGyvering something from the big-box hardware store. They've kept true to the "nomadic tradition" by ensuring the user can "put this up without turning a screw or hammering a nail," says Mr. Ladisa.
Most important, however, Yurta employs only local sub-trades, such as the Spencerville- and Oshawa-based carpenters who make the doors, and they use only Canadian-made parts. Well, almost: "Everything that you see in this yurt is sourced between here and Ottawa, with one exception, and that's our zippers: We can't find a good-quality zipper in Canada."
This means, of course, that there are cheaper yurts on the market, but Mr. Ladisa isn't about to cave and sign on with a Chinese manufacturer: "Can we make it the same quality?" he asks rhetorically. "That's not the point of what we're doing."
The smaller, 3.9-metre diameter Yurta starts at just under $7,000. Moving to the larger 5.2-metre model with seven-foot-high walls (the company also offers six-foot-high walls) and adding full insulation brings the price to about $12,500.
While this may seem like a lot of money for what is, essentially, just a tent, there is no reason that owners can't expect a few decades of service, says Mr. Ladisa - provided, of course, that they don't abuse it and they don't mind shelling out for a new outer shell in about 10 years. "We think these are the best fabrics available, but they're the one thing that won't last," he admits.
For a shelter that's quick to erect, easy on the eyes, and supplies a tonic for concrete-and-steel hardened psyches, maybe it's downright cheap. Also, there's something appealing about owning a hut that you can pack up and move elsewhere if the mood strikes - or the economy tanks.
"There's something about this space that really is different from the traditional square room that we've all grown up in," says Mr. Ladisa.
"It's a nice way to get back to the land."

Full text:   Media reporter Steve Ladurantaye looks at the surprising sale of The Washington Post to Amazon's Jeff Bezos - and what it could mean to an industry in decline
THE HISTORY
The Post's Watergate coverage catapulted it to the top of the world's newspapers
When people imagine how a newspaper works, their first thoughts are likely of The Washington Post, circa 1976, when Dustin Hoffman and Robert Redford stomped around its newsroom in All The President's Men . The movie about the Post's uncovering of the Watergate scandal - which led to the resignation of then-president Richard Nixon in 1974 - brought newsrooms into the popular imagination in a way that had never happened before.
The paper was founded in 1877 with an initial circulation of 10,000 by Stilson Hutchins, who made his way to the nation's capital from Missouri to start a paper to support the Democratic Party. Its early days were overtly political - when Republican Rutherford Hayes won the presidency over Samuel Tilden in a hugely contested election, the paper went out of its way to avoid referring to him as the president.
Its first ownership change came in 1889, when it was sold for $210,000 to a newspaperman and a former member of the House of Representatives. A company history written by the International Directory of Company Histories says the paper was earning about $100,000 a year profit through the end of the century.
When those owners died, the paper was handed to John R. McLean, who broadened its scope away from politics and toward more general-interest stories. His son Edward would own the paper next, but drove it into bankruptcy in 1933 following a series of scandals that chipped away at the paper's credibility.
Eugene Meyer, a New York banker, bought it at an auction for $825,000 and staffed up, and in 1948 handed it to his daughter Katharine Graham and her husband Philip Graham after Mr. Meyer was appointed president of the World Bank by President Harry Truman.
The Grahams would become synonymous with the paper, also buying Newsweek and helping to build a national wire service. The company was thrust into disarray when Mr. Graham killed himself in 1963, but after his death, Katharine took over.
The 1970s saw the paper gain a place at the top of the world's journalism industry. It joined with The New York Times in publishing the Pentagon Papers, a secret government history of the Vietnam war. And in 1972, it would break the Watergate burglary story that is still seen as one of the most powerful examples of the power of the press.
The company had also gone public, raising $33-million in an initial public offering that ensured the Graham family remained in control of the publishing empire. That paved the way for Katharine's son Donald Graham to take over in 1991 after decades of steady profit, although diminishing returns would mean eventually selling to an Internet pioneer whose fortune was built in a business that would be impossible to imagine in 1889.
Jeff Bezos bought the Post this week for $250-million (U.S).
*****
THE PROBLEMS
Like the rest of the U.S. newspaper industry, circulation and print advertising have been in decline
Like newspapers around the world, The Washington Post has seen a drastic decline in the amount of print advertising it is selling. In its last quarter, profit dropped 14 per cent across the company and its many divisions, with the paper itself said to be losing about $60-million a year.
Circulation has also been a problem, with the number of subscribers down an estimated 7 per cent in the first six months of this year to just under 450,000 on weekdays and closer to 650,000 on the weekend. In 2002, The Washington Post's paid weekday circulation averaged almost 768,000 copies.
It has tried to make up for declines in print advertising by charging readers to access its content online. The paywall allows visitors a handful of free articles a month, but then asks them for money if they want to read more. The company hasn't disclosed its subscription totals, but a similar initiative from The New York Times has seen 699,000 activations and helped the publisher stem some of its losses on the print side.
The U.S. newspaper industry has been one of the hardest hit in the world. The Pew Research Centre for Excellence in Journalism estimates that employment in newsrooms across the country has dropped by 30 per cent since 2000. Print advertising fell by $1.8-billion in the last year alone, an 8.5-per-cent drop that took place even as the broader economy began to show signs of growth.
Newspapers have raced to build digital replacements for their once-lucrative print editions, and digital advertising has been expanding to the point that it now accounts for 15 per cent of a typical paper's revenue. But the economics simply don't work for the large papers - Pew believes that for every $15 the papers are losing in print, they are only making up $1 from digital ads.
"Even as volume improves, prices are depressed because of the huge range of places to advertise, now including social sites like Facebook and Twitter," its most recent health-of-the-industry report stated. "Though the great majority of newspaper organizations are profitable on an operating basis, many companies continue to struggle with debt and pension obligations assumed in better times."
Prior to buying the Post, Mr. Bezos casually suggested that readers would never pay for online content because they were used to getting it for free. His tone seems to have softened, as he acknowledges the problems facing the industry.
"The Internet is transforming almost every element of the news business: shortening news cycles, eroding long-reliable revenue sources, and enabling new kinds of competition, some of which bear little or no news-gathering costs," he wrote to Post employees. "We will need to invent, which means we'll need to experiment."
*****
THE OPPORTUNITY
Can newspapers be saved by owners like Bezos, with deep pockets and reputations for innovation?
Despite the challenges, a new class of investor appears to be investing in U.S. newspapers. These owners have deep pockets, and are a throwback to the early days of print when rich industrialists controlled the press in order to push their political agendas.
Boston Red Sox owner John Henry just bought the venerable Boston Globe from the New York Times Co. for $70-million, a fraction of the $1.1-billion the Times paid for the paper in 1993, returning the paper to local ownership. And billionaire investor Warren Buffett has been snapping up small local papers for a couple of years now, based on his belief that they are uniquely positioned to serve their citizens in a way national media simply cannot.
Mr. Buffett paid about $2-million each for the dozens of papers he acquired (or as one analyst noted, the price of a nice house in each of those cities). The low selling prices reflect the uncertainty facing the industry, but also present a chance for new owners to step in without the heavy debt loads that once characterized such deals.
There haven't been many Canadian sales since an 85-per-cent stake in The Globe and Mail was sold to the Thomson family's Woodbridge Co. Ltd. for an undisclosed amount in 2010. There was one major transaction - Postmedia Network Inc. sold the Victoria Times Colonist, two other daily papers, dozens of weeklies and all of their related real estate to Glacier Media Inc. in 2011 for about $85-million.
In Mr. Bezos, the newspaper industry is getting an online pioneer who has invented business models and isn't sentimentally attached to the paper he now controls. Henry Blodget, chief executive officer and editor of the Business Insider website that Mr. Bezos has helped fund, wrote that the Amazon executive already understands subscription businesses and could be looking to package the Post's news with its Kindle e-readers. He could also be looking at newspapers as an established delivery system that could help Amazon get goods to consumers quicker.
Mr. Bezos hasn't provided a lot of insight to his thinking just yet, other than to say he'd give the newsroom's 650 journalists a one-year reprieve from layoffs as he figures things out. For veterans such as the Watergate-scooping Bob Woodward, that's as good a promise as they've heard in years.
"Jeff Bezos seems to me exactly the kind of inventive and innovative choice needed to bring about a recommitment to great journalism on the scale many of us have been hoping for - while employing all the applicable tools and best sensibilities of a new era and the old," he wrote. "The Washington Post is the ideal place for it to happen."
If it does, writes James Fallows in The Atlantic, it could spark a renaissance in journalism. "So let us hope that this is what the sale signifies: the beginning of a phase in which this Gilded Age's major beneficiaries re-invest in the infrastructure of our public intelligence," he wrote. "We hope it marks a beginning, because we know it marks an end."

CORRECTION: A Monday Folio story incorrectly stated that Amazon went public in 1994. The company was founded in 1994 and went public in 1997.

Ballantry Homes is looking to make the most of rarity: In Oakville, where single-family estates dominate the housing market, its Neighbourhoods of Oak Park is the only development offering an urban condominium lifestyle with bungalow-style townhouses.
"Right now, the most popular product on the market is the stacked townhouse and it's definitely nowhere near a stack," says director, Mark Lawrence. "As far as I'm aware, no one has this."
A series of brick and stucco structures will be composed of one-storey units with one- and two-bedroom plans, including ground-floor models with direct access to private garages and upper units accessible via common corridors and staircases.
"One of the problems with today's townhouses is that they're 13- or 16-feet wide with three or four floors, which is really difficult to live in," Mr. Lawrence said.
"We designed the townhouses as one-floor living, so if you live on the third floor, for example, you walk up two flights of stairs to your unit where everything is all on one level. So there won't be that constant up and down, plus it allows us to be able to widen rooms ... [without] a 3 1/2-foot-wide staircase to fit in there too."
Buyers can select from more conventional suites in a four-storey mid-rise called The Renaissance, which will round out the nearly 300-unit, master-planned community on Oak Park Boulevard and Taunton Road.
"We opened in April and really managed to kill the market: We had 162 sales between the two products," says Mr. Lawrence, who notes a majority of buyers are locals or residents of nearby Burlington and Brampton.
"There are a few people from downtown [Toronto] actually looking at this and thinking they can buy something for $350 a foot here or downtown at $600 a foot."
Along Oak Park Boulevard, The Renaissance will display a Greek revival-style façade containing one- and two-bedroom units with or without dens, open entertaining areas and balconies, plus a locker and underground parking.
Interior appointments for these suites will be upscale with nine-foot ceilings and flooring covered in ceramic, laminate or broadloom, as well as spa-like ensuite bathrooms and U-shaped kitchens with designer cabinetry and stainless steel appliances.
Should residents need more room to roam, there will be a rooftop terrace with lounging, dining and barbecuing areas and street-level retail outlets, in addition to parks, recreation facilities and restaurants nearby.
"Everything around it is already established, so there is shopping, theatres, liquor store and beer store," Mr. Lawrence added.
Monthly fees will be 30 cents per square foot for suites and $150 flat for townhouse units.
Occupancy will begin at the end of 2014 through to 2015.

Full text:   REAL ESTATE REPORTER
Foreign investors are increasingly snapping up stakes in Canadian hotels, attracted in part by a relatively stable economy and an increase in buying opportunities.
About 24 per cent of the $794-million that was invested in Canadian hotels during the first six months of this year was foreign money, compared to about 7 per cent of the $650-million worth of hotel deals done during the first half of 2012, according to real estate service firm CBRE.
"Historically Canadian investors bought Canadian hotels, by and large, and this is one of the first substantive breakout years," said Bill Stone, an executive vice-president at CBRE who worked on the pending sale of an interest in Toronto's King Edward Hotel to Texas-based Omni Hotels & Resorts. "We've seen a real spike, in the last eight to 12 weeks specifically, of activity."
A number of Canadian real estate investment trusts are selling hotel properties, while traditional hotel investment companies (those that specialize in owning hotels) are the largest buyer this year.
"We're experiencing a tremendous amount of hotel investment activity, and this will probably be the biggest year on record in terms of single-asset or small-porfolio transactions," Mr. Stone said. "Unlike 2006 and 2007, where there were the big M & A deals, this is a very, very active year for one-off hotels or small portfolios."
Ivanhoé Cambridge, the real estate arm of the Caisse de depôt et placement du Quebec , is in the midst of selling off its hotel portfolio bit by bit, and will be accepting first-round bids for the Fairmont Chateau Laurier in Ottawa next month (outside Canada, Ivanhoé Cambridge is also currently selling the Fairmont Washington and a portfolio of 18 Intercontinental-related hotels in Europe).
Ivanhoé Cambridge once owned as many as 60 hotels, but decided a couple of years ago that it would rather stick to office, retail and residential real estate investments.
Sylvain Fortier, executive vice-president of the residential and hotel businesses at Ivanhoé Cambridge, says he thinks the growing foreign interest stems from Canada's new-found reputation as a relative safe-haven in the wake of the financial crisis, because success in the hotel business is highly tied to the local economy.
He adds that the trend towards deals for one or two hotels, rather than entire portfolios, is the result of continuing weakness in the commercial mortgage-backed security market. "It's harder to syndicate massive loans now, lenders will keep most of their loans on their own balance sheets, so it makes it difficult to go and sell large portfolios," he says.
That being said, conditions are conducive to the pickup that is occurring in overall activity, driven by smaller deals. "Lenders are back in the market, buyers can get higher loan-to-value ratios, rates are extremely low, spreads are becoming smaller," he says.
The hotel business is not an easy one. "It's a very operational business, it takes a lot of expertise, you need to deal with business and leisure, you need to deal with seasonality, with brands," Mr. Fortier says, explaining why Ivanhoé has chosen to concentrate on other real estate asset classes. But his group has a few hotels that it's not sure it can part with. It has decided to hold onto the Château Frontenac in Quebec City ("It's an asset we sell on our postcards," Mr. Fortier says), the Fairmont The Queen Elizabeth in Montreal (because a major revitalization plan is under way) and the W Montreal (because it's attached to Ivanhoé's head office).

Full text:   Manulife Financial Corp. 's massive real estate arm is expanding in Western Canada - and increasingly choosing to develop towers rather than buy them.
The insurance company, whose real estate portfolio amounted to more than $8.5-billion at the end of 2012, is set to announce next week that it will develop a 27-storey office tower in downtown Calgary, bringing its portfolio in the city to about 1.3 million square feet.
The lead tenant will be Brion Energy, a three-year-old Calgary-based joint venture between Athabasca Oil Corp. and PetroChina Company Ltd. that operates two leases in the oil sands near Fort McMurray.
"We want to make a greater allocation to Western Canada. We strongly believe in the fundamentals there and we think that the eastern markets are very crowded right now," said Ted Wilcocks, global head of asset management at Manulife Real Estate.
Manulife announced this week that it has begun construction on 980 Howe St., a 16-storey Vancouver tower that many thought would not go ahead, given the city's building boom. But Manulife managed to secure engineering and consulting firm BGC as a lead tenant.
The two new towers are part of an uptick in the amount of development Manulife is doing. In April, it paid $588-million for a 21-storey office tower in Hong Kong that is still being built and will become Manulife's local headquarters in 2016.
The projects will double, to 10 per cent, the proportion of Manulife's real estate holdings devoted to development.
"The pendulum has finally swung to where it's more accretive to really develop than it is to buy existing stock," Mr. Wilcocks said. "You buy a 25- or 30-year-old building for virtually more than you can currently build a new building."
Prices for office towers are so high now that industry players are questioning whether many markets have peaked.

How Canadians are getting richer

Abstract: The world finally felt some financial recovery last year, save for some blips in Europe and a pesky thing everyone called a "fiscal cliff." Canada's markets and GDP didn't fare too well, but Canadians households rode the global recovery, says Peter Miron, who helmed the study. "They used to describe U.S. fortunes as tied to GM," he says. "Well, ours are tied with the U.S." Canadians saw their prosperity rise by 5.8 per cent in 2012.

Full text:   Forget last decade's pesky recession: Canadians' net worth is at a record high. Our average household net worth broke $400,000 at the end of 2012, beating out our American neighbours once again, according to the sixth-annual Wealthscapes study, which uses more than 100 financial and investment statistics to paint a picture of Canadian prosperity. Josh O'Kane examines five highlights
1. We saw a wealth upswing
The world finally felt some financial recovery last year, save for some blips in Europe and a pesky thing everyone called a "fiscal cliff." Canada's markets and GDP didn't fare too well, but Canadians households rode the global recovery, says Peter Miron, who helmed the study. "They used to describe U.S. fortunes as tied to GM," he says. "Well, ours are tied with the U.S." Canadians saw their prosperity rise by 5.8 per cent in 2012. Americans saw a jump, too, cutting Canada's lead by half to less than $20,000, if the dollars are held at par. If they overtake us, Mr. Miron says "it probably means their economy is booming, so we've got other reasons to laugh."
Net worth, liquid assets, real estate assets, and debt are at an all-time high in Canada, thanks in part to low interest rates.
2. Appetite for risk? Head east
In 2011, Nova Scotians played the market before it really recovered and got burned. But they stuck to their guns, and it paid off in spades: Households in the province saw investment portfolios gain 11 per cent last year.
"I really love Nova Scotia," Mr. Miron says. "They seem to be quite happy to take risks with their money. ... The markets went up, and they did quite well because of it. That's pretty commendable."
Mark Austin, who heads research with the Nova Scotia Commission on Building Our New Economy, says he hopes that Nova Scotians put their money back into "ourselves, our local economies and in creative ventures that link Nova Scotia goods and services with world markets."
3. It's merry on the prairie
Alberta is on the cusp of passing its luck to its eastern neighbour. "Saskatchewan is definitely a booming province," Mr. Miron says.
Thanks to the province's natural resources, Saskatchewan households gained 7.6 per cent in net worth last year, the biggest increase outside Ontario. This trickled down to household prosperity through real estate gains and salary boosts. Regina was the best-performing Canadian city in 2012, with an 11.2-per-cent gain in household net worth.
Saskatchewan's strong performance makes sense in the context of its growing economy, says Robert Kavcic, senior economist with Bank of Montreal. "Net worth from housing equity is seeing strong growth there," he says, and "wage growth is stronger than in many other provinces."
4. Ontarians slashing their debts
Ontario's not actually the centre of the universe, but Wealthscapes points out at least one good reason for its residents to gloat: Ontarians paid down more debt than the rest of the country in 2012, giving them the highest rise in net worth last year.
Their average household net worth rose 8.2 per cent to $464,693. Ontarians' mortgage debt rose at about the same rate as the rest of Canada, but it's their consumer debt - credit cards and lines of credit - that had the most startling effect. Ontario is the only province to decrease its average household consumer debt, which fell 3.6 per cent in 2012. Toronto had the highest drop in consumer debt of all the major cities, at 5 per cent. "In the past six or seven years, I've not seen this in any province," Mr. Miron says.
5. Vancouver's still on top
Vancouverites can boast the highest net worth, largely thanks to their "out-of-this-world" real-estate market, Mr. Miron says. Household net worth was $662,600 last year.
Calgarians have the second-highest net worth in Canada, at $620,607 per household. But they're also burdened with the most debt of any major city: nearly $200,000 per home. (Alberta, as a whole, is taking a while to recover from the financial crisis, the study says.)
Montreal and Ottawa, meanwhile, saw "just average" increases to net worth, according to the report. Quebec City also failed to make big marks - it maintained its status as the least affluent of Canada's 10 biggest cities, helped last year by the largest rise in household debt (7.6 per cent) of any major city.

Abstract: What about your household effects and real estate? Some people like to include specific bequests in their will to detail who gets what. When it comes to personal effects, it's best to avoid including a long list of items in your will because each time you want to change the items on the list, or who gets what, you'll need to re-execute your will, which requires following formal procedures. It's a real pain.

My parents were recently revising their wills. I told them that I'd like an inheritance similar to that left by Onni Nurmi, a Finnish businessman. Mr. Nurmi wasn't particularly wealthy but left 760 shares (then worth about $16,000) of Nokia Corp. to his local village in 1962 to provide a little income to the residents of a nursing home there. By 1999 the shares had a total value of about $48-million.
What are you leaving behind in your will? Last week I spoke about choosing an executor. Today, I want to talk about some other considerations when preparing or revising your last will and testament.
Prepare your will
If you don't have a will, visit a lawyer to have one prepared. If you die without a will then the intestacy laws of your province will apply to distribute your estate in a manner that may very well differ from your wishes. If you do have a will today, keep in mind that you should be reviewing your will at least every three years, and more often if significant events take place in your life.
Cash legacies
After leaving cash to cover taxes and debts, it's common to find individuals leaving specific amounts of money to children, grandchildren, friends, relatives or charities.
You can leave an amount outright, or set up a trust fund in your will that can provide ongoing support to those individuals. If you do establish a trust, choose your trustee carefully (see last week's article at tgam.ca/cestnick-legacy); the trustee can be someone different than the executor if you choose. As for charities, be sure to name the charity and the specific dollar amount or a formula for calculating the dollar amount (as opposed to leaving that decision to your executor), otherwise you may not be entitled to a donation tax credit on your final tax return (the donation might, instead, be considered a gift by your estate, and not of you personally in your year of death).
Gifts of property
What about your household effects and real estate? Some people like to include specific bequests in their will to detail who gets what. When it comes to personal effects, it's best to avoid including a long list of items in your will because each time you want to change the items on the list, or who gets what, you'll need to re-execute your will, which requires following formal procedures. It's a real pain. If you trust your executor and family to follow your wishes it's often better to leave those personal items to your spouse or other named individuals along with a non-binding "letter of wishes" stating your desire for the distribution of specific items.
As for real estate, you can make a specific bequest of certain properties to certain individuals, including your cottage or other recreational properties. You may want to provide for any special terms upon which the property should be held (the property could, for example, be held in trust for the benefit of future generations). In the case of the cottage, you might consider leaving money in trust to help cover all or some of the maintenance costs in the future, if you have the means.
Residue of estate
After you've provided for the payment of taxes and debts, made cash legacies, and distributed your real estate and personal effects, the remainder of your estate is called the "residue." It's common for the residue to pass to your surviving spouse, if you have one. But regardless of who receives the residue, it might make sense to leave those assets in a trust for your beneficiaries (or one trust for each of them).
A trust can protect the assets from creditors or a marriage breakdown of your beneficiaries. A trust established in your will can also allow your beneficiaries to split income with the trust, resulting in tax savings today (although this benefit is currently under review and the government is proposing to change our tax law to eliminate this benefit). If your beneficiaries are minors, then placing their inheritance in trust will be necessary until they reach age of majority in your province. You can provide instruction to the trustees to distribute the assets at certain ages (one half at age 25 and the balance at age 30, for example), or you can leave distributions to the discretion of your trustees.
Whether a trust makes sense will depend on factors such as the size of your estate, age and competence of your beneficiaries, and desired tax planning.

Abstract: In 2005, when Slows Bar-B-Q opened in Corktown, Detroit's oldest neighbourhood, it started a renewal that's still going, with later additions such as Astro Coffee and the Sugar House Bar and the two-bedroom hotel Honor & Folly, upstairs from Slows. Get your food to go and have an only-in-Detroit picnic on the grass in front of Michigan Central Station, built in 1913 and abandoned when Amtrak stopped service in 1988.

Full text:   There's more to the Motor City than bankruptcy and ruins. Ten reasons to hightail it across the border
Last week's bankruptcy filing is only the latest in an assembly line of bad news that Detroit's been steadily pumping out since the 1950s, when its population started to decline from a high of just less than two million to its current 700,000. Detroiters are used to it. So if you visit, don't expect to find a lot of moping. And, really, you should visit.
Detroit is a great city clouded by headlines about financial impropriety, pension funding woes, industrial decline, racial tension and, more recently, its stupendous ruins. Yes, decay and poverty are plentiful here, but cities are the products of their weaknesses as well as their strengths, and the result in Detroit is a rare glimpse of what American pride looks like when it's uncoupled from the overweening self-confidence that can make it so unpleasant. The result is an upbeat small town with skyscrapers - and a counter-intuitively friendly one at that.
"In some cities, you go to a bar and talk to the people you came with and the people you want to go home with and that is it," says Jeanette Pierce, a third-generation Detroiter and long-time city booster who leads free walking tours (dhivedetroit.org). "In Detroit, we talk to everyone, including the owner, because he's bartending."
I visited for a weekend recently but could have spent a week. Below are my 10 favourite Detroit sights and experiences. It'd be a fine time to spend some of your tourist cash there. I hear they could use it.
The Westin Book Cadillac
The history of this 31-storey neoclassical hotel mirrors the city itself. Built in 1924, it has stumbled almost from the beginning and was vacant for 20 years before it reopened in 2008. From the west-facing windows, you can see the bus station named after Detroit native Rosa Parks, and rumour has it that it was in this lobby that Lou Gehrig collapsed while climbing the stairs on May 2, 1939, prompting him to miss that day's game against the Tigers and ending his 2,130 consecutive game run. When it was announced at Briggs Stadium that day, in a thoroughly Detroit move, Tiger fans gave the Yankee a standing ovation. 1114 Washington Blvd., bookcadillacwestin.com
Detroit Institute of Arts
One of the first stories that came out after the bankruptcy announcement bruited the idea of selling off the museum's multi-billion-dollar collection, which includes work by Titian, van Gogh, Rubens, Rembrandt and the original Howdy Doody marionette. It's a magnificent collection, one of the best in the world, and its centrepiece, commissioned by the Ford family back in its glory days, is an atrium-sized, four-wall work by Diego Rivera that both celebrates and excoriates the auto industry that paid for it. It's the Mexican polemicist's masterpiece, and in itself, worth the trip. 5200 Woodward Ave., dia.org
Motown Museum
Detroit is full of examples of the unexpected benefits of failed capital - the best is this place. If located in Chicago or London, 2648 West Grand Blvd. would now be an enormous glass interpretive centre designed by Frank Gehry with a Ken Burns IMAX show and an audio guide narrated by James Earl Jones. But this is Detroit, so the little tract house that Berry Gordy named Hitsville, U.S.A., and turned into the heart and soul of Motown is still just that. The gift shop's in the front room and the famous Studio A - where legends such as the Supremes, Smokey Robinson, Wilson Pickett and the Temptations recorded - is just as it was in the basement. 2648 W. Grand Blvd., motownmuseum.org
Rowland Café
Vienna's got some impressive cafes, but frankly none of them compare to the Rowland, which gets to occupy nearly the entire promenade level of the Guardian Building, one of the world's best art deco towers, completed in 1929. It's the sort of space that couldn't exist anywhere that real estate had value. 500 Griswold St., therowlandcafe.com
Comerica Park
Detroit loves its Tigers and the feeling is infectious. I went early in the season, a statistically insignificant game against the Red Sox, and the place was packed. It looked like the whole city had turned out to cheer. I find baseball to be a boring spectator sport, but this place was electric. 2100 Woodward Ave., detroit.tigers.mlb.com
The Heidelberg Project
In 1986, Tyree Guyton painted some polka dots on the side of his house at 3651 Heidelberg St. Now, that property is the centre of the world's largest outsider art project, a city block of discarded shoes in discarded ovens, waterlogged stuffed animals piled onto a small boat in a vacant lot and dozens of other things a good deal less describable. Heidelberg Street and Mt. Elliott Street, heidelberg.org
Earthworks Urban Farms
As the population shrank and houses collapsed, a good deal of once arable land started to reveal itself. Groups such as Earthworks (run by Capuchin monks) realized they could both grow food for the often underemployed residents who stayed, and maybe teach them a few skills. The result is tons of produce and a new generation of urban farmers. Call ahead and ask for Shane Bernardo. He'll give you a tour and a glimpse of the best possible use of a downsized city. 1264 Meldrum St., 313-579-2100 ext. 204, cskdetroit.org/EWG
Eastern Market
This 17-hectare market has been going since 1891, and though it runs every day, Saturday's the big one. Stop by Russell Street Deli (everyone else does), then step into this mixture of farmer's market, artisanal depot and community hub. When I was there, Lawrence Zienert was selling eggs, as he had been since Calvin Coolidge was president. And say hello to David DeVries at DeVries & Co., the cheese and dry goods store his grandfather founded in 1887. As you'll have come to expect in this city, he's happy to chat. Rivard Street and Napoleon Street, detroiteasternmarket.com
Slows
In 2005, when Slows Bar-B-Q opened in Corktown, Detroit's oldest neighbourhood, it started a renewal that's still going, with later additions such as Astro Coffee and the Sugar House Bar and the two-bedroom hotel Honor & Folly, upstairs from Slows. Get your food to go and have an only-in-Detroit picnic on the grass in front of Michigan Central Station, built in 1913 and abandoned when Amtrak stopped service in 1988. Once the world's tallest train station, it's now the city's most famous ruin. Slows: 2138 Michigan Ave., slowsbarbq.com
The Anchor Bar
This is the bar where you want your nights to end. The Anchor (not to be confused with the Buffalo institution of the same name) is Detroit at its local finest. Once a journalists' hangout, it still holds monthly Beer & Politics discussions in the back room, though it's become mostly a Red Wings joint. Get a seat at the bar and say hi to whomever sidles up next. The stories won't disappoint. 450 W. Fort St.

IF YOU GO
Where to stay
The Inn on Ferry Street Located in a historic area of midtown Detroit, this collection of four immaculate Victorian homes and a pair of carriage houses is a quiet retreat from the downtown bustle not that far away. Not that the distance is an issue: The boutique inn's complimentary shuttle service is extremely reliable, dropping guests off and retrieving them later, wherever and whenever.
Take me out to the ball game? The driver will do that, and be back at Comerica Park to pick you up soon after the last pitch is thrown. (On one of my stays, I was popped over to the Motown Museum and retrieved a few hours later for a ride to the bus station - all this, after I had already checked out.) The rooms are comfy, sunny and tastefully appointed. Buffet breakfast is a relaxing event. The staff? Uniformly of upbeat disposition, with a pleasant professional manner. The Inn is a a no-hassle deal, top to bottom. From $149 to $259. 84 East Ferry St., 313-871-6000, innonferrystreet.com.

Full text:   erenzetti@globeandmail.com
It is one of the rites of parenthood to look at your sleeping baby and wonder what path he or she will take: Will she be a mountain climber? A painter? An actuary? Then you back away - carefully, in case she starts screaming - and think: She can be anything; her world is unwritten.
There is one baby, however, whose future is already written. You may have heard about this child, whose imminent arrival caused news crews to gather in the sweltering heat outside St Mary's Hospital in London. In their first few weeks as parents to Baby Windsor, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will wonder many things - is he supposed to make those noises? When will he ever go to sleep? - but they will not wonder if they've spawned a future notary public. There is a crown in the Tower of London that will one day sit on Baby Windsor's head.
Of course, things could change. Baby Windsor could follow the path of his great-great uncle and decide he doesn't want to be king. Perhaps there won't be a crown to inherit; a republic might rise in place of the monarchy. But, all things continuing in a conservative direction, that tot is headed throne-ward.
How claustrophobic it must be to have a path laid out for you from birth. No wonder, then, that the theme of escape runs like a gilded ribbon through royal literature. Some girls want to be princesses; some princesses just want to be girls. The jaded newspaper reporter in Roman Holiday asks the runaway princess what she'd do if she could slip the prison of the palace: "Oh," says Audrey Hepburn's Princess Ann, "I'd just do whatever I liked, all day long."
Roman Holiday was released in 1953, when princesses were the height of glamour: Lovely young Elizabeth had just become Queen, and in a few years Grace Kelly would marry the prince of a fairytale kingdom (built on arrivistes' gambling money, but hey, never look too closely at fairy tales.) Roman Holiday is the most astringent of romances, peeling back the glamour of palace life to show that it's more like a small-town registry office, all bureaucracy and bylaws. Princess Ann runs away and, incognito, spends a magical day eating gelato, getting into fistfights, and falling in love, but in the end she succumbs to pressure and returns to her royal duties. Is she a good soldier, or a coward?
In Monica Ali's novel Untold Story , Lady Diana Spencer fakes her death and moves to small-town America. "She had had enough," writes Ms. Ali, "more than anyone should be expected to endure." Disguised by plastic surgery, crippled by the thought that she's damaged her sons, Diana (now named Lydia) works in a dog shelter and spends her days wondering if she's done the right thing. Ms. Ali argues that the world had placed the world's most famous woman in an untenable position: "The cognitive dissonance of spending one day talking to amputees in Sarajevo and the next being pursued by paparazzi while wearing a tiger-print bathing suit is hardly a recipe for emotional stability."
In real life, of course, Diana was always trying to slip her bonds, She visited a gay bar disguised as handsome boy with her friend Freddie Mercury, and a posh nightclub disguised as a policewoman with Sarah Ferguson. She delighted in hiding from paparazzi under baseball caps. In the end she couldn't hide, and, summoning photographers at will, didn't want to. This is the princess paradox.
Diana appears in Sue Townsend's 1992 satirical novel The Queen and I "dressed for adversity in denim and cowboy boots." In the book, Britain has become a republic and the royal family sent to live on a pestilent council estate that the locals call Hell Close ("What's that?" a neighbour asks when the Queen hangs a painting. "It's a Titian," she says.).
The neighbours are confounded: "How do you talk to someone whose head you're used to licking and putting on an envelope?" The Queen slices open her finger on a can of Spam and encounters the wonders of the NHS. Prince Philip is miserable, but Prince Charles is ecstatic, free to grow a pony tail, buy a stolen VCR and live in his tiny garden. "I've never been so happy," says Charles. "I am, at this moment, deliriously happy." Ms. Townsend cleverly suggests that, liberated from palace protocol, Charles would essentially be the same person, only less annoying.
The tension between duty and desire has an understandable power for dramatists. The Queen seems entirely comfortable with her lot in life, and if she isn't, she's not saying. It was entirely different for her father and mother, thrust from the corner of some dank Scottish castle into the spotlight of empire with Edward VIII's abdication. (There is a television movie titled, Bertie and Elizabeth: The Reluctant Royals .)
In fact, Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, the Queen Mother, turned down repeated offers of marriage from Prince Albert, who later became King George VI, in part because she couldn't imagine living in the royal cage, famously writing that she was "afraid never, never again to be free to think, speak and act as I feel I really ought to." Much of the Oscar-winning movie The King's Speech centres on George VI's rage at having to take the throne. "What is he, an indentured servant?" asks the speech therapist before meeting his new patient, the future king. "Something like that," responds the future queen.
The fact that he sucked it up and became a good king in a terrible time is part of the story that Britain tells itself. He did his duty. In a country where "mustn't grumble" is close to being a national motto, that's the only satisfying narrative.
William Shakespeare knew as much. His cynical, roustabout Prince Hal would much rather hang about the stews of Southwark with whores and thieves than practise diplomacy in Westminster. "Riot and dishonour stain the brow/Of my young Harry," laments his father, Henry IV.
Later, Hal will reveal to the audience that his caddish ways are a ploy so that his future exploits as king will seem more glorious by contrast. He never really wanted to escape the crown, as he reveals when he dismisses his surrogate father Falstaff in one of the most brutal moments in literature: "I know thee not, old man." Kings and queens are loyal to their destinies and their kin, and the dream of being a commoner is mere passing fancy. That's their story, and they're sticking to it.

Full text:   As a commission of experts tries to figure out how to revive rural Nova Scotia, a multimillionaire from Toronto has plowed $8-million of his own money into a down-on-its-luck coastal town.
Glynn Williams is a one-man development commission for Guysborough, a community of about 400 across Chedabucto Bay from Cape Breton: He has restored part of Main Street, where half of the buildings are for sale or empty, by transforming a 1929 general store into a pub. He converted a 1917 dry goods store into a café and shop. He runs a 10-room, 41/2-star inn built in 1837 as a home, and now the former convenience store, which had languished on the market for nine months, is a coffee roastery and bakery. And that's just the beginning.
No wonder locals - in jest, but with an undercurrent of hostility - have accused him of trying to buy up the town. While civic leaders look at zoning, land-use planning and megaprojects in an attempt to halt the slide, Mr. Williams is putting his money in small businesses.
"This is a totally gorgeous place," says Mr. Williams, an engineer by training who, after 20 years on Bay Street, runs his own private equity firm. He is a self-described serial entrepreneur with a high tolerance for risk - which is good, given the gamble he's taking reinventing this out-of-the-way town.
Subscribing to the Field of Dreams theory ( " if you build it, they will come") isn't working so far: He hasn't made any money. But he's in for the long haul and is seeing some modest victories. Along with his real-estate developments, his Full Steam fair trade coffee is now sold in Sobey's stores across the Maritimes and in Halifax's Pete's Frootique, a high-end grocer. He is in partnership with the province to build a whisky and rum distillery. His microbrewery produces about 60,000 litres a year of Rare Bird Craft Beer, which he hopes to get into liquor stores soon. He owns the town's nine-hole golf course.
He's created about 40 jobs and hopes for 30 more in five years. And the grand vision: To take his suite of small businesses under his Authentic Seacoast Company brand and build in other struggling coastal towns as well.
To succeed, the 57-year-old who flies his own plane from Toronto will have to learn from his mistakes.
"He's got that 'come from away' aspect," says Lloyd Hines, the Warden of Guysborough County. "Let's face it, he's a Toronto Bay Street man. ... Custom, culture and what's perceived as country civility is very important in communities, and so Glynn has had some different managers in place representing him here. There were some clashes in the community as there are inevitably when you are trying to do anything, and so that has left a bit of a taste."
However, Mr. Hines adds, "at the end of the day, the reality is we're fortunate in my opinion to have somebody like this guy who is willing to invest in the community. It is very important that he understands and respects the community and I believe that he does."
Raised in Montreal and Toronto, Mr. Williams and his wife fell in love with the picturesque seascapes on a bicycle trip about 25 years ago. When he saw an ad in The Globe and Mail for a five-bedroom farmhouse on 100 acres of oceanfront, he jumped at it.
His family has spent summers on the property since then and was anonymous until 2005 when he started to buy businesses, beginning with the old inn. A German couple had partially restored it, before giving up; Mr. Williams saw potential, not only in the inn, but in the community as a whole.
Guysborough, the county seat, was a vibrant port when the ocean was the world's highway. But as fish stocks declined along with the forestry industry, so did the town - in fact, it's been hit even harder than most.
"We are at the bottom end of all the metrics in terms of lowest income, lowest education, highest unemployment. ... Guysborough County, though it is an absolute paradise, is the victim of rural decline over an extended period of time," Mr. Hines says.
The young people haven't stayed - and only 20 students graduated from its high school in June.
And a wave of passive investors about 15 years ago, many from Germany, eventually left, unable to make a go of their businesses.
This year, the province formed a commission led by Ray Ivany, president of Acadia University, dedicated to reviving rural Nova Scotia. In Guysborough, Mr. Hines and his council have been trying to attract a mix of businesses through zoning and land-use planning, and have pinned their hopes on some mega-projects on the horizon, including a proposed $350-million container terminal and two multibillion-dollar liquefied natural gas plants.
Mr. Williams, however, sees the road to renewal through small business.
"In rural Nova Scotia, or any place that is challenged by geography, you have to think about making stuff that can transcend our geography," he says. "When a big industry goes, there goes the town. I think small business, if it's a diversified ecosystem of small and creative business that provides stability ... [is] the route to self-sustaining it and reversing the demographic changes."
He's conscious of the snickers - at a recent comedy event, there was a reference to Mr. Williams trying to buy the town. But he hopes that others will see the potential, and start rebuilding too.

Full text:   The founder of EllisDon Corp. had a visible impact on the day-to-day lives of many Canadians
REAL ESTATE REPORTER
When Geoff Smith was about 12, another boy told him something about his father that he simply couldn't believe. The friend, son of a property developer, claimed that Donald Smith, well on his way to becoming one of Canada's leading builders, had no qualms about showing up at a construction site and dismissing everyone on the spot.
His son was unconvinced. "I said, 'Well, that's just stupid. How would you ever get a job filled when you fire everybody?'" Mr. Smith recalls.
But to be certain, he went home and confronted the accused tyrant - and was shocked a second time. "Well," he was told, "sometimes you've just got to shake things up."
It was only later he learned there was method to this apparent parental madness: If a project wasn't going well, his father would clean house so he could send in a new superintendent with the power to hire back only the workers he knew could get the job done.
Because he knew how to get jobs done, and done well, EllisDon Corp. founder Don Smith had a visible impact on the day-to-day lives of many Canadians.
He died Tuesday morning, at 89, in a hospital in London, Ont., that is among the many public structures - including schools, office towers, shopping malls and the world's first stadium with a fully retractable roof - that his company has taken from blueprint to reality over the past six decades.
Not that all of his building involved bricks and mortar. Mr. Smith also will be remembered for reviving the fortunes of a political party that hadn't seen power since Canadians were fighting in Sicily, for charitable works, especially on behalf of children and the underprivileged, and for helping to ensure that London's establishment opened its private clubs to Jewish members.
It's an expansive footprint for a man whose mother, having suddenly lost her husband early in the Great Depression, moved the family from small-town Alberta to Toronto in search of work.
Mr. Smith was just 6 when his father "just kind of up and died," as his son Geoff puts it, in 1930. Two decades later - on April Fool's Day, 1951 - he and older brother David Ellis Smith joined forces (and their names) to launch EllisDon.
What began as a little construction shop that worked on additions to homes in London (where he had been relocated by a previous employer) now has revenues of more than $3-billion a year.
A pivotal moment came in the mid-1980s. "The company was still nowhere near the size it is today, and Don bet the whole company, at 61 years old, put everything on the line, so that they could do the SkyDome," says Geoff Smith, now EllisDon's chief executive officer.
Since renamed the Rogers Centre, the 54,000-seat taxpayer-supported stadium was costly and controversial but represented Mr. Smith at the height of his career. True to form, he ruffled feathers by boldly parachuting in a new chief manager when he became worried the project wouldn't be finished for the Blue Jays' 1989 home opener. But construction strikes derailed the bid to make up for lost time, and the Dome opened two months behind schedule.
Also a force in politics, Mr. Smith was president of the provincial Liberal party when fellow Londoner David Peterson became premier in 1985, ending 42 years of Tory rule in Ontario.
As well, he acted as chief fundraiser for Mr. Peterson, who describes him as "a legend" and "an absolutely unique cat. He built this great business, but also did it in such a unique way."
According to Paul Godfrey, the former chairman of Metro Toronto and a driving force behind the SkyDome, "when EllisDon took on a contract to do something, they did it with such excellence that they became the standard in the industry."
From Prairies to Yonge and Eg
Mr. Smith was born in Provost, southeast of Edmonton, near the Saskatchewan border, on March 23, 1924. After the death of his father, who managed a bank, the family headed east in search of better prospects. His mother found work as a clerk at Eaton's then-flagship store on College Street, and Mr. Smith grew up in the north end, near Yonge Street and Eglinton Avenue, along with his brother, sister and a young cousin.
He wanted to become an aeronautical engineer, but a persistent tremor in his hand proved a stumbling block to his studies at the University of Toronto, so he left school and went into construction. He and future wife Joan met through mutual friends, and married in January, 1949, moving to London soon thereafter. That November the first of their seven children arrived.
After its humble launch two years later, EllisDon quickly picked up a contract to work on a public school and began to grow, although the brothers eventually parted company, with David Ellis Smith relocating to Calgary.
As well as being a hard worker, Donald Smith could be a hard-driving boss. He peppered his instructions with profanity, but also knew the names of his employees' wives and children.
"He loved putting on his boots and getting out in the field," says Rick Maggiacomo, who started with EllisDon in 1972. "He would talk to an operator and say, 'What do you think of that guy? How do you think the job's going?' He would always try to find out information about the teams and how they were running jobs."
When he decided someone wasn't up to snuff, Mr. Maggiacomo adds, he'd simply gesture with his thumb, and say: "You're out."
Those supervising the work received no special treatment, especially if they appeared to be spending too much time relaxing.
When work was hectic, "I'd be happy to have some time in the trailer," Mr. Maggiacomo explains, "and then this call comes in and it's Don Smith, and I'd say, 'Hi, Don,' and he would say, 'What are you doing answering the phone?'"
Such a crack could mean one of two things: "If you were performing, those were words of endearment. If you weren't, you knew he was coming to fire you."
But the man on the receiving end says he is still with EllisDon in large measure because he was inspired from the outset by someone who, although demanding, clearly took an interest in his welfare.
"I was just trying to pump him with all this good stuff we're doing on the site, and he was talking about my personal life," Mr. Maggiacomo says. "From that day on, I felt like part of a family, not a company, and I've never looked back."
"Don could inspire loyalty in people and they would do anything for him," his son remarks. He was known for making sure to be home for dinner with his own family, even if he had to go back to work afterward. (Of his children, only his oldest daughter has not spent at least some time employed by EllisDon.)
And he was known not to tolerate injustice - a trait recognized in a lifetime achievement award from the Canadian Council of Christians and Jews for a stand he took in the late 1960s, relentlessly pressing the establishment London Club to admit its first Jewish member.
As he explained to his son, the local newspaper had decided to call each private club in London and ask for the size of a Jewish membership it knew wouldn't exist.
"My dad said, 'We're going to do something about that,' " Geoff recalls.
Mr. Smith was president of the London Club at the time, and persuaded a young Jewish lawyer, Paul Siskind, to put his name up for membership.
When several business leaders resisted, "Don said, 'Well, I'll tell you what, gentlemen: I'm going to call a meeting tomorrow and, if we don't do it, I'm going to call a meeting the next day and, if I don't get this done, I'm going to the media and I'm going to talk very candidly about what's going on here.' "
The threat worked, Geoff Smith says, and "after that, the barriers in the other clubs in London fell down very quickly."
Mr. Smith applied a similar single-mindedness to politics. "He was instrumental in building the Ontario Liberal Party," Mr. Peterson says flatly.
The two first met at a cocktail party in 1972, after the future premier had returned to London after law school in Toronto. "I remember him saying to me, 'Are you Pete's boy?' And I said, 'Yeah,' and he said: 'I like your old man and you're probably all right yourself.' It was the beginning of a great friendship."
Having grown up without much money, Mr. Smith never forgot what it meant to be given a helping hand, Mr. Peterson says, an attitude that motivated his approach to politics as well as his philanthropic efforts for such organizations as the Boys and Girls Clubs of Canada. "When he took over the leadership of the Liberal party, there was nobody that believed in us. He was always happy taking on a lost cause or an underdog."
His knack for fundraising turned around the Liberals' fortunes. "He wasn't afraid to walk into anybody's office and ask for financial support, and he always did it with humour," Mr. Peterson says. "There was a direct candour to him and a boyish charm that made him hard to turn down.
"And there wasn't a pretentious bone in his body, not one. He was never a big shot, he was always the little shot."
And he wasn't the only politically active member of his household. His wife, Joan, served as a city councillor in London for almost a decade before being elected provincially. After the Liberals came to power, she was the government whip in the legislature until 1987, when Mr. Peterson made her the first woman to act as Ontario solicitor-general.
At that time, Bob Rae was a thorn in the Liberals' side. His criticism as leader of the provincial New Democrats contributed to Joan Smith's decision to resign as solicitor-general in June, 1989, amid a controversy over her decision to call the police during an investigation of an accidental drowning in Mr. Peterson's swimming pool. The following year, the NDP defeated the Liberals, making Mr. Rae premier.
Later, of course, he famously joined the Liberal fold and says that, when he decided to throw his hat in the ring to become leader of the federal party, the Smiths were among his strongest supporters - a gesture he says taught him something about forgiveness.
"When the rumour mill started spreading about me running for leader," he recalls, Mr. Smith "phoned me up and said: 'You're the guy.'"
Turbulent times
After the thrill of SkyDome, EllisDon quickly embarked on an international expansion. But the Canadian real-estate industry was hit hard in the recession of the early 1990s, and many of the company's key clients went broke.
Geoff Smith had been appointed EllisDon's president, but wasn't getting along with his father. He had ideas about how to take the business to the next level, and was frustrated that a transfer of power seemed unlikely any time soon. So, after six years in the post, he quit in the summer of 1995 and bought a small equipment manufacturer.
His father then arranged a management-led buyout with the company's new president, James Boocher, that would have seen him retain one-third of the company. But the deal fell through on the last day of August, 1996, when Mr. Boocher couldn't come up with the money.
Mr. Smith flew back from the Caribbean, where he was negotiating a construction deal for EllisDon, and met on Labour Day with all seven children at the family cottage to discuss what to do next.
His children wound up buying the firm, while he retired with no further stake in it, although he remained on the board for some time.
Mr. Smith spent his later years going on adventurous vacations with his wife, playing the stock market, and working on his philanthropic ventures.
"He didn't travel anywhere, he would tell you, before he was 50, but after he was 50, he decided to see the world," his son says. "Even in his late 80s, they would take a six-week cruise down the Amazon."
As his journey came to an end in the hospital that he had built, his wife and children all had a chance to say goodbye to the "unique cat," whose legacy also includes 21 grandchildren and four great grandchildren.
A celebration of his life is planned for the London Hunt Club on Tuesday, starting at 3 p.m.

After more than a decade of marketing a master-planned community in the town of East Gwillimbury, Averton Homes is still luring buyers seeking affordable, modern homes in a rural setting within a 30-minute drive of major urban centres.
Detached homes at Victoria Highlands in Mount Albert will start from the mid-$400,000s.
"The beauty of the site is that it's surrounded by greenbelt and moraine, so there's not a lot of new developments that are going to be brought into the area," says Peter D'Ambrosio, president of Averton Homes, which unites Ontario's Beaverbook Homes and Alberta's Westbrook Homes.
"So it's got a country feel, but you're very close to all the amenities and conveniently located to the highway and access to GO stations so you can connect with the city."
This new release of 280 homes will be located at Ninth Line and King Street East, just east of the north end of Highway 404, allowing residents to commute to Newmarket and Markham within 10 and 20 minutes respectively.
However, visitors will find the small town supports many local attractions, such as shops, schools, a library, community centre and parks like Millennium Garden, as well as annual events, such as the Santa Claus Parade, and Sports Day and Spring Fair.
"It's been extremely popular with young families and people that have been in the area looking to retire there," Mr. D'Ambrosio added.
About 470 purchasers now occupy homes in three previous phases of Averton's low-rise community, which will grow to house 820 residences surrounded by tree-lined streets and spacious backyards.
"The lots are traditional lots, not what you see on the market today with depths of under 100 feet," Mr. D'Ambrosio states. "We actually have traditional lots that go anywhere from 33 feet in width up to 65 feet in width, and depths go anywhere from 105 [-foot] depths to almost 300 in depth."
A sense of grandeur will also be created within models of this phase with a wide range of bungalows and two-storey residences with double and triple garages.
"They're stone and brick elevations, which is a bit more upscale than previous phases, and we've incorporated similar designs, but tweaked them to be more modern," Mr. D'Ambrosio said. "There are a lot of open-concept designs with flow between rooms, which is certainly very appealing to purchasers."
For instance, plans will offer contemporary, eat-in kitchens and open family rooms, including some with double-height ceilings, as well as dens, living and dining rooms in some cases.
Carrying out daily chores and routines will be easier with ensuite bathrooms and laundry facilities on the main or upper levels.
As a bonus to buyers, each home will be built to Energy Star standards with high-efficiency furnaces, water-conserving fixtures and environmentally friendly materials.
Purchasers at Victoria Highlands can move in next spring, 2014.

Full text:   $4.9-billion spent on office towers, industrial complexes and shopping centres in quarter is $1-billion more than previous high
REAL ESTATE REPORTER
Real-estate players spent a record $4.9-billion buying and investing in commercial property in the Greater Toronto Area in the latest quarter, but some are questioning whether this is the peak.
The total investment in office towers, industrial complexes and shopping centres from April to June was $1-billion higher than the previous high-water mark of $3.9-billion, which occurred in the fourth quarter of 2006, according to data from real-estate research firm RealNet Canada Inc. The latest quarterly level was a whopping 74 per cent higher than a year ago and 75 per cent higher than the prior quarter.
Major deals were done for each of the significant property types. The office and industrial sectors hit record levels of investment, at $1.4-billion and $1-billion respectively, while the retail sector recorded its second-highest level of investment, $1.2-billion, according to RealNet.
A few sizable deals drove the numbers. GE Capital Real Estate sold a large portfolio of Toronto office and industrial buildings to Slate Properties Inc., and H & R Real Estate Investment Trust and KingSett Capital divided up Primaris Retail Real Estate Investment Trust's portfolio of Canadian shopping centres, including notable Toronto-area properties such as Dufferin Mall.
Big money has been flowing into real estate for some time now, as institutional investors and industry specialists hunt for reliable investments that provide yield. But RealNet president George Carras notes that the big deals that closed in this latest quarter were first conceived last year.
"The question is, with Government of Canada bond rates going up in the last 45 days, what does that do to yield-driven markets like real estate?" he said in an interview.
Canadian bond rates generally follow the trajectory of their U.S. counterparts. Yields on U.S. government bonds began rising in early May after stellar employment data surprised the market, and then shot up again last month after U.S. Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke suggested that the central bank might start tapering back a program that has seen it buy $85-billion (U.S.) of bonds and securities each month to keep their yields low.
Higher rates will pose new challenges for real-estate investment trusts (REITs), which have benefited from a benign interest-rate environment over much of the past two decades and have been major acquirers of and investors in commercial properties. The changing environment means that investors will have more options to find yield, while REITs will probably have higher mortgage costs down the line.
"I think Toronto has had an amazing ride in the last few years from a real-estate perspective. It's been really exciting," said Gunnar Branson, chief executive officer of the Chicago-based National Association of Real Estate Investment Managers, who is in town to speak with local players. "The question is, is it too much excitement? It's difficult to say, but there is certainly heightened sensitivity."

LAND SALES DOWN
The volume of land that was bought for future residential development in the Greater Toronto Area fell sharply again in the second quarter, as builders react to declining home sales, according to new data from RealNet Canada Inc.
The dollar volume of residential land that traded hands during the latest quarter was $459-million, down 35 per cent from a year earlier. Condominium developers are buying less land for future development as the number of unsold newly constructed condos grows while sales drop. Meanwhile, builders of detached homes face a scarcity of land available for new projects.
The second-quarter numbers compare with $415-million worth of investments in residential development land during the first quarter, down 40 per cent from a year earlier. RealNet is now calling last year's figures "peak levels."

Honest Ed's is going, going . . . into the bargain bin of history

Abstract: "It's an interesting site and it's an interesting time," said George Carras, president of RealNet Canada real-estate analysts. He described the property's location as "tremendous," given its subway access on a prized retail street that has been developing from the denser city centre to the east, toward the less intensive Honest Ed's location.

Full text:   Even bargains can grow outdated.
Honest Ed's is one of the few discount stores that could ever deserve to be called iconic. With its excitable hand-painted signs (Don't Just Stand There! Buy Something!), utter devotion to retail miscellany, and tongue-in-cheek mocking of now-dead founder Ed Mirvish (Honest Ed's a Nut! But Look at the "Cashew" Save!), the Toronto landmark has supplied the city with readymade retail quirkiness while extending the incomes of budget-conscious shoppers for 65 years.
But the garish and strangely exhilarating complex at the corner of Bloor and Bathurst Streets, an intersection that could be considered prime real estate if a jokey bargain centre weren't hogging so much space, may be too valuable to be left as a place to get stuff cheap.
The massive but defiantly independent retailer is now up for sale itself - and no one is likely to get the kind of deal that the theatrical flashing lights of Honest Ed's have promised to its customer base of newly arrived immigrants, penny-pinching students, people on social assistance and shoppers who simply love the thrill of the bargain hunt.
"It's an interesting site and it's an interesting time," said George Carras, president of RealNet Canada real-estate analysts. He described the property's location as "tremendous," given its subway access on a prized retail street that has been developing from the denser city centre to the east, toward the less intensive Honest Ed's location.
The City of Toronto aims to expand density at its subway nodes, and local Councillor Mike Layton - who grew up around the corner from Honest Ed's - sounded excited by the possibility of a creative redevelopment of the site that could include a mix of retail and residential space.
"It's a large site, a lot of really cool things could happen on this site," he said. "I think there's a lot of potential for it."
But any transformation of the property likely will bring sweeping changes to a store that Mr. Layton agrees is "iconic."
In a retail environment where even the cut-rate end conducts itself with dependable chain-store uniformity, Honest Ed's can't help but stand out. This is no job-lot empire, but a single store, infused with the boisterous character and personality from another time - an era of peddlers' push carts and street hawkers, where sales volume was generated by strident self-assertion and a mesmerizing panoply of products, both needed and unneeded.
Cheapness is the one universal of Honest Ed's product line, and everything is sold in cramped rooms that scream out "bargain" by making no concessions to consumer comfort or artful display. For some unknown reason, black-and-white photos of long-gone theatrical figures decorate the store, though it seems unlikely that Dame Edith Evans or Sir Cecil Hardwicke ever queued up for bin-end votive candles or the free frozen turkeys once handed out by Ed himself during the Christmas season.
On the day that the site was revealed to be for sale, you could buy sandals for $1.99, a rolling suitcase for $19.99, a foldable Canada Day maple-leaf chair for $9.99, a decorative wooden lighthouse for $3.99 and "Ladies or Misses Fashion Summer Dresses" for a mere $2.99.
Every day of the week features its own 99-cent "door-opening special" - two kilos of yellow split peas on Sunday morning, a litre of sunflower oil on Wednesday, a kilo of oatmeal on Saturday.
Weekly specials are also used to lure in customers, who, according to 65 years of Honest Ed's theory, will then be further tempted to fill up the rest of their in-house blue shopping bags with stuff they hadn't intended to buy. This week, 99 cents will get you such necessities as 128 metres of dental floss, a shower curtain, a canister of Pringles sour-cream chips, a jar of Italian strained tomatoes, a kid's T-shirt, a litre of 2-per-cent milk, two tins of chicken Vienna sausages or 50 hardwood clothespins.
If you wonder who still uses wooden clothespins, you're clearly not an Honest Ed's shopper.
It may be a fine line between must-have bargain and dust-gathering tchotchke, and the utilitarian Ed's customer who spots a bargain in a cast-iron cooking pot may wonder who passes through the turnstile entrance off Bloor Street ("Come This Way, You Lucky People!") to buy a figurine of Jesus on the cross or a bright bouquet of plastic flowers. But the genius of Honest Ed's was not to make retail a matter of taste or discernment - just throw it all out there and let the canny customers decide for themselves.
As the congratulatory signs state, not far from the giant photos of Honest Ed posing with the Queen Mother, "Through These Doors Pass the Nicest People in the World - Our Customers." It was always the pleasant feeling at Honest Ed's that shoppers were somehow doing him a favour by taking this cheap stuff off his hands.

Leery of bond returns? You have options

Abstract: "You should slowly transition," Mr. Milevsky advises. "You see how comfortable you are with the income you're receiving. You get used to the idea of that income coming from one of these products. Then by the end of the five years you have completely annuitized the portion of your nest egg that you want to have in annuities."

Full text:   It's no secret that today's low but rising interest rates are bad for bonds. You're not getting much yield to begin with. To make matters worse, bond prices move in the opposite direction to interest rates, so the value of your bond holdings have been hit hard as rates have started to rise.
But what are the alternatives? Many investors have moved some of their bond holdings to stocks, but you can't move too much and still maintain a balanced, diversified portfolio. After all, you shouldn't be overexposed to uncertain stock markets either.
So it might help to consider other categories of investments that can provide relatively steady income and low volatility - similar to the traditional role of bonds - but with less vulnerability to rising interest rates.
Two additional investment categories that can help fill this role in the right circumstances are income properties and annuities. Of course, each comes with its own risks as well as rewards and isn't for everyone.
Income properties
There's no doubt that buying a rental property can provide steady income, but can you still earn a decent return considering today's high real estate prices?
You can if you go for a relatively overlooked market niche, says Don Campbell, author of Real Estate Investing in Canada.
Mr. Campbell's advice is to avoid high-priced condos in places such as downtown Toronto and Vancouver and instead buy three- to six-unit multiplexes in smaller centres or on the outskirts of large centres with steady population growth. He likes "under-the0radar" neighbourhoods in places such as Surrey, B.C., Leduc, Alta., Winnipeg, Hamilton or Halifax.
To be conservative, base your investment decision on the money you make on rents minus all operating and financing expenses and don't count on capital gains, advises Mr. Campbell, who is co-founder of the Real Estate Investment Network, an educational and research company.
He says if you look carefully you can find properties that earn a 10- or 11-per-cent "cash-on-cash" return, a common real estate financial metric, without too much risk. Cash-on-cash return measures gross rents minus all operating and mortgage costs (principal as well as interest), then expresses that as a percentage of the cash down payment. Mr. Campbell assumes a 25-per-cent cash down payment in his calculations.
To reduce risks from rising interest rates, lock in rates for at least five years and ideally 10 years, then strive to quickly pay down the mortgage, he says. One conservative strategy is to aim to pay off the mortgage by retirement.
Investing in a rental property can potentially give you better yields than bonds, plus the possibility of raising rents to keep pace with inflation. But you have to do your homework and get involved closely in overseeing your property, even if you hire a property manager to do much of the day-to-day work. "It is a small business and you have to manage it," says Mr. Campbell. If you want a passive real estate investment, stick with REITs and publicly listed real estate companies, he advises.
Another issue for real estate investors to consider is diversification. If your rental property is located in the city where you work and own a home, a lot of your income and wealth depends on the health of the local economy. That can leave you exposed to a regional downturn.
Annuities
Annuities are specialized products for seniors that ensure you never outlive your money. You give a lump sum of money to an insurance company; in return, you get guaranteed monthly income for life.
Unfortunately, like bonds, annuity payouts on new purchases are affected by low interest rates and are near historical lows. However, unlike bonds, payout rates also increase with the age of the purchaser, so you can get a better rate if you wait a few years after you turn 65 before you buy annuities. You may also benefit if interest rates happen to rise while you wait.
These days the "sweet spot" for buying annuities is some time in your early 70s, say many experts. Jim Otar, a financial planner and retirement researcher at retirementoptimizer.com, says it's a good strategy to start buying annuities around the time you turn 70 and then add to your investment gradually over about three years. Moshe Milevsky, professor of finance and mathematics at York University, suggests starting at a similar age and doing it over three to five years.
While waiting means you get fewer payments over your remaining life, the experts say delaying your purchases tends to provide a more efficient way to cover off the "longevity risk" of outliving your wealth.
"You should slowly transition," Mr. Milevsky advises. "You see how comfortable you are with the income you're receiving. You get used to the idea of that income coming from one of these products. Then by the end of the five years you have completely annuitized the portion of your nest egg that you want to have in annuities."
Mr. Otar says a good strategy is to invest enough in annuities so that their payouts in combination with government pension income can at least cover non-discretionary basic expenses. "It provides peace of mind because you know the basics are covered no matter what happens in the markets," he says.
Annuities are best-suited to relatively healthy seniors who are concerned about the risk of outliving their money. They tend to make less sense for seniors who place a high priority on leaving a bequest, or who are in poor health, or who already have their income needs covered by employer and government pensions.
Realize, too, that conventional fixed annuities are vulnerable to inflation that will reduce the "real" purchasing power of fixed payouts over time.

Full text:   Eliot Spitzer is back with a bid for comptroller, a job that oversees the city's finances
For Eliot Spitzer, the road to political redemption began under a searing noonday sun in downtown Manhattan with a jeer from a heckler about frequenting prostitutes.
"Very funny," muttered Mr. Spitzer. Then he proceeded to take questions from throngs of reporters for nearly an hour, explaining why he thinks he deserves a second chance.
Mr. Spitzer's tenure as governor of New York imploded in stunning fashion five years ago when it emerged that the crusading politician had paid pricey prostitutes for sex.
Now the one-time Sheriff of Wall Street, best known for his crackdown on the banking industry, is back - this time with a bid for the post of comptroller of New York, a job that oversees the city's finances.
"I want the voters to listen to what I've done, look at the record that I developed as attorney-general, as an assistant district attorney, as governor, and say: 'This guy understood the public interest,'" Mr. Spitzer said at his first event since announcing his return to politics.
"People have forgiveness in their hearts," he added, as the heckler continued shouting.
The campaign makes Mr. Spitzer the second disgraced politician to seek forgiveness from New York's voters this autumn - the other being Anthony Weiner, the former congressman who is attempting to shake off a sexting scandal as he runs for mayor.
Mr. Weiner entered the mayoral race in May and has proven adept at transforming himself into a serious candidate.
One poll conducted last month found that Mr. Weiner had emerged as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination, leaping ahead of the long-time favourite, Christine Quinn, the City Council speaker.
Mr. Spitzer and Mr. Weiner can take heart from the recent example of Mark Sanford, the former governor of South Carolina who in May managed to win a seat in the U.S. Congress despite the scandal surrounding a previous adulterous affair.
The confluence of Mr. Spitzer and Mr. Weiner's campaigns is a dream come true for New York's tabloids.
On Monday, they greeted Mr. Spitzer's return to politics with glee: "Here We Ho Again," read a headline in The New York Post.
A successful comeback for both politicians remains unlikely, but experts note the potential for a surprising outcome. "You have to assume there is a significant portion of the population that will grant redemption to these two guys," said Hank Sheinkopf, a long-time political consultant. "This is the best political theatre New York has had in years."
Mr. Spitzer, 54, made his career as a scourge of Wall Street. As state attorney-general, he launched high-profile probes into investment banks and insurance giants. He swept into the governor's office, promising to use his combative style to clean up the notoriously corrupt state capital - and was even considered a future presidential candidate.
He lasted 14 months as governor before the prostitution scandal exploded. When he announced his resignation, his wife, Silda, stood stoically at his side, an appearance that helped inspire the popular television drama The Good Wife . Mr. Spitzer said on Monday that his wife and his three daughters - now ranging in age from 19 to 23 - were supportive of his campaign.
In recent years, he has hosted television programs, taught at a local university and helped out at the family business (his father is a wealthy real estate developer). But the political bug never left him. "Do you miss it? Of course," he said in an interview with The Globe back in 2010.
On Monday, he portrayed the comptroller's office as perch from which he could shake up corporate America, particularly since it oversees investment decisions for the city's large public pension funds.
Mr. Spitzer's first public appearance gave a hint of the circus-like atmosphere that will accompany his campaign. A crush of reporters thronged him as he made his way through a city park, ostensibly to collect signatures in order to get his name on the ballot.
The few hecklers were outnumbered by vocal expressions of support: Several people darted into the media throng to shake Mr. Spitzer's hand, wish him well or seek an autograph.
"Good luck, Eliot!" shouted Barbara Dyer, 54, as Mr. Spitzer passed by a farmers' market with stalls offering local produce and handmade cheese.
"I think he was a good governor," Ms. Dyer elaborated as she shopped for vegetables. "He did an embarrassingly stupid thing. I forgive him."

Full text:   As home prices climb ever higher, a generation is lowering its living expectations. Brent Jang reports from Vancouver
At a coffee shop on Vancouver's East side, three friends who grew up on the city's West side talk about the $1-million homes that are too expensive for them to buy, that seem out of their reach forever.
Adam Kebede, Maya McDonald and Julien Thomas were all born in the 1980s, when single-family detached homes across Vancouver were much cheaper than they are today. For this first wave of Generation Y, or Millennials - people born between the early 1980s and early 2000s - finding a place to live requires a reality check and abandoning dreams of owning a single-family detached home.
"Buying a Vancouver house is not even close to affordable for us," said Mr. Kebede, 28, a graduate student who rents a two-bedroom suite with his brother for a total of $1,300 a month. Mr. Kebede, Ms. McDonald and Mr. Thomas are each renting modest places on the East side, where accommodation is more affordable than on the West side.
The three friends want to stay in Vancouver, but don't want to buy condos. All three have university degrees, and while they might one day land jobs with decent salaries, they have already shifted their attention to some form of communal living or other shared accommodation while they wait for a chance to buy into Vancouver's real estate market.
Their situation highlights an important shift in attitude that is being felt in Vancouver and to a lesser degree in other parts of Canada. Young, well-educated wage earners, who for decades have regarded a detached home as a natural aspiration, are now revising their expectations, ratcheting down their hopes.
It's a change that has major implications for home builders and local governments, who are under increasing pressure to create affordable accommodation for those priced out of the market by the rapid rise in house prices over the past decade.
The geographic line that Vancouver real estate buffs draw to symbolize the million-dollar divide in housing prices has been shifting ever eastward over the years. Houses formerly deemed affordable on the east side are now part of a landscape where only those with hefty down payments need bother bidding.
Fifty-four per cent of single-family detached properties in the City of Vancouver were assessed at $1-million or greater on July 1, 2012.
That is a dramatic increase from four years earlier, when only 34 per cent of detached houses had assessments of $1-million or higher.
Vancouver architect Bing Thom said prospective home buyers within Vancouver's city limits have to deal with the reality that single-family detached houses are not an entitlement. "It is already an outmoded lifestyle - Dick and Jane, and the kids and the dog. That's gone," Mr. Thom said. "Tomorrow might not be better than yesterday."
But Mr. Thom asserts that bigger houses aren't necessarily better, and he supports recent moves by the City of Vancouver to entice builders to construct multifamily units where single-family lots used to be the norm.
Seeking to spur builders to pack extra density on valuable land, Vancouver city council in May approved new zoning rules for the Norquay neighbourhood on the East side. It's an experiment that, if all goes well, will lead to mass rezoning in other parts of Vancouver to encourage developers to construct row houses and townhouses in areas that have traditionally been dominated by single-family houses.
Under the new regulations, builders are able to assemble at least two single-family lots that are side-by-side, and then go through the process of a development permit application.
It's an initiative designed to help people like Mr. Kebede and his friends. In the pocket where they live on the east side, once known for its working-class roots, many houses are approaching the $1-million mark, and some are there already.
The eclectic Commercial Drive neighbourhood on the East side has become the trio's edgy new hangout.
They hold no illusions about saving up enough money for a down payment for a single-family detached house on the east side, let alone on the west side, where they have fond memories of growing up and graduating from high school.
Ms. McDonald, 27, is paying $500 in monthly rent for her basement room, plus utilities. She shares a house with four others in the Commercial Drive area.
Renting is fine in the short term, but she aspires to being a homeowner in the future. "I would be interested in buying into co-op housing or a townhouse or row house," said Ms. McDonald, who will be graduating with a diploma in education this fall. She already has a bachelor of science in geography and a master's degree in urban planning.
Ms. McDonald and her friends say that barring inheritances or other financial windfalls, no one that they know in their generation will be able to buy a Vancouver single-family detached house on their own.
Andrew Yan, an urban planner with Bing Thom Architects, has produced a map that shows houses assessed for at least $1-million in blue and homes less than $1-million in red. It serves as stark illustration of a housing market that has seemingly defied logic.
"The challenge is to set down roots in the city you grew up in," Mr. Yan said.

Divvying up the single-family lot

Full text:   A new type of suburban dream has emerged: Trying to make the most of precious property
Kathleen Higgins and her husband John have one extremely valuable asset that they're trying to use to help their children get a foothold in the local housing market.
It's their own single-family lot in north Delta, currently the site of a 1970s-era house where the Higgins brought up seven children.
But they'd like to redevelop the house to help those kids. Not by building a gigantic mansion with multiple suites, as some families have done. Nor by selling it and handing out down payments to their children for starter condos, while they retire to a small apartment.
Instead, they want to take their lot and create four small houses on it, which could provide homes for four separate families - including themselves and some of their children.
"I think there's a large proportion of the population that wants to downsize, but there aren't enough choices," said Ms. Higgins, whose architect husband came up with the preliminary drawings. "I have a son who's getting married and he and his fiancee live in a basement suite. If we could do this, he could own a small home."
The City of Vancouver has led the way in encouraging homeowners to densify their single-family lots, allowing secondary suites a decade ago and then laneway houses since 2009.
But the move to fit more housing into single-family zones isn't confined to the central city, as a result of many families like the Higgins looking for options.
Throughout Metro Vancouver, homeowners from the suburbs - the place that used to be the kingdom of the single-family pastoral lifestyle - are looking at how to maximize the precious real estate they have in order to house parents, children, grandchildren and mortgage-helping tenants.
The dynamic of land-rich baby boomers is one that Vancouver condo marketer Bob Rennie talks about frequently, saying this is the group that has billions of "tax-free found money" in real estate. In his world, those boomers are in the process of cashing in their single-family properties to help their children buy their first condos, while the boomer parents use the remainder of the money to buy their retirement condos.
But although that's definitely a reality for some, it's not a scenario that every house-owning boomer is excited about.
Ms. Higgins says she doesn't want to live in a strata, with the endless rules about what you can and can't do, along with the uncertainty of maintenance. And she wants to stay in the community she's lived in for decades. That's why she turned to the idea of creating her own housing project on the family's 66-by-100-foot lot.
Planners and their councils in a number of suburbs are increasingly sympathetic to those ideas. Driven by demands from current residents for different options, by the changing demographics of those arriving, and by a general belief in creating more mixed communities, they are experimenting with what are often called "alternative" forms of housing in previously homogenous zones of one-family houses.
Last year, Coquitlam introduced a new kind of zoning that will allow owners to build four small houses on a single-family lot, as well as triplexes, fourplexes and fiveplexes. (Homeowners can choose which of those rezoning options they prefer in certain designated areas of the city.)
"There has been a fair bit of interest in what we're calling our neighbourhood attached-residential areas," said Jim McIntyre, Coquitlam's planning director. Not hundreds of inquiries, but at least dozens in the first phase of the initiative. He expects more as Coquitlam, once the archetypal bedroom suburb, continues to change.
"The conventional model of the suburban house doesn't work as much any more," he said. "The mom and pop, three kids and the station wagon, that's less the norm."
Coquitlam, like many other parts of the region, has a lot of new Canadians who are often living with three generations together, trying to figure out housing that accommodates all of them. It's the same story for many old Canadians, too.
In North Vancouver, Gary Bridger took advantage of that city's relatively new bylaw allowing coach houses to build one for his mother - an ideal solution both economically and stress-wise, since he now no longer has to race to Port Moody to check on her if she hasn't answered the phone for a few hours.
About 60 to 80 per cent of the coach houses built in North Vancouver are for those kind of multigenerational situations, says Emily Adin, the city's deputy director of community development. (North Vancouver also requires that the property owners live in either the main house or the coach house.)
West Vancouver is also cautiously looking at the possibility of allowing coach houses into that high-priced suburb, after community meetings in 2007 and 2008 produced a number of people who said they wanted more choices in West Van.
"People wanted other housing options besides the big house on the big lot or the apartment in Ambleside," said West Vancouver's senior community planner, Stephen Mikicich.
West Vancouver council did approve a pilot a couple of years ago in a small project near Marine Drive that included coach houses behind duplexes, developed by Michael Geller.
Now the challenge is to come up with something that will work for the whole city of West Van, not just a single project. Mr. Geller's project produced a fair amount of opposition, including from billionaire Jimmy Pattison who lives much higher up the slope in West Vancouver.
And a recent city-sponsored panel on the topic drew many opponents, who worried about giant coach houses blocking their views, about the effect that adding coach houses to lots will have on already-high real-estate prices, and about the somewhat exclusive district losing its character.
"There is strong support for the notion of coach houses, but the devil is in the details," said Mr. Mikicich, whose department is working on a possible set of rules for building coach houses in the city.
Back in Delta, Kathleen Higgins doesn't have a formal council policy to count on. But she is hoping that the city, which asked for new ideas for the north Delta area where she lives and which has been encouraging other housing experiments, will give her a hearing.
Like people in West and North Vancouver who support coach houses, Ms. Higgins points out that, with the way zoning works now, builders can put up gigantic houses that fit current suburban zoning codes and no one gets to say anything. That's even though those massive houses can block views, change neighbourhoods and create parking problems.
She says options like what she and her husband are proposing give suburban areas some alternatives to ripping everything down and replacing it with the biggest house around.
"Do we want Delta to be filled with big houses that no one can review?" she asks. "People are really against replacing the older houses with one big house with a number of suites."
She has gone around her neighbourhood to get support for her project. Of the 25 houses she went to, 23 were in favour of the idea.
Delta has allowed some experimentation with housing in the past decade, says Marcy Sangret, the deputy director of community planning. It recently legalized basement suites. It has allowed some coach houses, particularly in the more village-like Ladner area. And it is seeing homeowners petition more frequently to subdivide their large lots into two.
The Higgins' project is a big jump forward from that, though, with its proposal to insert so many small houses on a single lot, says Ms. Sangret. "Kathleen and her husband are really looking at the next generation," she said.
The Higgins will submit their formal application later this year, and then find out whether the suburbs are ready for their kind of new suburbanite.

Full text:   Firms that can repair decaying highways and bridges are tempting investments - especially if governments step on the accelerator
The collapse in May of an interstate bridge north of Seattle provided a sharp reminder that North American infrastructure, particularly in the United States, is in urgent need of investment.
No one was killed in the incident, but two vehicles dropped into the water and traffic was disrupted for weeks - dramatic proof of the crumbling condition of much of the U.S. highway system.
With the political gridlock in the U.S., however, the conventional wisdom is that no major spending on public works is on the horizon.
Share prices of major engineering and construction firms (E & C in the industry jargon) reflect that downbeat outlook. These companies may grow by expanding their operations in emerging markets, or by catering to the energy sector, but investors seem to hold little hope that their domestic businesses will benefit from robust infrastructure construction.
And that may present an opportunity for patient investors who are willing to bet that the need to invest in bridges, highways and other public works cannot be ignored much longer. Cash-strapped governments in the U.S. could take a lead from Canada and engage more in public-private partnerships, arrangements where E & C companies partner with investment funds and local governments to create for-profit projects, like toll roads.
"I think that will be next, and will get a lot of this infrastructure built," says Trevor Johnson, an analyst for National Bank Financial, who covered infrastructure stocks before recently transitioning to the real estate sector. "Traditionally, you had just the governments spending the money and running the assets themselves. But their balance sheets are to the point where it isn't as easy to do that, and you've got a lot of [for-profit] companies with cash. They're in a better position to finance and run these things."
Todd Wenning, an analyst with Morningstar, concurs. "I think you'll see more [public-private partnerships] in Canada and the U.S. in the next 10 years, more so than any massive government spending bill. It seems like the most natural opportunity for large-scale investment in infrastructure in the U.S. and Canada."
Clearly, there is a need. The American Society of Civil Engineers, in its 2013 Report Card on America's Infrastructure, gave the United States a D+ grade on its infrastructure, and estimated $3.6-trillion (U.S.) in spending is needed by 2020.
Canada is faring better, but still has its issues. The inaugural Canadian Infrastructure Report Card released last September by a coalition including the Canadian Society for Civil Engineering, gave a "good" rating to drinking-water systems and waste water networks, but only "fair" to municipal roads.
To be sure, the potential payoff from investing in infrastructure stocks is not going to come overnight.
Andrew Wittmann, an analyst at Robert W. Baird & Co., says all the E & C companies he covers have "ample opportunities" should U.S. infrastructure spending come through, but he's not looking for it in the short term. Although President Barack Obama's 2014 budget proposals include an "infrastructure bank" that would provide federal subsidies and matching dollars for local projects, he sees "more negative headlines than positive" as the U.S. wrestles with its fiscal issues.
Investors who are willing to wait for the mood in Washington to change can choose from a list of major E & C companies that begins with giant Fluor Corp., which trades at a price-to-earnings ratio below 14, according to Standard & Poor's Capital IQ. Mr. Wenning of Morningstar says the Texas-based company, with $28-billion in annual revenue, is now getting a smaller proportion of its sales from the United States than at any time in its 100-year history.
Its industrial and infrastructure division makes up nearly half of sales, but the company has been buoyed in recent years by projects in the energy and mining industries.
"There are only a handful of companies that can service multibillion-dollar projects," Mr. Wenning says. "With a long and distinguished track record, a healthy balance sheet, and global capabilities, Fluor is one of these select firms."
The recent cutbacks in the mining industry are a headwind to the company, but there are still plenty of positives. Mr. Wenning assigns a fair value of $63 to the shares, which traded this week around $58.
In doing so, he assumes annual revenue growth of 4.5 per cent through 2017, versus the 15.7-per-cent sales growth of the last 12 months, which was aided by contracts in the energy and mining sector. But his "bull case," which builds in revenue growth of 6.5 per cent, yields a fair value of $89, he says.
Mr. Wittmann of Baird is most positive on AECOM Technology Corp. , a Los Angeles company that is trading at less than 12 times its projected earnings for the year ahead. (It is not to be confused with Toronto's smaller TSX-listed Aecon Group Inc.)
Mr. Wittmann says the company, which engineers and manages the construction of roads and bridges, as well as mass transit and wastewater systems, has profit margins below industry averages. He has an "outperform" rating on the stock. "The profits they're earning today could be higher from managing their business a little bit better."
He also likes Jacobs Engineering Group Inc. of Minnesota for its exposure to the energy industry. More than $3-billion of its nearly $11-billion in revenue in its most recent fiscal year came from projects for oil and gas exploration companies or refiners.
Morningstar's Mr. Wenning is concerned about Montreal-based SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. , which is one of the more expensive E & C companies, with a forward P/E ratio approaching 18. At $44 (Cdn.), the stock has reached his estimate of its fair value. While praising its experience in public-private partnerships, he's worried that the corruption scandals that have "plagued" the company "could adversely impact the business at least for a few years as the new management team seeks to right the ship."
"Despite the cloud that hangs over the company, it continues to win its fair share of meaningful projects, including a metro-rail line in Vancouver and a gold mine in Quebec, but weaker demand outside of Canada is a concern."
The potential for weaker demand drags on all E & C firms. If governments confound expectations with a fresh willingness to solve their infrastructure challenges, however, it could provide these shares with an unexpected lift.

Abstract: In two key neighbourhoods, index prices for single-family detached homes dropped year-over-year but perked up on a six-month basis. On Vancouver's west side, the benchmark price of $2.07-million for a detached house was down 6.1 per cent from June of 2012, but up 3.3 per cent from December's figure. On Vancouver's east side, detached homes had a June benchmark price of $845,900, down 2.2 per cent year-over-year but up 2 per cent over a six-month period.

Full text:   Greater Vancouver's housing market is showing early signs of a revival in sales, an uptick that bodes well for the bellwether market and the rest of the country.
In June, sales surged 11.9 per cent in Greater Vancouver compared with June, 2012, for single-family detached homes, condos and townhouses - the biggest percentage jump in two years. In May, residential sales volume climbed a mere 1 per cent in Greater Vancouver, following a 19-month stretch of year-over-year declines in properties sold.
The Vancouver, Victoria and Calgary markets all displayed strength in June sales.
Total June sales reported by the Calgary Real Estate Board increased 5.5 per cent year-over-year while overall sales in Greater Victoria rose 6.6 per cent.
Calgary "somehow managed to post yet another gain last month, despite the incredible disruption of the flood," BMO Nesbitt Burns Inc. chief economist Douglas Porter said in a research note Wednesday. "More telling, Vancouver popped 11.9 per cent above [admittedly soft] year-ago levels in June."
Last month, 2,642 Greater Vancouver properties changed hands on the Multiple Listing Service, compared with 2,362 sales in June of 2012.
"If these results are at all indicative, it looks like Canadian home sales remained surprisingly resilient again in June," Mr. Porter said, adding that the housing market's tentative recovery now faces another test owing to longer-term mortgage rates edging up in recent weeks.
Still, the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver noted that last month's sales of single-family detached homes, condos and townhouses were 22.2-per-cent below the 10-year average for June. Also, June's sales were down 8.3 per cent from May's 2,882 homes that were sold on the MLS.
While the Vancouver area's residential housing prices slipped 3 per cent in June, Mr. Porter thinks the worst may be over for the local market. The benchmark index price, which strips out the most expensive properties, was $601,900 in June for resale homes, a decrease of $18,700 from $620,600 a year earlier.
Index prices in June climbed 2.3 per cent from January's $588,100.
In the Fraser Valley, which includes the sprawling and less-expensive Vancouver suburb of Surrey, benchmark June prices for existing single-family detached homes, condos and townhouses slipped 0.6 per cent to $428,400. Sales volume in the Fraser Valley decreased 9.3 per cent in June to 1,327, underscoring the cautionary view from experts who say a broad-based recovery in sales will take time.
A measurement closely watched by the real estate industry, known as the sales-to-active-listings ratio, registered 15.3 per cent in Greater Vancouver last month. B.C. real estate agents consider it a balanced market when the ratio ranges from 15 to 20 per cent. It is deemed a buyer's market below 15 per cent and a seller's market above 20 per cent in the Vancouver region.
A balanced market means that key housing indicators such as prices are stable, with more buyers and sellers able to reach deals than a year earlier, said Greater Vancouver board president Sandra Wyant.
In two key neighbourhoods, index prices for single-family detached homes dropped year-over-year but perked up on a six-month basis. On Vancouver's west side, the benchmark price of $2.07-million for a detached house was down 6.1 per cent from June of 2012, but up 3.3 per cent from December's figure. On Vancouver's east side, detached homes had a June benchmark price of $845,900, down 2.2 per cent year-over-year but up 2 per cent over a six-month period.

Full text:   If party is skunked, Tim Hudak will get the blame
aradwanski@globeandmail.com
A handful of Liberal seats will be up for grabs in less than a month, and Tim Hudak's Progressive Conservatives don't expect to win a single one of them.
That, at least, is the word coming out of Ontario's Official Opposition in advance of Wednesday's announcement that five by-elections will be held on Aug. 1. And while lowering expectations is a time-honoured tradition for politicians, Mr. Hudak has particularly good reason to do so.
Of the province's three major party leaders, Mr. Hudak is the likeliest to be left without a positive spin to put on the Tories' results in the mid-term contests. And if his party is not prepared for that, it could add to unrest about his leadership heading into the next general campaign.
Such a reaction would not be entirely fair. It's the Liberals who stand to actually lose seats this summer, and they're all but conceding Dwight Duncan's old Windsor-Tecumseh seat to the third-party NDP. Yet if they're able to hold on to three or four - and the Toronto ridings of Scarborough-Guildwood and Etobicoke-Lakeshore should give them a pretty good start - Premier Kathleen Wynne will be able to argue it's proof of her party's enduring appeal even after Dalton McGuinty's ugly exit.
At least a couple of the seats up for grabs, though, are the sort Mr. Hudak would need to take in order to win majority government. And many Tories might understandably struggle to understand why their party couldn't win a riding like London West, which it held through the Mike Harris era and which is now facing the by-election because former energy minister Chris Bentley was thrown under the proverbial bus during the gas-plants scandal.
A big part of the problem for Mr. Hudak is that, anticipating a general election last spring, the Tories were quicker than the other parties to nominate candidates in each riding. Those flag-bearers would have been perfectly adequate to fill out slates during a provincewide campaign, and might make good MPPs. But by-elections typically place much more emphasis on local profile and organization, and the PC candidates have less of it than the other parties' recent recruits.
In London, which could shape up as a three-way race, the Liberals have controversially enlisted former teachers' union president Ken Coran; the NDP is fielding former school board chair Peggy Sattler; the Tories have Ali Chahbar, a young lawyer who also ran for them last time. In Etobicoke and Scarborough, the Liberals are running city Councillor Peter Milczyn and CivicAction CEO Mitzie Hunter; the Tories have police officer Steve Ryan and real-estate agent Ken Kirupa. In Ottawa South, a high-profile candidate might have helped Mr. Hudak score a major victory by claiming Mr. McGuinty's old riding, but salesman Matt Young does not fit the bill.
Those local candidates, though, won't get blamed if the Tories get skunked. That honour would more likely go to Mr. Hudak, with critics pointing to his low personal numbers holding his party back - a refrain already common among frustrated supporters of a party that has spent a decade in the political wilderness.
To the extent that leaders matter during by-elections, getting shut out would represent yet more comeuppance for Mr. Hudak's bad introduction to voters back in 2011. His hope is to properly reintroduce himself to voters during the next general campaign, but the by-elections threaten to make the road up to them even rockier for him.
The inherent unpredictability means the Tories could yet defy their own predictions this summer. Mr. Chahbar, for instance, could take the stage as the hometown hero when the Tories meet for a convention in London this September. But to reduce the risk of that gathering getting ugly, Mr. Hudak will keep any such optimism to himself.

Take in Berlin - before it's too late

Abstract: Any other day of the week, I head to Neukolln, formerly part of West Berlin and not long ago considered one of the most dangerous and derelict parts of the city. Things have changed and the neighbourhood is now Berlin's cutting edge of cool. Prices there are rising fast, though, and Neukolln's reputation as the city's hippest 'hood won't last much longer.

Full text:   Eat, drink and be merry while it's still a bargain because this European capital is now finding that being cool comes with a price
Berliners are worried. For more than two decades, they have lived in the least expensive capital city in Western Europe and one that has been at the cutting edge of alternative culture.
Berlin's "coolness" and bargain prices are not unrelated: With low prices for real estate, particularly in postcommunist East Berlin, came an influx of artists, bar owners and restaurateurs, and finally, cool kids, not only from other parts of Germany, but from around the world, who descended on the city to eat up its culture. Berlin's relative homeliness, compared with other European cities, became an advantage in an age of irony and nostalgia.
But the low prices that keep Berlin cool are rising. The European financial crisis has sent rents soaring. Last year, real estate prices jumped on average about 20 per cent in the city's central neighbourhoods. That number is expected to climb, as the eurozone debt crisis has pushed foreign investors, such as Greeks and Italians, to put their money somewhere safe - namely, Berlin real estate. With property prices climbing, the price of goods, drinks and entertainment goes up with it. This year, may be the last chance to enjoy Berlin as a hip affordable European capital.
Mitte is where every visit to the city should begin and where Berlin's tumultuous history from Prussia to Nazism to communism played out. But Berlin's real treasures lie just outside the centre, where the city's post-historical period unfolds.
I start my day in Prenzlauer Berg, the prettiest part of East Berlin and the first suburb to have gentrified. The gentrification was so swift that 80 per cent of preunification residents have been displaced since 1989 because of skyrocketing rents. My first stop is the Barn, a charmingly pretentious coffee shop that has banned not only computers and tablets, but also baby strollers. If you happen to be in Prenzlauer Berg on Sunday, the farmer's market at Kollwitzplatz has some of the best grilled mackerel to grace a picnic table. Alternatively, the Sunday brunch at the Russian restaurant Pasternak is luscious and a steal at $18 (EUR13) all-you-can-eat.
Sundays are also a perfect time to see the giant flea market at Mauerpark. A Berlin ritual, Mauerpark attracts thousands every Sunday to browse endless stalls, eat grilled sausages and listen to ear-piercing karaoke in the "bearpit." The latter gets going around 3 p.m. and is the most bizarre but often rewarding free entertainment in the city.
Any other day of the week, I head to Neukolln, formerly part of West Berlin and not long ago considered one of the most dangerous and derelict parts of the city. Things have changed and the neighbourhood is now Berlin's cutting edge of cool. Prices there are rising fast, though, and Neukolln's reputation as the city's hippest 'hood won't last much longer. A remnant of the area's heavy immigrant background is Rissani, a bustling Middle Eastern restaurant that serves towering plates of hummus, falafel, shawarma and delicious fried halloumi cheese for EUR5. Nearby, Huhnerhaus, a takeout shack for slow-roasted chickens, sells huge portions for tiny prices.
Take your plate of chicken to Gorlitzer Park just next door and picnic on a grassy knoll. Gorlitzer Park has been described as the "anti-park." Despite the graffiti and lingering young men asking you suspiciously if "you're okay?" the green space is a treat in which to relax and enjoy the sun or enjoy a drink on the terrace of Das Edelweiss.
I've recently come to love spending afternoons at the community gardens at Moritzplatz. Not only do they serve a shockingly cheap and delicious lunch - a few weeks ago I had smoky chocolate chili with vegetables for about EUR5 - but it's also a great place to pull up to a table of strangers and join in a game of cards. The Prinzessinnengarten's mission is sustainable food and urban improvement and it's striking to see such an open community space free from development in the centre of a major European capital. While sipping fresh mint lemonade on a warm and sunny day in the garden, I couldn't help but wonder when someone would decide that this prime land would make the perfect condominium tower.
To sample classic German food - apart from the ubiquitous but flavourless currywurst - Spatzle and Knodel in Friedrichshain is the closest thing you're going to get. The gastropub serves spatzle - a kind of German mac and cheese - and an excellent wiener schnitzel for just over EUR10 - a bargain compared with what you pay in Vienna or other parts of Germany.
Nightlife in Berlin is bewildering given the vast amount of choice. There is no single neighbourhood to head out to but rather a number of areas catering to any taste scattered throughout the city. The area around Schlesisches Tor offers some of the cheapest bars in abundance. A local favourite is Madame Claude, a basement bar with furniture hanging off the ceiling and an international crowd. Although it is probably the cheapest bar in the area, Madame Claude co-owner Julien Bouille told me recently that he would have to raise the prices of drinks very soon due to rising costs. Wendel bar offers minty and very alcoholic caipirinhas made by real Brazilians. If it's warm, head to Club der Visionaere, just down the street on a barge floating in the canal. The outdoor bar and dance floor open till very late and, like most Berlin bars, is not pretentious. Don't forget to line up for an excellent burger at the end of the night at Burgermeister, housed in a former public toilet.
Over drinks with a friend and native Berliner a few weeks ago, he told me he'd bought an apartment in trendy Kreuzberg. His motivation? Bargain-basement Berlin wouldn't last much longer.

Full text:   Ten reasons why former Olympian Clara Hughes can't wait to get back to the Northwest Territories
After 20 years of exhausting my legs for winter and summer Olympic sport, I decided to give my arms a try. It was after the 2010 Winter Olympic Games that I first sat in a kayak. Along with my husband, Peter Guzman, we set out on a summer of paddling the East Arm of Great Slave Lake in the Northwest Territories. From Yellowknife to Lutsel K'e and beyond, the experience was one that stayed with me. I returned in late spring for the annual carnival and realized the adventure doesn't end when the water freezes. Here's why I keep going back.
The water
Locals dip their cups into Great Slave Lake and drink au natural; many claim it to be the purest water on Earth. (Great Slave is the deepest lake in North America, at over 609 metres.) After a month of paddling the eastern part of its expanse, and with no scientific backing, I have to agree. The water not only hydrates the body; its calming presence hydrates the spirit as well.
The fishing
Rod and reel, ice fishing, net fishing - it's almost not fair to fish Great Slave Lake. Just thinking of snagging a fish for dinner seemed to lead to a fish jumping nearby, as if to say "I'm here when you want me!" Northern Pike, lake trout, grayling, to name a few, delight the palate. All you need is the stomach to clean them.
The boating
By motor, paddle or sail, the East Arm of the Great Slave Lake is idyllic. A first-time paddler like myself will be challenged, and survive with stories to tell. An experienced one will delight in the rolling depths of water, which moved violently at times with the gale-force winds and was then glassy calm at daybreak. Countless islands and rocky points allow for escapes from the lake when it gets too rough for speed boats, let alone kayaks.
The wildlife
Eagles soar, flocks of loons and countless other species of waterfowl will delight the birder. While we only saw one bear in more than a month of paddling, signs of moose, bear and small animals were abundant. We did, however, eat moose - provided by a local hunter on two occasions. Caribou don't come as far south as Lutsel K'e any more, but cougars and muskoxen have become common. During a winter visit, we spotted a lynx as it galloped across Snowdrift River away from the roar of our snowmobile.
The Dene culture
Hand games, drum dances, going out on the water, going into the bush, stories galore - the Dene cultural experience is a treat to the present-day traveller. The experience of a lifetime is waiting in this Northern community that is still connected deeply to traditional ways. Elders share with those who are patient and open. I sat around a campfire listening to a woman who grew up in a nomadic hunting family talk about what life was like more than 80 years ago, while she turned out bannock faster than any bread-making machine. It was like listening to a living legend. Better yet, offer to help in the labor-intensive process of scraping off a moose hide and you'll always be welcomed back!
The ice
It's hard to believe such a massive lake can freeze. Lutsel K'e was formerly known as Snowdrift because of the massive drifts that historically covered the lake in winter. With less wind in recent years, those drifts are mainly a memory and that means smoother ice with plenty of real estate for kite skiing, easy snowmobile travel and (for aerobic animals like me) jogging. You're sure to have a visit from a local even as you're jogging on the ice. Someone will check on you, thinking your snowmobile broke down. Pack a sense of adventure and you could try kite skiing back to Yellowknife from Lutsel K'e. It's faster than you think, depending on wind direction, of course.
The Slushfest
Lutsel K'e's spring festivities mark the end of a long winter, and include a $5,000 ice-fishing derby - followed by tasty fish chowder (though the competition is reserved for locals, the resulting soup is for everyone). There's a jigging competition, hockey tournaments, drum dance, live music and just plain community fun. Schedules are set but everything runs on its own time, often ending late because nobody wants the fun to be over.
The silence
A quality undervalued in our busy age, the winds, waves, loons, terns, eagles are all you will hear in a kayak. In a boat, turn off the motor and float. You will be delighted by what you hear: nothing. The feeling never leaves you and will calm even the most tightly wound city nerves.
Knowing how to beat the bugs
Being from Winnipeg, I thought I knew bugs. Manitoba's mosquitoes are nothing compared to the plethora of bugs in the North. We escaped attack in two ways: camping on rocky points where the constant breeze hindered their blood-sucking strategies, and getting into the tent before the setting of the sun. The latter rule we broke once, on our first night out, and never broke again.
The park: Thaidene Nene
Translated as "land of the ancestors" from the local Denesuline language, this proposed 30,000-square-kilometre national park reserve spans the abrupt transition from boreal forest to tundra around the East Arm of Great Slave Lake. Dramatic cliffs and islands, canyons in the Lockhart River and Tyrrell Falls are just some of the rugged and scenic wilderness within the proposed boundaries. But Thaidene Nene is about more than just the land. It is the Lutsel K'e Dene homeland, where ancestors laid down the foundations of the Denesuline way of life - and it continues to provide local livelihoods and strong cultural traditions. It is a sacred place that, once you have visited, never leaves you.

Full text:   As Bayside Toronto's plan rolls out, the Aqualina project brings Miami-based architect Bernardo Fort-Brescia to town
jmays@globeandmail.com
The sweeping transformation of Toronto's lakeshore industrial wastelands into parks and mixed-use communities continues to inch forward, most of the time, at a speed that's too slow for everybody, not only the mayor and his brother.
But now and then, the pace quickens, and Waterfront Toronto (the public agency overseeing the huge project) rolls out some new, small part of the big picture that makes us sit up and take notice.
Case in point: the 13-acre scheme to be known as Bayside Toronto. Located on the inner harbour east of George Brown College and Sherbourne Common park, this $1.1-billion campus will feature attractively spaced office buildings and mid-rise apartment blocks, a park, a lakeshore promenade and (probably not to the taste of people who think there are already too many cars on the waterfront) a ring-road that will encircle most of the structures between the water's edge and Queens Quay east.
The basic organization of Bayside is rational and sound, if faintly bureaucratic, and the process that produced it is probably the best we could have hoped for. Like everything else coming down the pipeline from Waterfront Toronto, the plan for Bayside has been shaped by numerous public consultations and many hours of expert input from urban designers, architects, engineers and others. The task of translating the visions into reality in this instance has been given to Hines, a mammoth international real estate company headquartered in Houston.
The first Bayside Toronto development to hit the market is an artistically interesting condominium complex called Aqualina. To make it, Hines has partnered with local (and also large) condo supplier Tridel Group. The two developers have hired U.S. architect Bernardo Fort-Brescia, a founding principal of the Miami-based (also large) firm Arquitectonica International, to do the design. (As you can tell from this list of movers and creators, the realization of Aqualina will be a blue-chip affair. I have nothing against highly successful real estate professionals, and I know Waterfront Toronto is under a lot of public pressure to do a top-flight job. But we can hope that the organization will occasionally give greener, less eminent, more risky developers and architects a go at revitalizing our urban brownfields.)
The site set aside for Aqualina was not promising, and the restrictions on what could be done with it were daunting. The building could not be high. Long and narrow, sandwiched between Sherbourne Common and the proposed southward extension of Bonnycastle Street, the site seemed to cry out for the dullest solution possible: a solid slab running straight from Queens Quay east down to the water.
Instead of yielding to the temptation to drop something boring into the gap, Mr. Fort-Brescia decided to have some fun with the problem. He broke down the mass of the building into so many oblongs and cubes, and defined each multistorey element by putting a bold frame around it. He then stacked up these segments to various heights along the edge of the park, fashioning an irregular roofline that rises and falls (then rises again, to 13 storeys this time) as the eye moves along it from north to south.
The cube on the lakefront end of this jaunty building contains the largest and most expensive apartments. The so-called "Signature Collection" suites range in area from around 1,300 square feet to just more than 1,500 square feet, with prices between $1-million to $1.3 million. There are three penthouses at the top of cube, the largest one being 2,200 square feet in size.
The smallest suite in Aqualina is a one-bedroom loft at just 572 square feet ($322,500). The most plentiful units, the developers told me, have one bedroom and a den, and will typically sell for around $500,000.
Occupation is scheduled to commence in the autumn of 2016. The initial buyers of these 363 homes - at least the ones who actually live in what they buy, instead of being absentee landlords - will need to have a homesteading, frontier spirit, since it's going to be lonesome down by the water for some time to come. The other residential buildings in Bayside are still only gleams in the Hines corporation's eye. George Brown's 3,500 health-sciences students will come and go, and may even shop in the retail outlets that Aqualina's developers hope will fill the ground floor of the structure - but, unless they live there, students won't turn Bayside into a neighbourhood.
Given time and good luck and a large measure of patience, however, the spacious dreams that have animated Waterfront Toronto for the last dozen years might just come true. That's something worth waiting for.

LISTING AGENT
Boris Kholodov, Royal LePage Real Estate Services Ltd., Johnston and Daniel Division
The Action: Three dozen house hunters took the opportunity to explore this detached family home in Forest Hill. However, with stiff competition from other nearby properties also looking for buyers, a deal was negotiated in early May for significantly under the asking price.
What They Got: The exterior brick, stone and timber details of this roughly 70-year-old Tudor were preserved by the sellers, but the interiors were expanded and renovated with classic and modern luxuries, from elaborate trims, wainscoting and heated floors in the sky-lit master ensuite to central vacuum and sprinkler systems.
* The 3,451-square-foot plan offers a living room with a limestone gas fireplace, a formal dining area and a combined kitchen and fireside family room with upscale marble finishes, butler's pantry, built-in table, island and Sub-Zero, Wolf and Miele appliances, as well as patio doors.
* Upstairs, two out of five bedrooms have walk-in closets and a private bathroom.
* The 1,612-square-foot basement could function as nanny quarters as it has rear and side entrances, a guest bedroom, fifth bathroom and a recreation room.
* A private driveway to a garage and fenced yard round out the 40-by-165-foot grounds.
The Agent's Take: "There were several other properties on the market at the same time, however this property offered a very good combination of what people were really looking [for], including the original charm in exterior and all the modern finishings and features inside," says agent Boris Kholodov.
"This house is very much a Toronto house with finishings that are attractive to most local buyers that appreciate good quality."
Like the home's size and style, the outdoor space is standard for the area. "It's a very versatile lot because it's a normal rectangle [shape] and it's flat," Mr. Kholodov notes.
"Most buyers ... like a lot that is large enough to accommodate a swimming pool if they decide to put one in."

Full text:   Bold moves - like doing away with the dining table - make for a friends-friendly room
kdeck@globeandmail.com
We recently completed a home for our photographer Barry Calhoun and his partner local real estate agent Teresa Comeau. It's a clever duplex, just off Main Street, in one of the hip Eastside communities of Vancouver. Built from the ground up, our team played a major part in the design.
A long-standing friendship with the clients put us in a unique position, allowing us to make bold moves with the floor plan, and speak candidly about our rationale.
One outstanding result of this candour was the kitchen, which we reconfigured radically from the architect's original proposal. We knew Teresa and Barry loved to cook and entertain, and the plan the architect had laid out, though efficient, was far more conventional than they are.
No dining table?
The original design featured a U-shaped kitchen tucked into the far corner of the main floor, which allowed room for a small dining table. Knowing Barry and Teresa's joy for entertaining big groups, we saw the challenges with this layout. We were concerned mainly with the kitchen's distance from the living room, which would separate the hosts from their guests at party time. The U-shape of the kitchen also limited storage space, and the potential number of appliances.
Fortunately, the area for the proposed kitchen and dining room was long and wide. So as an alternative to the U-shape, our team suggested a galley-style kitchen running along the east wall of the space, with a 12-foot island down the centre that incorporates an impressive dining zone for six.
With this innovative layout, the kitchen now opens naturally onto the living room, making it easy to cook and entertain while guests gather around the island. It also allows ample room for appliances and storage.
Why is the fridge relegated to the back corner?
My preference is to always try and conceal any dishwasher or refrigerator by using built-in models that have millwork panels - I like the refined look.
But the challenge on a budget-conscious build such as this one is that a decent-sized built-in fridge, at counter depth, starts at $6,000.
By comparison, standard depth, stainless steel options are a more reasonable $2,500 and under.
So in this case, we selected a sleek conventional model and tucked it into the far corner, still close to the cooking triangle, but far less conspicuous.
On the opposite end of the kitchen, we included a mid-range, under-counter beverage fridge. This creates a hub for serving drinks outside of the cooking area - allowing the bartender and chef room to work in culinary harmony!
Don't countertops need to have an overhang?
The average countertop overhangs three-quarter inches from the cabinet doors. This provides an allowance for any slightly out-of-plumb cabinetry, and also provides depth for knobs and pulls to be set back.
But with this island, in order to keep the traffic zones a minimum of 36 inches wide, we really had to pinch every inch we could. To do so, we eliminated the overhang and designed a three inch chunky countertop that was flush with the cabinet doors.
We also skipped standard hardware (which has a one inch projection) and instead notched out the handles from the doors. (We didn't want guests leaning against sharp pieces of hardware.)
The only place this wasn't possible was on the inside of the island, where the garbage pullout and dishwasher both required conventional pulls.
Why put cabinets out of reach?
Barry and Teresa's home has lofty 10-foot ceilings on the main floor, and we knew we had to capitalize on this height. In the kitchen, it meant designing the cabinetry to meet the ceiling.
This not only enhances the grandeur of the room, it also provides extra storage for seasonal dishware, vases and miscellaneous extras.
The challenge, of course, is accessing this space. If we'd had a little more length (and budget) we would have incorporated a rolling ladder. But instead, we suggested a six-foot, antique-style ladder, installed on hooks on the kitchen's far wall. (Barry and Teresa have yet to get it, but in the meantime, standing on the countertop works just fine ...)
Why the box on the ceiling?
With a high ceiling, it's nice to add a ceiling drop that breaks up the white plane and adds visual interest. Here we designed a simple drywall box with the same dimensions of the island, and recessed a centre section that holds the canopies for black barn-style pendant lights.

Abstract: The "adjacent buildings" that residents of 2221 Yonge will need shielding from are, as a glance at the map shows, the towers of Minto Midtown, the bulky, tall condo complex right next door.

Whatever its impact on Toronto turns out to be - more on this topic presently - the 56-storey condominium tower that's been proposed for 2221 Yonge St., just south of Eglinton Avenue, has brought fresh public attention to a family name long venerated by local skyscraper fans.
It's Pei - as in Ieoh Ming Pei - the architect of the austere, elegant high-rise and landmark known as Commerce Court West. We are hearing the surname these days because his son, Li Chung (Sandi), has been enlisted by Tower Hill Development Corp. to be lead designer of the building slated to rise at 2221 Yonge. (The Toronto-based firm of Quadrangle Architects is also involved, on the managerial end of the job.)
Now 96 and living in New York City, I.M. Pei was one of those immigrant American architects who hastened the transformation of modernism, during the Cold War years, from the intellectually elitist, usually left-leaning taste it had been in the 1920s into post-war capitalism's favourite power style. Ludwig Mies van der Rohe was another designer who did so.
Like I.M. Pei himself, who was designing as recently as 2000, modernism has outlived the most creative years (roughly 1955 to 1975) of its marriage with big business. A kind of neo-modernism is thriving in various versions nowadays, if ordinarily on a modest scale, and usually without the reforming zeal of the early days.
And, of course, big buildings that look like cereal boxes from the 1970s are still going up, though they rarely have the broad-shouldered confidence of their Cold War predecessors. Li Chung Pei, for his part, soldiers on in the corporate-modernist tradition his father did much to shape. In his Yonge Street building, however, he claims to have freshened up the old formulas a bit.
"We sought," the younger Mr. Pei said in a statement, "to distinguish this project from ubiquitous glass tower schemes by highlighting its wraparound balconies as a unique design feature, rather than as appendages to a large glassy mass. Ours is an updated version of the modernist concept that provides abundant outdoor living space, shading, and privacy from adjacent buildings."
For the record, prices start around $200,000, and suite sizes vary from just 386 square feet to 997 square feet. Amenities include a lounge on the 56th floor and a "resort-inspired" spa with three pools. The common areas, such as the lobby and the lounge, will be designed by the Toronto firm of Munge Leung.
The "adjacent buildings" that residents of 2221 Yonge will need shielding from are, as a glance at the map shows, the towers of Minto Midtown, the bulky, tall condo complex right next door. Mr. Pei's high-rise takes the form of a slab, its narrow end fronting on Yonge, its broad sides running between Yonge and Cowbell Lane. The architect's solution to the structure's tight fit with the neighbouring towers includes faceting the south wall of his building, so that the suites open toward the southwest and southeast instead of directly southward.
It's a simple gesture. It's not one that's particularly inventive or original. And, so far, it has not convinced the city's planning department that the relationship between Mr. Pei's skyscraper and Minto Midtown meets the standards set by the new official tall-building guidelines.
The objections of the planners, as it happens, have to do with set-backs and other urban-design details in Mr. Pei's scheme. My problem with it lies elsewhere, in its aesthetic shortcomings. Apart from having floorplates that are five-sided, this project differs very little from the many other homely, run-of-the-mill apartment blocks that have become common sights - and eyesores - in Toronto since the onset of the current condo boom.
The main entrance is bland, the porte-cochere, advertised as "grand," is dull. True, the building will show a little more concrete than we're used to seeing in glassy high-rises - the edges of the floorplates flip up to form balcony fronts here and there - but this move isn't enough to relieve the tedium of the tower's appearance. The best thing that can be said about the project is that, viewed as a whole, it isn't entirely awful - though the Yonge Street façade of the six-storey podium, which looks like a parking garage, is in fact pretty awful.
That's not good enough. Every condo tower in this city doesn't have to be a stunning show-stopper. But every one can and should do Toronto the favour of not being tiresome - especially one that's set to go up in an interesting, busy neighbourhood such as Yonge and Eglinton. Every tall structure should contribute something, however small, to the local conversation about the art of building and living tall. This one doesn't.

Bond prices have fallen sharply, causing head-scratching among some analysts who wonder why fixed-income investments should be losing so much value while inflation - the traditional enemy of bonds - is still muted.
In my opinion, it's all about signs of a stronger U.S. economy. This time around, rising inflation has not been the enemy of bondholders; the damage has been done by an improving outlook for the world's largest economy.
Let me explain. When you buy a traditional bond, you are guaranteed a certain interest rate as a reward for surrendering your money for the bond. This reward actually consists of three sub-rewards.
First is the reward for postponing consumption for the future: This is the real interest rate. Second is the reward for possible loss of purchasing power - an offset for expected inflation. Third is the reward for possible loss of capital - the risk premium.
When dealing with government bonds, you can ignore the risk premium since there's essentially no chance of default. So let's focus our discussion on the real interest rate and the inflation premium.
In the short run, the real interest rate is driven by the business cycle. When the economy expands, the real interest rate rises and when the economy contracts the real interest rates falls.
Inflation is also driven, at least in the short run, by the intensity of economic activity. If activity picks up, it puts pressure on labour and commodities markets, among other things, and raises prices.
Right now, inflation and expectations about future inflation are subdued by any measure. Thus current inflation is not the reason that nominal interest rates have risen and bond prices have fallen.
But real interest rates are going up. Recall that bond prices move in the opposite direction to interest rates. Over the past couple of months, real-return bonds (a special type of bond that pays a fixed return on top of inflation) have lost value, indicating a steady climb in real interest rates.
What's caused this run-up in real interest rates? Probably signs of a pick-up of economic activity in the United States.
New house sales are up, as are car sales. Consumer and small business confidence is rising. State and local governments have started to hire again. Initial jobless claims are dropping fast. The energy boom in the U.S. is also adding to confidence.
This has not yet translated into fears about inflation. Again, you can turn to the bond market for a reading - real return bonds have lost much more over the past two months than traditional bonds, which indicates that while real interest rates are rising fast (hurting real-return bonds), the impact on traditional bonds has been more muted. This suggests that any worries about inflation, which can gut bond returns, are muted.
Bottom line: The U.S. economy is on an upswing putting upward pressure on real interest rates leading to an increase in nominal interest rates, too. But the increase is not due to increased expectations about inflation. It is because of an increase and expected increases in the real interest rate.
What does this mean for the bond and stock markets? It is bad for nominal and real return bonds (especially the latter). It's good for companies and stocks that can grow profits, but not so good for high-yielding stocks and real estate, because higher payouts on bonds will lure investors away from income-producing equities.
Now, if you are a contrarian and believe that the signs of economy pick up are premature and economic activity will peter out over the summer months, then investing in real return bonds may be the best strategy, because their recent decline has built in an expectation of a sharply accelerating economy. If that doesn't come to pass, real rates will fall back and real-return bond prices will go up.

Full text:   Michael Elliott resigns for health reasons
Even the quaintest towns in Quebec aren't immune from police probes, city-hall intrigue and mayoral resignations these days.
Take the case of Hudson, population 5,000.
The leafy western suburb of Montreal, known as a community-minded enclave and the hometown of late New Democratic leader Jack Layton, is undergoing its own junior version of the scandals that have rocked big-city neighbours Montreal and Laval.
First, the town uncovered apparent administrative errors involving pay to 36 municipal employees.
After an internal audit, it concluded that funds had been misappropriated and it called in the Sûreté du Quebec. Police are looking into "alleged fraud," the town says.
Then, at this month's council meeting, it came to light that 315 business and residential taxpayers had failed to pay their taxes for years, to the tune of $1.2-million.
Unsettling matters further, on Tuesday the town's mayor, Michael Elliott, announced his resignation.
It was easy to miss the news, since Montreal mayor Michael Applebaum stepped down the same day to face 14 criminal counts of fraud, conspiracy, breach of trust and municipal corruption involving two real-estate deals in his former borough.
In the case of Mr. Elliott, he says he called it quits for personal and health reasons.
"I had open heart surgery last year, and the kind of stress the council has been under in the last three or four months has been a little over the top," Mr. Elliott told the Montreal Gazette.
The 72-year-old mayor, who is fond of calling Hudson "the best little town in Canada," said he would return to work as a carpenter.
While the turmoil may pale next to big-city Montreal, which has lost two mayors in seven months, or Laval, which is under trusteeship and its former mayor facing charges of running a criminal organization, the case of Hudson is still troubling for local residents.
To many, it seems that Hudson is the last place you'd expect a possible fraud scandal.
"Everybody's in denial. Everybody's in shock," city Councillor Diane Piacente said on Wednesday. "Here is a quiet little town and you have all these irregularities. It might be more than we bargained for," she said.
But she insisted that the town is doing its best to get the city back on track. "It's nothing that can't be corrected."
The town issued a press released late Wednesday saying it will elect an interim mayor and will press on to address its problems. "The events give a greater sense of meaning to Hudson's motto of noblesse oblige ," it said, "reminding us that with power comes responsibility."

Full text:   Limiting restaurants would be a bureaucratic nightmare fraught with danger
mgee@globeandmail.com
A decade ago, the strip of Queen Street West that runs through Parkdale was one of the seediest in the downtown. Today, it is one of the trendiest, with new coffee shops, galleries, restaurants and boutiques popping up left and right, drawing people from all over town to enjoy the bohemian buzz. Could this be a bad thing?
City hall seems to think so. This week, the Toronto and East York Community Council recommended introducing a new rule that no more than 25 per cent of existing properties in four sections of Queen from Dufferin to Roncesvalles could be occupied by restaurants and other eating-and-drinking establishments.
Since 2008, says a city report, 34 new restaurants have opened on the strip, and many are operating late into the evening as lounges or bars.
Some residents complain about (horrors) crowding on the sidewalks as people line up to get into their favourite haunts. Others don't like the congestion on the street from cabs and cars dropping off visitors to the neighbourhood. Still others say noisy revellers are disrupting their sleep.
Gord Perks, the local city councillor, says he is worried that Parkdale will become a "monoculture" of entertainment joints, crowding out the corner stores and hardware stores that local people, many of them poor, depend on in their daily lives.
"The notion of having to drive to get a light bulb is offensive to me," said Adam Vaughan, who represents a nearby ward and wants to borrow the bar-cap notion to protect Kensington Market.
He told me that the new bars and restaurants are like an "invasive species" in a garden, which must be weeded to maintain its diversity. "You can't allow unleashed market forces to transform streets."
But market forces seem to be doing wonders for Parkdale. Long-time resident Sheila Lippiatt said the community tried all sorts of things to spruce up the street, from better lighting to historic street signs. Nothing happened until new business started coming in.
"Now you want to alter the progress of Queen Street," she told the community council, speaking against the 25-per-cent cap. "It is the best that it has ever been since I've been here."
The fear that you won't be able to buy a light bulb or quart of milk in a gentrifying Parkdale seems overblown.
In the few blocks of Queen west of Dufferin, I count a falafel joint, a roti shop, a hardware store, a Dollarama, an independent pharmacy, a Vietnamese storefront doctor, a public library and at least two convenience stores, one of them selling flowers and produce.
If the fear is about rowdy partying, there are better ways to control it - more policing, stepped up enforcement of noise bylaws - than keeping out new business.
Capping restaurant development could have perverse side effects. For one: existing proprietors, protected from new competition, would get a windfall. For another: if one business moves out and a restaurant or lounge can't take its place, the storefront might stand vacant - or be occupied by some other lightbulb-free establishment like a designer-clothing place or upscale hair salon.
Even city staff admit that there will be "administrative and operational challenges" involved in monitoring how many restaurants open in four separate quadrants of Queen.
They say it might require a new "data management process" between two agencies: City Planning and Toronto Building. That sounds like shorthand for a bureaucratic nightmare.
The whole idea of legislating something as fluid as the changing retail complexion of a street is wrong. Cities evolve. Parkdale was once a prosperous commuter suburb, with grand homes on shady avenues.
It became a working-class quarter, then a magnet for struggling new immigrants. Now it is changing again, with young couples moving in and real estate values rising.
Most of the recent changes are for the better. What has emerged in Parkdale is a vibrant, very-Toronto mix - hipsters and Tibetan immigrants, parents pushing strollers and young professionals heading off to work, the working class and the middle class; all mingling on a newly vibrant, rapidly changing Queen Street West. That can't be a bad thing.

Full text:   Arrest warrants for three men arrested on Monday outline two different sets of allegations involving Michael Applebaum - that he arranged separate bribes in exchange for a political favour and approving a project
On a winter Friday in early 2011, several provincial and municipal dignitaries attended the unveiling in Montreal's west end of the $15-million, eco-friendly Notre-Dame-de-Grâce SportsCentre.
"A project like this one is proof that our boroughs are well-managed," then Montreal mayor Gerald Tremblay boasted in a speech.
Also in attendance was the local ward's top official, borough mayor Michael Applebaum, who said the ultra-modern facility near Benny Park would "build bridges between generations."
Two years later, a disgraced Mr. Tremblay had to resign last fall amid allegations that his party received secret donations from construction firms involved in bid-rigging. His successor, Mr. Applebaum, who had recast himself as an independent, is now also hit by scandal, after he was charged Monday on 14 criminal counts of fraud, corruption and bribery in connection with two real-estate projects in his borough.
One of those two projects was the NDG SportsCentre, a source says, confirming information first reported by Radio-Canada.
The other project, according to the source and Radio-Canada, was the Onyx condo project, a 10-storey structure on Troie Avenue, at the foot of the Mount Royal, near the University of Montreal.
Tens of thousands of dollars in bribes were paid as part of the allegations, according to Robert Lafrenière, the head of UPAC, Quebec's special anti-corruption squad.
UPAC officers arrested Mr. Applebaum early Monday morning, along with former city councillor Saulie Zajdel and Jean-Yves Bisson, a former director of permits in Mr. Applebaum's borough of Côte-des-Neiges-Notre-Dame-de-Grâce.
Mr. Applebaum is facing 14 criminal counts, including fraud, corruption, breach of trust and conspiracy for the period between 2006 and 2011.
Mr. Zajdel is charged with five counts of breach of trust, fraud, corruption and secret commissions for the period between January, 2007 and December, 2008.
Mr. Bisson is charged with four similar criminal counts, between 2006 and 2008, including receiving bribes in exchange for helping with the issuance of a demolition permit. Construction of the Onyx project required tearing down a derelict apartment building erected in 1946.
Arrest warrants for the three men describe two different sets of allegations.
Mr. Applebaum is alleged to be part of a conspiracy between 2009 and 2011, with his chief of staff, Mr. Tremblay; and three executives from the engineering firm Dessau - Rosaire Sauriol, Patrice Laporte and Claude Asselin.
SOGEP, a Dessau subsidiary, is one of the stakeholders managing the NDG Sports Centre.
The warrant alleges that Mr. Applebaum arranged for a bribe from the three Dessau executives in exchange for a political favour. This exchange would have occurred between January, 2009, which coincides with the time former mayor Gerald Tremblay appointed Mr. Applebaum to Montreal's executive committee, and December, 2011. Urban planning was among the responsibilities Mr. Tremblay gave to Mr. Applebaum, a former real estate agent.
Mr. Asselin, a former executive director at the city of Laval, was arrested and accused of gangsterism alongside former Laval mayor Gilles Vaillancourt in early May. Mr. Sauriol, a former Dessau executive, appeared at the Charbonneau inquiry into the construction industry last March, testifying that Dessau colluded with other firms to split up infrastructure contracts in Montreal and used false invoices to illegally fund political parties.
Mr. Laporte is vice-president, operations and development, for Dessau in Ontario. Neither he nor Dessau spokeswoman Jessie-Kim Malo answered requests for comment Monday.
In the other set of allegations in the warrants, Mr. Applebaum is accused of having arranged bribes with two Montreal businessmen, Robert Stein and Anthony Keeler, between 2006 and 2010, in return for approving a project.
Mr. Applebaum's chief of staff in the borough, Hugo Tremblay, is named in the warrant as a co-conspirator but not charged. Neither Mr. Keeler nor Mr. Stein are charged. Corporate records list them as directors of 7681160 Canada Inc., a firm headquartered at 5450 Côte-des-Neiges Street, which runs in the centre of Mr. Applebaum's former borough. Also listed at that same address is Eagle Investments.
Mr. Stein started running Eagle Investments, a commercial real estate company that was founded by his grandfather Sam, in 2006, shortly after his father David died. He was 24 at the time. "I was thrown into the fire," he said in an online family business page.
But real estate is not the only concern for Mr. Stein who, since 2001, is also a partner in a mixed martial arts management company. One of his companies, Gestion 5255-75 Ferrier Inc., owns the property housing Tristar Gym, where martial-arts champion George St-Pierre trains.
Mr. Stein did not return calls left at his office and no one answered the phone at his home.
Court documents identify the late David Stein as "a close business partner" of a controversial developer, Antonio Magi, who, according to RCMP affidavits, has ties with members of the Rizzuto crime family.
Last January, Mr. Applebaum was asked about a controversial condo project in west end Montreal, near Upper Lachine Rd. and Wilson Rd., which was promoted by Mr. Magi.
Mr. Applebaum told reporters that he knew Mr. Magi as a developer but hadn't seen him since 2008. "I am an honest person, with integrity and I have nothing to apologize for. You cannot buy me," Mr. Applebaum told reporters at city hall.
The next month, UPAC officers conducted search warrants at city hall and in six borough offices. In March, Robert Rousseau, the director of the NDG borough's division of permits and inspections, killed himself hours after being questioned by UPAC investigators.

Full text:   Housing numbers this week will test effectiveness of measures to rein in buyers' enthusiasm
The Canadian Real Estate Association will release data on Monday about the number of homes that changed hands in May, and it's likely to provide more evidence that policy-makers have pulled off a soft landing in the market - for now.
It's a fine line. The steep sales slump that began last summer, after Finance Minister Jim Flaherty tightened the mortgage insurance rules, appears to be ending. But if the market picks up too quickly, Mr. Flaherty could be forced to pour cold water on it again.
The central bank warned last week that the housing market and high consumer debt loads are still the biggest threats facing the economy. It cited some positive developments since last year: Sales activity has fallen and levelled off, housing starts have moderated and house prices are no longer rising in most cities.
But it added that there are still signs of overbuilding, particularly in downtown Toronto, where a large pool of unsold condo units has accumulated. If the developers who are constructing these units can't find buyers, it might trigger a drop in prices that could spread to other parts of the housing market and infect the economy.
While the central bank continues to warn of the dangers, economists are increasingly willing to declare victory over the threat of a housing crash in the near-term. "Canada's housing market is cooling, but gradually and in line with policy-maker objectives," Moody's senior economist Mark Hopkins said in a research note on Friday.
"Fears that Canadian housing is a bubble about to pop are premature," he wrote, adding that some price declines will be necessary to bring demand inline with supply. Monday's data are expected to show that prices are still rising, but not at the pace that they had been last year.
Bank of Montreal economist Benjamin Reitzes is looking for May's national sales to come in 2.7-per-cent lower than last year, which he noted would be "the smallest drop since October and a big improvement over the 10-per-cent year-over-year decline through the first four months of the year."
Based on data that have already been released by local real estate boards, May's sales were 3.4-per-cent lower than last year in Toronto and 7 per cent higher than last year in Calgary. Vancouver saw sales rise 1 per cent, the city's first positive showing in a long time.

Here, super agent Brad Lamb shares his advice on sticking out from the crowd, shutting your mouth and why your local bartender could be the best hire you ever make
If you can sell a martini,
you can probably sell a condo
Real estate is one of the few jobs today that is truly, 100-per-cent commission. It's a very special person who can survive in the eat what you kill market, and so I look for people who have a really positive aura about them and who are likable. Sales is really about creating and preserving relationships. I've actually hired a lot of bartenders. These are people who basically work on commission and who survive on their personality and ability to connect with customers. I have about five people who started working for me straight from working behind a bar and they have become tremendously successful real estate agents.
It's never baaaaad to stick out from the crowd
I know some people think my lamb ads are funny or creepy, but the main point is that they get people's attention and present a clear and simple message. I wanted to sort of make fun of the industry convention where real estate people put their picture and say they are the "number one" agent. How can all of these people be number one? They all sort of bleed together whereas my ads stick out.
Zip it to win it
After university I worked at a manufacturing facility. My boss was a classic 1950s, huckster-type sales guy. We used to do a lot of travelling together and he had this line where he would ask me, 'Hey Brad, what do you tell?' and the answer was, 'Enough to sell.' What it really means is shut your mouth. As a salesperson, learn to take the order and just be quiet. People think they have to talk so much to be effective, but the truth is you will learn a lot more by listening to people than by going on and on. I tell my employees that when in doubt, just shut up.

Full text:   They chucked the urban life for the splendours of a heritage home and a fast train to the city
Soon after moving from Toronto's ultra-hip Beaconsfield neighbourhood to Port Hope, Ont., Carl Swanston and Sarah Cashman met a prominent heritage architect who lives in the historic town on the edge of Lake Ontario.
The couple were just beginning the restoration of one of Port Hope's most storied mansions and Philip Goldsmith gave them a few words of advice.
"Don't overthink it," the architect advised. Just enjoy the house.
That simple wisdom, says the couple, was among the most valuable they received. One year after they took over its stewardship, Helm House appears to have benefited from the laissez-faire approach: The couple's renovation won the 2013 Heritage Port Hope award in the residential category.
And despite undertaking a massive renovation and commuting to work in Toronto, the couple has found time to settle into the community and get to know the neighbours. They enrolled their daughter Neala in junior kindergarten at Ganaraska Trail Public School. At Christmas, they adopted a cat from the local shelter. Now that June has come around again, Ms. Cashman pauses to enjoy the masses of lilacs in the garden. And Mr. Swanston carves out time to ride his vintage motorcycle through the rolling landscape of Northumberland County on Sunday mornings.
It was early 2012 when Ms. Cashman, who has a career in communications, and Mr. Swanston, who works in the news department at CBC, posed the question that many couples in Toronto's high-priced housing market ask: What if we cashed in our investment in Toronto real estate and opted for a different existence? The more they thought about it, the more it made sense to forgo the restaurants and nightlife of Queen Street West and search for a property with stunning architecture and space for their young daughter to run.
They found what they were looking for in a rambling, red-brick dwelling high on a hill above downtown Port Hope. They were introduced to Globe and Mail readers soon after - and right about the time they learned that the house is one of the rare ones protected by heritage conservation rules on the interior as well as the exterior.
After the initial panic - "we thought, let's just forfeit our deposit and walk away," Mr. Swanston said at the time - they plunged ahead.
They consulted Heritage Port Hope and learned that Helm House had been built circa 1858 in the Regency Villa style for a local lumber baron named Robert Charles Smith. After that, the family of John Henry Helm took over for a few generations. The last family to own it had been there since 1968.
The items that were protected - architectural elements such as the dramatic oak staircase, the panelled doors and the marble fireplace mantels - were the features that drew them in the first place.
As they began the work, the couple tried to be as non-interventionist as possible.
The renovation began with ripping up the accumulated materials of past attempts at modernization, including a 1970s-era kitchen and wall-to-wall broadloom covering the wood floors. Fixtures, tiles and accessories from a Mamie Eisenhower pink bathroom were carted away.
They pulled acoustic tiles down from the ceilings to uncover the original plaster medallions and mouldings.
Not long into the reno, it became apparent the first contractor wasn't going to work out. That hiring mistake cost them some money and time, says Mr. Swanston, but the couple decided to oversee the project themselves after that. They sought out local experts in carpentry, plastering and painting and quickly came to admire their devotion.
"These people are passionate," says Mr. Swanston.
Mr. Swanston also contributed his own labour as much as he could. He figures that his willingness to pitch in helped to keep that dedication from waning in the later days.
"If they see that you care - and you're sweating and getting your hands dirty - they'll care more," he says.
Heritage Port Hope chairman Rick Brooks dropped by often to provide his expertise in grand houses of the 19th century.
One surprising aspect of small-town living for Mr. Swanston was the number of neighbours who come by just to share memories of the house from years past.
"People knock on your door, out of the blue," he says. "'Hey, did you know a Hollywood actress lived here? She dated Elvis.'"
Sure enough, Mr. Swanston learned that Anne Helm, a descendent of John, had gone off to Los Angeles and become a film star.
After some online searching, Mr. Swanston found her still living in California and wrote to tell her about the rejuvenation of Helm House. The two have kept in touch ever since.
As visitors approach the house now, it doesn't look all that different from years past. The exterior trim has been painted, the fountain in the garden is working again and the wraparound porch has been made welcoming with yellow pansies and wicker chairs.
"As you walk in, nothing will jump at you," says Mr. Swanston. "We did a lot to the house, but it's hardly noticeable."
The biggest change is in a large principal room on the south side.
"It was like a big ballroom," says Ms. Cashman of the daunting space.
Now the room contains a spacious kitchen and an adjacent sitting area in front of the fireplace. The simple cabinets, painted white, are in keeping with those that an older house might have had. Windows look out onto the porch.
Maritime pendant light fixtures hang above the island.
"I learned from this house you buy everything extra, extra-large," says Mr. Swanston.
On the other side of the central hall, the living room has an elaborate plaster ceiling, which has now been repaired except for one or two hard-to-spot pieces missing around the edge. In the dining room, an old barn door was pulled out of the garage and now serves as a table.
Finding the right antique table has been put off to next year's schedule and budget, explains Mr. Swanston.
Upstairs, the couple created a master suite from two smaller rooms. By saving or reusing all of the doors and windows, they didn't run afoul of heritage rules.
In the main bathroom, the pink bathroom tiles have been replaced with more timeless white marble. The 1906 bathtub, made locally, was refinished. And now there's a double walk-in shower.
The second floor needed little else except for a light sanding of the wide pine floors and some paint, the couple explains.
At first, the couple tried to choose a paint palette in heritage colours. But a painter recommended that they choose a colour for the darkest winter day. That advice nudged them toward more vibrant hues and they are happy now with the choice.
"Make it happy for the winter - the summer will take care of itself," says Mr. Swanston.
Now that the renovation is finished, the couple is turning their attention to the garden.
But mostly they are enjoying inviting their friends and family for weekends at the big house surrounded by one acre of land. They recently held Neala's fifth birthday party on the lawn and entertained guests with old-fashioned games such aspin the tail on the donkey.
Since they've moved to small-town Ontario, the couple has tried to introduce their daughter to some of the simpler things in life, says Mr. Swanston. They walk to the beach for a picnic or visit the village of Roseneath, where kids ride brilliantly painted horses on an antique carousel. The most magical spectacle of the year, says Ms. Cashman, was the display of brightly festooned tractors and farm equipment during the Farmers' Christmas Parade of Lights.
Taking the VIA train to and from Toronto has gone smoothly, they both say, and they're able to accomplish a lot on their laptops during the commute.
The renovation, despite the glitches, produced no big surprises.
"I think every renovation project goes a little bit over budget and ours went a little over budget but not crazily," says Ms. Cashman.
"If I won the lottery, I wouldn't move, I'd put a pool in," says Mr. Swanston. "There are no regrets at all."

Abstract: I've eaten at Joe Beef, otherwise known as that place that serves foie gras double-down sandwiches, and loved it, and more than a few times at Au Pied de Cochon. I've consumed my body weight in smoked meat from Schwartz's, the treasured Jewish deli on Boulevard Saint-Laurent that serves what is arguably the greatest sandwich on Earth, extra fatty please, with a Cott's cherry soda. They are unique and terrific and unforgettably tasty; I highly recommend them.

Full text:   If you were to make a game of identifying cities based on their most popular ingredients, which one would get morel and porcini mushrooms, stacks of fresh, feathery mint and underused but delicious herbs like sorrel and lovage?
What city would serve them with affordable, natural wines, with crisp, supernally flavourful vegetables, with cold-water shrimp and urchin so fresh that they can't be more than a few hours out of the sea?
Vancouver, right? Or maybe San Francisco. But definitely not Montreal, which is best-known these days for its whole pigs? trotters stuffed with foie gras and its kill-me-now poutines. The city's maximalist, live-well-and-keel-over-at-60 culinary brand is easily one of Quebec?s most influential cultural exports.
Anthony Bourdain once cheerfully described his first-ever meal at Au Pied de Cochon, the home of that foie-stuffed trotter, as being so excessive that he passed out before he was done.
I've eaten at Joe Beef, otherwise known as that place that serves foie gras double-down sandwiches, and loved it, and more than a few times at Au Pied de Cochon. I've consumed my body weight in smoked meat from Schwartz's, the treasured Jewish deli on Boulevard Saint-Laurent that serves what is arguably the greatest sandwich on Earth, extra fatty please, with a Cott's cherry soda. They are unique and terrific and unforgettably tasty; I highly recommend them.
Yet after an extended eating trip to the city earlier this month, I'm convinced that what Montreal does best - what makes it one of North America's greatest dining towns - are the restaurants that get far less love and attention internationally, the places where chic, in-the-know locals go.
They are the superb neighbourhood bistros, the cheap, convivial experimental kitchens and the modern, distinctly Montralais rooms that specialize in what's sometimes called bistronomie: in light, fresh cooking that's grounded (with some exceptions) in the classics but alive with new ideas. Given that the city has one of the continent's best farmers markets (Marche Jean-Talon; see sidebar) and provisioners (Societe-Orignal, among others), it's no surprise that these restaurants- menus are often market-driven too.
In Montreal? Absolutely. And many of them also serve pork and foie gras, in case you were worried, though generally not in portions that are likely to K.O. you in the middle of a meal.
Lawrence (5201 Boul. Saint-Laurent, 514-503-1070; lawrencerestaurant.com) opened a couple of years ago in a neighbourhood room that looks out on Mile End, a rewarding Bixi ride northwest of Montreal's downtown. The feel is unpretentious, cheery elegance, with worn wood floors and mismatched china plates balancing pop-modern design details.
Chef Marc Cohen's cooking is British by way of France and the Mediterranean, with classic Quebec ingredients, which is to say it's modern bistro cooking, tuned to Ici, as Radio-Canada might put it. Cohen does a verdant, jardin potager- style risotto with pureed lovage: green, peppery, creamy decadence with freshness where you'd expect to find heavy. His take on calamari was perhaps the best I've had; tender rings and tentacles with asparagus-like sea samphire and roast tomatoes, all tossed in garlicky aioli.
Cohen builds his superb rabbit terrine from mild meat and pistachios, and serves it with prunes refreshed in Calvados. The house agnolotti, dressed under morel mushrooms and asparagus and cheesy butteriness, were extraordinarily good. These are simple dishes, but done with a degree of love and expertise that a lesser kitchen just couldn't fake.
Cohen's take on pot-au-feu was a marvel of poise and texture, a meat feast without the gouts of fat or 4 a.m. sweats. It included silky veal tongue and tail braised to moist and wobbly, and a hunk of sausage that was fragrant with woodsmoke. There was sublime dark broth around them, the slap and warm blush of radish slices, and on top, a creamy mustard countermovement from Dijon.
We had apple and gin sorbet for dessert - simple, delicious, highly effective. It was the sort of place I can't wait to go back to.
Some chefs write a menu at the start of their careers and rarely change it; at Foodlab (1201 Boul. Saint-Laurent, 514-844-2033, sat.qc.ca/en/foodlab), an enormous, often party-like indoor-outdoor space, classically trained chefs Michelle Marek and Seth Gabrielse cook an entirely new cuisine each month. They've done Swedish smorgasbord and Russian Easter, among many others. Last month, their wine and food menus were built around Greek dishes, and when I visited last week they had only just switched to a Jerusalem theme.
On their menu: grilled halloumi cheese with tomatoes and honey, superb beef shawarmas, excellent mezze, an octopus salad with impressively creamy labneh that came dusted with za'atar, the smoky, citrusy spice. It tasted as though they?d been cooking the food of Jerusalem all their lives.
A few blocks east down a grotty stretch of Saint-Laurent, Bouillon Bilk (1595 Boul. Saint-Laurent, 514-845-1595; bouillonbilk.com) quickly became a chefs' favourite after opening in the spring of 2011. Helmed by hyper-talented chef François Nadon, the modern little room, with its linen-napped tables, thoughtful wine list (the place sells vin jaune by the glass, as well as Irancy from northern Burgundy; terroiristes should run, not walk) and friendly, neighbourhood vibe, has staked out an inspiring synthesis of bistro and fine dining.
Nadon's plates are often breathtaking. His lobster bisque with fresh urchin and crispy, endorphin-priming chicken skin was a $6 special when I ate there, four sublime, pace-setting, land-sea slurps to put his guests on high alert. He dressed a primi-sized bowl of house linguine with thinly sliced veal tongue that was brined with fennel and coriander, much like Jewish deli meat, and with a drift of fresh horseradish and porcini mushrooms bathed in butter and melting stracchino cheese. For every darker element, Nadon balanced off a light one: sliced red grapes, spring peas and preserved lemons, for instance, with pan-roasted bass.
My favourite, though, was his northern Chinese-style duck dumpling, which turned up seared, in a shallow pool of broth, topped with pickled daikon strands and thin, deep burgundy-coloured slices of duck's heart. It was Montreal French with a Cantonese accent, intense pleasure and progressivism in a bowl.
L'Express (3927 Rue Saint-Denis, 514-845-5333; restaurantlexpress.ca), a 32-year-old institution in the fashionable Plateau neighbourhood, is a proper French bistro, run by a chef from Toulouse and a remarkably enlightened owner who still writes the menus with a fountain pen. It is packed from 8 a.m. to 2 a.m. most days, with minor celebrities (isn't that the guy from the "Ici c'est Pepsi" commercials?), scruffy off-shift cooks, wine-loving businessmen, families and smartly dressed couples who are not averse to affectionate public displays.
The plats here come with enormous jars of bracing cornichons and pots - yes, pots - of mustard. L'Express's wine cellar is 11,000 bottles strong, and as in France, many of those bottles come up for sale only when they're ready, at prices meant to encourage fraternité and egalité . The chef does not glad hand with his guests.
And the cooking? It is French bistro cooking: superb calf's liver seared hard to medium rare, with good frites and house-made mayo; fish soup stirred with garlicky aioli and crumbly cheese toasts; asperges vinaigrette ; pitch-perfect tarte au citron . It's sensational for its lack of sensationalism, exactly what an honest bistro is.
A friend of mine seemed charmed when I told him how much I loved it. L'Express is his go-to place. "The secret about L'Express is that the cooking's not great-great, it's just always really good," he said.
Exactly right.

Full text:   It could be a scene plucked from a retirement planning commercial: retirees taking a morning stroll on one of Mexico's pristine beaches, sipping lattes in a quaint French town or playing golf year-round on a lush Florida course. For many Canadians, the dream of retiring abroad, either part- or full-time, is the ultimate goal.
Today's seniors are living longer and leading more active lives than those of their parents or grandparents, says Susan Eng, vice-president of advocacy for the Toronto-based seniors' advocacy organization CARP. And many are refusing to live the stereotypically quiet lives associated with being a senior. "They're undertaking challenges that many of us might not take, like relocating to another country. It's not trivial or a guided tour, it really changes the dynamics of their life."
Warm, dry weather and affordability were the main drivers that prompted Phil and Marg Timmons, a Barrie, Ont.-based couple, to begin exploring retirement options outside Canada about five years ago. The couple, now retired and in their early 60s, were tired of shovelling snow, so they set their sights on property ownership in Arizona.
After spending months researching the tax, legal and property ownership implications, they took the plunge, capitalizing on the weak housing market in the Sun City area northwest of Phoenix. With the help of a Canadian real estate agent who specializes in helping snowbirds buy property in Arizona, they bought a home in an adult-living community just minutes from shopping malls, golf courses and other amenities.
They've spent the past several winters enjoying and maximizing the 182 days Canadians are allowed to remain in the United States during any 12-month period. "We both feel better living in Arizona," Mr. Timmons explains. "We golf in sweaters in December and January and weather-wise, it's perfect. We also picked Arizona because it has different scenery. There seemed to be more activities and sightseeing with mountains and the desert. There's just a variety of things to do."
Rod Burylo, national marketing director with Calgary-based Axcess Capital Advisors and a specialist in international retirement topics, says living abroad in retirement is often mistakenly viewed as the domain of the ultra-rich. But in many cases, snowbirds are settling in towns such as Ajijic - a lakeside town in Mexico's Jalisco state that's become home to a growing community of Canadian and U.S. expatriates - because of cheap rents and an affordable lifestyle.
"You can retire comfortably there on $2,000 a month, depending on whether you rent or buy," Mr. Burylo explains. "If a retired couple are on a Canada pension, they could comfortably retire and that includes being able to eat out every night. Having that lifestyle in Canada ... wouldn't be possible."
But Mr. Burylo reminds Canadian retirees that they need to take steps to ensure they're making the right decision to relocate in their golden years. His first recommendation: Find an accountant who specializes in international tax law and have him or her work closely with their financial planner to ensure compliance and reap any and all possible tax benefits.
Unlike Americans, he explains, Canadians are not taxed based on citizenship, but residency. That means retirees who live abroad full-time can take themselves out of the Canadian tax system and - local legislation permitting - be subject to the tax laws of their adopted retirement home.
Perhaps the greatest concern for retirees is health insurance.
As Mark Anevich, director of business development with CAA Travel Insurance explains, many insurers do sell products catering to Canadians who live abroad during retirement that insure for costs in excess of what would be covered under their provincial health insurance plan when outside of the country - which is typically only a small fraction of the sometimes staggering medical costs they might incur.
"For that reason," Mr. Anevich explains, "snowbirds need travel insurance to avoid a potential financial disaster should they require emergency medical treatment while outside of their home province."
While these concerns may seem overwhelming at first, the Timmonses - who have come to rely on Skype to communicate with family - say they were easier to navigate than first expected.
Still, they offer this piece of advice to other retirees contemplating retirement abroad: "Give yourself lots of time," advises Mr. Timmons. "Put time on your side instead of rushing into it."

A $12.8-million penthouse, full of potential, but still seeking a buyer

Full text:   Perched above a prized urban crossroads, the MuseumHouse space could become one of Toronto's great apartment homes
jmays@globeandmail.com
It's been almost seven years since the two-level suite at the top of MuseumHouse, located on Bloor Street a few steps west of Avenue Road, appeared on the local condominium market.
At one point, Toronto investor Sheldon Esbin and his development partners on the MuseumHouse project tried to sweeten the penthouse deal by throwing in a life-sized Rodin sculpture. No deal.
Then, in 2010, Sol Wassermuhl, the 19-storey building's architect, commissioned three interior design firms - Powell & Bonnell, Munge Leung and Patty Xenos - to come up with schemes to help prospective buyers imagine what the 5,700-square-foot apartment could look like when fully outfitted. (The sketches were described in these pages by Carolyn Ireland.) Still, no buyer materialized.
These days, Mr. Esbin and Mr. Wassermuhl are at it again, looking for a customer ready to pay the asking price of $12.8-million and well-heeled enough to spend more millions on floors, ceilings, walls, appliances and furnishings.
But there's a difference this time around.
In previous years, the developers had nothing more substantial than drawings and renderings to show interested parties.
Now, however, MuseumHouse is almost ready for the homeowners to start moving in. (Mr. Esbin and Mr. Wassermuhl, incidentally, will be among the first.)
One can walk around the penthouse at last, that is, and get a vivid, real-world idea of what it would be like to call this place home. Which I did, a couple of weeks ago, accompanied by the architect.
Calling it home would mean living somewhere that is almost entirely kitted-out according to the owner's tastes in matters of spatial flow, finishes, appointments.
The apartment, at present, is a gaunt expanse of glass and concrete, its rooms and utility outlets only roughed in. A timid soul might be put off by the rawness of the space. But for people with imagination, or with the ability to hire imagination, the suite might be the large, empty canvas they've been looking for.
Calling it home would also mean enjoying some of the best big-city, big-sky views available anywhere in Toronto.
Looking south through the tall glass walls of the living room or from the south-facing terrace, the eye is carried out over the roof of the Royal Ontario Museum, and across the leafy, low-rise cityscape of the University of Toronto's St. George campus and of the residential neighbourhoods beyond. The altitude of the living room, at the 18th floor, is just right, Mr. Wassermuhl pointed out. Seen from much higher, the city's textured surface would flatten out like a map.
Much lower, and the viewer would find himself down among the facades of the museum and the Royal Conservatory.
This attractive prospect will probably remain as wide and tower-free as it is today - unless, that is, the museum drops, as it has threatened to do, a tall condo building on the site of the mothballed McLaughlin Planetarium, or unless skyscrapers go up on College Street.
Neither event is likely to happen in the near term, however, so the fine southerly views from MuseumHouse can reasonably be expected to last a long time.
Like the lower level, the upper storey of the penthouse opens toward the south, and both face north, with glass-walled vistas over the mix of old high-rises and single-family Victorian homes that make up the Annex. (The two levels are connected by a floating, curving staircase and by an elevator.)
The east wall of the apartment is also glass, though the view in this direction will soon be blocked by architect Rosario Varacalli's Exhibit, an unusual, twisting 32-storey condo tower that is now under construction.
In contrast to this tall, eccentric next-door neighbour, Mr. Wassermuhl's MuseumHouse - on the outside, anyway - is a plain and undistinguished modernist box.
But while it contributes nothing to the contemporary conversation about tower style, the building has certain assets that will surely be taken into account by anyone thinking of living there. (Prices of available units start at around $1.6-million.)
One, of course, is the address, which will appeal to some.
It's at the heart of Toronto's staid, establishment culture - the Royal Ontario Museum and the Gardiner Museum of Ceramic Art, with the Art Gallery of Ontario not far away - and very near the staid, establishment shops of Yorkville and Bloor Street West. (The cutting edge lies elsewhere in the city.)
Another asset is the relative intimacy of MuseumHouse.
There are only 27 suites in the whole building, the lobby is small, the entrance is so understated a passerby might miss it. (I did, the first time I went looking for it.)
But to return to the topic of the penthouse: It will be interesting to see if it finds a buyer after all these years.
The suite certainly has the potential - the views and especially the spatial generosity - to become one of Toronto's great apartment homes.

LISTING AGENT
Julie Kinnear, Royal LePage Real Estate Services Ltd.
The Action: In the heart of Roncesvalles Village, this century-old, brick townhouse was the object of the affections of more than a dozen house hunters with enough conviction to write an offer, including one proposing $152,877 on top of the list price.
What They Got: The last two owners of this 1,410-square-foot townhouse invested in various updates, from installing a new roof, mechanics and detached garage to renovating two bathrooms and open kitchen and family room with slate floors, granite counters, stainless steel appliances, tin ceiling and a patio door.
* The balance of the house is traditional with classic wood floors in a fireside living room, dining area and two out of three bedrooms upstairs. The 700-square-foot basement was dug out and designed with a recreation area, storage and laundry facilities and two exits to the 15-by 125-foot grounds and rear laneway.
The Agent's Take: "Roncesvalles is really the hopping spot and this is halfway between Roncesvalles where all the restaurants are and ... where all the kids hang out, a dog park and farmer's market," says agent and local resident, Julie Kinnear, who rarely fields 14 offers in the area or other parts of the city.
"We hit the market at a good time when there wasn't a lot of inventory, and it was a very special house that spoke to people."
For instance, buyers appreciated old and new components equally.
"There are a number of row houses in groups of three, but this particular group has that cute turret-look, so that added great appeal because it was architecturally unique," Ms. Kinnear explains.
"It was really well renovated, it had an extra addition on the main floor and the basement had walkouts from the front and back."

Full text:   Purchasers lovingly restored and refined their significant piece of a 1950s architectural innovation
daveleblanc@globeandmail.com
Although Calgary wasn't the metropolis it is today, Cowtowners were ready to see the future of residential architecture in April, 1954.
As part of the cross-Canada "trend house" program (sponsored by various British Columbia lumber manufacturers), the premonition came in the form of a sleek, low-slung dwelling tucked gently into a pie-shaped lot a stone's throw from the Elbow River.
Presenting itself to the street as a one-storey, shed-roofed home with few windows, local legend has it that folks dubbed the Calgary trend house the "chicken coop" while it was going up in 1953. After lining up to view it, however, they weren't clucking their disapproval: Saving the big windows for a view of the private backyard, the tens of thousands of visitors were dazzled by a symphony of natural light, an open floor plan, a big built-in sideboard with attached planter in the dining room, a generous kitchen, and, separated by a glazed hallway, a two-storey wing that contained the bedrooms.
The future, in other words, looked very, very good.
However, the postwar oil orgy brought increasingly sophisticated people and architecture to the region and, by the late 20th century, the trend house was all but forgotten. In 2001, when Michael Kurtz and Jennifer McColl walked through it, "lavender was a key colour of the living room," and the dining area reminded them of "a hotel circa 1982," they laugh. The home's strong exterior lines had been emasculated by a whitewash of that "bluey-white" primer, there were water penetration issues, and some original interior details, such as light fixtures, were long gone.
The good news, however, was that some original - and futuristic - features, while a little worn out, were intact: the low-voltage, electronic light switches that allowed occupants to turn a dial in any room to dim any lamp; the big, bold fireplace made from speckled, heatproof Saskatchewan brick used in blast furnaces; the etched wood panelling in the dining room; an unpainted western red cedar living-room ceiling held aloft by Douglas fir glulam beams (an early use of this technology); a front door that opened at grade; and arborite-clad bathroom walls.
The other bit of good news is that Mr. Kurtz, an industrial designer, and Ms. McColl, a museum studies post-grad, had just come home to Calgary after living in San Francisco, where modernist home builder Joseph Eichler's postwar post-and-beam homes had been making a 21st-century comeback, so they were able to wave off warnings from family and friends advising them not to purchase. Besides, when a realtor told them the home was some sort of "award winner" and the firm responsible was the highly respected Rule Wynn and Rule, they suspected they'd stumbled upon something special.
So, after languishing on the market for almost a year and a half, Mr. Kurtz and Ms. McColl purchased the home in 2002 and, slowly, pieced together its story.
"It didn't take much digging," says Mr. Kurtz with a laugh. It's true: With the Canadian Architectural Archives at the University of Calgary at their disposal, back issues of the Calgary Herald and, eventually, a scan of the vintage trend house brochure "Western Woods presents 10 Canadian trend houses" courtesy of Winnipeg-based architect Jim Wagner, the puzzle fell together nicely.
Over the next decade, via online chats with other Canadian architecture aficionados, more pieces: The couple learned the fate of the two Toronto houses (the first one, which spawned the others, was exhibited in Etobicoke in 1952, featured in this space in 2004 and demolished in 2006; the second, in Lawrence Park, still stands and was featured here in 2005); witnessed a valiant battle to save the Montreal house (demolished in 2011, featured here in 2006) and visited the owners of the Victoria house in January, 2012 (also good stewards).
Of course, during that time, the couple didn't just study trend-house history, they restored and refined their very significant piece of it ... one project at a time. A new kitchen followed the layout of the old; a slate-look floor was installed in the living and dining areas; poorly insulated walls in the master and second bedrooms came down for new insulation and electrical; the master bath was reconfigured to allow for a larger tub (people were shorter 60 years ago); long-overdue landscaping and fence-building was done; and, finally, the house was painted in hues that highlight its modernist lines.
Soon, the couple hopes to rebuild the sinking garage (separated from the house by a breezeway) to original specifications, but with a wider opening "so we don't scratch the mirrors of our car," says Ms. McColl with a chuckle.
It's an easy, happy home to live in, and it suits this easygoing, happy couple - married now for two decades - and their two furry friends so well, they've documented their journey at calgarymcm.com. And, since they've seen what can happen when history is forgotten, they assisted the City of Calgary in listing their home on the Inventory of Evaluated Historic Resources in early 2012.
"It's hard to imagine not being in this house," finishes Ms. McColl, "where there aren't 80 panes of glass, where there isn't all this light; it really is that special.
"But I think if we hadn't bought it, it wouldn't be here."

Full text:   Build Toronto, set up to develop and sell the city's surplus land, is in turmoil after multiple departures from its board and allegations that the mayor's brother is trying to hand-pick the new chief executive for the arm's-length agency.
Six independent directors - five real-estate executives and one architect - have left or are about to leave the 13-member board. That includes the exit two weeks ago of chairman Stuart Lazier and the recent resignations of the two other independent directors serving on the committee seeking a new CEO, leaving Councillor Doug Ford as its only member.
Mr. Ford, vice-chair of Build Toronto, has stepped in as chair of the board, which includes two city employees and two city councillors from the mayor's executive committee. Only two independent directors remain.
A months-long search for a new CEO to replace real-estate veteran Lorne Braithwaite has been derailed, three sources familiar with the process say, by Mr. Ford. The sources say Mr. Ford has pushed to give the job to Toronto Port Lands CEO Michael Kraljevic.
The upheaval has some questioning Build Toronto's future and its ability to attract talent from the real-estate industry.
The agency, formed at the recommendation of a blue-ribbon panel four years ago, was envisioned as a way for the city get more value from its large property portfolio by entering into joint ventures with private developers rather than just selling surplus parcels of land. Its many projects include a site at Yonge Street and York Mills Road set to become an office building, as well as a $295-million joint venture with Tridel for a condo tower at the foot of York Street.
While it has generated millions for the city, Build Toronto has its critics on council. Its private-sector-style salaries and bonuses put its executives at a pay scale not enjoyed by other city staff and the size and design of some projects - such as the York Street condo - initially upset local residents.
Asked about the changes at Build Toronto, Mr. Lazier confirmed his decision to leave was sudden, saying it was "for personal reasons."
Mr. Ford declined to answer questions about his role in the CEO search. Asked about the board turnover, he said, "You'd better talk to the board."
Other board members said the disruption at Build Toronto is partly the result of board terms coming to an end and the departure of its leader. It's not clear that all of the board members who are leaving are doing so because of the CEO issue.
"Any time there is a search to put a new CEO in place, everybody wants to get their person in," said Councillor Michael Thompson, a member of the Build Toronto board who is not a member of the search committee.
Mr. Thompson stressed no one has been chosen for the CEO post. He said the job is difficult to fill because it requires industry experience as well as an ability to balance the need to increase returns on land sales with the desires of councillors and local residents. The agency cannot just look to get the highest dollar, it also needs to leverage the sale of land to create city-building opportunities, he said.
For that reason, he said a "top dog," from the industry may not be an appropriate choice. "We have to figure a way forward," Mr. Thompson said. "There is a huge balancing act."
A list of new directors is expected to go to city council at its meeting next week. Two of the independent directors who are leaving have completed their four-year terms and have decided not to serve again.
Until the new directors are in place, the board will not pick a new CEO, said several directors, who confirmed Mr. Kraljevic is a candidate.
Even without an appointment, the shortlisting of Mr. Kraljevic is raising alarm bells with some councillors because of the role the Toronto Port Lands played in Mr. Ford's efforts to take control of development in the eastern harbour from Waterfront Toronto.
That plan, which Mr. Ford mused could include a Ferris wheel and megamall, would have shifted control of the city land to Toronto Port Lands, from Waterfront Toronto, an agency controlled by three levels of government.
Councillor Paula Fletcher, who led the fight against Mr. Ford's Port Lands vision, worries with his handpicked leader in charge of Build Toronto, the battle over development on the waterfront could begin again.
"I think we could have a collision course here and it really makes me concerned," Ms. Fletcher said.
Mr. Thompson said whoever becomes the new leader of Build Toronto will need a range of skills beyond real-estate experience. "The job has changed," he said.

Full text:   Don't just check the Parthenon off your list and leave. Despite economic upheaval, the gritty city is full of charm
If you're going to Greece this year, chances are you'll pass through Athens. You'll probably stay a night, see the Parthenon and then leave quickly. Few visitors have much good to say about the Greek capital: It is busy, chaotic, dingy - a real culture shock when landing from Europe's tidier, more picturesque cities. Most travellers arrive thinking that they have come to the land built by Pericles and are quickly disappointed by the endless sprawl of concrete blocks that blanket the mountainsides. Unwieldy, anarchic Athens has more in common with Beirut and Istanbul than it does with Paris and London.
In the early 2000s, just before the Olympics, Athens cleaned up its act and began promoting itself as a well-groomed Western European capital. The tidiness lasted less than a year, and the current economic crisis means that the city is back to looking more like a Middle Eastern metropolis. Then came the apocalyptic news headlines, and clips of riots and endless strikes, which further discouraged visitors.
That's a shame because Athens is a fascinating city. Beyond some of the oldest and most important monuments in the world, it boasts some of the best cafes on the continent and a nightlife that rivals any of its Mediterranean neighbours. If given a chance, Athens can be enchanting.
Here's the first rule for visiting Athens: Don't stay in a hotel anywhere near Omonia Square, ground zero for the hardship that afflicts the city these days. Instead, stay around Syntagma Square and Plaka. I like to stay at the Dryades Hotel in the Exarchia neighbourhood, a steep walk uphill but on a quiet street that offers amazing views.
I usually start my day with an espresso on the patio of Tailor Made, a roastery that serves the best coffee in the city. I once heard that Greeks are the slowest coffee drinkers in the world and that might just be true given how long they can make a cup of espresso last at their table. Prices for coffee are high, but you're paying for the patio real estate, not the drink itself, and EUR3 means you can linger all day reading Zorba the Greek .
Athens's central market is definitely worth a visit, with its astounding array of seafood and opportunities to tuck in. Just beware of the old ladies throwing elbows while you admire the piles of giant squids, sardines, smelts and octopuses. I like to grab a bite at one of the many grills inside the market that serve small plates of fresh fish and hot peppers. Join the locals for a late-morning tipple of tsipouro , a strong grape-based spirit, with your snack.
This brings me to my second rule: Avoid eating in well-known spots such as Plaka and Monastiraki. Plastic menus in multiple languages and swarthy hosts who call at you to come inside their restaurant abound. Greek food is similar in most eateries - it's the quality that varies widely. Taking a few steps outside the tourist area will significantly reduce the price and increase the flavour of any meal. I head to Vergina in Exarchia, a simple taverna serving home-cooked food a grandmother would make. Try the village salad, white bean stew, stuffed peppers and braised beef that melts off the bone with a cold Mythos beer. I also like O Skoufias in Gazi, another traditional taverna that does excellent lamb.
In the afternoon - assuming you have already made the obligatory Parthenon visit - wander through the barren area under the Acropolis that was once the agora where Socrates held forth. Stroll up the path to Filopappou Hill for an amazing vista: From here you can see all of Athens, from the Mediterranean port of Piraeus to the ring of mountains in the north. The walk is also guaranteed to work off your lunch.
On the road that rings the Parthenon you'll find the Acropolis Museum. Opened in 2009, it is a stunning tribute to ancient Greek civilization. Look through the large windows and the 360-degree panoramic view and wonder how the various pieces of marble on display once fit into the Parthenon. The museum also has the nicest patio in the city, and serves delicious, reasonably priced food. It's not a bad way to spend a lazy afternoon admiring the birth of Western civilization.
As evening rolls in, sunset atop Lykavittos hill is a must (take a taxi), followed by dinner at Ep Avli, an elegant restaurant with a rooftop patio in the quiet, middle-class Pagrati neighbourhood. The economic crisis has shortened the lineups, but the grilled fish remains excellent at this converted 19th-century mansion.
I typically start my night in Psyrri, a storied working-class neighbourhood that explodes with tables spilling onto the road. At Psyrra (Greek for flea) bar, the raki is extraordinarily cheap by the carafe (share it with the table). A giant bowl of nuts helps to soothe your tongue and vital organs after imbibing the firewater. For a classier drink, the cafes of Thissio offer fantastic sight lines of the Parthenon. Nearby, two of the most atmospheric bars in the world - Six D.O.G.S. and T.A.F. - pack in guests every night of the week. Both are built into the secret courtyards of dilapidated but charming 19th-century buildings with mutilevel seating and an eclectic, artistic crowd. By day, the open-air hangouts double as art and music spaces.
From here the night splits in two. For a quieter evening, head up the cobblestone Apostolou Pavlou road toward the Parthenon entrance. A dark path through the trees will lead you to the Pnyx, a hill where early Athenians held their popular assemblies and where democracy got its start. Little known to outsiders, the rocky outcrop offers a close-up view of the Acropolis as you listen to young Greeks strumming guitars, drinking beers and singing with friends. Another idea is to catch a film at the outdoor Cine Thisio, which CNN deemed the most enjoyable movie theatre in the world.
For a more lively night, head to Kerameikos, also called Gazi, the ancient potters' quarter from where the word "ceramic" is derived. These days, it's the central bar and club district. It can be startling, given the sheer number of people and bars blaring every type of music imaginable. Mamacas is a perennial favourite. The neighbourhood also features some of the city's best restaurants, and is home to Athens's gay district. But even here - amid flashing strobe lights and glittering lounges - the economic crunch is plainly visible: bargoers milk one drink, fewer venues open all night as they once did and others have disappeared. Athens is a city under siege - and it shows.
Which is why my last rule is perhaps the most important: Come with an open mind and expect a little chaos. Any other city would have collapsed under the weight of crippling austerity, but Athenians, who have survived Persian attack, Ottoman occupation and military dictatorship, will be the first to let you know they have seen worse.

Full text:   Thomas Mihalik stands at the busy front of his men's clothing store, bidding goodbye to a rabbi from the small synagogue down the block on Baldwin Street.
Mr. Mihalik's father opened the store in 1958, a time when the Jewish character of Kensington Market was still somewhat intact. Since then, Tom's Place has grown to take over four narrow storefronts. That makes it one of the larger establishments in the cramped confines of this diverse and busy warren west of Spadina Avenue, between College and Dundas streets.
But even at four storefronts, Tom's Place stands to be dwarfed by what could be Kensington's newest merchant.
The spectre of a Wal-Mart on the outskirts of Kensington loomed over the market this week after RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust re-submitted plans to build a three-storey, 130,000-square-foot retail complex on Bathurst Street south of College Street. This time around, RioCan has confirmed rumours that Wal-Mart would be the chief tenant, with a smaller downtown version of its suburban store model occupying the top two storeys.
Last year, Toronto's committee of adjustment - and then the Ontario Municipal Board - rejected what was essentially the same proposal, saying its size and bulk would demand a zoning by-law amendment. The real estate investment trust is now requesting one, which means city councillors, and locals, will weigh in.
Area councillor Mike Layton says that while Toronto's official plan does call for development on major "avenues" such as Bathurst, there are other aspects of the development that are in "direct contradiction" with the plan.
"We don't put big-box retail in the middle of areas with vibrant economies. And we don't put car-dependent uses in areas with good public transit," says Mr. Layton.
"The size of the retail space is not appropriate," he adds. "We're going to have to send that message from community council."
Councillors won't be the only people getting a say this time around. The proposal will now be subject to community input, one thing that's never out of stock under the storefront awnings of Kensington.
Mr. Mihalik does not welcome the multinational discount department store. "There will be competition," he says, expressing concern for the area's many grocers. "Years ago, the market was the only place you could buy ethnic food. Even going back to when that meant rye bread and garlic. But now, the larger stores have caught on."
Around the corner on Augusta Avenue, grocer Cecilia Espinoza grimaces from behind a small counter when told about the reapplication. She's owned Latin America Emporium for 23 years, but says business isn't what it used to be, in part because of competition from larger stores. "Whatever we sell, they sell," she says. "But they buy by the container, I buy boxes. If they go 100 per cent on the markup I have to go only 35 per cent to compete."
It's the fate of these independent grocers that most worries Dominique Russell from Friends of Kensington Market. "There's a reason they call it 'The Wal-Mart Effect,'" says Ms. Russell, explaining the theory that Wal-Mart outlets succeed by driving smaller competitors out of business.
Produce sellers "are the heart of the market," says Ms. Russell. "They also have the thinnest margins and are the most vulnerable to competition and high rents."
She says these independent stores keep the market a unique neighbourhood. "When we shop at a neighbour's store, the money stays in the community," says Ms. Russell. "That's not the case with Wal-Mart. It will be sucking money out of a community and putting it in a corporation."
Though opposition seems to be the majority stance, in true Kensington anarchist fashion, countering views are available.
Among the folk art and one-of-a-kind clothing packing the racks and displays of Courage My Love on Kensington Avenue, a shopper approaches the counter to ask about the fit of the white formal shirt he's trying on.
Owner Cece Scriver nods approval. The customer retreats and Ms. Scriver explains that the stocking of formal attire is a holdover from the mid-seventies. When her parents started the store, they sold what their friends needed. Their friends were artists, so obviously they needed formal wear - for the catering jobs they held by night.
Ms. Scriver isn't exactly in favour of having a Wal-Mart on Bathurst, but she expresses a confidence in the resiliency of the unique stores of the neighbourhood that's been her home since she was born.
"I buy socks at Wal-Mart," confesses Ms. Scriver. "But we do it differently here. There have always been people who say, 'I'm going to come in and blow Kensington Market out of the water,'" she says. "In the end, the market changes them."
"Let people shop there," she says, welcoming comparisons. "We'll only look better."

Full text:   Rich with transit, office space and a crowd of young buyers, the area known as 'Young and Eligible' is the new hot spot of Toronto's condo boom. Tara Perkins talks to five developers who are betting - big - on a taller, denser future for Yonge and Eg
Looking out the window of his office in the Yonge Eglinton Centre, Ed Sonshine sees a lot of construction going on.
"This is a happening place," says the 66-year-old chief executive of RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust.
In many ways, it's the perfect vantage point for the future of big development in Toronto. Yonge and Eglinton is seeing a surge of office and condo construction.
The number of active new condo units in North Toronto rose 166 per cent in the last three years, significantly outpacing the growth rate of the western part of downtown, where cranes are ubiquitous.
A big part of the appeal? "Transportation," Mr. Sonshine says. When RioCan bought the Yonge Eglinton Centre six years ago, Mr. Sonshine became so convinced that the area was set for a resurgence that he moved the company's own offices into the building, from their previous location in a King Street tower in the financial district.
"We didn't know for sure about the Eglinton transit route, but they've been talking about it for 100 years, so I figured sooner or later it was going to happen," he says.
And he was right. The province has since committed $8.4-billion to the creation of four light rail transit lines, including the Eglinton Crosstown LRT, which will run from Black Creek Drive to Kennedy Station and is scheduled to be complete by 2020. Yonge and Eglinton, which not so long ago was facing decline, is experiencing a massive growth spurt that is just in its infancy. Following in the footsteps of its southern siblings, it is going to get much taller, as 30-storey-plus condo buildings become more commonplace. And while density is being encouraged, the congestion that it can cause is likely to stir up more controversy around Yonge and Eg (or as Mr. Sonshine notes it's sometimes called, Young and Eligible) than it has in some parts of the core that are more accustomed to hustle and bustle.
But this is a train that's already out of the station. The average price per square foot for new condos in North Toronto has risen 18 per cent in the last three years, to $636, according to data from RealNet Canada Inc. While there are more cranes and higher prices on downtown's west side, its growth rate doesn't touch that at Yonge and Eg.
A cycle is occurring: Yonge and Eg became more attractive to residents, which attracted condo developers, who - with the added amenity of the new LRT line - are attracting more residents.
As the growth feeds on itself, new office space is being built for companies that want to tap into the growing pool of nearby residents. And condo builders are looking for ways to appeal to the area's vast population of renters.
The impact of these changes will be substantial, say developers who are becoming increasingly active in the area. Five of them gathered recently at Grano, a restaurant on Yonge Street that's a local mainstay. Over coffees and cakes, they discussed the neighbourhood's transformation and why they are collectively betting billions of dollars on the area.
"We feel that this is the beginning for Yonge and Eglinton," says Todd Cowan, a partner at CD Capital, which has teamed up with Freed Developments for a big condo development push there.
"Yonge and Eglinton needed something to give it a kickstart, and we think that this commitment for the LRT line is what really created the impetus," Mr. Cowan says.
CD Capital and Freed Developments will be making a billion-dollar commitment to the neighbourhood over the next five to ten years. "We're big believers that, if you look back ten years from now, it's going to be one of those moments where if you're not in, you're going to say 'Geez, I wish I had invested there,' " Mr. Cowan says.
Chris Sherriff-Scott, senior vice-president at Minto, remembers when the area was losing its mojo during the '90s. "It was actually in decline," he says. "When do people know that a neighbourhood is in decline? When they wake up one day and stores are shuttered. That's what was happening here gradually."
"It was a sleeper for a very long time, but it was stable," says Maurice Wager of Shiplake Management Company, which has been active in the neighbourhood for decades.
The developers suggested that density is inevitable, and should be welcomed as a sign of a neighbourhood on the rise. "The fact is that the opportunities for newly built housing in this area, and in most parts of the 416, are a higher form of density," says Jim Ritchie, a senior vice-president at Tridel.
"We traditionally produce 25,000 homes in the Greater Toronto Area, and it used to be 17,000 or 18,000 of those were low-rise," says Jared Menkes, a development manager at Menkes. "Now it's switching to 17,000 to 18,000 high-rise, and 12,000 or 13,000 low-rise homes. And that low-rise number is still coming down because we're finding it harder and harder every day to find land to build those."
In addition to attracting new residents to the neighbourhood, the condo developers who are pushing into Yonge and Eg are hoping to coax some of the renters in the many apartment buildings that have long dominated the area into buying units. "This community has the highest percentage of renters in the city," says Mr. Ritchie.
Of condo buyers, about one-third are single females, a much higher proportion than average, he adds. "And you also have a very high percentage ... of the people in this community who are either single or couples that don't have kids."
Investors are also snapping up many of the new condo units. And that's pushing apartment landlords to improve their offerings, even though the rental market is tight right now. Mr. Wager says that Shiplake's 1965 apartment building at 45 Dunfield Ave. is turning over units in two to three days when they become vacant. Nonetheless, "now we're starting to test the market by introducing what we feel is a suite that's more competitive with the newer stock," he adds. The company will keep apartments off the market for about a month after they're vacated and do extensive upgrades.
"A typical one-bedroom that would go for $1,450 a month is now going for $1,650 or $1,700 a month. We're starting to hit those condo rents in apartment buildings," Mr. Wager says.
The province legislates maximum rent increases for existing apartment tenants, one of the reasons why relatively few apartment buildings are being constructed. So it's somewhat surprising when Mr. Wager says that the momentum at Yonge and Eg is strong enough that "we're looking at doing new purpose-built rental buildings in the area."
The neighbourhood's offices are undergoing a revitalization in step with the housing stock, says Mr. Menkes. He points to firms like LinkedIn and Facebook, which have offices in the area. With a growing base of eager young workers moving in, many companies are taking notice. "The condominium buildings that we bring in are bringing in the workforce," says Mr. Ritchie.
Back at his office in the Yonge and Eglinton Centre, Mr. Sonshine is thinking of adding 250,000 square feet ofoffice space on top of the existing towers. "When we bought this building the office [space] was only about 80 per cent occupied. Today it's 100 per cent," he says. Four or five years ago, the company studied the idea of building more offices, but the costs of construction weren't economical. Now, rents are increasing and tenants are hungry for more space.
This, the developers say, is the new reality here. "There are a number of projects that are high-profile - they look large unto themselves," says Mr. Sherriff-Scott. "But if you look at them in terms of the community as a whole, there wasn't anything happening here for close to 25 years. Its time has come."

Full text:   Former businessman donated collection of African treasures to the Art Gallery of Ontario
Back in the late 1950s, when Murray Frum, the son of Polish immigrants, was a young dentist, he went to New York with his wife, Barbara. After touring the galleries of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the couple dropped into the gift shop, where Murray spotted a remarkably good collection of reproduction Egyptian sculptures. "Oh, they aren't copies," the sales clerk confided, "they are extras from the museum collection." She then showed the Frums a basement storeroom crammed with stone and wood sculptures, some of which were 4,000 years old, as Mr. Frum relates in his privately published memoir, Collecting: A Work in Progress.
The piece that had captivated him was a wood figure, slightly less than a foot tall, dating from the Middle Kingdom. The sculpture, which had "a beautiful posture and an exquisite face," had been found during a Met expedition to Egypt and had even been illustrated in one of the museum's publications. That the piece was for sale in the very museum that had discovered it was a shocking indication of how lowly the Met valued African art, a point underlined by the bargain-basement price tag: $75.
It was irresistible, but Mr. Frum didn't have enough cash, so he left the museum, borrowed the money from the local branch of his university fraternity and made "the first purchase of what was to become a collection and a life-long focus."
That wooden sculpture is now part of the Frum collection in the Art Gallery of Ontario in a purpose-built gallery designed by the architectural team of Brigitte Shim and Howard Sutcliffe. Mr. Frum was an active AGO trustee and donor, but that's not the primary reason he gave the gallery his beloved African treasures, according to Ms. Shim. "He could easily have given the collection to the Royal Ontario Museum, but it is not about an anthropological condition or social patterns. He considered it beautiful art," she said.
A casual observer might dismiss Mr. Frum, who made a fortune developing suburban strip shopping malls, as a collector with a keen eye and enough money to buy whatever he wanted, but simply acquiring stuff didn't interest him.
"Before making an acquisition, Murray would come home to his library and he would pull out his books and catalogues and look at other examples of similar pieces and work at determining if a piece was good or bad and how it would fit into the collection," his widow, Nancy Lockhart, said in an interview. "He was a very passionate collector, but a very disciplined one as well."
"There are very, very few people I can think of who had a finer sense of taste," said Matthew Teitelbaum, director and CEO of the AGO. "All you had to do was walk into his house and see how he lived with his objects to know that he was very engaged by how they looked, their presence and how they felt." Speaking of Mr. Frum's love of the tactile reminded Mr. Teitelbaum that he had first met Mr. Frum as a child of 8, sitting in the dentist's chair. "He had the most beautiful hands, very controlled," he recalled.
"I think there was something empathetic" between Mr. Frum's work as a dentist and his love of the handmade in art, Mr. Teitelbaum said.
As a result of Mr. Frum's sleuthing, he bought a Baroque bronze figure of a crucified Jesus, covered in black paint, several years ago. Dismissed as a 19th-century piece produced by an unnamed artist from the Italian School, the sculpture has since been authenticated as the work of the renowned 17th-century Italian artist and architect Gian Lorenzo Bernini. It also hangs in the AGO.
Besides his business acumen and passion for collecting, Mr. Frum gave back to the cultural community. He was a calming and strategic president of the board of Saturday Night Magazine during its bankruptcy in the 1970s and of the Stratford Festival in the turbulent late 1980s when artistic directors were rotating through the theatre company like ticketholders in a turnstile, and a knowledgable, generous, strategic and long-time trustee of the AGO.
All his life he kept acquiring new friends, while retaining old ones, in an ever-expanding social circle. He also had two extremely happy marriages, first to Barbara Frum, the host of CBC shows As It Happens and The Journal , and then to Ms. Lockhart, a business executive.
Asked what made Mr. Frum such a good husband, Ms. Lockhart replied: "He was curious about everything, easy to be with, had no traditional expectations about housewifely duties, and enormous respect for women - perhaps that was his biggest characteristic in dealing with wives and women," she said. "And he was unbelievably generous."
Collecting art became their mutual passion. "It informed most of what we did in our lives. There wasn't a day where we weren't talking about pieces or looking at pieces and when we travelled, we were always going to museums and meeting other collectors and purchasing art."
Mr. Frum, 81, died of cancer on May 27 at his home in Toronto. All the interwoven strands of his life came together at his packed memorial service yesterday at the Royal Conservatory of Music. Writer David Frum said his father hated funerals, but this one seemed lovingly planned to evoke his presence. The service included a piano and cello duo, hauntingly beautiful singing by cantor Eric Moses, readings by children and grandchildren and eulogies that brought mourners to tears and laughter. A tenor and baritone sang Georges Bizet's amazing Pearl Fishers' Duet , and finally the cellist and pianist returned to play the American spiritual Old Man River as a recessional to keep people "rolling along" in a final reference to Mr. Frum's buoyant confidence.
Murray Bernard Frum was born in Toronto on Sept. 3, 1931, the only child of Saul and Rivka Frum, who had met and married in Lomza in northeast Poland before immigrating to Toronto in 1930. Most of their relatives who remained in Poland were murdered in the Holocaust.
Mr. Frum worked at a series of jobs in the tough years of the Depression before opening a small grocery store on College and Palmerston streets in 1938. The family lived in the back of the store with young Murray and his grandmother sleeping in the living room, she on a pullout bed and he on the couch, with cloth sacks of sugar under their heads for pillows.
He went to King Edward elementary school and then Harbord Collegiate, graduating in 1950. Already interested in the visual and performing arts - his father took him as a young man to hear the Canadian Opera Company sing at the Royal Alexandra Theatre - he audited art-history courses given by the late Ted Carpenter at the University of Toronto while he was studying to become a dentist.
By all accounts, Mr. Frum wasn't obsessed by drilling cavities and pulling teeth. A cousin, who was a doctor, had advised him against studying medicine because it would take a long time to qualify and as a profession it was all-consuming. Far better to become a dentist, the cousin advised, because he could make a good living and have spare time in which to exercise his already robust entrepreneurial muscles.
"He was very interested in starting life," David Frum explained in an interview. His father had always worked part-time to pay his way through school, including selling door to door for Fuller Brush, working at the Banff Springs Hotel and at a local bakery. An avid Monopoly player, he was already buying and selling small real-estate parcels with a group of friends in university, and from the time in graduated in 1956 and opened his dentistry practice, he was spending one day a week as a property developer, and pursuing his curiosity and passion as an art collector.
Describing his father as an unusual businessman, David Frum said he could be tough, but he was more interested in making sure everybody walked away from a deal content, if not happy. "Never reach for the last nickel on the table" was his business rule of thumb.
In September, 1957, Mr. Frum married Barbara Rosberg, a history student and the daughter of a Polish emigré who owned a department store in Niagara Falls. The Frums had three children, David, Linda and Matthew. While she worked in broadcasting and he in property development - by 1972, he had given up dentistry - they both developed a passion for studying and collecting art, pre-Columbian Mexican, and then African. (With Ms. Lockhart, he expanded those interests to include Oceanic and Renaissance art.)
Wanting a house, and finding nothing they liked and could afford in the late 1950s, the Frums bought a large property in North Toronto and hired a young architect named Yusing Jung - they all lived in the same apartment building - to design a modern house that could be expanded, as needs demanded and budgets allowed. The house evolved over the decades under Ron Thom, who designed Massey College in Toronto and Trent University in Peterborough, and much more extensively in the last three decades in conjunction with the architectural duo, Brigitte Shim and Howard Sutcliffe, a former assistant to Mr. Thom.
"Murray loved every piece of art in his house and every time you would go, something would be in a different place," said Ms. Shim. Ms. Lockhart agreed: "There isn't a thing in this house that isn't touched and handled all the time," she said. "He loved sculpture and space and one of the amazing things about his house is that there was never a master vision," said Ms. Shim.
The house grew episodically, but unlike Topsy, every change and addition was the consequence of an evolving conversation between the architects and the Frums. The result is an eclectic living museum that is smaller and more personal than the old Barnes house in Philadelphia, more focused than Kettle's Yard in Cambridge, and probably closest to the purposeful ambience of the Sir John Soane's Museum in London.
Mr. Frum's life also evolved. After Barbara Frum died of leukemia in 1992, he met Ms. Lockhart at a dinner party given by mutual friends. They eloped two years later, marrying in Palm Beach on her grandmother's birthday, Feb. 15, 1994.
Mr. Frum and Ms. Lockhart were both entrepreneurs - she had owned a large discount drug store before joining Shoppers Drug Mart as a vice-president - but they decided to work together at Frum Development Group, so they could have the flexibility and freedom to travel as and when they pleased.
"He was always the deal-maker," Ms. Lockhart said, explaining that she liked the administrative side, so she took over that role after Mr. Frum's vice-chairman retired. About a decade ago, they sold a number of properties and closed down the construction department. Since then they have invested in other people's construction projects.
In April, the Frums were in Italy because they had acquired a wooden bas-relief of a mother and child that they wanted to compare to a couple of Donatellos in an exhibition in Florence. The trip had to be curtailed when Mr. Frum developed a severe pain in his left leg, which they thought might have been caused by a pinched nerve or even a small stroke.
They flew back and went to Toronto Western Hospital in the same neighbourhood where Mr. Frum had grown up. After a series of tests, he was diagnosed with metastasized lung cancer, although he had never smoked. Ever the optimist, he was undergoing radiation and preparing for chemotherapy last month when he suddenly became very ill and had to be hospitalized. On Monday morning, May 27, he woke up in his own bed and said "music." Ms. Lockhart found some Cecilia Bartoli arias, which they listened to for most of the day, as she lay beside him in bed, the dog curled up against his legs and his daughter Linda sitting at his feet. He died at about 6:30 that evening.
"As far as bad things go," said Ms. Lockhart, "it was the best possible outcome - no pain, a view of the garden, surrounded by the things he loved and in the environment he loved."
Mr. Frum leaves his wife Nancy, three children, several grandchildren and his extended family.

Full text:   First-time developer Bill Gairdner opens with a Roncesvalles mid-rise that nods politely to neighbouring architecture
jmays@globeandmail.com
As long-time readers of this column know, I talk often with Peter Clewes. I do so because, in my line of work, it's inevitable.
Of the local designers who have ridden the wave of Toronto's inner-city condominium boom, none has been more prolific.
His buildings have dotted (or are on track to dot) streetscapes all over downtown. If he never crafted another structure, his distinctive brand of pragmatic modernism would already have given this era in Hogtown's real estate history several of its most memorable architectural expressions.
As it happens, of course, Mr. Clewes isn't stopping at all, and one of his office's recent proposals was the prompt for the conversation I had with him last week.
The topic was a multi-storey residential block slated to go up on an old industrial site at 383 Sorauren Ave., on the edge of the comfortable, attractively eclectic Roncesvalles neighbourhood. For the record, it's the first project by developer Bill Gairdner, who was, before going independent, a vice-president in Peter Freed's real estate group. Interior design is by Johnson Chou.
Also for the record: The stolid exterior treatment of the building is largely the handiwork of Heather Rolleston, Mr. Clewes's associate in his firm, architectsAlliance. But the result of this in-house collaboration embodies characteristic themes in Mr. Clewes's recent thinking about architecture, hence in the artistic culture of the office.
Not so long ago, for instance, architectsAlliance sought to make its buildings look and behave as differently as possible from the brick and stone fabric of Victorian Toronto. The Sorauren Avenue proposal, in contrast, nods politely to the elderly warehouses in its vicinity, picking up on their plain, working-class geometry and their robust brick facades, and generally striking a modest, amenable pose.
(It may not be modest enough for the planners at city hall. Mr. Gairdner said they were withholding permission until the architects notch back the uppermost storeys of the front façade. I hope the developer and architectsAlliance win this fight. The suggested move, in my view, would weaken the building's firm, resolved presence on the streetscape, which is the most interesting thing about it.)
Old-fashioned Toronto brickwork has been an important source of inspiration for Mr. Clewes and Ms. Rolleston. The glass terrace fronts are fritted to suggest patterns of laid brick. The recessed glass walls of the suites are framed by bold brick strips and angled brick planes. This block is certainly modern, but it's no modernist glass box.
When I mentioned that I found the solidity and opacity of the building appealing, Mr. Clewes replied firmly that its surface is still to be "about 65 per cent" glass.
In other words, he drew attention to the structure's transparency. That's an unfashionable move for an architect to make nowadays. It's much more stylish to damn glass walls as inefficient and cheap and liable to fall apart, and to hail the revival of more substantial facades as a return to sanity.
Numerous voices, popular and professional, have been recently raised in the anti-glass chorus. CBC Toronto's Metro Morning website, for example, advises us that "building scientists have known for a long time that glass-walled structures are less energy efficient than the stone and concrete buildings that were put up 40 or 50 years ago. ... [I]ndustry insiders warn that as energy costs climb, glass towers may become the 'pariah' buildings of the future."
The same series of articles and broadcasts (first aired in 2011, and now available online) cites important researchers who have weighed in against glass, including Ted Kesik, an engineer and professor of building science at the University of Toronto.
Not so fast! Mr. Clewes and Ms. Rolleston told me. If properly designed, manufactured and installed, a glass wall can perform as well as, and even better than, a traditional solid wall system.
But those are sizable "ifs" - and nobody, as far as I can tell, is saying the usual condo suite launched in Toronto during the last 20 years has been outfitted according to the highest standards.
The complaints about glass walls catalogued in the CBC broadcasts, in other media and in the scholarly writings of Ted Kesik and other experts appear to be grounded in fact.
I wish the reality were otherwise, since I like the shine, lift and futurism of glass towers - including the beautiful ones that architectsAlliance has brought to Toronto. Unless developers become able and willing to make better glass buildings, however, the towers of the energy-conscious future may well look more solid than they have in recent years.

The Action: This custom brick and stone residence immediately caught the attention of two local homeowners who had spent three years casually searching the west-end neighbourhood for a new home with a double garage and lower level in-law suite. They had no hesitation in making an offer for the full asking price of $1.45-million.
What They Got: About two years ago, a builder redeveloped a 49-by-150-foot lot for personal use, so this four-bedroom and five-bathroom house offers 5,800-square-feet of lavish living space, including the basement.
* There are 10-foot ceilings above the study, a formal dining area, a fireside family room and an eat-in kitchen constructed with limestone floors, floor-to-ceiling cabinetry, a granite-topped island and double doors to the stone patio and fenced yard.
* Hardwood floors and pot lights appear virtually throughout, from the lower-level bedroom, recreation and family rooms to a master suite upstairs with a walk-in closet, Juliet balcony and private ensuite.
The Agent's Take: "It had gorgeous curb appeal and everything was done with top of the line materials and workmanship," agent Terry Mantzukis said. "It had a certain wow factor."
This meant, no area was overlooked. "It had a gorgeous kitchen well laid out ... it had a very nicely finished basement and all the bathrooms were quite stunning," Mr. Mantzukis added. "Some of the other things that made it stand out was the custom millwork put into it, like decorative archways."

Abstract: The measures "are absolutely ridiculous," said Kevin O'Connor managing director of Cranbrook Basements a London-based company that employs about 200 people in basement construction. Mr. O'Connor said the council is overreacting to complaints from a few people who simply don't like change.

Full text:   When Canadian businessman David Graham decided to expand his house in a high-end London neighbourhood, he didn't want to build up or out. He planned to dig down. Way down.
Mr. Graham, a former cable television mogul who was once married to Barbara Amiel Black, drew up plans to carve out three storeys below his 19th-century home in Knightsbridge.
The extra space was for a swimming pool, a three-car garage, a gym, a ballroom, changing rooms, a hot tub and servants' quarters.
He joined the growing number of wealthy Londoners - including Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich and steel tycoon Lakshmi Mittal - who have been turning their mansions into so called "iceberg homes," named because most of the house is below ground.
But only now are the Byzantine London real-estate regulations catching up to the trend as neighbours grow increasingly irate.
Residents are pushing the epicentre of these excavations, the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, to block all basement expansions.
The district is now in a difficult position.
Like every local council in Britain, it has strict building regulations for above-ground construction but almost nothing governing basements.
"Nobody on councils ever thought that anybody would want to go three or four floors down," said Roarie Scarisbrick of PropertyVision, a London company that provides advice to home buyers. "The councils and the boroughs who are most affected are scrambling around trying to get sensible guidelines in place because they are being left behind on this."
Other boroughs are waiting to see if Kensington and Chelsea succeed at the national level with their guidelines. If they do, Westminster, Hammersmith and Fulham will follow suit.
Driven by soaring house prices and tight regulations on above-ground construction, the super-rich here have taken to spending millions of dollars digging deep to increase their square footage and boost property values. And these subterranean enclaves have become more and more elaborate - housing tennis courts, bowling alleys, theatres and even a car museum.
Last year, Kensington and Chelsea, where the average house price is the equivalent of about $2.5-million, had 307 applications for basement developments. That compared to 187 in 2011 and barely a handful years earlier. And the projects keep getting more controversial. Christoph Stanger, a managing director at Goldman Sachs, caused a furor last year when the basement dig at his $10-million Kensington house caused nearby homes to sink so much, door frames shifted and neighbours couldn't get out. Then there was Jon Hunt, founder of a real-estate agency called Foxtons, who proposed going down 22 metres and building a tennis court, pool, gym and enough space for his collection of vintage Ferraris.
"I want them to stop doing basements altogether," long-time Chelsea resident Gabrielle Teare said in a recent interview. Two of her neighbours have dug down multiple storeys, leaving her with numerous cracked walls and roughly $50,000 in damages. One neighbour offered to pay about $4,000 toward her repair bills and indicated that if she wanted any more she'd have to sue. At least 12 other homes in the area have been damaged, she added, and there are real fears houses will be begin to sink.
"I think it's just appalling," said Ms. Teare, who runs an image-consulting firm in London. "It's very offensive to live next door to someone who is building a basement."
The borough is beginning to respond, and Mr. Graham's house appears to have been the last straw. In December, it turned down his basement application after receiving a flood of protests from his neighbours, including novelist Edna O'Brien. Mr. Graham argued to the council that he needed the extra space because he couldn't find a larger home in the area, but the borough decided in part that the structure would be too unstable.
It is now proposing to limit basement constructions to a single storey and prohibit basements under historic properties and gardens. Other boroughs are considering similar measures but most are waiting to see whether Kensington and Chelsea's changes will take effect. And that's far from certain.
The proposals must still be approved by a national body called the Planning Inspectorate and builders are gearing up for a fight.
The measures "are absolutely ridiculous," said Kevin O'Connor managing director of Cranbrook Basements a London-based company that employs about 200 people in basement construction. Mr. O'Connor said the council is overreacting to complaints from a few people who simply don't like change. And he said there is no evidence that larger basements are a hazard to other properties. "Basements aren't dangerous but they do cause people to phone up and complain [to local councillors]. It's utterly ridiculous that this is the basis of these proposals," he said. He added that the basement industry employs thousands of workers and those jobs could be put at risk.
Some residents agree. In comments posted on a borough website, Preety and David Hudd, who have lived in Chelsea for 30 years, said the proposals infringe on homeowners' rights and will cost the council revenue.
But many others agree with the proposed changes and have urged the council not to back down. In a lengthy submission to council, Chelsea resident Alicia di Sirignano wrote about the chaos these projects cause. The rush to build ever-larger underground homes is more than an inconvenience, she argued, "it is a relentless pace that invades the human psyche and the human soul that we human beings cannot live with at constantly sustained levels. ... We seem to have lost social conscience within the community of 'civilized society' and destructive materialism has reached an almost pathological state."

Eric Peterson is wound up and ready to pitch. With his laptop flipped open so he can reference details, the man who might be described as British Columbia's biggest unknown philanthropist starts talking about his current passion - and doesn't stop for an hour.
Mr. Peterson, a former research scientist at Harvard who made a fortune building and selling a medical imaging company, isn't excited about an investment - but an idea.
It's an idea about the importance of science, particularly environmental science, into which he has quietly sunk about $70-million, founding and operating the Hakai Beach Institute, on B.C.'s Central Coast.
Mr. Peterson, together with his wife, Christina Munck, run the largely unknown institute on remote Calvert Island, about 60 kilometres south of Bella Bella, where they fund an extensive archeological program and long-term studies of marine and terrestrial ecology.
In 2002, after selling his Ontario-based company, Mitra Imaging Inc., he and Ms. Munck moved back to B.C. and set up the Tula Foundation, which spends about $2-million a year supporting health-care initiatives in Guatemala. Tula, which exclusively funds the Hakai Institute, also has given $7-million to establish the Centre for Microbial Diversity at the University of B.C., and $2.75-million to the University of Victoria's Environmental Law Centre.
The institute operates on a site that once was a wilderness retreat and fishing lodge for the very rich.
"I used to hate that place," said Mr. Peterson, who was born in Port Alberni and who has long travelled up and down the B.C. coast.
Located on a sheltered inlet near some of the most beautiful beaches on the West Coast, Hakai was for many years not a welcoming port of call.
"It was like a gated community. It was unfriendly. Kevin Costner came to visit. Rupert Murdoch came to visit ... but local people were told to keep out. It was private and exclusive," he said.
The Hakai luxury retreat went out of business, however, reopening as a fishing lodge, which also eventually failed.
That's when Mr. Peterson and Ms. Munck saw an opportunity to open a research institute and centralize some of the ecological science programs they had been funding at universities.
"I was looking for a property to serve as a base, so we could get our coastal [research] projects working together. We were looking for an old fishing lodge or something," he said, "and I realized Hakai was just about to go on the market, at a time of the real estate collapse."
His entrepreneurial instincts told him to pounce - and two weeks later he owned the resort and 215 acres of land, all of which was surrounded by an extensive park conservancy.
The lodge, which has been updated with state-of-the-art power, water and sewage treatment plants, can house up to 100 people at a time. It is busy from March to November, usually with 50 to 75 staff, guests and visiting scientists.
Mr. Peterson said one of the first things he did after moving in was to mend fences - not physical ones, but the relationships with two local First Nations whose territories overlapped on Calvert Island and who could trace their presence in the area back 12,000 years.
They hadn't felt welcome at the luxury resort either. Mr. Peterson has invited them back, involving them in research projects, including a major initiative that is looking at the archeological record of ancient village sites.
He also had to patch up relations with BC Parks, which had been in a running battle with a succession of former owners over access to the adjacent Hakai Luxvbalis Conservancy area.
Mr. Peterson said in the "gated community" days, Hakai restricted access to the only dock in the area, which meant the public couldn't get to the famous white sand beaches in the conservancy.
Now there are welcome signs up and Mr. Peterson says he exchanges e-mails with BC Parks daily.
"We are the de facto park HQ," he said.
Mr. Peterson to this point has not sought financial support from government, academic institutions or the private sector.
"So far we've been lazy and haven't asked [anyone] to contribute," said Mr. Peterson. "But we can't complain because we haven't done anything to raise our visibility."
He says he's going to do a better job of that - and that's why he has finally started talking about it.

Abstract: A Toronto brokerage whose agents charge sellers a 1.5-per-cent commission, which the agency boasts is "a savings of at least $5,000 on a $500,000 house." Realosophy recommends sellers pay the buyer's agent 2.5 per cent, because otherwise fewer agents might bring clients to see the house. "In urban centres, this is a generation that uses things like wedding planners," Realosophy's John Pasalis said. "At the end of the day, people still need help."

Full text:   REAL ESTATE REPORTER
The power of the Internet was going to shatter the grip that realtors have on house sales in Canada, driving down commissions and empowering consumers.
The Internet failed.
The Competition Bureau waded in to overcome the industry's stasis, attempting to create a market where consumers pick which services they want and data are more widely available.
But, so far, it's accomplished little.
In a country where grousing about bank fees is a national pastime, where a 5-cent rise in gasoline prices sparks outrage, one fee remains remarkably static: the thousands in commissions paid to real estate brokers. Technology has failed to snap consumers out of their complacency, and regulatory efforts to force the industry to make it easier for new Web-based firms to compete have been abortive.
But there is a new threat to the status quo that could be the catalyst for industry-rattling change: the housing slowdown.
Canadian house prices were generally on a tear from the turn of the century until last year, with most sellers still netting a tidy profit even after paying commissions. But that growth has now begun to taper off, with year-over-year price increases slowing from more than 6 per cent at the outset of last year to less than 3 per cent at the outset of this year (and some markets, such as Vancouver, seeing outright declines).
Economists suggest that the market could be entering a lengthy period in which house prices remain essentially flat. Toronto-Dominion Bank's economists recently estimated that the nominal annual rate of return on real estate will be about 2 per cent over the next decade. In other words, the rise in home prices will just keep pace with inflation.
And that means that homeowners who buy and sell homes in the next 10 years will not be making the profits that homeowners who bought and sold in the past decade got used to. More commonly, sellers will be accepting prices that are much closer to what they paid.
John Andrew, a professor at Queen's University, suggests the following analogy: When the stock market is rising and you're making money, then you don't mind paying a broker a fee, but if you lose money on your investment, then the charges will be upsetting.
The market dynamics are changing at a time when new real estate startups, which are largely Internet based, are becoming more innovative. "There is no question that commissions are very high, and there is a big consumer pushback against that," Mr. Andrew says. "It doesn't make sense to me that it be a fixed per cent, and perhaps it's time to begin to look at more of a sliding scale like we have for the land transfer tax, like we have for the income tax."
Realtors' commissions are negotiable, and industry sources say the current average commission in the Greater Toronto Area, as an example, is between 4 and 5 per cent. Commissions tend to be higher in rural areas than in major cities, and in many parts of Canada they are often lower. In Western Canada, sellers often pay a two-tiered rate that is closer to what Mr. Andrew would like to see, such as 7 per cent on the first $100,000 of sales value, and 1.5 per cent on the balance.
Over the course of the past 12 years, a period in which house prices rose at an astonishing clip, the average resale price of a house in Toronto roughly doubled, while commissions remained around 5 per cent (that commission gets split between the buyer's agent and the seller's agent). That means the average total commission rose from about $12,160 in the year 2000 to $24,950 last year. Price increases have been steeper in some other parts of the country. If you take 5 per cent as a basic commission, Calgary saw commissions on an average sale rise to $20,620 from about $8,820 during the same period and Vancouver saw them increase to $36,500 from $14,800.
Change comes slowly
The stakes are high. Real estate agents took in an estimated $8.26-billion in commissions across the country last year (based on a 5-per-cent rate), up from $3.96-billion 10 years ago, reflecting both an increase in the value of home prices and the number of sales.
"Real estate agents used to have to sell quite a few houses to make a living, and in cities where the prices are really high, they don't any more," Mr. Andrew says.
But he and others are quick to point out that the life of a realtor is not a life of leisure. A lot of work goes on behind the scenes, and since the number of homes changing hands in most areas of the country has shrunk significantly since last summer, agents have had to work harder in recent months to keep business up.
Canada lacks data on the exact amount of commissions that are paid to realtors each year.
"There are no set commissions," says Gary Simonsen, the chief executive officer of the Canadian Real Estate Association, which represents about 100 real estate boards and associations. "They are purely negotiable between buyer and seller and the agent involved, and it's not something that we track nor do our boards and associations."
Canada also lacks data on how many consumers buy or sell a house without a realtor.
Mr. Simonsen says the number of transactions that are occurring over the MLS has remained remarkably constant over the past decade. "I think people will certainly try various and sundry things depending upon their own personal circumstances, but at the end of the day we still see that people are relying upon a realtor ultimately to assist them in the transaction, whether it's on the buying or the selling side."
Amid the market turmoil, CREA launched a new TV ad campaign this spring. Its amusing commercials are based on the theme of Internet overconfidence. One spot shows scenarios such as a man searching "how to be your own lawyer" online and winding up strip-searched by police; a guy checking relationship advice on his smartphone only to find his date storming out of dinner, smashing the dishes on the restaurant table and popping her middle finger on the way; and a cheat sheet on edible mushrooms followed by footage of a naked man laughing like a lunatic and spinning around the woods. Cue the announcer: "Why do we think if we can look it up we can do it? When it comes to your home, get help, get a realtor."
Home sales have been in a slump since last summer, creating a situation where a realtor's help is generally more valuable to sellers. But economists expect the declines to dissipate and give way to a period of more stable, but moderate, sales. "The market has to swing a bit more in favour of the seller, and sales have to pick up, for these alternatives to really have the opportunity to compete," Mr. Andrew says. The companies that cater to do-it-yourselfers argue that sellers without a realtor have an advantage in this market, because they can afford to reduce their asking price by the amount of commission they stand to save.
The Competition Bureau recently noted that, at least when it comes to Toronto, the top five agencies have cornered the market, taking in more than 70 per cent of commissions in recent years. Re/Max and Royal LePage combined are responsible for more than 40 per cent of commissions.
Walter Melanson, director of partnerships at PropertyGuys.com, is hoping that the market dynamics will loosen the grip that the big brokerages have on the market. "We anticipate that an increasing number of sellers will abandon the high cost of using a traditional agent because they won't want to give up what little equity they do have," he says. But he's been wrong before.
PropertyGuys.com has been up and running since the dot-com era was in its heyday. The company sells advertising services to people who want to sell their home without a realtor, and is rolling out a new product it calls "Pro Approach" where online experts, real estate lawyers, appraisers and others are made available for a cost that Mr. Melanson says still amounts to a small fraction of a realtor.
Not long after starting out, PropertyGuys.com had thousands of customers a year. But in the early days those customers couldn't get their houses onto the all-important Multiple Listing Service and the industry's realtor.ca website without paying to use a realtor's full services. That changed in 2010 as a result of prodding by the Competition Bureau. The Canadian Real Estate Association, which represents realtors from coast to coast and owns MLS and realtor.ca, agreed to change the rules so that brokers could post a listing on those sites for a flat fee.
It was supposed to be a game changer. Sellers could get their listings on the most important website in Canadian real estate for a relatively small amount. Overnight, PropertyGuys.com saw the number of customers it was dealing with rise from between 7,000 and 8,000 a year to about 10,000, Mr. Melanson says. But growth stalled at that level.
"The market is right where the bureau left it, it's in the same state almost that it was then," he says with a sigh, calling the failure of technology to upend the industry "the non-existent revolution."
Fighting against lower fees
One of the highest hurdles new entrants say they have to clear is access to data that are controlled by the realtors' association. While it's possible to sell a home through MLS without an agent, it's still largely impossible for those outside the system to access the vast trove of market intelligence and sales figures assembled by local real estate boards.
That makes competing real estate services and websites less attractive to people selling their homes.
"The Canadian Real Estate Association controls the listings, controls the MLS, nationally, and as a result nobody else has been able to make inroads into the buying-and-selling-property business with online tools and apps," says Peter Zollman, founding principal of Aimgroup.com, a consultancy based near Orlando, Fla., that publishes a report on real estate websites around the world. "In our view, Canada is still very much an outlier, because there is so little competition among real estate sites."
The Competition Bureau recently lost, and is now appealing, a case in which it was seeking to make data about the prices that have been paid for homes more accessible online. That case, against the Toronto Real Estate Board, which represents more than 35,000 agents, was seen as a test case for the whole country.
"As a practitioner with an interest in the field, I can say that the...decision bears close scrutiny and it raises important issues about the interplay between the statutory prohibitions in the [Competition] Act and conduct by those few firms in Canada that are truly dominant in their market," says Melanie Aitken, who stepped down as Competition Bureau commissioner last fall.
PropertyGuys' Mr. Melanson argues that the dominant players are resisting change with all their might. "There are 100,000 real estate agents in this country that don't want fees to drop," he says. "We're going to have to fight for every inch."
Stories abound of consumers who have tried to sell their home on their own and thrown in the towel, but there is also a growing number of satisfied do-it-yourselfers.
Deryck Hatheway paid PropertyGuys $798 plus tax for their full-service package to sell his house in Bathurst, N.B., recently, as he sold his optometry practice there to move to Fredericton. He also paid $299 to have his house listed on the MLS, $39 for photos and $20 for an additional ad in the paper.
His house sold in December, two months after he listed it, for $146,000, a bit less than his asking price, and saved thousands of dollars by putting the extra effort in himself.
"We have a zinc mine that's closing down, so it's not booming real estate," Mr. Hatheway says.
"So I found two months to be pretty good for Bathurst. And, having done that, I'd never go through a real estate agent again."
Anecdotally, it's believed that about 20 per cent of sellers in Quebec and 10 per cent in the rest of the country don't use a realtor, says Phil Soper, CEO of Royal LePage and Brookfield Real Estate Services.
There's no evidence that the sales-by-owner model and lower-commission alternatives are making significant headway; there is no evidence they aren't. No one's certain.
But Mr. Soper's not worried. The threat from technology? He points to other technological revolutions that haven't panned out: "Grocery Gateway, we were going to have intelligent fridges..." The Competition Bureau's efforts? "I'd say in the aftermath of it all, nothing's changed," he says.
He adds that most of the new ventures aren't turning much, if any, profit. Part of the reason is that real estate services have low profit margins, he says. In order to cut commissions, you need high volumes.
"While we've looked at it, and while there has been a lot of interest at the low end for four or five years now, I don't see anybody making money," he says. "The full-service brokerage remains the most preferred model in the country, or at least the model with the highest level of satisfaction. We're not investing in the alternative brokerage model any time soon."
While the proportion of people who want to use alternative models has remained the same, the number of companies catering to them has risen, says Gurinder Sandhu, executive vice-president at Re/Max Ontario-Atlantic.
"So there's less and less to go around for each one of those players."
Will the stagnation of house price growth be the catalyst that ultimately changes that? With the new players raising their game and the Competition Bureau not backing down, Queen's University professor Mr. Andrew, for one, believes that the commission revolution is still likely to occur.
"I think the full-service real estate agent who is charging full commission and providing the full host of services is probably going to become few and far between."

AGENTS OF CHANGE
In addition to companies such as Propertyguys, Comfree and Quebec-based DuProprio, which cater to people who want to sell without a real estate agent, firms have been popping up with a variety of business models. Here's a sampling:
Realosophy
A Toronto brokerage whose agents charge sellers a 1.5-per-cent commission, which the agency boasts is "a savings of at least $5,000 on a $500,000 house." Realosophy recommends sellers pay the buyer's agent 2.5 per cent, because otherwise fewer agents might bring clients to see the house. "In urban centres, this is a generation that uses things like wedding planners," Realosophy's John Pasalis said. "At the end of the day, people still need help."
Commission Pitch
A new startup focusing on southwestern Ontario that allows agents to compete for business in an auction-style process, which the company says can save thousands of dollars in commissions.
SundayBell.com
A Canadian online service that markets itself as being akin to an online dating service, matching consumers with real estate agents throughout North America.
TheRedPin.com
A Toronto-based service that employs real estate agents but it pays them differently. Rather than being commission-based, they are paid a salary plus a bonus that hinges on customer satisfaction as opposed to sales. TheRedPin.com still takes standard commissions from clients, but returns a portion in the form of rebates. It counts Onex Corp. founder Gerry Schwartz as a backer.
Zoocasa
An online service for buyers and sellers, owned by Rogers Communications, that has recently obtained a brokerage licence, primarily so it can access more data. It is in the midst of rolling out its newest services across Canada, works with agents from all of the major brokerages, such as Royal LePage, but it is pressuring commissions by offering consumers a rebate of roughly 15 per cent of their commission. "This industry as a whole has been determined to control the speed of progress and innovation, and has been successful in slowing innovation," said Lawrence Dale, group head of the real estate business at Zoocasa. "It's as if progress is only permitted if it does not upset the status quo and is available to everyone."

The benchmark price of a two-storey home in Calgary has fluctuated over the past five years, making it more difficult for sellers who bought at the outset of that period to turn a profit.
IN A LESS-EXPENSIVE MARKET
$100,000 Purchase price
$200,000 Sale price
$10,000 Five-per-cent commission
$90,000 Profit after commission
The benchmark price of a Regina condo has doubled in five years. For those lucky enough to have seen this kind of price appreciation, the commission is less of a burden.
IN AN EXPENSIVE MARKET
$1,500,000 Purchase price
$1,750,000 Sale price
$87,500 Five-per-cent commission
$162,500 Profit after commission
One of the arguments against the common form of commission is that it doesn't necessarily take three times as much work to sell a $1.5-million house as it does a $500,000 house.
Note: Realtors' commissions are negotiable. The current average in the Greater Toronto Area, for example, is between 4 per cent and 5 per cent. Commissions tend to be higher in rural areas than in major cities, and in many parts of Canada they are often lower. In Western Canada, sellers often pay a two-tiered commission. Other costs, such as legal fees and any applicable land transfer tax, are additional.

Full text:   Toronto architecture firm finds novel way to erect a populous condo development in Dhaka and stay out of nearby airport's airspace
jmays@globeandmail.com
When Toronto's JCI Architects Inc. was invited by a private Bangladeshi developer to design a middle-income condominium community in a northern suburb of Dhaka, the young firm was faced with a problem that is all too familiar to planners and other citizens who want to see greater density in the Greater Toronto Area.
It's this: How do you bring residential concentration to a site (such as this one near Dhaka) that lies directly underneath the approach path of an important international airport? (We've got Pearson; Dhaka has Hazrat Shahjalal, Bangladesh's largest and busiest air hub.) Are the areas around these facilities condemned to be forever carpeted by sprawl?
Of course, an ordinary skyscraper - the most obvious solution - is out of the question in such places.
But there's another way to tackle the issue.
Instead of pushing the tall buildings upright, you can tip the towers onto their sides, as JCI has decided to do in Bangladesh. This move lets skyscrapers do what they do best - provide dwellings that are safe and private, but compactly stacked in the landscape - while making them reach into the air no more than a few storeys.
The horizontal configuration of multiple living spaces is not new. Le Corbusier pioneered the form of the prone tall building when he did his hugely influential Unité d'Habitation residential block in Marseilles (1947-1952). And the designers of dwellings in Toronto's celebrated St. Lawrence Market neighbourhood put it to excellent use some 40 years ago. But JCI's Shobuj Pata complex (Bengali for "Green Leaf"), if built out according to the plans, could add an interesting page or two to the postwar history of this controversial housing type.
JCI's intriguing proposal has been devised by Jaegap Chung (principal in charge), project architect Derek McCallum and their colleague Sudipto Sengupta. The scheme's first phase features seven long, narrow, slightly curved structures, each 10 storeys tall and set down parallel to all the others. These buildings are meant to be differentiated by subtle variations of plantings on some facades and by the various kinds of trees placed in the park they stand in.
In terms of form, however, each block is very much like the ones beside it. The standard module contains four generously proportioned apartments per floor, each between 1,800 square feet and 2,000 square feet in area. Every suite is far longer than it is wide, a gesture intended to maximize the light coming in through the tall glass walls on the long sides. There are elevators for each 10-story stack of four-apartment clusters. Each of the seven long blocks comprises three of these modular stacks.
Put more simply: The total development is big - Mr. Chung estimates the population of the first phase alone could top 2,700 souls - but the architectural mass has been broken down into fine-grained, manageable bits with intimate entrances. Wholly absent, mercifully, are the long, impersonal double-loaded hallways we often find in condo slabs.
These suites are meant to be lived in by large families with servants, and, as far as I can tell, JCI's planning has been notably sensitive to the cultural needs and desires of white-collar Bangladeshis.
Though the divvying up of space in each apartment generally follows modernist open-plan precedents, for instance, the kitchen, in a nod to local tradition, is wholly enclosed. The climate is hot, people expect central air conditioning, so the architects have included it. (After an ecologically-minded fashion, that is: Mechanical cooling equipment is available for the warmest seasons, but it is supplemented by a simple system that pumps air deep into the earth, where the heat is taken out of it, then pumps it back to the surface and into the units.)
The designers have also made a point of encouraging more natural temperature management by leaving open a light and air shaft, about 15 feet wide and running the length of each block. This interval between the two wings of each building enables cross ventilation during the months when the mercury is not off the charts.
The setting of the blocks is park-like, though these are hardly "towers in the park." (The lawns and gardens are actually parts of the green roof of the vast one-level parking garage, situated below grade.) A long allee, cutting right through the buildings at grade and lined with shops, daycare centres, an elementary school, a fitness studio and other community facilities, bisects the site of Shobuj Pata's first phase, helping make it a livable, walkable place.
Even if this very large undertaking is not completed in Bangladesh - it may not be moving forward - JCI Architects has produced a thoughtful and imaginative package of plans that are applicable anywhere height is not desirable or not possible, and where density of human fabric is called for.

Full text:   Against all odds, the now-iconic brand celebrates its centenary
The English village of Aston Clinton is best known for a couple of local hills, one with a "magnetic force" that appears to draw cars up its slope, and another that exerts a very real automotive attraction.
A hundred years ago, its name was incorporated into what has become one of world's best recognized marque badges - Aston Martin.
Beside the roadway climbing Aston Hill, once on the estate of early motoring enthusiast Lord Rothschild, and used for hill climbs from 1904 until the mid-1920s, is a stone plinth bearing a plaque, erected by pilgrims from the Aston Martin Owners Club and Aston Martin Lagonda Limited.
It reads: "Lionel Martin made his first accent of this hill in a tuned Singer car on the 4th of April, 1914. Shortly afterwards, on the 16th of May, at the Herts County Automobile & Aero Club meeting, he was so successful that the sporting light car first registered in his name in March of 1915 was called an 'Aston-Martin'."
Martin, and partner Robert Bamford, had launched the Bamford & Martin Singer agency in London in 1913, and Martin drove a "tuned" 1.1-litre, flathead-engined Singer in rallies and hill climbs.
They then decided to create a car of their own, that would be more suitable for competition, and potential sale, but first built a "special" by dropping a 1.4-litre, Coventry-Simplex, four-cylinder engine into a 1908 Isotta Fraschini voiturette chassis.
It was this car, dubbed the "Coal Scuttle," that became the first "Aston-Martin." And ultimately, after a delay while the First World War was fought to its bloody conclusion, led to the creation of what would become one of the world's great, and despite all odds, still-surviving marques.
Bamford departed after the war, but Martin went on to develop the first of a series of prototypes. The first three were broken up, making the A3 of 1921 - purchased and restored by the Aston Martin Heritage Trust - the oldest surviving Aston Martin. It went into production a year later.
Aston Martin, now without the hyphen, had also made a return to competition, and a short-wheelbase version called "Bunny" set speed records at the Brooklands circuit. A pair of Grand Prix racers, one called "Green Pea," were then built for Polish Count Louis Zborowski, notorious for his "Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang" racers, one powered by an 18.8-litre Mercedes-Benz aero-engine.
By 1925, Martin had sunk a considerable amount of his fortune - the family quarried granite - into Aston Martin's racing and production cars, but managed to build only 50 or so. An injection of capital from Lady Dorothy Charnwood, which secured a place on the board for her son, kept the factory lights flickering, but bankruptcy soon followed.
The company was then restructured, attracting two more of what would become a lengthy list of enthusiastic, if not always farsighted, investors who drove the company from one fumbled fiscal gear-change to another - admittedly while generally enjoying themselves establishing its name as a motoring legend.
The first pair of investors were engineer William Somerville Renwick, who had a newly inherited family fortune at his disposal, and partner Augustus Cesare Bertelli, a successful racer and noted designer, who was Italian born but had grown up in Wales. The pair had teamed up to build a race-car called the "Buzz Bomb" and felt, as had Bamford and Martin before them, the Aston Martin name would give them a leg up as car makers. Bertelli would design every Aston Martin up to 1937.
A degree of financial stability arrived in 1932, according to historian Jonathan Wood, when shipping magnate Arthur Sutherland purchased Aston Martin for his son, R. Gordon Sutherland, who ran it through the 1930s and the war years.
During the late 1920s and the 1930s, Aston Martin established itself as one of Britain's true sporting makes, competing with success at Le Mans - its 1.5-litre cars sweeping their class in 1933 - at Brooklands and other venues. Profitability remained elusive, however; even in its best year of the era, 1937, it produced just 140 cars.
Tractor-maker David Brown bought the firm for £20,000 in 1947 after reading a for-sale ad in The Times. He added another big name, Lagonda, a year later.
Brown had purchased an empty factory and a prototype saloon car called the Atom, but soon transformed this into the DB1 roadster of 1948, only a few of which were built. He then launched the DB2 in 1950, into a decade in which the Aston Martin name was a force in sports car racing - finally winning Le Mans in 1959, something it did again in 2007 - and even briefly in Formula One.
Always there to spoil the fun was that profitability thing. Brown stepped aside in 1972, and it needed rescuing again in 1975, with Toronto's George Minden taking on the challenge, and once more in 1981. Then Ford stepped in in 1987, and bought all of it in 1993. In 2007, it was sold to a consortium headed by British motorsport company Prodrive.
After building less than 15,000 cars in its first 90 years, it has produced 45,000 since moving to new quarters in Gaydon in 2003. And things appear to be looking up again for this grand old marque, which recently introduced the million-pound-plus One-77 supercar, and last year, a new range-topping Vanquish.
Last fall, European investment firm InvestIndustrial ponied up £150-million for a 37.5 per cent stake, which will help Aston Martin realize plans to invest half a billion pounds in new products and technology in the next five years.
In Canada, Grand Touring Automobiles in Toronto and agencies in Calgary and Vancouver sell 70 or so a year, with prices starting at $130,000 for a V-8 Vantage, $195,000 for the recently upgraded DB9 and $295,000 for the by-order-only, new Vanquish.

Full text:   In 2011, Dellen Millard was young, rich and heir to a thriving business. Now he's charged with murder as police scour his farmland
Two and a half years ago, Dellen Millard envisioned a life of rural leisure when he first laid eyes on the quiet section of farmland along Roseville Road. It was a 20-minute drive south of the Waterloo, Ont., airport where he would soon work alongside his father, Wayne, in a new state-of-the-art hangar owned by the family firm. He could imagine building his dream home there alongside the corn and barley crops, settling down with the woman he introduced to a local real-estate agent as his fiancee.
His outlook at the time could be summarized in the word he would have tattooed on his wrist: "ambition."
The deal closed in May, 2011. The price: $835,000, all cash.
Within two years, his father would be dead, Mr. Millard would stand accused of murdering an Ancaster, Ont., father and his bucolic piece of land would come to symbolize an appalling end rather than a fresh beginning.
Forensic investigators are slated to wrap up a one-week search of Mr. Millard's farmland and the hangar on Saturday, a hunt that has uncovered a portable livestock incinerator and the charred remains of Tim Bosma.
The strange circumstances around Mr. Bosma's death - as well as the first-degree murder charge laid against a modest, young man of means - have vaulted the sad and vexing story to national attention.
On Monday, May 6, 32-year-old Tim Bosma left his wife and two-year-old daughter at his Ancaster home to take two strangers - a tall man and short man - for a test drive in his black 2007 Dodge Ram. He never returned.
His disappearance confounded police for days until a man came forward with an eerie story of two similar men who had taken his red Dodge Ram for a test drive a day earlier. He recalled an "ambition" tattoo on the tall man's wrist.
Four days after Mr. Bosma's disappearance, police tailed Mr. Millard for at least four hours before arresting him and later charging him with forcible confinement, theft over $5,000 and, eventually, first-degree murder.
Through his lawyer, Deepak Paradkar, Mr. Millard has denied all charges. Mr. Paradkar characterized his client as the wealthy heir to his family's aviation business who had no debts and no need to steal a used truck.
Police are looking for two more suspects - the short man and the driver of an "SUV-type" vehicle that appeared to be following Mr. Bosma's Dodge as it pulled away from his home.
Mr. Bosma's family, meanwhile, has scheduled a public memorial on Wednesday at Carmen's banquet hall in Hamilton.
While the Bosma family grieves, those who know Mr. Millard are perplexed by the charges against him. The real-estate agent, Bruce Nicholson, recalled a business-savvy young man who never flaunted his money and had a keen eye for trucks, including Mr. Nicholson's new Chevy Avalanche. "We talked, you know, how do you like yours? What's it got? You know, like guys do about their trucks. It was always quite easy and friendly," Mr. Nicholson said.
For Mr. Nicholson, the story doesn't add up, especially the part about Mr. Millard allegedly stealing Mr. Bosma's six-year-old truck, "when he can write a cheque for a half a dozen new ones," he said.
One friend of Mr. Millard's girlfriend shared the impression of him as a modest man who acted neither spoiled nor particularly well-off. "He's a soft-spoken sort of a guy," said the friend, who cannot be named due to a publication ban. "I didn't even know he had money. He never acted like it."
Though the two never became close, the friend said Mr. Millard seemed to treat his girlfriend well, taking her on skydiving trips and tropical vacations.
The investigation into Mr. Millard's alleged involvement in the Bosma murder has forced investigators to consider some macabre possibilities. A relative of one man questioned by Bosma investigators told The Globe and Mail the interview included questions about the 2012 death of Dellen's father, Wayne.
Police are also re-examining his relationship to Laura Babcock, a Toronto woman who went missing last July, according to a CTV News report.
Toronto Police said Wayne's death on Nov. 29, 2012, was deemed a suicide at the time. Nearly six months later, the Ontario Chief Coroner's office says the investigation into Wayne's death remains "ongoing."
The death halted ambitions for the Waterloo hangar. Established by Dellen's grandfather, Carl, in the early 1960s, Millardair was moving from Pearson International Airport to an $8-million hangar in Waterloo. The company would operate as one of only a couple of privately owned aircraft repair hangars in Ontario that could maintain jets as large as Boeing 757s.
But when Wayne, who was in his early 70s, died suddenly last fall, Dellen put his father's plans on ice, laying off staff and cancelling a key certificate from Transport Canada. Instead, he put the hangar up for lease and continued to store his collection of cars and aircraft there.
However, a contractor who worked on the hangar said Mr. Millard wasn't the type to tinker on engines himself. "I've never seen his hands dirty that way. I didn't find him that mechanically inclined," the contractor said.
In fact, once when Mr. Millard needed some space he took a cutting torch and removed some structural components from the building, the contractor said. "That's something you don't do and I told him we have to put it back. And if he was a little more mechanically inclined, he would know that."
Still, the recent developments don't add up for the contractor.
"They have no problem with money. He'll spend however many thousands on vehicles and airplanes and things. What's the story with him buying an old truck? There's something not right."

Condo builders push merits of concrete

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/condo-builders-push-merits-concrete/docview/1352822229/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "One of the major reasons we choose to build in concrete," explains David Evans, development manager of Cressey, "is that the experience of the homeowner living there is better. The benefits of concrete construction that the end user enjoys are sound attenuation and durability." He also notes that concrete, famously called "the marble of our time" by Arthur Erickson, allows "a certain freedom of architectural expression."

Full text:   Traditional timber frame has low cost going for it, but architects and builders are sold on concrete's durability
The current vogue for using high-tech wood products as a green building material has spawned a flurry of proposals for "timber towers."
But some new concrete low-rise projects in the Vancouver area seem to be going against the grain. Developers, like the I4 Property Group in North Vancouver whose 700 Marine project is scheduled for completion in July, and Cressey Development, whose new four-storey Arbutus Ridge project has sold more than 50 per cent of its 49 units since it went to market in early May, are opting for concrete, as opposed to wood-frame, construction.
Proponents of concrete cite advantages that include acoustic privacy, building quality and return on investment. Its "green" qualities include durability and energy efficiency.
But the concrete low-rise is far from the industry norm, since a wood frame is generally a cheaper option both for the builder and the consumer. It's a popular building form in cities like Barcelona - and it's slowly gaining ground in Vancouver.
Sotheby's real estate agent David Thomas, who represents the four-storey 700 Marine project, says that "buyers come here specifically because it's a concrete building."
While the 26-unit project is an island in a sea of wood-frame condos it's one that attracts a discerning buyer.
"For the West Coast climate," explains Mr. Thomas, "wood is less than ideal as a building material since it expands and contracts. Concrete is more durable."
In a typical mixed-use development, for instance, where the ground floor is usually concrete, "wood adjacent to concrete foundations - well that's going to cause some problems."
He contends that this project attracts a "wiser clientele who are more sophisticated and prepared to pay extra to have peace of mind and quality." He also notes that concrete buildings depreciate less than wood frame.
Acoustic issues are also paramount in buyer's minds, he contends, recalling a wood frame project he represented recently where, from the ground floor he could hear "every word buyers said" at the upstairs sales centre.
In a typical wood-frame building, he notes, floors might be concrete but in reality are only a "thin membrane over top of wood."
In a special "why buy concrete" addendum to the project website, other advantages are cited, including more allergen-free ventilation than in mould-producing wood frames, as well as structural safety, lower repair and maintenance costs and a greater sense of comfort and privacy.
"There's an emerging market for the concrete low- and mid-rise," contends Mr. Thomas, "especially on Vancouver's West side, North Shore and at UBC."
"People get enamoured with fancy taps and display centres - but the important thing is the structure, and concrete is built to last."
"Building with concrete gives you more flexibility," notes Hani Lammam, vice-president of Cressey. "A four-storey wood-frame structure is forced to stack. The detailing restricts you because you have to protect it - which is not an issue with concrete."
It's also a better investment for the buyer, he contends. "The advantages of concrete are undeniable. There are higher construction costs but it's a premium product and has a higher resale value. It stands up to the test of time."
Furthermore, he notes, " In a wood-frame building, the wood shrinks and you have to deal with settlement, leaks and cracks."
He concedes that wood "can be durable if protected, but these wood-frame buildings don't seem to last as long. Maintenance is difficult in multifamily settings. It's hard to motivate owner groups to do the maintenance. A concrete building form is simply easier to maintain."
"One of the major reasons we choose to build in concrete," explains David Evans, development manager of Cressey, "is that the experience of the homeowner living there is better. The benefits of concrete construction that the end user enjoys are sound attenuation and durability." He also notes that concrete, famously called "the marble of our time" by Arthur Erickson, allows "a certain freedom of architectural expression."
And with the average size of units 1,200 square feet - something that's had to find in a concrete condo in Vancouver - Mr. Evans affirms that the Arbutus Ridge site was ideal.
"We needed to be within an established neighbourhood - where real estate buyers would recognize value and have the wherewithal to purchase units with high end finishings and appliances - finishings one would expect in single family home - but in a condo."
Indeed many of the purchasers to date have been empty nesters downsizing from the plethora of 2,500-square-foot single family homes in the area, looking for both the convenience of condo living and sound construction values.
"Given their druthers everyone would prefer a concrete building," says developer Michael Geller, whose 2004 concrete mid rise at SFU's Univercity was a local pioneer of the form. "It feels more solid."
Mr. Geller says that he predicted a local trend toward mid-rise concrete buildings a few years ago, as an alternative to the typical tower and podium Vancouverist form of densification - one that offered more intimate scale and massing.
"Although the concrete mid rise was common in Toronto and Montreal," explains Mr. Geller, "15 years ago it was simply not done in B.C. - mainly because the local construction industry was not familiar with it and so the premium was quite high."
But as the local industry becomes more familiar with the form, he contends, the premium for the concrete low- and mid-rises has dropped, making it more attractive to developers.
"There are still a lot of people who are reluctant to pay a high price for a wood-frame building," he notes, "and in Vancouver when land price alone is almost equal to construction price - then it makes more sense to pay the additional premium for concrete construction."

Full text:   Toronto's Design Agency opens its latest work for European hostel chain Generator in Barcelona
jmays@globeandmail.com
No architectural types register shifts in popular taste and fashion more quickly than urban, style-conscious dwellings meant to be lived in for just one night. If you want to catch up on the latest trend in interior design, for example, there's no place better to start than the lobby or lounge of the newest boutique hotel near you.
Hostels, on the other hand, have long been another story. For most of their history since the end of the Second World War, when a backpacking adventure in Europe again became a rite of passage for young Canadians and Americans, these shelters have been bare-bones and barracks-like dormitories for kids on the move. Nobody expected them to be any more luxurious than that.
But in recent years, the pan-European Generator chain of temporary digs has been transforming the reputation of its facilities from spartan to chic, and even cool. And there's a Canadian angle here, insofar as the outfitting of Generator's hostels (which also feature some low-cost hotel rooms) has been handed off to the Toronto-based Design Agency. Partners Allen Chan, Matt Davis and Anwar Mekhayech have so far done Generator interiors in Dublin, Hamburg and Copenhagen. The firm's latest handiwork, executed by team leader Matt Davis, went public earlier this week in Barcelona's culturally various Gràcia district.
Each year in August, this neighbourhood hosts the celebrated Festa Major de Gràcia, the city's biggest open-air party. Along with many other activities, the eight-day event pits street against street in a contest to determine which thoroughfare is sporting the most exuberant decoration. As Mr. Davis explained to me last week, it was with this exciting civic spectacle in mind that he went about crafting the interior of the Barcelona Generator.
If snapshots can be believed, Mr. Davis has created high-impact public spaces that successfully capture the verve of the hostel/hotel's hometown and that will likely have keen aesthetic appeal for budget-minded travelling folk who are hipper these days than they used to be.
Coming off the Carre de Còsega into the hotel lobby through a wall of glass the width of the eight-storey former office building, visitors will find themselves in a festive jam-up of colours and shapes. The predominating hue is orange on orange, accented by blue-sizzling red or fruity or earthy oranges on the furniture and in the busily patterned floor tiles.
Overhead, the sunny block-party theme is reinforced by a thicket of some 300 orange and white hanging lanterns shaped from stretched polyester, taffeta and other translucent materials. Mr. Davis said that Barcelona artist Julie Plottier made this delightful lighting installation under the influence of the lamps that festoon local streets during the Festa Major. Other striking elements in the lobby design include the intricate, over-the-top wall coverings by Tres Tintas Barcelona, a company that specializes in the manufacture of eye-dazzling papers.
After reaching into the local history of fun and decor for the hotel lobby, Mr. Davis looked in another direction - the city's marine past - while thinking about the reception area of the hostel. At the centre of this part of the building, a large, dramatic swirl of long timbers is meant to resemble the skeletons of boat hulls and recall Barcelona's ship-building traditions. Here, as in the hotel lobby, the designer has let himself be guided by local sights and sounds and memories, which have proved to be fertile sources.
"We were struck by Barcelona's rich planning, architecture, art and design," Mr. Davis said, "and how its historic treasures are now woven with its energetic contemporary culture, fashion and graffiti. We were also inspired to become part of the trajectory of artists and designers who have, over time, responded to this city's vibrancy and beauty."
Unfortunately, he believes, many of this Generator's guests - chiefly people between the ages of 18 and 35, wanderers over long distances and among numerous European cities - will take in only a fraction of Barcelona's "vibrancy and beauty." They will, instead, merely catch the highlights, such as the famous, strange pilgrimage church of La Sagrada Familia and other masterpieces by the Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí - and overlook the street-level vibe Mr. Davis has come to admire over the three years he has been working on this project.
Hence, the intentions that have informed his development of the Generator design: to cultivate local artists and artisans and styles - "to pay homage to the experience of the city, which is larger than just a tourist destination," he said, "to open your eyes to it." With this work, Matt Davis has given to a fine city an image of its best self, which is no more than we should expect from every designer of the rooms we pass through on our travels.

Full text:   Sales fell in April on a year-over-year basis in about 60 per cent of the local markets, compared to more than 90 per cent of local markets in March
REAL ESTATE REPORTER
+2.2%: Increase in the MLS Home Price Index over April, 2012
+0.6%: Increase in seasonally adjusted national sales from March to April, the second month in a row sales have risen
-3.1%: Decline in actual sales activity over April, 2012, compared with a decline of more than 15 per cent in March over March, 2012
*****
The housing market is doing precisely what policy makers in Ottawa set out to achieve, cooling down without flaming out.
The number of homes that changed hands over the Multiple Listing Service in April was just 3 per cent lower than a year ago on an annual basis, compared with a 15-per-cent drop in March. April's relatively small decline comes on the heels of average declines that topped 13 per cent during the previous five months, noted Royal Bank of Canada economist Robert Hogue.
Economists say the latest data imply that the market is coasting toward the soft landing that Finance Minister Jim Flaherty and Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney have been seeking. They expect sales this spring to edge upward, but not to return to the blistering pace of early last year.
The signs of a thaw in the Canadian housing market are especially encouraging heading into the all-important spring home-buying season, said Toronto-Dominion Bank economist Sonya Gulati. But she added that she does not expect sales to rebound significantly in coming months.
"There simply is no economic impetus for a full-fledged comeback in the cards," she wrote in a research note. "In turn, the 2013 spring home-buying season should be mediocre at best."
That will be welcome news to policy makers, because a revival of the housing market at this stage could once again raise fears of a bubble, something that Mr. Flaherty has suggested has not occurred so far. In a bid to keep it that way, he coaxed banks into backing off from some ultralow five-year mortgage rates in March.
"Generationally low borrowing costs will continue to provide underlying support to domestic housing activity," Bank of Nova Scotia economist Adrienne Warren wrote in a research note.
"At the same time, however, high home prices and tighter mortgage rules are squeezing affordability, especially for first-time homebuyers."
Over all, Ms. Warren expects Canadians to remain more cautious about borrowing and spending.
Thirty-year-old Daniel Collins-Forrester had been looking at homes for the past year and bought his first house, a bungalow in Oshawa, Ont., last month. Over the course of the time he was looking, he noticed more buyers actively on the hunt for homes.
"There was more competition than I'd thought," he said.
Sales fell in April on a year-over-year basis in about 60 per cent of the local markets that the Canadian Real Estate Association tracks; that was still an improvement from March, when sales declined in more than 90 per cent of local markets.
Home prices as measured by the MLS Home Price Index were up 2.2 per cent from a year earlier, the smallest gain in more than two years. But they are still rising faster than inflation, and prices are at all-time highs, pointed out Bank of Montreal economist Doug Porter.
"Despite the very loud gnashing of teeth and excessive wringing of hands for well over a year on the topic, Canadian home prices remain incredibly calm, cool, and collected," he said.
There are regional variations. Calgary saw sales rise 10.4 per cent and its average selling price rise 3.6 per cent from a year ago, to $429,717 from $414,932. In Toronto, where sales fell 5.2 per cent, the average selling price rose 1.7 per cent to $526,335 from $517,556. Vancouver, which led sales declines last year, saw sales fall 6 per cent, while the average selling price rose by 0.6 per cent from a year ago to $739,587.
The number of newly listed homes in April came in 0.9-per-cent below March, and the decline in new listings has been a key factor that's kept home prices from full-scale retreat despite the double-digit correction in sales, said Mr. Hogue, the RBC economist.
"The interesting - and often overlooked - development in the past year or so has been the restraint on the supply side of the market," he wrote in a note. "The cooling of the market, in fact, took place on both sides of the equation - buyers and sellers."
And the wider economic situation is unlikely to upset that balance, Bank of Montreal economist Sal Guatieri said. "Unlike the early 1990s experience with double-digit unemployment and mortgage rates, or the more recent U.S. subprime credit debacle, Canadian home owners are under no pressure to sell amid record-low interest rates and relatively low joblessness."

Full text:   A weakening B.C. economy will weigh heavily on whichever party forms the government after Tuesday's provincial election.
British Columbia's outlook is dogged by slower economic growth in China, slumping commodity prices and questions surrounding how durable the recovery in U.S housing starts will be.
And there's the slump in the local real estate market, which has seen both prices and sales activity fall.
"Whoever is going to win power in the election is going to come into office presiding over an economy that is growing at a very sluggish pace, with a lot of uncertainties and risks out there," Jock Finlayson, executive vice-president of the Business Council of British Columbia, said in an interview Monday.
In the short term, there is little influence that any newly elected government will be able to exert on the provincial economy, said Hamish Telford, head of the political science department at the University of the Fraser Valley.
While the NDP and Liberals have sought to highlight their differences on tax policies during the election campaign, "they appear to be different only at the margins," Mr. Telford said.
For instance, the NDP is proposing relatively small shifts such as raising corporate income tax rates slightly higher than the Liberals, he noted.
Over the longer term, greater policy differences emerge.
The NDP in particular has raised concerns about fracking in natural gas production, and the party has vowed to reverse a decision by the B.C. Liberals to streamline provincial environmental reviews with the Canadian Environmental Assessment Agency.
The Liberals charge that the NDP would harm the economy, but New Democrats counter that they support job creation in a sustainable fashion.
The B.C. Liberals have been in power since 2001, while the province's New Democratic Party is seeking to win its first B.C. general election since 1996.
The business council forecasts that the province's economy will grow by 1.6 per cent this year, down slightly from an estimated 1.7 per cent last year. British Columbia's growth in real gross domestic product has slowed, compared with 2.6 per cent in 2011.
"We're not changing our 2013 forecast based on who wins the election. We will revisit the forecast later in the year once we see a new budget," Mr. Finlayson said.
For British Columbia, which is banking on increased exports to China to help bolster the province, strong lumber prices have been a pleasant surprise. The rebound in U.S. housing starts has provided a welcome lift to long-suffering B.C. lumber producers. Many of those producers have diversified beyond the United States over the years by selling wood products to Asian customers.
Natural gas markets are showing early signs of staging a recovery.
But a range of other commodities have slumped over the past 18 months, notably prices for coal, copper and zinc - hurt by fears of China's economy taking a breather, PricewaterhouseCoopers said in a report on B.C.'s mining industry.
The Liberals and NDP have touted the potential in exporting liquefied natural gas.
Still, it will take years for the fledgling LNG industry to become a reality, and even then, it is unclear how many projects will go from the drawing board to the production, pipeline and shipping phase.
Two oil pipeline proposals, Northern Gateway and the planned expansion of the Trans Mountain system, are touted by the energy industry as crucial to helping boost Canadian exports.
Those proposals, however, face high hurdles. The NDP, for instance, opposes Kinder Morgan Canada Inc.'s Trans Mountain plans to increase oil tanker traffic at the Port of Vancouver.
Both the Liberals and NDP have expressed major concerns about Northern Gateway.

Full text:   John Paton, chief executive officer, Digital First Media
MEDIA REPORTER
For John Paton, the future of journalism looks nothing like it used to.
But you can't let the struggles of a beloved industry ruin your lunch, even if lunch is little more than a salad and a few small pieces of raw salmon washed down with a glass of water. Mr. Paton's waist is contracting alongside the newspaper advertising market in the United States, but that's the type of loss you can brag about whenever anyone notices that you've been eating less and taking longer walks.
The topic of print advertising is awkward for many in the industry to talk about openly. Lately, it has been declining at a double-digit pace; the venerable New York Times Co., for instance, recorded a 13.3 per cent decline in newspaper advertising in the first quarter.
Mr. Paton, who got his start as a copy boy at the Toronto Sun, is now in charge of one of America's largest newspaper groups, one with more than 75 daily newspapers in the United States and their affiliated digital properties through Digital First Media. He has also fashioned himself as something of a guru on the new world of selling news in the digital age -- a reputation he carries despite the apparent lack of financial success of some of the entities he manages, such as Journal Register Co., which last year filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for the second time in three years.
Mr. Paton is undeterred. He sees a fleeting opportunity to build a new industry on the back of the old.
"The business of newspapering has to become the business of maximizing free cash flow to feed the new, growing businesses," he says, swatting away a steady stream of waiters who keep trying to take his salad before he's finished. "Is anyone arguing print isn't challenged forever and a day? Of course it is. Is anyone arguing there's a bottom? Of course there's not. The idea is to recognize that and start building new businesses while you have the opportunity to do so."
Mr. Paton has become one of the most outspoken advocates of the digitization of news since being named Publisher of the Year by Editor & Publisher in 2009, insisting the old models should only continue to exist to fund the creation of new ones. He still loves newspapers, he says, but it's an increasingly one-sided relationship.
"Look," he says. "There's a realization that if the largest part of your business is legacy, it needs to become something else. The question is - what does it become? And the answer to that is, 'Not what it is today.' And that's why you need to build the revenue streams and cost structures to build whatever that is going to be, fully realizing you'll need to fund all of that from the profits of your printed products."
It's a strategy that not everyone buys into, including, Mr. Paton says, some of his own employees. He gets the criticism, but tries to bat it down by saying the Journal Register bankruptcy filings are about getting rid of legacy costs.
"The bankruptcy has everything to do with pension issues, debt and real estate and has nothing to do with performance," he says. "But it becomes about a bankruptcy of ideas, so you need a thick skin. They come at me because I've been so loud about having all the answers. I used to be really comfortable saying that. These days it's pretty uncomfortable."
Mr. Paton spends most of his time planning for a newspaper-free future from a downtown Manhattan newsroom he has named the Thunderdome. It bears little resemblance to the gladiatorial arena from Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome , but there is a battle being waged within its walls as he squeezes whatever money he can out of his newspapers in order to finance their eventual digital replacements.
The Thunderdome was created to provide national and foreign news to all of the company's newsrooms, allowing reporters in each community to focus on local news and ad representatives to focus solely on digital sales. The journalists (and techies) in New York are able to take over any of the paper's websites when news breaks, supplementing their coverage and providing additional resources when needed.
Combined, the chains that the Thunderdome feeds - Journal Register Co. and MediaNews Group Inc., which includes the Pulitzer Prize-winning Denver Post and the San Jose Mercury News - would be the second-largest newspaper company in the United States behind USA Today's Gannett Corp., with 2.9 million subscribers across the country. Its hundreds of websites attract 50 million viewers each month, and the company has rolled out hundreds of apps to get content in front of readers.
Mr. Paton has been vocal in his opposition to paywalls, which are becoming more common as news organizations look for ways to compensate for falling advertising revenues. (The Globe and Mail is one of the news organizations that now limits the amount of free content readers can get online.)
"I think people will pay for things that are worth paying for," he says. "And I would argue that at general interest newspapers, there is a small chance that equals what's in the paper and that's why I don't like paywalls. There's a larger chance to build apps - true standalone products that are different from the Web and different from newspapers. People will buy things that they use differently."
Many of the local newspapers begrudge their increasingly digital focus and the money spent in New York: Mr. Paton estimates 30 per cent of his 10,000 employees are against his plans. Local reporters question why digital journalists thousands of miles away have new computers when they tap away on ancient desktops. Waves of layoffs have also shaken their faith. Thousands of employees have been handed pink slips as he centralizes functions and eliminates duplicated jobs across the dozens of papers (although the number of journalists on his payroll has remained relatively stable, he says).
There are signs he's on to something - he wrote in a note to employees that digital revenue increased at Journal Register Co. by 164 per cent from 2009 to 2012 and the company's digital audience doubled. Across all of his papers, digital revenue is up 20 per cent annually at a time the industry has advanced by low single-digits.
But for all the progress he's made on the digital side, critics have seized on the bankruptcy as proof that his Thunderdome-inspired digital revolution works better in theory than it does in real life. Digital revenue may be up, but they argue the company's decision to bleed its print products to chase "digital dimes" is likely to end badly.
While his strategy plays out high above the streets of Manhattan, Mr. Paton's tactics are slowly working their way through Canada's largest metropolitan newspaper chain. Mr. Paton spent the early years of his career lined up beside Paul Godfrey at Sun Media, and is now a member of Mr. Godfrey's inner circle since taking up a director's seat at Postmedia Network Canada Corp., publisher of the National Post, Calgary Herald and other large Canadian dailies.
He won't talk about official Postmedia business as he eats his lunch, and winces when he's asked about how he came to be sitting in Michael's New York, a mid-town hot spot that pulls in a steady stream of media big shots throughout the day. It's a long way from his days at the Toronto Sun, where he got his start in 1977 by walking into the newsroom with picture of a prominent Torontonian frolicking with a belly dancer named Minka.
"This isn't going to be a story about a plucky little copy boy who rose to become almost a mogul, is it?" he asks, half joking. "It's a little tired."
But there's no denying the importance of his time at Sun Media, which he departed shortly after Quebecor Inc. bought the chain in 1998 and built it into the largest newspaper company in Canada by number of titles. He went from copy boy to reporter, to city editor, to editor, to publisher to general manager and helped developed Canoe - one of Canada's first news portals that is still a key piece of Quebecor's media empire in 2013.
But that was then, and he says things have changed.
He knows there are scores of skeptics lined up against him, many of them firmly ensconced in the newspapers he owns across the country. But there is a flip side - if he's made the wrong bet, there will be fewer newspaper journalists around to rub it in.

Full text:   Coal Harbour's over-abundance of part-time condo residents creates a downtown district without a heartbeat
kgold@globeandmail.com
Nearing retirement age but nowhere near ready to retire, real estate agent Tim Hiltz and his husband, horticulturalist Mark Hiltz, decided they'd realize a long-held dream of opening a garden and plant store, with an emphasis on local and sustainable products.
The real estate market had slowed for Tim, so the time seemed right for their retail venture. They figured Coal Harbour would be the ideal location for their new venture, what with the thousands of condo dwellers and all those little balconies in need of greening. They opened Coal Harbour Green Design 11 months ago, and geared their store to balcony-sized gardens, with space-saving wall-mounted planters and self-watering containers for the couple who travel.
Their clientele came from all over the world, and they enjoyed the interaction. But they soon discovered that their customers were mostly part-time residents, people who spent only a few weeks or months in Vancouver and couldn't take on the responsibility of a garden.
They already knew a lot of the condos were investor-owned and empty, but they didn't know a hefty share of them are occupied for only a few months a year, Tim says.
"One lady said to me, 'I'd love to have beautiful flowers on my balcony, but I'm here for only two months out of the year,'" says Tim, who has written to the city to try to do something to stimulate growth in the area.
He sees three main groups making up the bulk of Coal Harbour's transient population; those from abroad, Americans and snowbirds.
"People come from the Middle East, they come from Taiwan, China, Singapore, Korea, from all over. There's a component from the United States, because it gets too hot in Arizona or Palm Springs during the summer so they come up here, where the climate is so much milder.
"And then the third component is moms and dads who've retired and sold their Point Grey home and have gone into a Coal Harbour condo. They go away for the winter."
After brisk business for most of the summer, September brought a huge drop-off in customers. Many explained they were returning home to the U.S., the Middle East or Asia. Some asked the Hiltzes to over-winter their plants until they returned in the spring.
With a 21/2-year lease, they plowed on. Tim says Mark loves "the Christmas bling," so they decorated the store and stocked it to the rafters with Christmas paraphernalia. Then they waited for customers. And they waited. During the entire month of December, they sold perhaps one $20 item, he says. It hit them hard.
The Hiltzes realized they'd made a huge mistake by trying to make a go of it in Coal Harbour. In March, Tim wrote to the mayor and council explaining that, as things stand, there is simply not enough of a community to sustain a business. With so few people about, Tim was also noticing more graffiti and anti-social behaviour.
"With that absence of people and absence of life at a street level, what do you have left for those seven months of the year? You have a very empty, very desolate, very cold environment. This belongs to the people of Vancouver - the waterfront and seawall. It's incumbent upon the City of Vancouver to bring vibrancy to the community whether that be in the form of public events or really changing the way we look at Coal Harbour as a public resource."
Down the street from their business, two other storefronts are empty.
The Hiltzes have now decided to close shop and suggest that whoever takes over their lease should run a business that isn't dependent on foot traffic, such as a hair salon or doctor's office with a built-in clientele. They will continue in the garden business, but no longer in a retail capacity.
"Someone came in the other day and said that Coal Harbour doesn't have a heartbeat," Tim says. "I thought that nailed it. There is nobody here. It's gorgeous, with this view of the water and marina and mountains, but there are no people.
"... [A]bout one-quarter of the condos are empty here, that's true, but when you add into that this component of non-resident owners who come here for a five-month period, that leaves the area empty for seven months of the year. You can't run a business with that."

Full text:   Described as 'Natural Modern,' house embodies a rustic, rural sensibility in a distinctly suburban setting
jmays@globeandmail.com
Over the course of his career as a custom home designer active in Mississauga, David Small has tailored his work to fit the tastes of all manner of clients. He has done Arts and Crafts bungalows, Tudor mansions, French Provincial chateaux, Cape Cod cottages and houses cast in yet other styles out of the all-too-predictable suburban pattern book.
But when the time came to fashion a new 3,800-square-foot dwelling for himself, his wife and twin daughters, Mr. Small threw that popular book out the window and took a chance on modernism. The recently completed result, which stands in Mississauga's comfortable, forested Gordon Woods neighbourhood, is original, though not radical enough to shake up the neighbours, staid but not fusty, and altogether fresh and clean-lined. The designer calls its look "natural modern." As things have turned out, that's an apt handle for what he has done.
The "natural" part of Mr. Small's phrase refers to two significant properties of the scheme. One is the prominence he has given to rural materials, inside and out. The soffits under the deep roof overhangs are lined with warm unpainted wood, and the rhythmically opening and shutting exterior is a combination of glass and stacked Wiarton limestone blocks. At the heart of the interior is a fireplace of limestone, and a hearth made from a huge chunk of the Canadian Shield quarried in Ontario's French River district.
The design is also "natural" in the sense of "relaxed." Mr. Small has delivered a design that is forthrightly modernist, though it has none of the sharp elbows and knees that some people think of when they hear the words "modern" and "house" mentioned in the same breath. Like other local residential designers whose work I've been seeing lately, Mr. Small has learned a thing or two from the European pioneers of the modern movement in architecture - things like economy of gesture, the importance of flow between inside and outside, and compositional clarity - but more from North America's modern makers of solidly upper-middle-class housing.
The key figure here is Frank Lloyd Wright, and the key works in the ancestry of this design are Mr. Wright's famous houses in the so-called "prairie style." It's a lineage that Mr. Small readily acknowledges, though any architecturally savvy visitor to his project would be able to spot Mr. Wright's fingerprints without being told where to look.
Take, for example, the overhanging eaves of the strongly horizontal roofline, which handsomely cap each tall exterior wall and hold the vertical thrusts of the façade in check. And there are those clerestory windows high up the double-height walls of the open-plan dining area.
A less Wright-like touch is what might be called the "staging" of the house - by which I mean the shaping of the front façade and the zone in front of it to dramatize the grade-change between the entry level and the street. Leaving this house is not a matter of stepping from front door to sidewalk. One descends, instead, by way of a series of small plateaus, each a little lower than the one before it. The result is a graceful transition that deliberately distances the house from the city around it.
That distancing is, in fact, the aspect of the house that sets it farthest apart from the classic dwellings in the "prairie style." Though Mr. Wright surely meant his homes for the well-off to look firmly rooted in the open landscape of the American mid-west, the residential buildings he designed are resolutely urbane and sophisticated. They belong in cities (or posh suburbs), and they would look odd if dropped into the countryside.
Mr. Small's spacious family house, on the other hand, owes a large, direct debt to the Ontario cottage, and to the cottage country where one finds these dwellings. With its rough stone cladding and great rustic hearth, it doesn't quite belong there in Gordon Woods, among the routine period knock-offs on large lots up and down the street. It's definitely city-sized and otherwise citified - but if houses dream (and I believe they do), this one is dreaming of the French River.
I mean that as just a comment about this interesting project, not a criticism. Mr. Small's residence embodies an effective infusion of much that's artistically ground-breaking in Mr. Wright's prairie-style houses by memories of Ontario's northern wilderness. "Natural modern" is probably as good a description of David Small's approach as you'll find anywhere.

Full text:   Homeowner takes the reins in a massive renovation effort
THE LISTING
Asking price:$1,780,000
Taxes: $8,770 (2012)
Lot size: 178 by 142 feet
Agent: Jocelyn Proulx, Royal LePage Your Community Realty
The back story
Dawn Miller knows Richmond Hill inside out, having lived there for nearly a quarter century. So it was obvious to her when she bought it several years ago that this 1950s bungalow on a maturely treed, corner property near a popular local landmark, Mill Pond Park, was a prime location.
"It's an established older area where people have larger lots and there's nice space between homes," she says.
"And there are lots of animals and lots of birds. We have a big porch where you can sit out in the backyard and you can hear the birds in the morning, which is quite nice."
When she bought it, the house was due for a makeover on the main floor, but once Ms. Miller began renovations, more deficiencies surfaced, from old wiring to uninsulated walls.
"Once we thought about the amount of work we had to do, we thought we should just make this a home for families who want more bathrooms, bedrooms and family space," says Ms. Miller.
What's new
With some home renovation experience already under her belt, Ms. Miller spent about three years transforming the three-bedroom and two-bathroom bungalow into a luxurious, 3,859-square-feet residence with five bedrooms and five bathrooms.
"There are parts of the foundation and wall left on the main floor, but it was basically a brand new house," says agent Jocelyn Proulx.
"When you consider the owner's design and exceptional attention to detail - along with the uncompromising quality and workmanship - there is quite frankly, no other house quite like it in the Mill Pond [area], or, for that matter, beyond the Pond."
The yellow brick shell was replaced with an Owen Sound limestone blend, cedar shingles, solid mahogany front door and a covered cedar porch that wraps around to the rear.
"It's a new home, but it looks like it's been there forever," adds Ms. Proulx, who praises the mix of styles from Mill Pond, Lawrence Park and Muskoka. "Great care was taken by the owner to ensure that the home would blend in with the natural beauty of the Mill Pond neighbourhood."
Two main floor bedrooms remain, but three more were created upstairs, including one with a gas fireplace, walk-in closet and five-piece bathroom. "The master suite on the second floor is a retreat, it takes up half the second floor," says Ms. Proulx.
The 1,947-square-foot basement was also overhauled with an open kitchen, games room and sunken media room with a second walkout to the grounds, plus a hobby room and bedroom.
Best feature
The biggest effort went into designing an open entertaining, dining and cooking area not just with oak hardwood floors, crown mouldings and pot lights nine-feet above, but an upscale Town & Country fireplace flanked by windows and walkouts on three sides, an 11-by four-foot island with quartzite counters and Viking Professional Series appliances.
"We like to entertain a lot ... so the idea of a big open family room and kitchen area really appealed to us because I could be cooking, chatting and be part of the family activities at the same time," Ms. Miller explains.
"It's very bright with a lot of garden doors, so this living space I'm sitting in right now is what I'm most proud of."

Full text:   Sohel Rana, the owner of the collapsed factory building where more than 377 garment workers are believed to have died, was known as a close aide of local ruling-party lawmaker and a man who got rich quick off real estate.
When the cracks in the building appeared early last Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Rana had assured tenants, including five garment factories, that the building was safe, reportedly telling workers that it would last 100 years.
Inspectors said the eight-storey building should be closed until it could be inspected. But Mr. Rana, who has now been arrested by Bangladeshi authorities, publicly scoffed. "The building has minor damages," he told gathering reporters. "There is nothing serious." The building collapsed on Wednesday, and Mr. Rana fled. He was arrested on Sunday.
Before the collapse, Mr. Rana was little known outside the few blocks of his tiny empire, a grid of poorly paved streets in the crowded industrial suburb of Savar, built up over the past decade or so around hundreds of garment factories.
The son of a local businessman with political connections, he became a neighbourhood force by working as an organizer for the two political parties that have competed for power for decades in Bangladesh, according to local politicians and someone who grew up near Mr. Rana and still lives in the area. In essence, these people say, Mr. Rana is a neighbourhood political enforcer, regularly ordering thousands of people into the streets for rallies.
"He doesn't belong to any particular political party," said Ashrafuddin Khan Imu, an Awami League leader and long-time Rana rival. "Whatever party is in power, he is there."
Leaders of the Awami League, the ruling party, have denied that Mr. Rana was involved with their party's youth wing, the Jubo League. But his photograph can be seen on hundreds of political posters pasted on the walls of buildings throughout Savar, showing him greeting voters on behalf of the local Awami party lawmaker. That lawmaker, Talukder Touhid Jang Murad, also denied any connection to Mr. Rana after the collapse. The next day, Dhaka newspapers printed photographs of Mr. Murad kissing Mr. Rana on the forehead after a successful rally earlier this year.
Savar residents said Mr. Rana started out working with his father, who was a cooking-oil vendor, and went on to earn money by selling jhut, waste pieces of clothing from garment factories, before acquiring the land and building factories.
The Bangladesh Anti-Corruption Commission has said it will now open an investigation into how he got the properties. Mr. Rana was in his office on the ground floor of his building when it collapsed, but managed to escape.
*****
THE POLITICS
Bangladesh politics has been dominated by the long-standing tension between the Awami League, now the ruling party, and the Bangladesh National Party. Power has swung back and forth between the two parties. The Awami League is the older of the two, having led the campaign for independence from Pakistan that led to the creation of Bangladesh in 1971. It claims its basic principles are nationalism, secularism, socialism and democracy. The BNP on its website describes itself as a centre-right party dedicated to "the Islamic consciousness of the people."
No matter which of the parties has been in power, corruption has long been rife in Bangladesh. Transparency International, an international watchdog group, said its latest survey, in 2010, found that 66 per cent of Bangladeshis reported having to pay a bribe in order to access basic services in the previous 12 months.

The Action: Only a handful of buyers ventured out to Salt Spring Island to visit this seaside residence. But it proved sufficient to snag a solid bid this winter.
What They Got: This gated, 3,012-square-foot residence on a 0.73-acre lot is easy to access by land or by water, and convenient to store vehicles and watercraft with a paved driveway to a garage and a dock jutting over the beach.
* In 2010, the original frame of this 30-year-old house was modified for contemporary style and substance, from a vaulted, sky-lit foyer to a fireside living, dining and kitchen space with dark wood floors, white tongue and groove-wood-beamed ceilings and a centre island with storage and seating.
* Private quarters include two main-floor bedrooms with private patios off the bathrooms and a lower-level guest suite and fourth bathroom off a new media room.
The Agent's Take: "It's a five or six-minute drive to the main villages of Ganges, near the Vancouver ferry and it's a nice protected bay for boaters. Those three ingredients are really desirable here," agent Chris Hobbs said. "The interior was more contemporary than what we often see on Salt Spring, almost like a Nantucket beach house."
The changes by a reputable local builder, Wilco Construction, was also a large factor in its sale, which came together within weeks rather than months like other homes.
"It defied the usual time frames on market here, however it's such a beautiful remodel it just fit a segment of the market with its dock and level of finish," Mr. Hobbs said. "Each bathroom has a walkout to outdoor spaces, which is a unique feature of the renovation."

Abstract: On the west side of the city, there are surprisingly few coffee bars. There are major gaps between Mr. [Andy Yan]'s dots. But the west side is lacking in density and flow, the two requirements for a thriving community, and coffee bars. It's this lack of flow that some have blamed for creating a city that is not connected, or is generally unfriendly. We move from A to B with little interactivity when there's no flow.

kgold@globeandmail.com
When trying to gauge the direction of our city's growth, simply follow the aroma of coffee.
There is no better telltale clue for upcoming growth than the arrival of the dedicated coffee shop, the sort of place where young professionals set up their laptop work stations for the day.
It starts with the arrival of a brave independent coffee shop, followed by another trendsetter like JJ Bean, and by the time Starbucks arrives, the neighbourhood is in full-blown growth mode.
"Starbucks requires a certain density for it to come into a neighbourhood," says Bing Thom Architects analyst Andy Yan.
Mr. Yan is the urban planner who found data that shows around one-quarter of condo units in Coal Harbour are empty. Now he's mapped out all the chain and independent coffee bars according to City of Vancouver business permit information and plotted their locations with colour-coded dots. While at Matchstick Coffee, at Kingsway and Fraser, he zoomed in and out of neighbourhoods around Vancouver on a map he'd created, displayed on his tablet. Downtown, there is a mass of green dots for all the Starbucks shops, but less than a dozen outside downtown, according to Mr. Yan.
On the west side of the city, there are surprisingly few coffee bars. There are major gaps between Mr. Yan's dots. But the west side is lacking in density and flow, the two requirements for a thriving community, and coffee bars. It's this lack of flow that some have blamed for creating a city that is not connected, or is generally unfriendly. We move from A to B with little interactivity when there's no flow. If you live in a penthouse in Coal Harbour, for example, you probably take the elevator to your car and drive to the store, unlike the person in Strathcona who'll walk to their little coffee shop.
You've got two types of coffee bars, the leading and the lagging groups. Starbucks and Tim Hortons are lagging because they need density. Shops like JJ Bean, Bean Around the World and especially the independents are leaders because they seem willing to go into unproven, marginal areas that are showing glimmers of being on the upswing.
Tim Hortons is a lagging group that often depends on transit hubs, the way Starbucks does.
"We are not necessarily a Tim Hortons kind of town," says Mr. Yan, even though there are an estimated 26 stores around Vancouver. By comparison, there are something in the order of 85 Starbucks. Then there's Waves, a bit of an outlier. They seem able to survive anything.
"They were one of the first ones in the Downtown Eastside. They are the barnacle survivor in a really hostile urban environment."
So, if you want to gauge the growth of your neighbourhood, check out the coffee bars. Fraser is obviously at the start of an upswing, with the arrival of hipster hangout Matchstick down the street from Les Faux Bourgeois restaurant, which was first to set the tone for the Kingsway and Fraser hub. It's no accident that the adult sex shop across the street has now been replaced with a doggy supplies shop. Then, further up Fraser at 27th Avenue, JJ Bean recently arrived, and at 29th Avenue there is a Starbucks. Those coffee shops are around the new condo developments.
"Starbucks will not go into an unproved market," says Richard Wozny, financial consultant for commercial real estate.
I had coffee with Mr. Wozny at a Take 5 Café in Gastown, an area that happens to have every sort of coffee shop on Mr. Yan's map within a three-block radius - a sure sign of density and flow.
"Starbucks are powerful enough to say, 'Why bother doing all this business of getting a store up and running without a guaranteed large market?' " says Mr. Wozny. "So they only go into the best locations, whereas a local store has a much lower overhead and they can go into a marginal location."
Mr. Yan's coffee shop map shows us that Vancouver's growth is entirely eastward. It's way more urban than the west side, and already has the majority of the city's most interesting restaurants and shops. Mr. Wozny said that because the west side is buttressed by water, it will never be conducive to true growth.
If growth occurs organically, like at that little Kingsway-Fraser hub, it has the effect of re-knitting the community, says Mr. Yan.
"This is the essence of great city building and what it's about. It's not about streets and houses, it's about people, and a level of community commerce. And getting out and meeting people and interacting with them. It breaks down the zombie aspect of the city," says Mr. Yan.
We took a short walk east on Kingsway and discovered Room for Cream, a brave leader that's set to entice growth eastward, in that challenging frontier that is the automotive repair strip. The newcomers, a pair of former Starbucks employees, were too late to join the Kingsway-Fraser hub because rents have already increased. So, they chose a location a couple of blocks away, which is far enough to make it a challenge. There's little foot traffic on a street that consists of an automotive repair shop, a car rental lot and an ICBC claim centre. The blocks are longer than elsewhere in the city, there are few traffic lights to slow the traffic, and the sidewalks appear an afterthought.
But owners Lawrence Tsai and Yehuda Sandler are aiming to pull customers to the area by joining the community full on, buying all their supplies and baked goods from the area and making customer service their priority. After a year in business, they already see their influence has created a healthier, happier neighbourhood. Because there is more foot traffic around, there are far fewer prostitutes. On the ground, there are fewer needles. About 40 per cent of their business is nearby auto workers, and Mr. Tsai is making a point of knowing their names.
"When we went looking for a place, we wanted somewhere that was lacking. We are pretty much right in the middle of nowhere," says Mr. Tsai. "But you are starting to see the change. We are the trend leader, and it's definitely a lot harder. We have to break people's habits so they come here."
Now, if the city would install a traffic light, they might see a reduction in traffic accidents and pedestrians who routinely risk jaywalking. If the city would also install garbage cans, they wouldn't have to spend part of their day cleaning up street trash.
But this is the nature of growth - it takes a brave little shop like Room for Cream to kick things off, and then the other retailers and customers will follow.
"What gives a house value is context," says Mr. Yan. "In a diverse and connected urban fabric, all values increase. How do you increase property values? You create community.
"I think that's why so many gravitate toward the east side - the need for community."
We've seen from the lesson at Coal Harbour that without density and flow of people, there is no community.
In other words, support your local independent coffee bar. They're building you a neighbourhood.

Full text:   In a handsome pair of semi-detached homes, architect Steven Fong bolsters his argument for an updated Modernism
jmays@globeandmail.com
Though stripped of their youthful left-wing brio and humbled by deep shifts in taste since the 1970s, the design ideas of the Bauhaus and other sources of European modernism are enjoying a long, genteel Indian summer in Toronto and other North American cities.
Architects here have brought forth, in the last dozen years, an impressive crop of new urban villas and country houses with tall walls of glass, open-plan interiors, strong boxy geometry and other trademark features of the modernist style.
And the end of consumer demand for such luxury housing is nowhere in sight.
I, for one, have welcomed this development. It is, among other useful things, a counter-weight to the tiresome practice of putting up new houses decked out in antique frocks and finery hauled down from the attic of pre-modern manners.
Not everyone, of course, shares my enthusiasm for Hogtown's brand of neo-modernist residential design.
There are and always will be people, for example, who want their houses to be pastiches of this or that obsolete fashion.
But there are other non-modernists - a far more interesting lot - who think Toronto's Bauhaus-inspired modernism has actually become routine, and even stale, and is much in need of refreshment.
Steven Fong is one local architect (and a professor at the University of Toronto's architecture school) who believes something along these lines, and has given his beliefs practical expression in a handsome pair of semi-detached dwellings on the city's east side.
"The point I want to make with these houses," he wrote in an e-mail, "is that what is currently touted as Toronto Modern is not modern.
"Bauhaus point-line-plane compositions, continuity of inside and outside, dissolving the volume in favour of planes, big walls of glass are all old-school European tropes. Ironically, [contemporary] Europeans have moved on to explore volumes that provide light interior spaces, yet at the same time offer a window-to-wall ratio that [is] better suited to our needs for energy conservation and responsive to changing sensibilities about what is a comfortable interior environment."
Mr. Fong drives home his point with grace and vigour.
Drawing on the pleasantly jaunty rhythm of contrasting facades found on the old-fashioned residential streets of the Annex neighbourhood, he has surfaced one three-level semi with black brick, and the other with light cedar slats.
One streetside face is shorter and smaller than the other - though both, like good modernist buildings, sport rooflines that are dead flat - and each has a unique, attractively irregular configuration of windows.
As you might guess from his description of what he tried to do, these window openings have been left relatively small - a nod, of course, to energy efficiency, but also a bid to create interiors that are more intimate and enclosed than those in modernism's classic glass boxes.
If the exteriors of these structures argue for a greater appreciation of Toronto's older, home-grown housing typologies - one of Mr. Fong's academic specialties - the insides strive to be as sleek and fresh as possible.
The architect is especially proud of the steel-joist frame, which allows plumbing and electrical conduits to run through the skeleton of the house, thereby eliminating the need for bulkheads in the open-plan rooms.
Heating is supplied by hot-water pipes embedded in the concrete floors and the hot water itself comes from a high-performance Viessmann boiler that is compact enough to fit into a broom closet.
But there is more to these interiors than gadgetry and up-to-date engineering.
They have a more intangible quality: flair. The appointments of the bathrooms and bedrooms - especially the master bedroom suites that fill the whole top floors of both houses - are meant to possess what Mr. Fong calls "the level of finish and amenity associated with hipster hotel environments."
In the case of these private houses, this sensuous design impulse translates into tubs that hover in the large bathrooms, and patterns of circulation between bed and bath that are uninterrupted by doors or partitions.
The architect has brought to these residences the lessons he has learned about social space from doing some of Queen Street West's coolest destinations, including Parts and Labour bar and restaurant and the soon-to-open Beverley Hotel. The success of Mr. Fong's east-end houses suggests Toronto's current practitioners of architectural modernism, good as they are, still have a thing or two to learn from his version of hipsterism and even from the venerable streetscapes of the Annex.

Full text:   With five new office projects planned or coming on stream, moderate growth is the watchword for the downtown by the Bow
The demand for office space in Calgary has dampened a little amid a degree of uncertainty about prospects for the all-important energy sector, but real estate players say they aren't expecting anything more than a blip.
The health of Calgary's office market still rests on the success of major oil and gas firms, although downtown developers note that the city's boom-bust nature has been tempered. The region's economy and government coffers are largely dependent on the energy sector as well, and the province dramatically cut its forecasted resource revenues this year, resulting in rising deficit projections.
Natural gas prices have been under pressure, and some heavy-oil producers have scaled back expansion plans and cut budgets as the prolonged difficulty of transporting Western Canada's heavy oil to other markets has resulted in price discounts.
After a go-go period during which vacancy rates were falling and rents were rising, this year feels like a bit of a lull. Many tenants are stuck in a holding pattern.
The industry has been long awaiting news on pipelines that could be a boon for the sector. But U.S. government approval of TransCanada's Keystone XL pipeline, which would carry crude from the oil sands to U.S. markets, is facing fierce opposition from environmental groups. And if the NDP wins British Columbia's current election, then Enbridge's Northern Gateway pipeline - which would carry crude to the coast to be sent to Asia - will face a new review.
Amid the resulting uncertainty, a growing number of Calgary office tenants have been subletting space, suggesting they now need less room than they originally thought when they signed their leases.
On the flip side, the discount on Canadian oil has been dissipating, natural gas prices have picked up this month, and players say that all it would take is one piece of good news - such as the approval of one of the pipelines - to get the market revving again.
Cushman & Wakefield Canada CEO Pierre Bergevin calls Calgary "the most dynamic market in the country."
"We've seen some shelving of oil and gas projects that now is trickling down and impacting the energy companies, and therefore the engineering companies, and some of that space is coming back onto the market," he said.
But he adds that "if the prices of oil and gas rebound, you'll see a renewed demand for the engineering firms taking up space. And if either the XL or the Gateway pipeline gets approval, this market could turn around in a flash."
There are now at least five office projects planned or under construction, including Brookfield Office Properties Inc.'s $1-billion-plus project called 225 Sixth, which could include the city's tallest building (Brookfield proposed a 56-storey or 247-metre-tall tower as well as another 42-storey building, and the project is scheduled to become home to tenants around 2017), and Palliser Towers, which could be ready around 2016.
Calgary surpassed Montreal in the first quarter of this year for total Class A office space, Mr. Bergevin said. And, across all classes, there is now 2.5 million square feet of office space under construction or about to break ground, and another 3.5 million proposed in the central area of Calgary, he added.
"In a market that moves in enormous blocks, that's not as daunting as it sounds."
Niall Collins, senior vice-president of development for Cadillac Fairview, said that even though some players are putting space up for sublet, other large energy firms are expanding.
"We're continuing to negotiate, we've got a couple of leases that we're negotiating right now," said Mr. Collins, referring to tenants for Cadillac's City Centre project.
Located at 2nd Street and 3rd Avenue SW, the City Centre mixed-use project will cover a full city block and include a 36-storey office tower that's now under construction with occupancy expected in early 2016. Seventeen per cent of the building is leased, and Mr. Collins said negotiations are under way for a "substantial portion" of the remainder.
Last September, when the market was still firing on all cylinders and had quickly become one of the most expensive in the country, Imperial Oil Ltd. said it would relocate its downtown offices to a complex in the southeast end of the city, and months later Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. said it would move some of its head office to property it owns in the city's Ogden rail yards.
With vacancy rates still low, prices remain solid.
"Imperial is moving out of town, but you've got a lot of larger companies that are eating up every square foot of space that becomes available," Mr. Collins said. "So the exit of CP and Imperial, I don't think it's leaving a void that will take long to fill."
"The lack of activity that we're seeing today is in my estimation in large part due to the lack of available space, or lack of available quality space," said Loy Sullivan, a vice-president at 20 Vic Management Inc., whose firm was involved in the leasing of Eighth Avenue Place West, which is scheduled to be ready for tenant fixturing in the first half of next year. "The bigger transactions, there's just nowhere for them to take place."
It will be some time yet before the projects under construction come on stream.
"In my view demand is just moderating," said David Routledge, vice-president of real estate management west at Oxford Properties Group, which announced this month that MEG Energy Corp. will occupy about 11 floors of its 25-storey Eau Claire Tower once it's built.
Mr. Routledge noted that MEG's growth is organic. "It's 300,000 feet of growth of that tenancy, so our view for 2013 would be that we're in for a period of more moderate growth but we do see a good outlook going forward." Andrew MacLachlan, a broker and executive vice-president at Jones Lang LaSalle Real Estate Services Inc., says, "most groups are taking a wait-and-see approach." But, he adds, "it's wait-and-see, but that's at the top of the market."
Jones Lang LaSalle publishes a property clock where 12:00 means the market's peaked and 6:00 means it's bottomed. Calgary's been hovering around 12:00 for more than three years now. Most of the local players suggest it will continue to do so for some time to come.
******************
DOWNTOWN VACANCY
As it stands, Calgary is the tightest major market in Canada.
3.8%
The current vacancy rate for all classes of buildings in downtown Calgary, compared with 7 per cent in Edmonton, 4.9 per cent in Vancouver, 4.6 per cent in Toronto and 6.6 per cent in Montreal.
3.3%
Calgary's office vacancy rate in the fourth quarter of last year. Even in a pessimistic scenario that takes into account new buildings coming on stream, Cushman & Wakefield Canada CEO Pierre Bergevin said that he doesn't see it going much higher than 5 per cent.

What They Got: Behind the entry gates of a 107-by97-foot lot is this sprawling 4,520-square-foot residence with a long driveway, double garage and secluded south-facing backyard and patio with a hot tub.
* In 2005, architect Brad Lamoureux remastered the 23-year-old structure with more open interiors that had hardwood floors, walls of windows and multiple glass doors to two angular decks. Large groups can be entertained in the dining area off the central kitchen and fireside living and family rooms.

Full text:   Soon, on a vacant lot next to the Disraeli Freeway in downtown Winnipeg, there will appear a flying saucer.
More precisely, it will be a building shaped like a flying saucer - round, 130 feet across, resting on thin stilts and containing two layers of pie-shaped condo apartments. It will be less strange than an alien spacecraft, but still plenty weird. It is the work of a local developer and the young professionals at 5468796 Architecture, and if you ask them, it's all quite sensible.
"We came about this in a very rational manner," says architect Ken Borton, who led the design for the project at 5468796. The site "is surrounded by undesireable things on all sides," he says - light industry, the highway, and the back of another apartment complex. That meant it would be a challenge to make it an attractive place for Winnipeg's young professionals to buy into. "We came to the conclusion that we had to push it up in the air." The residents of its 40 units will overlook the Red River or - peeking over the freeway - much of Winnipeg beyond. And all this for an entry-level price of less than $200,000 for a 600-square-foot apartment.
Does that make sense? This sort of skewed but undeniable logic has driven 5468796 and their partners to create a string of distinctive buildings in and around downtown Winnipeg. Working mostly on the margins of the city's real estate industry, the architects have designed and constructed buildings - from a glimmering park pavilion to a boldly sculptural office building and several innovative condo projects - that are consistently surprising and beautiful. In Montreal or Toronto, it would be an impressive body of work. But in Winnipeg? Where did that flying saucer come from?
Even the developer is not totally certain. "546 has the ability to convince me to do stuff that nobody else does," says Mark Penner, a thirty-something real estate agent, the head of Greenseed Development and the force behind this project. "I'm not totally sure how it came to be round. But they made a series of really good arguments. And if nobody gives us a good reason not to do something crazy, we stick with it."
This attitude has paid off for the designers, who two weeks ago added the Emerging Architectural Practice Award from the Royal Architectural Institute of Canada to their long list of awards. It has also paid off for Mr. Penner, who as a builder and a developer has found profit in remaking marginal and challenging bits of Winnipeg's urban fabric.
They previously collaborated on a "crazy" collection of apartments right next door to the 62M site - on a very long, narrow, awkward piece of land. Dubbed YouCube, that collection of 18 townhouses is a complex composition of cubes and rectangular forms, with a layered interior of two-, three- and four-level units. It won a series of design awards, and despite its unusual design and slightly marginal location, it sold. Mr. Penner was ready to go back and work next door - with more units, and without the headaches of building 18 different units.
Hence the idea for 62M's 40 pie-shaped apartments, all identical. Each one has a door at the tip of the pie slice, leading into an entryway with a laundry closet; a galley kitchen with an island; and then, at the widest part, facing the windows, either a separate bedroom with sliding wall panels or a home office space. Both configurations call for a Murphy bed that can fold up during the day, creating more living space. A triangle is not, it must be said, the most efficient form for an apartment, but these are extremely well-planned, and the form does provide benefits. Here is where the leaps of logic begin. One: affordability. The plan "allows for 40 identical suites, which means cheaper construction," Mr. Borton said, "because you don't get custom details at the corners of the building." Instead, the fabric of the building continues repetitively all the way around. This outside façade is not technically curved, but a series of many faceted flat windowpanes. Mr. Penner says it took a while to get a contractor to understand these details, but they are possible and affordable.
Two: the virtues of geometry. Within the building, there are likewise as few curves as possible - curves being equally inconvenient in interior layouts and construction. Only the glass wall is curved - which means a range of views and lots of daylight. "At the end of a pie-slice, you get the most light and the most surface area," Mr. Borton observes.
Three: the creation of an icon. This building will be as memorable as a Martian, and that is to its advantage, with more expensive condos right on the riverfront nearby being sold now as well. Though the downtown real estate market is improving, Mr. Penner puts it this way: "We're just starting to rebuild our downtown." In this context 62M has received local press, but Mr. Borton says it's also engendered much skepticism. "People's response is that there's no way this is going to get built in Winnipeg," he says. "There is caution ... It's going to be exciting when people realize this is going to be a real project and not just an idea somebody's throwing around."
With the building going into construction this spring, that day is coming. And now the architects and Mr. Penner are "really working hard to figure out the space underneath," Mr. Borton says. Parking is around the edges, leaving a circle nearly 100 feet in diameter as open space. They're working with landscape architects Atelier Anonymous on some interesting concepts, including a stand of jack pines to animate this space, whose purpose is still a bit uncertain. In the middle of this is the elevator lobby, which will be very tight - just eight feet across. They're studying hard how to make those spaces sing: to follow through on their logic down to the details of how they will be experienced by the people who live there. This is where good architects show their sense of responsibility and the fullness of their design vision, and 5468796 certainly do that.

LISTING AGENT
Ed Allan, Royal LePage West Realty Group Ltd.
The Action: Realtor Ed Allan has sold a couple of bungalows on a tree-lined street in Norseman Heights with his most recent transaction being this detached, brick bungalow with an attached garage.
More than 100 groups dropped by the open house and 60 ventured through at other times. Before the end of the week, five buyers battled to present the best bid, which was in the mid $500,000s.
What They Got: In the early 1950s, a 41-by-133-foot property became the home for this two-bedroom and one-bathroom bungalow with a living room, adjacent dining room and kitchen, in addition to a rear sunroom with a walkout and lower-level family room.
The Agent's Take: "It's a high demand area close to the QEW, Queensway theatre district, Sherway Gardens, two No Frills grocery stores and excellent schools," says Mr. Allan.
"It's close to two TTC buses - one to Royal York subway [station] and one to the Islington subway - and it's close to the Mimico GO station and the highway." This home was also fit to be occupied or torn down as the local buyers will do. "It's popular because older people can live in the house because everything's on one level and it's so close to stores that even if you lose your car, you can still get there," adds Mr. Allan.

Full text:   Attorney admits transaction that landed him in hot water was 'dishonest'
The northern B.C. community of Fort Nelson - population 3,900 - could be left without a lawyer after the only one in town was suspended by the Law Society of B.C. for four months for dishonesty.
The Society noted in a recent ruling that its decision against Nathan Bauder, "the only lawyer in town," could cause some hardship. "The public, including the citizens of Fort Nelson, need to be assured that they are protected from unscrupulous conduct, even if this results in the loss to them, temporarily, of their only local legal representation," the disciplinary panel concluded.
Mr. Bauder, who had political aspirations, will begin his suspension on July 27 and must pay a $10,000 penalty for falsifying his own mortgage documents by inflating the value of his home. Now 38, Mr. Bauder offered no excuse for his actions and admitted he was "the author of his own misfortune."
There has been other fallout: At least one bank now won't do mortgage business with him. He has lost friends, has been shunned by the legal community outside of Fort Nelson and has absented himself from community and provincial boards, the law society noted.
The Law Society heard how Mr. Bauder, a member of the Okanagan First Nation, grew up in Quesnel, put himself through Capilano University as a chainsaw salesman, attended the Northern Lights College satellite campus in Fort Nelson and the University of British Columbia law school, where he graduated in 2001.
He articled with a Prince George law firm before becoming a lawyer in 2002. He practised three years in Prince George before heeding the advice of an older lawyer to "head north" to Fort Nelson, which didn't have a lawyer.
The panel heard Mr. Bauder was overwhelmed when he moved to Fort Nelson in 2005. As the only lawyer in town, he was "shellshocked" by the number of cases coming his way - criminal, divorce, real estate and corporate transactions. In the area of real estate alone, he was handling up to 40 conveyances a month. Millions of dollars flowed through his trust account each year. And he was even handling the corporate work of companies owned by Fort Nelson's mayor, the disciplinary panel heard.
After three whirlwind years, the stress and pressure began taking its toll on his life.
Mr. Bauder's four-year marriage broke down in 2008. He sold the family home in Fort Nelson and rented a basement suite. He felt that it would be a prudent business move to purchase a home in Prince George, where he thought of relocating his practice.
Mr. Bauder ran afoul of the law society when he inflated the value of a property he was going to buy in an effort to gain financing. He prepared a false purchase contract with an increased purchase price and had the seller initial and sign the false document. In a hearing before the Law Society, Mr. Bauder acknowledged he knew it was "dishonest."
But he has continued to serve hundreds of people since his misconduct, which he maintains won't happen again.
At least one of his clients, the mayor of Fort Nelson, continues to support him, the Law Society noted in its decision. And the main real estate agent in Fort Nelson told the Law Society: "Nathan has been a pillar in our community outside of his practice as well. In most professions, mistakes are made and disciplines are handed down. I hope and ask that you allow Nathan to continue to practise as our community very much needs him."

Full text:   REAL ESTATE REPORTER
Ottawa's efforts to cool the housing market amid fears of rapid overheating in cities such as Toronto and Vancouver are causing steep sales declines in areas that had been relatively healthy, economists say.
The number of homes that changed hands in the Halifax-Dartmouth area during March was 36-per-cent lower than a year ago, sales in Sudbury fell 33.5 per cent, in downward pressure on savings accounts is starting to lift and in Regina 23.5 per cent.
"The government's focus was on Toronto and Vancouver, and I would call it the unintended consequences," said Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce economist Benjamin Tal. "Cities like Winnipeg and Halifax are feeling the same pain, although they didn't need to feel the same pain, and the eventual slowdown will be more than optimal."
Finance Minister Jim Flaherty changed the country's mortgage insurance rules last July, in an effort to stem the speedy rise of consumer debt levels and house prices, citing in particular concerns about pockets such as Toronto's condo market. The changes included cutting the maximum length of an insured mortgage to 25 years from 30, and putting a halt to government-backed insurance for homes worth more than $1-million. While the latter move had a greater impact in Toronto and Vancouver, the change in amortization length had an impact on first-time buyers across the country.
"A lot of the cities that had been much better behaved in terms of pricing and overall activity have been hit as hard as Vancouver and Toronto," said Bank of Montreal economist Douglas Porter. "Some cities are really taking it on the chin."
On Monday, the Canadian Real Estate Association reported that sales of existing homes nationwide were 15.3-per-cent lower in March than a year ago. The MLS Home Price Index rose just 2.2 per cent in March, its smallest gain in over two years, said CREA, which represents the nation's realtors.
More than 90 per cent of the local markets that it obtains data from posted year-over-year sales declines, while Edmonton once again showed an increase.
Economists generally estimate that national home prices are overvalued by as much as 10 to 20 per cent, but estimates have been heavily skewed by Toronto and Vancouver (even though prices in Vancouver have come down). "One of the challenges with mortgage regulations is that they are blanket policy instruments, so they affect everybody," said Toronto-Dominion Bank economist Sonya Gulati.
Mr. Porter points to the sales decline in Winnipeg as particularly noteworthy. "Among the major cities, it's got basically the lowest prices in the country," he said. "I think by most metrics you wouldn't consider Winnipeg to be overvalued."
Winnipeg realtor Cliff King, at Re/Max Executives Realty, said sales in the city are spotty now. "Markets are so different and I think that was totally uncalled for," he said of the mortgage insurance rule changes. "It definitely had a huge impact and they should have had a program that was customized to parts of Canada that required it."
Mr. Porter said it will be a few years before it's clear whether Mr. Flaherty took precisely the right steps or not. "I believe there was broad agreement that something was needed to at least partially cool down the market," he said.
Mr. Tal noted that changing mortgage insurance rules is a relatively precise tool compared to an interest rate increase by the Bank of Canada, which would have cooled the housing market by pushing mortgage rates up but also would have affected sectors other than real estate.
"If you look at the overall situation, I think that Finance must be pleased by what they're seeing today," Mr. Tal added. "I don't think they see the slowdown as excessive, I think it is exactly what they had in mind."

CO-OP AGENT
Nicolas Blachette, Sutton West Coast Realty
The action: Early this year, clients of agent Nicolas Blachette yearned to buy a residence in a heritage building in Gastown, but only four one-bedroom lofts fell within their $500,000 budget between 15 conversion projects.
This one-bedroom, corner loft in the Alexis and Alexander complex near Maple Tree Square already had an offer, but the deal fall apart and the price was reduced to $399,900. So Mr. Blachette's clients wrote an offer after a tour that same day.
What they got: A turn-of-the-century structure once at the city's centre of trade and commerce was converted into a condominium residence comprised of fewer than 60 units in 1997.
* This 700-square-foot loft features 9.5-foot ceilings and exposed brick walls in the master bedroom and an open entertaining area with a gas fireplace, hardwood floors, south-facing windows and double glass balcony doors.
* Wet stations are located along the entry hall, including a linear kitchen, laundry closet and four-piece bathroom.
* Monthly fees of $252 pay for upkeep of a rooftop patio, bike storage area and garage where this unit has parking.
The agent's take: "The unit is an end unit and features brick walls, high ceilings, a small Juliet balcony with French doors, a large open layout and a private parking spot on-site, which is super rare for the area," Mr. Blachette states.
"It is very unique as it is looking directly onto 'Gassy Jack' square, the open air stage for the International Jazz Festival, which is the biggest summer, cultural celebration in the city."
Buyers also fancied local year-round attractions. "Gastown is becoming the trendiest area of downtown Vancouver with some of the best bars and restaurants of the city to go out, a good concert and nightclub scene, and many independent art galleries, stylish coffee shops and fashion boutiques bordering the streets," says Mr. Blachette.

Five-star Muay Thai? Only in Bangkok

Abstract: If there's another five-star property with a genuine Muay Thai fighting ring I'll eat my gold-satin boxing shorts. Muay Thai - "the art of eight limbs" - isn't just a potentially lethal combat that involves punches, kicks, elbow and knee strikes, but is also a wicked way of staying in great shape. Trained professionals offer private lessons as well as trips to a Muay Thai training centre and tickets to a professional fight.

Full text:   Bangkok's newest luxury resort hotel, the Siam, is family owned, which, until you meet the family, makes it sound all cozy and sweet. But the Sukosols are Thailand's answer to the Rockefellers and the Redgraves rolled into one - their wealth is in real estate, show business and hotels.
Matriarch Kamala is CEO, but also a renowned jazz singer - her deadly accurate imitation of Shirley Bassey belting Goldfinger at the Oscars is legendary here. Her alt-rock singer and Thai movie-star son, Krissada, acted as creative director for this $40-million "urban resort" on the banks of the Chao Phraya river.
Kamala used paleolithic terracotta bowls and fine Chinese porcelain from her own collection along with Krissada's superb gathering of Thai memorabilia to decorate the Siam's corridors and 39 suites and villas (there's nothing so mundane as a room at this hotel).
Location, location
The Siam is the only five-star hotel in Bangkok's elegant and leafy Dusit district, the perfect antidote to the hurly-burly of the rest of town. Dusit is a tranquil refuge studded with the mansions and palaces of Bangkok's rich and royal. You can't toss a diadem without hitting a royal residence - the Crown Prince's palace and the magnificent Vimanmek Teak Mansion, one-time residence of King Rama V (1853-1910), are just up the road.
If I could change one thing
The trouble with a refuge is that sometimes you long to get out and back to the hurly-burly. The Siam's pretty far from Bangkok action central, although the complimentary river shuttle will take you there in less than a half hour.
Design
The Siam is a palace, subtly magnificent and surprisingly light on its feet. The moment you enter its glassy coolness, you know you're in a world apart. The main residence, where the suites are located, is modelled on Paris's glass-roofed Musee d'Orsay, with a sun-washed atrium enclosing a fountain the size of a soccer pitch. The suites, villas and public rooms are art-deco inspired, with a black-and-white palette enlivened by touches of plum and pale green and by the original sculptures scattered about.
My river-view suite featured 4.5-metre ceilings, a spectacular panorama of the busy Chao Phraya river, an oval alabaster soaking tub the size of a Cunard liner, a soignee sitting room with a plum-upholstered loveseat and a dramatic black floor. Did I mention the butler? His name was Aon and was as charming as he was efficient.
Best amenity
If there's another five-star property with a genuine Muay Thai fighting ring I'll eat my gold-satin boxing shorts. Muay Thai - "the art of eight limbs" - isn't just a potentially lethal combat that involves punches, kicks, elbow and knee strikes, but is also a wicked way of staying in great shape. Trained professionals offer private lessons as well as trips to a Muay Thai training centre and tickets to a professional fight. I'm sure the Siam bartender wouldn't mind running up a Thermos full of real Muay Thai - dark rum, coconut, vodka, vanilla, lemon juice and green tea - for that important after-match recovery period.
Eat in or Out?
Chon (Thai for "spoon") is the hotel restaurant located in a trio of traditional teak-wood houses that once belonged to a high-society local, who entertained everyone from Henry Ford to Jacqueline Kennedy and, legend has it, was also a secret agent. Chon specializes in the delicate flavours of northern Thai cuisine - the blissful smile on the reclining Buddha in the restaurant's vestibule suggests he ate there.
Whom you'll meet
Arty and showbiz friends of the Sukosol family stopping by for cocktails and amuse-bouches on the Siam's private pier. Also, cabinet ministers, foreign ambassadors, well-heeled remittance men and ne'er-do-well second sons down to their last $50-million.
The Siam, 3/2 Thanon Khao, Bangkok, Thailand, thesiamhotel.com. 39 suites and villas starting at $572.

Like homeowners tending to their gardens at the first sign of spring, Carlyle Communities is busy cultivating an infill site in the Upper Beaches community for a fresh, new building to pop up.
Situated on the crest of a hill at the southeast corner of Gerrard Street East and Woodbine Avenue, the seven-storey condominium will have an exterior finished in bright green, white and black accents.
"Buyers have been very receptive to the project from many levels," says Naram Mansour, president of Carlyle Communities, which sold half the 64 units available since October.
"They definitely love the design of the project, which they feel is very refreshing ... and very appropriate for the neighbourhood."
The boutique development will be one of only a few mid-rise buildings in the revitalizing Woodbine Avenue corridor.
"This is going to be unique relative to architecture of the area because we're using quite bright and light colours. We want to instill a sense of optimism in the area," says Roland Rom Colthoff, who is the director of architectural firm, RAW Design.
"The area has more traditional, darker conservative brick colours ... and a lot of buildings around town are all window wall systems and use more conservative blue and grey tones."
The project's colour palette also alludes to its use of eco-friendly building practices and features, such as green roofs and a sleek façade with nearly an equal amount of glass cladding and fibre-reinforced cement panels to cut down utility costs.
"The heat retention and cool air retention is significantly higher than pure glass towers," says Mr. Mansour. "The green and white panels allow for better heat retention in the winter and keeps the building cooler in the summer."
Paints with low volatile organic compounds and sustainably harvested wood cabinetry and floors will also be among standard finishes in each suite, which range from studios to two-bedroom plans.
"There's something for everybody," Mr. Colthoff states. "[Also] we did combine units into large two-bedroom units."
Locals homeowners downsizing also appreciate how the principal rooms open up to private balconies, including a 831-square-foot wraparound terrace for a 792-square-foot penthouse.
"Our penthouse suites have been very popular because the terraces are just massive," says Mr. Mansour. "It's very enticing for people, especially people in this neigbourhood who are very outdoorsy and like to be out and about."
Providing only a gym, third-floor party room and terrace on site - as well as some ground-floor retail - was another way to encourage residents to be active in the community.
"If you want to work out, go to a yoga or Pilates studio five steps away, or if you want to hold a condo board meeting maybe hold it at a restaurant, pub or coffee shop," Mr. Mansour states.
"It's attractive for everyone who loves the Beach, so if you're someone who loves to play volleyball Saturdays and Sundays ... it's a five-to-10-minute bike ride or a 15 to 20 minute walk."
Many buyers have forgone the $29,900 spot in a parking stacker since there are three major forms of transit nearby.
"We're probably the most convenient transit-oriented project in the neighbourhood," adds Mr. Mansour. "The Gerrard streetcar is literally on the doorstep of the building; the Woodbine subway station on the Bloor/Danforth line is about a 10-minute walk at most; and there's a GO stop at Gerrard and Main."
Monthly fees will be about 55 cents a square foot and occupancy begins early 2015.

Abstract: Some business owners are ardent defenders of the practice. Paul Vickers, owner of four restaurants and a casino in Calgary, argues the food service business needs reliable people, regardless of where they come from. "You pay them and they show up for work," he said of temporary foreign workers. He said he has hired small numbers of workers, mostly from the Philippines, to work as chefs and dishwashers and pays them the same or more as his other workers.

Full text:   The 33,000 companies and agencies who have applied to the federal temporary foreign worker program in Canada stretch to almost every corner of the economy, ranging from the biggest players in the finance and resource sectors to airlines, hotels, government agencies, and the Canadian Broadcasting Corp., according to documents obtained by The Globe and Mail.
The lengthy list of companies and groups, obtained through federal Access to Information laws, spans 475 pages and demonstrates how widely used the federal program has become since it was expanded in 2006 to help Canadian employers deal with shortages of specialized skills in Canada.
In recent days, the program has come under the microscope after a Royal Bank of Canada employee alleged the bank was using temporary foreign workers to do the work of bank staff. The bank denies any violation of federal rules, saying it is outsourcing work to another company. It issued an apology Thursday over its handling of the matter.
But the list of companies using temporary foreign workers is massive, part of the reason the program has tripled to 338,189 workers in the last decade. Though the list of companies gives no indication of how many foreign workers each firm sought to hire, the documents reflect all applications made to Ottawa over a two-year period ending in June, 2012. Inclusion on the list implies no wrongdoing, but is merely a window into how widespread the practice of using temporary foreign workers has become.
In addition to Canada's big banks, who are users of the program primarily for technology jobs such as software development, the roster also includes major car makers, universities, mining companies, technology firms, film production companies and a host of other sectors.
The country's biggest telecom firms also employ temporary foreign workers, including Bell, Rogers Communications, Telus, and Shaw Communications. The food services industry is also a major player on the list. Well known names like Tim Hortons, which has been hiring temporary foreign workers since 2005, figure prominently in several provinces.
"Our owners turn to the temporary foreign worker program after they have exhausted all other avenues to fill job vacancies locally," said Alexandra Cygal, Tim Hortons' spokeswoman. "Without the employment program, many Tim Hortons restaurants would not be able to operate full time or, in many cases, remain open at all."
To use the program, companies must prove they can't find the skills they need in the local market. Dozens of government organizations use the program including Health Canada and the Bank of Canada. The central bank hired 18 temporary foreign workers in 2012 for senior analyst positions, including 15 foreign PhD candidates. Provincial and municipal governments from across the country are also keen users of the program, according to the list.
Prime Minister Stephen Harper said Thursday he is concerned about the extent the program is now being used and that it was only intended for "absolute and acute" skill shortages.
Several unexpected names show up on the list, including charities, church groups, and non-profit organizations such as the Girl Guides of Canada, which said it sought clearance to bring in an international camp counsellor for a summer program. Colleges and universities also use the program for specialists. Edmonton-based Guru Digital Arts College said it applied to the program to hire Nat Jones, considered a "legendary zombie guy" in the comic book world. Mr. Jones helped create an illustration program at the school. "There's not a lot of comic book, legendary zombie illustrators in Canada," college director Owen Brierley said. "It's nice to have a reverse brain drain for once."
The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation is also a user of the program, as are other broadcasters. A spokesman for the CBC said the broadcaster used the program six times last year: Hockey Night in Canada hired three hockey personalities under the temporary foreign worker program, while the public broadcaster also brought in three specialized equipment operators from the U.S. for its broadcast of the Canadian Country Music Awards.
The Globe and Mail employs four people on the program who are editorial employees that bring specialized graphics, production and international expertise, publisher Phillip Crawley said. "The Globe has made use of this program for many years when we have needed to bring in talent not available in Canada," Mr. Crawley said. "We are competing for the best people internationally, so for a handful of jobs, this is an appropriate solution."
In the airline sector, the use of temporary foreign workers has become a divisive topic. CanJet Airlines used the program to bring in about 30 seasonal foreign pilots this winter. It needs them given the seasonality of its business and the large expense it would incur in training Canadian pilots with experience in smaller aircraft, said Stephen Rowe, president of the Nova Scotia-based firm. It's hard to find Canadians willing to work a 4.5-month stint and who are qualified, he says, so that if the program were scrapped, "we would really have to look at the business to see if it makes sense," he said. "And if it didn't make sense, we'd be out of the charter business. And there are 700 jobs that would be gone with it."
Rival carrier Sunwing made two applications for temporary foreign pilots last fall, for 60 and 59 pilots, respectively, according to the Air Line Pilots Association, which obtained documents relating to those applications through access to information. That touches a nerve with many out-of-work pilots, such as Steve Zago, a 14-year veteran. He and about 60 other pilots were laid off at Transat A.T. last October. All of them were qualified airline pilots, he said, so they applied to open positions at both Sunwing and CanJet, but did not get a response.
Montreal-based Transat complained to the federal government that rivals such as Sunwing are using seasonal workers at a much lower cost. Transat says its workforce is Canadian, but could be forced to resort to foreign pilots in the future given the competitive pressure. "Of course, we will adapt our model to the new reality. It's important for us, for business and competitive reasons," said spokesman Pierre Tessier.
The blistering debate is making Mr. Rowe, at CanJet, rethink his hiring practices. Next month, he said, he will change the qualifications listed on job postings to ensure Canadian pilots with big-jet operator experience are eligible. "It's becoming a sensitive issue," he said.
Some business owners are ardent defenders of the practice. Paul Vickers, owner of four restaurants and a casino in Calgary, argues the food service business needs reliable people, regardless of where they come from. "You pay them and they show up for work," he said of temporary foreign workers. He said he has hired small numbers of workers, mostly from the Philippines, to work as chefs and dishwashers and pays them the same or more as his other workers. He has resorted to the program because of what Mr. Vickers calls a "disturbing trend" in hiring local workers who sometimes don't show up. "You fire him, and he doesn't even think of it, he just goes onto the next job," he said.
Not all business owners are fans of the program though. Roxanne Jones, manager of the Toddle Inn Day Care in Strathmore, Alta., just east of Calgary, said she is constantly looking for qualified staff. But after bringing in a temporary foreign worker from the U.S. two years ago who did not work out, and footing the associated extra costs of the program, she wouldn't do it again, "Unless I had to," Ms. Jones said, adding the program "is just all kinds of paperwork."
****************
338, 189
The number of temporary foreign workers in Canada on Dec. 1, 2012.
Each year on Dec. 1, the Canadian government does a count of how many TFWs there are in the country -
2012's number is still considered preliminary.
What they are doing in Canada
There are different ways temporary foreign workers can enter the country, but the vast majority - more than 202,000 in 2012 - enter via
Human Resources and Skills Development Canada's "positive labour market opinions," which are approvals after an employer shows it needs
a foreign worker to fill a job and that no Canadian worker was available. HRSDC keeps a number of statistics of these temporary foreign workers, including their skill level and the industry sectors for which they work.
140,668
The number of temporary foreign workers in Canada on Dec. 1, 2005,

Abstract: Meanwhile, owners of ex-council flats continue to reap big profits. Many of the tenants sold their properties to investors or property companies, which were able to jack up the rents in a tight market. Last month, the Daily Mirror reported that Charles Gow, the son of Mrs. [Margaret Thatcher]'s housing minister, Ian Gow, bought 40 of the 120 former council flats in one housing project in Roehampton, in South West London.

Full text:   1980 scheme to sell off public housing at discount prices not matched by construction of new public housing
Like many Britons, Jeffery Davies had a love-hate relationship with former prime minister Margaret Thatcher, who died on Monday. A former coal miner, he hated her union-busting agenda.
But he loved her for the windfall profit he made on his council flat in Rotherham, an old coal and steel town in central England. Mr. Davies, 70, bought the small flat for a mere £3,000 - less than the price of a car - shortly after Lady Thatcher unveiled her "Right to Buy" scheme for public-housing tenants in 1980. In 2000, he sold the flat for £60,000 and wishes he had hung on, because property prices have soared since then. "Still, it was a great investment," he says.
The selloff of council housing is one of the defining, and certainly most enduring, economic and social policies of Lady Thatcher, who was premier from 1979 to 1990. She launched the council-house selloff not just because public housing clashed with her free-market principles, but because she was keen to neuter the local council authorities, most of which she considered bastions of socialism.
Today, council-housing tenants still have the right to buy flats or houses (though the purchase conditions have been substantially tightened).
The housing selloff at deep discount prices, combined with one of the longest house-price rallies in European history, triggered the cult of home equity and earned small fortunes for millions of tenants who had the wisdom and wherewithal to buy.
But three decades after the program was launched, its success is being re-evaluated. Some economists, politicians and housing experts think Right to Buy has created as many problems - perhaps more - than it solved. That's because the selloff of public housing was not matched with construction of new public housing. The result? A chronic shortage of affordable housing in a country where home prices are painfully high by European standards.
"There is a real housing problem here and it won't go away any time soon," said Rebecca Tunstall, professor of housing policy at the University of York. "There has been a drastic reduction in available social housing."
Tenants jumped at the right to buy their flats and houses, which came as no surprise, given the discounts offered. Discounts to market value started at 44 per cent for flats and 32 per cent for houses and went up from there, depending on how long the tenants had lived in the homes.
Between 1980 and 2010, about 21/2 million properties were sold, equivalent to about half of the country's stock of public housing. Home-ownership rates went from about 57 per cent to almost 70 per cent as a result.
The profits made by the tenants who sold their properties were lavish in many cases. Gary Mason, branch manager of the Martyn Gerrard real-estate office in Kentish Town, in north London, said he remembers tenants buying local-area, one-bedroom council flats for about £50,000 in the early 1990s.
Today, those same flats are going for £250,000 or more. "People realized they would be silly not to take advantage of the discounts," he said.
That was the good news; the bad news was that the local authorities stopped building council properties, in good part because they had almost no ability to borrow money to fund new developments. As a result, public - that is, cheap, housing - is in exceedingly short supply in Britain. About five million people are on the social-housing waiting list.
Meanwhile, owners of ex-council flats continue to reap big profits. Many of the tenants sold their properties to investors or property companies, which were able to jack up the rents in a tight market. Last month, the Daily Mirror reported that Charles Gow, the son of Mrs. Thatcher's housing minister, Ian Gow, bought 40 of the 120 former council flats in one housing project in Roehampton, in South West London. Rents for the former council flats have soared, leaving some low-income tenants begging for higher rental subsidies. "Speculators have made millions out of exploiting public assets," Tony Belton, a Labour councillor in South West London, told the Mirror. "It stinks."
Prof. Tunstall said that neither the government of Prime Minister David Cameron nor the local authorities have any credible solution to the low-cost housing shortage, and the shortage is getting worse. "It's one of the top policy issues here," she said. "We're only getting a trickle of new housing."

Personally, I don't see why the federal cabinet can't be replaced by cheaper foreign workers.
What's the big deal? At the top, you need somebody with an economics degree and some experience running a small office. Our Glorious Leader has such a degree and ran the National Citizens Coalition, a tiny operation with few employees. That's it. Surely there's somebody with similar qualifications who is willing to come here and do the job for a fraction of the cost?
After that, for the rest of cabinet, you need some lawyers, maybe somebody with medical experience, some real-estate agents and people who can say "prudent management of the economy" over and over with a straight face. Also, somebody with a knack for attack ads. It can't be hard to find foreign workers with such skills. And willing to do it for half the salary of those currently occupying cabinet posts. I'd call the idea "prudent management."
Nobody mentioned the idea in the TV news coverage about RBC replacing Canadian staff with temporary foreign workers employed by an outside firm. The story is one of those instances that makes a person think - specifically, think those who work in the TV news racket are a bit dim. We've been told that Canadians are "outraged" over the RBC actions and yet what we see on TV is mostly a matter of tiptoeing around bank officials. As if the banks must be treated with enormous deference, no matter how outrageous their business practices.
The other night on CBC's The National the top fella at RBC talked about the temporary foreign workers thing. Before viewers got to hear his views, Pastor Mansbridge interviewed Amanda Lang about what the fella said. It was comical. You'd think Lang had interviewed the Pope and had to preface the interview with an explanation of the arcane religious matters that might come up in the interview and confuse viewers. Eventually, the RBC fella appeared and insulted the nation's intelligence, using the phrase, "We benchmark extremely well ..."
That too was comical. It's a fact that the news on TV is often more hysterically funny than most sitcoms. Depending on your point of view, of course. I mean comical in the sense of anger, rage and bafflement at the inanity of the news presentation.
Daily, Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert feed off this kind of comedic anger, rage and bafflement. To the point where many people feel they haven't absorbed the day's news until they've witnessed the comedy angle to it all. Hereabouts, we go in for a much milder version of that approach and we have much less of it. So if you're thinking that This Hour Has 22 Minutes is going to take a break from Don Cherry jokes to tackle the banks and foreign workers issue, you're wrong. The 22 Minutes season is already over.
Which brings us to sitcoms. How to Live With Your Parents (for the Rest of Your Life) (ABC, CITY-TV, 8:30 p.m.) arrived last week, a late entry into the mid-season battle for viewers. It's an interesting failure, this one.
The gist is this - Canadian Sarah Chalke plays Polly, a recently divorced single mother with a young daughter, Natalie (Rachel Eggleston). Polly is obliged to move back in with her parents Elaine (Elizabeth Perkins) and Max (Brad Garrett) because of what the E! channel tends to call "the sucky economy." Thus, Polly is obliged to deal with her wacky parents, raise her daughter, make nice with her ex Julian (Canadian Jon Dore) and, of course, get back into the dating world. Laughter ensues, the show promises.
It doesn't. The jokes are obvious and broad. What's especially interesting is how the excellent premise is twisted to put huge emphasis on Polly's mom and dad. Elaine and Max are presented as the truly interesting characters because they are free spirits, sexually active and kooky. There is a ton of room for mordant humour about the adult daughter pout in the humiliating situation of living with her parents again. And yet the audience has the way-out, middle-aged parents shoved down their throats. As we're told too often, "60 is the new 30."
It's another instance of a fictional sitcom failing to rise to the occasion. The real situation of people moving back to live with their parents is rife with comic possibilities, in a darkly humorous way. But as this poor effort tells us, you're better off trying to get your laughs from the news on TV.

Full text:   First Capital's CEO, who lives in Liberty Village, says the development would kill a neighbourhood he has watched mature
It's been a decade since First Capital Realty's CEO Dori Segal moved his head office from a Bay Street skyscraper to the nascent neighbourhood of Liberty Village in the city's west end. Now the shopping centre landlord is the latest real estate executive to speak out against plans for a Toronto casino, saying it will kill the community he has watched grow over the past 10 years and jeopardize further investment by his firm in the area.
Mr. Segal plans to deliver that message directly to Mayor Rob Ford and his executive committee next Monday. He is one of what is expected to be a long list of deputants who will speak over the course of the two-day meeting. The issue of a downtown casino provokes strong opinions on both sides. It cuts across the traditional left-right divide on council, with some councillors who traditionally support the mayor's agenda, such as Denzil Minnan-Wong and John Parker, opposing a new downtown facility. Unions also are lining up on both sides and citizens' groups and religious leaders have expressed their opposition to the province's plans to expand gambling.
City Manager Joe Pennachetti, in releasing his report on a city casino this week, said the level of public interest in the debate is some of the highest he has ever seen. "I get how divisive this issue is," he said. "I get that a lot of people may not even care about the dollars, they are totally against a casino. I get that."
Mr. Segal said he decided to voice his opposition - joining local business associations and other real estate companies such as RioCan - out of interest for his firm, but added that he has strong feelings about what a casino development might do to the city he and his wife chose to make their home 15 years ago because it was a good place to raise a family. He said he would voice the same concern if a casino were proposed in any of the neighbourhoods across the GTA where his firm owns property.
Sitting in a coffee shop in Liberty Village, Mr. Segal pointed to two mothers with strollers - evidence, he said, of how the condo development has transformed from a neighbourhood of singles, to couples, to young families.
"I'm trying to talk to everybody in the city who is willing to listen," explained Mr. Segal, who said fighting the casino has become a second job. In the days leading up to next week's meeting, he plans to continue to contact city politicians and local MPPs, and his firm has produced a video and posted it on YouTube to get its message out.
Mr. Segal thumbed a highlighted copying of the city manager's casino report, reading out staff findings that conclude the kind of massive casino complex contemplated by the province's gaming agency and casino operators for Toronto would be "difficult to integrate into the dense, urban fabric of downtown."
"We unequivocally don't believe a casino belongs in a neighbourhood and we don't think people want to live next to a casino," Mr. Segal said.
If a casino goes ahead at Exhibition Place, he said his firm, the largest landlord in the area with $200-million in holdings, will have to reconsider plans to invest another $250-million in retail and residential development.
City council needs to think hard about this decision, he said, adding, "If this is a mistake, it is going to take decades to correct it."

Full text:   Though locals still worry that big business will ruin the area's flavour, young food entrepreneurs are quietly adding new ingredients
On a graffiti-covered wall in the scrappiest neighbourhood in Toronto's core, a poster has been hung that reads: Wanted: Phil Pick for Killing Kensington Market.
It's the handiwork of Friends of Kensington Market, a local group of residents who have a bone to pick with the real estate agent who, they say, is threatening a landmark, Casa Acoreana, by jacking its rent. Shop windows are covered with "No Loblaws No" signs, protesting the possibility that the grocery chain is going to move onto College Street.
"Save Kensington" types have never been shy to raise their voices. And once again, market protectionists are sounding the alarm, arguing that the market of old - once known as the Jewish market in the early 20th century, when shoppers shared the streets with live chickens and goats - may lose its feisty, independent identity.
But is it really time to panic?
The new generation of green grocers, fishmongers and butcher shops say no. It's true that national chains like Starbucks (Mr. Pick was vilified in 2008 for suggesting it as a tenant) have attempted to make headway here. But they've always been deterred - partly because the tight streets, limited parking, spotty garbage removal, and tiny buildings in need of extensive repair have kept them out.
Meanwhile, a new brand of shopkeeper is quietly transforming the place: opening stores that cater to a new, more upscale clientele, while paying homage to the market's unruly spirit.
Walk down Baldwin Street, and you'll find a lineup outside Sanagan's Meat Locker, which replaced the longstanding European Meats, and specializes in hormone-free meats from local farmers. A stone's throw away is a fishmonger, Hooked, which sells ethically sourced, sustainable fish. Other popular newcomers include Hogtown Charcuterie (Polish-style terrines and smoked meats), Thomas Lavers Cannery and Deli (homemade jams, jellies and fresh pastas) and Jimmy's Coffee, which replaced the infamous Hot Box Cafe.
"Is Kensington changing? Definitely," says Pete Sanagan, a former chef and owner of the butcher's shop that bears his name. "But I don't think it's changing as an integral, vibrant food market in the city... It's just that newer customers and newer owners are coming in, which is the natural evolution of any neighbourhood."
Mika Bareket, owner of the cookbook store Good Egg, says Kensington's gentrification is a good thing - as long as it stays true to the neighbourhood's roots. "I've been here five years, and every year my business goes up," says Ms. Bareket, 40, who named her store in tribute to the market's once-thriving egg sellers. "It's inevitable we'll be surrounded by the Starbucks and Shoppers Drug Marts coming into the vicinity. But I don't believe Kensington will be overrun by them," adds Ms. Bareket, who has lived in Kensington her whole life. "There are too many of us who will fight tooth and nail to keep the independent spirit and the vibe. We're just trying to add a bit of spit and polish."
Hooked's owner Dan Donovan says Kensington will thrive and survive because its infrastructure works well for smaller businesses - not supersized ones. "The area's just not built for an 18-wheeler pulling up and delivering forklifts of products," he says. "The history of Kensington Market is that it's always been in the hands of small businesses and entrepreneurs," Mr. Donovan says. "That remains intact."
It's true that mom-and-pop shops are disappearing. But still, there are record stores, skateboard and longboard outlets, and organic emporiums like Tutti Frutti and Essence of Life that offer a selection of natural beauty products that rival anything at Whole Foods (and are substantially cheaper). These stores are attracting young, hip urbanites from across the city.
Susannah Bunce, an assistant professor at the University of Toronto Scarborough's department of urban geography, says the area's eclectic charm is not likely to face a major threat from large-scale retailers. "I don't think big box would ever come to Kensington because of what they'd have to do in terms of redevelopment," says Prof. Bunce, who worked on a revitalization plan for Kensington in the mid-1990s. "It's much easier to build a big box store on a parking lot or a gas station lot than to knock down a bunch of buildings in a really dense neighbourhood." And even parking lots around here are not easy targets. An attempt last year from retail landlord RioCan to build a 125,000-square-foot development nearby on Bathurst Street faced strong opposition from neighbourhood groups, and was rejected by the city.
Meanwhile, Friends of Kensington Market have gathered on weekends to protest Loblaws, asking pedestrians to sign petitions. Friends supporter Dominique Russell says a new location of the grocery chain, slated for the base of a new condo building on College Street, would be too close. "The backbone of the market has always been raw food sellers, whose profit margins are very thin," says Ms. Russell. "Given Loblaws' size, they can compete in a way that could destroy many of the smaller, family-owned businesses."
However, change continues, on a smaller scale. Mr. Sanagan points out that even some old-time fishmongers and cheesemongers, like Sea King and Global Cheese, have renovated to move with the times. "Some of the older generation is also keeping it fresh and current. It's definitely not an us-versus-them thing."
The uproar over a rent hike at the beloved Casa Acoreana, which has been in Ossie Pavao's family for more than 50 years, has once again pitted the tight-knit community against Mr. Pick, who represents several major landlords in the area - and isn't a Kensington resident himself. Mr. Pavao's fans have lit up Facebook and Twitter with protests.
Mr. Pick knows he's at the top of Kensington's most-wanted list, but he says after 10 years leasing property in the neighbourhood, he's developed a thick skin. "I'm not insecure," he says. "People are entitled to their opinion. But Kensington Market is in the heart of downtown Toronto, and it's improving, not dying. Rent hikes are a function of supply and demand. We're not gouging. We're talking fair market value."
Mr. Sanagan empathizes with the small family businesses that have been hurt by higher rents. "I'm lucky my shop is successful, but if I suddenly had to pay 150 per cent more, I wouldn't be very successful either," adds the butcher, who pays less than $60 a square foot for his space. Some Kensington landlords are rumoured to be asking $60 to $90 a square foot.
Mr. Sanagan says he has no issue with the agent whose face is plastered everywhere. "[Mr. Pick is] a real estate agent doing his job, and his job is to get the most money for his landlord. Do I agree with what some of the landlords are asking for? No. This isn't Yonge Street or Yorkville. But the area is on the rise."
One trend that disturbs Good Egg's Ms. Bareket is the increasing number of bars and restaurants flooding into the area. Ms. Bareket says they aren't as stable - often turning over every couple of years. Ms. Russell says the clubs are a worry because they could change Kensington from a booming daytime market to a raucous nighttime one.
Last week, behind the long wooden counter at Casa Acoreana, the 55-year-old Mr. Pavao says he's still in the dark about whether his building has been leased. But he has no plans to leave Kensington; in the worst case, he'll relocate in the market or nearby. "I'm already serving four generations, and I figure I've got 30 years left in me," he says.
Then he points to a sign hanging on his coffee grinder that carries a very Kensington sentiment: "Moderation has its place and it's not here."

Full text:   After almost 80 years, parcels of virgin sod almost twice the size of PEI are leaving federal protection. If nothing else, writes naturalist Trevor Herriot, the bitter genesis of these renowned community pastures 'should give us pause as we decide how to treat the land our dust-bowl forebears learned was best left to grow grass'
In the next few weeks, if the deep snows of this winter ever recede, prairie dwellers such as Georgiaday Hall may find themselves enacting a common rite of spring. Strolling through a hilltop scrap of native grass, they may stop above the first velvety crocus blooms emerging from the earth and crouch in wonderment, even gratitude. Despite all forces aligned against it, a piece of old prairie sod is coming to life again as it has for 7,000 years.
The crocuses, moss phlox and other spring flowers stir memories of Ms. Hall's grandfather, who arrived with his four small children 100 years ago this summer. Advertisements placed by the new Dominion of Canada in British papers had said there was fertile land for the taking on the virgin prairies of Saskatchewan, where grain flourished even in the driest regions.
Unable to resist, the recently widowed greengrocer in a Derbyshire coal town took up a piece of that promised land southwest of Swift Current on the edge of the Great Sand Hills, planting his first crop in 1915 in some of the province's poorest soils.
They got by, but when the Dust Bowl drought hit in the 1930s, Ms. Hall says, the government moved the family and its neighbours off the land. Their homesteads had been deemed unfit for farming and were to become part of a large communal pasture under a new federal program.
Created in April, 1935, that program, the Regina-based Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration (PFRA), set about stopping the erosion before it turned the southern Prairies into a desert. Once the soil was stabilized and the emergency over, its mandate shifted to managing the pastures, to provide grazing for local cattlemen while conserving soil, waterways and prairie ecosystems.
Last November, when Ms. Hall sent me her family's sad narrative - withered crops, blowing soil, children scattered, her 12-year old father labouring for one abusive farmer after another - she was worried about those pastures. She wrote to me because I was worried too. I keep a blog that focuses on the birds and natural history of the Great Plains. These days, however, almost every post tries to shed some light on the legacy of the PFRA, which, like many other federal environmental programs, fell under the shadow of Bill C-38, the 452-page omnibus budget bill introduced a year ago.
Ottawa had decided after 77 years that it was time to close the agency and hand responsibility for the 9,300 square kilometres it administers - an area nearly twice the size of Prince Edward Island - to the provinces where the land is located.
Rural and urban people were alarmed. Farmers worried about access to grazing; conservationists worried about losing the ancient prairie and protection for its many endangered species.
The memory of the Dirty Thirties runs deep in prairie dwellers. Even in wet years, they know the big dry will come again, and when it does, the PFRA will not be there to help.
Conservation promise broken
The PFRA story is about land, big pieces of it. We call them pastures, but this isn't your uncle's weed-filled back forty. The Val Marie pasture spans 100,000 acres and is just one of 62 the PFRA manages in Saskatchewan, along with 22 in Manitoba and one in Alberta.
The vast majority of all that acreage is native grass, the ancient buffalo prairie that has never felt the plow. Failed farms account for just 20 per cent.
As rare and ecologically important as coastal old-growth forest, the PFRA grasslands are listed by the World Commission on Protected Areas (WCPA) as lands that Canada has made a commitment to protect.
The federal government abandoned that commitment when it discontinued the PFRA.
No policy study, no rationale; in fact, Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz did not even bother to trot out the usual austerity arguments. He simply announced that the program had done its work, and could stand down. "The pastures are now well-established in the Prairies," he explained in a news release last April 18. "This change will create a great opportunity for provinces, stakeholders or those who use the land to take over pasture management."
The transition is to take place over the next three years and, unless there is a delay, this season will be the last for the first 10 pastures scheduled to leave the federal fold.
When people questioned the decision, Mr. Ritz, who grew up on a Saskatchewan grain farm, wrote to the Regina Leader-Post saying that "because farmers expect us to work smarter with their tax dollars, we are winding down programs like community pastures ... that have met their goals."
But westerners know better: The PFRA has been a smart investment for Canadians, returning far more in public benefits than its meagre costs.
A study sponsored by Agriculture Canada in 2006 estimated those benefits at $55-million a year, compared with the $22-million required to administer the pastures, more than half which was covered by fees charged for grazing cattle.
As for the program having achieved its goals, the need for soil conservation and managing ecosystems in the public interest does not simply go away. Not only can healthy grassland become overgrazed and infested with invasive species within a few years, well-resourced management will be even more important should the prairie provinces receive the longer, more intense droughts widely predicted by climate-change models.
Over the years, the PFRA has become a model of sustainable agriculture, and its pastures a fixture of the farm economy in much of rural Saskatchewan and Manitoba.
Phrases such as "food security" seldom arise at the coffee shop or rink, but many farmers know the PFRA is a bulwark against the forces now consolidating and globalizing the beef industry. With large feeder cattle operations and foreign-owned meat processors tilting the marketplace their way, community pastures have helped to sustain smaller operators, keeping our national livestock herd connected to local economies.
When that other icon of prairie farm economy, the Canadian Wheat Board, was stripped of its collective bargaining power last year, urban people, even in the grain-growing provinces, found it hard to grasp the significance. The PFRA controversy, by contrast, has cowboys sitting in rooms talking to aboriginal people, and farmers breaking bread with urban environmentalists and hunters.
The difference is in the common ground represented by the services that healthy native grassland has to offer all of us, town and country.
If well managed, grassland can flourish when subjected to grazing, but once it is plowed to grow crops, biologists say it has been "converted" because more than just the crocuses disappear; the appropriation is total. The public values and natural capital found in the prairie - its capacity to store carbon, foster biodiversity, stabilize fragile soils, filter and hold water, and provide recreation for hunters, hikers and naturalists, and stirring beauty for the rest of us - do not survive.
Some people raised in a grain-dependent culture will continue to consider all land that is treeless as "arable," but the pasture debate is an opportunity to show them that native range is no more "agricultural land" than a forest is a tree farm.
Yes, the buffalo are all but gone, but community pastures remain an essential component of a biome that the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) calls the most endangered and least protected of any on earth.
The Amazon Basin has lost 20 per cent of its rain forest, but 20 per cent is all that is left of the original prairie, most of it in fragments too small to support creatures that need it to survive.
In contrast, not only are PFRA pastures often large enough to function ecologically, they protect ecosystems that go back as far as 8,000 years, "old growth" by any definition.
As well, many of the creatures they contain are endangered - mammals such as the swift fox and 16 birds, including the greater sage grouse, long-billed curlew and Sprague's pipit.
Their well-being, under the Species at Risk Act, is Ottawa's responsibility, but the current administration has been criticized for not enforcing the act, adopted just over three years before Stephen Harper took power.
A former pasture manager resigned in frustration after watching the oil and gas industry damage the environment on his pasture, and now says he believes the decision to cut the PFRA was a gift to the resource industry because the federal legislation is not enforced on land that is private or provincially managed.
Absentee landlords
Whatever their motivation, Ottawa's policy-makers dropped the pastures into the laps of two provinces, neither of which seems to have any intention of paying for the independent supervision that has kept the land from being overgrazed and stripped of its plants and wildlife.
Manitoba decided to keep its 400,000 acres and just rent them out. Last August, the New Democratic Party government of Premier Greg Selinger announced a plan to work out a fair agreement with a new organization representing the "pasture patrons," whose cattle graze the land.
Handed a much bigger responsibility - 1.6 million acres - Saskatchewan initially took the opposite approach, saying it would sell off the pastures - instantly alarming nearly 2,000 cattle operators who depend on them but aren't necessarily willing or able to buy them.
Last week, after months of debate and increasing pressure, the government of Premier Brad Wall adopted a leasing arrangement similar to that of Manitoba, with one important difference: Patron groups still have the option to buy the land outright, removing it entirely from the public domain.
This upsets conservationists because, in a rapacious market, with everyone from investment groups to Chinese corporations sizing up Saskatchewan property, what is to stop the cattlemen from deciding that the real-estate market offers a better return, if raising livestock loses its appeal?
Also, a subsequent buyer may ask the courts to lift such restrictions. If crop prices go high enough, future owners could bring in the tractors no matter what the land title says.
The fact that prosecution for ignoring an easement is all but unheard of makes any penalty for breaking the prairie a risk worth taking.
An added complication
All the talk of who should own or control these vast holdings overlooks a wild card held by the province's First Nations: Treaty Land Entitlement (TLE), a framework established in 1992 to recognize that native communities did not always receive all the land they were entitled to when they signed their original treaties.
Now, a legal mechanism intended to make up that shortfall comes into play whenever Crown land is offered for sale, and the day after the decision to cut the pasture program was announced, the Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations (FSIN) contacted Ottawa to express interest.
TLE applications can be contentious in southern Saskatchewan, where land title is often complicated by mineral rights (be it oil, gas and coal or merely sand and gravel), but they could hold up the sale of PFRA pastures for some time.
Meanwhile, a smaller group of First Nations led by former FSIN chief Roland Crowe is taking another approach and trying to build bridges with both grazing patrons and the conservation community. That's a tall order in a province where Indian leadership is stereotypically associated with nepotism and fraud, but this group has committed itself to a multi-stakeholder governance system that would bring the First Nations' voice to a table of equals.
They say their aim is to develop a business model and management regime that builds on the successes of the existing program, while leaving the land under the Crown. On-the-ground management of the pastures would remain with the current staff.
Golden opportunity
So what does the future hold?
The dialogue now under way between farmers and conservationists, policy-makers and aboriginal people is a fascinating second look at our history in this landscape.
When I sit at meetings and listen to a presentation from someone representing the Saskatch-
ewan Wildlife Federation or a First Nations group, I wonder if we may yet get this right.
Last month, a new advocacy group called Public Pastures-Public Interest invited Saskatoon writer Candace Savage, the author of Prairie: A Natural History, to lecture on the plight of the pastures. She finished with a thought worth repeating:
The rich legacy of the PFRA lies in its public policy designed to try something else with the land, see what results and then adapt as necessary.
The program arose in response to an ecological crisis caused by misguided government programs, the ones that enticed Georgiaday Hall's ancestors and many others to take up homesteads on the poorest prairie soils.
If nothing else, those origins should give us pause as we decide how to treat the land that our dust-bowl forebears learned was best left to grow grass for the public good.
In our rush to harness the prairie to our desire, can we find the courage and imagination to seek a solution that is mindful of every displacement suffered in this world of grass, from buffalo and birds to its lost ways of life - indigenous and settler alike?

FROM THE INSIDE
'No one can eat a gallon of gas,' says a civil servant who rides a horse and fears what may lie ahead.
'We have to be more diligent'
By Trevor Herriot
It is not hard to pick Mert Taylor out of a crowd: white Stetson, square jaw, weathered skin and hundred-mile gaze - he looks to be a cowboy straight from Central Casting.
With more than 40 years in the saddle, Mr. Taylor is one of the longest-serving of the 300 managers and range riders who care for the 85 community pastures run by the Prairie Farm Rehabilitation Administration (PFRA).
Among the few remaining public servants to work on horseback, these cowboy conservationists keep an eye both on cattle and the many species whose survival (31 are already at risk) depends on their good stewardship.
Mr. Taylor has worked at several PFRA sites, and these days is the last word on grazing and conservation at Bigstick Community Pasture, 24,000 acres of mixed-grass prairie and saline wetlands northwest of Tompkins, halfway between Swift Current and the Alberta boundary.
"Growing up," he says, "I never wanted to be anything else but a cowboy."
However, having been with the PFRA more than half of its lifespan, he worries that when it is discontinued, there will be no one to carry on his work.
Mr. Taylor is well aware that so far the government agencies involved in the pasture transition seem to see no need to continue the PFRA management programs that have protected the grass and endangered biodiversity, and kept invasive plants at bay. He also knows, perhaps more than anyone, just what is at risk.
Initially silenced by his superiors in Agriculture Canada, he recently heard from his union, the Public Service Alliance of Canada, that he could safely express his opinion on certain topics if he became a shop steward.
"I'm covered now." he says, "I've been deputized."
Asked how the land will be managed once it has been sold or leased, provincial officials in Saskatchewan point out that ranchers already manage their own range: Why would these pastures need professionals?
That sounds reasonable, but people like Mr. Taylor know that running a ranch is not the same as running a 20,000-acre conservation area being grazed by cattle with 20 or 30 different owners.
"We are there to manage resources that belong to the citizens of Canada so that they will be there for future generations," he says.
Why can't the owners of the cattle do the job?
"The patrons we serve often live miles away from the pastures," Mr. Taylor says, "and, besides, they have a lot of other concerns that keep them busy in the grazing season. ... The bottom-line pressures of needing to get more income from their herd are always going to drive their decisions.
"For us, it's different. The health of the grass, the wildlife and livestock is our full-time job. We look at the longer term."
Resource extraction just ups the ante, he says. "With oil and gas, there is more pressure than ever on these pastures, and we have to be more diligent ...
"No one can eat a gallon of gas or a quart of oil. But if things keep going this way, Canadians will be getting all of their beef and everything else on their plate from other countries."
Once decision-making control is disconnected from federal programs and resources, is it fair or realistic to expect local cattlemen to shoulder the burden for protecting species at risk and the other public benefits the PFRA system provided to Canadians?
Guidelines suggested
In the past two weeks, 32 conservation groups from Canada, Mexico and the United States have endorsed a set of six principles to guide the transition of these internationally recognized grasslands.
These principles say that, for a leaseholding model to work, there must be a way to carry forward the knowledge base and authority of the independent pasture manager. The last principle states that, no matter what governance model controls the pastures, it must "sustain the investment in the public benefits provided by publicly owned community pastures."
If that investment is forsaken, Mr. Taylor says, "I don't want to see what it may look like here in a few years.
"I might come back to visit once - but, if it's as bad as I think it will be, I won't come back for a second look."

Full text:   For the next six months, Globe writer Ian Brown is residing in Banff to write about what geography means in a virtual age: whether who we are as Canadians still depends on where we are, and what any region takes from the national whole. To begin, he discovers a link between chain stores and cougars - the deadly, four-legged kind that turn out, to his alarm, to be living next door. A city slicker reports
Everyone who spends any length of time in Banff, the most famous small town in the country, has the wildlife conversation. Perhaps you are a skier, and you ask Dr. Margaret Clarke, a town resident you meet one day at lunch, where to find the most accessible cross-country trails. The following chat ensues:
Dr. Clarke : Well, there's the Cascade fire road. And there's the Spray Lakes loop behind the Banff Springs Hotel. Just don't go alone.
Newcomer: Why not?
Dr. Clarke: The bears are waking up, and they'll follow you.
Newcomer: In March? Isn't that a bit early?
Dr. Clarke: Not really. And there are four cougars in the area.
Newcomer: Cougars? Really?
Dr. Clarke: At least take some bear spray.
Hardly anyone who has lived here long carries anything so wiener-ish as bear spray while skiing. But you are a nervous newcomer. And so the next day, as you hand over $30 for a tube of pressurized capsaicin, you mutter sheepishly, by way of saving face, "I heard the bears are waking early this year."
"A bit early for that!" the customer behind you interjects merrily. She's a skier in her 40s. "But you can always use it on the cougars." It's not clear if she is taking the mick or not.
There are at least 10 cougars roaming the woods these days between Banff and Canmore, 15 kilometres down the Trans-Canada - a lot, even by local standards. The Rocky Mountain Outlook and The Banff Crag & Canyon carry stories every issue: big cats lolling, lounging, lunging and lurking on woodpiles, in backyards, at dogs, near schoolyards.
That's what cougars do. They're the four-legged version of the Mob: You never know when the hit will come.
None of this flusters the locals. What they are afraid of is Starbucks, and other invasive retail fauna. Last month, after 12 years of simmering debate, Banff's council rejected a proposal to limit chain stores, even though three-quarters of its residents were in favour of regulation. The general complaint is that "formula stores" undermine Banff's uniqueness as a showpiece of Canada's original national park.
Between the cougars and the coffee chains lies the question of what people should be more wary of: the encroachments of homogenized urban civilization, or a 90-kilogram cat that can snap your neck at a single pounce.
In the city, which is to say in most of the rest of the country, we presume that more is more: Growth is good and bigger is better, broader and brighter. But out here, in a place small enough to be examined on a granular scale, people think about this stuff all the time.
Coolly counting cougars
Steve Michel, Banff National Park's human-conflict wildlife specialist (note that the park has such a person), likens my new bear spray to a seatbelt: "You can go your whole life and not need a seatbelt. But you can't put it on after you've had the accident."
We're drinking coffee at Wild Flour, a bakery in what is known as downtown Banff. The downtown covers less area than a large mall in suburban Toronto.
"We don't know precisely how many cougars there are," says Mr. Michel, who looks like a wildlife officer - slim, red hair, tan uniform. (The necktie seems to be going extinct west of Winnipeg.) Counting cougars is as subtle, or impossible, as predicting the end of the Bitcoin bubble. Cougars require prey, mostly deer and elk; prey distribution depends in part on how much snow is covering the vegetation they feed on. This was a low-snow year in the town of Banff; hence, maybe, more cougars.
Thanks to remote cameras installed along the four wildlife corridors that surround Banff, Mr. Michel knew by January that four different cougars had taken up local residence. Snow-track analysis revealed at least four others, he adds: "We know we had one big male, and a couple of sub-adults." They were all within a 10-km radius of Banff and Canmore. A large cougar weighs 90 kilograms and is the size of a grown man, and also tawny, quiet, agile, fast and carnivorous. Cougars have a particular taste for small dogs and children. They kill before they eat by breaking their prey's neck or biting through the back of its skull.
Does that sound like something you want in the neighbourhood? In a small mountain town, the answer is yes. When a cougar left the remains of a deer near the playground of a school in Canmore recently, the school did not close, the world did not end. Instead, a few signs ("Cougar in Area") went up; parents were informed; and the Outlook ran its standard warning: "When encountering a cougar, the public is advised to immediately pick up children and pets and maintain eye contact with the cougar while backing away from the animal slowly. Do not turn your back on a cougar and never run."
When I tell Brandy Dahrouge, a local photographer, that I'm writing about cougars, she says, "I hear you never even know they're coming. So why worry about what you can't see?"
When the Outlook posted a photo of a cougar crouched in a Canmore backyard, the comments were so cool you could have collected them in a cone: "We're so lucky to have the opportunity to view wildlife like this," Dorinda Ainscough enthused, insanely if you ask me.
To an eastern city slicker, the good people here seem to be in deep denial. A wildlife corridor sounds like a great big thing - a barrier, say, on the order of the Mexican border. In fact, they're unmarked tubes that rim parks and schoolyards and subdivisions, which is what Steve Michel means when he says that "the interface between the town and the wilderness is really abrupt." The edge of the Tunnel Mountain corridor, an alleged favourite of cougars, is five minutes from where I am sitting as I write.
An eastern city type might also say, as occasional residents do: Look, these are predators encroaching on human space - move them. It doesn't work. The current cougar activity started when the last big cat in the area - known to all as Doug - died two winters ago at the advanced age of 14, resulting in an "influx of young sub-adult male cougars," all jostling for Doug's real estate. The mountain wilderness is like corporate life: The headstrong bucks and the crabby oldsters inflict most of the damage.
Doug "was like the celebrity cat around town," Mr. Michel says. He had the habit of leaving the remains of a sheep or a beheaded deer on the steps of a building, all without ever being spotted. "We never had a single problem with him, in more than a decade." A new big cat seems to be asserting himself this spring.
How much nature is too much nature, and how much is not enough? You can have that conversation in a city, but the conclusion is always a compromise. If a big-city planner claimed that a murderous neighbourhood was a reflection of the city's true nature and shouldn't be fixed, she would be torn apart. But in a mountain town, where the land defines your job and your life, where what you can consume is less important than what might consume you, these existential questions are daily fare. The mountains make people serious.
Should a national park be safely usable by everyone? Or should it preserve nature in its wildest and most dangerous state, so that we can remember what the world was like before man came trampling along?
"There is absolutely a range of opinion on this," Mr. Michel says. Residents have learned to co-exist with the wild things. Newcomers need help. "They're willing to live with wildlife, but they don't want them wandering through their condo complex. But they also understand that's part of the mystique of being in a place like Banff."
In the meantime, he and the town try to minimize clashes. Hiking with headphones? "That's like walking through the wilderness wearing a blindfold." The town also prohibits the planting of fruit trees. Bears like them too much.
Breaking the chains
Susanne Gilles-Smith launched the recent campaign against chain stores in Banff when Toronto-based David's Tea opened a branch on Banff Avenue 14 months ago. Ms. Gilles-Smith owns the rival Banff Tea Company as well as the Plain of Six Glaciers Teahouse, beloved of hikers in Lake Louise.
A lifelong resident of the Bow Valley, she insists that she was trying to protect Banff as much as her profits. "We sort of lose track that we live in a national park, and not in some cowboy town. We live in what is probably the most famous town in Canada. We could be a real flagship. We could set an example."
The fight came down to ideals versus real estate. Ms. Gilles-Smith, whose tea emporium is off the main drag, pays $50 a square foot; rents on Banff Avenue, the high-traffic frontage, run two to four times that sum, and that's before "key fees" that can top $100,000. According to Ms. Gilles-Smith, "It's some of the most expensive commercial real estate in Canada."
Its owners - three-quarters of Banff's downtown retail space is owned by six parties - were against a quota on chain stores because it would lower property values. Council voted 5-1 against.
"When you live in a national park," Ms. Gilles-Smith says, "you're supposed to protect what is dear to you - a community, a way of life that is unique, a unique perspective on the environment."
Recently I met a man who has resided in Banff since the late 1930s, "back when it was mainly a summer resort, when it used to be high end," he said. "People came for two months at a time. Now, Banff is a pretty wild place." He wasn't talking about cougars.
But chain stores also go way back here. The Feb. 3, 1933, edition of The Crag & Canyon bears a front-page headline: "Chain stores are menace to a community." And as Chip Olver, a councillor for the past 19 years, points out, "This town started as a chain. The whole Banff Springs-CP hotel was a chain to bring tourists into the mountains." Money-making has a pedigree in Banff as long as any white man's - just not as long as nature's.
What are the odds?
Statistically, I am more likely to be killed by falling airplane parts than I am by a cougar. Or so says Jerry Kobalenko, the author of Forest Cats of North America . We're skiing on the Cascade fire road, 15 minutes outside town, past the spot where Frances Frost, a 30-year-old cross-country skier, was killed by a two-metre-long cougar at 1 p.m. on Jan. 2, 2001. She is the only human being to have been killed by a cougar in Alberta in 115 years. People in town still talk about that day.
It was an innocent-looking place to die, no more than 200 metres from her car, to which she was headed at the time. Mr. Kobalenko examined the site right after the attack: The cat stalked the woman from the edge of the woods, avoiding the backward thrust of her ski poles, until it took her down by jumping on her back and biting through her spinal cord.
"Avoid that initial attack," Mr. Kobalenko says, "because it hits you like a ton of bricks." I do not find this advice reassuring. Still, he says, "unless you have a particular fear of cats, it's not an issue to be out, even in cougar country."
That's the logic of mountain thinking. "It's part of the culture of being here," Karsten Heuer, the filmmaking, book-writing president of the Yellowknife to Yukon Conservation Initiative, explains to me. "It's no different from people accepting the hazards of being mugged when you live in the big city. It's part of the contract of being here." He thinks that wild animals make him wilder, more alert. "The fact that in the Bow Valley we can still encounter these animals that can do us harm is a gift. It wakes us up and gives us some of their vitality."
Or, to put it as an insider at City Hall did, "We don't stay in our rooms because we know there's a cougar out there. We prepare for it, and go out. And we don't not go downtown because we know there's a McDonald's there. We know it's there, it has a role to play, and we're not going to have it dictate to us."
These days on my daily trips up Tunnel Mountain, I carry my bear spray 30 per cent of the time. I don't know why I do when I do, or why I don't when I don't. I suspect it has something to do with why people come to live in the mountains, where you can still be surprised every day - by a sharp shift in the weather, by a stark view you never noticed, by a cougar on your log pile, by how little separates the wild from the settled.
It makes logical sense to carry bear spray against cougars (protection against attack), and also not to carry it (far greater odds of setting it off accidentally in your own face), just as there are rational reasons for and against chain stores in a unique setting most Canadians worship. But a life isn't just about adding up. Out here, among the animals, that can still be true.

LISTING AND CO-OP AGENT
Bill Thom, Re/Max Realtron Realty Inc.
The Action: In early February, this detached residence opened its doors to over two dozen potential buyers, one of whom was a local homeowner looking to purchase a larger house in the well-established North York community.
What They Got: On a 34-by-169-foot pie-shaped lot at the far end of a cul-de-sac, this two-storey, brick house shelters 3,800-square-feet of living space finished with hardwood and ceramic tile floors, halogen pot lights and seven bevelled glass French doors.
* Ceilings rise nine-feet above the library, living and dining rooms and fireside family room, plus an eat-in kitchen with a walkout to a relatively new 22-by-13-foot deck and stone patio.
* Other highlights include a main-floor laundry room and winding, sky-lit staircase to a lower-level gym and five upper bedrooms. The master suite contains a walk-in closet and the largest of five bathrooms.
* Operations run smoothly with a new roof and high-efficiency heating and cooling systems installed after 2009.
The Agent's Take: "It's typical for this street, which is a fairly new street created 20 years ago. But the rest of the neighbourhood [homes] are smaller than this in the 2,000 to 2,200 [square foot range]," agent Bill Thom said.
"[The buyers] liked the welcoming, open concept, two-storey foyer; the kitchen is a large size; and it has a big side yard and backyard, which is what is lacking in their current home."
The half finished basement also had benefits. "They can finish it the way they want," Mr. Thom said.

Empire Communities is putting all the pieces in place for what it plans as a brand new community on one of the few remaining development sites on Etobicoke's former lakeside motel strip.
Eau du Soleil is "going to be an icon on the Etobicoke waterfront ...both from an architectural perspective and amenity perspective," says executive vice-president, Paul Golini.
For starters, the two towers, 66 and 45 storeys respectively, will have commercial outlets at their base and a new city park on a street evolving with several other residential developments.
"It's important to a large community like this one, not only to the residents of this sub-condo community, but also others in the area ... to shop and dine without having to get in their car," Mr. Golini says. "We're trying to enhance the active lifestyle that lakefront living already gives you."
At Eau du Soleil, this means another 40,000 square-feet of private facilities. "We tried to do some different with wine storage areas and a number of small garden plots that will be deeded and owned by purchasers so they can grow their own herbs and vegetables," Mr. Golini says.
"We're trying to highlight the fact you can be in a great area of Toronto - which is only 10 minutes away from the downtown core - without having to be in the midst of the chaos, but still be surrounded by green, water and trails."
The sixth floor will provide a salt-water pool and facilities for CrossFit training, spinning, yoga and martial arts, while the seventh floor will offer more than a handful of entertaining areas, terrace and outdoor basketball and tennis courts. Plus, residents on the 50th floor and above will have access to a penthouse lounge.
Architectural firms Zeidler Partnership and E.I. Richmond Architects also designed the glass high-rises - accented with white metal bands illuminated with LED lights - to optimize sight-lines of everything from winding boardwalks to major event venues. "We're in the fortunate position to have great views on all sides," Mr. Golini states. "From the Etobicoke waterfront, you have two great views: Those that are lake views and also those that are city views."
To celebrate two decades of building communities throughout the GTA, the developer is also launching a program that will allow buyers who save lives to save money on their next home.
Policemen, firefighters, emergency and hospital professionals will receive a 2-per-cent discount on residences at the developer's latest projects, such as Eau du Soleil. Plus $1,000 will be donated to a local hospital or support service. "We always try to establish strong relationships with the community we build in, so it's not just about putting in a tower or building a low-rise community," says Mr. Golini. "Everyone wants these people to be in their community doing their jobs, but we want these people living in the communities and not having to commute. So it's about providing affordable living for these key people that contribute to the fabric of our community."
The initiative - called the Heroes program - is one of many to cultivate a sense of the community in and around the two-tower development on the former Beach Motel site on Lakeshore Boulevard by the entrance to Humber Bay Park.
Since previews began last year, only a third of 750 units remain in the tallest tower, which contains one to three bedroom models. "We're pleasantly surprised by the fact we've sold a bit of everything, which is not always the case," Mr. Golini says.

Full text:   A sample of the nominees we've received so far. Profiles by Deirdre Kelly
OPI SAINT
Rocking and shocking
Ottawa rocker Opi Saint wants to scare you. He has painted his face white over which he has drawn large black eyes and a macabre smile. On a given night on stage he might look as if he's spitting blood, or cutting himself. But it's really just an act.
"I'm a high-energy showman," says the self-taught singer who counts Alice Cooper and the Murderdolls as among his musical influences.
"I also like horror movies," adds the frontman for the band Patron Saint of Plagues. "The genre has always appealed to me. When I was younger it scared me, and now I enjoy being scared and listening to bands who write music for or about it."
The 24-year-old son of a mother in real estate and a father who works in information technology did not invent shock rock. That honour goes to Screamin' Jay Hawkins in the mid-1950s, whose imitators include Rob Zombie, Ozzy Osbourne, Marilyn Manson and KISS. Nor did the older of two brothers have much exposure to it growing up. Saint was born the year George Michael topped the chart with Faith and came of age when Alicia Keys was belting out Fallin' . Rather tame stuff.
"The theatrical side of rock music has always been there, it just wasn't being noticed as much in recent years," continues the soft-spoken entertainer. "We want to bring it back to the mainstream, and this is our way of doing it."
Despite sometimes receiving complaints from other people's parents and members of his own peer group who just don't get what he's doing - "It's not for everybody," he acknowledges - Saint's form of horror rock is spawning imitators in the Ottawa region where he and his bandmates typically play comic conventions and gigs in the area.
"There are now other bands starting to wear face paint and step up their stage show," says Saint. "I like to think we played a part in that."
**********
DANNY FOURNIER
Behind the music
When Danny Fournier co-founded the Edmonton Music Awards in 2011, the inaugural ceremony coincided with his first son's due date.
"My wife was really mad at me," discloses the 39-year-old music consultant. "But that's me. I tend to put a lot on my plate."
He'll again have a lot of work to do when the show's third edition opens at the Royal Alberta Museum Theatre on April 28.
Beyond the flurry of pop stars and country singers, rappers and hip hop artists, all of them representing the diversity of music genres at work in Alberta's capital city, the Saskatchewan native will be toiling anonymously behind the scenes, making sure the winners' names are in the right envelopes and generally calming nerves. "It's not about me," Fournier says when asked why the chief executive is not instead relishing the glory from a front-row seat. "It's about the artists."
Putting artists and their music first comes naturally to him.
The oldest of three children born to music teachers (his father, Jean Lawrent Fournier, is a well-known classical and flamenco guitarist), Fournier is also the grandson of Margo Fournier, a former dancer and musician who founded the Prince Albert Boys' Choir. "There was a definite passion for music where I grew up," Fournier says.
When part way through a marketing degree and worrying that he had turned his back on music, his father convinced him he hadn't made a mistake. "He told me that the music industry is all about marketing, and it's the one thing that musicians really don't know a lot about." In 2006, he founded Oddball Productions, a consulting company aimed at helping musicians build and execute a business plan with minimal hassle. "Wherever it is they want to go," says Fournier, whose acts include rockers Shelbi, alt rock folk band Owls by Nature and newcomers Heaviside, "I help them get there."
***********
CEDAR SWAN
Cedar Swan has the right name for what she does for a living.
The daughter of hippies who named her for the abundance of cedar trees surrounding her on Canada's West Coast, Swan has a career that keeps her constantly connected to Canada's great outdoors. Emphasis on great. As the vice-president of Adventure Canada, a tour operator specializing in High Arctic cruises and land-based adventures, she promotes the Arctic to Canadians and others, emphasizing its uniqueness as a tourist destination.
"It's really about making the North accessible to people who might have thought the Arctic too remote," she says from her Mississauga home, which is decorated with Inuit art. "It's closer than many people think, and there's more to it than polar bears and ice."
With her expedition teams of marine biologists and local artists among other Arctic experts, Swan has taken thousands of tourists - some from as far away as Australia and Japan - past the tree line in summer months when the ice breaks and the midnight sun is out to explore what she calls Canada's last frontier. "It's not just the vast open spaces of the land," continues the 31-year-old mother of a newborn daughter who has been running her family's business since 2004. "It's the openness of the Inuit people which keeps me fascinated. Their friendliness and warmth form such a contrast to the harshness of their environment."
The North, in other words, is warmer than it appears. Swan was 14 when she went to Iqaluit for the first time, travelling there with her father, Matthew Swan, who had founded Adventure Canada in 1987 with wife, June Bradley. "I realized then that the Arctic was my calling. "

Abstract: "If the university was going to build a new school of arts on campus, the city was not going to play a financial role," says Windsor Mayor Eddie Francis. "As soon as the university says 'we will play a role in economic development downtown,' they got $10-million from us and the buildings for $1 each. It really is a shared opportunity."

Full text:   City sale of heritage buildings - including a former bus depot and Armouries for $2 - opens the door to a new postsecondary cluster
Three kilometres is a short distance, but far enough to isolate the University of Windsor from downtown.
That's about to change. With key support from the city, the university begins construction this summer on a $70-million campus at the foot of the Ambassador Bridge.
Once strangers, Canadian postsecondary institutions and local municipalities now see themselves as intimate allies in realizing their respective ambitions. In Windsor, the collaboration features a once-dominant car town struggling to redefine itself and a below-the-radar university, turning 50 this year, seeking to raise its profile.
By September, 2014, the University of Windsor expects to offer programs in three heritage buildings being renovated and expanded to serve 2,000 students and faculty.
"We recognize the downtown is where we have the home of the symphony, the art gallery and the theatres and all the social agencies," says University of Windsor president Alan Wildeman. "It lets us fulfill what is part of our strategic plan, which is to create one of the most exciting learning environments we can."
Rebuffed by previous University of Windsor administrators, the city last year found the institution receptive to expanding downtown - historically off-limits to postsecondary institutions under past zoning rules - to complement other municipal efforts to reinvigorate a careworn core.
In 2012, the city sold two landmark properties - the former Armouries and a former bus depot (and an adjacent city parkette) - to the university for $2. The city also contributed $10-million for the project, along with $25-million from the province.
"If the university was going to build a new school of arts on campus, the city was not going to play a financial role," says Windsor Mayor Eddie Francis. "As soon as the university says 'we will play a role in economic development downtown,' they got $10-million from us and the buildings for $1 each. It really is a shared opportunity."
The Armouries, which date to 1902, will house the university's newly merged schools of music, film, sonic and visual arts, with a new recital hall on one end of the 110-year-old building and a newly excavated lower level for shared teaching spaces.
Across the street, the 1939 Greyhound bus depot will be restored to reveal an art deco façade of limestone and granite currently shrouded in metal siding and stucco, with an infill of a one-storey addition behind the existing building for studio space to accommodate the university's film programs.
Behind the depot, a former city parkette is set to become a performance space for student and community use, complementing city ambitions to reconnect public spaces to a spectacular waterfront that lies 7.6 metres below street grade.
In another nod to connections, Mr. Wildeman broke from past practice with a pledge to exclude food services from the renovated buildings - an invitation to business to invest in coffee shops and other retail activity nearby .
As important as the buildings themselves is their location - across from each other on University Avenue. City and university officials envision the transformation of the wide, dreary thoroughfare into a multi-modal transportation spine (with green space) linking downtown and the main campus.
A five-minute walk from the Armouries and bus depot is the former Windsor Star building, purchased last year by the university from The Star as another project anchor. The heritage façade remains, but the 1920s-era building is being gutted and expanded for the School of Social Work and the Centre for Professional and Executive Education, chosen for the space because of their downtown-oriented programming.
"Through the 1950s and 1960s, the automobile ruled the roost and then as that industry started to deteriorate so has the city," observes Craig Goodman, principal of CS & P Architects Inc., hired to design and implement the new campus. "This is creating a huge opportunity for a refreshed view of what Windsor could be, and the university is going to play a huge part in that."
Key to revitalizing the core is foot traffic. With pioneering moves downtown by St. Clair College that began in 2007 with city support, the core eventually could attract up to 5,000 postsecondary students.
"When the university gets fully established and you have activity on the street, it will drive other activities," predicts Peter Whatmore, senior vice-president for Southwestern Ontario at CBRE Ltd., a commercial real estate services firm. "Like any downtown, it needs feet on the street and needs to feel and look safe to people who would say 'I would like to spend my money here.'"
Over the past six years, the city has made a series of investments to create new downtown destinations for arts and entrepreneurial clusters . The expected pedestrian activity contrasts to limited foot traffic from the Windsor Casino which, by design, attracts patrons indoors. "The [postsecondary] facilities will create foot traffic the casino does not," observes Thom Hunt, executive director of planning for Windsor.
Still, some wonder whether an influx of students will be enough to redefine Windsor, whose auto-manufacturing employment was sliced in half to about 13,300 jobs in 2011 from a decade earlier, according to the Canadian Auto Workers.
Italo Ferrari, president and owner of Wilsondale Assets Management, which controls more than half a million square feet downtown, says economic spinoff from students is "an optical illusion," because they lack disposable income to patronize specialty shops downtown.
But others see the downtown campus as a timely effort to repair a frayed urban fabric. What's happening in Windsor, says CS & P's Mr. Goodman, "is a wonderful merging of public and private sectors and that is what cities are all about."

Full text:   Over a three-week train journey along the path of Chairman Mao's historic Long March of the 1930s, correspondent Mark MacKinnon travelled into the economic giant's heartland, beyond the horizons of Beijing and Shanghai. From rice paddies to dance clubs and corporate towers, he found the people of the rising power hopeful about prosperity but furious over corruption, and unsure of the promises of new president Xi Jinping - a country on the verge of either renewal or breakdown
The police in Liangjiahe were onto us before we even glimpsed the famous caves where China's new leader once lived.
"Come in here," a plainclothes Public Security Bureau officer said, grabbing me by the elbow seconds after I stepped out of a taxi near the walled compound that is the village's administrative centre. He steered us into a small room where other officers quickly joined us.
The men took down our passport and visa numbers. They asked what we were doing in Liangjiahe (Lee-ung-jah-huh), a town of a few hundred people in the remote northern corner of Shaanxi (Shan-see) province.
But they already knew the answer: It was because this is where Xi Jinping, the man who became China's President on March 14, was exiled and assigned to hard labour during the Cultural Revolution of the 1960s and 1970s.
Other reporters, we knew, had been chased away by plainclothes officers like the men around us, without ever seeing the cave-house Mr. Xi lived in during his teenage years. Now we feared the same. Our hopes sank as the police explained that we needed permission from the local Communist Party secretary to do any reporting in Liangjiahe.
An hour passed, then two. I grimly contemplated the possibility that we had spent 22 days travelling around China by train only to be stopped a few hundred metres from our goal.
We had been following roughly the route of Mao Zedong's historic Long March, which helped to give birth to the country's modern communist identity.
Mr. Xi's teenaged home Liangjiahe is just 80 kilometres from the city of Yan'an, the place where the Red Armies rested and regrouped in 1935 at the end of their march.
As we waited for a decision, the officers gave us permission to wander into the courtyard of the building, where two old men sat warming themselves in the midwinter sun.
Their lives had to have been marked by the arrival of Mr. Xi in 1969, and I bet they would tell that story again and again to whoever asked. I squatted down and asked if they could tell me what they remembered.
BEIJING: A NATION REMADE, BUT IN WHAT IMAGE?
Mr. Xi's inauguration capped more than four years that I have been in China - all of them astonishing to experience, but almost impossible to summarize.
I arrived on the last day of the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing and sat that evening in the city's Temple of the Earth park to watch the closing ceremonies on a big-screen television.
The crowd seemed pleasantly surprised at how well their country had handled its moment in the spotlight.
By 2010, China had passed Japan to become the world's second-largest economy, behind only the United States. China was suddenly the other centre of the world. Economically and diplomatically, people increasingly spoke of a new superpower structure, a "G2" made up of Washington and Beijing.
There were symbolic leaps forward too: China put its first woman in space last summer, and completed its first manned space-docking. The first Chinese aircraft carrier, the Liaoning, launched in September.
With all that has come a more assertive foreign policy, especially within East Asia, where China has deployed its coast guard and navy to back territorial claims.
A minority of Chinese are loudly supportive. The rest are proud in a more detached and uncertain way: Their country is being transformed, largely through their hard work, but they have no say in what happens next.
There is a widespread fear that their gains are not safe - polls show that more than half of rich Chinese have made some preparations to leave the country.
Much of the outcome for China and the world depends on Mr. Xi, and what he does with his decade as the country's "paramount leader."
To get a better sense of him and the challenges he is inheriting, I began compiling a list of stories I wanted to follow - economic, environmental and political - in far-flung parts of the country, including Liangjiahe.
One afternoon, I plotted them on a map and an unexpected pattern emerged: You could draw an extended arc through those dots and trace a course not too different from that of the fabled Long March that Mao Zedong and his Red Armies had taken more than seven decades earlier.
Then, Mao and his comrades were making a tortuously slow, almost fatal overland retreat from positions that had been surrounded by the armies of Chiang Kai-shek's ruling Kuomintang.
Today, Mao's former Party looks to be on the move again, at least in spirit, and almost as slowly - inching back from a totalitarian system that seems doomed to implode without reform.
By retracing the Long March of the 1930s, I hoped to discover a little bit about where Mao's heirs might be headed next.
I had fostered a love of trains by riding through desolate parts of my former post, Russia. So, along with photographer John Lehmann and Yu Mei, the Beijing-bureau news assistant, I decided to spend three weeks on Chinese trains in the middle of winter.
The Globe published individually many of the stories we found along the way. But it's the sweep of the journey that sticks with me. The trip made me fall back in love with China - or at least its people - after a period of personal disillusionment caused by living with the poisonous air, intrusive security and lobotomizing censorship that are facts of life in the People's Republic.
Beijing, the trip reminded me, is a cynical city that governs a relentlessly optimistic people.
But the journey also showed me how that Chinese sense of hope - and patience - is being tested in 2013, at the same time as their country is going through what could prove to be a pivotal change at the top.
As we rolled west and then north over those 22 days, I witnessed the first successes and failures of a local democracy movement, grinding poverty and inequality, and the early stirrings of civil society.
Collectively, the people I met believe that the time has come for China to change. It does not need to become a Western-style democracy with elected leaders, at least not yet. But it does need to become a fairer place, and soon.
There are 1.3 billion people marching forward into what are unquestionably their country's brightest hours. But they do so wondering if national greatness for China - and more money in their pockets - is worth the sense of powerlessness that comes with this moment of pride.
GUANGZHOU SOUTH RAIL STATION: ALL ABOARD
To take a long-distance train through China is to travel between worlds. One moment, the scene out your window is five-star hotels and corporate towers; the next, it's rice paddies and squat homes with thatched roofs.
You have left the developed China that Western businessmen know, and entered the left-behind countryside where little has changed since imperial times.
China's rapidly expanding network of high-speed trains is an effort to patch together those different Chinas, addressing many problems at once.
The most obvious goals are economic: The construction of eight high-speed lines - four running east-west, the others north-south - over the past five years has created work for 100,000 people.
A pair of rail expansion plans worth hundreds of billions of dollars, first in 2009 and then again last year, helped to avoid predicted slowdowns in growth for the world's second-largest economy.
The high-speed network hints at what China could be. It also suggests what holds it back. Here are trains running faster than those in Europe, with the Communist Party as the metaphorical locomotive pulling along a hard-working people who are getting rich enough to afford such luxuries. But the project has been undermined by the endemic corruption that threatens seemingly every gain the country makes.
The new railways are taking some of the burden off the nation's incredibly overcrowded slow-coach services. When all the seats and bunks on those routes are sold out, they sell tickets for standing room, even on routes that are 20 or 30 hours long.
On overnight trains, it is common to see families with small children camping in any nook - often the covered area connecting the cars - that they can claim as their space.
The high-speed trains are also an environmental leap forward, emitting far less pollutants than the older versions - no small matter when many of China's large cities are among the most polluted in the world.
Another purpose - as with the Canadian Pacific Railway back in the 1880s - is nation-building.
One of the most startling things about visiting less-traveled parts of China is how disconnected this seeming monolith of a country can be. People in coastal Guangdong, the birthplace of the Cantonese language, are as different from Beijingers in speech, diet and mindset as Sicilians are from Belgians.
In some villages we visited farther inland, the first challenge was finding a local Mandarin speaker who could translate for us, since few of the locals could understand standard Chinese.
Keeping the Chinese empire intact remains as real a challenge for Xi Jinping in 2013 as it posed to emperors of the Ming and Qing dynasties.
The Communist Party is betting that high-speed rail will serve to draw these different Chinas closer together, making the nation a more solid construction.
Our first train ride of the trip was on one of these new multipurpose supertrains, known as G-trains, travelling north at ear-popping speed between Guang-zhou and Changsha, the capital of central Hunan province.
The G-train slid almost noiselessly out of the futuristic Guangzhou South railway station, a hangar of a place that features a McDonalds and a Family Mart convenience store.
As we picked up speed, we were quickly back in a China that knows few such modernities. Soon, we were travelling 308 kilometres an hour, and the images out the window began to blur.
LIANGJIAHE REVISITED: EATING BITTERNESS
By the time we arrived at the gate of Mr. Xi's former cave-house, we had seen progress everywhere our trains had stopped: apartment buildings rising from the ground, dirt roads being paved, high-speed railway lines coming into service, mobile phone networks spreading to the remotest corners of the country.
But we also heard again and again how little China has changed when it comes to the rule of law. As in Mao's time, the Communist Party can still demolish your home, declare that you are a "subversive" element, and send you to prison or a labour camp without any proof or chance to defend yourself.
The system empowers the corrupt and makes dissidents out of earnest people who want to better their country. Somewhere else, the persecuted Ai Weiwei might be only a moderately successful contemporary artist; Liu Xiaobo, the Nobel Peace Prize laureate now facing eight more years in jail, could have been just another grumpy author.
Xi Jinping is the first Communist Party leader who comes to power with a biography that may give him an understanding of that systemic flaw. As a 15-year-old, he had his life shattered.
The man he had grown up idolizing, his father - revolutionary hero Xi Zhongxun - had been condemned as a member of an anti-communist clique and sent to do hard labour in the countryside. The family was plunged into disgrace.
The younger Mr. Xi spent seven years digging ditches and doing farm labour in Liangjiahe, where the soil is so loose and dry that little besides corn can grow.
Like the others here, he lived in a cave-like tunnel he and his fellow labourers carved into the rocky hillside, adding only the modern touches of a metal door and windows at the entrance. Water came from a well, and there was heat only if he collected scrub to burn.
One of the old men I met while waiting in the courtyard told me that his name is Mr. Wang. He had helped to build the village dike alongside Xi Jinping 40-some years ago, in a very different China.
Mr. Wang's and Mr. Xi's lives have diverged unthinkably since the days they shovelled dirt side by side in Shaanxi province: Mr. Xi wears sharp suits and drives about in armoured limousines; Mr. Wang wears an oversized and tattered blue worker's jacket, and only black slippers on his feet despite the winter chill.
"We were farmers. I didn't think anyone I knew could ever be the country's leader," Mr. Wang said, admitting that he was nervous to talk about his old comrade.
But he would say he hoped that Mr. Xi remembered what it was like to "eat bitterness" - a catch-all Chinese expression for living though whatever hardships life throws at you.
"I think it will be helpful to him that he had this experience," Mr. Wang said. "He ate bitterness here, just like us."
Two reversals of fortune
Once I was allowed to speak with other locals, I found that they remembered a young man who arrived from Beijing speaking only standard Mandarin, unable to understand the local dialect.
But he impressed them with his willingness to work as hard as any of them, one winter taking off his shoes and rolling up his trousers to help to build a dike in the town's frigid river.
"I didn't expect a city boy could come here and live like us," said Liang Youchang, an 83-year-old farmer who worked alongside Mr. Xi building the dike. "When he came back [in the early 1990s] to visit along with his sister, she was weeping when she saw how tough his life had been."
There's a Communist star carved into the stone over the door to Mr. Xi's former cave-home, alongside Mao's famous injunction to "serve the people."
Mr. Xi's family was rehabilitated following Mao's death in 1976, which brought an end to the Cultural Revolution, and his father became a key adviser to Deng Xiaoping in the 1980s, when he moved to open China's state-run economy.
The elder Mr. Xi was charged with creating the "Special Economic Zone" of Shenzhen, then a fishing village adjacent to Hong Kong. The younger Mr. Xi rose through the ranks under his father's protection. He graduated from the engineering program at Beijing's prestigious Tsinghua University and by the time he was 32 years old he was executive vice-mayor of the port city of Xiamen.
Now a thick-set man who favours dark suits and red ties, Mr. Xi was introduced in November in Beijing's Great Hall of the People as the new leader of the Communist Party, the latest successor to Mao Zedong. With no hint of rancour, he makes sure in almost every speech to include a few words of praise for the man who once destroyed his family.
It's a rags-to-riches story the party is not yet sure how to tell, perhaps since it illustrates how fluid and ill-defined justice was, and is, in the People's Republic.
WUKAN: THE TOWN THAT STOOD UP FOR ITSELF - AND WONDERS WHAT IT GAINED
If our final stop reminded us of Mr. Xi's challenge - fix the system before the people's patience runs out - our first destination on our railway journey showed us how near that breaking point might be.
We came to Guangdong province (where Mao's Red Armies began their Long March) and in the southeast, to the fishing village of Wukan - a town of 1,300 people that has become synonymous in China with both rippling unrest and its primary causes: corrupt local officials and the deals they make with property developers.
Wukan is a place of squat concrete homes surrounded by palm trees, a meagre fishing harbour and two out-of-place constructions that flick at what went wrong: a sprawling holiday resort that looks like it has never had a guest (though locals say it's frequented by Communist Party officials) and the towering gold-domed headquarters of the county-level finance department.
The finance building looks fit for the government of an oil-rich sultanate, rather than a fishing village 230 kilometres from the nearest airport. Locals sneeringly call it the Gold House. The resort is the Shenzhen Air Holiday Hotel. The villagers collectively owned part of the land it was built on before it was privatized in 1999.
All those with a claim were supposed to receive compensation, but it was meagre compared with the profits developers and local officials made. It was a pattern that would be repeated again and again over the following decade.
Fury over corruption and the court system that enables it is palpable across China. Since the country's last popular uprising - which ended with the bloody military crackdown on Tiananmen Square in 1989 - the vast majority of Chinese have accepted silently the Communist Party's new deal: In an opened-up economy, people will be free to make their fortunes. Just don't challenge our right to rule.
But party cadres, all the way up, have shown themselves unable to stick to their side of the bargain. Local officials grab larger and larger shares of the wealth. Town bosses force villagers off farmland to bring in real-estate projects that deliver huge personal profits. Money earmarked for public-works projects disappears into the pockets of local officials, hundreds of millions of dollars at a time.
The anger is not so far of the focused sort that has toppled Arab governments since 2011. But without any effective formal way to address grievances, tens of thousands of protests are occurring in the country a year.
In 2010 (the last year for which statistics are available), there were 180,000 "mass incidents" around the country. They range from the brief but angry demonstrations that occasionally swell over perceived abuses by individual policemen, to full-on village uprisings. Wukan's is the most famous.
In 2009, an anonymous resident put together a pamphlet that listed all the transactions and showed how little property would be left for Wukan's future generations.
"We were supposed to have received huge compensation. The people realized that if we didn't speak up, we'd lose our last land," said Zhang Jiangxing, a 21-year-old blogger whose online writings helped to galvanize the population.
Residents realized that the problem would not change until their government did. They took to the streets in late 2011, demanding the right to choose their own representatives. (Chinese villages have held "elections" for decades, but the candidates are carefully screened by the Communist Party and the results are predetermined.)
They took over the centre of town, a pink-brick plaza known as Little Square, provoking a showdown with armed police, who surrounded Wukan and choked off the supply of food and water in an effort to force residents to back down.
The villagers refused to budge, and eventually achieved a remarkable breakthrough in recent Chinese history: the right to vote freely for the village council. The new seven-man council elected in February, 2012, had only one Communist Party member on it.
The new council made a show of transparency - making its books public for the first time - and set about a series of public-works projects. But recovering the villagers' land has proved more challenging than achieving local democracy. The problems stretch far higher than the village council can reach.
"All we're asking for is fairness from the government. We want the corrupt officials to spit out the money they have swallowed. I have five sons, seven people in my family, and no land at all," said Huang Zhiliang, a 40-year-old occasional labourer who approached us as we stood on Little Square.
"If we don't get it back, we will ask our leaders to bring the people together again to protest."
CHANGSHA: A 'NAIL HOUSE' MOTHER'S LONELY STANDOFF
Identical problems - land seizures, official corruption and a sense that ordinary people can do nothing - are easy to find 1,000 kilometres northwest in Changsha, the capital of Hunan province, a short drive from Mao's birthplace in the mountain town of Shaoshan.
Tens of thousands of pilgrims still make their way to Shaoshan each year to bow and lay flowers at the foot of a six-metre-high statue of the chairman - some believe Mao has become a deity, watching over the People's Republic that he founded.
We were met at Changsha South train station by Zhang Yuxiang, a 59-year-old tailor and a mother of one who had been fighting a years-long battle to stop local officials from demolishing her modest family home.
Ms. Zhang collapsed into tears as soon as we were all in a van together. "I'm so happy you're here. It gives me hope," she sobbed. "I haven't slept for five days."
She and her neighbour are two of a large, uncounted number of "nail house" owners across China - that is, "stubborn nails" who refuse to make way for development.
She took us to what had once been her neighbourhood, near the smog-shrouded centre of Changsha. Where there had been more than 100 homes flanked by farmlands now stood only a vast construction site, with apartment blocks - dozens of storeys high - rising out of the rust-brown dirt.
At the edge remained two forlorn homes, those of Ms. Zhang and her neighbour. Both had refused the local government's demand that they move out and accept the offered compensation of about $27,000.
"It's too low," Ms. Zhang said, her eyes flashing with anger. "Even if I took the compensation, I could never afford another home. Those that took the compensation were relocated to another place, and their land has already been sold from under them again."
(Land in China is owned either by collectives or by the state, meaning an individual rarely has a protected right to their land.)
Ms. Zhang's decision not to leave the home where she ran her tailoring shop for 22 years and raised her only son had turned her life into a Kafkaesque nightmare. Two years ago, the government cut off her water and electricity. Men came into her house and ripped out the sink and stove.
Now, the main room - which used to be her tailoring shop - looked as though it had been hit by a missile. Her bedroom looked like a camp erected by a homeless person, which in many ways is what she had become.
She slept at night on a hard box-spring covered with thin quilts. By her pillow she kept a toothbrush, a flashlight and an umbrella for the rain that would pour through the many cracks in her roof.
Her husband and son had already moved out. "It's too dangerous for my son to be here," she explained.
In July of 2012, Ms. Zhang - once the head of the local village committee - was taken into police custody for the first time. Though she was never charged with any crime, she said she was tortured by six men simply because she had been defiant.
"I was handcuffed behind my back," she said, crossing her hands behind her. "Then they [defecated] in water and poured it down my throat."
As she spoke she was down on her knees in the back of the van, forcing her own mouth open to show how she had been made to drink. She claimed the head of the local Public Security Bureau and the head of her village council had been directly involved.
Like many of China's petitioners, Ms. Zhang blamed local officials for what has happened to her, not the top leadership in Beijing. As the construction moved closer to her house - there was now rubble piled up on all sides of her lonely structure - she had hung a red banner her rooftop. "Protect farmers' legal rights!" it read.
The banner was positioned beside a photograph of Xi Jinping standing at a flower-dressed podium. She said she believed Mr. Xi would save her home, if only he knew what was happening.
ON THE K-TRAIN: THE NEW CHINA PLAYS ITS CARDS
Our next trip began in Chang-sha's 100-year-old main railway station. Despite the new high-speed terminal across town, the old station was still bursting with unwashed passengers, shoving and carrying humongous bags on their backs.
We headed back south aboard one of the K-train slow coaches that are the workhorses of China's rail network, crisscrossing the country at a much more modest top speed of 120 kilometres an hour.
John Lehmann, Yu Mei and I were booked in "soft sleeper" class - the nicest, with four narrow bunks to a compartment, and overhead space to cram your bags into. Sharing our room was Kelvin Chan, a 30-year-old real-estate developer from Hong Kong. "Maybe they stick all the people with [foreign] passports in the same cabin," he guessed, speaking the first English we had heard on the trip.
Mr. Chan was on the other side of China's great scramble for real estate. He is one of the people brought in by local governments to build New China after Old China - made up of people like Ms. Zhang - is shoved aside.
When the economy was roaring a few years ago, Mr. Chan's company (owned by his father) worked on developments in bigger cities such as Changsha. But the global economic crisis has tempered enthusiasm for new building even in China, where the whole country often feels like a vast construction site. The company has been forced to start looking for business at the county level.
They found that the economic downturn had not dampened the enthusiasm of local officials for big-money projects. Mr. Chan was headed to southern Hunan to oversee the construction of a 13-building apartment-retail complex - each building 18 storeys high - in a town of 70,000 people.
According to Mr. Chan, the economics of such transactions heavily favour the local government. For his upcoming project, the town council had compensated residents at roughly 50,000 yuan, or $8,000, per mu (a Chinese unit of land measurement - 15 mu equals one hectare). The town then sold the land to Mr. Chan's company at closer to $225,000 per mu, an astonishing 2,800-per-cent markup.
Even still, Mr. Chan said that his company can still make a 20-per-cent profit by selling the finished properties on to eager buyers. The only hiccups were residents like Ms. Zhang who refuse to take their cash and leave.
"We do have some problems with them," he acknowledged as our train rumbled south. "But we just give some more cash to the government and eventually they solve it."
GUIYANG: LEFT BEHIND BY CENTURIES
Another six hours south by the slower T-train - this time by "hard sleeper" class, six bunks per berth - sits Guiyang, the capital of China's poorest province, Guizhou. Guiyang is what they call a "third-tier" city in China - one left behind not just by the racing coastal economies, but even by interior cities that have geographical advantages that places like Guiyang do not.
Guizhou province has nothing: no sizable industries, no natural resources other than coal, not even the farmland that so much of the country has as a fallback plan.
Its main export is its people, who travel to the first- and second-tier cities to work in the factories, often leaving their children in the care of elderly grandparents so they can make an extra few thousand yuan a month needed for the kids' education.
The wealth gap in China can be staggering to observe up close. Parts of Guizhou feel not just thousands of kilometres but hundreds of years away from the ultramodern skylines on Beijing and Shanghai. Even more jarring is the evidence on the streets of Guiyang, where you can see a family of three sharing a mud-covered scooter on one street and an immaculately clean Lamborghini on the next.
The outgoing tandem of president Hu Jintao and premier Wen Jiabao made Guizhou the focus of their Construct a New Socialist Countryside campaign, pouring billions into building new roads over the past decade, connecting many villages to water and electricity for the first time.
The improvements in poor provinces such as Guizhou - nearly everyone we spoke to said their lives had improved in the preceding 10 years - will probably stand as one of the chief accomplishments of the Hu-Wen era.
Much of that effort, though, was undermined by official corruption at the local level, blended with impunity and a disregard for those less fortunate.
In Wanzi, the children of Confucius wait in vain
By chance, the taxi driver who collected us from our hotel in the morning was named Kong Dezheng, a member of one of the most unique families in China: The Kongs are the direct descendants of Kong Qiu, the sage the outside world knows as Confucius.
A thousand men with Confucius's last name ("We don't count the women," a village elder told me) live in a hamlet called Wanzi, a collection of concrete homes clinging to the side of a dirt road that is a winding, five-hour drive west of Guiyang, through the mountains.
The descendants of Confucius live little differently now than their ancestors did centuries ago, when part of the family first moved here from the northeast of the country. The Kongs grow enough corn in the rocky land to get by, but not enough extra to sell. The young and able leave Wanzi to go work in the coastal factories, leaving their children in the care of the grandparents who remain.
This is a village of old people and babies. It's also a place of extreme poverty. The homes are clustered around a single dirt road that turns into a mudslide when it rains.
"Being related to Confucius hasn't brought us any extra food," said Kong Lingmei, a 69-year-old retired teacher and chief source of family lore.
He poured green tea that he boiled on a hot plate built into the centre of his family's dinner table - a uniquely Chinese apparatus that also served as the only source of heat in their home. Nineteen others lived in the two-storey, eight-room building.
None of the money Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao spent on Guizhou appeared to have reached Wanzi.
Indeed, the drive there would have been quicker had local officials not siphoned off much of the cash they were allocated to build a four-lane highway and decided instead that the western side of the province could get by with just two lanes.
"We have too many corrupt officials. If they receive 10,000, we only receive 1,000. The poorer a place is, the more corrupt it is," said Kong Wei, a 44-year-old farmer. "We sometimes hear money is being sent, but we never receive it."
CHONGQING: POPPING CORKS AND PARTY INTRIGUE
"Put your fuckin' hands up! Put your fuckin' hands up!" Chen Qiming, a 26-year-old who performs as MC Tequila, was trying to get the crowd going on a Saturday night at Club TNT, in the Yangtze River metropolis of Chongqing, cursing at them in English and spinning pop songs that a radio listener in Canada would know well: We Are Young by the band fun., one of the most-played songs anywhere last year, merged into Bon Jovi's celebratory It's My Life .
The crowd of glitteringly dressed twentysomethings obligingly put its hands up.
Bon Jovi's ode to seizing the moment accurately captured the ethos of the crowd in Club TNT, where it cost $100 to book a table on a Saturday night, and the bottles of Moët & Chandon champagne that decorate most tables cost $200 per popped cork.
"In Chongqing's club scene right now, more and more people like to buy champagne. They want to let others know 'I'm rich, I can afford this,'" MC Tequila explained.
He said that he sings and performs in English to give the club a more "international" feel.
Despite the prices, many in the crowd were students home from university to celebrate the Lunar New Year. As they danced under a ceiling of blinking chandeliers, the revellers around me were proud that this club in middle China looked like a nightspot in Paris, London, New York or Montreal.
The students represent the positive side of China's trade-off: They have more money, and more opportunity, than any Chinese generation before them. They just want their country to be normal, and on this Saturday night in Chongqing, it very much was.
The Red Armies did not pass through Chongqing on their Long March in 1935. But in 2013, it's impossible to properly take the pulse of China without visiting the sweaty metropolis that has dominated headlines while I have been reporting from the country.
Chongqing has long been compared to Chicago, another populous river city that is considered a "heartland" place even as it is overshadowed by the political and economic capitals on the coast. But it's the Chicago of the 1920s that many see as a parallel for Chongqing - a place that gives rise to heroes and villains, provocative politicians and infamous gangsters.
At first, Bo Xilai, the high-profile Communist Party boss, came across as one of the heroes. Instead, he would become perhaps the most notorious cautionary tale of the new Chinese era.
Like Xi Jinping, Mr. Bo was a "princeling" of the party. Both their fathers had been revolutionaries who were then persecuted by Mao and finally rehabilitated by Deng Xiaoping, allowing them to protect and guide their children's careers. But that is where the similarities end.
While Mr. Xi was rising quietly through the ranks, Mr. Bo was making headlines wherever he went. After arriving as party boss of Chongqing in 2007, he launched a spectacular campaign to crush the powerful local mafia, as well as the corrupt officials who abetted them, while charting a populist leftward course economically.
Along with his cult of personality, Mr. Bo worried Chinese intellectuals with the show trials and lack of due process that were part of his anti-mafia campaign. One of his victims was Ren Jianyu, a 25-year-old civil servant whose online comments comparing Mr. Bo's tactics to Mao's.
In the summer of 2011, a team of Chongqing public-security agents went to Mr. Ren's house, and told him he needed to go to the police station.
He was sentenced to two years in a labour camp, where he was forced to work 10 hours a day welding copper rings together (he never knew why) and relearning his Communist Party history.
"I went through every feeling: pain, hate, denial," Mr. Ren recalled in an interview after his release.
Still, Mr. Bo was seen as a sure bet to join the top of China's power pyramid, the seven-man Standing Committee of the Politburo. Some predicted that he would become Mr. Xi's vice-president.
As much of the world knows, the November, 2011, death of British businessman Neil Heywood changed all that.
Mr. Bo's wife, former lawyer Gu Kailai, would confess that she came to see the family friend as a threat, invited him to a Chongqing hotel, she got him drunk and slipped him cyanide.
Ms. Gu was handed a suspended death sentence last summer. Mr. Bo was arrested on unknown charges that will almost certainly include corruption and abuse of power - an extraordinarily sensitive moment for the regime.
The irony is not lost on Mr. Ren: Mr. Bo, the man who persecuted him for speaking his mind, is now the one missing inside China's justice system. He has not been seen or heard from in a year. Unlike Mr. Ren, Mr. Bo is likely to eventually see a judge. But there's no chance that he will be found innocent.
LANZHOU: THE GHOSTS OF TIANANMEN SQUARE
From Chongqing we took a three-hour fast train west to Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province, not far from the edge of the Tibetan plateau. From there it was an epic 22-hour rumble north and west to Lanzhou, not far from the endless sands of the Gobi desert.
Lanzhou is a grim and dirty city of 3.2 million people supported by coal mines, chemical factories and, on the outskirts, a large People's Liberation Army base. To the east is the city of Huining, where Red Armies that had marched thousands of kilometres finally met up with local Communist forces. The Long March was almost over.
Because of the city's strategic location and ethnic mix - Lanzhou is a city of Han Chinese, Hui Muslims, ethnic Uyghurs (Muslims from Xinjiang province), Tibetans and Mongolians - it is also one of the most tightly controlled places in China. The few people here who spoke of politics said they longed for the freer air of Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou.
In another area, Yu Nan might have been a city councillor, but instead he lives under tight scrutiny. He agreed to meet us, but would not name a place until he was already there and convinced he had not been followed. We joined him in a curtained-off private room in a tea house near the centre of Lanzhou. Even there, Mr. Yu kept a ball cap pulled down low over his eyes.
The 45-year-old said he had first encountered the Public Security Bureau in 1989 while he was a university student in the ancient Silk Road city of Xi'an. As students took over Tiananmen Square in Beijing that spring, students in Xi'an and dozens of other cities took to the streets to show their support. Mr. Yu joined them, and emerged as one of the leaders of the democracy movement in the city.
But when the tanks and troops were sent in to crush the protests at Tiananmen - leaving hundreds of people, maybe thousands, dead - Mr. Yu and the other student leaders quickly decided that the protesters should be sent home to avoid another massacre. The leaders remained in the walled city centre to ensure that all the protesters were gone before the soldiers came.
Those who lingered were arrested. Mr. Yu spent six months packaging garlic at a re-education-through-labour camp outside the city.
Twenty-four years later, he was still being watched by the police. His more recent troubles stemmed from a 2011 effort to do something the Chinese constitution suggests he should be able to do: run for elected office. Like nearly all candidates who did not have prior Communist Party approval to run in the village elections that fall, he was thrown off the ballot on a technicality before a single vote was cast.
Mr. Yu said he knew in advance that he would never be allowed to win a spot on the village council, even though it's a nearly powerless body. His aim had been to raise awareness about how the election should have been run, and perhaps to inspire more ordinary citizens to follow his lead the next time around.
"I wanted to witness how the election went so that next time I can tutor others on the process. If there are more people involved, it will be more difficult for them to stop it," he said.
He used almost the same language I had heard a dozen times already on the journey - that all he wanted was for the Communist Party to follow its own rules: "They didn't consult us when they wrote the Constitution. At least they should respect what it says."
That is the bitter irony that is transforming China: Those who were once resigned to Communist Party rule (even some party members) now defy and mock the system.
Many see idealistic socialism being replaced by brutal every-person-for-themselves capitalism. Others, however, are connecting and trying to rebuild the fabric of a society they see as torn.
Smog city: Welcome to 'Mordor'
The day after we met Mr. Yu in the tea house, we were invited to visit Bao Xianbing, one of the more inspiring characters we encountered on our long, winding journey.
Tall, gregarious and energetic, Mr. Bao seemed the opposite of the stereotype of the Chinese civil servant. When we arrived at his office on the 14th floor of a government building near the centre of Lanzhou, he literally bounced up with excitement, pouring us tea and then refilling our paper cups faster than we could sip.
"You're my first foreign friends!" he smiled, clapping his hands together and pouring more tea.
We had come to see Mr. Bao because I was interested in Lanzhou's nascent environmental movement.
Last year, Lanzhou was named the most polluted city in China by the World Health Organization, based on the amount of particulate matter in the air. That makes it the second-most polluted place in the world, after the bicycle- and tractor-manufacturing hub of Ludhiana in northern India.
And Lanzhou seems intent on topping the next pollution chart - the city's latest expansion plan involves shaving the tops off about 700 barren mountains to create flat space for more apartment blocks and shopping malls.
The entire time we had been on the train, we had been reading and hearing of the air pollution emergency that had carpeted Beijing since we left the capital, a pall so thick and otherworldly that many residents had taken to referring to the city as Mordor, the always-dark city from The Lord of the Rings .
Fictional Mordor is home to orcs and ogres. Beijing is where my wife and asthmatic young daughter live.
Since 2008, the U.S. embassy in Beijing has been posting on Twitter its in-house evaluations of the air quality in Beijing, much to the chagrin of a Chinese government that preferred telling its citizens that it was only a thick "fog" lingering out their window.
The air quality index used by the embassy measures the amounts of ground-level ozone, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide, and plots the total amount of pollution in the air on a scale of 1 to 500, with 1 being a perfect day and anything above 300 considered "hazardous."
The scale proved to be too small to measure Beijing's air-pollution problems. In November, 2010, the AQI rating went through the roof to an unheard-of 522.
At a loss for a term that captured an AQI of 522, someone at the embassy tweeted that the air was "crazy bad," drawing a grumpy rebuke from the Chinese Foreign Ministry.
This January was even worse. The air in Beijing soared over 500 for 17 consecutive hours in Jan. 12, hitting an unimaginable 755 at one point (which a chastened U.S. embassy called only "beyond index").
The good news was that the Chinese government had by then been embarrassed into releasing its own air-quality information.
The official figure was a significantly lower 498 on the government's own scale of 500. But it was nonetheless an acknowledgment that China's growth-at-all-costs economic model had come with real and serious side effects.
Even in Lanzhou, there is a realization that something needs to change. Despite the city's repressive atmosphere, a group of about 200 concerned citizens came together in 2004 to form the first local non-governmental organization.
The oddly named Green Camel Bell environmental group started out on the city's university campuses trying to raise awareness and arranging trash-pickup days.
More recently, it joined environmental organizations in cities around China in taking independent measurements of the city's air quality and posting the information online.
Mr. Bao was this week's volunteer air tester.
"I'm a Communist Party member, if you can believe it," he told us, still grinning behind his oval spectacles and placing a device that measured air quality outside his 14th-floor window. "This is change and progress, the fact that I'm speaking out. My parents never could."
He pulled the device in and posted the result on his account on Weibo, the Chinese social-media network. It's a typically smoggy day with an air quality rating of 310, or "hazardous" on the international scale.
"Our civilization is not as good as yours," Mr. Bao sighed. "And it's getting worse, not better."
Such a public challenge to the government's grip on information has drawn the predictable reply. Mr. Bao said he was now on his fifth Weibo account after the first four were blocked.
The founders of Green Camel Bell have got used to visits from the local Public Security Bureau, although they have managed to maintain a working relationship.
It was inspiring and worrying all at the same time. I asked Mr. Bao if he wanted us to protect his name. Instead, he snapped a picture of me visiting him in his government office and posted it on his Weibo account.
"In a country with one-party rule, the reforms must come because of pressure from below, from the citizens demanding more and more," Mr. Yu, the would-be council candidate, told me. "Only when the pressure reaches the top will the leaders realize they need to do emergency surgery."
BACK TO BEIJING: ON REFORM, TALK VS. ACTION
China's new leaders say they get the message. This month, after returning from our journey, I sat under the chandeliers in the Gold Hall of the Great Hall of the People as China's new Premier, Li Keqiang, promised a "self-imposed revolution." His would be a smaller, cleaner government, he vowed.
Mr. Xi, too, has said it is time to put power in China "in a cage of regulations." But four-plus years in China have made me deeply cynical about speeches given by Communist Party leaders.
Mr. Xi's push to battle the culture of corruption within the bureaucracy seems impressive so far. Yet a quick search turns up similar speeches given by Jiang Zemin a dozen years ago, where he vowed to "curb and eliminate corruption from the root." And the labour-camp system that Mr. Xi has made a show of targeting was first declared on its way out in 2005.
Does Mr. Xi have the desire - and just as important, the power - to make real changes?
He has more control than his more recent predecessors, Hu Jintao and Jiang Zemin, in large part because he has spent much of his career forging links to the leadership of the powerful People's Liberation Army.
In addition to being head of the government and the Communist Party, Mr. Xi is chairman of the Central Military Commission, giving him immediate control over the three institutions that matter most in the People's Republic.
But he rose to the top largely because he was a well-liked compromise candidate, and is only first-among-equals on the seven-man Standing Committee of the Politburo, the group that collectively governs China. The majority of the rest of the committee are seen as conservatives resistant to major reforms.
One touchstone for my understanding of China has been Bao Tong, who was once the top adviser to another general secretary of the Communist Party, Zhao Ziyang, before both men were purged for siding with the students on Tiananmen Square.
Twenty-four years later, Mr. Bao still lives under loose house arrest at his apartment in Beijing. But he is one of the few people who truly know the workings of power in China who will discuss the topic with a foreign journalist.
Visiting him means running through the same surveillance gauntlet we had avoided in Lanzhou. Plainclothes security men photographed John and me as soon as our car pulled up in front of the apartment block in west Beijing.
In the lobby of the building, two more officers - one uniformed, one not - asked to see our identification, scribbling the information into a giant book.
Only then was Mr. Bao, a rail-thin and eternally cheerful 80-year-old, allowed to take us up to his apartment. "They don't do this for the other apartments," he smiled sadly.
Upstairs, in a narrow living room lined with books, Mr. Bao was cautiously optimistic about Mr. Xi, but worried he would be constrained by the same system that elevated him.
But he placed some hope in Mr. Xi because his father, Xi Zhongxun, was always willing to push against the grain.
There are two stories whispered around Beijing: One is that the elder Mr. Xi wore a watch given to him by the Dalai Lama long after it was politically smart to be associated with the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader. The other is that he was one of very few senior members of the Communist Party who criticized the decision to use force on Tiananmen Square.
Mr. Bao cannot confirm that anecdote - he was incarcerated by then - but he does not think that it would have been out of character. "Xi's father had great integrity. He was very clear about what is right and what is wrong, and very brave in expressing what he was thinking. I hope that the son inherited some of his merits," he said.
I asked what advice he would give to Mr. Xi if the new leader unexpectedly sought it. Mr. Bao took a long pull on one of the cigarettes constantly in his mouth before answering.
"I would tell him to work according to the laws of China," he said, referring to a post-Mao Constitution that was passed in 1982, guaranteeing rights such as freedom of speech, freedom of assembly and the ownership of private property, protections that remain only theoretical three decades later.
"Even if the laws are uncom-fortable, they should follow them."
The measure of Mr. Xi
Back in Liangjiahe, where our trip ended, residents were also waiting for Mr. Xi to reveal himself, to show them a sign that he remembered the time he spent there.
Was his fast start - the more open leadership style, the crackdown on corruption, the noises about dismantling the labour-camp system - a sign that he intended to repair China's broken system of governance? Or was he just another apparatchik like Hu Jintao before him?
My trip convinced me that China is going to change dramatically over the coming decade. It is up to the Communist Party - especially Mr. Xi - to decide whether it wants to lead that change or dig in for an existential crisis.
The People's Republic must redefine itself, or risk being pulled down by its people.
As we chatted with Mr. Wang, the old man who had worked alongside Mr. Xi on the village dike four decades ago, the Liangjiahe party secretary finally had emerged into the courtyard, surrounded by perhaps a dozen similarly dressed men.
They walked briskly past us without acknowledging us or our shouted attempts to get their attention. They all stared down at their feet or up at the elm trees that winter had stripped of leaves.
It was as if they were pretending they had not seen us. It was as if the old strictures - the ones that applied under Hu Jintao - no longer applied, and no one yet knew what the new rules were.
We were free to go. And for the moment, anyway, it felt like something had changed.

Full text:   As the U.S. Supreme Court hears two landmark cases this week, Kathryn Blaze Carlson looks at the cases, the justices - and the impact the ruling could have on American society
THE CASES
Ten years to the day after the U.S. Supreme Court took up a challenge to Texas's anti-sodomy statute, the court heard arguments for one of two same-sex marriage cases that could change the course of gay rights at a time when public opinion is shifting fast. The justices will take up the second case Wednesday.
Proposition 8: Officially known as Hollingsworth v. Perry, this case takes on Proposition 8, a 2008 California ballot initiative banning gay marriage. Berkeley couple Kris Perry and Sandy Stier, as well as Burbank's Paul Katami and Jeff Zarrillo, agreed to be the named plaintiffs challenging Prop. 8, while Dennis Hollingsworth, a former Republican senator, represents Californians who argue the ban should stand. It has been a winding road: Since 2004, California issued 18,000 marriage licences for gay couples, the state Supreme Court invalidated those unions but then years later changed its mind and said the practice should be allowed; then California voters struck down gay marriage by voting "yes" to Prop. 8. Former California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and current Governor Jerry Brown declined to defend the ban, which is why a private citizen, Mr. Hollingsworth, has taken up the cause.
Defence of Marriage Act: Wednesday marks the first time the Supreme Court will hear a challenge to the 1996 Defence of Marriage Act, or DOMA, which came into force under former president Bill Clinton (who, along with his wife and potential 2016 presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, has since come out in favour of same-sex marriage). The law blocks same-sex couples from receiving federal benefits that heterosexual couples enjoy. The lead plaintiff in this case is 83-year-old Edie Windsor, who paid $363,000 in federal estate taxes after her partner of 40 years died in 2009. Had Ms. Windsor been male, no such taxes would have been due.
THE JUSTICES
Four Supreme Court justices - Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor - are considered reliably liberal, while four others - Chief Justice John Roberts, Antonin Scalia, Samuel Alito, and Clarence Thomas - lean conservative. That seems to leave Justice Anthony Kennedy, a California native, as the swing vote. But Chief Justice Roberts is also unpredictable and therefore one to watch: Last year, he voted to uphold most of the Obama adminstration's Affordable Care Act, preserving the Democratic President's signature legislation.
DAY ONE
Over the course of 80 minutes of arguments on the Prop. 8 case on Tuesday, the Supreme Court justices saddled lawyers on both sides with a flurry of questions and signalled skepticism over whether now is the time to hear the case and, significantly, whether the court should decide on gay marriage in the first place.
"Why is taking a case now the answer?" Justice Sotomayor asked, while Justice Kennedy stated, "I just wonder if this case was properly granted."
Justice Kennedy, the supposed swing vote, expressed sympathy for the 40,000 children of gay mothers and fathers who "want their parents to have full recognition and full status," but he also lamented uncertainty about the societal consequences of same-sex marriage. As Justice Alito put it: "You want us to step in and assess the effects of this institution, which is newer than cellphones and/or the Internet?"
Lawyer Charles Cooper, who is arguing in favour of the ban, fielded tough questions over how exactly gay marriage harms traditional marriage. To that, Mr. Cooper said the state has an interest in procreation (to which another judge asked about the rights, then, of sterile heterosexual couples). The lawyer challenging the ban, Theodore Olson, struck back at Justice Kennedy's comment that throwing out California's ban would take the Supreme Court into "uncharted waters," saying the court had been down this road once before, back in 1967 on interracial marriages.
THE SCENE
Hundreds, if not thousands of gay-marriage proponents and opponents descended upon the sidewalks outside the court. They carried signs that read, "Marriage Is A Constitutional Right," "'I Do' Support Marriage Equality," "Kids Do Best With A Mom And A Dad," and "My Sister And I Want Our Moms To Marry." Some demonstrators had waited in line since Thursday to obtain a coveted seat to hear the historic argument. Rob Reiner, the actor and director who helped lead the charge against the California ban, was at the front of the line by Tuesday morning. But those with money and no time to spare opted for a different solution: Several Washington companies charged upwards of $50 an hour to wait in line for a yellow card entitling customers to a three-minute viewing. The cost of lining up since Thursday? Somewhere around $6,000.
POSSIBLE DECISIONS
The court, which is expected to issue decisions on both cases in late June, could decide on Prop. 8 and DOMA in a number of ways that bear varying degrees of impact.
On Proposition 8:
1. Same-sex marriage is a constitutional right. State bans must be overturned and gay couples across the nation must be allowed to wed. This is the most dramatic outcome and would echo a sweeping 1967 ruling that invalidated state bans on interracial marriage.
2. Gay marriage is not constitutionally protected so the court has no reason to overturn either Prop. 8 or any other state bans. This would please the lawyers arguing in favour of Prop. 8, since they argue the court should not override the democratic process by redefining marriage in some 40 states that do not allow same-sex couples to wed.
3. The California ban is not only struck down, but states that currently recognize same-sex unions or domestic partnerships must also allow gays and lesbians to marry. This would affect eight states, besides California, that recognize civil unions (Colorado, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Nevada, New Jersey, Oregon and Rhode Island). This is the Obama administration's preferred outcome - in fact, the White House sent a solicitor-general to the Supreme Court to present 10 minutes of arguments against Prop. 8.
4. Same-sex marriage is allowed in California.
5. Mr. Hollingsworth - a private citizen, and not the governor or attorney-general - has no standing so the case has no business being before the judges. Hollingsworth v. Perry, then, is thrown out altogether.
On DOMA: 1. The legislation is unconstitutional since it denies equal rights. Federal benefits, then, should flow to same-sex couples. Ms. Windsor would get a $363,000 refund.
2. The act is constitutional and the traditional definition of marriage is upheld. Federal benefits continue to flow to heterosexual couples only.
3. The court cannot weigh in because Congress, which brought the case before the justices after the U.S. Justice Department opted not to challenge an appeal court ruling that deemed DOMA unconstitutional, has no standing.

DUELLING LAWYERS
The high-profile case against Proposition 8 has brought together two onetime Supreme Court opponents. Republican Theodore Olson and Democrat David Boies are leading the legal team representing the same-sex couples. They argued against each other in the Bush v. Gore case that settled the disputed 2000 presidential election in favour of George W. Bush.
Opposing them is Charles Cooper, who was Mr. Olson's colleague at the Justice Department during the Reagan administration.
49 / The percentage of Americans who now favour allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally, according to a Pew Research Center poll conducted in mid-March. Forty-four per cent are opposed.

The Globe asked expat Canadians to share their views on same-sex marriage and how the issue resonates in their community
These opinions come from a group of Canadians now living in the United States who were part of The Globe's expat project during the U.S. election.
Having lived in Augusta, Ga., for three years, I have been working on my faith in other humans that when they encounter me, or me with my partner Jessica, that they will treat us with as equal respect and dignity as everyone else.
What I have found by being open, and coming out to co-workers, friends, and even strangers, is that most of the time, people are either vocally supportive or just treat us the same as everybody else. The number of times that we have been stared at or made under the breath disparaging comments against is actually quite minimal. I think this says a lot for the South, and for the possibility of a real shift in mentality around it.
Leah Taylor from Woodville, Ont., is now living in Augusta, Ga.
When I lived in Canada, I thought then, as I think now, that the most effective public policy solution would be to separate civil marriage and religious marriage. But I haven't seen any political will to do that in any government anywhere.
I'm actually a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (also known as Mormons). Our doctrine is that same-sex marriage is not part of God's plan. And that came to the fore in 2008, when many members of the church in California and elsewhere, participated in the Prop. 8 campaign. I moved to California just a week before the election, but I confess, had I been there earlier, and had I been in the church meetings where people were signing up volunteers to wave signs on street corners and donate to the campaign, I would have been very uncomfortable.
You see, many members of my extended family are gay or lesbian. At least one died in the initial AIDS epidemic; another was "gay-bashed" to death. And all of them are just people to me.
Our societies, in both the U.S. and Canada, are pluralistic democracies, with freedom of religion. That means that while I and many others may think that God is of one mind regarding this matter, we cannot and should not impose our views on those who either think God is of another mind, or who don't believe in God at all. I am fully in favour of implementing same-sex marriage here in the U.S., and I hope the Supreme Court decides accordingly.
Robert Slaven from Yellowknife is now living in Phoenix. We're ground zero for this fight. My wife works with one of the Prop. 8 plaintiffs at a local health club. I've got almost as many gay friends as straight ones, some are married, some are divorced, some are looking for Mr. Right and some are looking for Mr. Right Now. They're all awesome and infuriating and weird and talented and deserving of respect and all those crazy civil rights we take for granted - just like my straight friends.
Yes, more people voted for Prop. 8 than against. Take that vote again today, I think we'd have a different result. The idea of gay marriage just seems so normal it's shocking when you run into anyone who doesn't support it.
Collin Friesen from Winnipeg is now living in Los Angeles I live in Washington, D.C., in a vibrant, diverse community and part of the city where, should I venture a guess, the vast majority of our community would hold very similar views on a whole range of social issues, including respect for same-sex marriage rights, equality, and likely even political affiliation. That said, there have been reports of hate crimes and homophobic slurs in recent years, and the gravity of these incidents and the discrimination that still exists, even in a relatively progressive part of the city, cannot be ignored.
I do, however, feel that in my circle of neighbours, friends and community, my family exists in a little bubble. We take for granted that everyone we come into contact with shares our views on equality and same-sex marriage rights, and as a Canadian, I am heartened that this is an issue that we all stand behind and support. On this issue, my world in Washington, D.C., very closely resembles my reality of community in Toronto. When I leave our safe bubble, however, I am struck by the fact that while intolerance and homophobia are fortunately the exception in my neighbourhood, this is most certainly not the case in many other parts of the United States, and often just a few miles away from our neighbourhood. Thankfully, as the intolerance is starting to die off, it seems as though my "bubble" is fast becoming the norm.
Jennifer Khurana from Toronto is now living in Washington, D.C. I have always been a supporter of same-sex marriage - I know this is from my Canadian heritage as well as from growing up in a family that promoted social equality. While it can be disheartening to hear opposing views about equality, I am glad to see that same-sex marriage is gaining momentum. I never understood why others care so much that gay and lesbian couples want to marry. If you don't support it, don't do it. But why care if people you don't even know get married?
Massachusetts, where I live, was the first U.S. state to legalize same-sex marriage. I live in a particularly liberal area of the state so there isn't much hubbub about it. We just hope the momentum continues and that whoever wants to get married can go ahead and do it.
Interestingly, while same-sex marriage is gaining momentum, to many people, traditional marriage is almost becoming passé. Many common-law couples that I know debate whether they should get married or happily remain common-law. The key is choice, though. In my opinion, everyone should be able to choose to marry their partner or not, based on what is right for them.
Colleen Pendergast from Edmonton is now living in Nantucket, Mass. The area I live in is pretty diverse - the state's capital is here, there are universities around and a very large rural component. The voting population typically elects members of the GOP. I don't think it would be unfair to say this part of the state is mainly conservative with a significant middle-of-the-road component.
That being said, the general philosophy tends to be - "I'm not going to get into your business, so don't get into mine." However, the fact is that Pennsylvania bans same-sex marriage and has no state laws mandating the protection of the LGBT community.
My personal experience has been that people generally shrug their shoulders and say something like, "It doesn't affect me so I don't care."
Brian Monkman from Oakville, Ont., is now living in Mechanicsburg, Penn.

Full text:   These people are the real players in Canadian sports. They are the top movers and shakers in their fields, whether as athletes or behind the scenes. They determine what we see, who we cheer for, what we should think about and how much we pay. This is The Globe and Mail's annual look at who's the boss
He was, for the full run of the NHL lockout, public enemy No. 1 in Canada - commissioner Gary Bettman, presiding over yet another work stoppage, the third of his 20 years on the job. In every imaginable forum - public-opinion polls, website chat boards, veiled threats to cancel contracts from sponsors - there seemed to be a clear, undeniable message: That this time, Bettman's willingness to suspend NHL games until he could wring more concessions from the NHL Players' Association may have gone too far. This time, he may have tested the viewing public's patience once too often - and that when the labour dispute was eventually resolved, there would be a backlash.
But as an executive, Bettman is nothing if not stubbornly convinced of the rightness of his own position - and he was convinced that the NHL's ultra-loyal fans would return, no matter what.
Now, some two-thirds of the way through the lockout-shortened 48-game season, it looks as though he will be proved right.
The industry has emerged from the disruption barely bruised. Fans flocked back in their usual numbers, television ratings soared and the outlook remains promising.
It is Bettman's involvement in the lockout - and its eventual resolution - plus a laundry list of the things that remain on his personal to-do list in its aftermath that put him into the No.1 spot on The Globe And Mail's annual list of the Power 50.
Bettman knocked Donald Fehr, last year's winner, out of the top spot, largely because he will be front and centre in the one conversation that will drive the Canadian sports agenda for the rest of 2013, namely, is the NHL going to Sochi to participate in the 2014 Olympics, and if so, how will Canada's men's team look?
Since the lockout ended, negotiations among the NHL, the International Olympic Committee and the International Ice Hockey Federation have been ongoing, but with the Games less than a year away, no formal commitment has been made.
This, of course, falls into the Bettman playbook quite nicely. Bettman is like a poker player. The art of negotiating - playing the negotiating game - is what drives him.
He doesn't mind going down to the wire in any talks in order to extract the best possible deal for the NHL, which is what's happening with the Olympic talks now, too. Bettman wants a better deal for his league - improved access for his owners and his general managers; and the right to use images from Olympic competition in the NHL's own marketing ventures. He will press for these concessions, until such as time as the IOC relents, and Bettman's history - the only commissioner to cancel a full season - suggests that he's fully capable of walking away, if he doesn't get what he wants.
Bettman's workload hasn't shrunk much, in the two-plus months since the lockout ended. Since then, he has already overseen an ambitious realignment project under which the Winnipeg Jets play in a geographically more sensible location next season - moving from the Southeast Division to the as-yet-unnamed Midwest Division, while the Detroit Red Wings and the Columbus Blue Jackets move east.
The league still needs to resolve the Coyotes future in Phoenix, a thorn in Bettman's side for the past three seasons, or since the NHL took over operations of the franchise from former owner Jerry Moyes. He is also consistently about stability, which is why his persistence in trying to keep the Coyotes in Phoenix shouldn't be a surprise. He was that way with Pittsburgh (when Jim Balsillie was trying to buy the club) and as far back as the late 1990s, was that way with Edmonton, too.
The new collective agreement is essentially still just a memorandum of understanding, full of loose threads that need to be tied together. There are also a series of new owner-player committees that will focus on a broad range of topics, including player-safety initiatives and increasing the NHL's visibility abroad. The Winter Classic needs to be reaffirmed, another Heritage Classic is likely coming to Canada next year and Columbus, which had the all-star game cancelled this season because of the labour dispute, is owed a game somewhere down the road.
Then there is the matter of negotiating a new agreement for Canadian television rights, after coming to terms with NBC and its affiliated networks for a record $2-billion pact for U.S. rights.
Busy, busy, busy, but as Bettman noted on the day the realignment puzzle was solved, he - and the league - are noted for juggling multiple initiatives.
"I know there's this quaint notion that we only focus on one thing at a time," Bettman said. "We're actually pretty good at multitasking. ... We have to do a number of things at the same time."
It is why, despite the fact that he is generally considered an unpopular choice to lead the NHL by many of the people who watch it, Bettman received a contract extension in November of 2011 and freely admits that he has no interest in going anywhere or doing anything but lead the NHL for the foreseeable future. Like him or not, Bettman is going to be around for a while yet.

1. Gary Bettman He went to the wall in the NHL lockout, he'll determine the league's participation in the Sochi Games and he's solidly in charge of Canada's game for as long as he wants to be
2 George Cope, Nadir Mohamed
As the bosses of the companies that are majority co-owners of Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment, firing GM Brian Burke was their first salvo in resurrecting the Leafs. Cope, with BCE, and Mohamed, with Rogers, run the most influential brand in Canada, but face big challenges in also turning the Raptors and Toronto FC into winners. Who they hire and how they conduct business as owners and broadcast partners will have an impact on Canadian communications and sports for the next decade.
3 Marcel Aubut
The Canadian Olympic Committee president will try to generate attention and sponsorships for amateur athletes heading into the 2014 Sochi Olympics. A major coup would be another big fish in the private sector: the COC recently announced an eight-year partnership with Canadian Tire Co. Ltd, which joined The Royal Bank of Canada, Hudson's Bay Co. and Bell as a premier COC sponsor.
4 Paul Beeston, Alex Anthopoulos
On the road to nowhere in the tough AL East division, the Blue Jays could have hacked payroll one more time in the name of building up the farm system and making a small profit. Instead, the pair of Canadian executives operating the team decided the time was right to go for the club's first title since 1993. Beeston convinced the Rogers board of directors that the time was right to spend on payroll, and Anthopoulos started his offseason shopping spree by executing a 12-player blockbuster deal with Miami to land a pair of starting pitchers, Josh Johnson and Mark Buehrle, one of the top shortstops in baseball in Jose Reyes, and a utility player, Emilio Bonifacio. Anthopoulos signed left fielder Melky Cabrera as a free agent despite his suspension for use of a performance-enhancing drugs, and topped it off by trading a pair of top prospects for R.A. Dickey, the knuckleball-throwing ace of the New York Mets. With a payroll hiked by more than $35-million (U.S.), the Blue Jays believe they have the potential of capturing the country's attention this season. Oh, and the Rogers' channel Sportsnet has exclusive rights to their games.
5 Mark Cohon
As CFL commissioner, Cohon has built attendance and sponsorship revenue for the league. With TV ratings holding, he successfully negotiated the league's new broadcast deal with TSN and RDS this year, extending it to 2018.
6 Keith Pelley
The president of Rogers Media must create a viable new broadcast concept with newly acquired The Score. He also has to create a national TV network using Citytv and other local and regional channels so he can be in the discussion for television rights to the NHL.
7 Ken Dryden, Barbara Csenge
Concussion doctors and experts have spurred the campaign to bring awareness of the traumatic effects of head injuries to athletes and the public, but the former Hall of Fame goaltender has led the charge that includes an ever-growing number of doctors around the world. For her part, Csenge, the director of learning enrichment at St. Michael's College School in Toronto, has helped pioneer a system for helping young athletes return to class after suffering a concussion on the field.
8 Sidney Crosby
The Pittsburgh Penguins captain remains the most marketable player in hockey, and for better or worse, is also the poster boy for the effects of concussion treatment and recovery. He'll likely be captain of Canada's Olympic men's hockey team in Sochi in 2014 as it defends its gold medal.
9 Murray Edwards
Edwards is part owner of the Calgary Flames, a member of the NHL's executive committee and was a key hawk in the collective bargaining. Now that labour talks are over, Edwards will not be nearly as visible, but he still exerts considerable influence at governors' level.
10 Kirstine Stewart
The executive vice-president of CBC's English Services, CBC/Radio-Canada now owns the Olympic brand through 2016. But can a non-sports executive hang onto the iconic Hockey Night in Canada brand for the network with less money than the competition? Stewart has hired plenty of suits to help her but she will take the bow or the fall on this one.
11 Pierre Karl Peladeau
In 2012, the telecom magnate set up an all-sports television cable network that started hoovering up properties from MLS to boxing. In 2013, he has stepped aside from day-to-day management as CEO of Quebecor to concentrate on his plan to attract an NHL team for Quebec City.
12 Phil King
As president of CTV programming and sports, King runs the most profitable TV sports speciality channel with the best properties. He renegotiated with the CFL and is now preparing for NHL national rights negotiations for the fall of 2014. If he gets them, he could be the king of the castle.
13 Steve Yzerman
He is the general manager of Canada's 2014 men's Olympic hockey team and, assuming NHL participation in Sochi is confirmed, will be the man with the envelope next December, unveiling 23 names of Canadian men's players who will try to defend Canada's gold medal in Vancouver.
14 John Collins
Now that Gary Bettman has led the league through another bruising lockout, it will be Collins's job to rebuild the shield with disaffected corporate sponsors and broadcasters. The architect of the Winter Classic, Collins, the chief operating officer of the NHL, will need all his skills to restore the roar.
15 Georges St. Pierre
No one has done more to raise the profile of mixed martial arts in this country. After sitting out most of 2012 with a career-threatening knee injury, he returned to defend his title as UFC welterweight champion, and recently did so again - his 11th successive victory. He is one of Canada's few bona fide international superstars, and has global reach.
16 Mark Chipman, David Thomson
The chairman of the Winnipeg Jets and owner of True North Sports and Entertainment, in partnership with Thomson, Chipman has been an increasingly important voice at the NHL's board of governors level and was involved in both collective bargaining and realignment talks. The love affair with the Jets in Winnipeg, now almost two years old, shows little sign of waning. And the Jets are threatening to make the playoffs.
17 Christine Sinclair
Canada's face of the 2012 London Olympics will turn 30 in June and is positioned to lead the side into the 2015 women's World Cup, which will be in Canada. Sinclair, captain of the Canadian women's soccer team, won the Lou Marsh Trophy as Canada's athlete of the year and the Bobbie Rosenfeld award as Canada's female athlete of the year.
18 Bonnie Brooks, Gordon Nixon, Stephen Wetmore
Each of these CEOs heads up a premier sponsor of the Canadian Olympic Committee, so expect a huge marketing push from each company as momentum builds for Sochi. Brooks, of Hudson's Bay Co., Royal Bank of Canada's Nixon and BCE's George Cope have been on board for previous Games, while Wetmore's Canadian Tire Co. Ltd. joined the tiny clan earlier this year.
19 Peter Sisam
The vice-president of IMG Canada is also a veteran negotiator of broadcasting rights for sports. He should be instrumental in brokering new Canadian NHL broadcasting rights, which are up for renewal in 2014. If a revamped Rogers arrives at the table, it could go toe-to-toe with TSN and CBC.
20 Daryl Katz
The drugstore billionaire and Edmonton Oilers owner threatened to move the team to Seattle. Now, he's finally close to a deal for a new arena that will cost $600-million. And the savvy businessman managed to structure a deal where his upfront costs are nominal.
21 Peter Swinburn
The CEO of Molson Coors runs one of the best-known brands in Canada, not to mention his involvement with one of the NHL's biggest sponsors, and he's not afraid to throw his weight around. He expressed his displeasure over lost revenues in beer sales caused by the lockout. Now that hockey's back, how many sponsorship dollars he returns with will be crucial to NHL teams.
22 David Branch
The commissioner of the Ontario Hockey League and president of the Canadian Hockey League has led efforts to ban head shots in part by handing out some of the most severe suspensions in the history of organized hockey. Branch also introduced a new rule for this season that calls for suspensions should a player engage in more than 10 fights.
23 Richard Waugh
From hockey to football to marathons, Scotiabank is one of the biggest sponsors of sporting events in the country. As the bank's chief executive officer, Waugh's support of everything from the Grey Cup to Toronto Waterfront Marathon is crucial to their operations.
24 Geoff Molson
In the post-lockout era, the Montreal Canadiens' owner is aggressively tending to the Habs, since they bestride all other sports in Quebec. Molson is leveraging the brand into real estate developments, and ground will shortly be broken on a 10,000-seat arena in Laval, Que., which will be managed by the Habs consortium's concert promotion arm. The team opened with a bang this season.
25 Carol Huynh
The two-time Olympic medalist is fighting to save her sport from being tossed from the Olympics. The new chair of Wrestling Canada's Olympic Wrestling 2020 and Beyond committee will lobby IOC members to vote against the recommendation of the IOC executive committee to remove wrestling from the core Olympic program. The vote is this fall.
26 Dave Nonis
By virtue of the portfolio (Toronto Maple Leafs GM) and how he got it - handed to him, days after the lockout ended - his every move will be scrutinized, internally by his overlords, externally by the varied members of Leaf Nation, to see if he can once and for all get the team with the longest playoff drought into the post-season.
27 Ann Merklinger
As CEO of Own the Podium, Merklinger is charged with overseeing the effort to produce more World Cup and world championship medals and turn them into Olympic medals in Sochi. To help ensure that, OTP is now investing more heavily in sports with medal potential for future Olympics. Merklinger lost her winter accomplice when Ken Read, who directed OTP's winter program, stepped down in March. The search is under way for his replacement.
28 Clara Hughes
Canada's greatest female Olympian retired from competition after the London Games, but the six-time Olympic medalist's advocacy work on depression and mental health and her involvement on the international advisory board of Right to Play mean her influence hasn't waned. If anything, it's grown.
29 Steve Podborski
The first North American man to win an Olympic medal in downhill skiing (a bronze in 1980) now leads Canada into its first Winter Games after 14 golds in Vancouver 2010. As the chef de mission for the Canadian Olympic team in Sochi, the former Crazy Canuck will be ramping up his appearances on behalf of Canada's Olympic hopefuls.
30 Don Cherry
The CBC has doubled down on the Hockey Night in Canada host, seeing him as a meal ticket. This could be his last 18 months on air, however, depending on how negotiations go for CBC in NHL rights discussions.
31 Joey Votto
The Canadian first baseman has one of the longest guaranteed contracts in the history of major league baseball, so it was big news when he donned Canada's uniform at the World Baseball Classic (even if team did fizzle.) Now the 2010 National League MVP just has to keep proving he's worth his whopping $225-million, 12-year contract with the Cincinnati Reds.
32 Don Fehr
The executive director of the NHL Players' Association proved to be a formidable foe to Gary Bettman and the owners during the lockout. Fehr's ability to explain complex legal and labour issues in layman's terms meant the players never wavered in their support, which resulted in significant gains. Now, like Bettman, Fehr's most immediate task is to keep the players in the Olympics but on more favourable terms than the past.
33 Milos Raonic
Raonic has a chance to do for tennis what Mike Weir did for golf and expand the audience for the sport by steadily climbing up the players' ranks. He made it to round of 16 in first major of the season and has now ditched his Lacoste sponsorship deal for a partnership with the mainstream shoe company, New Balance.
34 Blue Jays starters
Led by Ricky Romero as the de-facto ace coming out of spring training in 2012, the Blue Jays starting pitchers were among the worst in baseball. Anthopolous addressed the situation by assembling an eclectic group. R.A. Dickey, the National League Cy Young Award winner, throws a hard knuckleball. Josh Johnson is a tall, power-pitching right-hander who came from the Miami Marlins with Mark Buehrle, a no-nonsense quick working left-hander who relies on speed changes and acute location to retire batters. Brandon Morrow and Romero are the holdovers, though Romero as the fifth starter is being pushed in spring training by J.A. Happ, a lefty obtained last July.
35 Bryan Colangelo
Heading into this NBA season, the president and GM of the Toronto Raptors was counting on a competitive year from his team that would help convince his bosses at MLSE to pick up the option clause on his contract that would bring him back for at least another year. A 4-19 start to the season kind of put the kibosh on that. And with the Raptors now heading for a fifth consecutive season without a playoff appearance Colangelo's continued presence as the man in charge will undoubtedly be a major topic of discussion within the conglomerate's executive offices.
36 Pat Brisson, J.P. Barry
Agents Brisson and Barry (his partner), control arguably the best stable of players in the NHL. Their star, Sidney Crosby, is still the most marketable athlete in the league, and now that he is fully recovered from his concussion problems he is having a monster season that will only increase his fame and influence.
37 Bob Nicholson
He's the president and CEO of Hockey Canada, an organization that runs the cash-generating world junior championship among other events. A supporter of Olympic participation, Nicholson has been making a compelling case to the NHL to suspend play for 20 days in 2014 so the league's best can go to Sochi. Negotiations are under way.
38 Mike Gillis
In his fifth season as president of the Canucks, with a five-year extension set to start for next season, Gillis looks as though he'll get tenure that other GMs dream of. But it feels as though the one-time player agent is on a precipice, with his team struggling and his stars aging. Skeptics abound. And he hasn't been able to trade Roberto Luongo, demanding a high price and getting nothing back, as yet.
39 Christiane Ayotte
As head of the WADA-approved anti-doping lab, Ayotte has played an instrumental role in unmasking drug cheats at multiple Olympic Games and in several professional sports. The doctor is an internationally recognized authority on illegal doping in high-performance sport.
40 Ryder Hesjedal
Last year, the native of Victoria, B.C., native did what no Canadian has done before in cycling, win a grand tour in Europe, the Giro d'Italia. He aims to repeat in 2013 - and carry on to the Tour de France, where he crashed last year but finished a tantalizing sixth in 2010, best yet for a Canadian.
41 Joey Saputo, Kevin Payne, Greg Kerfoot
Of the three leaders of the country's Major League Soccer franchises, Toronto FC's Payne has the toughest row to hoe: a team loaded with financial resources but historically shy on brains. Kerfoot's Vancouver Whitecaps have quickly usurped TFC as the country's premier franchise, while Saputo's Montreal Impact are 4-0 in their second season and have some name players - Alessandro Nesta and Matteo Ferrari - who are familiar to fans of the beautiful game. TFC deserves kudos, however, for the academy setup. Canada punches under its weight in international men's soccer; these three men can do a great deal about it. Kerfoot has been one of the sport's foremost benefactors in Canada.
42 Francesco Aquilini
The scion of a local construction and real estate fortune and a billionaire family, Aquilini has made unconventional choices in his decade as owner of the Vancouver Canucks. But he's been in a bunch of scraps of late. The team is not its former self. There's a nasty, and public, divorce with his ex-wife. There's a lawsuit from a famous Italian sports psychologist over a botched work permit. And he's heavily backed B.C. Premier Christy Clark, who looks as though she'll lose the spring election.
43 Jeff Hunt
Hunt will oversee the implementation of the CFL's newest franchise in Ottawa as president of Ottawa Sports and Entertainment Group, which owns the expansion team. Hunt is a Canadian businessman who currently owns the Ottawa 67's hockey club of the OHL.
44 Susan Cohig
As the NHL's senior vice-president of integrated marketing, Cohig deals with the NHL's corporate partners. Her biggest job now will be keeping them happy after a tough revenue drought during the lockout. Cohig also manages the NHL's club services, working with each team in the league on its sales and marketing.
45 Wayne Gretzky
The Great One still holds all the records, and when he speaks about the game everyone listens. The slightest rumour about him going to Toronto or any other major NHL city can make the Internet explode.
46 Kimberley Amirault-Ryan
Amirault-Ryan was Canada's head of sport psychology for the 2010 and 2012 Olympics and will continue in this role for the 2014 Games. She has also worked with a number of NHL and NBA teams: she was the first female performance consultant to work with the New York Rangers and New York Knicks, and has since worked with the Columbus Blue Jackets and most recently the Edmonton Oilers.
47 Gerry Frappier
Yes, it has given up the Olympics to Radio-Canada, but RDS - where Frappier is president - is still the dominant player in the sports broadcasting industry in Quebec, given it holds the rights to the Canadiens.
48 Rebecca Marino
The 22-year-old retired from professional tennis this year, and, in doing so, spoke openly for the first time about her struggles with depression, joining a growing list of athletes and high-profile Canadians who are turning a spotlight on the illness and helping to diffuse the stigma surrounding it. She reached her highest WTA ranking - 38th - in 2011.
49 David Braley
The senator owns the Toronto Argonauts and the B.C. Lions, who will be host of the 2014 Grey Cup. The Argos are in the process of re-negotiating their lease at Rogers Centre and are not planning on going anywhere for the next five years or so, although they are exploring options.
50 Andrew Wiggins
The teen basketball phenom is considered North America's top high school basketball recruit in the class of 2013. A native of Thornhill, Ont., and the son of former NBA player Mitchell Wiggins and track and field star Marita Payne, he could be the best Canadian NBA player since Steve Nash.

CORRECTION: A Tuesday Sports story on the power of 50 incorrectly referred to Ryder Hesjedal as having the best result for a Canadian in the Tour de France. While Mr. Hesjedal finished sixth in 2012, Steve Bauer had a better result finishing fourth in 1988.

Abstract: "It's totally abuzz here during the comedy festival," says Melbourne comic Steele Saunders, a performer at this year's event, which runs from March 27 to April 21. "Almost every concert hall and broom closet is transformed into a venue and the city is bursting with comedy. I'm not joking about the broom closet either - it's a pretty good venue."

Full text:   I hate travelling in summer. Overpriced airfares, hordes of vacationing kids and sizzling cities that don't do air conditioning are all reasons to stay home when the mercury rises. Besides, I've had some of my most memorable jaunts in spring: The weather is pleasant, the price is right and there's often either a great festival on or it feels like you've got the whole place to yourself. Here are five destinations that are at the top of their game around April - with tips from the locals (and me) on why it's time to start packing
concierge@globeandmail.com
SEVILLE
"Spring here is like a pleasant summer elsewhere: Hot enough to wear sandals and sit outside on restaurant terraces, but without the killer heat," says Shawn Hennessey (azahar-sevilla.com), a blogger and foodie tour guide who's lived in Spain's fourth-largest city since 1993.
She loves the region's spring flowers - "it's orange blossom time and for a few weeks it smells like heaven" - but the main lure for many is the six-day Feria de Abril, Andalusia's biggest Flamenco-flavoured festival.
"It's a massive party with horses and carriages and lots of drinking and dancing. Most of the casetas [small marquees] are private, but you can also find public ones and just enjoy strolling the fairground." Wine, sherry and an abundance of tasty tapas are ever-present.
If you can't make it to this year's Feria - starting April 16 - Seville offers plenty of other reasons to book a spring getaway, from exploring old town streets to Cadiz coastal day trips. "In spring, its important to spend as much time outdoors here as you can," Hennessey says.
Eat: La Azotea, for gourmet tapas and great wines by the glass in a modern setting (laazoteasevilla.es).
Stay: Hotel Casa 1800 is a lovely boutique property with richly decorated rooms, some with private terrace Jacuzzis (hotelcasa1800.com).
Tip: Take one of Hennessey's tapas tasting tours for an insider's perspective on Seville's best dining (azahar-sevilla.com/tapas-tours).
MELBOURNE
"It's totally abuzz here during the comedy festival," says Melbourne comic Steele Saunders, a performer at this year's event, which runs from March 27 to April 21. "Almost every concert hall and broom closet is transformed into a venue and the city is bursting with comedy. I'm not joking about the broom closet either - it's a pretty good venue."
But don't limit yourself to acts you've heard of, he says. "Pick a name you know, then take a risk on a lesser-known name - be adventurous." He suggests heading to Melbourne Town Hall where acts gather outside to paper passersby with their flyers. "You'll quickly work out who you want to spend the next 50 minutes with."
Saunders picks include "ridiculously funny" fellow Australians Bart Freebairn and Luke McGregor, but he's most excited to see American stand-up Eddie Pepitone. Saunders performs his Steele Saunders' Venue Got Demolished show at the Portland Hotel.
If you miss the yuk-fest this time around, there are plenty of other reasons for an April visit, including the balmy autumnal temperatures that hover around 25 C. Enjoy the sun with a beach visit to the funky St. Kilda neighbourhood or check out the blooms at the huge Royal Botanic Gardens - guided tours recommended. And if it rains? Duck into the sprawling Queen Victoria market for a pastry or three.
Eat: Chin Chin offers a modern take on Asian, especially Thai, street-hawker dishes - go for the pork belly (chinchinrestaurant.com.au).
Stay: Blackman Hotel has luxe contemporary rooms and art-lined interiors (artserieshotels.com.au).
Tip: The Victoria Hotel bar is great for spotting off-stage comedians, and you can challenge them to a game of pool if you're up for it (victoriahotel.com.au).
CAPE TOWN
April is autumn in the Cape Winelands region, and according to food writer Malu Lambert (malulambert.com), that's exactly why you should visit. "It's beautiful at this time of year with marigold vineyards, purple mountains and rolling green hills," she says.
But it's not just about looks. Summer's end means more personalized winery experiences. "Since harvest will just have ended, many are happy to take you on a tour of their new wines - you'll taste the juice in its fermenting stage, followed by a tasting of the real thing."
Her recommended pit stops include Moreson Farm for chardonnays and its "country chic" restaurant; Jordan Wines for great tipples and spectacular Stellenbosch Valley vistas; and Waterkloof Wines for its Schapenberg mountains location and bio-dynamic wine making.
Hiring a car (and appointing a designated driver) will get you around much of the region, which Lambert says is fairly easy to navigate. Guided tours are also available but make sure to pick one that you can tailor, she cautions. "Many tours take you on boring routes that detract from the magic of the Winelands."
Eat: The Tasting Room, where chef Margot Janse serves African-inspired dishes with knowing international influences. The multicourse tasting menu is the way to go (lqf.co.za).
Stay: Grand Daddy Hotel, for its central location and funky rooms. Why not stay in one of the rooftop Airstream trailers (granddaddy.co.za)?
Tip: Visit Muratie Wine Estate, one of the oldest wineries in South Africa. Its romantic, blast-from-the-past ambience includes rustic out buildings and antique-lined interiors. Try the port (muratie.co.za).
NEW ORLEANS
"Cultural life in New Orleans is geared to spring," says music writer Alex Rawls (myspiltmilk.com). "There's the free French Quarter Festival one weekend followed by two weekends of Jazz Fest. It's a great time to get warm before the summer swelter sets in."
Officially deemed the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, 2013's diverse draws include Billy Joel and Maroon 5. But to focus on the big names out of the hundreds acts doesn't do it justice. "If people only see headliners, they see a festival much like any other. What makes Jazz Fest distinctive is the music from the state - and much of it isn't jazz."
Rawls suggests starting each day at the festival's 11 a.m. kickoff, when emerging acts begin playing and the crowds are thinner - which means easier access to food booths that are soon swamped. But don't over plan: "Better ideas often present themselves spontaneously here," he says.
If you miss the festival, the city's toe-tapping live scene is accessible any time. Rawls's recommended venues include Tipitina's for New Orleans funk, d.b.a. on Frenchman Street for local acts and Preservation Hall for some of the best trad jazz around.
Eat: Restaurant August for old-school ambience in a former warehouse setting - and top-notch dishes from crawfish agnolotti to 48-hour braised short rib (restaurantaugust.com).
Stay: La Maison Marigny, possibly the perfect B & B. It combines a great Bourbon Street location with antique-lined rooms that define comfort. The heaping breakfasts help, too (lamaisonmarigny.com).
Tip: Take a side trip to Lafayette's Festival International. The largest outdoor free Francophone event in the United States, it offers dozens of shows over a party-like five day period (festivalinternational.com).
SAN DIEGO
Springtime San Diego combines ever-sunny skies and temperatures around 20 C. But it's not just the tan-tastic weather that lures many to California's second-biggest city, according to local master gardener Leslie Crawford (3000tomatoes.com).
Beach-fringed Coronado Island - technically a peninsula - is home to one of North America's largest floral showcases. "April's Coronado Flower Show has been a tradition since 1922," Crawford says.
She recommends at least a day for the fragrant event, perusing tented displays that include orchids, roses, wild flowers and bonsai trees. "Save time for the bandstand music, the food stands and the marketplace," she advises, adding that you can also tour prize-winning private gardens around Coronado's sunny streets.
The show isn't the area's only green-thumb magnet. Palm-lined Balboa Park includes themed gardens and the tropical Botanical Building. "It's a beautiful place," Crawford says. There are plenty of other activities to keep you occupied on a spring visit. Consider the USS Midway aircraft carrier museum and wander around the preserved adobe buildings at Old Town State Historic Park. Then rest your feet with a seasonal beer: San Diego is one of America's top craft beer cities. Look out for hoppy IPAs from Stone Brewing, Mission Brewery and Ballast Point Brewing.
Eat: Coronado Brewing Company, for house-brewed beer and a full menu of perfect pub-grub comfort dishes. Go for the ale-soaked mussels (coronadobrewingcompany.com).
Stay: 1906 Lodge at Coronado Beach. Two blocks from the water, this lovely 17-room property is like a mini-resort. Treat yourself to a garden suite for an extra dash of luxury (1906lodge.com).
Tip: If you're travelling with young children, Legoland California is a 30-minute drive north of San Diego in the sunny seaside town of Carlsbad (california.legoland.com).

READER ADVICE
Where should you go this spring? Globe readers had other ideas.
Last year the fields of bluebonnets on the road from Houston to Austin were unbelievable. While in Austin we visited the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center where we were awed again by masses of these mini lupin-like flowers. There are various short walking trails there and beautiful sculptures. Save your souvenir dollars for its lovely gift shop. Susan Evans
A week in Cuba is great. Especially if you are in Toronto where spring springs late. Mostly stay in Havana. @FastByron
Sicily is pretty nice. Endless heaps of artichokes and oranges - and no crowds. @kattancock
Washington, D.C. for the cherry blossoms! @LostNCheeseland
Victoria, B.C., (and Vancouver Island) is one of the best places to visit in spring. For the gardening types, this city is all about spring gardens. It is wonderful and crazy; not only the parks and the formal gardens, but many residents have stunning gardens. Even the normal, run-of-the-mill apartment blocks, commercial enterprises have well maintained properties. I could go on and on. ... I just love the natural beauty of this place. And I haven't even told you about the rest of the island. Terry Vatrt

Full text:   Powered by Nigeria's petro-riches, Lagos has grand aspirations as a model metropolis and the continent's economic capital. That dream may become a reality, but two-thirds of its 21 million residents still call a slum home, and ordinary citizens are weary of waiting for government to share the wealth. So they are acting. Iain Marlow chronicles four case studies that illustrate how private enterprise and new technology - as well as grassroots activists - are transforming daily life
Last month, Nigerian leader Goodluck Jonathan joined former U.S. president Bill Clinton and local dignitaries for the official groundbreaking of a property development so ambitious he calls it "a modern city" rising from the ocean.
Privately financed, Eko Atlantic City is to house 250,000 people and occupy 10 million square metres - a little bigger than Manhattan - of reclaimed land guarded by a towering sea wall that Mr. Clinton declared "an ingenious engineering feat" certain to "brand Lagos all over the world."
President Jonathan agreed: "You cannot be hearing only ugly stories" about Nigeria and the city state that drives its economy.
Yet ugly stories about Lagos keep disrupting the "good news narrative" he wants so badly.
Just two days after the presidential rhetoric, 10,000 poor people were left homeless when Lagos authorities bulldozed Badia East, a vast "informal" community next to prime real estate. Then last week, 10 armed men stormed Murtala Muhammed International Airport in a brazen robbery attempt that left two policeman and one bandit dead, and sent travellers scrambling for cover.
So, while Lagos is poised to overtake Cairo as Africa's biggest city (some say it already has), and oil-rich Nigeria is about to surpass South Africa as the continent's biggest economy, huge problems remain that cannot be ignored.
The entrepreneurial spirit here is strong - street vendors hawk copies of the Harvard Business Review to drivers stuck in traffic - but even the new Lagos edition of Monopoly (the first devoted to an African city) recognizes that the sprawling metropolis is congested and struggling with poverty.
Just as Park Place has been replaced by Banana Island, the lush playground for Nigerian millionaires, as the game's most prized property, low-rent Baltic and Mediterranean avenues have given way to Makoko and Agege, two of the city's more than 100 surviving slums.
Also, despite its grand aspirations and growing wealth, Lagos offers no guarantee of law and order - 15 years after Nigeria emerged from decades of harsh military rule, police corruption and mob violence still make the administration of justice unpredictable.
The city, in some ways, illustrates the harsh life lesson offered by Monopoly - that the mad scramble for fortune has more losers than winners. But with the population estimates as high as 21 million (rising by more than half a million a year), residents are no longer waiting for Nigeria's petro-wealth to trickle down and improve their lives.
From slum vigilantes to community activists, from creative entrepreneurs to bold capitalists, Lagos's energetic citizens are now helping to shape what may be Africa's defining city. Conventional approaches to law enforcement are being upturned and new technologies harnessed to engage and empower the average citizen. At a time when massive urban centres from Mumbai to Mexico City are home to more and more of the global population, how this African megacity tackles its problems truly matters.
"If Lagos is successful, even in some areas, it becomes a compelling model for other cities in the region," says John Campbell, a former U.S. ambassador to Nigeria.
But he is far from optimistic, given the Islamist violence in Nigeria's north and the myriad other difficulties facing Africa's most populous country. "What are the limits of progress that a particular city can make," asks Mr. Campbell, now a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, "when the national environment is very different?"
Iain Marlow, a writer with Report on Business, is spending the next six months training journalists in West Africa.
*****
Makoko: A slum fights to stay afloat
With each paddle stroke, the canoe lurches slowly through the greasy water, drifting past floating trash and beneath footbridges that connect shacks built on stilts far into Lagos Lagoon. Here, in the middle of Nigeria's largest city and within plain view of commuters, is a floating slum.
The air smells of raw sewage and wood smoke, but it is Sunday in this incredibly religious country, so children walk above the water in gleaming white robes; hymns drift from packed churches.
Half on land, Makoko is one of about 120 slums in the city. It has 150,000 residents, as well as schools, convenience stores, even sawmills, but nearly no services provided by a government that wants badly to get rid of the place.
That is why Djibe Felix has such an expansive view: A fishing boat is all that stands between the platform he shares with three wives and seven children and the towering 12-kilometre Third Mainland Bridge in the distance. But a forest of jagged stumps sticking from the water at his doorstep is a stark reminder of the many shacks authorities destroyed last summer in a week of violence. One shack was his, Mr. Felix says, his temper rising. "When they come again, we will fight them!" he yells, thumping his chest. "Their bullets will turn to water!"
Makoko is a test case for what the stewards of Africa's largest city have in mind. It is one of nine slums meant to be improved by the Lagos Metropolitan Development and Governance Project with a $200-million (U.S.) loan from the World Bank.
The official goal is to improve basic services, but the city of islands in a swampy lagoon is desperate for land to expand.
"As the city expands, access to affordable housing is shrinking," says Felix Morka, a Harvard-educated community activist advising Makoko residents. "Whatever is added, is added to the upper class."
Slums are home to two-thirds of the population, and there is little low-income housing in central Lagos. Costs are so high even the middle class is scattered to distant suburbs.
Few inhabitants of Makoko - many of them originally from down the Nigerian coast or neighbouring countries - own their homes in any legal sense. Most lack education and don't understand property law; they also fish for a living and do not want to move away from the water.
To help them stay, Mr. Morka is bringing in experts and wants to submit redevelopment plans that benefit the people already there.
Since residents held a march to muster support, the city has suspended the demolition plan and apologized for the death of a local chief shot by security forces. It also is meeting with the community, but won't let Mr. Morka or his staff at the Social and Economic Rights Action Center take part.
Publicly, officials say they will resettle residents such as Fokosi Okimigi, but the 49-year-old fisherman bemoans Makoko's precarious state. "Many white men come with cameras, and nothing gets done," he complains. "We just want the government to allow us to stay. We are citizens of Nigeria."
For his part, Mr. Morka is so skeptical of the public-private partnership authorities are proposing - "a plan to give land to their cronies ... the new phase of corruption in this country" - that he resigned from the project's steering committee.
"It's just despicable - there's no regret," he says. "That's not how to build a city."
*****
Agege: Vigilante justice turns the tide
At 52, Omodele Morufu is an unlikely vigilante. But sitting in a police station in this slum on the outskirts of Lagos, the municipal garbage collector explains why he ended up patrolling one of West Africa's more dangerous urban areas by moonlight.
Rape and murder were common in Agege, as was burglary. Even being doused in petrol and set alight, a rogue form of justice here, was not enough to deter petty thieves.
Agege residents come from many regions in Nigeria and neighbouring nations. In 2004, violence between local ethnic Yoruba and Hausa from the north led to street battles waged with spears and guns. The police station, just down the street from a stand that sells gleaming machetes, was almost burned to the ground before the military marched in. "Many died," Mr. Morufu says. "Many wounded."
In 2009, fed-up residents acted for themselves, forming a vigilante group to stamp out the chaos. Police here are poorly paid, highly susceptible to bribes and often vindictive; local people used to throw beer bottles at anyone in uniform who ventured too far down the narrow lanes that snake beneath Agege's rusted metal roofs.
At first, the vigilantes were little better than their targets. They harassed anyone who looked suspicious and fights were common. "We would box them," Mr. Morufu recalls, punching the air. It was impossible to tell if things were getting better. But word of the midnight patrols spread, prompting a non-profit organization dedicated to better policing to get involved.
Wary, the police asked the agency to shut down the vigilantes. "We didn't do that," says Innocent Chukwuma, who started the CLEEN Foundation (formerly the Centre for Law Enforcement Education) after being jailed repeatedly by Nigeria's former military regime as a student activist. "It's like telling them they have no rights."
Instead, his group gave the vigilantes rainboots and flashlights, and started a community forum in which the police trained them to write reports on their patrols, some of which stretched all night. Now, instead of throwing bottles, they provide officers with information about the community and its problems. Mr. Morufu, who just finished a night patrol, even has the station chief's personal mobile number, and not long ago used it at 2 in the morning to call for armed support.
In a country where police regularly beat people and demand bribes, this is real progress. The vigilantes have not recorded a single rape in more than a year, Mr. Morufu says, adding that it's safe to park a new okada and walk away - the motorcycle will still be there when you return.
The Agege policing model is now being applied across the city and beyond - even in the violent, oil-rich Niger Delta.
"Police can move now anywhere in here," Mr. Morufu says, gesturing out the window. He calls Agege "one of the most peaceful communities ... in all of Nigeria - really!"

Eko Atlantic: The future on a grand scale
Ahmadu Bello Way runs along the coast past a row of dilapidated seaside hotels and businesses, many now boarded up and abandoned.
Historic maps show that the shoreline once extended almost another three kilometres into the Atlantic, but dredging in the early 1900s removed a crucial, protective sandbar. A few years ago, the erosion finally reached Ahmadu Bello Way, part of which collapsed into the sea.
Pledging to fix the problem, the Lagos governor at the time asked developers for plans and wound up with one of the most remarkable infrastructure projects on the planet: Eko Atlantic. It involves extensive dredging of the ocean floor to add a nine-square-kilometre wedge to Victoria Island (the central part of Lagos facing the Atlantic) for a gleaming city of 250,000.
As well as luxury apartments and a shining forest of corporate headquarters, Eko (the original name for Lagos, in Yoruba) will feature luxuries that most of Lagos currently lacks, such as uninterrupted power, clean drinking water and fibre-optic connections. "It's enormous," project director David Frame says.
After almost five years of work, there is little more than a huge spit of sand. But his vision includes a 60-metre-wide boulevard like the Champs-élysees, waterways for yachts and a financial centre with ultramodern skyscrapers. A district called Harbour Lights that will look back toward Lagos proper, bustling with activity against a backdrop of five-star hotels, glittering lights and passing ships from around the world. Harbour Lights particularly enthralls Mr. Frame, a surveyor from London who arrived in Lagos in 1981: It is where he plans to live.
"Nigeria is in my blood," he says after delivering an exhaustive technical briefing.
"You can sit on your balcony, sipping a martini, enjoying the view and, with that cool breeze, it's a very attractive concept."
Certainly, it's much more attractive than Makoko, the floating slum the government wants to remove from Lagos Lagoon. But does Eko offer any more relief for a city with a real lack of middle-class housing? It strikes most observers as being purpose-built for the elite.
Sam Nwosu, the ebullient Nigerian-American country director for Nokia Siemens Networks, says building lots in the part of Lagos where he lives cost up to $500,000 U.S., yet he doesn't feel he could afford Eko Atlantic. However, Mr. Nwosu adds, many truly well-off Nigerians are "willing to pay a premium for anything that works."
Even so, Nigeria's President chose Eko's groundbreaking ceremony to unveil a federal plan (backed by $300-million from the World Bank) to boost residential construction and relax mortgage restrictions.
Mr. Frame, meanwhile, insists Eko developers are being encouraged to target middle- as well as high-income earners. His employer, South EnergyX Nigeria Ltd., can dictate what is built, and he says some units will cost about $300,000.
Still, at least one Nigerian sees Eko Atlantic as entirely segregated from the realities of Lagos life. Driving away from the site, along a road so flooded his car leaves a wake, he gestures back at the vast expanse of dirt and dreams.
"That place for big man," he says bitterly. "That place like London - like other country."

Co-Creation Hub: Mobilizing citizens' rights
Lagos is famous for its traffic, but this morning a torrential downpour, a fuel shortage and the closing of the 12-kilometre Third Mainland Bridge, which ties the city together, have caused complete gridlock - and tension.
Suddenly, for no discernible reason, a policeman rips a man from his car and starts slamming his head on the hood of a nearby Toyota. When the driver complains, he simply shoves his victim to the back of another vehicle.
People here are accustomed to random police brutality and corruption. And the city's energetic governor, Babatunde Fashola, has moved to impose order on this unruly city. But frustrated younger Nigerians - some recently returned from abroad - are impatient, and now looking to new technologies for solutions.
Although few Nigerians own personal computers, around 100 million in a population of 170 million have cellphones (Canada's BlackBerry is the brand of choice with about 60 per cent of the market), and more than 600,000 of them have downloaded a mobile version of the nation's constitution.
Produced at the Co-Creation Hub, a socially progressive tech incubator launched by globetrotting entrepreneur 'Bosun Tijani, the phone app allows people to share parts of the constitution on Facebook and Twitter, with commentary, and to take part in discussion forums on everything from corruption in politics to oil revenue. "The objective is to empower people, to have them become more knowledgeable about their rights," co-creator Zubair Abubakar says. "That way, we can be more patriotic."
His software will not stop a cop's blow, but Mr. Abubakar has heard of police thinking better of demanding a bribe when, instead of paying up, victims read out their rights from their phones.
And now the battle against corruption has reached a new level with the official launch this month of StopTheBribes.net, a website - built with financial help from the Canadian High Commission - that lets mobile users report police behaving badly via text message, e-mail or Twitter (hashtag #StopTheBribes).
As well as appearing on the website, messages - such as one that reads, "Police extortion refusal leads to bus conductor brutalised" - now pop up on a large TV in a central police station, alerting senior officers.
The "CcHUB," as people call it, attracts young programmers for a number of reasons: It has free access to broadband Internet, which is neither cheap nor common in Lagos; uninterrupted power in a city where outages are almost hourly (the hub has its own generators); in-depth training seminars, and a collegial atmosphere. It also has a killer rooftop patio.
Despite their casual surroundings, the programmers have a mission more serious than most in Silicon Valley. "Trying to build a Nigerian Facebook is cool," Mr. Tijani says, "but is that where there's pain in this society?"
Their labours have also produced BudgIT, a website that allows people to slice and dice the federal budget and determine, for example, whether the government really needed to cut subsidies of imported fuel last year (none of the oil the country produces is refined here).
The cuts sparked large-scale protests that soon morphed into a loose movement dubbed Occupy Nigeria and fuelled by another of the hub's apps: Ojise ("message" in a local dialect), which makes using Twitter and uploading files easier on Nigeria's congested mobile networks.
Ojise developer Seun Akinfolarin, 28, predicts more protests as tech-savvy young Nigerians tackle what they consider to be the country's corrupt old order.
"If we can't get the government to help," he says, surrounded by colleagues leaning over laptops, "we'll have to do it ourselves."

THE BACK STORY
Chris Shaw was a single guy exploring Cabbagetown and hanging out at the neighbourhood's annual festival when he stumbled across an "open house" at a semi-detached red brick Victorian on Wellesley Street East.
"I was definitely not in the market for a four-bedroom house at the time," he says.
Mr. Shaw was also repelled by the exterior, which had an aluminum door and mid-century porch stuck on the front. But he ventured inside and found the interior had all of the character the exterior lacked.
A previous owner had opened up the main living area to create a modern house while preserving many of the original period details.
"They blended the modern with the old versus just putting a brand new house inside."
Mr. Shaw worked with local heritage authorities to restore the facade. He also added landscaping and gardens.
The polished heritage plaque which now hangs beside the front door reveals that the original owner of the circa 1902 house was Thomas E.B. Yates and he was a clerk.
The plaque also states that the architect was the notable Charles Gibson, who also designed churches, schools and houses throughout the city.
THE HOUSE TODAY
The main living area of the house has been opened up to create a living room open to the dining room. A new modern staircase with teak millwork leads to the upstairs and creates separation between the spaces.
The living room has been stripped of Victorian plaster and embellishments to create a modern space with a wood-burning fireplace and exposed brick wall. A reminder of the home's past can be found in the stained glass above the front window.
At the rear of the house, a modern kitchen with maple wood cabinets has sliding doors leading to a terrace. The original butler's stairs lead to the second floor.
"They're super-handy to have and it's kind of a nice feature of an old house," says Mr. Shaw.
The master bedroom is on the second floor at the front of the house. Built-in closets provide lots of storage and an ensuite bathroom with walk-in shower is hidden behind a sliding wooden door.
Even the basin is made of wood.
"It's a pretty cool detail," says Mr. Shaw.
That floor has two other bedrooms and a bathroom with air-jet tub.
The third floor has a large family room and a separate office.
Downstairs, the house has a recreation room and a wine cellar, which stands behind some reclaimed barn doors that Mr. Shaw had shipped over from Europe.
Mr. Shaw enjoys the neighbourhood and the village feeling on Parliament Street. He also walks to his job in the financial district.
"I work at Bay and Front and I walk to work every day of the year," says Mr. Shaw.
THE BEST FEATURE
Mr. Shaw and his fiancee, Camilla Bartosiewicz, enjoy spending summer evenings on the large rooftop deck outside of the third-floor family room.
An outdoor fireplace provides atmosphere.
"We literally fall asleep out here," says Mr. Shaw.
The vistas extend from the treetops to the downtown skyline and the CN Tower.
"The view of the city is unbelievable," he says.
Cabbagetown is protected under heritage regulations so new high-rise towers are unlikely to spring up nearby, says Mr. Shaw.
"There will never be anything that can block that view."

Full text:   Replacing an old friend's beloved but tired summer home forced architect to condense her design flair to its essence
'It was one of the smallest budgets that I have ever worked with, but I believe the house is one of the strongest architectural pieces that I have ever designed."
Architect Cindy Rendely was taken on a journey of professional rediscovery with the design of this lakeside cottage and she has a lifelong friend and his family to thank for pushing her to go against her tendency to fuss over the details and to condense her design flair to its absolute essence.
Located on the eastern shore of Lake Simcoe, until recently the long thin lot was presided over by a 60 year-old cottage, built by the great-grandfather of the family whom Ms. Rendely came to know well as she grew up in Brantford, Ont. With their ancestral cottage now in a "very tired" state, the current head of the family, and the architect's childhood friend, turned to Ms. Rendely to design them a new but affordable house that would accommodate three generations.
The new cottage is arranged as three distinct volumes. From the road, the garage comes first, its rectangular form and steep pitched roof with minimal overhang a precursor of what is to come and a study of what Ms. Rendely gleefully refers to as "a child's stick drawing design." Set back, separated by a small section of lawn, is a long thin single-storey building located on the same east west axis as the garage. Replicating the garage in form, this volume contains four bedrooms, a communal bathroom and the kitchen portion of the main living space.
Adjacent to the bedroom block, at its west, lakeside end is the third building, a two-storey element that houses the main living space, which links seamlessly with the aforementioned kitchen, along with the master bedroom and ensuite. This building has a flat roof, in contrast to the pitched vernacular of the garage and bedroom buildings. It seems at odds with them but as Ms. Rendely explains, it is one detail of many that was arrived at during discussions with the family about this project that became so personal.
"There were some members of the extended family who didn't want to tear down the existing cottage at all; it held many memories for them," Ms. Rendely said. "They were very nostalgic about the old place and so the design of the new house does make reference to the original cottage both in its white colouring and pitched roof."
However, where the old cottage turned its back to the lake, Ms. Rendely's design presents an almost transparent main living space, with views out to the lake in the west and the garden to the east. The new cottage is a great improvement; the memories that the family holds dear will come with time.
"The family wanted the cottage to have a pitched roof; they liked the traditional. I wanted it to have a flat roof because I'm a modernist architect. We went back and forth, arguing for and against each solution and I came to realize that my preconceived ideas were perhaps not all correct. I came to see that the local vernacular and family ideals were important."
The result is a harmonious compromise that creates two distinct volumes: the flat-roofed lakefront volume and the bedroom building with its steeply pitched roof. The buildings, though physically joined, contrast - male and female, ying and yang - and complement.
Similarly, Ms. Rendely conceded to the use of white PVC windows, due to the constraints of the budget. "Whereas normally I would flatly refuse to entertain a product that I dislike so vehemently - I hate how white-plastic windows pop out at you from every brick-clad subdivision - here the client insisted because of cost constraints and the lack of maintenance required. This decision pushed me to think differently, to work around 'my problem.'" The architect's solution was to clad the entire façade in white prepainted wooden siding, thus rendering the white-plastic windows invisible and presenting a clean, minimal aesthetic.
Materials, features and fixtures all were considered and critiqued by Ms. Rendely and her client friend in order to minimize costs. This rigorous process worked well with the architect's admitted preoccupation for perfection and helped create a beautifully harmonious interior that utilizes a minimal palette of warm maple plus grey-porcelain tile and matching laminate. However, what the paring back of design gestures also did was bring the realization that geometry and form were paramount to the project's success.
"Although I am known for the Ravine House and the use of expensive materials, modernity is not about the latest, greatest ..." says Ms. Rendely. "Here, scale, massing and proportion became the absolute drivers; connection to the landscape and respect for the surrounding context were vital."
The constraints put upon the architect - cost limitations, vernacular considerations and strong personal ties - have combined to produce not a watered-down project but a distillation of design, a wonderfully mature solution to a complex set of challenges.
"It might seem I was set up to fail by working with people whom I've known forever and whom I love but we've come out of the project as friends, and I now realize that they pushed me to produce what I consider is one of my most accomplished works to date," says Ms. Rendely with a smile.

The Action: In an established East York community, this detached, back-split residence was given an aggressive price in the mid-$400,000s and various cosmetic makeovers, which successfully pulled hundreds of visitors to the open houses late February. After the weekend, a bidding war broke out between 17 buyers, including many local families.
What They Got: This updated post-war home on a 34-by-100-foot corner lot appears to be a traditional, brick bungalow from Amsterdam Avenue, but the side view reveals three levels of living space for a total of 2,709 square feet.
* In the past few years, the previous owners not only added the two-car garage, walkway and fencing around the south-facing yard and shed, but modernized the eat-in kitchen with tile flooring, granite counters and stainless steel appliances.
* Original areas inside consist of an L-shaped living and dining area and a small den - or small bedroom - on the main floor, which features a set of stairs up to two bedrooms and a secondary staircase down to a side exit and lower-level recreation room with a fireplace, one of two bathrooms and laundry room with entry to the garage.
The Agent's Take: "There wasn't too much on the market, so that's why we sold this property for over $100,000 because of supply and demand," agent Cameron Weir said. "It's a lot of bang for your buck, when you look around to see what you can get for $555,000 in Toronto now."
While more properties are being topped up in the area recently, this one will likely remain as is. "It was just turnkey for someone to move in," Mr. Weir said.

Full text:   Lanterra Developments is in talks to change a two-tower concept to a single tower with green space
A developer that has just beat out a number of rivals to buy a much-coveted piece of land on Wellesley Street West near Yonge Street is now in talks with the city about scaling down its condominium plans to make room for a park.
As a result, Toronto Councillor Kristyn Wong-Tam is now confident her long-held desire to see this particular parcel of land become home to some sort of green space, something local residents have also pushed hard for, will be realized.
The turn of events comes after Ms. Wong-Tam fought a losing battle last year to persuade Infrastructure Ontario to let the city lease the land and build a park, potentially with an underground parking lot to raise revenues for both governments. Infrastructure Ontario was selling the two-acre-plus site in order to raise money for the province.
"We would have loved to have been able to purchase it from the province, but the province invited the city to bid on the land in competition with developers," Ms. Wong-Tam said in an interview. "And we were not successful at being creative and creating a new working relationship with the province because they wanted maximum dollar, and there's just no way the City of Toronto could compete with deep-pocket developers."
After two rounds of bidding, the site went to Lanterra Developments, whose CEO Barry Fenton says the company paid $65-million, more than original estimates of what the site would go for. Mr. Fenton said that when the company acquired the nearby Sutton Place Hotel on Bay Street, which it is now turning into The Britt Condos, it paid $58-million. "But it came with a building in place and a lot of infrastructure. This site is barren," he said in an interview. "It's a lot of money to spend for 21/4 acres of land."
He added that his understanding is that the province received numerous offers from condo developers, office developers, pension funds and other real estate players.
Now Lanterra is planning to submit an application to the city this week to obtain about 950,000 square feet, enough space for two condo towers. But Mr. Fenton and Ms. Wong-Tam are in talks about doing something different on the site.
"We are in fluid discussions with the city councillor, and the game plan is to see if we can work something out over the next few months that provides more of a park concept with one tower, and that's something that we would look to do," Mr. Fenton said.
Ms. Wong-Tam suggested she's optimistic.
"The province was suggesting to developers that they can develop the site by putting in two to three condominium or office towers," she said. "Lanterra has been put on notice, and I did tell them that I would expect to see a park as soon as possible."
The land was once supposed to become home to a ballet and opera house, but governments withdrew the funding for that project in the recession of the early 1990s.
Ms. Wong-Tam said the neighbourhood is one of the most dense parts of the city and there are few remaining opportunities to create park space. "As we lose all the infill sites, opportunities to create new community amenities and new community spaces are lost forever," she said.
"I believe the end result will be a win-win," Mr. Fenton said. He expects condos won't be completed on the site for five or six years, with marketing likely to begin more than a year from now after the zoning application is approved.
He remains a believer in the strength of Toronto's condo market, despite falling sales across the city and the warnings of economists who suggest the market is overvalued. "I'm spending a lot of money on something when people are telling us every day it's doom and gloom," he said.

Full text:   Scion of Quebec property dynasty was also a tennis player, amateur architect and trained pilot
Alexis Nihon II's accomplishments can be seen as the perfect sequel to his original namesake's legacy. The first Alexis Nihon purchased land, while the second generation Alexis Nihon developed it.
Working with his brother Robert, Mr. Nihon II turned large parcels of land on the island of Montreal into industrial parks surrounding Trudeau International Airport. He also founded the company Anco Lands and substantially developed Bahamian property his father had purchased years earlier.
As longtime chairman of the Alexis Nihon Corp., Mr. Nihon, who died in Montreal on Feb. 24 of liver cancer, at 67, would eventually oversee the acquisition of 10-million square feet of commercial, office and residential real estate in Quebec.
Alexis Joseph Nihon was born Jan. 10, 1946, in Montreal, the eldest of three children. His mother, Alice (nee Robert), before becoming a stay-at-home mother, had worked for Mr. Nihon Sr. as a secretary.
By the time Alexis Jr. arrived, his father's Industrial Glass Works Co. Ltd. had made quite a lot of money, thanks to Mr. Nihon Sr.'s discovery of a synthetic alternative to soda ash, a raw material used for making glass, and one in short supply during the Second World War.
Mr. Nihon Sr. recognized the importance of the international airport and bought up 100 million square feet of neighbouring property. He also leased land to a downtown developer, who, in a negotiation concession, named the shopping, office and residential property the Alexis Nihon Plaza.
Alexis Jr.'s infancy was marked by tragedy, when his two older sisters, who were 5 and 7 at the time, died in a tragic accident just off the shores of Montreal, drowning after a boat's engine caught fire.
The family lived more than half the year in the Bahamas from the time Alexis Jr. was one year old. While in Montreal, they lived on the city's West Island, which was still quite rural in the early 1950s, with lots of woods, milk and bread delivery by horse, and a chicken coop on the Nihon property.
Mr. Nihon Sr. had an ongoing feud with the local yacht club, which sounded a cannon for its races. Rebuffed in his efforts to get them to stop the tradition, he bought his own cannon and fired it during their races, confusing the participants.
Despite his riches, he remained anti-elitist and insisted that his children attend public school.
Young Alexis would be the only white person in an all-black school in Nassau. In Dorval, he attended the local Catholic public school.
As he got older, he took summer jobs, one of them in a modest golf club his father owned. "His father said, 'I'm not going to be raising spoiled brats,' " recalls Mr. Nihon II's wife, Cornelia, who said her late father-in-law was a stern European father. He did, however, shower on his children many travel experiences.
Alexis and brother Robert both took up wrestling as youths; it was a sport their father had enjoyed in his native Belgium. The two would end up representing the Bahamas in the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City. Alexis, who was 22 years old, 6 foot 4, and 212 pounds, fought as a light heavyweight, taking on one wrestler from Poland and another from Mongolia.
He could tell from the initial parade of athletes at the opening ceremonies that the Mongolian he would be fighting, and who was that country's flag bearer, would prove to be a formidable opponent, he told his friend and former colleague, Senator Paul Massicotte. While all the other flag bearers held their country's large flags with two arms, the Mongolian wrestler used just one to hold up the large flag. "He held it out straight for an hour and a half," said Mr. Massicotte.
Robert, who fought in the middleweight category, and Alexis both lost their matches.
The Nihon brothers were both working for their father at this point, having gone directly from high school into the family business.
In 1976, Mr. Nihon II met his future wife, Cornelia. While she credits his dancing for the initial romantic spark, she said he had not always been a good dancer. In his early 20s, during a visit to France, a girl coaxed him onto a stage with her. The result was not pretty. "When he got back home he went to the first dance school he could find so that he would never be in that position again," she said.
Their courtship also had him asking his father, who was to receive the Order of the British Empire in Nassau from the Queen, for a rare favour: Could his girlfriend meet the Queen? She could. And she did.
On April 8, 1980, Mr. Nihon Sr. died. The next day, the couple's second child was born (becoming Alexis III) and, soon after, a new chapter for the Alexis Nihon Corp. would be written.
"They could have sold all that land," said Mr. Massicotte, who would eventually serve as president. "Instead, they began to develop it."
In 1983, the brothers purchased Alexis Nihon Plaza. The building with the family name was in need of some redevelopment.
Three years later, on a weekend afternoon in late October, Mr. Nihon got word that the plaza's 15-storey office tower was on fire. "That's not a very funny joke," he told his mother-in-law from the Bahamas. She had called him from her home in Westmount, which overlooked the complex. Reality quickly set in; the 13-hour blaze would become the largest office-tower fire in Canadian history.
For days after, parts of downtown Montreal had to be closed for fear of the tower collapsing. Tenants who were locked out over safety concerns were frustrated, including Air Canada, which had a reservation system housed in the office tower.
No casualties occured, but a subsequent civil trial to recoup damages resulted in Alexis Nihon Corp. having to pay $43-million in damages. The reconstruction took six months but, ever the developers, the Nihon brothers used that time to build a second tower.
Described as safety-conscious and always looking at contingencies, Mr. Nihon had, luckily, taken out substantial insurance on the plaza. His need to over-insure would also be the source of some ribbing, according to Mrs. Nihon. She laughs about how she finally convinced him last year to cancel the earthquake insurance for their home in Westmount, situated on land nowhere near any traditional fault line.
He was a meticulous planner, an amateur architect and a trained pilot, who flew twin-props mostly over the Carribbean islands. He loved playing poker, got in a game of tennis almost every day and enjoyed taking his kids skiing.
He learned German late in life and spoke it with his elder daughter, Sophia. He believed strongly in his children's education and instituted regular after-dinner speeches, his youngest daughter Julia giving several on how much she missed the old babysitter.
He knew how to schmooze and had a very public name, but he was an inherently private man. "This is an island," he liked to say of the Nassau area.
By 1996, Mr. Nihon resigned from the corporation bearing his name so that he could focus more on managing and developing the family's Bahamian holdings. His brother took over as chairman. In 2002, the corporation went public and, by 2007, the family sold off its remaining holdings.
Playing piano was another hobby Mr. Nihon loved, and he could always be counted on to offer up his version of Edith Piaf's La Vie en Rose . The song would end up being sung at his funeral.
Mr. Nihon leaves his wife, Cornelia, their four children, Sophia, Alexis, Philip and Julia, and sister Claudette. He was predeceased by his brother, Robert, and youngest son, George, who died at 13 months.

Full text:   The new arena and return of the NHL's Jets have fuelled the first commercial real estate boom downtown in decades
'If you build it, he will come."
The memorable motto from Field of Dreams , urging Kevin Costner's film character to build a baseball diamond on his Iowa farm, could just as easily describe Mark Chipman's vision. More than a decade ago, the chief executive officer of True North Sports and Entertainment proposed building an arena in downtown Winnipeg.
At the time the notion that a new arena would bring back the National Hockey League following the Jets' departure for Phoenix in the 1990s seemed as preposterous as - well - building a ball diamond in a Midwest cornfield, hoping the 1919 Chicago Black Sox would reappear.
Mr. Chipman's story has a Hollywood ending, too. The MTS Centre was built and the Jets, also owned by True North, came back in 2011 to play in the new $133.5-million, 15,000-seat arena.
Moreover, the NHL's return has sparked a commercial real estate boom downtown. New development - an unfamiliar sight in the city's downtown since the 1980s - is becoming commonplace, says the head of the city's arm's-length development agency, Centre Venture Development Corp.
Today, the downtown is in the midst of a commercial development renaissance with more than $1.2-billion in projects completed, under way or planned, says Ross McGowan, CEO of Centre Venture.
"There is tremendous confidence in large part because of the NHL's return," he adds.
Even prior to big league hockey's return, downtown development had generated national interest in part because Manitoba's slow-but-steady economy didn't experience a recession in 2008-09 like many other provinces, Mr. McGowan says.
"Running parallel to that was a renaissance, the result of a pretty solid development strategy that was focused, involving a lot of public investment laying the groundwork."
Manitoba Hydro Place, the Canadian Museum for Human Rights and the Convention Centre expansion are just a few of the recent downtown mega-projects dependent on public funds. Even the MTS Centre received substantial public support, including $40-million of taxpayer money.
"So the plan to revitalize downtown was percolating along, but then the Jets' announcement was an affirmation," Mr. McGowan adds.
Now large-scale private sector projects - unheard of for decades - have also returned, helping to drive up property values.
Winnipeg was the third-fastest growing commercial real estate market in the country, posting a 16.8-per-cent return for 2012 compared with the national average of 14.1 per cent, according to a report commissioned by the Real Property Association of Canada.
"We're on a good roll," says Ken Yee, senior vice-president with Cushman & Wakefield, a commercial realtor.
Office leasing costs for Class A space in downtown have doubled in some instances from about $15 or $17 a square foot to between $25 and $30, he says. "Prior to the Jets - even though the arena was there - not a lot of national chains were banging on the door to be downtown."
It's a much different situation today. The downtown's largest, new private development - Centrepoint - had four full-price bids from national restaurant chains for a 9,000-square-foot space facing the MTS Centre, he says.
"That kind of activity was not there prior to the Jets' announcement."
Even a project of Centrepoint's scale - exceeding $100-million - would have been much riskier without the NHL, says Doug McKay, director of commercial development for Longboat Development Corporation.
The developer is the driving force behind Centrepoint, which includes an Alt boutique hotel, five stories of office space and an adjoining condominium project called the Glass House. In addition, Longboat has another $100-million-plus proposal for the south side of the MTS Centre, featuring an outdoor plaza and giant video screen to broadcast games, tentatively called So/Po, short for "south of Portage."
"For us there's no doubt about the NHL's effect," Mr. McKay says.
Toronto-based Milestones restaurant had the winning bid for the prime spot in the Centrepoint project, while a successful local restaurateur will open an Asian-Mexican fusion cantina, Chino Libre, in an adjacent 4,000-square-foot space.
While an immense source of pride for Winnipeggers, the Jets have also raised Winnipeg's profile nationally, attracting out-of-province developers, including Fortress Real Developments Inc.
The Toronto-based developer is finalizing plans for a multiuse project within a block of the MTS Centre, worth about $150-million.
"Winnipeg was on our radar before the Jets," says Jawad Rathore, its CEO and president.
The city's designation of the 11-block area surrounding the arena as SHED (Sports, Hospitality and Entertainment District), offering financial incentives for high-density development, certainly made the numbers attractive before the NHL, but the Jets reinforced their interest, he says. More than anything, the NHL brings warm bodies on cold winter nights on a regular basis - a reason to be downtown that wasn't always there before, Mr. Rathore says.
This is crucial in building vital communities, he adds. Although a handful of condo developments in the area in the past few years has struggled to find a steady market, now developers, such as Fortress, believe activity has reached a tipping point, and a new generation will look at working, playing and living downtown as a viable option.
"You have to give people a reason to go downtown," Mr. Rathore says. "This truly is a case of, 'If you build it, they will come.'"

Abstract: It's looking to move into more mall development and acquisitions in Europe, where, again, the company can operate to "the rule of doing better what you do well already." Europe, he said, is a particularly attractive target because it's "probably four decades behind in the mall business."

Full text:   Ivanhoé Cambridge plans a mini city, not just a makeover, for Vancouver's Oakridge Centre
Mall redevelopments often mean a little spiffing up, a few thousand more square feet of retail space, better branding.
But the plan for Vancouver's Oakridge Centre mall - a classic 1950s development parked in the middle of Vancouver's single-family swathe in the south half of the city - is light-years beyond that.
Instead, owner Ivanhoé Cambridge is investing $1-billion to transform the mall into its own small city, with almost 3,000 residential units in 13 towers that will cluster around a shopping centre that's twice its current size.
Included in that massive 28-acre project - double the area of the city's Olympic Village and triple the housing - will be public gardens, 400 units of rental housing, 150 units aimed at seniors, a community centre, a daycare and a library.
If it gets approval from the city as is, it will become the biggest investment Ivanhoé is making in any of its real-estate holdings in the world.
"Nothing else comes close to the size of this," says Roman Drohomirecki, the company's vice-president for operations in western North America.
The Oakridge redevelopment (which includes a partnership on the residential side with local developer Ian Gillespie) is not just a result of the attractive Vancouver market. It's just one play - albeit a big one - in the global strategy of Quebec's pension-fund manager Caisse de depôt et placement du Quebec, where Ivanhoé Cambridge functions as the real-estate division.
That strategy is to put more money into real estate in Canada and around the world, as real estate has edged out the bond market recently for returns on investment.
The Caisse announced in January this year that it planned to shift $10-billion more of its assets into real estate for a new total of $40-billion. That will boost Ivanhoe's standing even higher among the 10 largest property investors in the world where it already lives, among others from Dubai, Kuwait, China, Norway and the United States.
That move into real estate is similar to what other Canadian pension funds are doing, although on a much larger scale. As a result, between Ivanhoé and others, Canadian companies have been on a buying spree around the world recently.
But Ivanhoé is not just going to throw its money around randomly. As the company's investments president explained in a recent Globe and Mail interview, the company has learned through some difficult lessons that it does better when it does less.
"We have been extremely successful where we have a concentration of assets and people," says Bill Tresham, in a rundown of the company's strategy worldwide.
Mr. Tresham said the company has done well in its mall holdings in Brazil, "where we've been able to export our abilities gained in Canada."
It's looking to move into more mall development and acquisitions in Europe, where, again, the company can operate to "the rule of doing better what you do well already." Europe, he said, is a particularly attractive target because it's "probably four decades behind in the mall business."
He has said earlier that the company has struggled with its investments in Russia and China.
Now, the idea is to stick with its proven strengths: Office buildings in Paris and London and some key American cities. And malls, in the markets where they can be successful.
Ivanhoé has done spectacularly well with malls in Canada, where its high-level shopping centres far outperform most American ones. So it makes sense to invest more in those malls. But there isn't a lot of empty land available in Canadian cities for giant new developments.
That's why $1-billion is going into Oakridge, and an additional $280-million into the Guildford Mall in Surrey. Along with that in the past year: A $200-million redevelopment at the Bayshore Mall in Ottawa; an $87-million makeover at Vaughan Mills north of Toronto.
"Where we look is 'Can we profitably invest in what we own already?'" Mr. Tresham said. He's a fan of malls as a real-estate investment.
"When you own hotels, you rent one day at a time. With apartments, it's one year at a time. With office tenants, maybe five years. But when you rent space in a mall, you rent it forever. And we happen to own the best class of real estate in what has turned out to be the best-performing economy in the world."
Canadian mall owners are benefitting in two ways. They didn't suffer nearly as much during the recession as their American or European counterparts, so they have their profits from those years intact and available to invest.
Ivanhoé's profitability during the recession, along with the Caisse's extra $10-billion commitment, have also made it possible to move aggressively into non-Canadian markets.
The company is also investing in office development or acquisitions in the markets where it believes it can be successful. Ivanhoé is building a third tower at Burnaby's Metrotown on spec. It announced recently it is partnering on a 45-storey tower in Chicago's West Loop. And it has made big buys of offices in both Paris and London, one the Peugeot headquarters for $350-million, the other the Woolgate Exchange building for $400-million.
Mr. Tresham said the value of real estate is that its profits never vanish, no matter how bad things get. "If I properly invest, my return might vary but it won't go away."
And at least the pension fund can manage what it has as the economy varies. Which is what pension funds want more than anything these days.
"A lot of pension funds used to invest in other funds and they had no control," Mr. Tresham said. "Pension funds have become far more activist. We want direct control."

Full text:   RETAILING REPORTER
Mall wars have stepped up among major landlords as they try to lure large anchor tenants, reflecting a new era for department stores in Canada.
Cadillac Fairview Corp. and Oxford Properties Group are fighting to snare potentially lucrative department-store retailers, including Nordstrom Inc. of Seattle, Toronto-based Holt Renfrew & Co. and Quebec-based La Maison Simons, which generate above-average industry sales.
In the latest round of negotiations, Oxford is in talks to entice high-end Holt Renfrew to its fast-growing Square One Shopping Centre in Mississauga, Ont., which would result in Cadillac's Sherway Gardens in Toronto losing Holts although it is picking up Nordstrom, industry sources said.
Oxford also is talking to Nordstrom about a store in Toronto's Yorkdale Shopping Centre, among the country's top performing malls. And Cadillac, which has signed on this country's first four Nordstrom stores, is discussing bringing Simons to its Rideau Centre in Ottawa following that retailer's splashy launch in West Edmonton Mall last fall, its first foray outside of Quebec.
"We have not seen this level of activity with the anchor department stores in 10 years - we haven't seen it ever," said Anthony Casalanguida, general manager of Yorkdale.
The flurry of activity is in stark contrast to five years ago, when landlords virtually had given up on department stores as vital anchor tenants. They got financial breaks from malls in return for attracting shoppers, but incumbents the Bay and Sears failed to draw big crowds.
The dynamics started to change in 2011 after U.S. Target Corp. said it was coming to Canada this month, triggering a race among other U.S. retailers to find store sites here. The dearth of prime retail space led to the current jostling among mall owners, which are now betting on the star power of department stores to help bolster business.
"The U.S. anchor retailers, like Nordstrom, have seen we've had a very weak anchor community in Canada and felt there was an opportunity," said Jeffrey Berkowitz, president of retail adviser Aurora Realty Consultants. "It was a wake-up call for local players."
Today, Hudson's Bay Co. is showing signs of a revival under U.S. owner Richard Baker, a real estate specialist who engineered Target's arrival to Canada by selling most of HBC's Zellers' leases to the American discounter. Even so, some mall owners grapple with long-standing lease provisions that often give HBC and Sears Canada Inc. essentially veto rights to stop department-store competitors from entering a mall.
The Bay and Sears have clauses in many of their mall leases that let them refuse permission for a rival department-store retailer to move in unless the landlord pays hefty penalties, which filter down to retailers in higher costs.
Mr. Baker said he welcomes malls bringing in new retail tenants because they attract more shoppers to the centres overall. "But we're not in the business of giving up our customer parking, our visibility and the quality at our end of the mall when malls are redeveloped," he added.
In the mall sweepstakes, Cadillac so far has been a big winner, having snagged Nordstrom last year for four of its centres, with openings starting in 2014. The deal came together after Cadillac sealed a $170-million agreement with struggling Sears to sell back four of its leases to the landlord.
Now Oxford is looking to raise its anchor-tenant profile, with talks underway with Holts, Nordstrom and Simons, sources said.
Long-time anchor tenants have other advantages, including low-cost lease rates of between about $5 and $10 a square foot annually, while non-anchor tenants pay up to 10 or 15 times more than those amounts, estimated John Crombie, national retail director at realtor Cushman & Wakefield Ltd.
But mall owners have woken up to the resurgence in anchors, he added. "This is a big draw for customers and a draw to get better retailers into the properties."
Oxford and Cadillac officials declined to comment on potential talks with tenants. But Oxford executive vice-president Michael Kitt said the biggest stumbling block for new anchors is finding prime space, not restrictive clauses in rivals' leases. "The very best malls are full."

LISTING AGENT
Mark Evernden, Sotheby's International Realty Canada
The Action: In a new subdivision near Ambrose University College in Calgary, this unconventional, custom bungalow stayed on the market for a large majority of 2011.
Last year, another realtor - Mark Evernden - relisted the property around $1.7-million and launched an aggressive ad campaign, even flying in a Vancouver film crew to create an in-depth video about the property, city and provincial attractions for curious buyers abroad. After about a dozen showings, a local resident drafted a bid.
What They Got: The sloping grade of a 76-by 131-foot lot beneath this four-year-old bungalow allows for 2,565-square-feet of living space above grounds, plus another 4,210-square-feet spread across two floors below for three bedrooms, media and games and a recreation area with a wet bar and three-sided fireplace.
* Upscale appointments include hardwood and heated tile floors, granite counters and 10-foot ceilings, as well as a triple garage, elevator, wine cellar, sound and central vacuum systems.
* The main floor was arranged with a master bedroom with the largest of six bathrooms, a den, a formal dining room and an open living area with a gas fireplace shared with a combined family room and kitchen, which also has access to a terrace and laundry room.
The Agent's Take: "It's a bungalow, but then you can go down two floors and it has an elevator too," says agent Mark Evernden. "It has full panoramic mountain views the way it's engineered into the side of the hill."
The surrounding urban environment also spoke to buyers. "The demand for the area has escalated because of the opening of the Light Rail Transit that comes from downtown," Mr. Evernden notes.

Full text:   In Toronto's business community, people tend to know each other. Many sit on the same boards, making it all but inevitable that conflicts of interest might arise. But governance experts say it's the perceived conflicts that pose the biggest challenge
When Rob Prichard was hired by MGM Resorts to help lobby for a casino in downtown Toronto, he promptly declared a potential conflict of interest. Not just because he is a chairman of Metrolinx, the regional transit agency that is looking at the impact of a local gambling resort on gridlock. But because he is a director at Onex Corp., a private equity firm that has added its name to a growing list of casino bidders.
Onex's co-founder, Anthony Melman, took a leave from the board of Ontario Lottery and Gaming Corp. in January. His conflict wasn't with Onex, from which he retired nine years ago. His problem was that a client of his investment firm, which he runs with Belinda Stronach, is in the horse-racing business. Another Metrolinx director, meanwhile, was forced to recuse himself from casino chatter after his investment bank, TD Securities, was also hired on as a lobbyist for MGM.
The ongoing privatization of OLG, one of the biggest such efforts in provincial history, will call on industry to do everything from finance new casinos and own lottery machines to serve drinks and deal blackjack cards. Not surprisingly, it has become a magnet for the private sector. More than five dozen lobbyists are already jockeying on behalf of real estate companies, gambling software companies and international casino operators.
Managing this tangled web of corporate relations will be key to running a process that has already proven controversial, as players fend off concerns about rising crime and gambling addiction.
No one one understands this better than the man in the middle of the sell-off, Paul Godfrey. The OLG chairman has picked many members of his board, including Mr. Melman, Jason Melbourne, who went to high school with one of his sons, and Dale Lastman, a former director who is the son of former Toronto mayor Mel Lastman. Mr. Godfrey is also head of Postmedia Network Inc., chairs the board of a major real estate developer, and is vice-chairman of Baycrest Centre for Geriatric Care.
"I served a lot of years in public life," he told The Globe and Mail's editorial board. "No one's ever accused me of a conflict of interest."
The firewall Mr. Godfrey has erected between his dual roles at OLG and Postmedia is the kind of real conflict that's easy to deal with, say governance experts. The challenge is handling perceived conflicts and whether someone stands to benefit, especially with a restructuring project involving the financing, transportation and entertainment sectors.
"The perceived conflicts are all over the place here," said Richard Powers, academic director of the directors' education program at the Rotman School of Management. "The problem is they are often in the shadows."
Edward Sonshine, the chief executive officer of RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust and a close friend of Mr. Godfrey's, has publicly opposed a casino in downtown Toronto. Mr. Godfrey is chairman of the board at RioCan, a position he has held for 20 years. He said Mr. Sonshine made a management decision that had nothing to do with the board.
"How much more transparent can you be?" he said. "It shows that there is no internal influence. I didn't say, 'Bring it to the board and I'll lobby the members.'"
Other OLG directors have proactively avoided conflicts. Mr. Lastman, a partner at Goodmans LLP and adviser to construction magnate Larry Tanenbaum, was the only one of eight OLG directors who did not renew his term when it expired in February, 2012.
"It was always my intention to serve only one term of two years, and it was not more complicated than that," Mr. Lastman said in an e-mail to The Globe.
His timely departure allows him to avoid any conflicts at OLG itself. He also sits on the boards of RioCan and Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment. Mr. Tanenbaum, the chairman of MLSE, has expressed interest in a Toronto casino project.
Mr. Melman, the former partner of Onex chairman Gerald Schwartz, said it would be like "trying to have your cake and eat it" if he were to have simply recused himself from meetings at OLG while doing business with his client.
"I would love to stay on the board," he said in an interview. "But it's not about me and what I can do. It's about what's the right thing to do."
Mr. Prichard said he declared a conflict last year after Torys LLP, the law firm he chairs, accepted a retainer from MGM Resorts International, and has "recused myself ever since from all discussions at Onex about its potential casino and gaming investments."
He said he has taken "prophylactic steps" to avoid any conflicts by staying out of discussions at Metrolinx related to transportation and a casino as well as any meetings at MGM involving transit planning.
A second Metrolinx board member is also lobbying for MGM. TD Securities Inc. vice-chairman Doug Turnbull said he has asked to be excluded from any Metrolinx board discussions regarding a casino.
There is nothing wrong with having a conflict of interest, say governance experts. It is unavoidable in a small business community. It comes down to how individuals and organizations deal with them.
"How do I know if Paul Godfrey's decision is a good one?" said Chris MacDonald, director of the Jim Pattison Ethical Leadership Education and Research Program at Ryerson University. "I'm not even competent to judge his decisions, so I've really got to trust the process."
Mr. Godfrey, a prominent Progressive Conservative, was the governing Liberals' hand-picked choice to repair OLG's reputation and generate more money from gambling for the cash-strapped province. OLG contributed $1-billion to the province's coffers last year.
Mr. Godfrey stepped into an agency plagued with problems. He was appointed chairman in February, 2010, six months after former Ontario finance minister Dwight Duncan cleaned house at OLG, including firing the CEO, amid a scandal over expenses.
"I thought he was perfect," Mr. Duncan said. "I could easily appoint somebody who doesn't know the gaming industry, who has no possible conflict. But is that in the taxpayers' interest? I don't believe it is."

Abstract: The concession to operate Toronto's 407 ETR toll highway, which produces about two-and-a-half times the revenue now, is worth well north of $10-billion. The 407 has a longer concession, and its revenue growth rate is about twice as fast, so the multiple an investor would pay for such a stream would arguably be higher. Then again, the 407 concession requires operating the highway, and that includes many costs.

Full text:   berman@globeandmail.com
As the federal government looks to unveil its budget next week and seeks ways to close the deficit, there's one juicy asset sitting on the balance sheet that done right, investors would pay a big premium to get a piece of.
Nothing is hotter than commercial real estate and the cash flows that come from it. Real-estate investment trusts are soaring, and the returns investors will accept from rents are at all-time lows. People will ante up for rent income like never before.
In that environment, Canada's government has the makings of a very interesting real-estate play in the form of the airport lands it owns and leases to airport operators in big cities. Right now, that income stream is worth many billions.
The leases, which came into being when the government devolved airport management to not-for-profit local authorities about 10 years ago, run for 60 years. There is an option to extend another 20 years. When the leases are up, unless the authorities and the feds cut a new deal, the airports and all their improvements go back into federal hands with no financial obligation.
The growth in cash flow is steady, if unspectacular. According to Transport Canada, lease revenue was $270-million in the last fiscal year, and is expected to rise to $282.6-million this year. By the year ending 2015, it will be $308.7-million, the government estimates. That's a compound annual growth rate of almost 5 per cent.
What's that cash flow worth over that time? A whole lot.
The concession to operate Toronto's 407 ETR toll highway, which produces about two-and-a-half times the revenue now, is worth well north of $10-billion. The 407 has a longer concession, and its revenue growth rate is about twice as fast, so the multiple an investor would pay for such a stream would arguably be higher. Then again, the 407 concession requires operating the highway, and that includes many costs. There's not much in the way of operating costs for the government with the ground leases. It just sits there and collects the cheques. The operating expensairpes at airports are the airport authorities' problems.
The 407 gets a valuation based on roughly 18 times operating earnings. Use that on the airport rents, and you are looking at a value of roughly $5-billion.
There are cautionary tales against governments selling assets too cheaply. The best example is the 407, which has soared in value since Ontario sold it. If you believe the government could cash out up front some of that income stream from airport rents, you might consider a structure whereby the government keeps a hand in the game to benefit from any upside.
There are also people who hate the idea that the government charges big rents to airports (including the people who run airports). They argue it drives up the cost of flying by pushing up landing fees and other airport charges. And that, they say, hurts the country's economy. Any sale of an interest in the airport rent income stream would have to balance the commercial interests of the acquirer against the larger good, if that's possible.
But the fact remains that the rents are there. And they will be for many decades to come. No government has shown an appetite for changing the system.
Given that what investors will pay for such income streams is at an all-time high, if ever there was a time to look at this plan, it could be now.

Housing anxiety high despite signs of soft landing

Full text:   Canadian Real Estate Association report is expected to reflect continued cooling of market, with only a modest fall in prices
Many observers believe Canada's housing market is headed for a soft landing, but expect Friday's sales numbers to raise the worry meter regardless.
The market has been cooling markedly in the wake of new mortgage restrictions last summer, and a report expected Friday from the Canadian Real Estate Association will drive that point home.
"The Canadian housing market is undeniably cooling; the only question is whether it will come in for a soft or hard landing," said senior economist Benjamin Reitzes of BMO Nesbitt Burns Inc.
"We expect sales to remain weak through the rest of this year and prices to fall only modestly, putting us squarely in the soft landing camp."
Mr. Reitzes expects Friday's report to show that house sales across Canada sank 12.5 per cent in February from a year earlier, far more quickly than January's 5-per-cent dip.
Expect to see a drop in average prices of a "modest" 1 per cent, he said, while the Multiple Listing Service price index slows to growth of 2.6 per cent. That, Mr. Reitzes said, would "continue its gentle deceleration, consistent with a soft landing."
He bases his overall forecast on the several local real estate boards that have already reported February sales, which weren't pretty: Vancouver, the focus of housing market fears, posted a drop of 29.4 per cent from a year earlier, while the Toronto area struggled with a 15.4-per-cent decline.
"Calgary even succumbed to the national trend with sales down from a year ago for the first time in nearly two years," Mr. Reitzes said, adding that the expected modest decline in average prices shows support from a decline in new listings and suggests "the market is not as weak as sales figures indicate."
February's figures will be affected by the fact that 2012 was a leap year, so there was an extra selling day last year, skewing the comparison with last month.
"True, February sales were dented by the fact that 2012 was a leap year, which could have carved 4 per cent from the year-over-year tally," said Mr. Reitzes' colleague, BMO's chief economist Douglas Porter. "But there is no denying the soft underbelly for broader sales."
Some believe Finance Minister Jim Flaherty went too far with July's tighter mortgage rules, while others expect the impact to fade, as the effects of past changes eased over the course of several months. That would suggest a pickup can be expected, though whether it comes in time for the spring selling season is anyone's guess.

Full text:   Two senior ministers' murky role in the procurement process of a government project embroils a splintering party as election looms
gmason@globeandmail.com
As much as she may want to deny it, B.C. Premier Christy Clark has another serious problem on her hands. And it may take the resignation of two more of her cabinet ministers to properly deal with it.
Attorney-General Shirley Bond and Jobs Minister Pat Bell are at the centre of a swelling controversy over the role they are alleged to have played in influencing the acquisition of land and the procurement process for a government project in Prince George.
The matter took on a darker hue this week when it was revealed that a government official told the head of a public trust to rewrite a letter the latter had written that originally said a loan to a Prince George businessman and Liberal Party supporter was issued "at the request of two local ministers of the Crown." A second, sanitized version of the letter made no reference to the role that the ministers purportedly played in securing the loan for businessman Dan McLaren.
Mr. McLaren and a business associate, Brian Fehr, have alleged that Mr. Bell made promises and assurances to them that Mr. Fehr's proposal to build the government-tendered Wood Innovation and Design Centre on land purchased by Mr. McLaren would get shortlisted. The $8.9-million loan that Mr. McLaren secured from the Northern Development Initiative Trust (NDIT) is now in default.
Mr. Bell and Ms. Bond have both maintained they did nothing wrong. The Premier has been adamant in supporting two of her closest ministers. But that was before the latest revelation, which certainly raises more questions about the role the two powerful Prince George politicians might have played in this matter.
The NDIT is an independent, publicly funded financial organization mandated to promote infrastructure and economic development in northern B.C. As a former board member told The Globe and Mail, it's not in the business of financing land speculation deals. If it's going to hand out nearly $9-million to someone, it has to have solid assurances that it's not for some specious real-estate fishing expedition. Certainly, having the names of two prominent cabinet ministers associated with the loan request would ease the mind of a government lender.
At the crux of this controversy, however, is the allegation that Mr. Bell made a promise to these businessmen that if Mr. McLaren assembled land in downtown Prince George, he'd get Mr. Fehr on the short list to build the wood centre. And that he'd get the specifications of the bid changed to favour construction of the project on the site Mr. McLaren had purchased with the money from the loan.
Ms. Clark has said that B.C.'s fairness commissioner, who oversees public-sector tendering, looked at the process connected to the wood centre and concluded it was conducted fairly. That report is expected to be released in a couple of weeks. But some believe that all it proves is that the commissioner found the bid proceeded according to the rules and that specs were never changed to assist a particular proponent. It's unlikely, however, that she would have looked at whether there were any attempts made by Mr. Bell to have the terms of the bid altered - which is at the heart of this mess.
This is what is upsetting several members of the Liberal caucus, who want this issue properly investigated. It's believed by most that Mr. Bell has played a more significant role in this matter than Ms. Bond. In fact, at a recent caucus meeting, Liberal backbencher Randy Hawes asked Mr. Bell to step aside until he'd been cleared of wrongdoing by an independent overseer. Mr. Bell flatly rejected the proposition. Mr. Hawes's request was also scoffed at by fellow backbencher Kevin Krueger, who made a noisy show of protest.
But many in the Liberal ranks maintain serious doubts about this issue and the role Mr. Bell is purported to have played in it. Now Ms. Bond has been dragged into the picture in a serious way as well. More generally, several Liberal MLAs have expressed concern that the government has lost its moral compass and that the Premier's refusal to have the ministers step aside until this case can be investigated thoroughly is another example of that.
This past week, Multiculturalism Minister John Yap was asked to step aside in the ethnic-vote scandal, even though there was no evidence that he had any role to play in it. Certainly he faced nothing like the allegations now swirling around ministers Bond and Bell in the wood-centre affair. There seems to be one set of standards for certain ministers and another for others, depending on your place in cabinet and your association with the Premier.
If there is nothing to this story, as Ms. Bond and Mr. Bell insist, it would take a respected arbiter little time to get to the bottom of it. But until that is done, the ministers and their government remain under a cloud.

LISTING AGENT
Mary Jo Vradis, Royal LePage Estate Realty
The Action: In a residential community hugging the south side of the Don Valley Parkway before winding downtown, this detached residence welcomed two open houses with over 30 buyers each time. With a shortage of other alternatives, it sold relatively swiftly in less than two weeks.
What They Got: In 2009, a roughly 50-year-old bungalow was topped up with a second floor so it encompasses 1,460 square feet of living space, including an office area in the largest of three upper bedrooms, as well as a new access point to reach the deck from both the kitchen and a 700-square-foot basement with a fireside recreation room.
* Accommodating short or long-term guests is easy with open living and dining areas with laminate floors and nine-foot ceiling, three bathrooms and two-car parking on the 32-by-100-foot property.
The Agent's Take: "It's in Woodbine Heights, so it's a nice little pocket with lots of new homes in the area," agent Mary Jo Vradis said. "And it's right off the DVP, which is a big selling feature for young, first-time buyers."
This house is also typical of the local housing stock. "It doesn't really need any work, it was in move-in condition," Ms. Vradis added. "It had a private driveway, which was a nice bonus."

Full text:   A Brazilian filmmaker makes a hair-raising debut with a social study of wealth and class that is filled with dread
Neighbouring Sounds
Directed and written by Kleber Mendonca Filho
Starring Gustavo Jahn, Maeve Jinkings, W.J. Solha and Irandhir Santos
Classification: N/A
****
In movie thrillers, as opposed to the real-estate market, it may be that dislocation is everything. And rarely have the connections between property development and dread been so well-captured as in Neighbouring Sounds , the subtle, hair-raising debut from young Brazilian filmmaker Kleber Mendonca Filho. Economically packed with social issues of wealth, property and class, and deft cinematic references, this is a movie built for the modern global condo market.
The script follows a group of characters living in the kind of buildings that are derisively referred to as "cocaine towers" in Latin America. The setting is the booming city of Recife, on the northeastern bump of Brazil, set in a high-rise development surrounded by security cameras, where the residents live in cookie-cutter, open-concept apartments with flat-screen TVs, floor-to-ceiling windows and narrow corridors, stacked atop each other like hatchlings in incubator boxes.
As an acerbic social study, Filho's film evokes both Robert Altman and Luis Bunuel, but it is also filled with its own flavour of dread. Much of that derives from the insinuating sound design, referred to in the film's title. Off-screen, we hear the constant rattle of construction work, sirens, children's screams, unidentified footsteps. As in all wealthy enclaves, there's a particular emphasis on security from invaders: The movie is divided into chapters titled Guard Dogs, Night Guards and Body Guards. With so much protection around, something bad must be about to happen.
Most of the dozen-plus characters here are well-off, though there's a separate society of maids, security guards and delivery men who cater to the residents' needs. (This is the sort of place where a condo with maid's quarters seems to be included in the base package.) The relationships between masters and servants are collegial, even familial, which makes the sudden moments of cruelty all the more startling. Maids are sharply reprimanded, sometimes in front of their children, as if they were children themselves. An aging servant is suddenly replaced by her daughter; the condo board debates whether to fire their aging security man without severance, after one of the tenants' kids videotapes the old man napping.
The recurring protagonist is a handsome, mild-natured Joao (Gustavo Jahn), a wealthy scion of the family that built the development, who has returned from Europe and is now working in his grandfather's business as a property agent. Early on, we see Joao waking up in his condo with a girl he hooked up with the night before, Sofia (Irma Brown), who grew up in the neighbourhood before it went vertical.
Shortly after they wake, the maid arrives with her grandchildren in tow - their mother had a doctor's appointment. The kids watch cartoons while grandma jokes and prepares the lovers' breakfasts.
After breakfast, Joao takes Sofia back to her car where they discover her side window has been removed and her CD player stolen. Joao, concerned about disappointing his new potential girlfriend, makes it his mission to find out who is responsible. He interrogates a couple of local guys he sees washing a car and gets annoyed when they seem to be playing dumb. That's because all of them suspect the same person, Joao's trouble-prone cousin, Dinho (Yuri Holanda).
Joao's grandfather, Francisco (W.J. Solha), a powerful patriarch who suggests the character of Noah Cross in Roman Polanski's Chinatown , made his fortune in sugar-cane plantations before moving into real estate. He now lives in one of the condo boxes with his maid, ruling his empire via his cellphone.
When a slick private-security salesman, Clodoaldo (Irandhir Santos), shows up on the block selling a group deal for street protection, they know they must first get Francisco's approval. He gives it to them, with the warning that they leave Dinho alone. Soon, the neighbours chip in, paying a few dollars a month to have what appears to be a pointless street patrol. The security guards, who sit talking in a tent protected from the rain, wear quasi-military uniforms. In the film's first half, their most taxing job is to help a confused party-goer find his way back to the condo that he just left.
Joao's work, too, seems casual: A woman and her daughter come to see a unit. "It looks like a factory," says the woman. The potential buyer tries to bargain him down because she heard a woman threw herself off the balcony to her death and wants a discount for the "negative energy." Joao rejects her pitch: "This place isn't haunted," he assures her.
Later, after closing a deal with another buyer, he finds a loose nut on a terrace and thoughtfully pockets it. Did something break loose?
The most unhappy resident is Beatriz (Maeve Jinkings), a sultry, bored mother of two children who are doing extra classes in Mandarin and English to assure their future. She takes pleasure from her household machines: When the kids are away, she gets pot from the water delivery man and exhales the fumes into her vacuum cleaner. Then she presses herself against the vibrating washing machine.
Beatriz's great source of torment in life is a Weimaraner guard dog in the courtyard below. The neighbours leave it out at night, where it howls piteously. She drugs it by putting her sleeping pills in a piece of raw meat, blasts Queen's Crazy Little Thing Called Love to drown it out, and later, imports a high-frequency siren to torment the creature.
Neighbouring Sounds is a deceptively understated film that keeps ratcheting up the tension through details and suggestive moments as Filho, the archetypal director as puppet master, quietly lays down the clues that show how the alienation of the present has its roots in the past.
In the film's extraordinary third act, Joao and Sophia go with the grandfather, Francisco, to the old man's country place in the mountains, next to a crumbling ghost town near the old plantation site. What happened here? We never exactly know, but the result was devastation. There's a scene where all three of them shower under a waterfall, yelling in the freezing water with the sheer intensity of the experience. After, they return to the city and their disturbingly safe boxes in the sky, to await the next step in their fates.

Full text:   Poor Prince al-Waleed Bin Talal. One of the world's wealthiest men has announced a billionaire's strike against Forbes magazine because it doesn't think he's as rich as he claims to be. In its annual ranking of global billionaires, Forbes valued the Saudi investor at $20-billion (U.S.). He says he's worth closer to $30-billion, and will "sever ties" with Forbes, which he accuses of using a different methodology to count his wealth than other billionaires - and of applying an anti-Middle Eastern bias.
Forbes is right and the royal is wrong - but this is more than an amusing side-show between a magazine and a narcissistic billionaire. It is a reminder that investors in emerging economies need to question the fortitude and effectiveness of regulators in those markets to ensure they're sound places to put their money.
Valuing the wealthy is a tricky business, more art than science. I can speak from experience - when I oversaw the creation of Canadian Business' Rich 100 list in 1999, we explained the practice was "more of an educated guessing game" - and was influenced by how Forbes compiled its data. Valuing public holdings was easy given the abundance of regulatory disclosures. Privately held companies and real estate were trickier: where the subject didn't provide financial data (and many did), we would estimate cash flows, earnings, sales and other metrics based on conversations with industry experts, and apply standard industry multiples to value them. One or two list members provided data that seemed a bit inflated, so we discounted the figures in our calculations. One such individual complained that he should have ranked higher.
Of course, vigilance is important when rich-list compilers face subjects who not only want to be on it, but to place highly. Such is the case with the prince, according to an exceptional piece in Forbes explaining its reasons for the lowball valuation. The key issue is the value of the prince's Kingdom Holding Co. The prince loaded most of his holdings into Kingdom and then floated a five per cent stake on the Saudi stock market in 2007. But every year, the stock mysteriously shoots up in the weeks prior to Forbes' set valuation date.
In the article, Forbes looked more closely at the company's underlying assets and expressed serious doubts about the values, based on the performance of underlying publicly traded assets - and the questionable valuation of private holdings. In addition, Kingdom's former auditor Ernst & Young noted a discrepancy between the market and holding value of stocks in 2009 and 2010; in 2011, the Kingdom employed a different auditor, PricewaterhouseCoopers.
"In light of the Kingdom's opacity, small float and thin, questionable trading," Forbes said, it is instead individually valuing Kingdom's underlying assets, leading to its $20-billion valuation. This is more than changing the rules of an educated guessing game: Forbes raises serious, legitimate issues about an important public company on a regional stock exchange, implying the possibility of stock price manipulation, reporting deficiencies and lack of regulatory oversight.
This should be a good wake-up call for the world's emerging economies: if you want to be taken seriously as a place to invest, your regulators need to live up to the standards of their developed economy peers - even if it means peeving a local prince.

Abstract: Sales of existing homes in the greater Toronto area were 15-per-cent lower in February than a year ago, the local real estate board said Tuesday. There were 5,759 sales during the month, down from 6,809 in the same month during 2012.

Full text:   Sales of existing homes in the greater Toronto area were 15-per-cent lower in February than a year ago, the local real estate board said Tuesday. There were 5,759 sales during the month, down from 6,809 in the same month during 2012. However, the Toronto Real Estate Board noted that 2012 was a leap year and had one extra day in February. Adjusting to compare a 28-day-period last year to a 28-day-period this year results in a sales decline of 10.5 per cent, it said. Either way it's clear the market has not rebounded from the steep slowdown in sales during the second half of last year. Finance Minister Jim Flaherty tightened mortgage insurance rules last summer in a bid to stem the growth of house prices, amid fears the market was growing too hot.

The Action: In a rural setting across from McCleery Golf Course, this custom equestrian estate drew more than 40 showings. Over the course of several months last year, the price was gradually reduced from $13.5-million to $11.8-million. Despite a marketing program that included exposure abroad, a local buyer negotiated the clinching offer.
What They Got: In 2009, a 2.44-acre lot was redeveloped for this 7,041-square-foot residence with more than half a dozen walkouts to private patios, a riding ring and a 1,179-square-foot stable. Designer Steve Tidball included eight stalls, a lounge, kitchen and caretaker's suite upstairs with one bedroom, bathroom, cooking and entertaining areas.
* Architect John Hollifield and designer David Drummond Clarke formed the creative team behind the lavish design of the main house - a French Chateau-inspired home with fireside living and family rooms, formal dining space and a recreation area with a steam shower and change room.
* The gourmet eat-in kitchen has two islands, a pantry and prep area, a mudroom to the double garage and two staircases to an upper laundry room, second office and five bedrooms, including a master retreat with a walk-in closet, balcony, fireplace and the largest of the home's seven bathrooms.
The Agent's Take: "It was two-years-old and architect-designed with beautiful quality, and it had outstanding equestrian facilities - I used to call it the Four Seasons of barns - and the training facility was fantastic," says agent Greg Carros.
"It's rare in Canada and the world where you have equestrian facilities in the centre of a city."
This also meant the owner won't have to travel far to reach amenities, whether waterfront trails or manicured greens.
"The golf course was right across the street and a riding club is right down the road," Mr. Carros adds. "It's 10 or 15 minutes to everything."

Abstract: According to many American reviewers, Kathryn Bigelow's drama about the decade-long hunt for Osama Bin Laden is a cathartic and serious exploration of the dark post-9/11 decade, but according to the film's political critics, it's effectively a public-relations exercise exonerating the CIA for its intelligence failures and torture. Bigelow's film is a high-tension, engrossing procedural, with characterization and political context stripped away.

Amour
****
A well-off cultured Parisian couple struggle with the ravages of age and illness in Michael Haneke's drama, which won Palme d'Or at the 65th Cannes film festival in May. Unlike such recent Haneke films as Caché or The White Ribbon , there is no puzzle or political message here, just a portrait of decline, rendered with an uncharacteristic tenderness. The long-married couple are embodied by two living luminaries of French cinema: 82-year-old Jean-Louis Trintignant and 85-year-old Emmanuelle Riva. PG (Jan. 11) Liam Lacey
Argo
***
Ben Affleck's accomplished third feature as a director, and best picture Oscar winner, is set against the background of the Iranian revolution. Affleck stars as Tony Mendez, the CIA agent who concocted an improbable plan to free six Americans, sheltered in the Canadian ambassador's home, by pretending they were part of the crew for a fake movie named Argo . The snappy dialogue and suspense occasionally feel forced, but sharp comic turns from Alan Arkin and John Goodman as Hollywood veterans and a well-controlled sense of pace make this a savvy crowd-pleaser. 14A (Oct. 12) L.L.
Django Unchained
**½
Quentin Tarantino's slave-era spaghetti western revenge film features his usual brilliant trademarks - the perfectly calibrated action set pieces, flavourful dialogue and richly over-the-top performances - but the gravity of the subject risks being obscured here by exploitation excesses, juvenile humour and a needlessly long running time. The best reasons to watch are the mirrored performances by Leonardo DiCaprio and Christoph Waltz. 18A (Dec. 21) L.L.
Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters
*
Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton play the grown-up siblings from the Brothers Grimm fairy tale in this genre-spoofing action film that's part of the same wave that has seen Abraham Lincoln and Jane Austen fighting vampires and zombies. Shot in 3-D, with lots of choppy action, a rudimentary plot and plenty of CGI shape-shifting, it comes in at a disposable 88 minutes. Suggested alternative title: Crone Wars . 14A (Jan. 25) L.L.
Les Miserables
***
You don't have to go to the barricades for Tom Hooper's adaptation of the hit stage musical to appreciate it for what it is - a productive experiment, an epic-scaled weepie, an exercise in sincere kitsch. Hooper ( The King's Speech ) and the cast get full credit for commitment to the cause. The principal here is It's the Emotions, Stupid, as the actors sing directly to the camera in less than musically perfect but dramatic fashion. This technique, straight from the heart and tonsils, works most effectively on the musical's famous number, I Dreamed A Dream , by Anne Hathaway as the dying prostitute. Otherwise, Hugh Jackman does most of the musical heavy lifting. PG (Dec. 21) L.L.
Life of Pi
****
Every once in a long while, the right director comes across the right project at just the right moment. So it is with Ang Lee and Life of Pi . The director has mastered the shiny technology (dazzling 3-D, ferociously credible CGI) the story needs. Without that mastery, Yann Martel's magically realistic fable, in which a boy and a tiger share an adventure at sea, could never make the transition from page to screen. The story also offers the director the deeper themes he craves. Without such depth, the film could never make its own leap from entertainment to art. PG (Nov. 21) Rick Groen
Lincoln
***½
Steven Spielberg directs, but really this is a Tony Kushner film, the playwright who wrote the wordy but intricately layered script, and a Daniel Day-Lewis film, the actor who so richly embodies the iconic title role. Capturing the events that led to the passage of the 13th amendment abolishing slavery, Lincoln is a superbly dramatized political essay. Yes, it's a movie about people talking in rooms. And the talk fascinates. PG (Nov. 9) R.G.
Parker
**½
Director Taylor Hackford struggles to capture the hard-boiled tone of the 1960s heist and caper novels written by Donald Westlake (a.k.a. Richard Stark) in the setting of a contemporary big-budget action movie. The film delivers thrills efficiently but without much-needed humour. British action star Jason Statham is perfect as the ruthless yet honourable Parker stealing a big jewel theft out from under associates who have double-crossed him. Jennifer Lopez can't do the desperation needed to portray the down-on-her-luck real estate agent who helps him. 14A (Jan. 25) Kate Taylor
Side Effects
***
Steven Soderbergh's latest, and according to the director final film, is no grand swan song. But it is a clever genre film, demonstrating his ability to lend an artful edge to familiar material. Jude Law stars as a British-born Manhattan psychiatrist and Rooney Mara as his patient, a young woman suffering from depression upon the release of her husband (Channing Tatum) from prison. The corkscrew plot gets a bit out of control but the well-tuned performances send a modest buzz to the pleasure centres. 14A (Feb. 8) L.L.
Silver Linings Playbook
***
David O. Russell's panicky new comedy stars Bradley Cooper as a bipolar teacher, recently out of a psychiatric hospital, who maintains the deluded belief he is destined to reconcile with his estranged wife. While living back at home with his parents (Robert De Niro and Jacki Weaver), he makes a deal with a local (Jennifer Lawrence), who promises to help him in exchange for a favour. More sentimental and conventional than Russell's earlier comedies, the performances throughout are first rate, with Lawrence a particular stand-out in her first grown-up role. 14A (Nov. 21) L.L.
Warm Bodies
**½
A zombie boy (Nicholas Hoult) falls for a human girl (Teresa Palmer) in this updated version of the Romeo and Juliet story, set in a post-apocalyptic future. But what if true love can bring zombies back to life? Jonathan Levine ( 50/50 ) adapted the story from the young-adult novel by Isaac Marion in this good-natured younger sibling to the Twilight saga. PG (Feb. 1) L.L.
Zero Dark Thirty
***
According to many American reviewers, Kathryn Bigelow's drama about the decade-long hunt for Osama Bin Laden is a cathartic and serious exploration of the dark post-9/11 decade, but according to the film's political critics, it's effectively a public-relations exercise exonerating the CIA for its intelligence failures and torture. Bigelow's film is a high-tension, engrossing procedural, with characterization and political context stripped away. But the critics are right - the emphasis on the personal vindication of Maya (Jessica Chastain) makes a heroine out of a war criminal, and the movie is morally tone-deaf on torture. 14A (Jan. 11) L.L.

Full text:   Easily dismissed, the mid-century modern structures designed by architect Peter Dickinson may be worth a second look
jmays@globeandmail.com
The British-born architect Peter Dickinson came to Toronto in 1949, and worked here until 1961, when death took him, at age 36. In the dozen years of an extraordinarily prolific career, he dotted the local landscape with buildings that were hailed at the time as gems of festive, svelte design - the Benvenuto Place apartments, the Inn on the Park (demolished), Beth Tzedec Synagogue, and numerous others.
But Mr. Dickinson did more than put up memorable structures. He also created a circle of admirers who kept alive public interest in his work when mid-century Modernism went out of fashion, and who have persisted down to the present day. Indeed, to know and like the art of Peter Dickinson is part of what it means to be a savvy citizen of Hogtown these days. In a way unmatched by another architect active here in the 1950s, he matters deeply.
So it's hardly surprising to find a considerable number of townsfolk dismayed by the prospect of seeing Dickinson buildings swept away. The structures I'm thinking of are the three remaining towers (of an original five) in Regent Park, the large former public housing complex now undergoing massive transformation into a mixed-income, public-private neighbourhood.
Each of these award-winning blocks is a 14-storey stack of spacious two-level apartments that spread across the entire width of the building. When I visited one of the three-bedroom suites a few years ago, I found it to be a fine, honest expression of what mattered to the humane modern architects of mass housing in Mr. Dickinson's day: excellent cross-ventilation, copious natural lighting, density without a sacrifice of privacy, and a strong sense of the social and communal. If the elevators were not kept in working order as time went by, if mindful maintenance was allowed to slide, if poverty wrecked the lives of the inhabitants - none of that is the fault of the architecture, which embodies a style of serious social conscience that should never be forgotten.
Yet, by the end of 2013, Toronto could lose important traces of Peter Dickinson's moral and artistic legacy. In an e-mail sent to me last week, Thomas Burr, Regent Park's development director, described the current state of play: "Two of the five towers were demolished in 2011, and three remain. Toronto Community Housing [TCH, the landlord of Regent Park] intends to seek City approval to demolish the remaining three buildings later this year as part of phase three of revitalization."
But, as Mr. Burr went on to explain, the razing of all three towers could be frustrated by a combination of forces. One will probably come from the heritage lobby, or there might even be a public outcry. The city has placed Mr. Dickinson's block at 14 Blevins Place on its list of "heritage properties," a fact that will serve as leverage by a person or group inclined to save the slab. Also, an independent design review panel, charged with vetting every move in the Regent Park overhaul, is expected to return an expert opinion on the matter "in the coming months." It could vote to preserve the building.
TCH, it should be noted, is not simply hell-bent on bulldozing everything standing in the way of its bright, shiny redevelopment scheme. Years ago, when the "revitalization" was in its earliest stages, the public agency promised to consider sparing 14 Blevins Place (if not the other four Dickinson projects). TCH has made good on its promise: Mr. Burr said in his e-mail that the organization has initiated "three studies to determine whether there is any viable re-purposing of the building."
One thing is certain: If 14 Blevins is left standing, it will indeed be "repurposed," and its current career, as social housing, will end. "We have received very clear direction from the community who live in 14 Blevins that they do not like the building," Mr. Burr said. "There are real issues about retaining the building as social housing, and the ward councillor has indicated that the building should not remain in its current use."
So what could it become? "We know from market analyses and architectural studies," Mr. Burr said, "that the building is not viable for a conversion to a market condominium building, and any efforts to modify the building to meet current energy efficiency standards will significantly alter the functionality of the suites, and the exterior of the building, thus eliminating the original design intent."
TCH's official prediction for the fate of 14 Blevins Place is obviously bleak. But what do you think? Please e-mail me your schemes, sketches, dreams for renewing Dickinson's tower - the more imaginative the better. In a future column, I'll showcase the best of your notions. Until you've weighed in, I think TCH should put on hold its plan to bulldoze what's left of Mr. Dickinson's Regent Park legacy. We might all be surprised by the good ideas you come up with.

Full text:   A frankly contemporary home revamps the new suburbanism of a landmark Toronto neighbourhood
abozikovic@globeandmail.com
When she was a little girl, Kimberly Au saw Don Mills as a kind of wonderland. Visiting her aunt and uncle, who lived in the neighbourhood, "I'd wander through all these connected parks on my little purple tricycle," she recalls. "It was so green, so beautiful, and I always said, 'Wow!'"
Now she just has to look out her windows to get the same feeling: She now lives with her husband and daughter in a Don Mills house that backs onto one of the neighbourhood's "greenway" parks.
They commissioned the house from architect Cheryl Atkinson to take full advantage of the site.
With a lush courtyard, lots of glass and a layout carefully sculpted to build on the strengths of the lot, it offers a contemporary update on the verdant suburban living that Don Mills was designed 50 years ago to offer.
Ms. Au and her husband, Kenneth So, started planning this house while they were still childless, living in a loft in the Entertainment District.
The couple was seeking a frankly contemporary house with room for a family and, of course, "it was important for us to bring the outside in," Ms. Au says.
For Ms. Atkinson, who was then working at the high-design firm Teeple Architects, this all sounded like common sense. "They had lived in a condo, and they were used to contemporary living. Every detail I suggested, they said, 'Of course.'"
This is, in one sense, an ideal place for inventive architecture. Don Mills, including the recently transformed Don Mills Centre a few blocks away, is ground zero for Modernist residential design in Canada. Its planning and development in the postwar period included some of the brightest young minds in Canadian design.
On the other hand, the street where Mr. So and Ms. Au bought was filled with mediocre builders' housing, bungalows that could have landed in any postwar subdivision.
They had theirs torn down, and with Ms. Atkinson and local master builder Derek Nicholson, they set out to thoughtfully build new.
The budget was relatively modest, and they didn't want their home to reach monster-home scale.
Ms. Atkinson's most important response was to put a twist on the typical Toronto house.
Rather than a long, narrow box with windows front and back, she suggested a house that stretched lengthwise across the lot.
"This means you take advantage of the back views, with a south exposure over the park," she says.
Then, she suggested carving away a front corner of the house and placing a courtyard in the middle.
These are straightforward ideas, but they make the act of entering the house rather complex. From the street, you see a front façade of grey ironspot brick and cedar siding.
Then you walk past it to turn a corner into the courtyard - lushly landscaped with groundcovers, grasses and Japanese maples.
Here is the front door, which in turn brings you into a glass-lined, two-storey foyer.
"We were trying to make a combined space and bring the courtyard in by dematerializing the facade," Ms. Atkinson says. The large glass panes (standard commercial windows) do this, bringing the courtyard and the adjacent rooms into an ensemble.
From here, the logic of the 2,700-square-foot house's design becomes clear. In the front wing is a living room, with a bedroom above; in the the rear wing is a kitchen and dining room, with two bedrooms above.
Tucked in behind a wall by the door is a powder room and closet. Ms. Atkinson put these "servant spaces," as she calls them, borrowing from the great architect Louis Kahn, in their own separate area to clarify the plan of the other rooms. It works very well. (Mr. So, an eager handyman, has built out the downstairs powder room himself. An IT professional, he is also clearly a pretty good tiler and woodworker.)
Above the foyer, a bridge made of glass and cold-rolled steel connects the two wings. The rear one is the showcase, an expansive, but perfectly proportioned, space with large windows that bring in vistas of the yard, and the park beyond.
"Everyone wants a large room to live and entertain, so we arranged it sideways to make a very large room," Ms. Atkinson says wryly.
Here as elsewhere, you are never far from a window.
"Almost every room in this house has windows on three sides," she says, "and that makes a tremendous difference to the experience of the house."
From the living room and kitchen, the backyard, the park and the sky are all very present, as in all the best Modernist houses.
The room's large scale is broken up by an informal mix of materials.
A glass pendant lamp by Vancouver's Bocci hangs over a massive dining table made from a live-edge walnut slab that the couple picked out themselves at a lumberyard in Cambridge. A few vintage touches - a teak sideboard, an ancient Telefunken radio, a Modernist brass wall hanging - lend some spice to the building's grey slate floors and black-framed aluminum windows.
Next door is the kitchen, but, Ms. Au says, "We didn't want the kitchen to look like a kitchen." So Ms. Atkinson designed it with no upper cabinets; instead there's just a beautiful shelf in walnut, fabricated to match the rest of the kitchen by millworker Kent Aggus. The countertops are in Calacatta Oro, a marble that has a rich chocolate-milk quality.
The interior is enriched by the views of the surrounding environment. Upstairs, the couple's master bedroom gets the same vistas, only improved by height: a corner window and balcony look over the greenway, "so we almost feel like it belongs to us," Ms. Au says.
This is a payoff of the promise that brought them, like so many before them, to Don Mills. And now that they have a young daughter, another set of young legs is exploring that rich, green landscape - while returning to a home that is just as beautifully made as the landscape.

LISTING AGENT
Ed Allan, Royal LePage West Realty Group Ltd.
The Action: Three parties applied to buy this two-bedroom and one-bathroom bungalow, which largely captured the interest of locals hoping to stay in the Etobicoke community.
What They Got: This detached, brick residence is about 60 years old but has undergone many changes in recent years, from eliminating a third bedroom to updating the kitchen, windows, roof, heating and cooling systems. Plus, the driveway was repaved and the garage roof was replaced.
Public quarters inside include formal living and dining rooms and more casual family room and sun room off the master suite with walkouts to a south-facing yard on the 40-by-141-foot lot, along with a lower-level office, workshop and fireside recreation room.
The Agent's Take: "It's a big lot and the person who bought the house is going to spend a lot of money rebuilding, or may even tear the house down," says agent Ed Allan, whose seen as many as 20 older homes demolished on the street in recent years.
"The biggest selling feature of that house was that it has a two-car garage in the backyard with a concrete floor. It was perfect. You could make it into an art or recording studio."
Though many homes on the street may be new, local amenities are well-established attractions.
"It's near Islington [Avenue], so it's a five-minute bus ride to the subway, it's also near good shopping, good schools and the Queensway theatre district where there's a big Cineplex and restaurants around it," adds Mr. Allan.

Full text:   ARCHITECTURE CRITIC
The Royal Ontario Museum is planning to soften the edges of its jagged face.
The museum occupies a valuable block of real estate in downtown Toronto, as well as a critical piece of the city's consciousness. Re-imagining its public space - an initiative that could cost an estimated $3-million - has the potential to offer a genteel pedestrian lounge to tourists as well as tony locals sashaying in and out of the luxury strip's couture boutiques.
The stripped-back plaza unveiled along with the hulking ROM "crystal" in 2007 suffered from a lack of funds, though at least the hydro lines were buried and out of sight.
The new plan for a sweeping three-sided public space that will integrate trees, urban furniture and simple, imaginative ideas of public comfort is entirely fitting: After all, half of the museum is dedicated to nature - the other to the triumphs and weight of civilization.
The idea is loosely inspired by the civic grace of Place des Vosges in Paris and is playfully called: "menage à trois."
Daniel Libeskind, the architect responsible for the aluminum-clad "crystal" that juts over Bloor Street, will not be part of the design team. Instead the acclaimed Toronto studio Hariri Pontarini Architects and the lauded Montreal landscape architect Claude Cormier, who recently charmed the public with his joyous work at Sugar Beach, will handle the designs.
The reinvention of public space would stretch from Philosopher's Walk east along Bloor Street West and turn the corner at the Queen's Park boulevard. Visitors would experience new sophisticated seating beneath the shelter provided by lush canopies of trees. Signage would be improved to help lead people north from the Museum subway station.
"We want the ROM to be a really great part of the community. We want people to think well of us," said Kelvin Browne, the museum's vice-president of communications. "We want to make the best possible experience for visitor. The plaza has the potential to be more used and more comfortable than it is."
Mr. Browne would like to bring the standards of public-space delight up to the level of detailing and engagement showcased next door at the transformed Royal Conservatory of Music - a stunning integration of a historic building with a new light-filled atrium and concert hall space. East of Avenue Road, the revitalization of Bloor Street has also introduced European standards of tree planting and granite pavers.
"We're rethinking the whole notion of sidewalk, public space and institution to give to Toronto that slow, wonderful experience that you get now in New York or in Europe, where you sit and have a conversation," said design lead Siamak Hariri, who is also the lead architect on the Faculty of Law transformation project just south of the ROM. "That's simply not the case on Queen's Park and not even on Bloor."
The museum needs to take the Hariri/Cormier designs out to interested sponsors to secure the millions of dollars required for the serious revitalization of public space.
There may not be any money so far in the public-space coffers, but the museum has set an ambitious completion date: March 19, 2014, in time for the ROM's centennial celebration.

Full text:   Davisville Junior Public School, a stout brown-brick structure with weathered white trim, holds fewer than 400 students.
There is nothing remarkable about this small elementary school, in other words, but for one big wrinkle: The academy is at the centre of a high-stakes battle between a cash-starved school board and the guardians of the city's skyline.
The Toronto District School Board, creaking under the pressure of labour unrest and the controversial resignation of its director over plagiarism charges, is facing a crushing $3.2-billion maintenance backlog.
Desperate to turn the tide and raise the money it needs for important repairs, the board is turning to its most valuable asset - land. It has zeroed in on six schools with property that could be sold and developed.
The Davisville school land, a valuable midtown plot just off Yonge Street, is the crown jewel in the board's grand plan, a vision that includes a brand-new school built into a 12-storey condo tower.
But city officials are resisting, arguing the plan is an affront to rules that protect neighbourhoods from hungry developers. With the cash-starved board willing to go to the mat, the fate of this small, aging school could determine how Toronto balances its need for strong schools with its promise to control growth.
"This is going to be a scenario that we're going to see come up across the city," said Ward 22 Councillor Josh Matlow, a former school trustee for the district. "The school board has a sincere and honest interest in repairing its facilities. The city has a sincere and honest interest in protecting its neighbourhoods. And the question is: Where do these two interests meet?"
No one disputes the financial pressure the school board faces. The TDSB has for years at budget time deferred spending on regular repairs and upkeep to its schools in an effort to avoid layoffs, school closures, cuts to programming and other undesirable measures that would otherwise be needed to balance the books.
And all involved agree the students of Davisville could use a new home. The school was built in 1962, partly to accommodate the Metro Toronto School for the Deaf, and is showing its wear with $8.3-million in needed repairs.
Board trustee Shelley Laskin is confident there is still time to convince stakeholders that the structure and the new school will bring "tremendous benefits from a community perspective," as the cash gained from selling land will be used on modern buildings and renovated playgrounds. (The recent redevelopment of North Toronto Secondary School near Yonge and Eglinton, where tall towers are permitted, netted the TDSB nearly $23-million, and many now consider it a success in spite of the early opposition that dogged that project.)
But in addition to city planners, among the stakeholders who will need convincing are parents and residents, who flatly rejected the TDSB's initial proposals for a 30- or 20-storey tower. Though the city's official plan caps buildings in the area at four storeys, they seem more willing to contemplate the latest design.
"We really focused on ensuring we had the same amount of green space - so we didn't lose any space for the kids - and that it was going to be dramatically improved," said Lisa Kelleher, a parent who sat on the project's Local School Community Design Team. "Yes, 12 storeys seems unusual on that land, but if it's on the south side, adjacent to 25-storey apartment buildings, it doesn't feel quite so off."
The final design isn't the only contentious factor: The way the board has led consultations while doggedly pursuing its goal has also raised a few hackles. "I very much thought the board was getting ahead of itself," said Rob McCready, the past chair of the Davisville school council, who has sons in grades 3 and 5. "I get the impression that there's been a sort of magical thinking during the process. ... Now they're running up against these issues and instead of dealing with them steadily and just working through them, they seem to want to just plow on ahead."
The board's plan hinges on a liberal interpretation of strict city planning rules. While the Davisville school sits in a low-rise neighbourhood-designated area, much taller apartment buildings sit just across the street on Davisville Avenue's south side, because that land is designated for high-rises. A document prepared by the Toronto Lands Corp., a subsidiary of the TDSB that manages its real-estate revenue, argues that mid-sized buildings like the proposed 12-storey Davisville tower "can provide a natural transition between neighbourhoods."
But the city's official plan was designed to clearly separate zones where planners want to promote growth from areas that need protection from the kind of development that would allow towering buildings and an influx of traffic to encroach on quiet streets lined with houses. David Oikawa, manager of the midtown section of City of Toronto Planning, said the disparity in what's allowed on either side of a street like Davisville Avenue is deliberate, and exceptions are very rare.
"We think streets are good boundaries, because there can be no dispute whether you're on one side of the street or the other," Mr. Oikawa said. "As soon as you're saying, 'We just want what's allowed across the street,' then the person who's behind that property is going to say, 'I just want what's next to me.' So it would just keep going and going and going."
Anticipating that they'll be accused of setting a bad planning precedent, the TDSB plans to ask the city for a "policy amendment" - essentially a set of criteria under which they could receive special consideration of official plan exceptions for schools on the edge of low-rise neighbourhoods, without paving the way for other developers to build higher next door. But Mr. Matlow says that ignores the complexity of the official plan, which was carefully considered and is deliberately strict.
He promised to "oppose [the board's application for an official plan amendment] very strongly," and says he has his fellow councillors' support.

THE MYTH OF FOREIGN BUYERS

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/myth-foreign-buyers/docview/1296425848/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "The mythology is that there are hordes of investors coming in Vancouver and driving up prices," said Cameron Muir, chief economist at the British Columbia Real Estate Association. "The only data that we have available suggests that there's anywhere from 1 to 4 per cent of sales across Metro Vancouver that are foreign investors - from all sources. A couple of per cent, in terms of exposure to foreign investment, is not going to drive any investment."

Full text:   Despite 'persistent' perceptions by some, research firms suggest a small percentage of foreign buyers has negligible impact on driving property prices in Vancouver. Andrea Woo reports
The ruse went sideways not long after the broadcasts aired. Two sisters, identified as eager home buyers, perused a downtown Vancouver condo development in news segments about a spike in sales over the Lunar New Year. If they liked the suite, the sisters said, their parents - visiting from China - would purchase it for them.
What followed was a PR disaster. Observant web sleuths identified at least one of the sisters as an employee of MAC Marketing Solutions - the firm selling the condo. Confronted by media, MAC president Cameron McNeill admitted both women were employees and apologized for misleading the public. This week, Mr. McNeill said he accepted the resignation of a senior manager.
While the stunt was roundly slammed, it also reignited a debate among real-estate observers: Just how much truth is in the long-standing narrative that foreign money is driving the local market? Anecdotes abound about foreign investors scooping up Metro Vancouver real estate, driving up prices and creating anxiety among locals - a bogeyman haunting the dream of home ownership - but evidence to support such a claim is scant.
Further, do foreign buyers really just invest and leave condos empty - or become new members of the community?
In Canada, realtors do not tally foreign investment in residential real estate.
However, the limited data compiled by research firms suggests the impact is negligible.
"The mythology is that there are hordes of investors coming in Vancouver and driving up prices," said Cameron Muir, chief economist at the British Columbia Real Estate Association. "The only data that we have available suggests that there's anywhere from 1 to 4 per cent of sales across Metro Vancouver that are foreign investors - from all sources. A couple of per cent, in terms of exposure to foreign investment, is not going to drive any investment."
In 2012, the City of Vancouver created an academic working group, under the Mayor's Task Force on Housing Affordability, to determine whether there was any validity to what Councillor Raymond Louie, council liaison for the task force, calls "a persistent theme that has been advanced by some."
The group's final report ultimately concluded it would require considerably more resources for a comprehensive study on the impact of foreign investment, but did yield some interesting findings.
In one case study, for example, Andrew Yan of Bing Thom Architects looked at the amount of energy consumption in a sample of downtown Vancouver condos. Working on the assumption that a condo is empty if it uses less electricity each month than it takes to power a refrigerator (75 kilowatt-hours), the urban planner and researcher concluded 5.5 per cent of the sample is empty at any given month.
However, even the slightest tweaks led to significantly different results: Raising the threshold to 100 kwh, for example, meant the percentage of potentially empty condos rose to 8.5 per cent; 150 kwh to 17 per cent.
In its final submission, the working group noted cross-referencing information sets from BC Hydro, BC Assessment, provincial home-owner grants and census data would paint a clearer picture, but it would be a costly endeavour, likely requiring the partnership of multiple levels of government. Mr. Louie said it is simply not feasible for the city to commit considerable time and money to a study whose results may not prove meaningful.
Meanwhile, 2012 figures from Landcor Data Corporation show that only 0.2 per cent of people who bought residential properties in Metro Vancouver last year are currently living outside of the country.
Alan Mah has worked as a realtor in Vancouver for nearly 30 years and says a very small percentage of his clients are from out of country. Of those, most are looking to secure better lives for their children by moving to Metro Vancouver - a marked difference from merely purchasing investment properties.
"Most people from China, for example, are coming here for their kids' educations," he said.
Such is the case with James Liang, who moved to Vancouver from Shenzhen, China, with his family two years ago wanting stability, a better environment and a more rounded education for their two daughters.
"We want our kids to know society more," said Mr. Liang, who hopes the girls will grow up and remain in Canada. "In China, the education, especially for high-school students, is mostly focused on [academics] like math, physics, chemistry. We want our kids to have a lot of other activities, like playing piano, joining the band, swimming, [first aid courses]."
With financial assistance from Mr. Liang's in-laws, the family moved into a small Vancouver Special in the Dunbar area. That neighbourhood, along with areas including Shaughnessy and parts of Richmond, are among those most favoured by foreign buyers, realtors say.
Jeff Fitzpatrick, a realtor with Sotheby's International Realty Canada, said influxes to certain pockets of a city can have a cascade effect. If offshore buyers scoop up the real estate in Point Grey, for example, a young professional in Vancouver who might have purchased there years ago might instead move to Main or Fraser streets. As a result, those markets are then priced up.
"Now the janitor who was hoping to buy a house along Main Street is now buying in Burnaby," he said.
However, Mr. Fitzpatrick also notes the difference between investors and new residents: "The people that are buying this stuff are [often] residing there; they're making an investment in the neighbourhood as well," he said.
"They're going to be buying milk, and buying gas and buying a car. They're not just going to be renting these [properties] out. So does that technically qualify as a domestic purchase or a foreign purchase? It muddies the water a bit."
The working group's final report also asked whether a non-resident (including foreign) investor would have a different impact from a B.C. resident investor.
"We really need to have a dialogue on this topic, because it has become a lightning rod to a lot of other issues in this city," Mr. Yan said. "We need more than urban myths and random anecdotes. The issue of foreign ownership has created an ambience of insecurity and fear, as opposed to hope and promise - which is a more constructive way of building cities."
As of February, residential property sales in Metro Vancouver remain slow. Last month's sales were the second-lowest January total in the region since 2001 - 18.7 per cent below the 10-year sales average for the month, according to the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver.
Sales of detached, attached and apartment properties were down 22.7 per cent in 2012 from the year before.

Abstract: Design aside, the sale of over 150 out of 420 suites in the past few months is also fuelled by the infill project's locale at 101 Erskine Ave., nearby established restaurants, boutiques and cinemas on Yonge Street, as well as a 24-hour supermarket and [Eglinton] subway station.

To satisfy the market's appetite for condominiums in the Yonge-Eglinton area, Tridel's fourth and latest development in the community will incorporate many key ingredients that made its previous projects popular.
First off, the 32-storey tower will offer spacious homes, including three-bedroom townhouses and two-bedroom suites with enclosed dens that could double as a third bedroom.
"We have sizes that fit all budgets, but we usually have great success with our Signature Collection product that ranges from 1,180 to 2,100 square feet higher up in the building," said Jim Ritchie, senior vice-president of sales and marketing at Tridel.
"We really targeted the local community in the Yonge and Eglinton area who are in rental accommodations - because there is quite a bit of it - and we also targeted end-users that may have bought condominiums on the smaller side and want to move up in size."
Even outdoors, various plans will feature extra-wide balconies or wrap-around terraces with over 500 square feet.
"It helps someone transition out of a house that isn't quite ready to give up a traditional backyard," says Mr. Ritchie. "We can't compete with a backyard, but we can give outdoor space where you have seating and can put out plantings."
The glass railings and expansive windows will add to the façade's sleek, modern overtones designed by CS & P Architects Inc., which designed Tridel's two-tower complex, The Republic, and revamped North Toronto Collegiate one street south, literally around the corner from the architectural firm's office.
"They really understand that Yonge and Eglinton environment," Mr. Ritchie states. "We borrowed some design cues from The Republic, which has been so well received from an architectural perspective, so you will see some similarities, though this building clearly has its own personality."
Design aside, the sale of over 150 out of 420 suites in the past few months is also fuelled by the infill project's locale at 101 Erskine Ave., nearby established restaurants, boutiques and cinemas on Yonge Street, as well as a 24-hour supermarket and Eglinton subway station. "Erskine is a quiet residential street, but in a very short walk you can be at the corner of Yonge and Eglinton," says Mr. Ritchie. "It really has been a destination neighbourhood."
The high-rise will have its own set of attractions, including a gym, yoga studio, theatre, billiards lounge and party room with a bar, dining space, kitchen and terrace with barbecue and dining areas.
A rooftop terrace on the sixth floor will provide an infinity pool and fireside lounge area.
For more intimate entertaining, private suites will have open-concept principal rooms with nine-foot ceilings, laminate and porcelain tile floors, as well as contemporary kitchen cabinetry, stainless steel appliances, and granite or quartz counters.
Penthouses will feature more lavish appointments, such as 10-foot ceilings, engineered wood floors, marble, granite and quartz finishes, plus extended upper kitchen cabinetry and upgraded appliances.
At a later date, 10 four-storey townhouses will be released south of the tower with 2,282 to 2,422 square foot plans, 12-foot ceilings and gas fireplaces on the first floor, patios and rooftop decks.
In addition, each unit will incorporate energy-efficient and eco-friendly components as required to be certified as a LEED building by the Canada Green Building Council.
Monthly fees will vary as Signature suites include parking.
Move in dates are projected for summer of 2015.

The forces guiding real estate are always local, but in the choppy Toronto market of 2013, the talk has turned to "hyper-local" strategies.
The various layers and pockets of the market are behaving so differently that buyers and sellers need to shift quickly - even as the Big Bank economists see the overall market wafting to a soft landing. Nationally, real estate prices have declined for five consecutive months, the Teranet-National Bank house price index shows.
Vancouver has had the greatest pull but Toronto is also one of the markets dragging down the overall index.
But if you're a seller in Toronto, the market looks very different depending on whether you're selling a gleaming condo suite for $899,000 or a slightly tired bungalow for $549,000.
To Ricky Chadha, a real estate agent with Royal Lepage Estate Realty, hyper-local in the condo market means he takes an inventory of what's for sale down the hall - or in the building next door. He doesn't need to look farther. If plenty of units are up for sale in the same condominium building, he may advise the seller to wait a week or two to see if there's less competition. But he doesn't recommend that they wait any longer because trying to predict the direction of the market is too challenging.
"I always tell people to move when it's the right time for them to move - not to try to play the market," Mr. Chadha said.
He says bidding wars are common for houses in that coveted $500,000 to $600,000 range that attracts move-up and first-time buyers. Buyers are willing to compete for houses in that range if they are close to transit, reasonably move-in ready and in an appealing neighbourhood, Mr. Chadha said.
He contrasts that with the spring of 2012 when buyers were scrapping even over rundown properties near the train tracks.
"Last year almost everything was going in multiples because people were just so frustrated at losing on so many bids."
Unless they have a prime property, Mr. Chadha is not advising sellers to hold off on looking at offers.
"That's a risky game to play these days."
He recently sold a house in Pickering without an offer date because that's an area where buyers have more to choose from than they do downtown. So he was pleasantly surprised when two buyers tabled bids a couple of days after the house arrived on the market with an asking price of $409,900. It sold for $417,000.
"We made short work of it. It was sold in two days, firm."
Mr. Chadha said condos have been selling more quickly recently in the segment below $400,000 but have remained sluggish at the higher end - especially those considered luxury units. The buyers are still looking, he said, but they often have more time to make a decision because they're less likely to have their timing dictated by the school calendar and factors like that.
"I think the condo buyers are seeking out more deals."
Christopher Bibby, an agent with Sutton Group-Associates Realty Inc., said he had a flurry of condo deals in January after a very slow fall market. Of seven condo listings he sold in January, five of those were holdovers from 2012, he said.
He sold, for example, a singular unit in the Button Factory Lofts that had been listed since last September with an asking price of $1.495-million. The property sat through the fall but in January showings suddenly picked up and the seller signed off on a deal at slightly less than the asking price.
Through the last quarter of 2012, buyers seemed timid and sellers were stubborn, says Mr. Bibby.
He believes that both groups have fresh mindsets for 2013: The stand-off has given way to a more active market where buyers are willing to step up with offers and sellers are willing to negotiate. He estimates that prices have come down between five and 10 per cent from the fall but adds that they seem stable at the moment.
"The sellers' expectations are a lot more reasonable. Negotiations are taking a lot longer," he says. "But It's healthy. It's fine. I'm supportive of the process."
As for where the market goes from here - especially for condos - Mr. Bibby says it's going to be interesting to see what happens. The carpenters and plumbers are finishing up new units every day.
"A lot of really good inventory is going to come onto the market," said Mr. Bibby of some of the new marquee addresses. But he acknowledges that the increase in supply could provide buyers with a lot to choose from. Still, he thinks plenty of buyers will be attracted to the gleaming new kitchens and bathrooms.
At Capital Economics, economist David Madani is standing by his view that real estate prices in Canada will decline by 25 per cent over the long term.
The declines so far will probably continue this year, he said, even without an obvious trigger for a correction. He said those insisting a trigger is necessary need look no further than the Vancouver market where prices have already fallen by more than five per cent from a year ago even as interest rates have remained unusually low and the jobless rate has not increased.

Full text:   The Teranet-National Bank index of Canadian housing prices continues to show the effects of a cooling trend that has hovered over the real estate market for more than a year. The index was at 153 last month, up just 2.7 per cent from January, 2012 - the lowest 12-month growth rate since November, 2009. It was also the 14th consecutive month of shrinking year-over-year price increases and the fifth consecutive month-to-month decline. Vancouver was the only city on the index to show a year-over-year decline, dropping 2.5 per cent compared with January, 2012. Seven of 11 local markets tracked by the Teranet land registry system showed month-to-month declines: Calgary, Edmonton, Hamilton, Montreal, Toronto, Vancouver, and Winnipeg.

Full text:   Chef David Lee shares more than just tantalizing dishes - he imparts his wisdom to the next generation of cooks
It is said that too many cooks in the kitchen spoil the broth.
But when that kitchen belongs to chef David Lee, the more the merrier.
Lee, the co-owner of the Nota Bene restaurant in Toronto with partners Yannick Bigourdan and Franco Prevedello, is as much a connoisseur of raw talent as he is of exquisitely prepared food, having personally nurtured several baker's dozens of apprentices who have gone on to achieve culinary success of their own.
"It's what you do with what you know that let's you be successful," says Lee, a firm believer in sharing wisdom in addition to recipes accumulated over a lifetime of culinary experience.
One of three panelists selected by The Globe and Mail to judge The Catalysts contest, the British-born chef of Chinese descent is known for deftly handling not only a white truffle, among other rarefied ingredients often used in his cooking, but also the people in his employ.
"It really comes down to love," says Anthony Rose, a former Lee apprentice who has gone on to be chef and co-owner of Rose and Sons, which opened at the intersection of Dupont and Davenport streets in Toronto nearly three months ago.
"He absolutely loves what he does and he's very gentle and soft-spoken and very nurturing. He's like a father figure, warm to be around. He makes you want to learn. He has influenced me greatly. Even now, when I'm trying to come up with a recipe or when cooking, I always ask myself, 'What would David Lee do?'"
Nurturing other chefs and helping them run restaurants of their own, as he did in 2009 after he sold his fine-dining restaurant Splendido to two members of his kitchen staff, is as much a Lee specialty as his Yucatan hot and sour soup.
"If I can give some of my beliefs, some of my philosophy, to an apprentice who wants it, emphasis on want , then I am happy," says Lee, sipping a morning coffee at one of the tables inside Nota Bene, the Queen Street West establishment where he mans a team of 25 chefs.
Trained in Michelin-starred cooking in Europe before immigrating to Canada in 1991, at 24, to take up a position as chef de cuisine under chef Marc Thuet at Centro in Toronto, Lee says that food is not just sustenance but an attitude.
Born in the village of Stevenage in Hertfordshire, England, about 50 kilometres north of London, the third generation of chefs in the Lee family moved with his elders to the island nation of Mauritius, once home to the now-extinct Dodo bird, when he was 6.
There, a doting grandmother taught him that cooking was about showing respect to the ingredients used in a particular dish as well as to the people assembled to prepare and eat it.
"I remember my grandmother teaching me respect at 6 even though I didn't really understand it until I was 15, which is when I first knew I wanted to be a chef," says the 42-year-old married father of two whose wife, Jennifer O'Brien, is a former chef turned real estate agent.
"She'd say to me, 'Okay, now we're going to see the chickens,' and she'd take me by the hand and she'd show me how to kill the chickens. I wasn't grossed out. For me, we had had this chicken since it was an egg, and then it was a baby chicken, and we fed it and it roamed around. We had to have dinner. If it was Chinese New Year a chicken had to be killed. It was a very natural thing."
More than three decades later, Lee continues to honour the animals who give their lives so humans can eat.
"Every morning here at Nota Bene we get tuna from Hawaii, and I feel and speak to the tuna and say, 'Thank you, there will be a lot of diners who'll be appreciating you tonight.'"
The apprentices he has trained have tended to adopt this animist approach to cooking.
Among them is Josh Wolfe, who served under Lee when both were at Centro.
"He taught me everything and I mean everything everything," Wolfe says from Vancouver, where he operates food truck Fresh Local Wild and soon will open his second bricks-and-mortar restaurant, each of which was inspired by what Lee taught him over a four-year period.
"He was my first real chef, the first to take me under his wing, and when he thought I was worthy of it, he taught me everything he knew."
That education involved Lee taking his apprentice back with him to England to revisit his culinary roots.
"I stayed with his mother," Wolfe continues, "and he took me to all the restaurants whose kitchens were influential to him. I think he was hoping I'd pick up and carry on what he wanted to teach me as a chef, which is a philosophy of cooking rooted in the love of the ingredient."
Lee is aware of the impact he has had on the young chefs he has raised through the ranks. He mentions one who once asked to go to Nepal for an extended leave of almost two months. "I said he could go on one condition," Lee says, leaning back. "And that was to bring me back something blessed by the monks."
That gift ended up being a large ball bracelet, which Lee wears on his right wrist, a constant reminder of the connections he has forged between those entrusted to his care and the universe at large. "Every apprentice wants to be a chef," he says. "But not every apprentice understands what it is I am preaching. Some might say I nag. But really I am giving knowledge, and an approach to life."

Full text:   A Vancouver real estate marketing company is apologizing for having two employees pose as prospective home buyers in televised newscasts on a supposed spike in sales around the Lunar New Year.
The two young women - presented as house-hunting sisters whose parents would be in town from China for the New Year to help them purchase a condo - are in fact an administrative assistant and a sales assistant with MAC Marketing Solutions, president Cameron McNeill confirmed to The Globe and Mail.
"All I can say is that I deeply apologize for having misled the media for being there," said Mr. McNeill, who said he was out of town over the Family Day long weekend, when the news segments aired. "We were busy and I don't know if the girls were put up to it, or just put on the spot, or if it happened spontaneously. Regardless, it was wrong and I take full responsibility, on my own shoulders."
The news segments were on the supposed spike in sales activity in the weeks around Lunar New Year - a pattern Mr. McNeill insists is "100 per cent true." In one news segment, the women tour a suite in downtown Vancouver's Maddox condo development - which is being marketed by MAC. One woman tells the camera they cannot afford to buy on their own and must rely on assistance from their parents.
"We definitely like it here, but we have to talk to our parents," she says. "Maybe tomorrow we will bring them here. ... If we like this place, we have to tell them and they make the decision. Usually, Chinese people like to buy during this time."
In reality, the women are not even related.
The misrepresentation was first spotted by the local online community and then dissected on local blogs and message boards. Some noticed a Google search of one of the women's names turned up her Facebook and LinkedIn pages - both since deleted - which stated she worked at MAC.
Mr. McNeill said there have been discussions about the incident within the company, but it is not yet known who is behind it. When asked if the ploy may lead to terminations at the company, he said it would depend on the depth of responsibility.
"If it was blatant and on the hands of one person, then I think there might be some severe repercussions, but it's hard for me to answer that without knowing all the details surrounding it," he said.
This is the latest in a number of questionable marketing tactics to be exposed within Metro Vancouver's real estate community. During a media blitz announcing the Groupon-style sale of units at a Surrey condo development last year, one woman identified to a television news crew as an eager local investor was in fact a sales manager for Key Marketing, the company behind the scheme.
That same company has also taken groups of Chinese buyers on helicopter tours of Metro Vancouver properties, and at least one of those trips was believed to be misleading. Garth Turner, a business journalist and former politician, reported the Chinese buyers on a Feburary, 2011, trip - on which several media outlets were invited - were in fact local real estate agents and brokers and the trip was meant to promote a new condo development.
Cam Good, president of The Key, which includes Key Marketing, was a partner at MAC Marketing Solutions from 2004 to 2009, according to his LinkedIn page.
According to 2011 data by the Landcor Data Corporation, 75 per cent of those who purchased Metro Vancouver condos as investment properties are from Metro Vancouver. About 3 per cent are from the U.S. and 2 per cent are from other countries.

A splash of colour in a sea of grey

Abstract: This might be exciting. After all, the late-Victorian architects of luxury housing - such as the [Charles H. Gooderham] mansion and other large family homes round about - appreciated and freely deployed vibrant, rich reds, oranges, yellows. Should the terra cotta cladding of Mr. [Thomas Kerwin]'s tall structure do nothing more than reproduce the reddish-orange of the villa's brick, it will give a lift to an area where former grace has given way to many grey, tiresome concrete piles and slabs.

Full text:   jmays@globeandmail.com
Despite the recent flourishing of ways to pigment glass and other cladding products, the skins of most residential towers going up in Toronto these days are colourless, or their hues are diluted or muted. The result is urban fabric that's always sagging visually toward dull neutrality, that blah state of affairs between really dense darkness (which can be effective, as it is in Ludwig Mies van der Rohe's Toronto-Dominion Centre) and bright chromatic display.
One sometimes hears reasons why greyness prevails. I have been told by both developers and tall-building architects, for example, that home-buyers don't want to dwell in colourful structures. Be that as it may, prospective homeowners are certainly getting very few chances to find out what living with colour would mean, since the people who design and put up residential buildings seem reluctant to let them try it.
Most designers and most developers, that is. But not all.
Because I would like to see innovative applications of colour in contemporary architecture, I perked up when I saw the first rendering of a distinctly red 52-storey condominium tower proposed for a Sherbourne Street site just south of Bloor Street East. This condo stack may not, in the end, inject colour that's very strong into its stretch of Sherbourne; the work is still at an early stage, and the exact appearance of its skin is not settled. But the rendering is a sign that at least one North American architect and his clients are thinking about giving colour a prominent role in shaping our perception of the modern city.
The designer, in this instance, is Thomas Kerwin, principal in the Chicago firm of bkL Architecture LLC. His bosses on this job include well-known Toronto real-estate companies: Diamondcorp, headed by Stephen Diamond; Fernbrook Homes; and Cityzen Development Group.
The place on which their attention is focused is a piece of local history. The boxy Gothic mansion standing there today - and destined to be spared in Mr. Kerwin's scheme - was built for distiller Charles H. Gooderham in 1882, when Sherbourne was still a very fashionable address. The street slid rapidly downhill thereafter, and, by the First World War, the Gooderham house was a residential hotel.
It might then have slipped out of our urban memory altogether - along with other once-grand Sherbourne Street residences, several demolished long ago - had not Ernest Hemingway lived there during his stint in the 1920s at the Toronto Star. The house is famous because Hemingway was. After the building's upcoming transformation from hotel into retail space - such is the intention of the developers - something should remain on board to commemorate Hemingway's Hogtown stay long ago.
Plans for the site involve the tear-down of the homely hotel annex behind the house, and the resituation of the house itself closer to the sidewalk. A similar move was made next door, where a developer pushed another Victorian mansion up against the street and dropped a tower behind it.
Carving out territory to raise new condo stacks without ripping out historic edifices makes such moving about of old buildings inevitable, I suppose - but it can never be quite desirable. Those gracious, expansive city homes were designed to be seen in a certain manner - across broad front gardens, with luxurious grounds on either side.
I'm glad, of course, that Diamondcorp and Cityzen decided (or were persuaded) to save the architectural stuff of the Gooderham villa itself. But landscaping is architecture, too, and once the house is moved, we will never again be able to visualize the harmonies between mansion and grounds, and between the total ensemble of the streetscape and city, that the Victorian architect carefully created on this ample urban lot.
Something will be lost, that is.
But, if the finished tower closely resembles the renderings, a tattered, coarse patch of Toronto's fabric could gain a fresh, badly needed jolt of visual voltage. As Mr. Kerwin explained the project, the wide oblong windows of the grid-like façade will be framed, top to bottom, by plain terra cotta panels hung on the building's skeleton. The intensity and shade of terra cotta, the architect said, will correspond to the colours of the old brickwork in the neighbourhood.
This might be exciting. After all, the late-Victorian architects of luxury housing - such as the Gooderham mansion and other large family homes round about - appreciated and freely deployed vibrant, rich reds, oranges, yellows. Should the terra cotta cladding of Mr. Kerwin's tall structure do nothing more than reproduce the reddish-orange of the villa's brick, it will give a lift to an area where former grace has given way to many grey, tiresome concrete piles and slabs. I hope Mr. Kerwin and his clients are bold in their final choice of colour, since anything less will mean a fine opportunity to vivify the city has been skipped.

Full text:   Luxury retailers' first storefront pays homage to a bygone era. WANT Apothecary's retail prescription works, but hinges on location
In the fashion capital of Canada, trendy clothing boutiques come in all shapes and sizes. But in Montreal, only one comes disguised as a drugstore: Retail therapy gone literal.
Designed to resemble, in part, an old-fashioned drugstore, WANT Apothecary is a luxury fashion and accessories boutique located at 4960 Sherbrooke Street West in upscale Westmount, a gentrified neighbourhood of restaurants, florists and hardware stores next door to English-language libraries left over from the days when the area ruled as a WASP bastion.
"The idea was to create something that looked like it had always been here, like it belonged to the neighbourhood," explains Dexter Peart, 40, co-owner with his identical twin of WANT Les Essentiels de la Vie, a line of made-in-Canada leather accessories whose streamlined elegance is internationally renowned.
"We wanted to create a lifestyle shop," interjects Byron, distinguishable from his brother by his lack of glasses.
"A place," says Dexter finishing the other's sentence, "that feels easy to walk into."
The inspiration behind the concept store was a vintage apothecary Dexter visited in Niagara-on-the Lake while on vacation. He instantly fell in love with the nostalgia-tinged ambience.
When it came to designing his own store, he made sure to recreate the original mortar and pestle motif he first spied in Ontario.
WANT Apothecary is the first bricks-and-mortar extension of WANT Agency Inc., the six-year-old fashion distribution business that the Ottawa natives operate out of renovated offices in Montreal's Chabanel garment district, together with business partners (and married couple) Mark Wiltzer and Jacqueline Gelber.
The 1,000-square-foot, newly renovated storefront sells only those luxury fashion brands represented by WANT Agency, including German hosiery from century-old firm Falke and Sweden's Nudie jeans, a Justin Bieber favourite.
Previously a children's clothing boutique, the storefront was completely gutted, right down to the brick. Maria Rosa di Ioia executed the interior design, using Bianco Carrara marble, American walnut and brushed copper to make the space look traditional.
From the deliberately distressed wooden floors laid out in an old-world herring-bone pattern to the traditional cast-iron Victorian fireplace at the back of the store , the space feels homey and lived-in.
What was formerly a back office was opened up to create an intimate interior decorated with flowers and mirrors. The large glass windows overlooking the street draw in passersby.
Between $300 and $500 a square foot was spent in transforming the space, an investment Mr. Wiltzer says was worth it.
"The environment created is extremely important and relevant to positioning and merchandising of their products to their customers," he says.
Designing the store, as well as choosing its location, was carefully considered as part of a retail plan intended to give WANT, and related businesses operating under that title, a heightened cachet.
The partners opted for a residential neighbourhood over a busy commercial street like Ste-Catherine Street West, where retail rents have risen by an average of 12.5 per cent as a result of recent infrastructure improvements, according to Cushman & Wakefield's Main Streets Across the World 2012 report.
They wanted to appeal directly to customers on a personal level in creating what Byron Peart describes as "a retail environment where the staff might know you by name."
The plan now is to open similar concept stores in other cities in Canada; Toronto, Vancouver and Ottawa for starters.
The brothers are looking for locations similar to Montreal's, upscale neighbourhoods with the right mix of adjacencies - food shops, bakeries, coffee shops and other places people are drawn to for health and sustenance.
"In terms of size, 1,200 to 2,000 square feet is ideal," says Mr. Wiltzer, who, with his wife, is overseeing the launch of WANT's first retail website, scheduled to launch later this year. "But finding the right space takes time.
"Each city we visit, we walk around the different neighbourhoods, talking to local retailers, doing our best to get a feel for the area in order to determine if it's right for us. We go back twice, even three times.
"Once we decide we like an area, we focus on finding available locations that will be a good fit for a WANT Apothecary store. It's sometimes a tedious process."
Last spring, the brothers launched a retail space in collaboration with the hip French fashion and music label Maison Kitsuné within the new NoMad Hotel in New York, close to the Flatiron District.
In the fall, they opened WANT Passport at Toronto's Billy Bishop Airport, aimed at the style-savvy traveller.
Still, the idea, as conceived by the twins, remains the same: a retail space that is more than just goods. It's about feeling good - one personalized luxury purchase at a time.
"This is not a fast fashion," Dexter says. "That's why being in a neighbourhood is important. You are able to slow down the conversation, create a relationship with your customer.
"That's a lifestyle choice for us," he says.
"And," inserts his brother, "a responsibility."

POSITIONING
Two commercial real estate professionals assess WANT boutique's bricks-and-mortar strategy.
Bruce Munro
The vice-president of retail advisory services for Avison Young in Montreal grew up in Westmount. Personally and professionally, he knows that the upscale neighbourhood represents a niche market.
"That's a lot of money to spend on a small boutique and particularly in that location where there isn't a lot of foot traffic," he says. " A boutique like WANT Apothecary doesn't belong on Ste-Catherine Street. They're not a mid-price-point retailer, which traditionally is what is found on Ste-Catherine.
"So the decision to open where they opened is not a wrong decision. It's an affluent part of town where the people can afford what they're offering. Not to mention that the rents on Ste-Catherine would be three to four times what they are paying on Sherbrooke Street West."
John Crombie
Cushman & Wakefield's senior managing director of national retail services says the boutique chose its location well.
"For any retailer, one of the most important factors in choosing a location is understanding the customer you want to attract and appeal to and who is also able to afford your products," he says.
"...WANT is positioning itself to be a unique, high-end quality products/fashion merchandiser, located in high-income neighbourhoods that customers want to discover by chance. Being unique and off-the-beaten track is definitely their appeal.
"I see WANT best suited in high-street locations in Toronto, like areas like Yonge and Lawrence, Yorkville or Forest Hill Village, as opposed to high-end luxury malls or on Bloor Street," Mr. Crombie adds.
"I believe there is a market for WANT throughout Canada, but the location would be critical."

Full text:   The Hollywood-friendly religion's secrets have been exposed by South Park, the movie The Master and a recent bestseller. But none may be more damaging than a new memoir by the niece of its charismatic leader, who charges it has mistreated children - including herself. Can the Church 'audit' its own troubles away? John Allemang reports
To the Church of Scientology, Jenna Miscavige Hill is an apostate - a discredited troublemaker bent on destroying the faith in which she was born and raised.
The soft-spoken 29-year-old mother of two doesn't come across as a heretic worthy of Inquisition-era damnation.
But with Beyond Belief , her just-published coming-of-age memoir, she has challenged a church that despises criticism by making allegations about Scientology's mistreatment of its youngest adherents. What makes her defiance even more provocative is that her uncle, David Miscavige, is the all-powerful leader of the highly secretive institution.
Ms. Miscavige Hill says Scientology makes it hard for devotees to leave the faith, and most who do depart go quietly, since the church threatens its dissidents with severe reprisals. For an insider to speak out is rare, but her testimony is rarer still: Groomed for leadership from earliest childhood, she says she has direct experience of the church's indoctrination process and can speak with personal authority about an upbringing in which child labour, family separation, arbitrary punishment and psychological bullying were sanctioned by the church.
"I want to turn this horrible part of my life into something that has a good purpose," she says. "I hope to discourage new people from being lured into Scientology, as well as helping people whose loved ones are in there. And maybe I can get to people who are inside, and plant a seed of doubt."
Ms. Miscavige Hill's story suggests that the open society we inhabit still includes enclaves where authoritarian religious values are forced on innocent children. It is hard to look away when she describes the day-to-day torments she says she suffered in a church whose beliefs and behaviours are weird even by the standards of offbeat new religions.
But then everything about Scientology is peculiarly fascinating to the rest of us: the intense cultivation of Hollywood celebrity culture, the "space opera" theology of past lives and roaming aliens created by founder L. Ron Hubbard and the extreme enthusiasm of the church's followers, who spend small fortunes on training courses that lead them through the mysteries of the faith. Ms. Miscavige Hill describes it all as "brainwashing," a cultish term that can't help but pique the sensation-seeking prurience of outsiders.
Like all new religions that face opposition, Scientology is keen to trumpet its successes and the church has embarked on a global expansion plan that includes the building of dozens of state-of-the-religious-art facilities - including a new church in Cambridge, Ont., that is being opened on Saturday, and a luxurious advanced-training resort nestled along the Niagara Escarpment northwest of Toronto. But the church's trademark optimism can't fend off a dissonant chorus of complaint that the institution has lost its way.
The mounting criticism includes Lawrence Wright's new book Going Clear , which focuses on Mr. Miscavige's courting of celebrities such as Tom Cruise and Canadian filmmaker Paul Haggis; a recent Vanity Fair article on the church's efforts to arrange a marriage for Mr. Cruise; a film, The Master , which describes the dodgy origins of a post-war therapeutic cult called The Cause; a South Park episode that casually revealed Scientology's most closely guarded secrets about the creation of wandering spirits known as thetans; and calculated cyberattacks by the Anonymous group of hacktivists.
The anti-Scientology campaign claimed a victory in Canada last April - and added to the skepticism about the future of the organization - when a church-affiliated Narconon drug-rehabilitation centre in Trois-Riviere was shut down by provincial health-care officials.
A one-billion-year contract
Scientologists are trained to ignore all this critical noise . For powerful Scientologists such as Mr. Cruise, the church's rigorous teachings have undoubtedly helped them overcome doubts and find a discipline that is laser-like in its fixation on a goal.
"They sincerely believe that their lives gain purpose and meaning, and that they have superior insight into the world," says Lorne Dawson, professor of sociology at the University of Waterloo.
Mr. Miscavige has made it a priority to cultivate the church's big names, maximizing their P.R. potential and flattering them with deluxe celebrity centres and special honours of recognition - Mr. Cruise was awarded Scientology's newly created Freedom Medal of Valor in 2004.
But there's little Mr. Miscavige can do to counteract the memoir by his own niece, because it's such a seemingly matter-of-fact retelling of the indoctrination process that gives the church control over its members.
Ms. Miscavige Hill says her early childhood was spent at a remote camp in the California desert, where the third-generation Scientologist was put to 14-hour days on manual labour and the church's technical training without getting even a rudimentary academic education. She says she saw her parents, who lived at Scientology headquarters 30 kilometres away, once a week at best.
By the age of 7, Ms. Miscavige Hill says she held the job of camp medical liaison officer, responsible for tending the health of her fellow trainees. Her Miscavige name accelerated her advancement: The same year she was inducted into the Scientology's executive-leadership stream, known as the Sea Organization, and told to sign a billion-year contract with the church.
"It's disgusting," she now says. "It's completely taking advantage of someone who's innocent, vulnerable and has no one there to protect them - who really has no idea what they're signing."
But for anyone living in the Scientology environment, where excommunicants claim the outside world is depicted as ignorant and threatening, imposing a billion-year contract was perfectly suited to the church's values.
" We believed that we were spirits called thetans who'd lived lifetime after lifetime and been around billions of years," says Ms. Miscavige Hill. "So even though your body was young, you're basically an adult."
Scientology's future leaders, she says, were expected to reveal everything about themselves in sessions with superiors and willingly inform on their colleagues' slightest deviation from the religion's norms. Early training involved practicing how to stare at a policy statement by L. Ron Hubbard for an hour or enduring two hours of being belittled in a toughening-up exercise of humiliation called Training Routine Bullbait.
Scientology, which began as a self-help movement in the 1950s, teaches its followers to disconnect their mind from their feelings, to react logically rather than emotionally. The aim is to gain control, of self and others, and to block out negative thoughts - Ms. Miscavige Hill's grandfather, an early convert, credited Hubbard's teachings about unlimited human potential with making him a top salesman.
But the "crazy, closed world" Jenna Miscavige Hill says she inhabited as she did the laundry for church executives and made beds for visiting Scientologists in church-run hotels was one of restriction, suspicion and mistrust.
Submission to authority was prized. Outbreaks of individuality were treated as ethical violations and individual desires as disruptive signs of selfishness. Questioning and curiosity were regarded as defiant and dangerous. Those who resisted authority and conformity risked being declared a Suppressive Person - an extreme form of demonization that could require other Scientologists, family members included, to cut them out of their lives.
Outsiders, labelled wogs in church parlance, were increasingly finding fault with these manifestations of Scientology as the Internet expanded, but word of their criticisms never penetrated into the Sea Org. universe.
"Within the church, you're not allowed to have cellphones, the only access to the Internet is in a locked room, and there's special software that blocks anti-Scientology websites," Ms. Miscavige Hill says. "So if you have a bad experience, you think you're the only one who feels that way, you think you must be crazy."
Because of her relationship with the head of the church, she says, she was sometimes spoiled and pampered, such was the fear of offending her uncle. But as she matured into a friendly, too enthusiastic teenager, she was more closely monitored, making it easier for an unbearable deviation like flirting with male co-workers to be spotted and corrected through demotion and hard labour - her punishments included scrubbing mouldy bathroom grout with a toothbrush.
When her parents, fed up with being mistreated themselves, finally decided to quit the church, their daughter says, she became suspect as well and her loyalty was tested even more. At 18, she was caught having sex with her fiancé in violation of church laws, and was forced to describe every detail of the experience. Such intrusive confessionals are an essential element in the church's practices, she says, and any admissions of wrongdoing or shameful behaviour are weapons that can later be used against would-be critics.
Eventually, she too, decided she had to leave, and faced the breakup of her marriage when church officials told her husband he would be disconnected from his family of big-donor Scientologists if he joined her. She says she was also told to swear that she would never speak out against the church - each violation would cost her $10,000.
Building churches, and support
When the church inaugurates its so-called Ideal Org. (i.e. church) in Cambridge, Ont., on Saturday, a building meant to display all that is best about David Miscavige's visionary leadership, protesters will assemble to dampen the festive spirit.
Negativity is in the air. Scientology's optimistic plans for an advanced training base northwest of Toronto - which a church publication says will include 50 rooms where members can rid themselves of past-life traumas by being hooked up to a machine called an e-meter and a fully equipped office reserved for the return of L. Ron Hubbard, who died in 1986 - also attracts online jeers and public protests from ex-Scientologists and their allies.
Former members of the church are skeptical of the need for these new centres and dozens like them that have been built around the world, even as they acknowledge the institutional logic of the growth strategy. "They're attempting to convince people that they're expanding simply by acquiring real estate," says Jefferson Hawkins, a one-time Scientology marketing expert. "They're showplaces, but they're largely empty because membership has been declining for many years."
Official Scientology membership numbers are hard to come by. The degree of commitment to Scientology can extend from a casual purchase of Mr. Hubbard's seminal book, Dianetics , or the filling out of an introductory Scientology questionaire ("Do you sleep well?"; "Do your past failures still worry you?"; "Are you often impulsive in your behaviour?") to the high-level courses that supply Mr. Hubbard's more esoteric revelations after years of study and the expenditure of several hundred thousand dollars.
Canadian Scientology leaders say there are about 100,000 members in the country, but the 2001 Census recorded only 1,525 Scientologists. Prof. Dawson estimates that there are 5,000 Canadian Scientologists, and 150,000 worldwide. Mr. Hawkins guesses that the global total is no more than 40,000 - countering claims by church officials that there are as many as eight million members.
If there is such a glaring discrepancy between low membership numbers and a grandiose expansion plan, attracting new followers to the glamorous new buildings would seem to be essential for Scientology. But some outsiders think the growth strategy could be just as much about boosting the enthusiasm and support of long-time members, particularly big donors such as Mr. Cruise, and Nancy Cartwright, the voice of Bart Simpson.
And so the unveiling of a new facility resembles a massive Scientology pep rally. At the recent opening of an Ideal Org. in Padua, Italy, thousands of devotees celebrated the renovation of a delapidated 18th-century Veneto villa, local politicians praised the church's anti-drug campaigns and disaster-relief efforts, and the boyish-looking Mr. Miscavige made a pledge "to bring our help and the infinite wisdom of L. Ron Hubbard's technology to this region."
Such highly visible displays of solidarity aim to drown out all the ambient negativity about the faith: "There's a P.R. value externally, but there's also a P.R. value internally," Mr. Hawkins says. "Because they can say, look how well David Miscavige is doing as our leader."
'There are some truths there'
But beyond the ambitious CEO's growth trajectory, there's also a deeper psychological element that holds Scientology's believers close to their faith. "You think your entire progress as a spiritual being is tied up with your progress in Scientology," Mr. Hawkins says. "You're going toward a state of immortality where you're an all-knowing being and can go from body to body, and that's a hell of a thing. If somebody says, 'You do what I say or I'll cut you off from any spiritual advancement,' you're going to tend to do what they say."
To outsiders, this kind of complete devotion may sound extreme and even self-destructive. "What we're missing is that an individual has undergone maybe a decade of what's called cognitive drift," Prof. Dawson says. "It's a process where you get drawn in and experience social reinforcement, you like the people and enjoy the activity, maybe you get psychological benefits, you feel more relaxed. Eventually, and only a small segment of people get to this stage, your mindset shifts."
But this is where Ms. Miscavige Hill draws the line: Scientology's growth strategy, she says, now depends on retaining the children of the most fervent Scientologists, people who are nurtured in the faith and accustomed to its ways.
"There are many people like myself who were born into it," she says. "They didn't have a choice and that's all the world is for them. They don't have anywhere else to go. ... We weren't given a good education, we weren't taught how to drive, we don't know how to use a bank account or how to cook, and that's a really big deal."
To address those feelings of isolation and anxiety, she helped establish the exscientologykids.com website with a mission that neatly matches the It Gets Better campaign for gay youth.
"It's a place where people in Scientology who are having trouble and don't think things are quite right can visit and know that there are people out there going through the same thing," she says. When Katie Holmes split from Tom Cruise and demanded custody of their daughter, she offered public encouragement. "I was just saying, good for you, get your daughter away from there, that's no place for children."
Yet for all that she is dedicated to changing the ways of Scientology, she is still a product of the system, and she hesitates when asked if it did her good as well as harm.
"There are some truths there," she says slowly. "Scientology started out as a self-help group, and there's one thing Scientologists love to say: Communication is a universal solvent. Some things L. Ron Hubbard said may be true. But you can find those same truths in much less controlling and abusive organizations."
And then she turns back to her own experience of Scientology, the lesson she's gleaned from the 21 years she spent in the faith. "It's one thing if you go there to get help as an adult. But if you start to experience Scientology as a child, it's hard to say it's helping you solve your problems when it's also creating all of your problems. The one thing Scientology helped me with is to get over my fear of crazy Scientology executives."

Full text:   While proud of its modernity, this grey-patinated zinc-clad house doesn't seem out of place in its Victorian brick neighbourhood
jmays@globeandmail.com
Last week, I was surprised to learn that the district west of the University of Toronto's St. George campus had acquired a name: Harbord Village. (I had always thought of it as "the student quarter," when I thought of it at all.)
Outside the imaginings of the residents' association - a vividly heritage-minded group, I gather - the area has never been a village. It was just a spot in the residential sprawl that swept westward from Spadina Avenue in late Victorian times, burying truck farms and livestock lots under new avenues and middle-class housing.
As a visit to any part of this zone suggests, the homebuilders active in this 19th-century surge drew on picturesque, high-style models for their mid-market productions - among other sources, the steeply vertical Gothic family house and the deluxe Second Empire cottage.
The result of this borrowing, as we have it today in Harbord Village, is street after attractive street of modest houses that translate upscale architectural lingo into a popular, marketable vernacular. It was a hit with consumers 120 years ago, and (after a long slump) it's a hit again today.
I heard the (to me) new name of the area when I dropped by a dwelling recently put up there according to plans by Michael Taylor, partner in the Toronto firm of Taylor_Smyth architects.
In crafting this house, Mr. Taylor, a member in good standing of our town's tribe of talented modernist designers, had to maintain a tactful balance between conflicting realities. On one hand, there was the desire of his clients, one of whom is a builder, for a thoroughly contemporary dwelling. (The builder in this couple considered going with Victorian revival styling, but then abandoned the idea.)
On the other hand, there were certain facts on the ground that had to be taken into account. These included local loyalty to the old streetscapes of the neighbourhood, as well as the insistence by the streetscapes themselves that they be taken seriously. They are strongly sculpted arrays of porches, bay windows, gables and intervals, in other words; not rows of bland or demure façades that could be easily ignored.
Mr. Taylor's solution, built out in his 3,000-square-foot, three-storey house, is not a compromise: The streetside face is a straightforwardly modern composition of undecorated, jauntily stacked boxes and crisply defined right angles. The materials used here for cladding are similarly up to date: burnt-black brick, dark zinc, and a ground-floor expanse, almost as wide as the house itself, of Trespa, a super-tough laminate that mimics (in this case) the appearance of warm wood, but that doesn't have wood's vulnerability to weather.
While unapologetic about its modernity, however, the house-front is notably polite to its elderly neighbours.
The natural hardness of the grey patinated zinc cladding, for example, has been aged by a blush of red, which makes the material seem, like the Victorian brick round about it, a bit weather-beaten.
The sheets of blond Trespa that cover the garage door and the main entrance, as well, aim to help the building nestle into its old blond-brick context - though here Mr. Taylor's bid to be considerate perhaps goes too far, insofar as it has left the house looking too "woodsy" for its situation in the heart of a big city.
But more effectively than the coloration of the exterior, Mr. Taylor's subtle carving of the façade picks up on features that lend charm and interest to the the streets of Harbord Village. There's a hint of a bay window, a conspicuous porch, a knowing allusion to a Gothic gable - none of it patronizing, all of it an acknowledgment that contemporary architectural styling still has a thing or two to learn from the pleasing formal rhythms put in play along our streets more than a century ago.
Though Mr. Taylor's fashioning of the exterior is the most interesting aspect of this project, I could hardly end this review of it without a glance at the fine open-plan interior. It is bright, expansive, and deftly, economically detailed. Light floods into the middle of the building from above and the living room area is lit by a tall, very wide glass wall that slides away in good weather, giving on to the small back garden.
My favourite place in this house, however, is at the very top. Currently home to a piano and not much else, this third-storey studio and its terrace could some day become an ideal urban refuge - an alluringly lonesome eyrie boosted above the streets.
It seems far from the city, yet it's very close.
It's a liminal space, that is, of the sort many city-dwellers like to retreat into occasionally - even those who love the avenues of friendly neighbourhoods such as the one now known as Harbord Village.

Full text:   Surrey and New Westminster, B.C., put taxpayer cash on the line to spur development in key areas
Jim Cox is very interested in turning a profit for his corporation. He's always on the lookout for new development opportunities and potential business partners. He's quietly assembling land for a future play.
"We're here to make money," says Mr. Cox, a trim, silver-haired man whose resumé includes his work on the massive redevelopment of Vancouver's waterfront land near Stanley Park in the 1990s.
But Mr. Cox, contrary to what this introduction might imply, is not a private-sector developer. He's the head of a development corporation created in 2007 by the City of Surrey, the fastest-growing and geographically largest municipality in the Vancouver region.
Under his direction, Surrey City Development Corp. has invested $13-million of taxpayer funds into a $100-million, 50-storey hotel, office and condo complex that will become a key feature of the new downtown the city is trying to create out of what was little more than a SkyTrain stop, a cluster of big-box stores and fast-food outlets, and a giant tower perched on top of a mall. The project, 3 Civic Centre, is due to break ground soon and is to be completed in early 2015.
The corporation also bought a failing mall in its Cloverdale neighbourhood, with plans to redevelop it into a mixed-use project. On industrial land near the river, it is constructing a building geared specifically to house a local brewery that is expanding and couldn't find the space it wanted in Surrey. It is developing an industrial park in another sector of the huge city. And it is co-developing a 114-unit townhouse project in south Surrey.
Mr. Cox and the Surrey corporation are one example of the aggressive strategies some suburban municipalities are taking as they look for ways to make money from the land they hold or to encourage private development.
Larger cities have ventured into that kind of entrepreneurial development for decades. Toronto has its own development corporation. Vancouver has an unusually active real-estate department. Over the years, it has built rental apartments, bought a giant empty department store in its troubled Downtown Eastside and co-developed it with a private partner, and assembled land in order to foster private-sector development.
But now suburban municipalities are contemplating or adopting a similar approach to take advantage of the land they have or to encourage development for particular goals.
In Surrey, part of Mr. Cox's work is specifically aimed at creating the conditions for developers to build in the planned new downtown.
Across the river, in the small city of New Westminster, the council is putting $95-million of its own money on the line by developing an office tower on top of a needed civic centre. The Anvil Centre, under construction and due to open in 2014, is meant to spur development around its downtown SkyTrain stop. But it's also undertaking the risky move to try to generate more activity in its historic but somewhat shabby downtown, with the centre and tower positioned as a gateway to the area.
Developers already building in those areas or those who are contemplating whether to start something tend to be enthusiastic about seeing cities commit their money.
"The investment New Westminster has made is a huge catalyst to development there," says Robert Fung, who specializes in restoring and upgrading historic buildings.
The city says three developers are in talks with the city about new projects since the tower decision was made, but those aren't public yet.
In Surrey, the company building the 50-storey tower also expresses admiration for the city's can-do approach. Sean Hodgins, president of Century Group, the company building the 50-storey tower, said Surrey's attitude has made developers feel confident.
That's not just because of its efforts to assemble land around the new downtown, which provides big blocks that are attractive to developers, or its small investment in the Century project.
It's also because Surrey has put some serious skin in the game by building a new city hall and new main library, which will be main features of the downtown-to-be.
Mr. Hodgins says, as do many municipal politicians and planners, that it's understandable that cities would become developers of industrial parks, townhouses, or hotels. "The local government often is one of the larger developers in a region anyway."
But the idea of a city expanding its reach beyond community centres, libraries or sewage-treatment plants also makes some people wary .
Michael Geller, a well-known development consultant in Vancouver, was on the Surrey corporation's board. He quit because he got uncomfortable about some of the deals the corporation was considering.
Mr. Geller said he has no problem with cities trying to capitalize on their land or even to build commercial projects that the private sector won't. "If it could be proven that they were a developer of last resort, that's okay."
But he doesn't support cities developing their land with the explicit goal of making money, as Mr. Cox has said Surrey's corporation has. "That's where we part ways. There's not only the appearance of a conflict of interest. There are going to be conflicts."
But Mr. Geller is also critical of the New Westminster decision to finance a new office tower, even though the only private-sector partner the city could find for it bailed before construction started. That would seem to make the project in need of a developer of last resort.
But the problem in that case, Mr. Geller said, is the city is plunging into an investment that every other private-sector developer in the city judged as too risky after the city said it wouldn't allow any condos - the easiest profit-making part of any mixed-use project.
Mr. Cox acknowledges that a city or city corporation has to be more cautious than a private developer. "There's no question there's risk associated. One of the things we're very careful of is how far and how deep our participation is."
With the brewery building, the city is leasing it to Central City Brewers at market rates, although it did have to get special financing security because of the risk that, if the brewery were to leave, the city would have a hard time finding another tenant.
He said the corporation is also careful not to price its products below what private developers are selling or leasing for, even though it has an advantage, to avoid accusations of unfairness or conflict. But Mr. Cox remains firmly convinced about the value of the city's entrepreneurial approach.
"Because we're in the market, we can help to achieve community objectives."

Abstract: Eugen Klein, president of the Greater Vancouver board, said many home sellers are choosing to delist their homes rather than settle for a lower bid. "When a home seller isn't receiving the kind of offers they want, there comes a point when they decide to either lower the price or remove the home from the market. Right now, it seems many home sellers are opting for the latter," Mr. Klein said in a statement.

Full text:   Amid a standoff between buyers and sellers, the number of homes sold in Greater Vancouver fell 14.3 per cent last month.
There were 1,351 property sales in the region in January, down from 1,577 in the same month of 2012, the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver said Monday. The year-over-year price index in January for single-family detached homes, townhouses and condos decreased 2.8 per cent to $588,100.
"We don't think it is a crash. We just think it is a mild correction that the real estate market is going through," Helmut Pastrick, the Vancouver-based chief economist at Central 1 Credit Union, said in an interview.
Mr. Pastrick forecasts that sales in Greater Vancouver and the Fraser Valley will be slightly down this year, compared with 2012, and that benchmark prices might slip roughly 3 per cent.
But as the provincial, national and international economies gradually strengthen, 2014 and 2015 will likely mark the return of better times in B.C. real estate, he said.
"The market will remain soft for a few more months, and then begin to stabilize," Mr. Pastrick said. "The improvement in economic conditions will generate gains in employment and income, and consumer confidence will pick up."
Eugen Klein, president of the Greater Vancouver board, said many home sellers are choosing to delist their homes rather than settle for a lower bid. "When a home seller isn't receiving the kind of offers they want, there comes a point when they decide to either lower the price or remove the home from the market. Right now, it seems many home sellers are opting for the latter," Mr. Klein said in a statement.
"Home sale activity has been below historical averages in Greater Vancouver for about seven months. This has caused a gradual decline in home prices of about 6 per cent since reaching a peak last spring," Mr. Klein said.
Sales volume last month marked the second-lowest January since 2001 in Greater Vancouver. And the price index for single-family detached homes in January was $901,000, down 3.1 per cent from a year earlier.
The number of new listings in Greater Vancouver has been faltering, hitting 5,128 last month, or a 10.9-per-cent drop from January of 2012. The total number of properties on the multiple listing service rose 5.6 per cent year-over-year to 13,246 last month, but fell 4.5 per cent from December.
In the Fraser Valley, which includes the sprawling and less expensive Vancouver suburb of Surrey, there were 617 properties sold last month, down 23 per cent from the 799 that changed hands in January of 2012. Like the Greater Vancouver board, the Fraser Valley group said it uses the home price index, which strips out the most expensive properties, because that serves as a better barometer of trends than average prices. January index prices on the multiple listing service in the Fraser Valley rose 0.7 per cent over the past year to $420,900. Over the past six months, however, prices have slipped 2.5 per cent.
Scott Olson, president of the Fraser Valley board, said some prospective buyers are taking a wait-and-see attitude in the hopes that prices will dip in 2013.
But with low interest rates and prices holding steady despite a slowdown in sales, there should be pent-up demand to restore balance to local real estate markets, Mr. Olson said.

Full text:   She may have stopped drinking - for the most part - but Ronnie Negus, the wealthy, puffy-lipped Real Housewife of Vancouver with the oceanfront estate and the California vineyard, says the show's portrayal of her as a sloppy, sometimes hostile alcoholic is not, in fact, real.
Negus offers a concrete example: That scene in the first season, where she's doing her bull-riding routine and waving a scarf around, yelling "Arriba!" - obviously hammered? The display, she confides, followed an unscheduled three-hour break during which the cameras were supposedly broken. What else was she supposed to do with the downtime other than drink?
"You know, they filmed 3,000 hours, and 11 make it," said Negus this week. "Was I drunk all the time? Hell, no."
Turn up your nose at the content - or the producers' methods for achieving it - but The Real Housewives of Vancouver is one of the few bright spots in the B.C. film-and-TV industry, which is currently fighting for its life as more attractive tax credits out East lure shows away from British Columbia, or threaten to. Housewives may not have the production budget, or job opportunities, of a big feature film or long-running scripted series, but it's a ratings success - not to mention a weekly commercial for Vancouver, with its beautiful scenery and people. Negus, for one, with her great looks and great wealth, seems right out of central casting.
"Life's a journey," she says, in voice-over as viewers see her strolling, bikini-clad, on a dock in the show's Season 2 opening sequence, which airs Tuesday. "It's just more fun on a private jet."
With a format licensed from NBC, which produces the series in a number of U.S. markets, The Real Housewives of Vancouver is a 21st-century sociological experiment in narcissism, voyeurism and good old-fashioned schadenfreude : Throw five or six rich, underemployed women into a spa-treatment room or seaside soiree, and let the booze flow and the cameras roll. The many grievances that result may be petty, but the stakes are high.
This week, more than 2,200 reality-TV types - up from some 1,500 delegates last year - descended on Washington for the Realscreen Summit, a non-fiction-TV-and-film industry conference. There, they heard that reality shows make up the lion's share of original prime-time programming on cable, and that last year 31 of the top 50 series on U.S. cable were reality shows. Also in 2012, audiences for unscripted series on the big four American broadcast networks were 25 per cent stronger than the overall scripted series average. "Comedic ensembles are the next big things," said David Paperny, president of Vancouver-based Paperny Entertainment, on his way home from the conference this week. "Shows like Duck Dynasty or its more disreputable cousin Honey Boo Boo are the big thing: situation comedies set in real worlds with real people who know how to make fun of themselves."
In Vancouver, currently struggling with a steep decline in production work, the genre is an important success story, with long-established companies such as Paperny, Force Four and Omnifilm Entertainment developing and producing a wide range of series - and not just wince-worthy stuff like Real Housewives . Shows such as Paperny's Yukon Gold , premiering next week, and Force Four's Border Security aim to educate and inform rather than simply titillate and provoke.
Newcomer Lark Productions hit it out of the park with The Real Housewives of Vancouver when the show premiered last year. The first episode attracted 1.2 million viewers, a Slice record, and remains the top-rated show in Slice's history.
Lark Productions was launched in late 2010 by broadcast veteran Louise Clark. Within a few months, and within two weeks of each other, Lark landed two big series: Housewives ; and Gastown Gamble , picked up by the Oprah Winfrey Network. (Lark's first scripted series, Motive , premieres on CTV right after the Superbowl on Sunday - and it's been picked up by ABC.)
This week, two key Lark contributors opened up about the process behind the creation of the show that has put the company on the map. "It's all about casting," said executive producer Grant Greschuk during an interview in the royal suite of a local hotel, while in the room next door the housewives lunched on salad niçoise and edamame. Added Erin Haskett, executive producer and vice-president of development at Lark, "We made an agreement that we weren't going to do [ Real Housewives ] unless we could find [the talent], because otherwise you'd be making a half-baked show."
Very early in the process, Haskett, in an effort to infiltrate the ladies-who-lunch community, pulled off a National Geographic-style anthropological field mission with a researcher. They put on their best dresses, had their hair and makeup done, and hit a black-tie fundraising gala at a Vancouver steakhouse. "It was very targeted," says Haskett. "It was never an open casting call, because with something like that, you end up with crazies."
In the development stage, the team looked at both Vancouver and Toronto. Vancouver came out on top for several reasons. For one thing, the Rosedale movers and shakers didn't seem to mix enough with the Bridle Path types to produce the connections and conflicts upon which a show like this depends. As well, says Greschuk, "Toronto seemed to be a bit more reserved and we couldn't quite find the right group of women."
"We knew that Vancouver would give us a sexier, more glamorous look," says Haskett. "We'd have the ocean and the mountains and the city of glass, which was just very publicized with the Olympics."
During development, members of the Lark team met with the producers of The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. Working with the California production company, the Canadians noticed that many of the series' writers and directors were refugees from the doomed soap-opera industry. This made sense, says Haskett. "If you think about it, Housewives is the new soap opera. We're the new Dynasty , the new Dallas , or the new General Hospital ."
Maybe we're just hate-watching the Housewives , but Haskett believes it's more than that, a kind of gilded mirror through which we can view an extreme version of our own lives. One of the key messages at Realscreen was that viewers want to feel a range of emotions from reality programming. The key to that, says Haskett, who was in Washington to hear this, is finding a good character: a Ronnie Negus with whom we can somehow relate. Maybe, like Ronnie, we have a special-needs child, and dream of giving her the kind of life that comes with owning your own plane and winery.
"Our housewives are mothers," says Haskett. "They have relationships. They try to have good friendships with their girlfriends. But they live it in an extreme version. They get to do it in amazing heels and with beautiful hair and makeup and great dresses."

Full text:   Human dynamo transformed the world of Canadian stage for young audiences by sheer force of will
Standing before 650 friends, family members and arts power-brokers at a lavish 1988 Toronto dinner in her honour, Susan Douglas Rubes understatedly attributed her success to "luck and people." Luck, she said, had been a recurring theme in her life. When she founded Toronto's acclaimed Young People's Theatre in 1966, "it was a lucky time to start a theatre," she told the crowd. "And you need luck in life."
An objective view would place little stock in the role of serendipity in her life.
Rubes (pronounced Roo-bish) was a barely five-foot-tall human dynamo once dubbed the Pied Piper of children's theatre in Canada. With her "joyously unrestrained passion" for family fare, as one writer put it, Rubes almost single-handedly and certainly single-mindedly transformed the world of Canadian theatre for young audiences. She took a former Toronto Transit Commission horse stable and built it into a $3.3-million institution - the first professional theatre in North America dedicated to performance for young people.
She was the wife of singer and actor Jan Rubes but never lived in his shadow. Journalists couldn't lay off describing her as "cheerful," "a whirlwind," "petite" and "pert." Another oft-used adjective was "relentless."
Rubes, who died in Toronto on Jan. 23 at the age of 87, put the Young People's Theatre (YPT) on the map through sheer force of will. She pleaded, bullied, cajoled, yelled and even cried for funds. ("Certainly I've been known to cry," she said, unrepentant. "There are good things to being a woman and I've decided that I will trade on them.") To serve on the theatre's board was to give blood, went one quip. A friend once mused that if Rubes was ever seated next to a Ford executive at a dinner party, the first thing she would do is ask him for a bus.
"When she was building YPT, whether she was fundraising or dealing with the city or working with designers, she just wouldn't take no for an answer," said her son Jonathan. "She wouldn't leave until she got her way, one way or another."
Together, Rubes and the YPT hired, mentored and shaped dozens of Canadian performers, directors and playwrights, and showed kids and teens there was more to entertainment than movies and TV. Her challenge, as a 1975 article stated, was to convince Toronto audiences that children's theatre was respectable. "They all thought that kids' theatre was what you did if you were unable to do anything else," Rubes said. "They were timid."
Which actors are not, by nature. As a performer herself, she hobnobbed with the cream of Hollywood during its golden age, and perhaps gained her greatest fame as Kathy on the soap opera Guiding Light , a role that generated fan mail well into her 80s.
She rarely spoke of her early life, even to her sons, who suspect it may have been a source of some pain. Born Zuzka Zenta Bursteinova in Vienna in 1925, she was raised in central Czechoslovakia, the only child of affluent Jewish parents. Her grandfather owned a nearby rural estate, where Zuzka learned to ride horses sidesaddle. The family would take frequent trips to the culture-rich city of Brno and back to Vienna, where her other grandfather managed the famous Burgtheater.
"Zuzka spent many hours watching rehearsals and plays, kindling her lifelong love for theatre," noted a 1988 profile in The Globe and Mail's Toronto Magazine.
The fairy-tale life ended with Adolf Hitler's invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1938. Zuzka's father, Alfred, joined a Czech army unit fighting with the Allies and later made it to London. She and her mother, Charlotte, with one suitcase apiece and little money, fled to Paris and, in 1940, to New York on the last trip the liner Ile de France made before the fall of France. "Sometime later," the magazine article bluntly noted, "all four of Zuzka's Jewish grandparents, who refused to leave their crumbling world, were gassed." It was an abrupt end to an idyllic childhood.
Susi Bernstein, as she was now known, spoke no English but was determined to learn it by seeing several movies a week. She graduated from George Washington High School, and depending on which bit of lore one believes, took the name "Douglas" either from the family for whom she babysat or picked it randomly from the telephone book. Susi's mother obtained a divorce, remarried and moved to Pennsylvania, leaving her daughter, now 18, alone in the big city.
Having studied ballet in Prague, she yearned to be a dancer but choreographer George Balanchine said she was too short. Noting her flair for the dramatic, he suggested acting instead. While working as a clerk at Saks Fifth Avenue part-time, she trudged to 109 auditions (she counted) before landing a small role on the School of the Air radio show. In a matter of months, she was working on 27 different radio soaps, plays and series alongside the likes of Katharine Hepburn, Elizabeth Taylor, Charles Laughton and Rex Harrison. Radio would remain her first love.
Her big break came in 1946 when she appeared in the Broadway revival of He Who Gets Slapped . Rubes played the circus dancer and daredevil bareback rider Consuela, a role that won her the first Donaldson Award for best debut on Broadway and kudos from The New York Times, which called her performance "graceful and light."
She was living in a tiny apartment on East 53rd Street when one day a young fellow actor with smouldering looks knocked on her door. "I need sheets," announced Marlon Brando. She gave him the linens along with a stern request to keep the bongo playing down. They went on a single date.
A few months later, Rubes graced the cover of Life Magazine as one of Broadway's rising stars. But Hollywood beckoned, and her movie debut was 1947's The Private Affairs of Bel Ami with George Sanders. After that came Boundaries with Mel Ferrer, in which she played a black teenager, and the sci-fi flick Five, in which the director ordered her to run with a real six-week-old baby. "Could I meet the mother that's stupid enough to allow an actress to run with a month-and-a-half old baby?" Rubes wondered. The request was denied.
She met lanky fellow Czech refugee Jan Rubes while filming Forbidden Journey in Montreal. They did 27 takes of a single kiss, and fell in love. The couple wed in 1950 and settled in New York, where Susan worked on such live TV shows as Studio One and Kraft Theater .
For a decade, she played the role of Kathy Roberts in Guiding Light, first on radio, and starting in 1952 on live television. But Rubes kept having children - three in four years. Producers hid the first two pregnancies with strategically positioned furniture and by seating her in a wheelchair. But when she was expecting her third, they killed off her character, resulting in thousands of letters and calls deluging the network. "Kathy got hit by a bus," her son recalled with a chuckle.
In 1959, the clan decamped to Toronto, where Jan had earlier worked for the Canadian Opera Company. Alone in a new city with three young children, Susan cried for the first two years but was determined to get back into gear once her kids began school.
That's when she saw the paucity of arts programs for them. Also impelling her, as she told actor R.H. Thomson in a series of video interviews done for the Theatre Museum of Canada, were the "abominable" performances for children she had seen at Manhattan's 92nd Street Y. So she started the Museum Children's Theatre in her suburban Toronto kitchen. Backed by some local businessmen, her first production, Alice in Wonderland , opened at the Royal Ontario Museum in January, 1963. Her first show for YPT was The Looking Glass Revue in 1966 at the Colonnade Theatre, aimed at kids age three to seven.
For 11 years after its founding, the YPT bounced from one venue to another (it was one of the very first companies to stage plays in schools). In the mid-1970s, Rubes found an unused brick building on Toronto's Front Street, a former TTC stable turned streetcar repair shop. The place was a dump, with water flooding the floor and a rotting foundation. The city agreed to its use as a theatre, charging annual rent of $40,000, and the place needed $2-million in work. She got it all, squeezing $500,000 from the federal government and $1.1-million from the province, even persuading architect Eb Zeidler to design the place.
Already by 1975, her success in children's theatre was recognized with her induction into the Order of Canada.
The theatre's maiden production in its new home was on Dec. 22, 1977, an adaptation of the Prague theatre Laterna Magika's The Lost Fairy Tale. After that, Rubes seemed determined to show that she took young audiences seriously, with such offerings as John Hirsch's Twelfth Night , The Miracle Worker and The Diary of Anne Frank , starring her old friends Eli Wallach and Anne Jackson.
"We all loved working with her," said Eli's daughter Roberta Wallach, who played the title role. Rubes "had boundless energy ... sparkling eyes and a radiant smile. She and Jan had the kind of love that I see in my parents' marriage as well."
YPT was more than just a stage. It grew into a centre, with a year-round drama school for youth added in 1969, teachers' resources and a community outreach program. Today, said artistic director Allen MacInnis, the theatre stages eight productions a year before 60,000 children and adults. It is still guided by Rubes's motto: "Only the best is good enough for children."
Some of Canada's best-known actors appeared on YPT stages, including Kate Reid, Eric Peterson, Brent Carver, Gordon Pinsent and Martin Short. Albert Schultz, founding artistic director of Toronto's Soulpepper Theatre Company, played Daniel Richler in a 1984 YPT production of Jacob Two-Two Meets the Hooded Fang . "It was there that I first met Susan and experienced, as a very young actor, her generosity and warmth," he recalled. "[She] was a pioneer and those of us lucky enough to make our living in the Toronto theatre community owe all we have to a handful of brave souls such as she."
Rubes's influence extended to critics. In time, noted Patricia Keeney, a York University expert on children's theatre and literature, theatre for young audiences became a legitimate category for the prestigious Chalmers new play award each year, juried by Toronto's Drama Bench (later the Canadian Critics Association).
Weary of fundraising, Rubes became head of CBC radio drama in 1980, a natural fit given her love of the medium. "I haven't totally adapted yet to the first large corporation I've ever worked for," she confided to The Globe midway through her tenure. "Why, it's all about power. That's new to me."
Still, she boosted drama programming, hired a casting director and script editor, and set up a training program that drew hundreds of applications from writers across the country. But she quit six years later because, as she told Thomson, "they wouldn't give me any more air time and they wouldn't give me any more money." She served as president of the Family Channel when it debuted on Canadian pay TV in 1987, until 1989.
Largely driven by the success of the YPT, today there are some 80 theatre companies in Canada targeting young people.
Rubes's final request was to have no memorial service following her death.
She was predeceased by her son Christopher in 1996. Jan Rubes died in 2009. She leaves her sons Jonathan and Anthony, three grandchildren and two half-brothers.

Twenty years ago, casinos were illegal in Canada. Windsor, desperate to remake itself, led the way for gambling in Ontario, and - kaboom - the city's reputation went from cold to colder, exactly like a slot machine.
Now, though, half of Torontonians seem hooked on the idea.
If you want to play with the big fellas, take the time to understand the rules. Make no mistake: Casinos are meticulously planned and designed to captivate. The lugubrious man cave with its dizzying jolts of neon and shrill slots is the classic, high-testosterone model. These days, Las Vegas also offers the casino hybrid, combining gambling with a strip joint, say, or a family-fun circus.
Most recently, Roger Thomas, the head of design for Wynn Resorts, has unveiled a casino designed with a laser-sharp focus on women. Welcome to the casino's cameo as wellness spa - a safe haven! - with white leather furniture and sparkling marble floors. This is the kind of airy playground a casino-happy Toronto can expect to luxuriate in - where time is lost and people gamble more than they had ever planned.
The assault on Toronto to buy into the casino deal has been aggressive. Last month, there were five public consultations, as well as online voting arranged by the ever-solicitous city. Paul Godfrey, chairman of the Ontario Lottery and Gaming corporation (OLG) - who in previous careers championed the ugliest of the city's concrete armadillos by way of the Metro Convention Centre and the dumb-faced Metro Hall - has said that downtown Toronto is OLG's first choice for a casino.
My goodness, is that intended as a blessing or an insult? What may come as news to Godfrey, 74, is that the overbloated casino template, one that the OLG is demanding must handle some 4,000 parking spaces, is an antiquated version of urbanity. Despite the conceptual loveliness of its white marble interiors and lotus blossoms floating in water, a casino has no place in a city fighting - and struggling - for a vibrant urbanity. Programmatically, it's all wrong.
Shake down the bugaboo of casinos - our urbane fear of playing the slots next to potbellied truck drivers in Nickelback T-shirts - and unpack the latest in its sumptuous playground design: You'll find Medusa lurking behind the colourful, hand-blown chandeliers and garden conservatories.
"Playground design is airier, and generates higher levels of pleasure, so that you'll want to stay longer," Karen Finlay, a professor at Ontario's University of Guelph, and director of the Problem Gambling Research Lab. She estimates that some 300,000 people in her province are seriously addicted to gambling, meaning they'll lie to their family or steal to support their habit. "The wealth and entitlement that the baby boomer feels," she adds, "is a perfect match for the beautiful sanctuary of the casino."
My vote for most beautiful sanctuary: Monte Carlo Casino, initiated to buoy the treasury of the local royalty, and designed as a beaux-arts mansion (1881), in part by Paris Opera House architect Charles Garnier. Because the grand villa, with its welcoming canopy, occupies a modest footprint next to a sweeping plaza with restaurants that spill out onto public terraces affording direct views to the waterfront, I applaud that casino's urban grace. Foreigners arriving by luxury ships or jets are welcome there, though locals are prevented from gambling. I guess that's called looking after your own.
The problem with almost every other casino in the world is that it's designed to be inward looking. Great cities pour people out of buildings and into streets and parks. But check the proposed mega-casino plan by Oxford Properties Group; once three office towers and the north convention centre are demolished, the developer proposes 22 acres of continuous underground convention space - underground is certainly not the way to activate windswept Front Street - with a park that stretches over the railway lines south of the convention centre, into a zone where people do not naturally flow. The casino - about the size as the Art Gallery of Ontario - will be framed within a hotel complex flanking the western end of the site.
Compare that hermetic experience of urbanity to another epic project that Oxford is currently working on across the border: the 26-acre Hudson Yards, a mixed-use development that recently started construction on the west side of Manhattan, where open green space will connect directly to the Hudson River, and where commercial and residential towers will integrate with a school and a major cultural space. Facilitating gambling addiction is nowhere to be found on the program - that's because Mayor Michael Bloomberg has said no to casinos for Manhattan. (The New York Times has reported that Resorts World Casino, which opened last year in neighbourhing Queens, reports regular incidents of rage-filled gamblers punching slot maching when jackpots go cold.)
A few days ago, MGM Resorts International announced a partnership with commercial real-estate giant Cadillac Fairview to potentially develop and operate "a destination-style, integrated resort complex," perhaps on the grounds of the Canadian National Exhibition. One-stop shopping is critical to any mega-casino development, so that revenues are generated and maintained within the complex. Don't expect visitors to wander north to support the artists' studios and indie fashion boutiques along Queen Street West. Cue the buses carrying voracious gamblers into the CNE, something I've witnessed at Casino Rama, a sad gambling hall operated by the Rama first nation, within an easy drive of Orillia, Ont., or, if you're keen enough, Toronto.
In all of these plans, what could date Toronto badly is the requirement for those 4,000 parking spaces. Consider that other cities with mobilized leadership (New York, Chicago, Paris, London, Singapore) are marginalizing cars to make room for new public transit, more citizen fitness and short-haul car rental.
The City of Toronto's public consultations and online voting have now closed; some time in April, the vote will go to city council, which will decide whether the casino will be coming. Bizarrely, a specific hosting fee - the city's cut for hosting the proposed behemoth - has still not been released to the City of Toronto. Meanwhile, online gambling is on the rise; large-scale casinos in Macau and Atlantic City are in serious debt. If Toronto would yank its head out of the man cave, it would realize that many other places - Hong Kong, Rome, New York, and most of Russia - have rejected the seduction of the casino.
Toronto is a city that suffers increasingly from a scattered vision about its own urbanity - and so we blow, sadly, according to the whims of poker-face corporations. A casino undermines everything we should value about city life. It's a gamble we can't afford to make.

Full text:   The unfinished Hellenic Cultural Centre will form the foundation of the largest Jain temple in North America
There are approximately eight million followers of the Jain religion worldwide - and close to 6,000 of them in Toronto - but it's part of their ethos to keep a low profile.
Now that's about to change: For the first time, this community will have their own traditional temple in the city. And at 48,000 square feet, it will be hard to miss.
"It will become another landmark and ... tourist attraction," said Milan Shah, one of the leaders of the local Jain community. On behalf of the Jain Society of Toronto, he teamed up with real-estate developer Moti Champsee to negotiate a $4.8-million deal with the Greek community in June to buy their partially finished Hellenic Cultural Centre on Ellesmere Road and Warden Avenue in Scarborough.
"They had their building [on the market] for over a year and they were asking for $6-million for it," said Mr. Champsee. "We happened to be there at the right time."
The new facility will be the first in the city to be furbished as a temple from the outside, in the ornate style of traditional Jain architecture. (Currently, Jains worship in one of two converted buildings in Etobicoke - a former Anglican church on Rosemeade Avenue, or the Sri Jain Mandir, a converted home on Park Lawn Road.) Once it is completed, in 2016, it will be the largest Jain temple in North America.
Jainism, which has its roots in India, is one of the oldest religions in the world; its primary creed is one of non-violence. One of the temple's goals will be to attract young Jains, many of whom are put off by complicated rituals of the religion, which are in Sanskrit and Hindi."We continuously have an influx of new Jain families coming to Toronto from India," Mr. Champsee said.
"Many parents take a lot of interest in making sure that the youths take part in religious activities," he added. "[But] we have to change our ways in order to attract more youth to our temples." The new temple will have a banquet hall, classrooms, computer rooms and sports complex. Its construction will take time, Mr. Shah explained, because the architectural designs have just been completed in India. Once they've been approved by the city, artisans from the western state of Gujarat will hand-carve every part of the temple. "They will then be brought to Toronto and assembled at the temple site," Mr. Shah said. The new designs will be incorporated into the pre-existing structure.
The Jain Society had been looking for years for a space to build their first traditional temple - they looked at several properties but couldn't find one in the right location that was big enough.
Meanwhile, the Greek Community of Toronto was trying to sell their building. In 2006, they received $2-million in support from the provincial government for the Hellenic centre, but it was put on the block when the funds needed to finish its construction dried up. "We all know 2008, 2009 were bad years for the economy. And so donations stopped coming," explained Nikonas Georgakopoulos, past president of the Greek Community of Toronto.
But the building was zoned by the city as a cultural centre, so it couldn't be sold for commercial purposes. For Mr. Shah and Mr. Champsee, it was a perfect opportunity. With overwhelming support from the community, it only took a few weeks to raise the funds, which they paid in cash to the Greek society.
The Toronto Jain community continues to raise funds by appealing to Jain families one by one. And, says Mr. Champsee, they are getting a great response. They plan to sell their temple building on Rosemeade Avenue once the cultural centre component of the temple is completed next year. The cost of completing two phases of the Jain temple will be close to $10-million. The society hopes to get $2-million for the temple on Rosemeade Avenue, and they have community pledges for $450,000.
Based on the community response, Mr. Shah is confident they will raise the rest over the next few years.
"If the [pace] is maintained - as we witnessed recently when we bought this Greek centre - we should be able to raise the $2.5-million [balance]," Mr. Shah said. "And we have plenty of time on hand."

Full text:   A new Toronto residence by Nelson Kwong and Neal Prabhu eloquently celebrates the texture of the life within
jmays@globeandmail.com
Architect Louis Sullivan's 1896 quip that "form ever follows function" has been invoked by many modern designers to explain why their work is so boring and mindless.
But despite this popular, persistent misuse, especially around the middle of the last century, Sullivan's dictum communicates an important principle always honoured by the best modernist architecture.
It's that, in both nature and art, the appearance of a thing declares, or should declare, the purpose it serves.
This doesn't mean a building has to be blank and plain. (Sullivan's designs were not.) In fact, the principle suggests that the best modern house (for example) will be one that most eloquently celebrates the vim and texture of the life within it.
While visiting new modern dwellings around Toronto, I have often recalled the saying of Louis Sullivan about form and function, simply because more than a few of the structures I've been seeing lately embody its sound sense and good advice.
This is not the case, of course, across the board: The art of building tall in Hogtown, by and large, seems stuck in the dull-as-dishwater 1970s, and not many new high-rises or mid-rises make fresh, vibrant marks on the city's fabric.
In the field of custom single-family homes, however, something exciting is afoot - a reinvention and creative renewal of the best ideas of residential modernism, a very interesting adaptation (often by emerging architects) of venerable notions about form and function to the conditions of a 21st-century metropolis.
For a modest instance of what I'm talking about, take the newest residence by Nelson Kwong and Neal Prabhu, partners in the young local firm of nkArchitect.
Crafted for a suburban couple intent on moving closer to downtown Toronto - an interior decorator and her husband - the 4,600-square-foot house sits on a spacious lot in a comfortable old neighbourhood not far from the intersection of Bathurst Street and Eglinton Avenue West.
The geometry of the building's streetside façade is forthrightly modernist, with large flat-topped, rectangular volumes that boldly express the two levels within. That said, the arrangement is polite to the less adventuresome family homes up and down the block: One volume is clad in warm wood, another in Ontario limestone, another in dark stucco.
These surface treatments soften the visual impact of the otherwise stolid stacking of the abstract three-dimensional forms.
The façade is mainly noteworthy, however, for another reason. If form should reflect function, then a main entrance should look, feel and perform like the significant thing it is. The centrally sited front door of this house is certainly not shy about itself.
It stands in a deep gap strongly defined by large volumes on either side, and it is further emphasized by the presence, alongside it, of an abstract sculpture cobbled from metal and wood.
Nor does this drama end when (as happens in most dwellings) you step over the threshold.
From the doorway, engaging views open up in several directions. To the right, there is a limestone-faced, glassed-in light well plunging down to the basement.
To the left is the handsome glass-framed staircase that descends through a large void to the wide lower level and ascends, past a wall of glass rising above the street, to the upper storey, where the bedrooms are. Straight ahead lies the open-plan interior, with its south-facing wall, which is mostly glass, but opaque enough to provide a welcome separation between the insides of the house and the deck and pool beyond.
Mr. Kwong and Mr. Prabhu's handling of these interior spaces is typically modern, inasmuch as each zone flows into the next without an interruption at floor level. But the designers have pre-empted any sense of emptiness or "glass-house" vacuity by quietly modifying the ceiling-heights from place to place.
In the dining area, for example, the ceiling soars up to high windows in the treetops. It drops down over the adjacent lounge area, creating an atmosphere of relaxed intimacy.
It does so again in the family room - there is no living room as such - though here, in good modernist fashion, coziness is precluded by tall glass partitions that only very lightly indicate the boundary between inside and outside.
Standing in this sector of the house deep inside the city, one can experience the nearness to nature that the European pioneers of the modern movement believed residential architecture should be all about.
As you can probably tell from my descriptions, this bright, airy residence is not strikingly original or innovative - though I found the entry sequence, from front lawn into the inner spaces, highly imaginative and effective. But not every urban house has to be a show-stopper. It's good enough for it to be an embodiment of durable, humane architectural ideals and values - as this house surely is.

How to reap a bumper crop of dividends

Author: Heinzl, John

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/how-reap-bumper-crop-dividends/docview/1282508507/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "The analogy I use when I try to explain it to people is it's like planting fruit trees. When the trees bear fruit you plant the seeds and you get more trees. You don't want to cut down your trees to burn them for firewood, which is what you're doing if you're selling for a capital gain," he says.

Yield Hog spends a lot of time talking to portfolio managers and analysts for their views on dividend stocks. The pros live and breathe this stuff, and you can learn a lot by listening to them.
But you can also learn a great deal by talking to regular folks who have become dividend investors.
So today, we'll switch gears and chat with an average Joe - actually an average Rob.
Rob, whose last name we've left out to protect his privacy, is a 61-year-old government employee in Ottawa. For years he invested in high-fee mutual funds with lousy returns. Last year, he made the switch to managing his own dividend portfolio after hearing a local investing author on the radio recommend the strategy. He's never looked back.
Rob's story illustrates how, with some homework, discipline and a game plan for selecting stocks, a do-it-yourself investor can build a conservative portfolio of dividend-paying companies that will provide a long-term source of income. It also shows how putting the focus on dividends can fundamentally change one's approach to investing.
Before he discovered dividends, Rob felt that the only way to make money in the market was to "buy low, ride the price up and then sell." It was all about trying to generate a capital gain. Indeed, many retail investors see the market as a giant casino where fortunes are made, or lost, based on speculation.
But as he researched dividend investing, he began to see that it's the antithesis of speculation.
"I realized you could hold an investment that would pay you a return on your money," he says. "As a shareholder, I'm an owner of a company, and they're paying me back a percentage of their profits."
If the company's profits are growing, so too should the dividend. Over time, assuming the company remains healthy, the share price should also rise, but this is the icing on the cake for the dividend investor - not the cake itself.
Armed with that insight, Rob began educating himself by reading books, newspapers and investing blogs. He then set out to build a dividend portfolio according to the following criteria:
* The portfolio would consist of 20 stocks. Anything less would not provide adequate diversification, and anything more would require too much time to monitor.
* Dividend yields would range from 3 per cent to 6 per cent. "I didn't want anything below 3 per cent because it's not much of a return, and if it was higher than 6 per cent I wasn't sure how sustainable it would be and I also wondered how much cash was being put back into the business," he says.
* The portfolio would be diversified across the financial services, utilities, energy, real estate, pipelines and telecommunications sectors. "I limited it to Canadian companies, partly because of the dividend tax credit and also because, being a newbie, I decided to stick with companies I know and recognize."
* Each company would have a long track record of uninterrupted - and preferably rising - dividends.
* Each company would offer a dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP).
After he had assembled the portfolio (see table), Rob asked his discount broker to register the shares in his name.
This step, which cost him $50 per company, was required in order to enroll the shares in the DRIP operated by each company's transfer agent.
He chose the "true" DRIP, as opposed to his broker's "synthetic" DRIP, because the former allows reinvestment in fractional shares, so every penny of his dividends is reinvested.
Including the $10 brokerage commission to initially buy the shares, Rob paid $60 in fees per company - or $1,200 in total - to set up his DRIP portfolio, which is worth about $200,000.
The $1,200 in fees may sound high, but it's a one-time expense. What's more, 16 of the 20 companies offer a discount on shares purchased through the DRIP, and 14 of 20 offer an optional share purchase plan that allows him to buy additional shares with no brokerage fees.
If he needs the money in retirement, he'll start taking the dividends in cash.
But right now he's focused on reinvesting.
"The analogy I use when I try to explain it to people is it's like planting fruit trees. When the trees bear fruit you plant the seeds and you get more trees. You don't want to cut down your trees to burn them for firewood, which is what you're doing if you're selling for a capital gain," he says.
Rob's next project is building a spreadsheet to track his dividend reinvestments and the adjusted cost base of the shares (which he'll need to know for tax purposes when he, or his estate, ultimately sells the shares).
Dividends are just one component of Rob's retirement plan. He also stands to collect a government pension, in addition to the Canada Pension Plan and Old Age Security.
Now, instead of worrying about whether his investments are up or down, he sleeps well knowing that his dividends will be coming in for many years to come.
It's a strategy that suits his personality, he says.
"I don't like roller-coaster rides. I don't like having to pay attention to the market to know if my stock has peaked and that I have to sell it. I'm cautious. I'm conservative. I expect my money to work for me."

Full text:   Canada's housing market is a bubble about to burst in some cities, or in the midst of a soft landing. Either way, a crucial piece of information on just what's driving the market is missing in action.
Unlike in other countries such as the United States and Australia, neither the Canadian government nor industry keeps track of the number of foreign buyers or where they come from. Anecdotal evidence about foreign buyers abounds, yet hard evidence is lacking.
It's crucial, missing information. Understanding what's sparking demand in real estate can offer insights into the health of the market and what's driving prices, and to help to predict cycles.
It can also help politicians make wiser decisions, such as whether restrictions may be needed if speculation becomes too high.
"It's very hard to have a policy debate about what we should do when we don't really know what's going on," said Tsur Somerville, director of the University of British Columbia's centre for urban economics and real estate.
On a quiet leafy street north of Toronto, Mr. Zhang - who asked that his full name not be used - taps the walls and inspects the furnace of a $2.68-million home.
He has five days in the city to make his decision. This five-bedroom house, with Jatoba cherry wood floors and a home theatre, is a little over his $2-million budget, but he'll see half a dozen others this week before making a selection.
He's looking to buy because his 15-year-old daughter will be attending private school in Canada later this year. The owner of a steel business in Beijing has applied to immigrate to Canada, and figures he may as well purchase a home now.
"Canada is a beautiful country. It is good for living, for higher education and it is not that populated," said Mr. Zhang, who would eventually buy a $2.2-million home in Oakville, Ont.
Rumours are rife about foreign buyers. In Toronto, Russian and Iranian buyers, flush with cash, are snapping up condos. In Vancouver, Chinese investors are buying luxury apartments. In the Maritimes, wealthy Americans and Europeans are acquiring coastal vacation property.
Estimates of the level of foreign buying are all over the map. In the Toronto and Vancouver markets, they can range from 3 per cent to - in some pockets of the condo market - upward of 60 per cent.
Shifts in the housing market can have huge spillover effects on the broader economy, on everything from retail sales to employment and the building of new shopping malls.
And yet, "we're missing quite a meaningful part of housing activity in this country," said Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Bank of Montreal.
Canada's housing market has boomed since the recession, until lately. Without knowledge of the source of buying, Ms. Cooper said, "we have difficulty assessing just how sticky this money is, how vulnerable we might be to international capital flow changes, or what are the fundamentals that determine what has been extraordinary building and buying in our major cities."
Canadians, meanwhile, are flocking to the U.S. market, snapping up holiday homes in the sun. They are now, by far, the biggest bunch of foreign buyers of American real estate. Just how do we know this? Each year, the National Association of Realtors publishes a study on international buying activity in the U.S. It shows who the biggest buyers are, the fastest-growing nationalities of buyers (Canada, China), where they're buying (Florida, California), why (bargain vacation homes) and how levels of foreign buying change from year to year.
The industry has collected this info for more than five years, gleaned from questionnaires and follow-up emails to 50,000 real-estate agents. It's valuable information for the public, officials - and the industry itself, helping realtors better understand their markets, says Jed Smith, the association's Washington-based economist.
It's a contrast to Canada. CMHC does not monitor or compile data on foreign investors. The Canadian Bankers Association doesn't keep data on this. Nor does the Canadian Real Estate Association. The Bank of Canada doesn't track it, though Governor Mark Carney has noted that heavy investor demand - much of it foreign - "reinforces the possibility of an overshoot in the condo market in some major cities."
As for the federal government, Finance Minister Jim Flaherty told The Globe and Mail last April that it doesn't have a good handle on the amount of foreign money in the country's housing market. .
Monitoring foreign buying in Canada poses challenges. Some buyers purchase homes through local family or a lawyer's office, so on paper they appear to be living in the country. Plus there may be privacy concerns around asking buyers where they come from or why they're buying.
International interest in Canadian property is unlikely to abate any time soon. Volatile stock markets and Canada's reputation for economic stability are luring investors. So are housing prices that are still lower than other major global centres. And, unlike many countries such as Australia and Switzerland, foreigners face no restrictions on home buying.
Interest in Canadian residential real estate among foreign buyers has been steady in recent years, with particular interest from Asia, says Luis Lopez, head of business development, for RBC Wealth Management.
There's also more wealth sloshing around, looking for a safe place to park. Globally, 175,000 people crossed the millionaire threshold last year, led by growth in emerging markets like China and India, according to Boston Consulting. Investors from mainland China tend to see Canada as one of the top destinations for real-estate investment, according to real estate services provider Colliers International.
Tony Ma agrees. The agent in Markham, Ont., has hosted several groups of visiting Chinese buyers in recent months alone. They typically buy a house for $1-million or $2-million, either to live or as an offshore investment. Canada's multicultural communities, affordability and democratic system will continue to lure buyers, he says. "I don't see this market cooling any time soon."

Full text:   Against odds, the Halifax Seed Company has executives from the fourth generation
Emily Tregunno is a fourth-generation family business executive. Some of the employees who work at the Halifax Seed Company Inc. still remember the day that her grandfather, bursting with pride, told them about her birth. Still, despite the national seed trade shows the family visited on holidays and the summers she worked filling seed packets for orders, she never saw the family firm as part of her future.
She and her sister, Alison, went through a period when they thought the seed business was not their destiny, she says.
"We wanted our own identity."
Today, however, Emily is chief of marketing and graphics (she has a BSc in psychology) and Alison is in charge of sales in New Brunswick (she had a career in sports and recreation).
Halifax Seed specializes in seeds, as well as supplies for landscaping and garden centres, golf source supplies and professional growing equipment, and says it has about 75 employees.
It's a rather rare phenomenon in the family business landscape in Canada. A Family Firm Institute study showed that only about 30 per cent of all family-owned businesses survive into the second generation, with only 12 per cent viable into the third, and a mere 3 per cent still operating at the fourth generation and beyond.
According to John Davis, a leading expert on family business from the Harvard Business School, the structure of family business becomes more complicated as it goes through succeeding generations. While the family firm traditionally begins with one person who makes most of the key decisions, the next phase may feature multiple decision makers who may not agree with each other.
"It is rare that sibling-dominated boards accomplish much," Dr. Davis says. If two of them sit on the board, they are "typically quite sensitive to each other" and either avoid confrontations or escalate conflict, he said.
Family businesses that have two or more cousins controlling the company, can have "bloated, highly political boards," Mr. Davis said. However, over time, family businesses may learn the value of a well-run board, he said.
Family businesses are a vital part of the world economy, generating 70 to 90 per cent of global gross domestic product, says Paul MacDonald, executive director of the Canadian Association of Family Enterprise (CAFE), which last year awarded Halifax Seed Company as Family Business of the Year for engaging in all of the best practices that the organization promotes.
In Canada, about half of the Canadian work force is employed by a family business, creating nearly 45 per cent of Canadian GDP, according to the Family Firm Institute. These family businesses have many advantages, according to researchers Danny Miller and Isabelle Le Breton-Miller at HEC Montreal business school, associated with the Université de Montreal: They tend to focus on making long-term investment decisions; they "unite the tribe" so that employees become an extension of the family; they build better connections with customers and suppliers; and they tend to be more decisive because the links between shareholders and management are closer. Therefore, they can respond to changing markets more quickly.
But a lot can go wrong, too. B.C. family business adviser David Bentall of Next Step Advisors Inc. in Vancouver says four things can dismantle a family business: lack of communication, lack of education, lack of governance and lack of planning.
All four of these factors tripped up the Bentall family construction and real estate company as brothers Bob and Clark clashed over the direction of the firm. The second generation, which included David, gravitated toward one side or the other. Although the five Bentall towers loom over Burrard Street, the founding family is no longer owner or operator of the Bentall Kennedy real estate advisory firm.
"We had a lack of communication, we had a lack of education about what's best practice in family business, we had very limited investment in governance - both in the family and the business - and limited investment in planning," he says. " We ended up having challenges and then we placed priority in management succession rather than ownership succession."
Many of the ills that family businesses encounter bubble up as the first generation attempts to hand off the torch to the next. The Tregunno family had no choice but to deal with succession plans. In 2005, the family patriarch, Tim Tregunno, was diagnosed with cancer. He died on Feb. 25 last year at 55.
Currently, his wife Nancy and her brother Mike Barclay, a part-owner since 1983, own the company, while the fourth generation, which also includes Emily's husband Fraser Moir (sales), work in the company.
Emily says she does not know how much her father's illness played into her decision to take a full-time position with Halifax Seed. "I think a lot of it was emotion, too," she says. But there was a need for someone to take a step into marketing and graphics. Emily returned to school and took some design classes.
When Tim became too ill to work in 2010 he died , he set up an advisory board, which helped with succession planning and bringing the remaining family members up to speed on the running of the business.
The advisory board is made up of company outsiders, but they were picked because they understood the family governance, and its values: putting customers and employees first, forging strong relationships with suppliers and customers, and participating in the broader community, such as setting up a scholarship fund with horticultural students at a local community college.
Emily would love the business to continue on for further generations.

Harman Atkins, HomeLife Cimerman Real Estate Ltd.
The Action: Private appointments provided the only avenue to tour this one-bedroom plus den suite midtown, which sold close to the asking price after a handful of showings.
What They Got: Just more than a year ago, this second-floor suite in a new luxury high-rise was outfitted with upgraded features, such as designer tile backsplashes, stainless-steel kitchen appliances and plank laminate flooring.
* Natural light floods the living and dining area and master suite through floor-to-ceiling windows and sliding doors to a 24-foot-long balcony.
* Supporting elements include a four-piece bathroom and laundry room, plus a locker.
* Monthly fees of $288 cover heating costs, concierge and amenities, like a gym, theatre and rooftop deck on the 20th floor.
* Local attractions include shops, restaurants and cinemas on Yonge, along with the subway.
The Agent's Take: "It's a very nicely designed building. It has the aesthetic of a hotel spa more than a condo," says agent Harman Atkins. "This building is located literally steps from all the action of the Yonge and Eglinton area ... but the building is situated on a tree-lined side street in a very residential setting, away from the noise and traffic."
This unit's design was also of high interest to buyers. "It was a small unit - under 600 square feet - but it had a functional layout that included a small den," says Mr. Atkins. "Not all units include a balcony this size - over 24 feet long - with two walkouts."

Full text:   A fixer-upper off the beaten path is transformed into a gorgeous Georgian merger of natural and modern
THE LISTING
Asking price: $1,249,900
Taxes: $4,880.78 (2012)
Lot size: 208 feet by 184 feet
Agents: Brad Douglas (Chestnut Park Real Estate Ltd.) and Alan McPhedran (Homeward Team Realty Inc.)
The back story
'Stonecroft," as the house is known, was built in 1865 near the Grand River by the prosperous businessman J.K. Barrett.
Mr. Barrett, whose ancestors had immigrated from Ireland, was the owner of the mill across the river in the hamlet of Aboyne.
"It was never a farmhouse," says current owner Rebecca Shaw. "It was always more formal."
The property is located on a country road halfway between Elora, Ont., and the smaller town of Fergus, Ont.
Ms. Shaw purchased the house with her husband and their two children six years ago.
They knew the house needed some work but the couple was drawn to the stone exterior and Georgian symmetry.
"I love old houses," says Ms. Shaw. "They always get into your bones."
The house today
Despite the age of the house, Ms. Shaw envisioned a modern addition and renovation.
"I like that tension between the modern and the old and I think they can both work together," says Ms. Shaw.
The original summer kitchen at the side of the house had been turned into a TV room. Ms. Shaw transformed it into a very large mud room with a heated limestone floor, lots of cupboards and a large island with drawers for mittens and baseball gloves and all manner of paraphernalia.
A light-filled addition at the rear combines a kitchen, casual dining area and family room. Ms. Shaw fit in as many windows as she could, and French doors lead to a wrap-around terrace overlooking the yard.
The modern kitchen has built-in appliances and granite countertops.
Ms. Shaw had the original crown mouldings and Georgian-style windows replicated throughout the house - including in the kitchen - but she eschewed curlicues and old-fashioned details because she prefers to cook in an environment that doesn't feel too busy.
"I've been through so many Victorian kitchens. I wanted to keep everything simple."
The floors are reclaimed hemlock and the stone walls of the original exterior have been left exposed. A modern glass and stainless steel railing in the family room is juxtaposed against the grey stone.
"I'm drawn to the natural elements - steel and glass and wood," says Ms. Shaw.
The dining room, living room and staircase in the old part of the house have been left mostly as they have always been. The windows still contain the original glass panes.
"I still love this room," says Ms. Shaw of the living room. "There's something about the light quality in here."
On the lower level, the recreation room has a walk-out to the garden. The landscaped yard includes tall trees, a rock garden and terrace.
The renovation was a major undertaking: When builders straightened the main beam, plaster and lathe fell off of the walls.
But when it was all finished, the house had expanded to 4,000 square feet.
Ms. Shaw says Elora is a small town that fosters lots of community involvement. Her teen and pre-teen kids can head downtown by themselves, she adds.
The arts scene and the Elora Gorge Conservation Area draw lots of visitors to the town. The historic Elora Mill Inn has long been a local landmark and plans are underway to redevelop the inn and the downtown area with new shops, conference facilities and condominiums.
The best feature
Upstairs, the addition at the rear contains the luxurious master suite. The bathroom is open to the bedroom with a large soaker tub dividing the two areas.
"We really enjoy the openness," Ms. Shaw says of the views from the bathtub to the trees beyond.
The bedroom has cathedral ceilings, a fireplace and French doors leading to a Juliet balcony.

Abstract: With [Grey]'s opening, Red's skiable area jumps to 1,084 hectares from 681. It's a big moment in Red's long history. Ski-club volunteers built Western Canada's first chairlift here in 1947. It ran for 26 years, which is impressive for a rig of used mining equipment. The gear had come from inside the mountain, at one time the biggest gold mine in British Columbia.

Full text:   The wolverine den is directly beneath the Motherlode chairlift. It's near the top of Granite Mountain, where the pitch gets steeper and snow-covered ledges make the run a favourite for skiers who like showing off under a lift.
For several years, visitors have spotted animal tracks in the snow, leaving the den and heading across the ski hill to the trees. Sometimes there's blood on the tracks. Locals assumed it was a lynx living in there, but a ski patroller set up a camera last month and discovered it was a wolverine.
This is an animal that chases wolves and bears off carrion. Pound-for-pound, the wolverine is the meanest set of claws and teeth on the planet. Which makes it a fitting mascot for Red Mountain Resort in Rossland, B.C., home to some of the toughest skiing in North America.
The question is, will Red maintain its wolverine spirit now that it has opened a slew of bunny runs?
The biggest news in ski circles this year is Red's expansion to adjacent Grey Mountain. The resort's two peaks, Granite and Red, have an abundance of steep tree skiing, but are sorely lacking in intermediate terrain. The Grey expansion will double the supply of cruisers.
Seven runs have been cut, with two more planned this summer. Until a lift is raised, skiers pay $10 a ride for a 10-minute snowcat shuttle to the top of Grey from Granite, to get a sense of what Red Mountain will become.
For the sake of habitat, the wolverine would probably prefer that Red stays the way it is: uncrowded and focused on tree skiing, not clearcut runs. Don Thompson, Red's vice-president of operations, says the new terrain on Grey was cut judiciously, with advice from biologists and close attention paid to riparian corridors along waterways.
I hopped on the snowcat for a trial run on Grey with some ski patrollers doing set-up days before the official opening in late December (the day after Red sent out a press release claiming 65 centimetres of snow in three days).
Despite its name, Grey sparkled. Sun on two feet of fresh snow put the whole expansion idea in a good light. Grey's pitch starts off in gentle green-beginner run territory near the saddle it shares with Granite, and gets gradually steeper the further east you traverse along the southern aspect out toward its nose. This puts most of the face in the blue-square sweet spot of trail maps. A series of gradual rolls keep the fall line undulating in interesting ways and the pitch will be steep enough for mildly ambitious skiers to play with the turning arc of shaped skis on groomed corduroy. (This week the grooming crew started their lonely night shifts to smooth out Grey.)
But getting to it before the crowds, I was glad to have swapped my shaped skis for wide powder boards. The same pitch that will make these runs moderate cruisers in packed snow conditions also happen to be just right for wide, sweeping, snow-spraying turns in two feet of fresh Kootenay crystals.
With Grey's opening, Red's skiable area jumps to 1,084 hectares from 681. It's a big moment in Red's long history. Ski-club volunteers built Western Canada's first chairlift here in 1947. It ran for 26 years, which is impressive for a rig of used mining equipment. The gear had come from inside the mountain, at one time the biggest gold mine in British Columbia.
The miners left two legacies. One is a smattering of abandoned shafts that tree skiers would do well to be mindful of.
Most locals have a story about dropping into a powdery depression they think was once filled with gold (they've all managed to climb out). The other is the town of Rossland, which rubs up against the backside of Red Mountain itself.
Rossland is at once one of the highest (at 1,023 metres) and most down-to-earth cities in Canada. It occupies most of a bowl that geologists say is an ancient volcano crater, giving its topography a more mountainous feel than other B.C. ski towns such as Fernie or Golden (near Kicking Horse). It was laid out in Wild West style in the 1890s, which means the main street was plenty wide to accommodate the moose that ambled down it this week.
The ski resort is within walking distance for the ambitious, which may be one reason why Powder magazine named Rossland the best ski town in North America last month (in tandem with Nelson, 75 kilometres to the north). Another reason might be the hundreds of proud and protective skiers who have come from around the world to live here. Commerce and culture - just enough of each to sustain the 5,000 residents - are found exclusively along a few blocks of vibrant Columbia Avenue. If you want to cross the road to get from the hardware store to the knitting store, step off the sidewalk. The cars will stop. If you want to get to the hill, stick out your thumb.
The Grey Mountain quad chairlift presently sits stacked and coiled near Red's base. The plan, not yet officially guaranteed, is to raise it this summer, so that next season a 14-minute ride will gain 760 metres up a mountain that, like Granite, can be skied a full 360 degrees. Couloirs to the north, sunny groomed runs to the south.
The groomers happen to provide a good vantage of Granite's unforgiving north face. As I stopped to rest on my last run down Grey, I looked across the valley and tried to pick out some of Granite's notorious tree-skiing runs such as Needles and Cambodia. Those thin lines will continue to draw hard-core skiers. But with the expansion, more diversity will be on offer. Skiers wanting a full range of terrain will finally feel at home at Red Mountain. It's not just for wolverines any more.

Full text:   Many Torontonians will recognize the phenomenon: A formerly unremarkable neighbourhood is touted as both "up-and-coming" and the "next big thing." The latest area in the trendsetters' crosshairs? The west-end neighbourhood known as the Junction.
This time, though, these bold forecasts are based on very real evidence. Some two dozen art and design businesses can be found on the 1.4-kilometre stretch of Dundas West between Keele and Runnymede streets alone - most of which only cropped up in the last decade. As the third annual Toronto Design Offsite Festival, showcasing the best of Canadian design, kicks off this weekend throughout 10 Junction venues, the area's Business Improvement Area agrees that the 'hood is well on its way to being one of the city's top art and design destinations.
"It definitely feels that way," said BIA executive director Kristina Skindelyte, noting that three local businesses are also participating in the upcoming massively attended Interior Design Show. Add to that the concentration of various galleries and design shops in the area, and it's tough to ignore the hype.
Artists certainly aren't. Gallerist Jessica Bradley set up her second space near St. Clair and Old Weston Road in 2012. Along with Narwhal, it can be counted among the city's most exciting contemporary-art galleries, according to Vanessa Nicholas, exhibitions assistant co-ordinator at the OCAD U student gallery.
"In my mind, the Junction is definitely an exciting destination for arts and design-interested folks," says Ms. Nicholas.
In the time-honoured tradition of urban gentrification, the artists arrive first and young professionals then follow. In the case of the Junction, the two are flocking there at once, though the neighbourhood's isolation keeps the area from changing too fast.
Kristin Weckworth, the mastermind behind Narwhal and its sister gallery Magic Pony, describes the Junction as "Brooklyn without the Bedford subway stop" - a gentle jab at the Toronto neighbourhood's off-the-subway-map co-ordinates.
"It's diverse with a strong sense of community, energy and independence," she observes, noting that those singular traits were the impetus for the gallery's recent move from Queen West. "It still feels like anything is possible here."
Kalpna Patel, who designs the window displays for Queen West's Type Books in addition to running her own jewellery and design business (appropriately named Old Weston) out of a Junction studio space, has lived in her family's Junction home since 1986 - her entire Toronto life - and watched the creative community blossom around her.
"Not leaving home was the best thing I could have done," she half-jokes.
Ms. Patel attributes the neighbourhood's boom in creative enterprise, at least partly, to real-estate prices. "There are a lot of artists living here right now, since it is one of the few affordable places in the city and there are affordable studio spaces," she observes. But, while people may be attracted to the Junction for pragmatic reasons, they stay for its charms.
Micah Lenahan can attest. The owner of design shop Russet & Empire, Ms. Lenahan is renowned for hosting massive themed parties at her store, with prodigious turnouts.
"It seems weird to think that 500 people are going to come to a party in the winter in the Junction and take the subway to Dundas West station, then take the 40 bus," she says. "But people do it. They do it in droves."
Ms. Lenahan joined forces with fellow area business owner Paul Mercer to form the Junction Flea in the spring of 2012. The monthly outdoor bazaar of locally made and sourced goods proved so successful, it's continued into an all-season event with a winter home in Queen West's Great Hall.
"You have a lot of flexibility to play around with your ideas, because there's not so much money riding on everything," she agrees. "There's more creative freedom."
"There is so much creativity in the neighbourhood that echoes both from the people who live here - and many of them also shop locally - and the businesses too," says Ms. Skindelyte. "The community feels very artistic."

Full text:   Subterranean network set up to combat flooding provides unlikely - and dangerous - home for poorest residents of city that lays claim to the country's fourth-highest homelessness rate
The flood came without warning. Perhaps it was runoff from nearby Mount Charleston, or buildup from a rare day of desert rain. A wall of water, head-high, rushed through one of the storm tunnels that run beneath Las Vegas. Seconds later, everything Richard Ethridge and Cynthia Goodwin owned was swept away. As had been the case before, and will almost certainly be the case again, the married couple barely made it out alive.
"I almost lost her," Mr. Ethridge, 39, says, his wife sitting beside him on a sheet of foam bedding, their subterranean home lit only by a couple of candles in broken glass jars. "She was in another tunnel holding on to her bike. The water was so strong it ripped the front tire off the bike."
The Las Vegas Boulevard strip is perhaps the glitziest and most distinctive stretch of real estate in the world, synonymous with blinding neon lights and gaudy excess. It regularly draws millions of tourists, big-name celebrities and massive conventions.
But the city around the strip has the fourth-highest homelessness rate and the highest home foreclosure rate of any big city in the country. As a result, many of its estimated 12,000 homeless people have built makeshift shelters in the city's 480 kilometres of underground storm tunnels. The result is a subtropolis where the poorest and most maligned can escape the desert heat and cold, even as they risk disease and drowning.
The network of tunnels dates back to the late 1980s, when local and state governments attempted to flood-proof the area. Homeless people began seeking shelter there about 15 years ago, in part prompted by a growing crackdown on the Las Vegas homeless population. The city passed ordinances that, among other things, made it illegal to offer food to "the indigent" in public parks.
"Vegas has built up a reputation as one of the meanest cities towards the homeless," says Matthew O'Brien, a writer who runs a charity called Shine a Light that provides help to the people living there.
But for many of its residents, the tunnel network offers advantages over the city's streets. In the summer, the tunnels can be several degrees cooler than the surface, and in the winter, they are warmer. Made of concrete blocks three metres wide and 1.8 metres tall, they also protect against bursts of desert wind.
But the same structures are deadly. Las Vegas sees only about 11 centimetres of rainfall annually - but when the water does arrive, it builds up quickly, rising as much as 30 centimetres a minute as it races through the drains. As a result, Las Vegas also sees roughly one drowning each year in the flood channels.
"The last great wash was four months ago; it wiped me out," says John Aitcheson, a 53-year-old Florida native who says he has spent the past two years living underground in Vegas. "It took my shopping cart straight to Lake Mead."
Mr. Aitcheson's home is a tunnel at the end of a natural wash less than a kilometre south of the strip. Immediately to the west are the immaculate greens of the Bali Hai Golf Club. On the other side of the street is the VIP terminal at McCarran Airport. All day, the private jets create an overbearing roar and golf course sprinklers send a stream of water that leaves the tunnel floor permanently damp.
With no natural light , the cramped tunnel where Mr. Aitcheson lives is mostly pitch-black. The sides of the walls are lined with soot from deliberate and accidental fires. Mounds of cigarette butts line the ground, proximal to the half-dozen or so encampments of the people who live here. The air is pungent , a mixture of cigarette smoke and urine.
At the end of the wash, the tunnel splits in two. The residents use one tunnel as a living space and the other as a trash can and toilet. Whenever the rain comes, it tends to clean the tunnels of waste, something the residents call "flushing the toilet."
Despite the obvious risks of disease, drowning and even scorpion bites, some tunnel residents have turned their living areas into a home. One recent afternoon, in a storm drain five kilometres east of the strip, Mr. Ethridge and Ms. Goodwin are rebuilding. A day earlier, city workers cleared out the tunnel, as they do several times a year, taking the couple's queen-size bed and many other belongings. In less than 24 hours, the couple found new bedding, built a couch out of milk crates and salvaged supplies from trash cans at a nearby Burlington Coat Factory.
The walls bear the marks of countless people who called this place home. Almost every space is covered in graffiti - poems, profanity, murals of visiting aliens. Inside the couple's bedroom, Ms. Goodwin has painted a fake window on one of the walls - a sunny square with rolling green hills. Just outside the bedroom, a slow drip of black water lands from a vent in the ceiling, the result of a broken sewer pipe.
Like many people struggling with poverty, the couple have few means of escape . For a while, they say, they lived in an apartment, until discovering their landlord was simply changing the locks on foreclosed homes and renting them out.
"It's hard to get a job when you've got no address," says Ms. Goodwin, a tiny 46-year-old who occasionally works as a housekeeper. "We can give them a cell number, but you don't get reception down here."
The couple have also developed survival skills . They stagger a row of tin cans down the back of the tunnel. When the rain approaches, the cans tumble, making noise and giving them advance warning. They get by. They are in love.
"We've been married for almost 12 years and I still look at him all goofy," Ms. Goodwin says.
Still, like all the people living below the bright lights of Vegas, they know the next time it rains, much of what they have will be gone.
"Anything we can't get out to the top, we watch float away," Mr. Ethridge says.

In Stratford, the flow's the thing

Author: Leblanc, Dave

Abstract: Mr. [Luc Bouliane]'s commercial experience and attention to detail shine in the kitchen. The island, in particular, is a lovely, curved "hockey stick" affair with a wide granite top that would not be out of place in a trendy café. "It's not a typical residential application," agrees the architect. Interjects Mr. White: "And that's certainly what we were after too."

Full text:   The musty interiors of the backward 1980s are swept away by careful subtraction and refreshing modernist lines
daveleblanc@globeandmail.com
What was it about 1980s interiors? Chopped-up floor plans, heavy oak millwork, flashy brass trim-amajigs and muntin bar madness on windows. The colours didn't help, either: dark forest greens, peaches and pinks, and a battalion of browns and blacks. Chairs, couches and curtains were smothered by flowery chintz, floors by sculpted carpet.
If it weren't for the playful furniture created by Ettore Sottsass and others in the Memphis group, this might be a decade better left buried under all the gewgaws.
In April, 2011, architect Luc Bouliane encountered this sort of space when he visited a Stratford, Ont., home purchased by Rick White and Sandy Bourque that had languished on the market for a year.
"There was absolutely no flow inside the house," Mr. White says.
In addition to some of the above offences, Mr. Bouliane, 34, found other head-scratchers, such as randomly placed brick "feature" walls interrupting the flow of feet (and light) in hallways and landings, and not one, but two fireplaces crowding the entrance hall. There was also a large "sunroom" addition poking out the back that, ironically, blocked sunlight from getting into other parts of the home.
The funny thing is, this place had been built, originally, in the open-plan-obsessed mid-1950s, and on a lovely dead-end street that's more forest than street. Not that you could tell: From the road, the myriad 1980s additions - and the bumpy peach brick they came dressed in - all but obscured those lines. And from inside the house, a viewer could barely tell that the large, two-hectare property featured every kind of tree imaginable, flowers, a ravine with a creek, and looked onto a golf course across the street.
"Here was a house with a beautiful landscape," chuckles Mr. Bouliane, "with no interior connections to that landscape."
Needless to say, the design process didn't take very long. This was a relief, since prior to meeting Mr. Bouliane, Mr. White, a marketing executive, and Ms. Bourque, a documentary producer, had spoken with a number of firms who "didn't seem to have any thoughts beyond our own about what was necessary," says Ms. Bourque, "and a lot of the things that we wanted to do they thought were kind of difficult."
Obviously, after a decade at the highly respected firm of Teeple Architects - masters at solving difficult commercial, institution and residential problems alike - Mr. Bouliane, working solo as LBA since 2010, was up for the challenge.
After eight months of construction and a $500,000 budget, the house has been released from its eighties chains and is as crisp and clean as an Ontario apple (indeed, there are fruit trees outside too) with "small-m" modernist lines and a neutral materials palette. While a few spaces in the basement remain untouched, the rest of the home has been completely reworked to open up the flow on the main floor - "there were five rooms on this floor before Luc got at it," says Ms. Bourque - as well as the second and, perhaps more importantly, to open up views to the lushness outside via an enormous, cedar-wrapped wall of glass along the north wall. Had it not been for the elimination of the sunroom, this would not have been possible: "This is the first house I've renovated where I actually made it smaller," quips Mr. White with a laugh.
On the west wall, which never had windows, Mr. Bouliane has bookended the new, large fireplace (there was an anemic one previously) with floor-to-ceiling beauties that carry the eye into the pines; one window stretches to the master bedroom upstairs. And if trees aren't counterpoint enough to the brooding, basalt-clad fireplace, the turquoise Italian sofa fills the bill. Built into each side of the fireplace is a bookcase, where light switches hide along with the Penguin classics.
Two types of flooring - ceramic tile and a rustic-looking engineered wood - demarcate different zones: Tile sits under the glass wall for those entering with wet winter boots or pool-soaked feet, and slips underneath the dining table as well, while wood occupies hallways and living areas.
Mr. Bouliane's commercial experience and attention to detail shine in the kitchen. The island, in particular, is a lovely, curved "hockey stick" affair with a wide granite top that would not be out of place in a trendy café. "It's not a typical residential application," agrees the architect. Interjects Mr. White: "And that's certainly what we were after too."
The stove is sheltered under the window-wrapping cedar brow so the cook can ponder the sky while stirring and simmering, and everywhere are calculated nooks and crannies where light switches hide or, lower down, where crumbs can be swept into a hungry suction-hole. And while some of the details aren't "important in terms of functionality," it's worth noting that all of the angles and depths line up with one another. "It's really important to how you read the spaces connecting," says Mr. Bouliane.
Similarly, upstairs, a once-cluttered corridor now directs the eye straight across to a new window with the help of thin, floating ceilings that hide new beams. Former storage doors have been removed to create a series of alcoves for the couple's artwork.
Executed by local contractor Bill Donaldson, this home is now married to its stunning lot. And the 1980s have been relegated to the radio.

Abstract: Offset House is a good, small instance of deft creative infill: modern without being stiff or cheerless, artistically inventive without being outlandish, urbane and sophisticated without a trace of pedantry. It's also an imaginative contribution to Toronto's evolving idea of the little, side-street contemporary house - a building type that's bound to be ever more important as local land prices continue to soar.

Full text:   Offset House earns high praise for an intelligent approach that makes good use of a sliver of land
jmays@globeandmail.com
Like players of extreme sports, architects of detached infill housing must downright relish difficulty. Shoe-horning livable modern space into built-up city fabric is rarely easy, after all, and ensuring that home-owners get adequate sunshine and ventilation in tight circumstances is often tricky.
Then there's the aesthetic problem. Short of retiring timidly and taking on the appearance of everything else in the old neighbourhood - almost always a bad move, in my view - how should an infill house make a fresh mark on its streetscape and surroundings?
Boldly , is the answer given by the three young designers of an attractive new 1,800-square-foot residence in the Davisville district of uptown Toronto. (This striking house is currently on the market for just over $1.6-million.)
Architect Nima Javidi and associates Hanieh Rezaie and Behnaz Assadi are the authors and developers of this unusual project, which they call Offset House. The name indicates their most conspicuous design gesture, intended to maximize the building's southern exposure.
Working with a long, skinny lot that runs east-west, the team dropped the walk-in level of the house along the southern edge of the property, then set down an upper level that's pulled smartly northward. The top volume appears to be cantilevered laterally over the lower volume, in other words, and the whole composition looks like two bricks stacked inexactly on top of one another. If I'm making this arrangement sound complicated, it's really not fussy or eccentric at all - and it gives the building an up-tempo, modern face (finished in white stucco, large wood-framed windows and ornamental wooden shutters) that brightens an otherwise dowdy streetscape.
Interestingly, the scheme did not require any easing or adjustment of the zoning bylaws that prevail in this neighbourhood: The structure sits neatly inside the envelope occupied by the two-storey dwelling that preceded it.
But while the exterior of Offset House is modest in size and respectful of building scales round about, the interior is sleek and chic, and efficient without being even slightly chilly. It's the kind of place, one imagines, that will appeal to a couple who began their life together in a little condominium suite in a tower, but who now want to start a family. Most things the couple learned to like about condo living are here: the hardwood floors, the open plan on the first level, big windows everywhere, the modern kitchen and bathrooms. The ceilings are taller than they would be in a condo, however - almost 16 feet in the master bedroom, 10 feet in the other two bedrooms.
And the level of detail is certainly higher than what most condo-dwellers can afford, or even find. During a recent visit to Offset House, I was struck by the engagingly intricate interlocking of spaces, for example. Ceiling heights vary according to what's above: a rear bedroom perched high in the treetops allows the area below to billow, while the master bedroom, suspended in the centre of the building, compresses the kitchen and dining area, lending them welcome intimacy.
As far as detail goes, however, the most impressive feature is the care taken by the designers to guarantee that each space (even in the hard-to-light middle) is washed by natural light. The stairwell and the long bridge connecting the two smaller bedrooms, for example, is illuminated by a sequence of skylights that runs the length of the flat roof, bringing in lots of Toronto's soft cloud-shine and whatever direct sunshine we get here.
Offset House is a good, small instance of deft creative infill: modern without being stiff or cheerless, artistically inventive without being outlandish, urbane and sophisticated without a trace of pedantry. It's also an imaginative contribution to Toronto's evolving idea of the little, side-street contemporary house - a building type that's bound to be ever more important as local land prices continue to soar.

Full text:   REAL ESTATE REPORTER
The sharp year-over-year decline in national home sales that weighed on the housing market through the second half of 2012 persisted right through to the new year, the Canadian Real Estate Association is expected to report Tuesday when it releases December's figures.
Observers now expect the softness to continue into 2013, and foresee the decline in sales causing price growth to stagnate. But many suggest this is healthy: if prices hold flat for much of the year while the economy and incomes continue to grow, that should remove some froth from the market, decreasing the chances of a more significant correction when interest rates rise and eat into affordability.
"Stepping back and looking at the market overall, it is clear now that it peaked nationally in the May to June time frame," Royal LePage CEO Phil Soper said in an interview. "This cyclical correction is well under way, and I would expect that it would continue through the first half of 2013."
When the real estate agency made its 2012 predictions about a year ago, it assumed that interest rates would rise in the latter part of the year. But low rates continue to support housing demand.
"It appears now that we are going to have a very supportive interest-rate mortgage environment right through this year and probably through the spring market of 2014, so when you look at the natural cyclical correction that we were due for, but you plot that against strengthening job numbers and supportive monetary policy, I really do think that this will be a relatively mild correction in the Canadian housing market, with regional variations," Mr. Soper said.
The market is still feeling the lagged impact of tighter mortgage insurance rules and bank lending restrictions that took effect this summer, "but I don't think the government has gone too far," said TD Bank chief economist Craig Alexander. "Quite frankly I think the cooling that we're having in the market is healthy."
A number of economists and policy makers have been concerned that house prices and consumer debt levels were rising too far, too fast.
"I do believe the December sales numbers are going to be weak, and then we probably are going to have a few more months of weakness, but there's a possibility that the markets could start to stabilize as early as the spring," Mr. Alexander added, noting that the impact of recent rounds of rule tightening generally lasted for only a couple of quarters.
Data already released by local real estate boards indicate the numbers won't be pretty, said Scotiabank economist Derek Holt.
"The number of existing homes sold fell by an average of 18.6 per cent year-over-year using a sample that includes Vancouver, Toronto, Ottawa, Calgary, Edmonton, Kitchener, the Fraser Valley, Victoria, Saskatoon, and Regina, according to a number compiled by Bloomberg," Mr. Holt noted. "The steepest declines were in Vancouver (down 30.6 per cent year-over-year), Saskatoon (down 20.8 per cent year-over-year), and Toronto (down 19.5 per cent year-over-year); in other words, it looks to be a national phenomenon."
"I think it will be a report with a lot of minus signs," said CIBC economist Benjamin Tal.
Calgary is an outlier, with sales nudging up 5.7 per cent. Prices in that city were up 8.6 per cent from a year earlier, but the Calgary Real Estate Board is forecasting sales growth to slow to 2 per cent in 2013. It expects prices to rise by 2.9 per cent this year.
"While some major markets in Canada are contracting, we're in a position of expecting some growth," Bob Jablonski, president of the Calgary Real Estate Board's board of directors, said in a press release.
Vancouver, the Fraser Valley and Regina, on the other hand, each saw prices drop from a year ago in December. And Toronto's market will be closely watched in the year ahead, with many experts calling for a significant slowdown in the condo market.
"The condo builders seem undeterred in Toronto, they're still going for permits like crazy," said Robin Wiebe, an economist at the Conference Board of Canada.

Full text:   Passersby stop in confusion when they first see it.
A longboard store, dead in the heart of a Chinatown once dominated entirely by tea shops, basket and bamboo emporiums and restaurants of the Jade Garden and New Town variety.
"The 70-and-up crowd, they come and peer in the window and then walk away. I don't know what they're thinking of it all," said Mischa Chandler Farivar, perched behind the counter of the five-month-old Flatspot Longboards on East Pender, Vancouver's most historic Chinatown street.
But others come in, Chinese kids with their parents. The parents reminisce about coming to Chinatown with their families for far different reasons when they were young. The kids eventually leave with a longboard - an edgier form of skateboard - paid for by the nostalgic parent.
Mr. Farivar, 21, is part of the newest wave of gentrification to wash over Chinatown and the Downtown Eastside. It's one that is generating another round of protests from advocacy groups fighting to keep the area feeling like home to its traditional poor residents.
But the newcomers are being welcomed, even encouraged, by the Chinatown business establishment and the old-time Chinatown associations.
In fact, Mr. Farivar and a cluster of new business owners around him have all rented from the Chinese Freemasons, the benevolent association that operates two commercial buildings and two housing non-profits in the area.
Those new businesses include a row of four stores along Columbia Street around the corner from Flatspot - Duchesse, a vintage store; The Shop, a space that sells coffee and clothing with a vintage-motorcycle theme; two art galleries - and a German-sausage-and-beer deli called Bestie about to open across the street on Pender.
Several blocks away on the edge of Chinatown, another entire block has turned into a poster row of new Vancouver businesses: clothing stores like Charlie & Lee and Board of Trade Co., and locavore-themed food operations like Harvest and The Parker.
Many of the new business owners are a slightly different crowd from the previous waves of gentrification the past decade in Chinatown, which included Bob Rennie's real-estate business and art gallery, some high-end furniture shops, and hip restaurants and bars like Bao Bei and the Keefer.
These new businesses operate on the smallest of margins. The owners reject the idea that they are gentrifiers. And they live near the area - sometimes even in it.
"I think we're the first Caucasians to live in this building since it was built in 1911," said Mr. Farivar. He and his partner, as part of their lease, are renting small apartments above the longboard store and getting to know their new neighbours - a mahjong club, several older Chinese men renting small rooms, and the Freemasons' headquarters.
The two young men about to open Bestie say they see themselves as serving a local market.
The two raised $16,000 through Indiegogo, an online crowd-funding platform, which essentially asked future customers to buy meals in advance.
"A lot of people who bought cards live and work in the area," said Clinton McDougall, noting that the area is filled with graphic-design, film, app-development and art studios. "Our mainstay is those people like us."
Mr. Farivar grew up in Toronto's Kensington Market, which is part of that city's Chinatown, so he understands some of the concerns about people like him moving into Vancouver's Chinatown.
"I watched Kensington Market get gentrified, people get pushed out," said Mr. Farivar, who is also completing a degree at Quest University in Squamish. He doesn't want to push anyone out, and is working hard to fit into the area without performing "cultural appropriation."
But he also says Chinatown is inevitably going to change.
"I don't think it's fair to the rest of Vancouver to keep this neighbourhood inhibited. If you don't want gentrification to be so detrimental, you need to take some ownership."
That echoes what local Chinese business groups and associations are saying.
"We're quite pleased with the way this is working out. It's diversification," said Gil Tan, the real-estate director for the Chinese Freemasons who decided to rent storefronts to Flatspot, Bestie, Duchesse and the others.
"Somebody did ask, 'Is that appropriate to have a longboard shop in Chinatown?' But I said the only way to revitalize this area is to bring people in. I like those shops. It's kind of fun."
Albert Fok, president of the Chinatown Business Improvement Association, said the new businesses are helping fill some of the vacant storefronts that have become more prevalent in the past few years.
"It's a perfect match. I welcome such a change," said Mr. Fok. "Some people are worried about the watering down of Chinatown. But if it makes the community thrive again, so be it."
There's about a 10-per-cent vacancy rate in Chinatown right now, with a high number of shops empty on the block of Pender east of Flatspot. Some owners, like those at the long-standing Cathay Imports a couple of doors away from Flatspot, are simply retiring. A few are moving to the suburban Asian shopping centres. Others are just going out of business.
The Chinatown vacancy rate is not a problem of high prices, according to broker Jordan Eng. Chinatown lease rates, at $15-to-$30 a square foot, are the cheapest in town, about a tenth of the asking price on Robson.
But for the steadfast opponents of gentrification, the question isn't just whether Chinatown's identity will be affected, it's what the impact these businesses will have on the public space, rental apartments and businesses that the neighbourhood's poor people use.
"I would encourage these people setting up businesses to see their social role as gentrifiers," said Ivan Drury, an activist currently working with the Carnegie Community Action Project. He and his group have approached the new crop of store owners to tell them that. In one case, they protested outside the Columbia stores - two groups of young Vancouverites whom many would see as identical, but with differing values.
Mr. Drury said the city's current Chinatown plan, along with its incentives to restore shopfronts and encourage new businesses, are all aimed at bringing in the kind of young, first-time entrepreneurs who will make higher-income people feel comfortable coming into the area.
He'd like to see the city offer incentives to keep the old, working-class shops and restaurants open.
Andy Yan, an urban analyst working with Bing Thom Architects, says the conflicts are part of the changing economics of cities.
"There's an increased polarization."
The kinds of businesses that used to cater to working- and middle-class Vancouverites in Chinatown have moved to the suburbs or disappeared, as city residents have either become much poorer or much richer.
The poor can't afford the old diners, while the well off often prefer to eat at Bao Bei instead of Vic's - the diner across from the old police headquarters, frequently featured in the TV series DaVinci's Inquest , that was turned into a Waves coffee shop a couple of years ago.
"It's reflective," said Mr. Yan, "of the larger transition of the whole city."

Full text:   Thirty-five years after founding the notorious - and notoriously political - band D.O.A., Joe Keithley is hanging up his guitar and hoping to snag the NDP nomination in a suburban Vancouver riding. Marsha Lederman reports on a wannabe MLA whose stage name is unprintable and whose onstage antics have long involved distinctly unparliamentary behaviour
Too poor to actually buy magazines, the young, scruffy members of Vancouver punk group D.O.A. used to bring notepads to record stores and jot down potential industry contacts from the back pages of trade publications. That's how, shortly after the band formed in 1978, they got the name and address of a college station in San Francisco to which they sent their first single. A month later, Disco Sucks was the station's No. 1 track.
Riding on the strength of that unexpected success, Joe Keithley, the band's founder - and its only continuous member to this day - called up a San Francisco club, hunting down a gig. "Hey, we're D.O.A. We're No. 1," he recalls telling the club's bewildered manager, who did some checking around, confirmed the information, and booked them for two shows. Although money was scarce, the four members managed to make their way to San Francisco - one by train, two by Greyhound, and one by hitchhiking. Their first night onstage, sensing the audience was bored, and needing to go to the bathroom fairly urgently, Keithley took it upon himself to urinate. "I unzipped and sent forth a stream that went clear across the dance floor," he writes in Talk - Action = 0: An Illustrated History of D.O.A. "The yellow liquid ended up in some girl's drink about 20 feet away."
D.O.A. had instant punk cred.
Indeed, it was a huge moment not just for the band, but for the Vancouver punk movement: D.O.A. would go on to become ambassadors - perhaps honkin' quadraphonic speakers would be a more apt term - for the local scene.
They toured relentlessly and got word out that there was something happening here - and it wasn't hippie folk stuff, it wasn't rock 'n' roll.
"They were the first band to introduce the punk scene or any other artists from Vancouver to the rest of the world," says Susanne Tabata, who documented Vancouver punk history in her 2010 film, Bloodied But Unbowed , which is still touring the festival circuit internationally. "They really, really did open the door and crack the ice for the Canadian bands who followed."
Soon, however, DOA will take its final bow - at least for now - as Keithley prepares for what he hopes will be a political career: In anticipation of the spring provincial election, he is going after the NDP nomination in the suburban riding of Coquitlam-Burke Mountain. Next week, D.O.A. kicks off a farewell tour with a show at Vancouver's Rickshaw Theatre, followed by dates elsewhere in B.C., in Alberta and in California.
Politics might seem like a departure for the guy who, back when he was known as Joey Shithead, thought nothing of not only urinating on but tackling inattentive audience members. Yet, looking at D.O.A.'s history, it also seems a natural extension of the political outrage that has always been so central to the band's ethos. From the beginning, they spoke out on issues such as racism and nuclear arms, and raised money for everything from rape relief to the local food bank.
Like many Canadian kids, Keithley, who grew up in Burnaby, started out wanting to be a hockey player. That all changed in Grade 10 when he attended a Greenpeace demonstration against the arms race. There was a new left wing in his life: Suddenly, he wanted to be a civil-rights lawyer. Three years later, in 1976, when he first learned about punk rock, he saw an opportunity to marry his love of music with his social concerns.
"I've been a student of politics since I was 14, 15, 16," Keithley said in an interview this week. "We realized what was happening with right-wing parties in Europe and Canada and the United States ... with people like Ronald Reagan and Margaret Thatcher. These were really right-wing people running the government, running society, that had really no interest in helping anybody except their rich friends. And we took a stand against that."
Keithley, amazingly, has been at it for some 35 years, never letting up, keeping the band going in one incarnation or another. A consummate self-promoter, he started off making business cards out of construction paper, and drove around town, using a Sharpie to add his band's name to tacked-up concert posters.
Eventually, he started his own label. At 56, with 14 studio albums and thousands of live shows under his studded belt, Keithley is living history: the embodiment of a scene that grew to be legendary.
That Vancouver should have given birth to such a thriving movement seems at odds with what the city was in the 1970s: a sleepy provincial town geographically cut off from the important cultural centres where record labels had head offices. But that isolation is credited with contributing to the scene's growth. "The bands ... in New York and Toronto and L.A. would tailor, a little bit, what they did to try to get a record deal, but there was no chance of getting one, being in Vancouver ... and that made people just go and take chances, because there was no chance you'd get successful," says Keithley.
What's considered Vancouver's first official punk concert took place at the Japanese Hall on July 30, 1977. The Dishrags, an all-female teenage act from Victoria, opened for the Furies.
"It was packed full with the news media everywhere," recalls Malcolm Hasman, who played bass for the Furies, and now lives a decidedly un-punk-rock life as a successful real-estate agent marketing luxury properties in Metro Vancouver. "That same night in Vancouver, Emerson, Lake & Palmer ... had sold out the Pacific Coliseum with 15,000 people, yet in the Vancouver Sun the next day, we were the big story."
Just a month earlier, D.O.A.'s predecessor, the Skulls, had formed and played their first show at a beach band shell in suburban White Rock. The audience, as Keithley recalls, was made up of "rock 'n' roll greaseballs" in Jack Daniel's T-shirts; people hurled food at the band. The next morning, Keithley called up The Georgia Straight newspaper and told a music writer that his band had started a riot on the beach. Opening up the Straight later that week, he was thrilled to see D.O.A. called Vancouver's most-hated rock band.
They were on their way.
After playing one of those early punk shows at the Japanese Hall, the Skulls would soon split up, and Keithley formed D.O.A. in early 1978. Knowing they'd never get a record deal, D.O.A. went D.I.Y. The members cashed their unemployment-insurance cheques and booked time at a local studio. In nine hours, they recorded the four-song EP Disco Sucks , which the band distributed around town themselves.
In the early days, many of D.O.A.'s big moments were political. They headlined an Anarchy in Canada concert in Stanley Park on Canada Day, 1978, which the police tried to shut down. The following year - during which the band opened for the Clash at the PNE - they were invited to play the Rock Against Racism concert in Chicago's Lincoln Park. Back in Vancouver, they helped organize a Rock Against Radiation concert (police once again tried to squelch it) and played another one the following year at Toronto's Nathan Phillips Square.
D.O.A. took aim at politicians themselves, too. An early concert poster for a Victoria show featured a caricature of federal Conservative MP (and, briefly, prime minister) Joe Clark with "Joe Shithead?" printed underneath in bold letters. In 1980, D.O.A. played a protest show in Detroit that coincided with the Republican National Convention.
A riot broke out when Reagan supporters approached the park in which the anti-Republic concert was being held, and police moved in. On their manager's advice, D.O.A. launched into the song Fucked Up Ronnie and then took off.
Eventually, the scene ran its course, peaking around the turn of the decade. The final nail in the coffin, according to Tabata, was likely the fallout from the political activism of the group that came to be known as the Squamish Five. Arrested in early 1983 in connection with a series of bombings, the group's members included Subhumans bassist Gerry Hannah, who ultimately went to prison for his role in the Squamish Five's activities. D.O.A. recorded a single, Right To Be Wild , to help raise money for their legal defence. It was, in general, a politically galvanizing year in B.C., which came close to a general strike, and D.O.A. released a benefit single called, you guessed it, General Strike . "At that moment, I think we became British Columbia's official protest band," Keithley writes in the book.
Over the years, D.O.A. has kept at it, Keithley and various incarnations of the band continuing to record and tour, not winding it down until now.
How long the band will be out of commission will depend on the political fortunes of Keithley, who has run twice unsuccessfully for the serially unvictorious Green Party, and may be facing another uphill challenge in Coquitlam-Burke Mountain, which is currently held by the Liberals.
Among the three other challengers for the NDP nomination, to be decided March 3, is a popular former city counsellor, NDP stalwart Barrie Lynch. But Keithley, who figures he has knocked on about 2,000 doors over two months looking for support in the riding, says he has signed up many residents, and that they were receptive to his take on issues he has long been been putting into the spotlight.
"When we started out, we thought the world was filled with warmongers, greed, sexism and racism," Keithley says. "And a lot of things haven't changed. When I think about it, that's really why I've carried on this long. There are wrongs there that still need to be righted."
