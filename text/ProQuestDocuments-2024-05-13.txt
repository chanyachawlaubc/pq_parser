Full text: BEHIND THE ADVICE Julia Chung, co-founder and chief executive officer of Vancouver-based Spring Planning Inc. and president of the Financial Planning Association of Canada, talks about growing up with hippie parents, surviving as a single teenage mom, and her drive to seek out career opportunities continuously both in and outside of the financial services sector.
What was your first money lesson?
When my older brother and I were toddlers, our mother bought us this little cardboard book for kids that explained how a bank works. It also had a piggy bank at the back. That’s my first memory of learning about money. Then, when I was five years old, my mother took me to the local credit union and helped me open a bank account. She did the same thing with my brother when he turned five. She talked about saving money and what to do with it, whether spending it on something frivolous or donating it to local charities.
My mom was adamant about us developing financial skills from a young age. It was a thread throughout our lives.
What was your experience with money growing up?
My parents were immigrants. My mom came to Canada from the U.K. when she was 11 and my dad came from Hong Kong when he was 20. Both were from well-off families, but when they met in Calgary and got married six months later, they wanted to be financially independent and build a life and family on their own. They were also hippies and wanted to be ‘real Canadians,’ so they moved to Whitehorse, learned to hunt and fish, and found work to pay the bills. That’s where my brother and I were born. When I was 3, my parents decided the Yukon was too cold and moved the family to Halfmoon Bay on B.C.’s Sunshine Coast.
We experienced a few negative financial events along the way; my dad’s business went under, my parents declared bankruptcy and we lost our house. Still, my mom and dad were determined to find their way without financial help from their parents. That became a constant in our lives: to be financially savvy and independent, especially for my mom after my dad returned to Hong Kong when I was seven. My parents then divorced when I was 10 and my mom moved us to the Lower Mainland. At the dinner table, we would talk about the importance of having a strong work ethic and discuss different monetary systems around the world.
It was expected that my brother and I would have part-time jobs while going to school. There were also specific rules around what was appropriate for us to pay for once we started earning our own money.
What past events were most influential in shaping your life today?
When I was 19, my mom died and I had my first, and only, child – all in the same week.
I was a single parent with no family nearby. I learned a lot of things at once – and quickly, including how estates work and how to survive as a single mom. I did a lot of careful juggling of finances to ensure my son had enough food, a roof over our heads and child care. I decided to work not long after having my son instead of staying home and collecting government benefits. I sacrificed spending more time with him as a baby to build a career that could support us better in the long run.
What’s your biggest money mistake – and what did you learn from it?
Getting married without a prenuptial agreement. I was married for about 10 years and then got divorced. It’s a lifechanging event that can be financially detrimental. When you get married, especially when you’re young, you think you’ll be together forever and are on the same page. But there are so many things that you don’t know about the other person, including how they’ll grow and change.
What decisions have helped drive your career success so far?
A willingness to take opportunities as they come. The expectation for the kind of life I would live as a single teenage mom wasn’t good, but I never paid attention to what others thought. I always looked around, saw and took opportunities to do things I liked and was interested in. I am an entrepreneur, like my dad. While building my career in the financial services industry, I also helped start and run a few small businesses on the side, including a concert promotion company, a coffee business and a virtual assistant company. I have also worked as a copywriter, business and technical editor, and ghostwriter. Some of these worked out, some didn’t, but they all helped get me where I am today, which includes running my own successful financial planning business.

Full text: ‘It’s the gift that keeps on giving,” says Frank Ostini, proprietor of The Hitching Post II, the restaurant made famous in Alexander Payne’s 2004 film Sideways. Twenty years after the release of the Academy Award-winner (for Best Adapted Screenplay), the story of two friends touring Santa Barbara wine country continues to draw attention to the region and one of its staple grapes, pinot noir. “There’s no amount of money, no ad campaign that could have created this kind of publicity,” Ostini says. “All these new people have come in and challenged us to get better.”
Filmed on location in California’s Buellton, Solvang and the Santa Ynez Valley, the road-trip movie featuring actors Paul Giamatti, Thomas Haden Church, Virginia Madsen and Sandra Oh captured the sunshiny beauty of the region, beaming bucolic vineyards and quaint villages into cineplexes and TV screens around the world. A so-called “Sideways effect” followed, as sales of pinot noir skyrocketed by 300 per cent in the decade after the film’s release. Some winemakers accused the film of souring the reputation of Californian merlot, but that grape’s commercial success was already falling off a cliff before the film’s pinot-loving protagonist Miles insists: “If anyone orders merlot, I’m leaving.”
In hindsight, the real Sideways effect was creating awareness of California winemaking regions beyond Napa and Sonoma and spearheading a growth in wine tourism throughout the Golden State – and around the world. It made wine touring a focus of weekend escapes and full vacations, which helped to increase wine consumption in North America and paved the way for smaller estate winemakers.
Richard Sanford was one of the first to see the vinous potential of Santa Barbara’s windswept hills, which are cooled by fog blowing in almost daily off the Pacific. He established the 120-acre Sanford & Benedict Vineyard in 1971 and set his sights on producing top quality pinot noir in the region. By the mid-1980s, the area was home to acclaimed wineries, such as Au Bon Climat, Babcock Winery & Vineyards and Sanford Winery, which is where Miles shares winetasting tips with his friend Jack (“Stick your nose in it.
Don’t be shy; really get your nose in there.”) in the film. “It was brilliant because after the movie premiered, these places existed,” Sanford says.
“People were able to come and visit.” Santa Barbara’s Visitors Center offers a free, self-guided Sideways trail map, listing 18 wineries, restaurants and attractions featured in the film. The Days Inn in Buellton, which was called The Windmill in the movie, rebranded itself as The Sideways Inn. Dining options, The Hitching Post II and Los Olivos Wine Merchant and Café, continue to welcome fans of the film.
Visitors attracted to the region located two hours northwest of Los Angeles are also able to find many more new discoveries. Home to roughly 50 wine producers in 2000, the Santa Ynez Valley viticultural area now features more than 200 wineries and tasting rooms that produce 360 million litres of wine. Pinot noir continues to be its strong suit, but vineyards are planted with 60 different grape varieties.
It’s worth noting that the growth of the wine industry hasn’t spoiled the area’s relaxed beauty.
Unlike Napa where the value of the grape crop saw local farmers transition exclusively to wine growing, Santa Barbara’s vineyards continue to share space with walnut trees, strawberry fields and other agricultural ventures.
Its culinary scene continues to flourish as well.
Wine savvy visitors created demand for higherend restaurants, as well as a greater appreciation and use of local ingredients. One of the most hotly anticipated culinary developments is the launch of a partnership between Thomas Keller and Ty Warner Hotels and Resorts. The renowned French Laundry and Per Se chef will oversee food operations at Coral Casino Beach and Cabana Club, including the Four Seasons Resort the Biltmore Santa Barbara, which will reopen after four years of renovations later this year.

Georian revival: Bath is known for its luminous cityscape. Today, it’s the backdrop for a growing list of design-obsessed entrepreneurs

Full text: Bath, the UNESCO World Heritage Site in southwest England’s Somerset countryside, is named for its top tourist attraction.
The city was founded in the first century by the Romans, who used its natural hot springs as a thermal spa. But a dip in those steaming waters, in an elaborately engineered underground temple dedicated to Minerva, goddess of healing, is off limits to visitors who wander through the historic site today.
At the Cleveland Pools, however, you can once again take the plunge. This equally impressive water complex was built in 1815 and continuously used for bathing until 1984.
Following a nearly £10-million restoration, the complex, believed to be the oldest surviving outdoor public swimming pool in the United Kingdom, reopened to the public in the fall.
Its main attraction is a large curvilinear pool, originally reserved for male bathers who had been banned from swimming nude in the adjacent river.
Cleveland Pools can only be reached on foot through the scenic trails of a quiet residential cul-de-sac, which contributes to its somewhat secret status. Travelling there takes you through layers of Saxon, medieval and Tudor architecture, and most notably, neoclassical Palladian buildings constructed during the 18th century under the reign of George III. Accented with honey-coloured limestone pediments and Corinthian pilasters, these landmarks give the city its distinctive glow, even in the pouring rain.
The direct 90-minute train from London Paddington means that Bath, population 100,000, sees a significant influx of visitors, particularly for weekend getaways. Many of those tourists come to town to experience the waters and the historic cityscape, to follow in the literary footsteps of Mary Shelley (who wrote much of her landmark gothic Frankenstein while attending lectures in town) and Jane Austen (who lived here, briefly), and to hop between filming locations of Netflix’s blockbuster Regency-era series Bridgerton. Lately, the city is also becoming a destination for fans of a branch of contemporary British design that’s anchored in history.
Bath’s influx of weekenders also includes more than a few hen and stag parties, which is why, during my visit in October, I opted to stay in Bathwick. It’s a quiet area on the opposite bank of the River Avon and only a 10-minute stroll across neoclassical Pulteney Bridge from the bustling city centre. I enjoyed coming and going along Great Pulteney Street, a wide formal avenue flanked by the unspoiled Georgian architecture of luxurious terraced townhouses.
At its east end is the Holburne Museum.
Doubling as the stately residence of Bridgerton’s formidable Lady Danbury, in real life it’s the onetime home of Sir Thomas Holburne, a lifelong collector of quirky miniatures, old masters and objets d’art he later bequeathed to the city. A recent exhibition was devoted to painter Gwen John, whose reputation only emerged out the imposing shadow of her artist brother Augustus and lover Auguste Rodin after her death in 1939.
Great Pulteney Street is only one of the city’s architectural set pieces. The Circus, a round residential street of townhouses from 1754, is another masterpiece of graceful urban planning.
Its streetscape overflows ornamentation in the forms of friezes, decorative emblems and triglyphs. The curving Palladian façades of nearby Royal Crescent overlook the vast Royal Victoria Park lawn. Among them, No. 1 is the city’s most prestigious address, housing a museum styled entirely in the Georgian manner (and doubling as another Bridgerton backdrop, the Featherington family’s abode).
The Assembly Rooms, referenced by Austen, was one of the legendary dance halls at the heart of aristocratic socializing in her day, and it still drips with crystal chandeliers and ornate mouldings. During a visit, you can practically hear the gossiping ghosts of socialites past. At the nearby Jane Austen Centre, those ghosts are, in fact, real-life guides costumed in Regency garb, who lead tours in character.
All this history – and occasional kitsch – forms the groundwork for the contemporary designers, galleries and quirky shops that draw on the city’s heritage values. Nowhere is this more in evidence than at the influential design boutique Berdoulat. Based in Margaret’s Buildings, a historic pedestrian street lined with independent design shops, Berdoulat is Patrick Williams’s architectural practice, which specializes in period building restoration. It’s also the three-storey Georgian shopfront he co-founded with his wife, Turkish and Bulgarian photographer Neri Williams.
The wood countertops, brass scales and antique apothecary jars are heirlooms, just as Berdoulat’s many tableware and interior accessory collaborations with local artisans will eventually become. From cutlery baskets by Bath’s Willow pottery to canelé-shaped ceiling fixtures by Devon ceramicist Feldspar, all its pieces are designed in collaboration with regional makers. The simple refectory tables, lipped bowls and oak egg racks highlight craft and epitomize beautility, the latest buzzword for functional home essentials in modest materials.
As someone who thrills at the archaic terminology of estate interiors – think “boot rooms,” “butler’s pantries” and anything featuring the word “scullery” – the new deVOL Kitchens showroom tucked in the corner of a historic building block nearby is a twofold pleasure. The firm specializes in (and popularized) handmade kitchen furniture inspired by historic home aesthetics that fuse classic unfitted Georgian and farmhouse styles with modern conveniences. The copper worktops, Shaker wainscotting, aged brass taps, slatted plate racks and fluted marble bib sinks of the three atmospheric showroom kitchens are swoon-worthy – and could easily have been plucked out of any of the high-ceilinged townhouses on the street.
Niche bookshop and publisher Persephone Books sits next door in the Edgar Buildings. It was established 25 years ago to excavate a more recent history: neglected works (mostly by women) from the mid-20th century. As much as I adore Austen, Persephone is the reason I’ve come to Bath: a pilgrimage to the bookshop that has unearthed so many of my favourite reads.
The publisher’s attention to design detail rivals that of its neighbours. The vestibule and fixtures are done up in the same signature dove grey as its books, each with individual endpapers reproducing period textiles and wallpapers chosen to complement the material. A period upholstery fabric, for example, lines an edition of the once-forgotten 1938 charmer Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day by Winifred Watson that is Persephone’s perennial bestseller.
Among the cluster of well-curated art and antique shops up the hill, Francis Gallery is set inside another of these heritage-listed Georgian townhouses, with wood furnishings and plinths in tonal shades of ecru arranged like a living space. Korean-Canadian founder and director Rosa Park grew up in Vancouver. Prior to opening the gallery (which also has an outpost in Los Angeles) to present the work of emerging international artists, she created Cereal, an acclaimed indie magazine about travel and lifestyle. The space is as warm and understated as her magazine pages, with diffused lighting like something out of a Hammershøi painting adding to the moodiness of the ghostly Krista Mezzadri monotype prints on show when I visited.
Retracing my steps to explore an area around the railway station, I took the invigorating waters of a different kind at Bath Botanical Gin Distillery & Herbal Apothecary, the passion project of medical herbalist Sue Mullett. As a one-woman operation, its hours are limited, but I stopped by at just the right time to sample the micro-distillery’s offerings of boozy, small-batch tonics inspired by traditional apothecary tinctures. Mullett’s crisply refreshing No.1 Gin is the only authentically Bath-produced gin, and every wax-sealed bottle comes out of the copper still that is the petite room’s centrepiece. It is yet another example of how Bath’s modern sense of craft and culture flourishes because of the reverence for the city’s history.

Concord Pacific, Vancouver take halting steps toward Expo lands redevelopment: The new waterfront neighbourhood would include non-market housing as part of deal

Full text: The City of Vancouver and developer Concord Pacific have finally formalized a deal to transfer three Concordowned sites to the city for nonmarket housing. While the deal on affordable housing is welcome, whether it’s a step closer to the long-anticipated development of a new waterfront neighbourhood on the north side of False Creek is a question that lingers.
“We’re raring to go and get to Northeast False Creek, and our final piece of the Expo lands is to get it rezoned and get it under construction,” said Matt Meehan, senior vice-president of planning for Concord Pacific Development Corp.
There is one major sticking point, which is the removal of the Georgia and Dunsmuir Street viaducts. The city approved the Northeast False Creek plan in 2018, estimating the cost of the viaduct removal and construction of a new road system at $438million. That cost is expected to have increased over the last six years.
To fund the project, the city had been counting on significant community amenity contributions (CACs) from developers who own land in the area. Developers pay CACs when they apply for rezonings, and they are typically used for parks, daycares and other public facilities.
The Northeast False Creek (NEFC) plan includes a sea of highrises, mostly condos, as well as some market rental and nonmarket housing. Construction delays amid a housing crisis, in addition to the failure to deliver promised park land, have raised the ire of local residents.
It’s still unclear when construction of the new neighbourhood and road network will begin. The city’s plan depends on sales or leases of city lands no longer needed for the viaducts, and developer contributions in the form of cash and land. But in 2018, the market was hot compared to today’s market and condos aren’t selling like they used to.
Concord said its development plans now hinge on the removal of the viaducts. The NEFC plan can’t go ahead without them coming down. Meanwhile, the city is waiting for more funding.
“We’re kind of in a predicament where we can’t really go ahead with our plans until the viaducts are actually in the process of coming down,” Mr. Meehan said. He points out that the city has already received an infusion of funding, including $110-million from his company and a substantial amount from the rezoning of Plaza of Nations in 2018, which resulted in a major boost in density for that developer, Canadian Metropolitan Properties.
“Between the $110-million from Concord’s rezoning and the $100-million from the Plaza of Nations rezoning, the city has made a giant step toward the cost of the removal of the viaducts,” Mr. Meehan said. “With the [Lions Gate and Granville] bridges having been recently seismically upgraded, we understand there is urgency in the demolition of the viaducts, as well as in planning for the area.
“The timeline for development depends not only on viaduct removal, but also on planning cooperation, financing, and market conditions. We can’t speak for all the other NEFC landowners, but we are ready to move ahead.”
Concord Pacific and Canadian Metropolitan Properties are landowners of the key waterfront sites. Aquilini Development, crown corporation PavCo (BC Place) and the city of Vancouver are also landowners in the area.
Canadian Metropolitan’s Plaza of Nations site, valued a couple of years ago at $800-million, doesn’t need the viaduct removal to begin construction of its 10-acre master-planned community, says James Cheng, architect for the rezoning application.
“However, as a Vancouverite, I think the removal of the viaducts is a good thing for the city as the viaducts cut the city into east and west,” said Mr. Cheng. “With their removal, it will be more of a seamless transition uniting two neighbourhoods.
“The other important aspect of removing the viaducts is to provide a proper termination to Georgia Street, which is one of the two ceremonial streets of Vancouver – the other is Burrard.
Currently, there is no end to Georgia as it just turned into a freeway. With the viaducts gone, it will dip down and connect to Pacific Boulevard, providing a much-needed pedestrian and vehicular connection.”
The city could not give a timeline for the viaducts project, which staff have said would take a couple of years once finally under way. The city said that it still needs funding from surrounding development sites to complete the two-phase work. Once funding is secured, the city will finalize the design and prepare an updated cost estimate for the project.
“Funding from the redevelopment of sites within the Plan area, secured through rezoning, is needed to contribute to the cost of removing the viaducts and implementing the new street network,” the city responded in an e-mail. “In addition, the city requires some privately-owned land to deliver the replacement street network. This land is intended to be secured through the rezoning processes for the development sites in the area.
“Once sufficient funding is secured through the rezoning processes (and other sources as necessary), the viaducts can be removed, and Concord can proceed with redevelopment of their site in tandem with the implementation of the new street network.”
The city spokesperson conceded that “these projects have not progressed as quickly as envisaged when the [Northeast False Creek] plan was adopted in 2018.”
However, the city and park board “remain committed to realizing the plan,” the statement said.
The city’s announcement about non-market housing last week was a small sign of progress.
They had officially given up the option to purchase three of the six Concord sites originally designated for non-market housing, in exchange for $121-million from the developer and other benefits.
Of that amount, the city said $110million is earmarked to go toward the street network and viaduct removal. The remaining $11-million represents what the city would have had to pay the developer if it had optioned its right to purchase the three sites for nonmarket housing. Concord waived the amount.
Instead of developing all six sites, as planned, the city will increase the density and deliver 670 units at 990 Beatty St., 1050 Expo Blvd. and 450 Pacific Blvd.
The biggest projects are the 28and 29-storey towers on Beatty Street and Expo Boulevard, respectively. And Concord will be allowed to develop condominiums on the other three sites, at 1502 Granville St., 431 Beach Cres.
and 900 Pacific Blvd.
The deal goes back to the late eighties, shortly after Concord Pacific purchased the Expo Lands and the city came up with a goal for 20 per cent of the site to be affordable housing. Several of the sites have since been converted to market condo development.
The lack of senior government funding has made the city’s delivery of non-market housing a challenge.
Former City of Burnaby senior planner Robert Renger said he believed Concord got the better deal in this recent land transfer. If the city had held onto all six sites, they could have delivered even more non-market housing, Mr. Renger said. He also notes that the money Concord paid to the city that will go toward the viaduct removal benefits the developer as much as the city.
“The city and province could have – and should have – gone ahead with the acquisition and development of these three sites just as they are doing, without giving up the other three nonmarket sites to Concord for market development.
“Shortage of affordable housing is at crisis levels,” he said. “It doesn’t make sense to give up non-market housing sites at this time, just to raise money for viaduct removal.”

Canmore struggles to build more rental stock: High rental costs in the town have driven up housing costs that have become untenable for local workers

Full text: Last November, after a fouryear stint renting in Canmore, Alta. Dylan Stewart and his partner, a health care worker, decided to move 80 kilometres east, to Cochrane.
“It’s quite a crazy [rental] market, even in Cochrane,” Mr. Stewart says. “But we found something there that suited our incomes better.”
As much as they enjoyed living in close proximity to the Rocky Mountains, the couple found their situation untenable in Canmore, as they weren’t willing to spend more than 40 per cent of their income on rent to stay in a town where the cost of living is well above the rest of the province.
“The first year, our landlord didn’t raise our rent,” Mr. Stewart says about their last rental. “But the second year she wanted to raise it over 20 per cent – we were already paying $2,150 a month.”
This situation is not out of the ordinary.
Between 2019 and 2023, the median rental rate in Canmore jumped by 20 per cent, from $1,525 to $1,836, according to CMHC data.
Insufficient supply relative to demand seems to be the culprit, but a number of barriers have kept developers and builders from scaling up Canmore’s rental stock.
“We need to unlock more supply by getting out of the way and making the process more efficient, and more functional,” says Ian O’Donnell, executive director of the Bow Valley Builders and Developers Association. “Maybe then we would encourage more people to come in and build more product.”
In 2021, the number of households in Canmore reached 6,775, a third of which are renters. However, only 5 per cent of all dwellings are purpose-built rentals.
One of the reasons construction in this segment has lagged behind is the risk associated with the high cost of land in a privileged location.
“Here in the Bow Valley, when developers look at the opportunity for a parcel, they want to maximize their return of investment,” Mr. O’Donnell says. Because returns in rental investment tend to be slow, capital often flows toward condominiums and recreational properties instead.
“Those types of products have been incredibly popular, especially tourist homes, over the last 15 years or so,” Mr. O’Donnell says. “That product really shifted the dynamics where you could get your capital in and out very quickly, and that product also allowed a great flexibility of use by the new owners.”
However, catering to tourists and part-time residents has come at the expense of local workers. To change this, Mr. O’Donnell suggests the town should facilitate the development of underutilized land in the town’s centre, and expedite the permitting process for multifamily buildings.
“Land sales can be $4-[million] or $5-million an acre, which is very expensive to develop in,” he says, noting that height and density relaxations are essential to ensure the viability of any multifamily project, and application delays add to the cost of a project.
“When you’re looking at financing, when you’re looking at interest rates, the longer this takes, the more costly it is.”
Since 2017, the Town of Canmore has been making efforts to incentivize the construction of purpose built rentals, including the sale of a parcel at a discounted price, and granting a 75-percent reduction in municipal property taxes to projects committed to remaining as rental properties for at least a decade, an initiative council plans to expand further.
While these initiatives have quadrupled the number of rental units in the primary market, the new supply has proven insufficient to meet the needs of local workers.
For Luis Hernández, a chef, finding a rental for him and his family required a significant compromise.
The Hernándezes are not only paying roughly half of their monthly income in rent, they’ve also turned their apartment’s living room into sleeping quarters, because each of their two children, a boy and a girl in their early teens, requires a bedroom of their own.
“Ideally, we wanted a threebedroom apartment,” Mr. Hernández says, adding that their search for an apartment extended for over three months. “But we only found a two-bedroom available within our $3,000 budget.”
Had his budget been more ample, finding a suitable place would have been easier. “There’s houses renting for $4,500, $5,000,” Mr. Hernández says.
“That’s a ridiculous amount of money to spend in rent alone.”
Like Mr. Hernández, many hospitality and retail workers in the Bow Valley live in precarious conditions, as the chasm between incomes and rental rates widens.
“Since the pandemic, people have really wanted to move to mountain resort locations,” says Kristopher Mathieu, acting executive director at Canmore Community Housing, an arm’s length agency of the Town of Canmore, noting that the most affected by this trend are local workers.
“Those are the people that are, unfortunately, being squeezed out of the market.”
The crunch is most evident in the organization’s waiting list to rent one of their 116 below-market units, which has swelled from 28 households in 2019, to 270 in April, 2024.
“The couple hundred units that have come online in the last decade is a small drop in the bucket for what’s truly needed here,” Mr. Mathieu says. “So any purpose-built rental development is a good thing to pull away at this, but the volume needs to quadruple, and then some.”
To meet the projected need of 2,500 homes by 2030, last year the Town of Canmore created a housing action plan that includes initiatives to curb the proliferation of recreational homes, and to facilitate the construction of purpose-built rentals.
“Canmore needs more development and housing in a variety of places on the housing spectrum, otherwise the prices get even further out of reach,” says Canmore Mayor Sean Krausert.
However, because homes in the resale market are out of reach for a majority of the town’s workers, “we need to increase the product that they have the ability to afford, whether that be rental or ownership.”
For this reason, the town is working on an ambitious plan to build 1,300 homes over the next two decades in Palliser Trail, a 23hectare development on publicly owned land where at least 75 per cent of the units created are anticipated to be non-market.
“To solve our housing crisis, it doesn’t just take any housing,” Mr. Krausert says. “It takes nonmarket housing.”
Despite recent setbacks, including the refusal of the town’s Housing Accelerator Fund application by the federal government, the first phase of this development, 100 Palliser Lane, a 144-unit non-market rental building, could break ground as early as August.
“Had we received the Housing Accelerator Fund, some things might have been easier and quicker,” Mr. Krausert says. “But we’re still committed to implementing our plans.”
In the meantime, the town has also requested the Alberta government for an exemption in municipal debt limits, so Canmore Community Housing can expand its non-market stock faster.
“While we certainly welcome a variety of housing, the vast majority of the housing that will be constructed by the development community won’t solve our housing crisis,” Mr. Krausert says.
“It will be just too expensive.”

Full text: INSIDE THE MARKET Mark down June 5 as the date everything changes for interest rates.
It’s not a certainty that the Bank of Canada will lower its trendsetting overnight rate on that date, but weak economic numbers make it very likely.
Rates on floating rate debt such as credit lines and variablerate mortgages would immediately fall, and so would a variety of rates for savers and investors.
For now, though, people with money to save or invest can benefit from a last gasp of high rates.
Online bank Tangerine is offering 5 per cent for guaranteed investment certificates with terms of three, four and five years.
If you prefer a guaranteed 5 per cent over what stocks and bonds may provide, don’t delay.
The financial market forces that helped produce this offer from Tangerine are already receding.
Tangerine’s current GIC rate structure attests to the weirdness of the interest-rate landscape today.
A one-year term pays 5.2 per cent, which is quite competitive.
Two years gets you 3.6 per cent, which is lame in comparison to the 5 per cent or more available from several alternative banks.
The 5-per-cent return for terms of three through five years is top of the market by a fair margin unless you deal with a GIC broker. Note: The best rates available through GIC brokers may require a high minimum investment.
GIC rates are influenced in part by interest rates in the bond market, which lurched higher in late April because of concerns about inflation.
Bond yields have come back down a bit recently, which means there’s little impetus for GIC issuers to up their rates right now unless they have a specific agenda like attracting money for mortgage lending.
Even there, the rationale for higher GIC rates is uncertain.
Some local real estate markets are thriving, others less so.
The theory is that some buyers are waiting for lower mortgage rates, a development that could actually harm affordability by spurring demand and pushing prices higher.
Stocks have been strong lately and, over a five-year period, could very well outperform a 5 per cent GIC.
But if you adjust for stock market risk, 5 per cent may look appealing. This is especially true in a tax-free savings account, where you sidestep the reality that GIC interest is taxed like regular income.
A drop in the Bank of Canada’s overnight rate does not mean automatic cuts in GIC rates.
But a lower overnight rate sends a strong signal that we will finally see at least a partial unwinding of the big rate hikes of 2022-23. It could be a long time until 5 per cent GICs come around again.

A space that’s inviting and clean – and 167 years old: East Flamborough Township Hall has been restored by owners and brothers Andrew, Nathan, and Nick Brown and their spouses

Full text: If one can avert their eyes from the tall, majestic, arched window about seven or eight feet away, the photograph applied to the office window is fascinating: On the far left is the former Union Cemetery (now Waterdown Cemetery) up on Vinegar Hill; then, the John and Ada Vance house on Board Street, which became the CPR’s Waterdown South station (destroyed by fire in 1966); moving to the right, it’s the old Dundas Street bridge over Grindstone Creek; and, finally, the 1870 Eager house, which the family owned for three generations.
Walk inside that glass-walled office to that tall window, look out, and the Eager house is about all that can be spotted almost 125 years later in Waterdown, a village about 10 kilometres north of Hamilton. But the building where the office is located, the former East Flamborough Township Hall (known to many locals as the local public library, which occupied the building from 1979-2015), well, it now looks as good as it did on the day it opened in 1857.
That’s how good the renovation and restoration by owners and brothers Andrew, Nathan and Nick Brown and their spouses is, says heritage architecture expert Shannon Kyles: “It’s as good as anything you’re going to find in Italy, frankly.
“They’ve maintained everything that was important,” she continues, “and they’ve made the space inviting, clean, modern, but old.”
On Saturday and Sunday, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., 25 Mill St. N., which now houses the two Brown businesses, Brown Lawyers and Brown Financial Security, will be open to the general public for the first time for Hamilton Region’s annual Doors Open event.
Not that that has stopped the curious from popping by, laughs lawyer Andrew Brown: “We had people walking in just to check it out, not even clients, not even prospective clients. … We welcome it to an extent; the response and the feedback has always been overwhelmingly positive because you go from a squirrel-infested, drywalled space with [library] stacks to, ‘Oh wow, this is in our town.’ ” To be clear, the squirrels moved in when the library moved out and before the Browns purchased in 2017 for a little more than $1-million.
Speaking of which, while the building wasn’t in terrible condition (18-inch-thick limestone walls have a way of keeping things protected) the Browns did put a great deal more money – about $750,000 – as well as love, sweat, and thought into the restoration, and it shows.
On the exterior, not only have decades of soot and grime been scrubbed away, mortar joints are crisp again, and the original windows have been restored and paired with new, old-looking, wooden storms. Even better, the “institutional” front door to the library has been replaced with Hamilton-made, quarter-sawn oak doors.
“We went and visited buildings in Guelph to look at the work that had been done on a similar-aged building,” says Marianne Brown, an engineer at Orr Brown Consulting Engineers (and wife of Nick Brown), who partnered with local design firm Charles Linsey & Associates and Ira McDonald Construction Ltd.
“What would the inside look like, what would the flooring look like? There were very few interior photos of the building that existed, mostly exterior, but, as a result we rebuilt the front to replicate the original.”
Step inside the small foyer, and a visitor is treated to newly exposed stone walls, handsome tile underfoot, a very mid-century modern staircase to the second floor (they tried to save money where possible), a big boardroom with a great deal of exposed stone – electric baseboard heating is required to boost the temperature in winter – and, down the hall, another gorgeous wooden door and the 1970s elevator, which may still be haunted.
According to the Flamborough Archives & Heritage Society website, the ghost arrived in 1979, when two tombstones belonging to the first European settlers on the escarpment, Alexander Brown (1776-1852), and his wife, “Marion” Grierson (1779-1863), were installed beside the elevator of the newly renovated library.
The tombstones had been discovered the year before by a local couple strolling along Nelson Street, where ground was being prepared for new housing. That land had originally been owned by the Union Cemetery caretaker, who’d laid the stones face down to create a walkway to his outhouse. The reason? Ms. Grierson’s given name was misspelled – it was actually “Merren” – so the stones were never used. But Ms. Grierson’s ghost, angry at this memorialization, decided to periodically send the elevator on phantom journeys.
“It will still open sometimes,” Ms. Brown says with a smile.
“But I maintain, just for the comfort of our clients, that once those stones got put in the new library, Merren moved out,” Mr. Brown says.
Upstairs, where the library had placed washrooms and, incredulously, boarded up the top portion of the aforementioned arched window, there is now clean, functional office space.
And although the team uncovered a steel beam fairly close to the big window (to support the cupola after twin columns to the first floor were removed in the seventies) during renovations, they were able to create a tiny barrel vault around it before dropping the ceiling to reconceal the beam. In the main foyer space opposite, a much larger barrel vault has been created where there may have been one originally.
Interestingly, because the Browns needed more offices than there were windows, they’ve pulled them away from the exterior walls in favour of twin corridors. Adding interior glass to each office democratically doles out the sunshine and dopamine.
And speaking of happiness, a visit to the former East Flamborough Township Hall and the six other Waterdown buildings featured during Doors Open will surely make even the most casual architecture aficionado’s heart beat just a little bit faster.
DOORS OPEN
“Doors Open started in 2002, and Waterdown has never been a part of it,” says local historian Andy McLaren, who spent nine months (along with Shannon Kyles) organizing the region’s participation. In addition to the Browns’s building, there are three churches, a limestone pub called Mill St. & 5, which will celebrate its 200th anniversary this summer, and an 1860 limestone building that houses a bookstore.
In addition to Waterdown, Ancaster will feature six buildings, Stoney Creek five buildings, Dundas four buildings and Mount Hope one building. Hamilton proper will feature 25 buildings. Doors Open takes place on Saturday and Sunday, from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. More information at doorsopenontario.on.ca/ pages/events/hamilton

Sheridan College’s student union building aims to draw people in for accidental interactions: Students’ wishes came to fruition in a five-storey, metal-clad building so porous that they feel interconnected no matter how they use it

Full text: When it comes to postsecondary student union buildings, they’re usually crummy, ill-fitting hand-medowns: “Hey, SU, it’s the Faculty of X here, we just built ourselves a sexy new building, so you can have the one we deemed unfit for human habitation, okay?” Not so at Sheridan College’s Hazel McCallion Campus in Mississauga, where a big, white nonelephant of a building has sprung up where a parking lot used to be.
“We bring all the student unions here to tour,” says Jamie King, Sheridan Student Union director, “and they can’t believe what we’ve got, because some student union buildings are a little more, uh, rustic, I’ll say.”
The five-storey, metal-clad building is anything but a cabin in the woods: An almost fully glazed two-storey atrium filled with food services, a pub and other hang-out areas tucks into a small, grassy knoll while, above, three more storeys containing club meeting spaces, quiet rooms, a massive fitness facility with an indoor running track, and a large, tech-filled space suitable for lectures seem to float effortlessly above. Materials are robust yet still elegant, and there is so much porosity students feel interconnected no matter how they use the building.
“You can see it’s kind of like a jigsaw puzzle,” says architect Daniel Ling, a principal at Montgomery Sisam Architects Inc. “It’s not like one level is all lounges, one level it’s all the study spaces; we wanted to mix and match them in a way to find complementary uses so that certain spaces can have an overlap. … The idea is to create opportunity for accidental interaction.”
It’s not unlike urbanist Jane Jacobs’s theory that dense, colourful, pokey high streets cause pedestrians to linger and, in so doing, promote chance interactions between locals that eventually turn into friendships. And the more people know one another, the safer a community will be.
Except, at Sheridan, all of this Jacobification is happening indoors. That may have something to do with Mississauga’s incredibly rapid growth from Toronto bedroom community to vibrant, stand-alone city: Wide suburban roads and windswept parking lots still dominate in certain areas.
That, however, influenced the design of the building, Mr. Ling says: “This is a suburban context; there’s Cineplex across the way, Square One [shopping centre] over there, all kinds of [big-box] retail, we’ve got condos – so a lot of visual noise. When we looked at this building … we thought that it needed some quiet restraint, kind of an understated look; from the outside, you get glimpses of the programming inside, but not everything is visible, so to draw you in.”
He’s right. The building is especially magnetic at night, when the base glows, lantern-like, and light spills onto the lawn and zigzagging pathways. Even a look upward to the fourth floor rewards the eye with a peek of attractive high ceilings and a “floating” running track trimmed with LED lighting.
It’s hard not to be a moth drawn to this flame.
A flame that began, in 2016, as kindling in the form of little yellow pieces of paper, Mr. King jokes: “We started out with about a thousand sticky notes on walls, and ideas about slides from the fifth floor to the third floor and rock walls and all of this, and then we pared it back a little bit.
“And that got to a document that became, ultimately, the program,” Mr. Ling finishes. A 2010 Sheridan architectural technology graduate, Lucas Laurenssen, became project manager to ensure the students’ wishes came to fruition.
Why? Because the entire building was paid for by students – final construction cost was a very reasonable $31-million – through fees paid to the incorporated student union organization (the SSU has about 300 paid positions and is assisted by a full-time staff of 20). And while silly things such as slides didn’t make the cut, the students held strong on certain premium items, such as the wood-strip ceilings, when it was suggested that aluminum would save them considerable money.
On a walk-through with Mr. King, Mr. Ling and Will Klassen, an associate at Moriyama Teshima Architects, it’s clear the extra money was worth it. The fir ceiling not only adds warmth, it helps absorb sound, and, because it slides past the glass walls to become the soffit, it performs the classic modernist trick of dissolving the boundaries between inside and outside.
And because the space was so incredibly busy, our little group had to make use of one of the building’s quiet spaces – the club meeting space on the second floor – to get some serious architectural conversation going (Sheridan has 120 clubs, which range from a tea drinking club to the Muslim Students Association).
It’s difficult to take a building as large and multipurpose as this and find ways to make it warm and homey; it’s also no mean feat to create isolation spaces that don’t feel like prison cells, or big communal areas that don’t feel like a cacophonous shopping mall. And because of the way the mechanical system was planned, the building also had to join with an existing building – also by Montgomery Sisam/Moriyama Teshima – filled with a completely different set of requirements (classrooms) yet still look to be “of a piece.” This was achieved by the use of similar white cladding, whether that be in the form of raised mullions, shading fins or the ribbed panels between windows.
“When you get it at the right light, the shadows work with the different angles,” Mr. Klassen says. “And that’s exactly what we were hoping would happen.”
And Sheridan’s Mississauga students, who knew exactly what they needed in a big new building, got what they were hoping for as well.
“The college knows that we’ve set a standard here that they can’t ignore,” Mr. King finishes with a smile.

Full text: When developer Hesam Deihimi was thinking about what he wanted for a big development in the Vancouver suburb of Port Moody – almost 200 apartments in that city’s old downtown, incorporating a heritage building – he knew he wanted to help create a community, not just a bunch of boxes.
“I think people are longing for a sense of belonging,” says the Iran-born Mr. Deihimi, who has been interested in the topic of belonging himself since he was a child trying to figure out how he fit into Canada. There’s a reason his company is named Placemaker Communities.
So when the team he’d hired to design the project, GBL Architects Inc., came up with a plan that included a mews in the middle of the two buildings, with shops and cafés and places to gather and sit – places to connect – he was all in.
As it turned out, local residents and council felt the same way.
The proposal for Mary Ann’s Place, named after a beloved community activist, Mary Anne Cooper, who died in 2021, saw 15 people come out to support the project and a unanimous approval vote from council last September.
Mr. Deihimi’s project is an example of the growing interest from a pioneering group of Vancouver developers and architects, community activists, urban designers, psychology professors and regular residents in the possibility of designing new buildings that help promote social connection – a topic of considerable interest in a city famously known for its high reported levels of loneliness.
And it’s getting even more attention as Canadian cities, due to new policies emanating from civic, provincial and federal governments panicking about how to grapple with the country’s housing crisis, are promoting massive new density of all kinds.
Among those trying to ensure that social connection gets built into this transformation is the urban-planning group Happy Cities, which consulted for Mr. Deihemi on the Port Moody project as part of its ongoing work on researching ways to create more socially connected new housing.
Another Vancouver organization, Hey Neighbour! Collective, is also dedicated to understanding and fostering connections among tenants as a way of creating more resilient social networks. That group, co-led by Michelle Hoar, has been working with Happy Cities in recent months on holding workshops for city planners on how to incorporate more of those ideas into formal design rules and incentives.
A non-profit group, also in Vancouver, called Urbanarium which focuses on better planning and design in cities, recently ran an architecture competition that asked entrants to focus on social connection, along with green design and affordability. That produced a raft of entries that aimed to increase social interactions among both residents inside a building and in the general neighbourhood.
One of the winning entries, Tower House, by the New York firm Studio Oh Song, featured seductive outdoor courtyards with picnic tables and play areas, all accessible to the general public.
Vancouver’s Team Switch included a café and other commercial space in the ground floor of their imaginary development that had two six-storey buildings with 16 apartments on a single lot. Others proposed having meeting rooms or gyms in the apartment building that could be used by other residents in the area. Many featured outside walkways on all floors, where residents could see each other as they travelled to their front doors And, out on a new frontier that combines psychology with architecture and technology, Vancouver architect Bruce Haden, founder of FLUID Architecture, is working with TED-talk-famous University of B.C. psychology professor Elizabeth Dunn to develop a new kind of software to predict how architecture and design affect human interaction.
“We’re trying to build an evidence library,” says Mr. Haden.
He got interested in the topic almost a decade ago when he tried to design a different kind of social housing building for single mothers but couldn’t convince the funders that it was worth spending the needed 30 per cent more on exterior walls to support a design with outdoor walkways where the women would be more likely to see and subsequently socialize with each other.
“We had a hard piece of measurable data going up against a soft social intention,” he remembers ruefully. “So now we’re trying to bring some degree of evidence about sociability, like what happened with green design decades ago.”
The software he is developing, with the help of Ms. Dunn and tech specialists, aims to produce usable data to calculate how people move through the stages of connecting with neighbours – from simply encountering them, to proceeding to the “hello” phase, to forming enough of a bond that they can count on a neighbour for help. That could be anything from borrowing a tool to letting them know their pet has escaped to the street to checking up to see how they’re doing in a heat wave or power failure.
To that end, they model different kinds of designs with different “characters” (people who work outside the home, others who don’t, for example) to figure out what kinds of layouts create more of those encounters that help people gradually come to recognize familiar faces and be more inclined to start communicating.
“We’re trying to understand who are you crossing paths with,” he says.
That means looking carefully at the different types of areas in buildings where people might encounter each other: “pause spaces” – the places where people are 100-per-cent going to go as they conduct their regular lives, like garbage areas, parking, lobbies.
One scenario they modelled for a proposed Indigenous housing project on Vancouver Island showed that, under one kind of layout, the number of crossings increased more than 10 times, compared to another.
But space for connection can’t be just any random room or public area. At Happy Cities, senior housing researcher Madeleine Hebert says that one kind of space that developers often like to include – big, fancy, perfectly designed lounge spaces or outdoor areas with a couple of benches but nothing in particular to do there – don’t work. People need a reason to go (a playspace, a community garden, a space for a party or a yoga class), not just a photo opp.
“Where we see really lively spaces is where it’s used as an extension of their homes,” she said.
Ms. Dunn, whose research got a lot of attention during the height of COVID-19 isolation as everyone was trying to understand its effects, emphasizes that this area of research is so unexplored yet that she and her team end up having to do new studies just to figure out what to program into the software.
An established body of research shows that the more times a person sees someone else, the more likely they are to have a positive association. But she said a lot of other supposed research about social connections is “conjecture that doesn’t rise to the level of evidence.”
So she’s fascinated with the idea of breaking new ground. “I think this is a really exciting area.”
That kind of connection isn’t just a nice, feel-good thing, as any one of the people interested in this issue will tell you.
Backing them up, the U.S. Surgeon General has included a recommendation to “design the built environment to promote social connection” as one of six remedies to combat what his office has described as a catastrophe of loneliness in modern society that is affecting people’s mental and physical health.
Still and all, design only goes so far, they also emphasize.
Says Ms. Hoar: “It doesn’t matter how pretty the buildings are if you can’t afford them” or if you’re constantly anxious that you’re going to be evicted.

Full text: Policy professor at UBC and founder of Generation Squeeze, Canada’s leading voice for generational fairness T he federal budget always comes with a title summarizing its focus. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s early budgets emphasized a “strong middle class,” while the 2024 budget promises “fairness for every generation.”
Never before has a federal budget grappled with how class dynamics have been distorted by how a person’s age affects their standing in the housing system.
Income matters less than in the past. Secure housing and home equity matter more, privileging those of us who bought into the market decades ago.
The 2024 budget grapples with these class distortions as the starting point for a new fiscal framework, observing that: “Millennials and Gen Z are watching the middle-class dream become less and less achievable. They worry that they won’t ever be able to afford the kinds of homes they grew up in.”
This acknowledgment is a game changer, because the first step in solving a problem is admitting you have one.
The next steps will take more than a single budget can deliver, because generational unfairness crept into our economy and government slowly over decades. So we must beg for forgiveness from younger residents for the foreseeable future, and ask for their patience as the current government sets out to fix the problem in earnest.
Despite promising fairness for every generation, the 2024 budget is still a spending plan that privileges retirees.
OAS spending will increase by $31-billion a year by 2028, and medical care by another $17-billion – half of which is used by the 20 per cent of Canadians over age 64. In contrast to these big-ticket items, new military and housing spending will each increase by $2billion, and funding for a clean economy will increase by $8-billion. This means that the budget protects retirement security more than housing security, national security and climate security.
New spending for younger people also falls well short of the high bar set for retirees. Top-line items include $8-billion more for the Canada child benefit, $3-billion for $10-a-day child care, $8-billion for Employment Insurance and $6-billion for medical care for Canadians under age 45.
All told, the budget adds approximately $3,500 in new spending per person for our aging loved ones (even before counting additional spending delivered by the Canada Pension Plan to accommodate the growing number of seniors.) This figure is more than four times the approximately $800 invested per person under age 45.
While this gap remains large, the 2024 budget is narrowing it.
Last year, spending on each person over age 65 was over 5.5 times more than investments in younger Canadians. It will be imperative for Ottawa to continue to narrow the age gap in the coming years.
Even though the age pattern in spending is presently out-ofwhack, the government is showing progress in delivering concrete policies that will make lives better for young people. A national school food program will help ensure more than 400,000 children have nutritious meals.
The Child Care Expansion Loan Program will ensure more $10-aday child-care spaces are available. This will improve parents’ ability to save for other expenses, rather than pay a fee that equals another mortgage-sized payment.
HOUSING The 2024 budget investments to build new apartments, protect existing affordable rentals, build water, sewer and transit infrastructure, level the playing field for renters, and support first-time buyers to manage heavy mortgages will all make a meaningful, incremental difference in restoring housing affordability.
But there remains a key deficiency in the federal housing plan. By never mentioning the word “wealth,” the plan ignores why Canada has tolerated rising home prices rising in the first place. Owners, like me, got wealthier.
The seeds of this mindset were planted in 1972 when the government decided to create a home ownership tax shelter. For half a century, tax policy has encouraged many Canadians to treat housing not just as a place to call home, but also as a way to get rich – without having to pay many taxes on the accumulated wealth.
We now have a host of policies that incentivize Canadians to want home prices to rise, but work against plans to build enough affordable supply, and put in jeopardy our country’s ability to end the relentless increase in home prices so that earnings have a chance to catch up.
Over decades, these policy incentives inclined many Canadians to tolerate, if not welcome, a growing gap between average home prices and local earnings.
This trend accelerated in the new millennium when average home prices rose 60 per cent during prime minister Stephen Harper’s nine years in office (2006-2015), according to Canadian Real Estate data. Average prices have increased another 54 per cent since Justin Trudeau became Prime Minister.
So, while real progress is being made in the budget to improve affordability for millennials and Generation Z, it will take time to undo the scale of damage caused by poor housing policy decisions made in previous decades.
PAYING FOR BOOMERS It turns out that millennials and Gen Z aren’t just paying more for housing. They’re paying more taxes to fund boomer retirement expenses.
In anticipation of this budget, I contacted Statistics Canada for data to update my previous study about the evolution of income taxes paid for programs that support retirees. These figures show that the typical 35-year-old now pays around 40 per cent to 60 per cent more for boomers’ OAS and medical care than boomers paid as young people to support seniors in their day. (The precise amount varies by province and income). This extra tax burden on young people will only get heavier in the years to come as budget 2024 implements the planned spending increases for OAS.
Boomers benefited from the fact that “many hands make light work.” In the 1970s, there were seven working-age Canadians to support every retiree, thanks to the postwar baby boom. This ratio established the initial, relatively light tax levels required to provide a firm financial footing for OAS and medical care. But as boomers retired, the share of working-age residents contributing tax dollars to OAS and medical care shrank. Now there are just three per retiree. With fewer hands, the tax burden on each younger person grows heavier – even as they cope with greater financial insecurity.
This change in the ratio of retirees relative to workers is the primary driver of Ottawa’s current deficit problem.
Since the 2024 budget allocates an additional $38-billion in annual spending on OAS and medical care for retirees, revenue needs to rise to keep pace. We’re starting out behind, because provincial and federal governments did not set aside enough of the boomers’ tax dollars to fully cover the cost of publicly funded income and medical benefits as that generation retires. This failure of past planning is surprising, because in 1996, Ottawa astutely increased premiums for the Canada Pension Plan to protect that program from bankruptcy as a result of pressures from boomer retirements.
By failing to similarly adapt revenue plans to pay for OAS and medical care, past governments saddled current ones with a tough choice: raise taxes now, or endure a fundamental imbalance between revenue and expenditures.
Since tax increases remain unpopular with voters, this structural mismatch between spending and revenue drives frightening increases in debt servicing charges.
At $29-billion, interest payments on unpaid bills left to younger Canadians and future generations is the only part of the federal budget that rivals spending increases on boomers’ retirement.
This structural problem is not the result of a particular government or partisan ideology, despite Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre accusing Mr. Trudeau of “wasteful inflationary” spending in his response to the budget.
While it’s true that Mr. Trudeau’s government abandoned Mr. Harper’s prudent decision to raise the age of OAS eligibility from 65 to 67, that change would have only taken effect in 2023. So the near doubling of federal OAS spending over the first eight years of Mr. Trudeau’s term would have occurred regardless, and continuing increases were already baked into the fiscal framework – although not quite at the pace announced in the latest budget.
STRUCTURAL FIXES Overcoming the structural shortfall starts with the government’s continuing spending review.
Treasury Board President Anita Anand is on track to save $15-billion over five years by trimming spending from more than 60 federal departments.
Saving $15-billion is nothing to sneeze at, because it represents half of the $30-billion promised by the Trudeau government for the $10-a-day child care program over its first five years.
But, ultimately, reallocating $3billion a year barely begins to pay for the extra $38-billion in revenue earmarked for OAS and medical care for those over 64.
So the spending review needs to be more ambitious. The search for further savings should start with outdated tax shelters for retirees. For example, the Age and Pension Income credits date back to 1987, when financial challenges among seniors still lingered near or above those of younger people.
They enable retirees to shelter thousands of dollars from income taxation, and presently drain $6.4-billion from the federal budget. Some, or all, of this money could be redeployed to help cover the growing cost of OAS.
Better targeting OAS spending also merits consideration, because there is a big discrepancy between OAS and the Canada child benefit (CCB). Retirees with individual incomes of more than $80,000 still receive full OAS payments, regardless of their housing wealth. By contrast, the clawback for the CCB begins when household income surpasses $35,000 – an income level which mostly represents renters. CCB benefits are clawed back still further when household income exceeds $75,000.
TAXATION While the search for savings is imperative, opportunities to reallocate spending are likely too small to fill the revenue hole caused by poor planning for boomers’ retirement. The 2024 budget concedes as much by raising taxes on wealth. For the 0.13 per cent of Canadians who report $250,000 a year in profits from selling assets other than their principal residence, the portion of their profits subject to tax will increase from 50 per cent to 66 per cent. This change is projected to raise $19billion over five years, moving Canada closer to the 75-per-cent inclusion rate for capital gains set by prime minister Brian Mulroney in 1990.
At $4-billion a year, the new taxes on the most wealthy are still nowhere near enough to eliminate the structural deficit caused by poor planning for the retirement of boomers. There are few realistic options to eliminate structural deficits without putting younger generations in even more jeopardy if we don’t require some additional taxation from affluent folks my age and older (I’ll turn 50 this summer).
By affluent, I don’t just mean the superrich. I also mean those like me who enjoy secure housing and have gained wealth from rising home values. Some of this wealth could be used to help pay for the medical care and longterm care we will likely use, as well other programs that Canadians value.
By custom, we think of property taxation as a municipal practice. But Ottawa and the provinces also have constitutional powers to raise annual taxes from property. B.C. already does, and it uses progressive rates. This should become a model for federal consideration as Ottawa explores how best to adapt the tax system to fix the structural problems that now exist in the budget.
Adding national progressive rates to annual property taxation, perhaps targeting older Canadians like me living in the most valuable homes, would help to avoid placing most of the burden on younger Canadians to fix the failures of past governments.
AN END TO OVEREXTRACTION The payoff from eliminating this structural mismatch while still investing in well-being for young and old alike will be worth it for anyone concerned about our legacy. The prize is the end of a painful era of overextraction from younger and future generations.
We most commonly think about overextraction in environmental terms. We’ve extracted so much of the atmosphere’s limited capacity to absorb carbon that we leave a climate of extreme weather for those who follow. Overextraction is also a root cause of unaffordable housing. There is only so much wealth that can be extracted from our housing system.
Many homeowners like me have extracted an outsized amount of this wealth at the cost of making housing unaffordable for our offspring.
Structural deficits are a third example of intergenerational extraction. Most of the new government spending made possible by economic growth is being extracted to fund retirement and medical care supports for our aging loved ones. We sustain this extraction even though today’s retirees have the lowest rates of poverty and the highest levels of wealth relative to other age groups.
The antidote to overextraction is a commitment to generational fairness. The 2024 budget takes important steps to embed this principle into the machinery of government.
It incrementally reduces the age gap in federal spending by improving child care and housing affordability, incentivizes us to leave less pollution for our kids to clean up, warns that OAS is increasing far faster than any other item in the budget, raises taxes on the wealthy to avoid adding more taxes to the young, and persists with its spending review to reduce the deficit.
There remains much more work to do in future budgets to restore fairness for every generation. But it is fair to say these initial steps set in motion a grand national project to renew our commitment to preserve a healthy childhood, home, retirement and planet so we all leave a legacy of which we can all be proud.

A multiplex reno tries to fit in: ‘We never thought [by] supplying housing in this community, we would be the bad guys,’ infill developer says

Full text: Developer Brendan Charters switches easily from Shakespearean – “if a renter pricks, do they not bleed?” – to Sinatra’s “I’m so proud I’m bustin’ my vest” as he looks around the kitchen.
“I actually love coming in here,” he says of the rental property Eurodale Developments, the company he co-founded with Jim Cunningham, created at 31 Roslin Ave. near Toronto’s tony Teddington Park neighbourhood. “The plants on the windowsill, the pot on the stove – people are living here. It was an uphill battle, it was a tremendous amount of work … but the house was unlivable when we bought it.”
Judging from photographs Mr. Charters took in November, 2019, he’s right: ceiling tiles sag and Formica cracks in the dark, knotty pine kitchen; pokey, dim rooms show fading paint on cracking plaster; dirty carpets cover bedroom floors; and a worn, bowed staircase leads down into a dank, mouldy basement.
Yet, when he finally received permits after almost two years – and that’s an entirely different story – he was met with incredible neighbourhood opposition. The ironic thing, he adds, is that the district already allowed multiplexes of two units, or four units (or more), but Eurodale chose to apply to build three (they wanted a basement unit, a main-floor unit and a two-floor, four-bedroom unit for a family). This gave NIMBYs (Not-In-My-Backyard) extra ammunition to fight, he says, since even permitted multiplexes were “hotly contested because there are very few examples of it” in the Yonge Street and Lawrence Avenue area.
“There was this Facebook hate group,” he continues, “and we were, like, ‘Oh my goodness.’ We never thought [by] supplying housing in this community, we would be the bad guys.”
Toronto, despite its 21st-century worldliness, can still exhibit echoes of its 1950s and 60s conservatism, especially when it comes to the perceived erosion of its leafy, single-family neighbourhoods. Search The Globe and Mail or Toronto Star digital archives with keyword “cliff-dweller” for those decades and multiple stories on ruinous apartment houses come oozing up. Some warn that superintendents are the “new breed of dictator,” others that fire departments won’t be able to reach these new heights, and still others bemoan that poor little Timmy will never feel a blade of grass caress his cheek.
And despite a housing shortage that’s similar to the one experienced in the postwar period, those who choose, today, to insert three or four units into a singlefamily home, or replace a single home on a large lot with three townhouses, are increasingly becoming villainized. Mr. Charters points to a famous controversy – as reported by the New York Times – over 1310 Haskell St. in Berkeley, Calif.: when a developer purchased a crumbling singlefamily home and proposed “a trio of small homes” neighbours went ballistic, since “low density living is treated as sacrosanct.”
But, continued writer Conor Dougherty in 2017, “what is happening in Berkeley may be coming soon to a neighbourhood near you.”
It has. Yet a new resident of Roslin Avenue would be hardpressed to pick out Mr. Charter’s building, since it looks almost exactly like all the other houses.
And, should she be invited inside any of the three units, she’d likely leave with some design inspiration, since there are creamy white walls and countertops balanced by black light fixtures, black door pulls and faucets, sensible kitchens that sport high-end appliances, spacious bathrooms and natural light is abundant even in the basement unit, which also features a polished concrete floor with radiant heating.
“But it also has forced air as a supplementary heating and cooling [system],” Mr. Charters adds.
Eurodale spent in the range of $700 – 800 per square foot “in order to do it in a high-quality manner” to match the neighbourhood: “custom kitchens, a good HVAC system and insulation, and brick [cladding] and a steel roof; we didn’t want a property that’s falling down.” This means that, even with full tenancy, Mr. Charters says it’ll take a quarter-century until the company is paid back, and that’s with a basement unit priced at about $2,300 a month, the main floor at almost $3,000 and the two-floor unit at $5,000.
“Don’t get me wrong – this is not affordable housing,” he admits.
Which is why, in this writer’s opinion, the backlash Eurodale experienced was so unexpected.
Frat boys or transients aren’t going to move into 31 Roslin Ave.
During my tour of the units – all occupied since the project wrapped this past December – I spotted nothing nefarious, only children’s drawings on the fridge, framed family photos, and sparse furnishings owing to the current economic climate. If I lived beside this property, I’d be delighted to see it renovated so expertly by a company with so much experience, and I’d enjoy having three families to get to know rather than just one (like when I lived in downtown Montreal in a triplex on a street of triplexes).
So, despite Premier Doug Ford’s hesitation to allow as-ofright fourplexes across Ontario, it’s my hope that most municipalities will appreciate that social ills will not multiply should a few multiplexes (with market-rate rent) be added to the streetscape.
But no doubt many will still get cold feet.
“That’s why we say that you can’t strip the politics from planning,” Mr. Charters finishes. “If the direction doesn’t come from the state or the province, the local politics will be the sand in the gears of housing progress forever … when we’re complaining about house pricing, we only have ourselves to blame as local members of the community because we’re the ones that are directing the counsellors to fight this stuff.”
The building at 31 Roslin Ave. is a finalist in the CHBA’s National Awards for Housing Excellence in the “Best Whole Home Renovation Over $800,000” category. The winner will be announced on May 10.

At McNally Robinson, it’s all about the books: The Winnipeg-based retailer has become Canada’s largest English-language indie bookstore by sticking to its focus

Full text: One of the first things you notice when you walk into McNally Robinson Booksellers on any given day is the buzz.
On the first Monday morning in March, after a weekend-long snowstorm caused sporadic power outages and school closings, the store in Winnipeg’s Grant Park Shopping Centre was teeming with customers. On an unusually warm Saturday night the month prior, it was just as busy.
Two young women laughed next to the magazines. A couple in their late 60s walked out with a kraft-paper bag full of mystery books for a coming trip. A trio of teenagers eyed graphic novels as one of them snapped photos of the group’s outing on his phone.
Navigating the aisles feels effortless. The aura is cozy and relaxed. But what makes the Prairies-based retailer so magical for shoppers is decades of hard-won business savvy. The careful consideration behind each of its three location’s layout, design and inventory – alongside a commitment to keep books as the nucleus of its operations – has quietly allowed McNally Robinson to become Canada’s largest independent English-language bookstore company.
The stores break the cardinal rules of corporate branding and retail: None are the same. Each has decided what works best for it through the help of its customers’ habits.
Some hold events, have bistrostyle restaurants and community classrooms; others do not. In the sprawling Saskatoon location, a five-minute drive from the University of Saskatchewan, academic books dominate the shelves. The comparatively dainty store at the Forks Market, Winnipeg’s go-to hangout spot and tourist attraction, is a little haven of gifts for readers, the majority of whom wander there on a whim. Everything beyond the paperbacks and hardcovers is a purposeful afterthought that complements the book-buying experience.
McNally Robinson, which is not obligated to report financials as a private company, made $20.4-million in total sales in the 2023 fiscal year, according to figures shared with The Globe and Mail. It is a far cry from so many other indie bookstores around the world that have suffered at the hands of internet giants such as Amazon, or that have shut down altogether amid the national expansions of big-box chains such as Indigo Books & Music in this country and Barnes & Noble Booksellers south of the border. Even Indigo reported a widened annual loss of nearly $50-million in 2023.
After years of trying and failing to sell general merchandise, dismissing books for different retail verticals – mostly to offset the damage from Amazon’s dominance of e-commerce by attempting to boost brick-andmortar sales through Hail Mary shifts – book retailers at large could stand to take a page from the McNally Robinson model.
And, recently, the big players have started to move in that direction. After spearheading a turnaround at British retailer Waterstones Booksellers, industry veteran James Daunt took over as chief executive of Barnes & Noble in 2019, transforming the chain through a back-to-basics, booksfirst approach that has already provided a boost in sales.
At Indigo, which turned private this month after years of losing money, founder and returning chief executive officer Heather Reisman noted in late 2023 that, “over the last while, somehow books felt like they were not the heart and soul” of the stores.
Reisman is now trying to get the more than 150 stores under her ownership to make books the star of the show again. The McNally blueprint is a likely balm for her company, too.
“All we do know is that if you want to run a successful bookstore, the books have to be your greatest, biggest and only focus,” says Lori Baker, one of the two co-owners who took over the reins at McNally Robinson nearly a decade ago.
This might surprise many Canadians, but the people who run McNally Robinson and figured out the formula for its recent success haven’t talked to the McNally family in years.
It’s not because of bad blood.
It’s because they don’t have much reason to, Baker explains.
“We’re finally doing our own thing.”
Holly McNally started a business with her husband, Paul McNally, that was successful – until, suddenly, it wasn’t. In 1980, the booklovers enlisted the help of merchandiser Ron Robinson, a recently laid-off employee from the Eaton’s department store whom the couple had read about in a news article. The first location, at Winnipeg’s Kenaston Village Mall, opened in 1981, and the three of them spent the next 35 years telling everybody who would hear it how McNally Robinson is the best bookstore in the world.
That location is now gone, as are many others that were once under McNally Robinson’s banner. Three remain: two in Winnipeg and one in Saskatoon.
The downfall commenced shortly after the company opened a location in the Shops at Don Mills mall in Toronto. Yes, it was 2008. Sure, there were signs of a historic recession, and they had just shut down a Calgary store after only five years because of a rise in real estate costs and labour expenses. But the Toronto venture was part of a tried-andtested trend for the McNallys: Open a bookstore in a large mall, model it after the successful locations in Winnipeg and keep expanding the brand.
“The problem was: Toronto isn’t Winnipeg,” says Baker, who joined the company as a controller in 2007 and managed accounting. “They were expanding too fast. And they didn’t get that simply replicating our stores wasn’t going to work. This isn’t a franchise.”
By 2009, McNally Robinson was forced to declare bankruptcy.
Baker remembers her and Chris Hall, who managed the company’s literature sections since the 1990s, getting an e-mail in the fall from the McNallys to meet them at their back office at the Grant Park headquarters. They asked whether the two wanted to stay with the company, as they planned to lay off a majority of the staff.
In 2012, just as things were finally feeling normal after a few difficult years of barely breaking even, the McNallys called Hall and Baker to the office again – this time to announce they were retiring. The couple wanted Hall and Baker to own and run the business, with their daughter Tori McNally.
On the day they were supposed to buy the company’s shares, Tori McNally pulled out.
Baker and Hall went ahead with the purchase anyway.
The three-year transition process with the McNallys was an emotional time, Baker says. “I think, by the end, we were almost waiting for them to go. We wanted to turn the business back to its focus.”
The Globe could not reach the McNallys for comment. (In 2004, their other daughter, Sarah McNally, opened a McNally Robinson branch in New York, which she says split from the parent chain in 2008 and is now McNally Jackson Books.)
After the sale was finalized in 2015, Hall and Baker began to bring the stores back to a slower, steadier growth. They did not rely on opening new locations for better profit margins. Instead, they expanded their inventory with the best and latest titles, forging lasting relationships with publishers and promising authors.
The pandemic proved that Hall and Baker’s strategy was the right call.
In the holiday season of 2020, demand was surprisingly overwhelming. McNally Robinson was getting hundreds of book orders a day and thousands over the weekends. “We weren’t fully staffed, but everybody wanted to let us know how much they appreciated our place in the community as they waited to pick out their books from our shelves again,” Hall says.
The company changed almost everything – updating its online system, setting up different pickup options for books, creating new roles for its well-followed social-media accounts and running delivery services for the restaurants.
“At first, it always just felt like we were taking care of somebody else’s place,” Hall says. “During COVID, we truly approached things our way.”
Baker adds: “The pandemic years also taught us how much people have returned to physical reading. Books will always be our focus for this reason.”
McNally Robinson is now in a much better position for the future. In the past four years, it has saved up a ton of money, including at least $100,000 from halting the physical printing and mailing of its newsletters alone. Between January, 2019, and January, 2024, its annual sales grew 11 per cent.
Still, Hall and Baker are being cautious about opening new locations. The addition at the Forks in 2018 was an easy choice, Hall says, because it’s one of the most popular spots in the city. But it remains the only bookstore they started from scratch. The thing they really don’t want to lose by expanding too fast is their connection to the community.
Executive manager Angela Torgerson’s face lights up on a jaunt across the Grant Park bookstore, as she points to the specialty socks on display. She says she found the German-made products donning illustrations of classic paintings during one of her many overseas trips for the company.
Any non-book items go through a selection process that begins with one question: Would a booklover appreciate this? “If the answer is yes, we pick it up and put it on our shelves,” Torgerson says.
Once such an item sells out, McNally Robinson often does not restock. Not only is each store different, each visit to the same store is as well.
“There’s so many stores that do the same thing of everything,” Hall says. “They sell you so much stuff without any focus or selections. We have an edge with McNally that they don’t.”
The company would never expect its customers to buy more general merchandise than books, or even the same amount. “That ratio of wanting to see something like a candle or toy picked up for every book at the counter is just bizarre for us to even think about,” Torgerson says.
What all of these decisions reveal to customers is the heart of the business: that McNally is listening to its reader-centred community. The faces of Canadian authors in giant photos on the walls demonstrate a sense of local pride. The McNally rewards card is laminated in front of you, just like a small-town library card.
“And nothing is more locally geared or specific than our events,” says John Toews, a softspoken force who co-ordinates the kind of functions for the company that have made McNally Robinson a must-stop on national and international book tours.
He says events became a lifeline after the bankruptcy, not necessarily financially, but for the company’s long-term viability and spirit. “We realized that if we wanted to remain around, the community needed to embrace us as a part of its fabric.”
Prominent authors who would have never thought to visit Winnipeg or Saskatoon find the cities becoming their new favourites because of the audiences that show up to buy their books at signings. “McNally held the most exciting event we had for our book,” says Andrew Stobo Sniderman, New York-based author of the 2022 bestseller Valley of the Birdtail.
“It’s just so cool that they have their own in-house bestseller list, which features first-time writers next to the legends,” he adds.
“They spend weeks promoting your book at the store before people even get to read it, creating that important anticipation. And when you’re there, it’s like magic.”
Toronto-based Miriam Toews, a bestselling author of nine books, including Women Talking, which last year was adapted by Sarah Polley into an Oscar-winning film, credits McNally Robinson for kicking off her literary career with a job at the Winnipeg store. She says it will always be dearest to her.
Rodrigo Beilfuss, artistic director of Winnipeg theatre company Shakespeare in the Ruins, says McNally Robinson’s achievements are owed in large part to its partnerships with the sizeable but often underrated arts scene in Manitoba. “Along with us, they partner with so many other community groups here in a way that is beyond the superficial stuff. They get us and we get them,” he says of the symbiosis.
“McNally is a local institution, and maybe that’s why it is harder for it to translate in cities like Toronto or Vancouver that don’t always have that sense of community going for them. Like a lot of other great things on the Prairies, people here might take this for granted until they know it really doesn’t exist elsewhere.”

A pinwheel home in rural Caledon: Rising ever so slightly above the land sits a light-filled retreat that is connected with nature

Full text: Maybe you’d send a nautilus shell, because of that perfect Fibonacci sequence. Or, if sunsets are your thing, you’d send the best photo from your most recent vacation.
If it’s your contention that the Jaguar E-Type was the most beautiful car ever produced, send an article on its creation.
Just don’t send Trevor Wallace of Reflect Architecture a photograph of your favourite building.
“We ask them for images that inspire them,” says the 41-yearold with a smile, “as long as they’re not architecture or design.” The reason, he expands, is because he’d be doing his clients – and himself – a disservice if he “regurgitates” something that’s already out there. “We want to get to know them.”
He got to know hockey broadcaster Shawn McKenzie and his partner, Sydney Hoffman, a content creator, through panoramic vacation photographs of Greece and Italy and, in particular, the stone walls that would often appear in them: some beautiful, some abandoned, and some simply there to “hold the land back.”
So, when Mr. Wallace accompanied the thirty-something couple to their newly acquired, rough and wild, 0.7 hectares of land in rural Caledon, he was thinking of those stone walls. He was also thinking of a particular spot where there was a slight grade change, and that a house with a great wall of windows might work well there.
“He was just silent,” says Ms. Hoffman, describing Mr. Wallace as he crouched in the snow among the brambles and small cedars. “And we’re, like, ‘Do you not like it?’ In his brain he was going over the light, and these are things I didn’t even think about, so it was very fascinating; after about 10 minutes he started talking.”
And the couple so liked what they heard they provided only a few programmatic details: two small guestrooms (one for a possible first child); an ample living room with a large fireplace; a kitchen island with no stools (“We had an island with stools at our last condo and we never used them,” says Ms. Hoffman); a small banquette-style dining area but no formal dining room; and a decent-sized primary bedroom.
And then they let him go back to the big city to sketch.
“And, no word of a lie, Trevor sent us the first – I don’t know if it was just the drawings, I don’t think it was the rendering, that came later – and I don’t think we changed a thing; I think I removed one door and maybe a plug,” says Ms. Hoffman.
It’s easy to understand why.
Rising ever so slightly above the land, an object seems to have stopped while in the process of unfolding; a pinwheel of delicate flower petals forever paused and transformed into solid steel and glass. Solid walls rise higher as if to protect the glass ones. Angles are origami-crisp and mullions are minimal. And, like a chameleon, the sky dictates the colour: pink sunset, pinkish house; steel grey January day, smoky grey house.
But the visitor won’t see any of that coming up the driveway. No, poke through that aperture of trees and it’s a blank building of mystery. Two slotlike openings – with welcoming lighting and wood-clad walls thank goodness – are the architectural equivalent of a curled index finger asking one to approach.
“Before we had to do some value engineering these outer walls were all going to be stone,” says Mr. Wallace. “The idea that there would be these three bands of fieldstone that would be a found wall and that, in order to get into the architecture, you kind of come through these cracks.”
Step into the crack, trot down a few steps and the mystery box opens up to endless windows and light. And, in the living room and primary bedroom a trompe l’oeil has been achieved: the floor-toceiling windows seem to go further down than the floor and higher up than the ceiling. How?
A tiny trough between the floor and the window-wall (big enough for the dogs to use) hides the heat registers and, above, another trough (which could contain curtain hardware but isn’t really needed here) before a slightly dropped ceiling that still contains “the required assemblies … to get the really good R-values that we were looking to achieve.”
And, to make life easier for the inhabitants of this 1,700-squarefoot, C-shaped jewel box (and so it doesn’t become a heat box the glass walls all face north), each of its three sections has a defined role. The top of the C is the living room, where the highlight is a massive fireplace with an equally impressive hearth of local, greenish granite where Gary (one of the dogs) loves to warm himself. To the right of the fireplace is a wall of log storage, with metal frame still to come.
The middle of the C is the kitchen. Here, all eyes will land on the 18-foot-long island: “There were a few gasps when we told them how long the island would be,” Mr. Wallace says with a laugh.
“Yes,” agrees Ms. Hoffman with a laugh. “But I cook so much now that I’m so grateful.”
Yet, even with its busy, swirly stone cladding (“Muskoka Tides” in a leathered finish) the minimalism of the Scavolini cabinets allows it to breathe, and the tangible connection to the outdoors – the glass ‘wall’ here slides open to connect the kitchen to sunshine and birdsong – makes it seem as if a friendly rock just pushed up through the kitchen floor to begin a new life.
The bottom of the C is the private stuff: primary bedroom, which is quite small, walk-in closet, and the generous bathroom, which connects to a shelteredand-treed yoga deck for Ms. Hoffman (which might also sport a couple of chairs so Mr. McKenzie can use it too, she says, but since the couple only moved in this past autumn, they haven’t purchased any yet).
For the price of a fixer-upper in Toronto – with a to-the-studs renovation – here is a private, thoughtful retreat that is a delight to behold. For Mr. McKenzie, who travels constantly for work, it’s a 45-minute drive to the airport; for Ms. Hoffman, who enjoys hiking and cross-country skiing, it’s paradise found.
And for Mr. Wallace? A pictureperfect building and a job very, very well done.

A denser city? In The Annex, neighbours say no: A new apartment building in Toronto’s core represents a major assault to the single-family ‘Yellowbelt’

Full text: It’s “as gentle as razor wire.” It is “a dangerous precedent.” It is a new apartment building.
But it is a new apartment building in The Annex, on a street that is otherwise filled with houses. And so this proposal at 171 Lowther Ave. prompted some fiery rhetoric last week at Toronto East York Community Council.
The development does represent a significant shift in Toronto planning – for the better. For 50 years, the city’s house neighbourhoods have been a giant fortress.
Apartment buildings have been banned almost entirely.
Now the politics of housing are changing fast. The federal government is working to deliver new density in cities across the country. Yet this meeting in Toronto showed that some people are not ready for that change.
“This project is in no way gentle intensification,” said the architect Terry Montgomery, representing the powerful local group the Annex Residents Association.
“It will set a dangerous precedent for all areas in the city which currently [are zoned for] low-scale residential-buildings.”
It’s not clear whether that legal argument is true. At the meeting, City of Toronto planning manager David Driedger and director Oren Tamir – who, to their great credit, were supporting the development – said it would not set a precedent.
But if it did, why would that be “dangerous”? It is commonsensical. The Lowther site has two subway stations within an eight-minute walk. Toronto’s Line 1 and Line 2 intersect right here. This is one of the best-located, best-connected places in all of Canada.
That’s why this development is happening. In 2019, the Ontario government directed cities to plan for density in “major transit station areas.” That policy is both sensible and just. But Toronto city hall responded with as little change as possible – at least in the poshest neighbourhoods – and the details are still in dispute.
Meanwhile, some landowners are using the provincial policy to justify density.
At 38 Walmer Rd., very close to the Lowther site, the developer TAS is working with the Walmer Road Baptist Church to preserve its historic sanctuary and add a 20-storey residential tower. Next door, a landlord proposes to demolish an existing apartment building and build a 35-storey tower. One of those seems likely to be built.
And on Lowther, a local family that owns three houses is following suit. Working with Gabriel Fain Architects and the planners WND, they want to replace two houses with an 11-storey, 64-unit building. The architecture is handsome and witty. Its irregular, brick-clad base playfully evokes the neighbourhood’s Edwardian and Victorian picturesque houses. Its upper portion, lined in white metal and punctuated by vertical fins, nods to the jaunty modernist apartment towers that joined the neighbourhood in the 1960s.
Yes, The Annex has towers: dozens of them, which occupy a small fraction of its land yet house the majority of its residents. Right next door to the Lowther site is a 10-storey apartment building that dates from around 1970. Houses and apartments. This is The Annex, and this is Toronto.
While the provincial policy changes seem clear, and the social imperative to build more housing seems equally clear, some people in the Annex seem to feel that this change shouldn’t happen in their backyard. Half a century ago, the Annex Residents Association fought hard against the area’s first towers. And this week, the words about “razor wire” came in a letter from the ARA, signed by co-chairs Elizabeth Sisam and Henry Wiercinski. At the meeting, ARA supporters struck a similarly alarmist tone. For them, allowing a set of houses to be replaced by apartments represented a dangerous collapse of order.
“This is a matter of breaking the rules,” said 40-year local resident Brydon Gombay. “If they’re broken on Dalton Road, which is a quiet street of affordable housing, then why not do it on all the streets west of here? We could become an area of high towers and I don’t think that’s what people want.”
These arguments are typical of antidevelopment rhetoric across the country. Existing residents often believe that they are entitled to keep their neighbourhoods the same. They often argue that new development doesn’t belong, is destructive, doesn’t fit, and is less “affordable” than what’s there.
(For the record, the last house to sell on affordable Dalton Road, in December, fetched $2.7-million.
The realtor’s sales pitch said it was “renovated to perfection.”) A more sympathetic variation came from a younger resident, Rebecca Arshawsky. She spoke of the community in the rooming house where she lives with four roommates and a cat, and expressed her fears of being displaced. This redevelopment “will incentivize developers to buy up the surrounding properties, like my landlord’s,” she said, visibly emotional, “and kick me out of my home in the guise of more housing.”
Her feelings are entirely understandable. But her analysis of the issue was entirely backward. Even if a developer bought her home for a redevelopment, she would be entitled by Toronto planning policy to compensation, and possibly even a brand-new apartment at low rent.
The alternative – the status quo – is far more dangerous to tenants like her. If Ms. Arshawsky’s landlord chooses to sell the house, she can be evicted with minimal compensation. Then the house’s new owners will almost certainly renovate the house into a single-family home.
This is what has happened in this neighbourhood over and over since the 1970s. That’s why Ms. Arshawsky’s block has lost a third of its population, according to census data, from 800 residents in 1971 to 519 in 2016.
The whole neighbourhood is down about 6,000 people over that time, a period in which the Toronto region tripled in population. As the geographer Anna Kramer pointed out in the 2019 book House Divided, which I coedited, such shrinking neighbourhoods are endemic in Toronto.
This latter narrative is nuanced. And it doesn’t fit the familiar 1970s story that has shaped local politics and the planning profession: the story of evil developers and underdog neighbours, of modest houses and looming apartments. David and Goliath. But that story was never entirely true, and today it’s just false.
Among the neighbours complaining about the new building was a Greg Sorbara. “There are currently applications for redevelopments that would place nearly 600 hundred new residences at this one small intersection in our area,” Mr. Sorbara complained.
But Mr. Sorbara should understand the planning picture as well as anyone. He is a wealthy realestate developer who served as Ontario Finance Minister in the Liberal government that introduced the Places To Grow Act.
This is the anti-sprawl law that now protects Ontario’s Greenbelt. Now it could reshape his backyard. In public comments in 2022, he argued that another new tower “does not fit” and does not belong.
Will the Lowther tower be approved? Councillor Dianne Saxe, clearly besieged by the public response, punted on a decision; it will now be decided by city council in April. Almost certainly that will be a rubber-stamp. As it should be – even if some people want to line their neighbourhoods in razor wire.

Full text: When couples meet with a financial planner, they’ll most likely talk to one focused on saving, investing and leaving behind an inheritance for children.
Which is great – unless you’re not planning on having children.
For dual-income no-kid couples – commonly referred to as DINKs – their significantly different financial reality needs to be front and centre in these conversations. Although not all of them will end up wealthy, they’re all saving hundreds of thousands of dollars by not having a child. And that extra disposable income opens up a world of freedom.
According to the most recent estimate from Statistics Canada, it costs $350,000 to raise one child from birth to age 17. That figure rises by 29 per cent if parents support that child through postsecondary education to 22 years old. (Of course these days, some kids live at their parents’ home well into their 20s and even 30s.)
While not all DINKs deliberately choose not to have kids, as birth rates around the world drop, it’s not surprising that their numbers are rising: There were 1.9 million DINK households in Canada as of 2021, up from 1.7 million in 2012.
So how is DINK life different? Child-free couples have more flexibility in how they shape their lives because they’re not paying and saving for all sorts of kid-related expenses. It may not be as important to them to own a multibedroom home, one that’s near a good daycare or school. They can be riskier with their careers, decide to power-save for retirement and choose not to buy life insurance.
That’s the bright side, but there are also unique hurdles that DINKs face, such as how to prepare for old age without any support from adult kids, or navigate a legal system that often assumes your children will handle your estate.
It’s important, then, for these couples to seek advice from someone who understands the differences. That may be harder than it sounds, though.
Samantha Sykes, an investment adviser and a personal financial planner at Raymond James Wealth Management, says the investment world is traditional, and many established advisors aren’t set up to think outside of the box for DINKs.
She suggests finding someone who can relate might trump years spent in the business. “To me, having people who are experienced and battle tested, yet not ready to retire in the next five to 10 years, will be good listeners and provide holistic financial wealth management to people who are DINKs,” said Ms. Sykes, who is based in Toronto and has many DINK clients herself.
Jay Zigmont, a U.S.-based financial planner who focuses on child-free couples – a specialization not yet taken up in Canada – says DINKs need to shop around. “Ask your planner if your financial plan would be different without kids, and if your planner says it’s not different as a DINK, then just turn around and walk away.”
Mr. Zigmont also recommends using a fee-only adviser with a flat rate per appointment, because advisers who charge through a percentage of your investments or through product sales are, by default, biased to sell more products and increase your portfolio size. But DINKs might not always need their accounts to grow the same way as traditional families.
Other differences for DINKs can include more complicated end-of-life planning, what to do when you’ve maxed out your RRSPs and TFSAs, whether to buy life insurance, and if it’s worth investing in riskier portfolios to reach early or aggressive retirement goals.
Ms. Sykes’s big-picture advice for DINKs is that they not fall for the trap of comparing their financial lives with others. Yes, they may be saving a hypothetical $350,000 by not having kids. But they shouldn’t feel bad if making lifestyle decisions means there isn’t an extra $350,000 in their savings account.
Ultimately, being a DINK does create more flexibility in your finances and your life. To see how that can play out, we spoke with four couples about how that freedom shapes their lives, and their financial plans.
Mortgage-free home ownership now, fun later THE MORTGAGE-FREE WORKAHOLICS Jennifer Herman, 46, and Michael Ball, 47, Ottawa Jennifer Herman set herself a goal when she first bought her Ottawa home 20 years ago as a 26-yearold: She wanted it paid off before she turned 40.
Her husband, Michael Ball, thought that was too ambitious.
But years of discipline and chipping away at the mortgage on their $200,000 home paid off, and the couple were successfully mortgage-free by the time Ms. Herman was 39.
“Those were the years where, other than on a birthday or an anniversary, there were no fancy dinners,” she said. “But that short-term pain allows for now, I don’t have to think about the price of broccoli or the price at the pump.”
Ms. Herman and Mr. Ball were deliberate in how they used the extra time and money they had by forgoing parenthood. The first 20 years of their adult life were spent diligently saving and building up their careers. And while every bonus went to the mortgage, much of the couple’s income went toward their RRSPs.
The couple started a marketing company together 15 years ago. They put in long hours – and still work up to 60 hours a week – to grow their business into a successful endeavour.
Now, some of their money can go toward immediate pleasures.
They’ve renovated their mortgage-free home, converting it from four bedrooms to two larger ones, with ample space for them to work from home. They also added a gazebo to the back of the property.
They reap the benefits of debt-free life by splurging: eating at Michelin-starred restaurants when they feel like it, and booking vacations without too much thought – like the six weeks they recently spent in Maui.
Mr. Ball, a guitar player who loves heavy metal, recently bought VIP tickets to a Metallica concert.
The $5,000 package came with backstage access where he met two members of the band, and a special floor space to watch the concert right in front of the stage.
Ms. Herman says one thing she is concerned about is the expense of retirement, which she has been saving for diligently. It’s the only area of her life that she thinks may be more expensive than it is for couples with children.
She says there’s no guaranteed family help available if one of them needs long-term care in their old age.
“I can’t rely on Michael’s niece and nephews to step in and look after us, and as good as our friendships are, they’re not traditionally the relationships you rely on for that stage of your life,” said Ms. Herman.
She says they have probably saved adequately for retirement, but the lack of support means they’d prefer to have a larger financial cushion in case they need extra care.
On the topic of care during the later years, Ms. Sykes from Raymond James Wealth Management advises DINKs to always keep their will and power of attorney up to date. Otherwise, they run the risk of their money and possessions being seized by the government, or having a court-appointed representative making medical decisions.
Of course, Ms. Herman and Mr. Ball are still young and in the prime of their careers. Sometimes, they think about having to work harder and longer to be extra safe in retirement, and that’s not always an easy thought when they have a bad day at work. But other times, they also think about how much they love working for the business they’ve built.
“We could do this until we’re no longer going to be on this planet,” said Ms. Herman.
Never owning a home at all THE NOMADIC RENTERS Veronica Ochoa, 39, and Jamie Watson, 40, Vancouver Unlike a lot of Canadians, Veronica Ochoa and Jamie Watson aren’t determined to own a home.
They rent a small one-bedroom apartment in Vancouver, and they like the flexibility that provides of easily packing up and moving at any time.
That mindset is how they ended up moving to Vancouver from London, England, three years ago.
After 11 years in Britain, they wanted to try living somewhere else, and Vancouver was the first appealing place where one of them landed a job.
Ms. Ochoa hates the idea of feeling obligated to make important life decisions in a certain way.
That’s part of the reason she didn’t want kids.
“Life is complicated enough as it is,” said Ms. Ochoa, who works as a sustainability consultant, adding that she also would prefer to avoid the environmental impact of having a child.
With the low monthly cost of their small apartment and their disciplined spending, the couple are able to focus on retirement by funnelling large amounts of their income toward savings. Mr. Watson says their TFSAs are maxed out and they make healthy contributions to their RRSPs. As citizens of the U.K., they also have sizeable savings in their U.K. equivalents of those tax-sheltered accounts.
As a result, for a couple entering their 40s, they are very well prepared for retirement – whereas their savings would be much smaller if they had children.
“We’d invest but the values would be a lot less and we would lose out on compounding interest,” said Mr. Watson.
For her part, Ms. Sykes says DINKs should still get advice after they’ve maxed out on their RRSPs and TSFAs, and that they might consider putting funds into real estate or private equity. And in order to minimize how much tax they pay, she suggests they proactively make tax-deductible donations, especially if they plan to leave money to charities in their will.
The flexibility of the child-free life also benefited Ms. Ochoa’s career. When the couple first moved to Canada for Mr. Watson’s job as an engineering consultant, she took advantage of not working for a while and enrolled in extra courses.
“Being able to take a step back and not worry about money was something that I could actually do,” she said.
If they decide they want to, the couple says it’s possible for them to eventually work part-time or retire early. Ms. Ochoa says they’ve talked about retiring in Mexico, where she’s originally from and where her parents reside. Having the option to retire in a more affordable part of the world at an age where parents may otherwise still be supporting adult children is another advantage that Mr. Watson points out.
When it comes to factoring in increased expenses in old age, Ms. Ochoa says they never imagined or relied on getting help from family, so being child-free hasn’t changed much about their retirement plans.
They considered getting life insurance at one point, but an adviser recommended against it, since the two are financially stable on their own and don’t have any dependants. And the fact that this protection is less crucial goes back to one of their main reasons for not having kids: There are few personal and financial obligations that come with their current lifestyle.
“There’s a peace of mind for us that we don’t have to worry, and we’re both very independent,” said Ms. Ochoa.
Career and lifestyle THE SELF-EMPLOYED PASSION SEEKERS Wendy Underwood, 48, and Kurtis Kolt, 49, Vancouver Fourteen years ago, Wendy Underwood and Kurtis Kolt made the bold decision to uproot their stable financial lives and became self-employed.
Ms. Underwood left her job in corporate media relations to create her own travel marketing and communications firm. Mr. Kolt, meanwhile, went from working for a restaurant to starting a consulting business, writing about wine and becoming the co-proprietor of a Vancouver wine festival.
And while the two of them have been successful, their career decisions weren’t driven by maximizing their income.
For Ms. Underwood, running her own business gave her the freedom to pick and choose clients that would be more fun and fulfilling to work with, as opposed to the ones that pay the most.
Meanwhile, Mr. Kolt was able to dive into writing and takes pride in the success of his wine festival, despite the fact that it’s not the most lucrative endeavour he could pursue.
“It’s different from friends who’ve had to take whatever work comes their way or hold on to a ‘boring office job’ when they don’t necessarily love it because it comes with parental leaves, health benefits and things like that,” said Ms. Underwood.
Their careers demand plenty of their time.
There’s travel, evening events and irregular schedules they’re happy to accommodate, thanks to their flexible schedules.
The couple also says their child-free life is the main reason they’re able to own a property in Mount Pleasant, a trendy part of downtown Vancouver. They first bought a one-bedroom condo in Vancouver in 2008, and if they did end up having a kid they would not have been able to afford buying a two-bedroom unit.
The two have also found that being child-free, and the financial flexibility that comes with that, makes it easy to accommodate the fact that they have very different relationships to money.
Ms. Underwood never carries debt on her credit card, even if it means eating beans and toast for a week to ensure her balance is at zero. Mr. Kolt, on the other hand, doesn’t mind the odd splurge and carrying a credit-card balance – something that would make his wife nervous if their budget was tighter.
“Having that argument over money every month is just not necessary,” said Ms. Underwood, adding that they’re aware that money can be a common reason for relationships to fail.
She said their different approaches to spending would be difficult if they had children and one of them started working more or less as a result. This way, they each feel very financially independent within their marriage.
They do, however, think carefully about how they’ll prepare for old age, especially the possibility that they will need to be cared for because of health issues.
In case one of them was to die unexpectedly, the couple elected to get a term life insurance policy that would help with things such as mortgage payments, rather than a more expensive universal life insurance program, since they have no dependants.
“It’s an advantage for us in that we’re very clear of the fact we need to plan for this,” said Ms. Underwood.
Even before they’ve turned 40, the two of them have organized wills, power of attorney and health directives in case of a medical emergency.
For her two cents, Ms. Sykes adds that couples with enough disposable income should consider critical illness insurance, an often overlooked form of insurance that pays out a lump-sum for certain illnesses such as late-stage cancer.
Early retirement THE EARLY RETIREES Emily Smith, 38, and Andrew Smith, 37, Calgary Emily Smith describes herself and her husband as people with relatively simple tastes. Sure, they recently went skiing in Montana and purchased a nice car. But they don’t necessarily have the kind of extravagances that she believes people associate with the DINK life.
That’s because they have one lofty goal: early retirement. Ms. Smith, who works in marketing, and Mr. Smith, a project lead at a manufacturing shop, dream of retiring in their mid-50s.
Ms. Smith says the couple automatically puts a third of their paycheques into retirement savings, and they invest even more when they receive bonuses or tax returns. Ms. Smith puts her savings into an RRSP to supplement her workplace’s RRSP contributions. Meanwhile Mr. Smith focuses on his TFSA to keep some funds liquid and to maximize the amount of money they can withdraw tax-free in retirement.
They still have a long runway to retirement, so their investments are fairly high risk and mostly in stocks. They even funnel some money they’re willing to lose into experimenting with cryptocurrencies.
Mike Burns, a certified financial planner with Objective Financial Partners in London, Ont., said the DINKs he’s worked with tend to opt for less risky portfolios, since they’re able to contribute so much more with their disposable income.
“Some DINKs have saved and invested more money than they will need in their lifetime, so sometimes they might say, ‘Well, I have enough invested anyway, why would I deal with more volatility and stress with my investments than I need to?’ ” said Mr. Burns.
On the other hand, he also has child-free clients who, like the Smiths, believe their lifestyle creates an opportunity for riskier investments, since they’re able to ride out a rocky market in their bid for the best returns that can beat inflation.
Of course, the Smiths are also looking for balance. Although they’re working hard to reach that early-retirement goal, Ms. Smith, who lost her mother at a young age, says it’s important that they enjoy life now as well.
They say their child-free life has helped them balance fun with disciplined saving – and they previously struggled to see how they could retire at all if they had children.
The couple used to live in a three-bedroom suburban home, but once they were sure they didn’t want to raise children, they sold it and moved to an upscale condo in downtown Calgary. The condo came at a fairly high price point, and with strata fees, they don’t necessarily save on their monthly costs after moving.
But the couple reaps the benefits of living in a more central location in Calgary, without worrying about all of the effort and time required to maintain a larger home.
Instead, they spend their time with each other, or on their pastimes.
Mr. Smith plays bass guitar and spends lots of time practising and playing local shows with two different bands. Ms. Smith gets satisfaction from the time she spends volunteering to support elderly folks in her community. She says she’s still a maternal person despite not having children, and volunteering is one way she has an outlet for that part of herself.
Sometimes, Ms. Smith admits feeling a little guilty about the quality of life and freedom that being childless has afforded them. But she says that guilt is fully internal – none of her family or friends have ever tried to make her feel that way.
“It’s just part of being part of the world, you can feel guilty about just about anything if you put your mind to it,” said Ms. Smith.

Full text: A short three-hour flight from Vancouver, it’s possible to walk off the plane and glide into vacation mode within minutes – poolside, under the palm trees, surrounded by cactuses, citrus and olive trees, with desert mountains as a backdrop, and enveloped in the popular luxury design movement of the 1950s, a.k.a. Populuxe. It’s as if the past seven decades never happened.
The B.C. connection with Palm Springs, Calif., is a long-standing one, especially for those who took advantage of the plunge in real estate prices during the economic downturn of 2008 and 2009. But Palm Springs had gone through a depressed time before the downturn, and the survival of its large stock of one-level midcentury modern houses was largely a matter of disregard rather than any kind of preservation policy, says Vancouver’s former co-director of planning Larry Beasley, who’s owned a midcentury modern home here since 2011. His home was one of those featured in the annual Modernism Week festival this year. The four-bedroom house was built in 1957 and designed by Albert Belden Crist, who had been designing homes in Hollywood before moving to Palm Springs during the Second World War. Mr. Crist’s designs include an addition to Elvis Presley’s famous Palm Springs home, which sold for US$5.65million a couple of years ago. The house had doubled in price since it was sold in 2020, which tells you something of the relatively recent demand for the midcentury modern gems that had fallen out of fashion as Americans opted for massive suburban mansions instead.
Canadian buyers have played a crucial role in their revival. Billionaire Jim Pattison was one of the first to buy in when he purchased Frank Sinatra’s long-time home in nearby Rancho Mirage in 1995.
The Canadian connection has picked up, buoyed by prices that are relatively affordable compared to B.C. real estate.
“The year we bought our house, our real estate agent told us that 50 per cent of the houses in Palm Springs had been bought by Canadians,” says Mr. Beasley, who divides his time between Palm Springs and Vancouver when he’s not flying around the world. “Our house used to be called the ugly duckling on the block. It was overrun with trees and junk and falling apart.
“Modernism was just being rediscovered. Now, I’m not saying we were among the vanguard or anything. It had been discovered, say, five years prior. But average people had not really discovered it. And so, in our neighbourhood, there were a lot of rundown houses. It was not like you see it now. Nowadays we walk around and it’s hard to find a house that hasn’t been restored.”
These houses, many of them modest but innovative tract homes, have undergone full restorations because there is a market that appreciates them as works of art, says Vancouver realtor Trent Rodney, who took his cues from the Palm Springs modernism revival when he launched his West Coast Modern real estate company locally. Unlike Metro Vancouver, where hundreds of character houses are demolished each year to make way for big houses with walk-in closets and two-sink bathrooms, the houses of Palm Springs are preserved precisely because they hark back to an earlier age. As a result, street after street, neighbourhood after neighbourhood, is filled with one-level ranchers with cactus gardens, painted breezeblock privacy walls and a front door painted baby blue, orange, pink or chartreuse.
“I model our operation on Palm Springs’ success,” says Mr. Rodney. “I see them as 15 years ahead of us. I spent lots of time exploring there in person and researching.”
However, the branding between the desert-escape modernist movement and the west coast movement of the fifties and sixties is different, he says. Palm Springs was the escape for movie stars who wanted glamour and decadence. The modernism of Vancouver is an ode to exposed wood and serenity, with trees, creeks, ocean and waterfalls. A big part of Mr. Rodney’s job is educating the public on the importance of an iconic Barry Downs’s house, for example. Mr. Downs, who died two years ago at the age of 92, had received the Order of Canada in 2015 for his civic contributions, such as Library Square and Canada Place.
Mr. Rodney just listed Mr. Downs’s own home, a spectacular 1,464-square-foot, two-bedroom property at 6664 Marine Dr., perched on a cliff in West Vancouver, for $4.6-million.
Many mid-century modern homes on the north shore have been lost to demolition, purchased by buyers who only saw lot value. The homes are typically small compared to today’s standards. That smallness doesn’t seem to matter to the homeowners in Palm Springs. The town is a sea of one-level homes that are the result of old local building restrictions that didn’t allow anything higher than a one-level plan. Those regulations spawned the iconic Richard Neutra Kaufmann Desert House, considered a mid-century modern masterpiece.
Mr. Rodney says it’s been “an uphill battle,” but slowly the Vancouver region is acquiring a market that understands the intrinsic value of the homes built in that era. He’s found enough buyers who understand the importance of designs by Barry Downs, Arthur Erickson, Ron Thom, Fred Hollingsworth, Bob Lewis, Ned Pratt and B.C. Binning to command top dollar for the house itself, not just the land. Whether they designed innovative tract housing or ultraluxury homes hanging over cliff tops, the buyers are restoring them with modern mechanical updates but maintaining the designs. He recently sold an early James K.M.
Cheng home and the owners immediately spent $1-million on updates, because they understood the value of the house itself.
“People are acquiring real estate holdings the way you acquire works of art,” Mr. Rodney says.
Vancouver heritage consultant and architect Donald Luxton attended the Palm Springs Modernism Week this year and he said there are some legal protections of significant homes and commercial buildings, both by the city and the national register.
But the incentives go beyond the tax credits that are on offer for preserving the buildings.
“Many of them are viable because the prestige value ensures significant buildings are rarely torn down,” says Mr. Luxton.
“They have high market value because people understand the value of the architecture. Buildings by famous architects for famous people are worth a lot of money. … So, it’s really a network that has grown over time – committed owners, effective advocates, preservation tax incentives, political support and a real estate market that trades on prestige. It’s a winning combination.”
Mr. Beasley said another factor has been the involvement of the gay community, which early on was active in restoring and preserving the homes. Ron Willison, who’s lived in Palm Springs for 40 years and works in group sales and events for property management company Natural Retreats, concurs that the gay community, looking to get away from discrimination, had a major impact on the preservation of the homes.
“The cities really had no impact on preserving the properties,” he said.
A big part of the appeal for Canadians is that they can own a home in Palm Springs and rent it out when they aren’t there. That made it possible for Mr. Beasley to maintain a home there. Even Sinatra’s first house in the movie colony neighbourhood is available for rent.
Real estate developer Olga Ilrich, former MLA and the founder of Suncor Developments, has owned a home in Palm Desert since 2016, in a gated community.
She doesn’t rent her place out, but she considers it a sound investment and a convenient escape. Before that, she was renting places in Palm Springs, but she discovered that it’s cheaper to own. Also, because she thinks like a person who works in real estate, she might pay taxes, homeowners association fees, and other costs on the property, but when she sells, she knows she will get a return on her purchase.
“We hang out with other Canadians down there,” says Ms. Ilich.
“People who go down there, they will say, ‘are you going to be in the desert?’ We get together, and down there they are more relaxed. I came home a month ago, and I will go down again next month.
“A lot of people buy a bunch of flights, maybe starting in October and November, and plan that whole time out and they go back and forth.”

Full text: THE LISTING A Toronto real estate listing with fantastical renderings generated by artificial intelligence has raised questions about what the limits are for digital photo manipulation.
“I’ve been searching for properties for quite some time and I was thinking that’s a nice spot,” said Josh Kellendonk, a software developer living in Alberta who uses Realtor.ca as he plans a move to Toronto. “Then second picture hits you in the face, and it’s just a dirty garage at the end of the day.”
The building for sale at 194R Chatham Ave. in Toronto is a single-storey 46- by- 40-foot brick garage on a laneway between Chatham and Danforth avenues, just off the parking lot for Trull Funeral Home and Cremation Centre.
There were 21 photos in the original listing (asking price $588,000): six show the actual building in its current state of bare brick and wood under pealing paint, and 15 show elaborate renderings generated by AI.
The AI images of the Chatham garage are a mix: Some depict the nearly windowless garage with its dirty concrete floors polished to a high gloss and laid out as a large one-bedroom loft with large windows. Some images invent new spaces – pushing out the walls to create nooks for furniture – others replace wooden rafters with steel beams and frankly an absurd amount of duct-work.
“It’s got all the problems all AIgenerated images have. And there’s the subtle mistakes; areas in those photos where the internal dimensions of the building are completely wrong,” said Mr. Kellendonk, who filed a complaint with industry regulator the Real Estate Council of Ontario (RECO) over what he calls the misleading images. “The root of my complaint: it’s utterly divorced from reality.”
The images take the trend of virtual staging – where computer generated furniture and fixtures are added to real estate photos of empty rooms – to a new level.
“As pertains to Chatham, I knew folks would not be able to visualize the space,” said listing agent Robert Francis, a 12-year veteran with Re/Max Hallmark Realty Ltd. who posted the listing.
He couldn’t recall the name of the AI platform used to create the images, but did say he had paid for a subscription to the service and he’s used AI in the past to generate virtual staging options for clients who were building new homes to help showcase potential finishes. He does traditional staging as well, where actual furniture is moved into a space and photos are taken, but cites the virtual tools as a cost-effective way to get across possibilities to clients.
As to Mr. Kellendonk’s complaint, the issue is when does “virtual” start to become misleading?
“There are no national rules with respect to photos and AI.
Local boards may have MLS System rules for this, but at this time, there is no national rule or policy regarding the use of AI in property listings,” said Pierre Leduc, media relations lead with the Canadian Association of Realtors which maintains Realtor.ca.
In Ontario, all registered real estate professionals must abide by the code of ethics defined under the Trust in Real Estate Services Act (TRESA) and also any code of conduct for their local boards.
The regulations for TRESA include that “a registrant … shall make best efforts to ensure that any representations are accurate and; shall not engage in or be a party to misrepresentation or any unethical practice.”
The interpretation of that language is often left up to the individual.
“I’m not aware of any rule book. We just use common sense,” said Yuriy Setko, a realtor who runs BigPicture360, a Toronto service that does traditional real estate photography and videos as well as virtual tours and virtual staging. He’s happy to edit pictures to remove things such as recent steam-cleaning marks in a carpet, or to virtually erase trash bins from the front of a house because pictures were taken on garbage day, but there are limits to what he’ll edit out.
“When we are asked to remove a condo from a window, we refuse.
What if people come and they say: ‘There’s a condo … there was a clear sky in the picture what is going on?’ You’ve got to stay way off from misrepresenting the property,” he said.
RECO did not respond to questions about the complaint, but on the topic of virtual staging it offered this statement: “RECO advises that buyers and their agents should always show due diligence by viewing properties for verification. Where some images have been enhanced to give a buyer a sense of the art of the possible with the space, then that should be specified in the listing by the brokerage or agent.”
Not every listing on Realtor.ca with virtual staging images includes public warnings of the presence of digitally enhanced photos, though Mr. Francis did include a warning in the text of his listing: “Please note that some photos depict conceptual ideas, not actual representations.”
But for some in the virtual staging industry, a text warning may be insufficient for more extensive renderings.
“There’s a lot of rising demand and somewhat of a learning curve as people are adopting it,” said James Dylan Lloyd, business development manager of BellaStaging.ca based in of Vancouver.
“This one in particular the best example of the furthest end of the spectrum.”
Mr. Lloyd said Bella watermarks any image it substantially alters, and while it has experimented with AI the technology’s drawbacks mean the company prefers to stick with its team of human editors and designers.
“Some of the issues we faced is it will completely cover up aspects of the home: It will change power outlets, it will change the outdoors,” putting a blue sky in a window when there’s a heavy bush in reality, Mr. Lloyd said.
“The concern with using AI is you don’t have much control: You can’t change certain outputs, so in essence each time it creates an entirely new image.”
The Chatham listing also has images that show more of a commercial space, like a restaurant layout (despite the garage being zoned residential only) and others that redraw the exterior to suggest a huge brick building sitting on top of the existing structure.
Mr. Francis made clear in an interview with The Globe and Mail that those are only possible uses, though not currently permitted.
“This site could build to a 10metre height,” he said, though it would have to get permission from the city for that or for a commercial rezoning. “We did take those [exterior] pictures off; We just had a lot of folks calling and asking if it was part of a larger structure. We stayed away from that misrepresentation.”
Mr. Kellendork works with AI tools and isn’t suggesting it should be banned, but if his disappointment is any guide, there may be an issue of trust when the virtual replaces the actual.
“If all realtors start to do this and all the listings that have this AI tooling on it, the value of the photos on there are going to be absolutely useless,” he said.

Full text: Colleen Frank was 72 years old when she was evicted from the two-bedroom condo she had rented in Chilliwack, B.C., for more than two decades.
Ms. Frank knew everyone in the 37-unit building. For years, she had served as the unofficial superintendent, earning $800 a month for cleaning public spaces and handling maintenance calls.
Together with her government pension benefits, she’d been getting by. Now she was being told that the condo owner’s son urgently needed her apartment.
By the summer of 2022, she’d lost her caretaker job and her home, at a time when rent was rising quickly in almost every Canadian city. “I had nowhere to go,” Ms. Frank said, “And no money to go with.”
One way to rapidly increase the stock of affordable housing needed for low-income Canadians such as Ms. Frank would be to buy up and preserve what already exists, before those homes are lost to an escalating housing market.
After years of lobbying by housing advocates, Canada is now following the lead of other countries that have used this strategy to balance their housing supplies.
On Thursday, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced the creation of a $1.5billion rental protection fund that will provide a combination of loans and grants to help non-profits buy affordable rental apartments when they go up for sale.
That fund is long overdue, affordable housing groups say, because the country is losing lower-cost rental properties – to renovictions, tenant turnover and demolitions – far faster than it can build them.
“It’s a lot more attractive to cut ribbons at new buildings,” said Terry Cooke, the chief executive officer of the Hamilton Community Foundation, one of the groups involved in the lobby effort. “But it’s the classic hole in the bottom of the bucket problem. And if you don’t patch that hole all the new money and new development in the world will not make a material difference.”
According to U.S. research, preserving affordable housing in expensive urban markets can be between 50 and 70 per cent cheaper than the cost of new construction, and non-profit housing operators keep rents lower for the long term. But private real estate sales often move too quickly, and require too much financing, for non-profits to jump in with competitive bids.
The new federal program will deliver $1-billion in loans and $470-million in grants. It is similar to British Columbia’s Rental Protection Fund, which, since it opened applications last summer, has been flooded with interest from both sellers looking to off-load their rental buildings and housing groups wanting to buy.
“We already have 2,000 units in the pipeline,” said Katie Maslechko, chief executive of the fund, which received $500-million from the province and has already provided grants to help non-profits purchase three properties this winter. “It has just blown us away.”
Canada needs 1.7 million more homes that are affordable to households earning below the median income, according to a 2023 report by University of British Columbia housing researchers. And the country is far behind peer nations, such as the Netherlands and Britain, in its supply of subsidized and supportive housing.
Meanwhile, the country’s supply of existing housing available at deeply affordable rents – that is, the $750 a month considered sustainable for families earning $30,000 annually – is vanishing quickly. According to an analysis of census data by housing consultant Steve Pomeroy, a senior research fellow for the Centre for Urban Research and Education at Carleton University, the country has been losing these units at a rate of 11 for every one that was built between 2011 and 2021.
The situation is even more dire in cities such as Winnipeg, where the ratio was 29 deeply affordable rental units lost for every one built in that time. In Hamilton, the ratio was 20 to 1.
The B.C. fund must work quickly, Ms. Maslechko said: there are hundreds of apartment buildings in the province, with thousands of affordable rentals, at risk of being lost because nonprofits don’t have the capital to move fast enough to purchase the properties.
Average rents have risen beyond what many low-income – and even moderate income – Canadians can afford, driven in part by real estate investing, gentrification and a surge in demand from a growing population. Even as the federal government adds billions of new dollars to the country’s $82-billion national housing strategy in advance of the spring budget, it is facing criticism for increasing immigration when affordable housing is in such short supply.
A 2019 Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives study of 795 neighbourhoods across Canada found that only 9 per cent had average one-bedroom apartment rents that were affordable to minimum-wage workers, meaning the costs were no more than 30 per cent of their incomes. The analysis was conducted before the pandemic spiked rents.
With low vacancy rates creating stiff competition for apartments, long-time tenants, such as Ms. Frank, often find themselves with few options when they face eviction. Their low rents simply no longer exist, and wait-lists for subsidized units are now so long that some non-profit housing providers say they have stopped taking names.
“We’re so fixated on adding new supply that we’re blind to existing affordable housing that is lost right before our eyes,” said Brian Doucet, the Canada Research Chair in urban change and social inclusion at the University of Waterloo.
To enable purchases, countries such as France and Finland have long turned to acquisition programs. A New York acquisition fund created 16 years ago has preserved more than 15,000 affordable units in the city, by offering housing providers a total of US$645-million in bridge financing.
In Canada, some cities and provinces have already created their own acquisition strategies.
Montreal, for example, has given the right of first refusal to affordable housing providers when apartment buildings go up for sale, though the providers must match the prices of private real estate deals. Toronto has a $21.5million acquisition program to help non-profits, co-operatives and community land trusts buy rental buildings, on the condition they guarantee affordability for 99 years. And there is also the acquisition fund started by the provincial government in B.C.
An acquisition fund helps non-profits purchase housing units and offer them at rents that are often less than half the going market rate. Those rents then rise more slowly than rents in the private market and become more affordable over time, said Jill Atkey, chief executive officer of the BC Non Profit Housing Association.
When non-profit housing organizations purchase private buildings, the tenants of those buildings get stable housing and are spared the worry of sudden evictions beyond their control, Ms. Atkey added. Two-thirds of evictions in Canada are motivated by landlords who want to sell, use properties for themselves, or perform renovations or repairs, according to an analysis by UBC researchers using Statistics Canada data.
More acquisitions would also help non-profits build capacity, so they have the equity to purchase even more properties and redevelop buildings that have reached the ends of their useful lives, increasing Canada’s depleted low-rent housing stock for the long term. “Collectively, we need to come to an understanding that we had almost zero housing investments in this country for 25 years,” Ms. Atkey said. “And that bill is now due.”
In another example, in Kitchener, Ont., a co-operative of community groups, investors and local government collaborated to buy a 58-unit apartment building that had gone up for sale in the private market. Sean Campbell, the executive director of Union Co-operative, one of the groups involved, said the co-operative committed to maintaining the existing rents in the building, which were already about $500 lower than the city’s going market rent. When tenants do leave, rents can be raised in only 40 per cent of the units. Many of the tenants have lived there for decades, according to Mr. Campbell. “By preserving these units, we are allowing people to stay in their neighbourhoods,” he said.
In addition to the federal fund, Mr. Campbell said there is a role for cities to play. “Municipalities have a long history of buying land to be ready so that when Amazon or Toyota comes knocking, they have the land to do a major employment project,” he said. “What we haven’t seen is acquisition at scale for affordable housing.”
After Ms. Frank was evicted, she lived in a windowless room in her son’s basement before she finally found a secondary suite in a renovated garage. A few months later, her new landlord said his daughter might need the space, possibly requiring Ms. Frank to move for a third time in a year.
“I put on the happy face, but it’s hard,” she said. Living with uncertainty is exhausting. “It’s on your mind all the time. You don’t get a break from it, you know.”
She can’t return to her old building in Chilliwack, even if a place opens up. She hears the units there are now renting for close to $1,800 a month.
Housing has become one of Canada’s most vexing and all-consuming quandaries. This article is part of a Globe and Mail series that examines the country’s affordability crisis, its myriad causes and prospective solutions.

Doctors seek novel remedies as ERs become places of refuge: Physicians say stable housing is best prescription for homeless patients

Full text: After three decades as an emergency physician at Edmonton’s Royal Alexandra Hospital, Louis Hugo Francescutti has come to realize that medicine alone is not health care.
For years now, he has watched an alarming spike in the number of homeless patients coming through his emergency room’s doors. Just as troubling, he says, is that of the nearly 9,000 patients with no fixed address who visited Edmonton emergency rooms last year, many of them wound up sent back to the same illness-inducing circumstances that landed them in the ER in the first place – only to see them return again, sicker.
To break that cycle, last winter, Dr. Francescutti and his colleagues launched a local pilot program that provides transitional housing for patients that would otherwise be discharged from hospital into homelessness. The Bridge Healing Transition Accommodation Program, considered the first of its kind in Canada, provides 36 recovery rooms spread across three buildings in the city’s west end. In the program’s first year, more than 100 people checked into Bridge Healing, staying an average of 45 days each. Many of them have gone onto permanent housing, Dr. Francescutti said.
But even as his team celebrates that success, he acknowledges that it barely begins to address what has become a public-health epidemic faced by physicians at hospitals across the country.
Last year, at only two Toronto emergency rooms – in Toronto Western Hospital and the Toronto General Hospital, both of which are part of the University Health Network (UHN) – the 100 most frequent ER users recorded as having no fixed address made a collective 4,309 visits.
In total, this tiny group – representing 0.12 per cent of all UHN patients – accounted for 3.5 per cent of the year’s ER visits. Twenty-four of these patients made more than 50 visits each, and some came more than 100 times.
For years, these patients have been pejoratively labelled “frequent flyers” – accused of tying up the health care system with unnecessary and gratuitous visits.
But as homelessness rates increase across the country – exacerbated by a mental health and addictions crisis – ERs have become almost an inevitable destination for Canada’s most vulnerable.
Fearing where things are headed, a chorus of doctors are calling for radical change: making the case, to whomever will hear them, that safe, affordable, secure housing is the best prescription for their patients.
Alternative community health care supports have long existed at the grassroots level. But now, physicians and hospitals are also beginning to look for ways to address the root social causes of their patients’ illnesses and injuries. Some are setting up satellite services outside of the health care facilities to provide care near shelters, parks and tent encampments. Others are going so far as to provide housing itself.
In short, physicians are reckoning with what UHN physician Andrew Boozary calls “the heart and soul” of medicine, in a country that prides itself on universal health care. “We can’t really talk about universal health care without housing as a human right.”
Within hospitals, there is a code used to track the prevalence of homelessness among patients, under the World Health Organization’s International Classification of Diseases (ICD).
And while the code – Z59.0 – is mandatory for Canadian hospitals to use, its reliability for statistical purposes varies province to province, and even hospital to hospital. Doctors and nurses are not obligated to ask patients about their housing status, so this information is not always making it onto medical charts in the first place – meaning the picture is incomplete.
This is especially true in the emergency department, where discussions tend to be brief and to the point. Those who come in with what are deemed non-urgent issues, looking for temporary refuge, may not even speak with a doctor.
But missing these people in the data leaves a crucial gap in our understanding of the breadth of this crisis – and impedes a fulsome response.
Tracking the rise of homelessness in Canada, even generally, is a challenge. The term “homelessness” is broad, encompassing everyone from the chronically unhoused and living in tents or on the street, to those staying in a shelter, or couch surfing with family or friends.
As of 2021, Statistics Canada – citing a 2014 study by the Canadian Observatory on Homelessness at York University – estimated that an average of 235,000 people in Canada experience homelessness each year.
Otherwise, homelessness is currently estimated at a national level through “point-in-time” counts, which provide a one-day snapshot in 72 communities across Canada. The most recent count, taken in each city on a single day between 2020 and 2022, found that homelessness as a whole is on the rise – increasing by 20 per cent since the 2018 count. Chronic homelessness (defined as lasting for six or more months) increased by 60 per cent.
Alarmingly, the largest increase – a staggering 88 per cent – was among the truly unsheltered: those sleeping outside in tents or in doorways or abandoned buildings.
These concerning trends prompted Canada’s Federal Housing Advocate to release a report on encampments in February, which called on the federal government to establish a formal national encampments response plan by the end of the summer.
For the first time, the count also gathered data about the health challenges faced by those experiencing homelessness. The vast majority of those surveyed (85 per cent) reported having at least one health challenge, and 67 per cent reported having more than one.
Homelessness, in and of itself, is a major health concern, causing or compounding an endless list of physical and mental illnesses. Hypothermia and frostbite. Burns or chemical inhalations from lighting fires to keep warm. Viruses spread through overcrowded congregate settings. Foot infections worsened by wet socks, illfitting shoes or lack of access to clean water to wash and dress wounds. Chronic pain. Depression, anxiety and psychosis.
Those experiencing homelessness are also disproportionately likely to struggle with drug use and addictions, which in a toxic drug supply crisis too often leads to serious health issues, or death.
At Toronto’s St. Michael’s Hospital, roughly 20 per cent of the patients Carolyn Snider sees in the ER are homeless. And she stresses that even 20 per cent is likely an undercount. Dr. Snider, an emergency physician and scientist with the hospital’s MAP Centre for Urban Health Solutions, co-authored recent studies on the rise of weather-related injuries caused by homelessness, as well as the increase in “non-urgent” ER visits by patients experiencing homelessness during the winter months in Ontario. The research identified a provincewide spike in these visits of 24 per cent in 2022/23. In Toronto alone, they rose by 68 per cent.
The study found that many of the people came into the ER to connect with a social worker to get help finding shelter, Dr. Snider said in a phone interview in February.
“But as one of our outreach workers yesterday said, she hasn’t been able to get anyone connected into a shelter since late October, early November.”
As a result, Dr. Snider – who recently completed her tenure as chief of emergency medicine at the hospital – said they routinely have to tell people who are unhoused that there are no beds available. No chairs for them, even, sometimes. That the hospital simply won’t be able to help them. She knows this means they will likely wind up back in the same circumstances that brought them there, trapped in an escalating cycle of poor health.
“And it’s an awful, awful feeling,” she said.
Particularly in the harshest winter months – when homeless shelters and warming centres are full, when public bathrooms are locked, and when people are shuffled out of coffee shops and malls – ERs become the last refuge for a growing number of people who are simply desperate to keep warm or dry.
Stephen Hwang, director of the MAP Centre, stresses that just because a patient’s visit is technically classified as non-urgent, does not mean that their presence in hospital is unnecessary.
“Frankly, coming there because you’re really cold and there’s no place for you to go actually makes perfect sense,” he said.
“If you were on the street and you were freezing, and everything was closed, and the only place you could go was into the emergency department, we would all march into the emergency department and say, ‘I need to warm up.’ And it’s so it really is not unnecessary, it’s just unfortunate.”
On an evening in February, Dr.
Francescutti had a homeless patient come in with major swelling in his leg. The man’s other leg had already been amputated because of a severe burn, and his remaining leg was “weeping,” with fluid leaking out of a wound.
“How in hell is he supposed to take care of that when he’s got mobility issues? He’s got pain, it’s infected, he’s about to go septic,” Dr. Francescutti said. “And so that’s the kind of patient that – why are we surprised that he keeps coming back to emergency?” Scenes like this, playing out daily in ERs across the country, are the consequence of what experts say boils down to an absence of adequate affordable housing and social supports.
Tim Richter, executive director of the Canadian Alliance to End Homelessness, said that without those things – and in a very expensive real estate and rental market – people who can’t compete are being forced out the bottom.
“They tend to be people that have already had some trauma in their lives, or come from child welfare, or some other public system.
They’re struggling with addiction.
They’re struggling with health issues. They have a disability, a brain injury, a developmental disability,” Mr. Richter said, adding that many of the same people who wind up in hospital again and again may similarly end up in and out of jail.
A Globe and Mail analysis last fall found that one in five inmates released from Ontario jails are discharged into homelessness – a similarly futile cycle that only fuels the crisis.
“So we end up allowing people to cycle aimlessly between all of these very expensive public systems, because we don’t address their housing need,” Mr. Richter said. “They then become the problem of health care or corrections or whatever.”
For the doctors that treat these patients, the moral injury or psychological distress from the system’s failings is taking a toll.
At St. Michael’s Hospital in downtown Toronto, Sahil Gupta said the futility of these encounters can breed desensitization.
The patients are often frustrated, he said. They haven’t slept.
They’re on edge. “And then we say we’re one more person that can’t help – ‘Here’s a pamphlet of resources,’ and so on. You know, that’s really injurious both for us … and it leads to aggressions and challenges sometimes that creates further desensitization, and it becomes this downward spiral in some ways.”
Doctors are not the only frontline health care workers feeling the toll of the housing crisis.
As an in-patient social worker at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto, a primary part of Sarah Morgan’s role is to help patients to transition out of the hospital once they are stabilized.
But more often than not, she said her patients – who have complex and often layered needs – are coming in homeless. And supportive housing options are virtually non-existent.
“People don’t have anywhere to go. And we know just through the social determinants of health, one of the biggest keys to success is people having somewhere safe for them to recover,” she said.
“How as health care providers are we to expect our patients to show up to appointments, to take their medications, to stay out of hospital and essentially to fend for themselves, if we’re not able to provide those basic human needs? It’s unreasonable.”
It pains her to sit across from a patient or their family, and tell them that the supports they need simply don’t exist. That they are just stuck in the hospital – sometimes for months or years. “You’re the face of a system that is broken,” she said.
When they do find somebody housing, she said the transformation is magical. But even in those cases – which she said are the exception, not the rule – there is a lineup of people behind them waiting for that spot in the hospital.
“There’s this constant turnover when somebody’s being discharged, we already have a name for who’s coming next. It’s just a constant flow,” she said.
In Dr. Francescutti’s view, the current system is an unconscionable failing. He questions why it is legal to discharge patients into nothing, even challenging Accreditation Canada – which sets national standards for hospital performance – to bar health care facilities from doing so.
“Treating them and streeting them – putting them back on the street – doesn’t help anyone,” he said.
“If there was any other patient that we ever thought we’d be sending home at increased risk of death, we’d be concerned. But for homeless patients, we don’t – and the reason is we’ve become habituated.”
Discussions around whether people should be offered supportive housing in order to keep them out of the ERs, and out of the health care system in general, often revolve around a goal of cutting costs. But experts argue we should be looking instead at how to spend in a less wasteful way – and in a way that’s more compassionate.
At Home/Chez Soi, a yearslong study of homelessness and mental illness led by the Mental Health Commission of Canada, found that “housing first” – an approach that focuses on moving homeless people into permanent housing and then providing additional supports and services as needed – is proven to keep people housed long-term.
And though they found that this approach does not necessarily lead to overwhelming cost savings in the short or medium term, it does lead to a more appropriate allocation of funds.
Instead of pointlessly shuffling people between shelters and jails and hospitals, housing people can help to stabilize them and connect them with the continuing supports they need.
“We need multifactorial, multipronged efforts in terms of prevention of homelessness,” said Erik Latimer, a McGill University psychiatry professor and the study’s main author. “Maybe we’ll spend somewhat more money, but it will be to deliver a much smarter set of services for people, and people will be much better off as a result.”
For the most part, the study found that in-patient and emergency service use fell, particularly among higher-needs participants. But he also gave the example of one participant who actually wound up “costing” more money after he became housed, but only because through a support worker it came to light that he had Hepatitis C, and he was admitted to hospital for two cycles of treatment.
Had he not entered the program, it would’ve been cheaper, but he likely would be no longer alive. “The Hepatitis C would have eventually destroyed his liver and he would have died,” Dr. Latimer said.
In the long term, he says the Housing First model very likely has the potential for savings – though there is a lack of research tracking anyone long enough to know for sure. (The At Home/ Chez Soi study, for example, only followed people for two years.)
Either way, he said the approach must not be looked at as something simply meant to save money, but as something meant to save lives.
“It’s more humane,” he said simply. “What kind of society do we want to live in?” As the Bridge Healing program in Edmonton reached its one-year anniversary, the province’s Premier has been vocal in her support, and Alberta Health Services has fast-tracked funding.
The program is also rapidly expanding, having already secured five more lots and eyeing six more – each of which will house an additional 12-unit modular building by the end of this year.
“So we are aiming at another 132 this year and probably the same next year – till we have the capacity to meet the needs of every homeless patient that wants a fresh start in life,” Dr. Francescutti said in an e-mail.
In Victoria, the non-profit Cool Aid Society has provided housing, health care and social supports for people experiencing homelessness and poverty since the 1970s; today, this includes both health and dental clinics as well as emergency shelters and transitional and supportive housing across 20 locations in the city.
As the backlog for housing grows in the province, those who work at the Cool Aid Society say the idea of “transitional” housing is becoming unrealistic. Even at their emergency shelters, they have long since abandoned their 30-day stay limitations, as people can now end up staying years.
“It’s not possible just to check people out,” said Marion Selfridge, research manager with the organization’s community health centre.
They have similarly adapted their health care approach from an exclusively bricks-and-mortar model to one that meets people where they are at. In the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, as social services shut down across the country, the organization established the Cool Aid Mobile InnerCity Outreach (CAMICO) team, to bring health care to people at temporary shelter sites set up at hotels and motels in the city.
Between May and September 2020, they provided more than 9,823 visits to 414 clients, many of whom have substance use disorders or chronic mental illness.
The health benefits for the patients were obvious. Doctors were identifying issues much earlier, and helping people with wound care and prescriptions, and even transportation to appointments Andrew Boozary leads a new stabilization clinic near Toronto Western Hospital where patients who may have overdosed can be brought directly.

that might have otherwise been missed.
But in an evaluation of that program, Ms. Selfridge said they also discovered a broader system benefit: ER visits by these patients were way down.
Today, the organization’s health program – which now also visits designated encampment sites in the city – has roughly 20 doctors and 17 nurses on their team, and in the past year facilitated about 60,000 patient visits.
Over the past three years, they’ve seen roughly 7,300 individual patients.
But without a radical increase in affordable housing, Ms. Selfridge said their efforts only go so far to break the cycle.
“You can do as much primary care as you want. But if you don’t have places for people to go that work for them, it’s such a struggle,” she said.
Back in Toronto, Dr. Boozary and his UHN colleagues are also looking outside the traditional structures of medicine for innovative solutions.
Dr. Boozary leads a new stabilization clinic, opened in December, 2022, where paramedics can bring intoxicated people – most of whom are homeless – to sober up.
In addition to an on-call doctor, the clinic is staffed by peer support workers with lived experience who can help connect patients with social services when they are ready.
The program is win-win: they provide people with more relevant care, and are able to drastically cut ambulance offload times and free up ER beds.
And construction on an even more ambitious project is under way: a four-storey modular apartment building is expected to open this summer, providing 51 units to permanently house patients within the UHN system who are, or are at risk of becoming, homeless – with a focus on seniors, women, and Indigenous and racialized people.
In the most recent point-intime count, 31 per cent of people experiencing homelessness identified as Indigenous – a stark overrepresentation, considering census data shows only 5 per cent of people in Canada identify as Indigenous.
The housing project represents a meshing of worlds – health and housing – that have traditionally been treated as separate in Canada, funded and handled by different government ministries.
Indeed, for a long time, physicians who advocated for housing and social justice were told to stay in their lane.
“The reality is that is very firmly in our lane, because the only other options for people are to come back to the hospital or try to seek other health care supports,” Dr. Boozary said.
In Dr. Boozary’s view, the health care system requires a complete rethink, rather than simply “tinkering around the margins.”
“I really feel that we are at this real battle for both the heart and soul of medicine, around where this discipline needs to be able to move.”
For Dr. Hwang – one of the world’s leading researchers on homelessness, housing and health – it’s bittersweet, after decades of sounding the alarm, to finally see these problems tackled as one interconnected issue.
“What was once kind of a fringe, unusual kind of position to take has now become much more common, and actually much more, I guess, recognized as common sense,” Dr. Hwang said. “So I think things have changed, but you know, we’ve still got a long way to go.”

Full text: Save for the odd scrubby weed poking through the asphalt, there’s scant evidence of any plant life around this 1905 warehouse in downtown L.A. But this wasn’t always the case.
“There used to be a vineyard here,” says Los Angeles River Wine Co.’s Abe Schoener, as he walks through his winemaking facility/tasting room/library/DJ booth.
A block to the east is the concrete aqueduct built in 1938 to contain the Los Angeles River, to the west is a large scrap metal yard and directly in front sit the still-in-use railway tracks, whose arrival more than 100 years ago spelled the start of the decline of the area’s once thriving winemaking scene.
But Schoener and a few other dedicated winemakers are committed to bringing the area back into the vinous limelight again.
The conventional wisdom is that California’s winemaking birth occurred in the Napa and Sonoma valleys north of San Francisco. But at the turn of the last century if you asked for California wine, you’d be almost assuredly served something not from Napa but L.A.
The oldest vines in the state are scraggly cuttings dating back to 1774 from the historic Mission San Gabriel, just east of downtown L.A. These are the workhorse mission grapes, brought to the coast by Catholic New World missionaries from Spain. Then, in 1833 an auspiciouslynamed settler, Jean-Louis Vignes, imported (although smuggled might be more accurate) the inaugural vitis vinifera – cabernet franc and sauvignon blanc – from his native France and planted them on a 100-acre plot on the banks of the then untamed Los Angeles River.
By mid-19th century, the area had more than 100 vineyards producing 25 millions bottles of wine annually – roughly the same amount Ontario produces now. But the factors that helped grow this industry – sun, water – also drew legions of settlers, whose desire for houses ultimately put these local vineyards on the endangered list.
The remnants of this era can still be found at the San Antonio Winery on the east bank of the river, just north of Schoener’s boîte. When Italian immigrant Santo Cambianica opened the winery in 1917, local winemaking was still good business and even the Prohibition didn’t derail its growth (thank you, church wine).
But the steady decrease in grape acreage resulting from the city’s growth meant that while the wine could still be made in L.A., the grapes would increasingly come from points north.
The still family-run San Antonio Winery has expanded exponentially from its original footprint – the facility stretches over several blocks and now they make wine under 13 different labels – though sadly none feature local grapes but those from their vineyards planted upstate in Paso Robles and Monterey. But their tasting room, restaurant and wine shop are a time machine back to what the industry was like in its heyday and a good spot to nibble olives and eat prosciutto where vineyards once flourished.
If San Antonio is a connection to the region’s past, Jasper Dickson and Amy Luftig’s Angeleno Wine Co. just a few blocks north, represents the future. When the pair received their winery licence in 2019, it was the first to be granted in L.A. since San Antonio received theirs 102 years prior.
Dickson had been working at Silverlake Wine when he got the chance to work with famed grower Juan Alonso, whose vineyard in nearby Santa Clarita provided him with a small allotment of tannat grapes.
One experimental vintage followed another until Dickson paired up with Luftig to open their small tasting room and production facility around the corner from David Chang’s Majordomo in a cool spot just east of Chinatown.
It’s a far cry from San Antonio’s industrial might – Angeleno picks all their own grapes because L.A. doesn’t have the numbers to support dedicated picking crews – but they now make more than a dozen wines including zinfandel, albarino and sparkling for their growing local fan base.
Everything in their retro squat bottles is grown in Los Angeles County. The place still has a start up feel, with clientele Doordashing food from downtown L.A. hot spots to weekend tastings at the winery.
But as momentous as the opening of Angeleno was, for wine nerds, it paled in comparison to the news that Schoener, a former classics prof (and University of Toronto alum) and one of the seminal participants in the Northern California wine renaissance of the early aughts, was relocating to the south. And further, that his partner in the new Los Angeles River Wine Co. would be Rajat Parr, arguably the most famous sommelier in the world before he started the cult California labels Sandhi and Domaine de La Côte.
The new company would follow a similar ethos to Schoener’s Napa-based label, the Scholium Project, with an intense focus on locating heritage vines, a low intervention approach to winemaking and a desire to take risks in pursuit of wine nirvana.
Schoener has become sort of a wine Indiana Jones – traversing the back roads of the region looking for gnarled old discoveries and convincing owners of these forgotten vines that he can bring them back to glory.
To that end, he’s secured access to rare plots of mission, palomino and zinfandel grapes, which were often planted before the Titanic sank and have likely never seen pesticides or had commercial irrigation. For wine lovers, these grapes are like coming across a Jackson Pollock at a yard sale.
And the wine that comes from these survivors is unlike anything else being produced in America – perfumed, genredefying, deft in structure. They’re a history lesson as much as a drink, a gateway to a forgotten L.A. that may soon have its long overdue second act.
HOW TO VISIT San Antonio Winery is open daily for lunch and tastings. Angeleno Wine Co. is open Saturday and Sunday – they don’t serve food so encourage you to bring a picnic (or order from Majordomo around the corner). Los Angeles River Wine Co. is open by appointment and holds frequent tasting/seminars booked through Tock.
STAY: Both the past and the future of the L.A. wine scene are centred close to downtown and the new Frank Gehry-designed Conrad Hilton on South Grand Avenue is at the quiet north end, which offers easy and quick access to all three wineries without having to hop on any of the notorious freeways.
RESTAURANTS THAT SERVE L.A. WINE: Bar Covell is a cool wine-forward hangout in the Loz Feliz neighbourhood that’s been a long supporter of the local scene. 4628 Hollywood Blvd.; barcovell.com Dunsmoor is an airy spot north of downtown with an attached wine bar that loves Abe Schoener’s wines. 3501 Eagle Rock Blvd.; dunsmoor.la Providence is a much lauded Hollywood power spot and always saves space for a few local bottles on their impressive list. 5955 Melrose Ave.; providencela.com L.A. WINES TO BRING HOME: In addition to L.A. River and Angeleno here are three winemakers with no tasting rooms that produce local bottles.

How foreign money can help us meet our housing goals: While overseas investors get blamed for market costs, condo towers often need their money

Full text: Vancouver real estate experts argue that foreign money can play a role in the creation of affordable rental housing units. They say government policies aimed at curbing foreign investment are serving to stem the funding necessary to get new housing built – and the affordable units that could be part of the equation.
But first we must get real about the extent of foreign capital, says Andy Yan, director of Simon Fraser University’s City Program and an associate professor.
While 4.3 per cent has been used to describe the percentage of residential properties owned by non-residents in Metro Vancouver, it’s a heavily diluted and misleading figure, Prof. Yan says. It reflects all types of housing that had been built in previous decades, purchased by non-residents at a regionwide level.
For a more accurate picture, he has updated the latest data from the Canadian Housing Statistics Program (CHSP) by municipality, property type and period of construction, owned by non-residents. Because investors are active in the new condo market, he looked at condos built between 2016 and 2021, based on CHSP data released in 2023.
In Metro Vancouver, non-resident ownership of new condos is at 11.7 per cent, or roughly, one in 10 people, he says. That’s more than double the number usually cited, and a far more realistic reflection of the foreign capital situation, he says.
In the city of Vancouver, 13.5 per cent of those condos were purchased by people who reside outside the country, who may or may not hold a Canadian passport.
In the city of Richmond, B.C., it’s 16.2 per cent; in Burnaby, B.C., it’s 12.7 per cent.
“Over one in 10 people who buy a newly built condo don’t live in Canada,” says Prof. Yan, who gets frustrated with misleading data around such an important housing policy topic.
“It’s not that all foreign buying is bad, but it can and should be directed. It shouldn’t be a free-forall that can cause displacement but should reflect the priorities of housing full-time residents.
That’s important in a region where local incomes have historically been lacklustre and the economy capital poor,” he says.
“We should learn from other countries like Australia and Singapore, this idea that it’s better to direct foreign capital than just ignore it. So much of the conversation has been about how to measure it. And we know foreign buying and capital is there, so what do we do about it? Some people want to ban it, and that’s one response.
The other is, direct it. You could direct it, for example, through a housing investment bond to fund affordable housing projects, instead of fuelling a speculative real estate market.
“My point is the issue of foreign capital is a conversation we need to have instead of denying it exists.”
About half of all new condos in Vancouver are investor-owned.
For the private developer, the foreign investor may play a key role in providing inclusionary housing, which is the policy term for providing a portion of belowmarket housing in exchange for more density. Metro Vancouver recently released a report that showed policies for inclusionary housing have had some success, resulting in 9,200 below-market homes, either completed or approved, aimed at moderate incomes. The number is an estimate, because projects can be cancelled and change. The percentage of the building designated inclusionary, and the incentives given to the developer to build the units, depend on the municipality. According to the report, higher priced markets can support inclusionary housing of 10 per cent or 20 per cent, but lower priced markets would have a tough time making it pencil out.
The policy is dependent on market-rate condo sales.
“Development will continue to occur under inclusionary housing if the revenues for the market-rate units are high enough to cover the lost value from including affordable housing units in the project,” the report said. “Because the success of an inclusionary housing policy depends on market-rate development, these policies only work when new development is occurring.”
The province is currently reviewing the idea of making inclusionary housing mandatory instead of voluntary. While laudable, Prof. Yan argues that the definition of affordable doesn’t necessarily translate into affordable for a lot of people.
For example, the current Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp.
definition used by the City of Vancouver is 20 per cent below the city-wide average rent.
“That may mean something to households with high incomes, but on the east side of the city, with lower rents, it can actually mean that rents go up, and there’s tenant displacement, because it’s a citywide average.”
As well, private development depends on market cycles, and housing only gets built on the upswing. To get a high-rise project built, developers need to obtain financing by selling enough presale units within a 12-month period. That’s where investors and foreign money play a key role, says Tony Letvinchuk, managing director, Macdonald Commercial Real Estate. Mr. Letvinchuk says those inclusionary housing units would have been built during “the heyday” of development, when the numbers made sense. He argues that foreign capital helps provide the financing needed to build condominium towers throughout the region. Those towers are most often the source of below-market housing units because if market conditions are favourable, the developer can make them work. That’s where foreign investors come in.
Several years ago, in response to an overheated market and foreign purchases, the province brought in the foreign buyer tax, as it was known. Two years ago, the federal government introduced a foreign buyer ban, and recently extended it.
“The levels of government and the central bank are trying to do the right thing for the issues facing the public and for the financial stability of the country, but at the same time some of these policies work against the stated goals for housing supply,” Mr. Letvinchuk says.
“We had that bulge over 2017, 2018 and 2019 and presales were very strong and the core of that often came from what might be described as foreign capital for a home in our marketplace, and those presales actually contributed to a rather large degree to getting projects off the ground.”
That made the bottom line workable, he says, which allowed for a mix of housing options such as the city of Vancouver’s inclusionary housing policy to include 20 per cent below-market units.
“Now they are looking like brilliant deals, because you couldn’t do that today given the current interest-rate environment and the cost to build,” he says. “We don’t want to be negative, but that was the heyday, in the past decade, for getting housing built when financing was at rock bottom and construction prices, at 30 and 40 per cent of what they are today.”
Another fact of privately built housing is that it caters to investor demands, which may not be the same type of housing needed by working locals with families and lower incomes. Developer and real estate consultant Michael Geller has argued in favour of government-mandated policy for larger, family-friendly units.
Mark Goodman and Ian Brackett, brokers at Vancouver-based Goodman Commercial, say that investors are attracted to concrete towers and “bare bones” units that can command top rents. Concrete towers take years to build, and investors can afford to wait because by the time of completion the unit will have likely gone up in value.
“If you are someone who actually needs to live in a unit, not many people can plan five years from now, whereas an investor can be more patient, put down a deposit, wait, get the unit, and then hopefully the price has gone up in that time,” Mr. Brackett says.
“These presales are the lubricant for the developer,” Mr. Goodman adds. “They finance the projects, and because you don’t have that, it translates to less housing, which translates to less units that add to the rental pool plus affordable rental components, and one could opine the net effect is negative for the country.”

Commotion in Point Grey over what will replace grocery store: Development plans have some residents worried about density and housing mix

Full text: Major developments, such as big box grocery stores, can make or break a neighbourhood. If they disappear, they can throw a neighbourhood off balance. Vancouverites saw that happen when the iconic Woodward’s department store shuttered its downtown location.
For decades, a Safeway store had anchored Vancouver’s Point Grey Village retail district at 4545 West 10th Ave., but in 2018 the three-acre site was sold off and the store demolished. It has been a vacant lot ever since, awaiting redevelopment by the new owner, international development and investment company BentallGreenOak. Whatever happens at that site will be crucial to restoring vitality to the neighbourhood.
After Safeway left, more shops moved out and much of the street stayed empty, resulting in a current retail vacancy rate in the area of 14.3 per cent, far higher than the 7 per cent or 8 per cent considered healthy.
Reasons for the emptying out of high streets are similar in most urban centres: property tax increases, competition from e-commerce and high real estate values.
Point Grey Village has the added complication of a decreased population and competition from nearby University of B.C.’s newer shopping district. With increased property values, it also generally started to make more sense for landowners in urban centres to hold onto empty stores as assets rather than tie them up with businesses that could afford the rents.
A city-commissioned study of six Vancouver retail districts between 2012 and 2019 showed a 71per-cent increase in property ownership by developers and numbered companies and a 29per-cent decrease in individual ownership. There was also a 40per-cent increase in vacancies over several years, and this was prepandemic.
Resident Jean Baird can recite a long list of shops that have cleared out in the past few years, including a Vancity branch and theatre. Her group, Friends of Point Grey Village, is advocating for the former Safeway site to live up to city policies for a livable, villagefriendly development, rich with public amenities that would reinvigorate the street and fill the empty spaces and add a more interesting retail component.
Ms. Baird dreams of an outdoor space that takes inspiration from Toronto’s successful Berczy Park or Love Park, which have whimsical water features and ample public seating, as well as a mix of housing types, including rental, condos and co-ops, to fulfill the needs of renters and downsizers who want to stay in the neighbourhood.
However, the developer has different plans: a large high-rise all-rental complex that consists of a 17-storey and 19-storey tower with six-storey podium fronting 10th Avenue, two six-storey buildings to the north of the site and a 37,000-square-foot grocery store that fronts the ground level. Of the 569 units, 114 units are at rents that are 20 per cent below the citywide average – part of the Moderate-Income Rental Housing Pilot Program. Units include 327 one-bedroom units, 29 studios, 174 two-bedrooms and 39 three-bedroom units.
The rezoning proposal does not include child care, and the public outdoor area is between two buildings that appears to be partly in shadow in the animation posted on the City of Vancouver’s Shape Your City website. The large development also appears to have little setback from the street, although BGO disagrees.
Residents argue that it’s an imposing, generic, fortress-like design without enough public amenities. The Urban Design Panel, which advises city staff, also had criticisms about the design.
“There is deep, deep concern in the community,” says Ms. Baird, who founded Friends for Point Grey Village with other residents four years ago. “The potential for that Safeway site is enormous as far as revitalizing the community – but with what is currently on the table, that opportunity is being squandered.”
The developer is asking for considerably more density than the current zoning allows, which is up to six storeys of rental plus a floor of retail space. Under the MIRHPP, up to 14 storeys is allowed, but only at a major intersection.
Vancouver needs livable neighbourhood centres, particularly if it’s going to achieve the vision set out in the citywide Vancouver Plan, says Christina DeMarco, former city of Vancouver senior planner and former head planner for Metro Vancouver.
She’s also a local resident of Point Grey and member of Friends of Point Grey Village, and she says the proposal falls short of several city policies and concerns.
For example, city policy requires some form of public park space for large developments.
The Vancouver Plan calls for village-like shopping centres. As well, last year the city acknowledged a shortfall of at least 15,000 licensed child-care spaces.
The trade-off for giving the developer significantly more density should be more community amenities, says Ms. DeMarco. Last year, city council reduced the subsidy required by the developer for the below-market units. That should mean there is more money available for child care or a public library, or to simply reduce the density on site so it’s more in keeping with the village scale. Also, she argues that a massive store that takes up the entire ground level is old-fashioned and monotonous.
As is, she says, the proposal feels more like a financial undertaking than the heart of a community.
“We had this wonderful image of how the three acres would transform the village,” says Ms. DeMarco.
“We had always dreamed of a housing mix, because we knew the uplift from condos, in particular, creates all kinds of community amenity. So, condos for empty nesters who want to own; rental for a variety of people; and coops that are below market, and lots of amenities.”
The city responded by e-mail that the applicant did not add child care to its proposal, and it had not been a requirement.
“Staff are aware of both neighbourhood and city-wide demand for child care facilities, and will review the financial performance of this project, to determine if the project can support any additional public amenities beyond the provision of below-market rental housing units,” said the city response.
City staff will also be reviewing height, density, the overall form of the proposal, the public plaza, impact on neighbours and contribution to retail and affordable housing, the spokesperson said.
Retail expert and planner Lewis Silberberg has been inventorying Vancouver neighbourhoods for more than 20 years. He initiated the city’s work on storefront vacancy rates and contributed to the retail study.
To “reposition” West 10th Ave.
as a thriving neighbourhood, he’d consider future development in nearby Jericho Lands, at UBC, as well as the impact of future rapid transit and the future population growth. He says the grocery store anchor will be key because interesting, successful neighbourhoods have a hierarchy of retail.
“There is a hierarchy of uses in terms of tenant mix that contributes to the health and vitality and if you look at the top of the pyramid, it’s the retail grocery store or equivalent,” he says.
Not all major grocers are the same, and a unique grocer anchor at the BGO site could draw shoppers from outside the area, he says. And that grocer also has the potential to compete with smaller retailers or complement them, which is key.
BGO vice-president, development, David Roche, responded in an e-mail that the plaza will be 6,000 square feet and include three retail shops, with landscaping. The building setback will exceed the city requirements and will allow for public seating. He couldn’t yet say the anchor grocery tenant, but he said they’d received significant interest from many retailers.
“This development will have the effect of stitching the neighbourhood together architecturally and socially to enhance this entire neighbourhood block and to complete the existing community,” said Mr. Roche.
“Our team’s hope is that the grocery will serve not only the roughly 1,000 new residents that will live in this development, but that it will attract neighbours throughout Point Grey and other nearby areas of the west side of Vancouver to help West 10th return to the active and thriving retail strip that it was before Safeway and many other retailers closed their doors in recent years.
“BGO understands how important this site is to the community,” he said, referring to presentations and open houses in the past two years.

Full text: Yves Michaud was a fiery Quebec nationalist whose eclectic career included being a journalist, a politician, a diplomat, a wine merchant and a shareholders’ rights activist.
In one guise or another, he was involved in events spanning half a century of contemporary Quebec history, often in contentious circumstances involving nationalism, sovereignty and the promotion of the French language.
Mr. Michaud died Tuesday evening at the age of 94, his son Luc said in a telephone interview.
“My father was a man of ideas. He was a polemicist. He was someone who, when he thought a cause was just, fought ferociously for it,” Luc Michaud said.
The elder Mr. Michaud was a close friend of one of Quebec’s most popular premiers, René Lévesque, and a sworn enemy of the Parti Québécois’ other great charismatic leader, Lucien Bouchard.
In 1977, Mr. Michaud had a cameo role the night Mr. Lévesque drove over a homeless man. In 1997, he won a landmark ruling for shareholders’ rights, having argued his own case in court.
When Mr. Bouchard became premier, Mr. Michaud joined PQ dissidents seeking tougher language laws.
His time in the spotlight ended bitterly. In 2000, he commented on the lack of support for independence among minority voters, especially Jews.
In a rare move, the Quebec National Assembly unanimously adopted a motion condemning his remarks.
Mr. Michaud spent years afterward saying he had been wrongly painted as an antisemite. The motion particularly stung because it had been supported by Mr. Bouchard and 65 other PQ members.
A number of politicians and pundits now feel that he was the victim of a political ambush by higher-ups in the PQ who wanted to shunt aside the outspoken maverick. “It’s the most venal, villainous thing ever orchestrated,” Mr. Michaud said in a 2014 television interview, “… one of the worst injustices I ever saw or heard in Quebec public life.”
Ironically, decades earlier, when he was a rookie politician, Mr. Michaud was praised by the Canadian Jewish Congress after he criticized a cabinet minister for mentioning Jews while heckling in the National Assembly.
Mr. Michaud was a combative man, someone who, by his own account, had grown a thick skin to handle all the jabs against his uncompromising views, his cultivated way of speaking French, his short stature.
His rhetoric leaned to the hyperbolic. “I feel like an exile in my own city, an outcast in my own land!” he said, complaining about English signs. He called francophones who were conciliatory on language issues “weak-willed, timorous and pusillanimous.” He dismissed François Legault, the current Quebec Premier, as “a stutterer of the French language.”
He was born in Saint-Hyacinthe, Que., on Feb. 13, 1930, the younger of the two sons of Robertha Robert and JeanBaptiste Michaud, an insurance salesman.
The town was conservative but he came from a lineage of long-time Liberals. “In my family, it was almost part of the genetic code, it was our heritage, we were red,” he recalled in a National Assembly oral history.
Freelance journalism led him to the editorship of a local weekly, Le Clairon, where he penned biting criticisms of the Union Nationale government of Maurice Duplessis, calling it a “tuberculous regime.” In the pages of the progovernment Courier de Saint-Hyacinthe, he was mocked as “le petit Michaud” (little Michaud).
While at Le Clairon, Mr. Michaud befriended one of his contributors, Mr. Lévesque, who would become a provincial cabinet minister in the reformminded Liberal government of Jean Lesage.
Mr. Lévesque then recruited Mr. Michaud to run as a Liberal candidate in 1966. However, the Union Nationale defeated the Liberals in that election so Mr. Michaud made his legislature debut from the opposition benches.
During a debate in the National Assembly in 1967, two Union Nationale ministers heckled the Liberal Claude Wagner, making an apparent reference to his German Jewish father. Gabriel Loubier shouted “How do you say that in Jewish?” while Jean-Noël Tremblay added “In German!”
Mr. Michaud complained to the speaker, asking if the ministers “fed themselves on xenophobia and racism.” The Canadian Jewish Congress praised him for having the “courage to raise the matter and ask the ministers for a retraction.”
Later that year, Mr. Lévesque quit the Liberals, on his way to forming the PQ.
Mr. Michaud, meanwhile, sat as an independent Liberal because he disagreed with his party’ support of Bill 63, which gave parents the choice to send kids to English school.
Mr. Michaud still ran as a Liberal in the 1970 election but lost. His move to the sovereigntist side was cemented three years later when he ran unsuccessfully for the PQ.
Next, he managed the pro-sovereignty newspaper Le Jour, which turned into a money-losing headache that had to shut down in the summer of 1976. A few months later, the PQ took power. Mr. Michaud hadn’t been a candidate but Mr. Lévesque made him an adviser on international affairs.
The evening of Feb. 5, 1977, Mr. Lévesque and his secretary and future wife, Corinne Côté, attended a dinner party hosted by Mr. Michaud. Driving home, the premier fatally struck a homeless man, Edgar Trottier.
The police didn’t give Mr. Lévesque a Breathalyzer test so Mr. Michaud had to tell investigators that the seven diners that night drank two bottles of a Bordeaux, Château Puyfromage. Police and a coroner concluded that it was an accident and that there were no grounds for criminal charges.
The PQ appointed Mr. Michaud as its delegate to Paris in 1979. When he returned to Quebec, he started a company exporting wine from France, selling vintages such as Château Puyfromage, and later Coteau de l’Élisette, the Languedoc red produced by another PQ premier, Jacques Parizeau, after he left politics.
In 1992, Mr. Michaud lost part of his savings when Montreal-based General Trustco made bad real-estate deals and could only repay 30 cents on the dollar to its debenture holders.
He began fighting for better corporate accountability. Representing himself in Superior Court, he won in 1997 a ruling that forced the Royal Bank and National Bank to put to a vote shareholders’ proposals on executive pay and governance rules.
He became a fixture at bank annual meetings, where he won few of the votes but claimed moral victories.
At the same time, he fought on another front after Mr. Bouchard had become Quebec premier and PQ leader.
Mr. Michaud was part of a dissident wing that felt Mr. Bouchard was too soft on the language issue.
“I’m humiliated and insulted daily in what’s left of the second-largest French-speaking city in the world, scarred and disfigured by all the Second Cup, Liquor Store Cabaret, Wal-mart, Club Price and Winners signs,” Mr. Michaud said to thundering applause at the 1996 PQ convention.
During a Dec. 5, 2000, radio interview, he recalled how he ran into Liberal senator Leo Kolber at a barbershop.
“Are you still a separatist, Yves?” Mr. Kolber asked.
“Yes I’m a separatist, just like you are Jewish,” Mr. Michaud said he responded. “It took your people 2,000 years to have their own country in Israel. … As far as I’m concerned, whether it takes 10 years, 50 years or 100 more years, it can wait.”
Mr. Kolber replied it wasn’t the same thing, according to Mr. Michaud. “It’s never the same for them. The Armenians didn’t suffer. The Palestinians aren’t suffering. The Rwandans aren’t suffering. I said, ‘It’s always you people.
You are the only people in the history of humankind to suffer.’ I was fed up.”
A week later, Mr. Michaud announced he would seek the nomination in the by-election for Mercier, a safe PQ riding. He said he wouldn’t hold back on expressing “dissenting views” if elected.
This prompted the Jewish organization B’nai Brith to urge Mr. Bouchard to veto the Michaud candidacy. The premier said he disagreed with Mr. Michaud but didn’t plan to intervene.
The following day, on Dec. 13, Mr. Michaud testified at a commission on the future of the French language in Quebec.
He mentioned the lack of support for independence in Côte Saint-Luc, a Montreal district with a large Jewish population. If immigrants and Côte Saint-Luc residents understood the French language and culture better, more would support sovereignty, Mr. Michaud said.
He also cited words by Lionel Groulx that urged Quebeckers to emulate the Jews in their spirit of solidarity and their will to retain their identity. The nationalist cleric, who died in 1967, was an influential Quebec thinker but also a controversial figure whose writings sometimes denigrated Jews and repeated stereotypes about them.
In his remarks, Mr. Michaud derided the idea that the Lionel-Groulx subway station should be renamed. He quipped that René Lévesque Boulevard might as well be renamed after the Israeli politician Ariel Sharon.
The next day, at the instigation of the Liberals, the National Assembly unanimously adopted a motion condemning him for making “unacceptable” remarks.
Mr. Michaud complained that MNAs had voted on the motion without checking what exactly he had said. He insisted that his comments actually praised Jews.
The issue was still raw a month later when Mr. Bouchard suddenly quit politics. Without explicitly mentioning Mr. Michaud, the premier said in his departing remarks that he was baffled how the debate on language turned into a discussion over whether Jews suffered more than others. “I affirm that Quebec citizens without distinction can exercise their right to vote for whoever they please without being accused of intolerance,” he said.
Three days later, Mr. Michaud withdrew from the nomination for Mercier.
In a public letter, he blamed B’nai Brith and Mr. Bouchard’s “excommunication.”
As time went by, his remarks about the legislature motion turned increasingly acerbic. In 2011, he called it an “imbecilic vulgarity” and a “shameful circus.” In 2014, he said Mr. Bouchard “behaved like a scoundrel.”
He died however without seeing the legislature revoke the motion.
“He brought so much to the French language. We have to remember this giant figure,” Marie-Anne Alepin, president of the nationalist Société SaintJean-Baptiste, said in an interview.
Mr. Michaud leaves his wife, Monique Morrissette, and their children, Luc and Anne, and grandchildren Virginie, Clara, Eloïse and Gabriel. He was predeceased by granddaughter Delphine.

Full text: DONE DEAL 1269 Esquimalt Ave., West Vancouver, B.C.
WEST VANCOUVER Asking price: $1.799-million (Feb. 22) Selling price: $2.552-million (March 1) Days on the market: Nine Taxes: $6,539.17 (2022) Listing agent: Michelle Vaughan, Royal Pacific Lions Gate Realty WHAT THEY GOT This West Vancouver house is in the desirable Ambleside neighbourhood, on a 50by 139-foot lot, with views of the ocean and Stanley Park.
Built in 1952, the 2,987square-foot, shingled house has three bedrooms, two bathrooms and a three-bedroom tenanted suite on the lower level. The original owner had done some work on the house over the years, but it needs updates.
The two-storey house is within walking distance of schools, transit, shops and a recreation centre, and is a short drive to downtown Vancouver.
THE ACTION Because the lender was threatening foreclosure on March 19 due to arrears, realtor Michelle Vaughan had to act fast to sell the property. She felt a responsibility to the senior whose parents had owned the house before him and now had to sell because of health issues.
“I said, ‘We will go in low, but I will get you lots of offers and you will do just fine,’ ” says Ms. Vaughan. “So, we got it on the market and over 300 groups looked at the house in four open houses. We got 37 offers. It was crazy. They went from being in the fire to being all good – especially because they didn’t owe much.”
The seller preferred that the buyer would live in the home, and they would keep the tenants, and the local buyer plans to do both, says Ms. Vaughan.
The sale completed March 19.
THE AGENT’S TAKE Ms. Vaughan said not one offer was below asking, which surprised her. Because of the successful sale, she heard from another realtor that a house down the street that had sat on the market for the last year just received some interest. The realtor plans to use her sale as a comparable.
“I hate to be the one who just raised the prices in Ambleside, but I did,” she says with a laugh.
“When you see that many offers, that tells you there are people with money that just want to buy. I think we are going to have a crazy spring market. We are going back to a seller’s market.”

Full text: The mayor of Vaughan, Ont., is seeking a sweeping bylaw that would restrict protests near places of worship, schools and other sites.
Steven Del Duca said Monday that he was reacting to local acts of violence and intimidation related to the Israel-Hamas war.
His proposed member’s resolution seeks fines of up to $100,000 for actions “intended to intimidate, incite hatred, violence or discrimination” within 100 metres of these places.
“A line has been crossed,” he said in an interview. “People seem to feel like they have incredible licence, regardless of one’s stance on a particular issue, to be very aggressive.”
Mr. Del Duca needs the support of Vaughan council for his member’s resolution to become a bylaw in the city immediately north of Toronto, beginning with a committee meeting next month and then again later. For procedural reasons, such a bylaw would not come into force for several months at the soonest.
The Canadian Civil Liberties Association (CCLA) panned the proposal for being overly broad.
“You’re pushing people out of the public square,” CCLA executive director and general counsel Noa Mendelsohn Aviv said.
“What they’re proposing to do is to create these very, very large zones around many, many, many different institutions throughout the city in which people cannot peacefully assemble and raise their voices on any number of political issues.”
But the proposal was welcomed by the Centre for Israel and Jewish Affairs, which said such rules would give protection to the community, Shimon Koffler Fogel, president of the advocacy organization, praised the proposed bylaw and said it was important to draw a line against aggressive behaviour. He said that people in his community have had antisemitic and violent slurs thrown at them during protests.
“These are intimidating, they are generating fear and anxiety within the community,” he said.
“I think any relief that the city is able to provide, so that they don’t feel that they under assault, is welcome and does represent a constructive way forward.”
Street protests have become a feature of Canadian cities since the Hamas attacks in Israel on Oct. 7, which killed 1,200 people, and Israel’s counterattack in Gaza that has killed tens of thousands.
On Monday, Toronto police Chief Myron Demkiw said his officers had monitored more than 500 protests about the war in that city alone. He said police had made 24 protest-related arrests and laid 30 charges.
He also said reports of hate crimes since Oct. 7 were nearly double that of the same period a year earlier. Most of the complaints were related to antisemitism, though the chief said he was concerned about underreporting of Islamophobic incidents.
Some of the protests over the past five months have prompted pushback from the Jewish community, which argues it is being targeted. This month, a Montreal synagogue and the Federation CJA, a Jewish community organization, obtained an injunction keeping protesters at least 50 metres from their buildings.
While the final wording of any bylaw in Vaughan would be subject to the wishes of councillors and the advice of the city’s legal counsel, Mr. Del Duca would go further than that injunction. The press release announcing his proposed member’s resolution cites the need to prohibit “demonstrations of a nature that are intended to intimidate, incite hatred, violence or discrimination within 100 metres of a religious institution, schools, childcare centre, hospital, congregate care settings or other vulnerable social infrastructure.”
A recent demonstration at a synagogue in Thornhill, Ont., which lies partly within Vaughan, was timed to co-ordinate with a real estate presentation there on land sales in Israel and in the occupied West Bank. Mr. Del Duca argued that a place of worship’s protection should not be negated by a non-religious event being held there.
“Does that mean that there’s nobody in the building who’s praying? Does that mean that there’s nobody in the building who’s worshipping? Does that mean there’s no rabbi or imam or priest who’s in there doing anything religious?” he said. “It’s still a place of worship.”

Full text: On the ever-popular topic of home renovations, Canadians are downsizing – at least, in terms of their budgets. The fifth annual HomeStars Reno Report revealed that homeowners spent an average of $12,300 in 2023 on renovations, and this number is expected to fall by more than $2,000 in 2024.
Vanessa Francis, a Milton, Ont.-based designer, says concerns about the economy and higher interest rates have shifted homeowners’ focus. “New client inquiries have slowed a bit,” she says. The clients who are planning to go ahead have “built equity and are ready to renovate with that in mind.”
The Globe asked five experts in homerelated fields, from real estate to design and sustainability, how Canadians could maximize a $10,000 spend on their homes this year.
THE REAL ESTATE EXPERT If your home is 15 years or older, it’s especially important to spend a minimum of $10,000 in upkeep a year, says Dawn Dauphinee, a licensed realtor and co-owner of Domus Realty in Halifax. She qualifies renovations as falling under either a “function” or “fashion” category.
“It’s way more fun to pay for pretty things than to pay for maintenance or efficiency items,” she says. “But ultimately, a house that isn’t maintained shows poorly even if it has some trendy bells and whistles.”
Roof and siding repairs, new eavestroughs, decks, fences and tree trimming are some of the items at the top of Dauphinee’s recommended upgrade list for a home’s exterior – especially as extreme weather events occur across the country. A new driveway is another practical upgrade with the added benefit of improving a home’s curb appeal.
Inside the home, Dauphinee suggests installing a sump pump, upgrading appliances or painting to get the most bang for your buck. A mini facelift to a bathroom or kitchen is always worthwhile, she says (read on for specific tips), as is installing new flooring in targeted areas.
THE INTERIORS EXPERT Layering walls with panel moulding, shiplap, or tongue-and-groove adds character, especially in newer houses and condos, according to designer Vanessa Francis of Vanessa Francis Design. “You can certainly install these decorative treatments yourself and the cost for the supplies is relatively low,” she says. To up the wow factor, Francis suggests hanging wallpaper above wainscoting or applied panels. Installing moulding yourself could save as much as $2,000, depending on the size of the room.
Be sure to watch some instructional videos online, and have a laser level and tools to cut the moulding at an angle on hand.
If a bathroom refresh is the dream, a few cosmetic changes will go a long way. As long as the vanity is in good condition and has storage, it’s worthwhile to consider changing the surface to something more luxe. “You could see if a local counter fabricator has an offcut,” Francis says – a classic decorator trick for acquiring a higherend piece of marble or stone for less.
“A mirror from a vintage store, and a new faucet and wall sconces will also make a dated bathroom feel new,” she says. If replacing the current floor tiles doesn’t fit the budget, consider using specialty paint to create a trendy checkerboard pattern, or apply peel-and-stick tiles over the existing ones.
Finally, Francis suggests spending on meaningful art and quality framing to create a gallery wall: “It doesn’t cost much but has such an impact in a living room or going up the stairs.”
THE SUSTAINABILITY EXPERT “I would spend every penny on airtightness,” says Bettina Hoar, chair of Sustainable Buildings Canada and founder of Sage Living, a Toronto-based sustainability consultancy. “‘Airtight’ doesn’t mean you can’t breathe; it simply means you are controlling the air so that it’s brought in purposefully, rather than finding its way in.”
An easy do-it-yourself way to check for airtightness is to move around your home with a candle, she says. If it flickers, you’ve probably got a draft. Having a certified energy assessment is another inexpensive way to pinpoint your home’s inefficiencies and help discern which improvements are worth your reno budget.
Recommended remedies include updating old or broken windows, replacing caulking around windows and doors, beefing up attic insulation and checking that dryer vents are well sealed.
Hoar says that depending on government regulations, the next several years could see homeowners having to report energy use – and pay a penalty if consumption is over the limit for a dwelling of its size. “Right now, in Toronto, that’s only the case for buildings above 50,000 square feet, but in order for Canada to meet its aggressive carbon goals, we’ll have to renovate every existing building eventually,” she says.
We still live in a heating-dominated climate, she points out, and electric sources of heating and cooling will become the norm. If you’ve got a central air system that’s nearing the end of its life, Hoar suggests converting it to a heat pump, which provides both hot and cold air despite the name.
THE KITCHEN EXPERT There’s value in hiring a professional, even for a budget-conscious reno, says Jack Creasy, principal and creative director of Toronto’s Jack Creasy Design.
In one recent project, Creasy – who’s known for his standout kitchens but also does full-home design – assessed that the cabinetry, counters and backsplash were in good condition and worth keeping. “People think designers are expensive but, in many cases, we can steer the project and ensure the spending aligns with the desired outcome,” he says.
After deciding what to maintain, Creasy was able to direct the homeowners to spend on a striking two-tone paint treatment for upper and lower cabinets, elegant satin brass hardware and a complementary satin brass faucet. “These minor alterations revitalized the space,” he says.
“Think of hardware, plumbing fixtures and lighting as the jewellery of the kitchen.
You can be wearing the same black dress but switch out the accessories and you’ve got a different look.”
He also suggests prioritizing key areas of the kitchen and investing where it counts.
By replacing the kitchen’s centrepiece – the island – with a new permanent custom island or even a freestanding island or table sourced at a vintage or antique store, you can create a new focal point, and the impression that you’ve refreshed the entire room.
THE LANDSCAPE EXPERT Out in the garden, invest in changes with both a visual and climate-friendly impact, says landscape designer Erin Renwick, owner of Victoria-based Greenspace Designs.
The smartest place to start is with the lawn: “Instead of wasting water or living with a brown lawn, try creating a droughttolerant native grass and wildflower meadow,” Renwick says. Planting by seed is a cost-effective way to achieve this look even for a large area. From an aesthetic perspective, your garden meadow will flower in stages throughout spring and summer and provide an appealing natural habitat for birds and pollinators.
Renwick’s other suggestions include: planting a small grove of native trees to help cool your home; installing rain barrels or cisterns to catch your rainwater for the irrigation of garden beds or potted plants; and building raised garden beds on a patch of lawn or even unused driveway or patio space.
“If you’ve got a spot that gets six to eight hours of sunlight per day, growing your own organic vegetables is fun and rewarding,” she says. “Your grocery bills go down during growing season, and it’s a wonderful educational tool for kids.”

Full text: THE LISTING A little over an hour west of Ottawa on the shores of Lake Calabogie, the owners of the local ski hill have launched the first phase of an ambitious plan to build more than 400 new homes.
After a couple of turbulent years in the recreational property market, the proposal by Calabogie Peaks to redevelop 700 acres on the mountain it owns into a master-planned community of six distinct neighbourhoods could face an uphill hike, but taking the time to get things right is a hallmark of the ownership group.
Calabogie Peaks president Paul Murphy’s family has been cottaging in the Calabogie area since the 1940s. In 1982, he was working on Wall Street in New York when his father, Harold Murphy, called to let him know he was buying the local ski hill.
“Whoa, what are you thinking?” Mr. Murphy said. At the time the Peaks was a pretty basic local hill, it had T-bar lifts and some amenities, but his father – a Toronto-area lawyer – had a vision of a four-season destination for the 1,500-acre site. Despite his initial misgivings, Mr. Murphy co-invested over the years as Calabogie enhanced its 45-acre waterfront, added buildings and amenities, chair lifts and resort infrastructure. He and two siblings eventually bought the site from his father in 2006, and Paul began to take more of a daily management role after he left Wall Street in 2009, shortly before his father’s death in 2011.
Adding residential real estate on the site was something he discussed with his father, but it wasn’t until 2015 that he started planning intensively. Almost 10 years later, he finally has all the pieces in place to start realizing the dreams the senior Murphy had for the mountain when he bought it four decades ago.
“It’s a little emotional,” Mr. Murphy said. “I wanted to see that vision through you might say.”
The first phase, called Juniper Ridge, will be a ski-in and ski-out access community built about 200 feet above the resort’s “village” at the base of the hill. Giannone Petricone Associates designed the modernist mix of townhouses and stacked townhouses that will feature 97 units (about a third are for sale now) with floor plan options that range from a one-bedroom, 650-squarefoot apartment style unit for $569,000 to a three-bed, 1,425square-foot townhouse for $899,000.
Experts say that with high costs of construction and high interest rates for borrowers, it’s a difficult time to sell new-build homes generally, much less in the recreational market.
“Some of it is mirroring where we are in the market in general, and still a little bit of sit and wait,” said Jasmine Cracknell-Young, a vice-president with real estate analysts Zonda Urban.
Recently, the pricing in the tiny township of Greater Madawaska – the area that includes Calabogie Lake with just about 2,500 residents – followed the boom-bust of pandemic-area cottage country across Ontario.
“We saw huge increases in 2022, in terms of sales and sale price, in 2023, we saw the average number round off to where it was in 2021 … and it’s been a little bit slower to start this year for sure,” said Jessica Fay, a broker with Royal LePage Team Realty and a lifelong Calabogie resident.
According to data from the local Renfrew County Real Estate Board, the median price in the area spiked to $700,000 in 2022, before falling back to below $500,000 in 2024.
“It’s been hard to find buyers over $500,000 for the last six months to a year,” said Vincent Johnston, a salesperson with Century 21 Eady Realty, who said even lakefront property has become a difficult sell. “There’s been no waterfront sales on Calabogie Lake; well, there’s one that sold for $1.2-million, but they started at $2-million a year ago. It took a big drop to get that done. I’ve got one on the waterfront; it’s $785,000 … I can’t get people to see it!”
Calabogie Peaks’ communities could be priced on the higher end of the local market, though the units are probably still two years away from delivery.
“You can’t forget how emotional a purchase of real estate can be,” Ms. Cracknell-Young said. “When it is the secondary home market, it’s a lot different than a traditional home purchase. Those buyers are always there: They want to spend their weekends cottaging, that doesn’t go away.”
Mr. Murphy has spent a lot of time and money getting Calabogie Peaks to this point, and despite the gyrations in the recreational market he’s betting on the appeal of his mountain. There’s no municipal services on the resort, so Mr. Murphy has had to lay the literal groundwork for his plans by building out its own on-site water, sewage and even telecommunications capacity to support the development. Functionally, the Peaks will have the best internet in the region with fiber-to-the-home delivered by the resort’s homegrown internet service.
“I haven’t been at this thing to squeeze every nickel out of it, my family has front-ended a huge investment. The pride and joy will be the result,” Mr. Murphy said.
Future phases of the development may include a mountaintop village, a lakeside community and additional units in the resort’s village, where it tested the concept when it subdivided a boutique hotel and sold the suites as condo units in 2020.
Nevertheless, Mr. Murphy has a take-it-slow approach and won’t begin marketing those phases until they get the market feedback and Juniper Ridge is under way. The process could take a while, and he acknowledges that much like his father he may not live to see the culmination of this family vision.
“This could be 20 years of development plus,” he said. “I think it’s going to continue to evolve past my lifespan.”

In Calgary, some condo owners cashing out as others climb in: Unprecedented population growth has led to a recovery in the resale market

Full text: Come springtime, Addie Laratta plans to list her Calgary condo. The monthly mortgage payments for her 1,400-square-foot unit in Skyview Ranch, in the city’s northeast, rose in 2023 from $900 to $1,600.
An “accidental” landlord, Ms. Laratta has been holding on to the property since 2018, as she first acquired the condo at the height of 2014 for about $325,000, shortly before Calgary’s economic downturn. “I paid high for it – I was very worried,” she says. “But with the situation now, it seems I won’t lose money. I’ll probably make my money back.”
In the face of unprecedented population growth, Calgary’s condo market has recovered and condo owners are finally cashing out. In January, the benchmark price in the condo segment reached $330,500, according to the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA) data, breaking the city’s prior record of $288,700 in 2014.
However, despite the sale of nearly 7,900 apartment condos in 2023, builders have not rushed to add new supply, contributing to the resale inventory’s drop to 1.21 months of supply in February.
When condo prices surged a decade ago, more than 5,600 starts followed the completion of 2,825 apartment condos. By contrast, last year the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) recorded roughly 4,100 condo starts and 1,844 completions in the same segment.
One reason for this difference is that elevated interest rates have undermined the financial capacity of buyers, explains Ray Wong, vice-president of data solutions delivery at Altus Group.
“The challenge in Calgary, and across Canada, is whether there’s demand to buy at this point, based on the interest rates. People are waiting for interest rates to come down a bit.”
But as rental rates in Calgary soar, some renters are opting to bite the bullet and buy their first home.
Last December, after five years renting a room in northwest Calgary, Taehoon Kim decided it was time to become a homeowner and start building equity, as interest rates remained stable.
“I believe buying now will save me money,” he says. “If you buy now, you will pay more interest, but interest rates can go down later. When interest rates go down, house prices will go up, and you can’t change anything.”
While initially he’d hoped to buy a townhouse, prequalifying for a mortgage below $400,000 limited Mr. Kim’s alternatives, because row homes in this price range are scarce.
After a month-long search, he moved on a $360,000, two-bedroom, two-bathroom condo in Sherwood, a suburban neighbourhood in Calgary’s north, that his agent, Brielle Mickey of Royal LePage Benchmark, found offmarket.
“I’d been looking at the housing market for about two years,” Mr. Kim says about his swift decision. “So I had an idea of how much I’d spend. I went to see three other condos, and that gave me context.”
Currently, Calgary’s median resale price in the apartment segment sits at $315,000, a 20-percent increase relative to last year.
But as supply continues to tighten, snatching a property below this price point is a growing challenge.
As the supply of apartment condos shrinks in Calgary’s resale market, first-time buyers and investors compete against each other, accelerating price growth.
“The inventory issue is because many people aren’t selling,” says Amanda Ku, a Calgary realtor and property manager, pointing at how a smaller inventory across segments is keeping owner-occupiers from listing their condo. Consequently, resale supply is largely contingent on sellers who, like Ms. Laratta, are looking to exit the rental market.
On Feb. 28, there were only 150 single-detached homes, 213 townhouses and 558 apartments available for sale in Calgary, Ms. Ku says. “Everything else is pending, or already sold.”
But while apartment construction in the condo market lags behind, purpose-built rentals are booming in Calgary.
Unlike 2014, when roughly 80 per cent of apartments constructed were in the condo market, purpose-built rentals now comprise about 65 per cent of completions in Calgary, and roughly 60 per cent of all apartments currently under construction.
According to Cole Haggins, president of Cedarglen Living, a Calgary builder, multifamily builders in Calgary have been shifting toward purpose-built rentals over the past two years because this type of investment offers higher returns.
“There’s been a lot of out-ofprovince investors coming to the Calgary marketplace,” he says.
“They’re not [general contractors] or builders themselves, they’re building on an investment basis and they’re hiring third-party [general contractors] to build these units for them so they can hold them long term, or sell them to a REIT.”
But Cedarglen isn’t shifting.
With 1,025 condos currently in the pipeline, 90 per cent of Cedarglen’s preconstruction units are already sold out, Mr. Higgins says, adding that he expects to build more than 2,500 condos over the next four years.
“The next few years will be our largest years by far in terms of the total volume that we’re going to do. … [But] the big question for our industry will be labour, and if we have the available trades to handle this increased capacity, as all my competitors are generally in the same position of growth.”
Although Cedarglen Living’s target market is downsizers, Mr. Haggins has noticed a significant spike in investor buyers for their smaller-sized product, a trend that’s without precedent in Alberta’s largest city.
“Now that interest rates have stabilized, and rents have gone up, there’s a wave of buyers looking at [condos] as an investment opportunity,” he says. “Nothing like this has ever been experienced before, in terms of buying units specifically for investment purposes – Calgary’s never been that marketplace.”
As a result, local realtors like Ms. Ku are struggling to find condos for her buyer clients. “I would love to get them in, but by the time I hear about a pre-construction sale, it’s already sold out.”

Full text: DONE DEAL 10766 Valley Springs Rd., N.W., Calgary VALLEY RIDGE Asking price: $725,000 (December, 2023) Selling price: $740,000 (January, 2024) Previous selling prices: $560,000 (June, 2018); $525,000 (February, 2008); $245,500 (November, 1999) Taxes: $4,100 (2023) Days on the market: 11 Listing agents: Ben Archibald and Byron Howard, eXp Realty THE ACTION This three-bedroom house was the smallest of the properties up for sale in the Valley Ridge area around the new year, and it was also the one with the lowest asking price. That distinction drew offers from three bidders, with one adding $15,000 to the asking price to seal the deal.
“It’s usually a slow time, especially between Christmas and the New Year, but there was very little inventory, and we were able to capitalize on people looking before the new year hit,” said agent Ben Archibald.
“We definitely didn’t price for multiple offers, so it was a surprise to see. But we did expect the market to explode in January, so we caught the front end of that.”
WHAT THEY GOT At the end of a culde-sac, this 27-year-old house has an attached double garage and 2,093 square feet of living space across two floors, plus 700 square feet in the basement.
There is a den off the main dining area, and entertaining spaces on all three levels, including two with gas fireplaces.
The eat-in kitchen is outfitted with stainless steel appliances, a pantry and island. There is direct access to a two-tiered deck and garden on the 65- by 125-foot corner lot. Recent improvements include a new roof and renovations in two out of the home’s four bathrooms.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “It’s an excellent house, very well kept with a nice layout and living space upstairs,” said Mr. Archibald.
“You had an oasis-type backyard, very private and secluded.”
Local amenities were another highlight. “You have green space next door, and just down the hill, probably a five-minute walk, is Bowness Park with a dog park and a lot of walking trails,” Mr. Archibald said.

Black farmers are taking on Canada’s agricultural challenges: With many existing operators getting ready to retire, young, racialized farmers could be key to feeding Canadians into the future

Full text: C heyenne Sundance is part of a growing class of Black farmers who are hoping to help teach Canadians about agriculture and change what people assume a farmer looks like.
She’s doing her part through her farm called Sundance Harvest, which she launched in 2019.
The business is actually more reminiscent of a hip tech startup in its early years if anything. The farm relies on a small team of eager young people for operations. It has unusual work hours, uses social media and, just like techpreneurs, it’s beholden to a fickle marketplace. For instance, the uncharacteristic warming and freezing this winter makes her work trickier than a regular office job, but worth it, Ms. Sundance says.
She grows vegetables on land located at Woodbine Racetrack in Toronto, as well as in Bolton, Ont., and Guelph. She also provides space for community members to grow and harvest their own produce, a profound move during a cost-of-living crisis in which the price of food has skyrocketed.
The 27-year-old, who boasts of 34,000 followers on Instagram, knows the struggles that go along with being a farmer better than her age suggests.
She launched Sundance Harvest with little money and no connections. And, despite the challenges, she is finally making a profit.
“Being young, being a woman, I’ve gotten my fair share of, you know, harassment and discrimination, but I feel like I really wanted this to happen and now, look at us, you know, we’re growing.”
Ms. Sundance’s success and personal ethos on diversity inspired her to launch a non-profit program on-site that teaches farming basics – from how to fix a tractor to caring for bees – as well as providing mentorship to marginalized groups. It’s a program that she wishes had existed when she was starting out, and one that could be part of the solution to a looming disaster that Canada faces: too few farmers.
She’s not wrong. Currently, Black people make up only 4.9 per cent of racialized farm operators in the country, according to 2021 data from Statistics Canada, the latest available. Black farmers fall significantly behind other ethnic groups.
Meanwhile, the same report found that racialized farm operators who hold a bachelor’s degree – or higher – make up more than double the number of non-racialized farmers.
Additionally, Black farmers tend to operate smaller farms, which are more vulnerable to climate change, supply chain issues and price hikes for essential goods.
“The struggle I know for many new Black farmers is access and capital,” Ms. Sundance says. “Because really, who has access to intergenerational wealth and lots of land? Usually not most Black people.”
A 2023 report called Africulture – an initiative by Pitch Better, an incubator that supports underrepresented entrepreneurs in Canada, alongside FoodPreneur Lab, Dalhousie University and others – found systemic barriers are preventing more Black Canadians from entering the industry.
“If we have more farmers in Canada who contribute to producing more, we will help minimize the risk of food insecurity in terms of availability of local food,” says Emmanuel Yiridoe, a professor at Dalhousie University. “Ukraine and COVID have shown people how easy it can be to disrupt food supplies.” As well, people who know how to farm in droughts or heat waves have skills that may become necessary with climate change.
The other reason to look to Black farmers? Canadian immigration policies mean the talent is likely already here.
“A lot of us immigrants, including myself – I came originally from Ghana – we immigrated from countries that are agricultural. So, some of those immigrants who are now in Canada would have grown up in their original home countries and are familiar with farming or involved in agriculture,” Dr. Yiridoe says. “Think of the possibilities. Think of the economics.”
Ms. Sundance’s Toronto property is approximately half an acre and was acquired in February.
Her journey isn’t typical and shouldn’t be the assumed path for everyone, of course.
“We are not the future because we’re actually not production farmers,” she says. She plans to one day acquire land in the country in order to do more. It’s a long way off from where she is right
now, though. “We’re just market gardeners, and we’re doing it in such a small way.”
For Max Hansgen, president of the National Farmers Union – Ontario, support for new, young and racialized farmers is the key to feeding Canadians into the future.
“The average age of farmers in Canada is deeply concerning for the future of farming. Transitioning farms within a family is no guarantee, as many farmers’ children grow up seeing the challenges involved and opt for a different lifestyle,” he says.
“Transitioning to new and younger farmers outside the family unit is even more difficult, as the upfront costs of purchasing land, infrastructure and machinery can take decades to recover from farm profits. The future of farming in Canada is dependent on new farmers being able to enter the industry.”
It’s something that Keith Currie has on his mind these days, too.
The president of the Canadian Federation of Agriculture is 62 and intimately aware of the problems the industry faces when it comes to working people. “I’m sort of on the tail end of the boomer generation. So, there’s a lot of people in my situation, and obviously at some point in time, we’re going to retire.”
For agriculture experts within Canada and outside the country, the shortage of skilled labour has become a serious threat to the billion-dollar industry here, something that could drag down the overall economy.
Angelina Williams is one of the handful of Black farm owners in Canada. She has a 37-acre farm near Port Dover, a town on Lake Erie, where she grows fruit such as papayas and bananas throughout the year. This impressive feat has garnered interest from a national food chain that is eager to buy produce from closer to home.
Despite this potentially life-changing deal, as well as a recently purchased 174-acre property in Stayner, Ont., Ms. Williams doesn’t plan to stop expanding her business any time soon – because it hasn’t been an easy ride to date.
“Farming is not an easily scalable industry in terms of, like, getting access into the industry,” she says. “We already know that it’s very, very challenging to acquire land in Canada and to acquire land that doesn’t flip a profit as quickly as, say, for example, residential real estate does.”
On top of that, there’s the implicit understanding that profits can be elusive for the first few years, and even a successful business can have a bad year – or two – that resets everything. It’s enough to push even the smartest entrepreneur to safer economic harbours.
“This job is 24/7 and it doesn’t stop at 5 p.m. It’s a lot of administrative work too.”
While more clients are a boon to her bottom line, Ms. Williams sees her business as something bigger than just a profit maker at the end of the day. “It’s got to be about more,” she says. She intentionally produces culturally specific foods and participates in markets for marginalized groups.
The Africulture study found that Black households face higher food insecurities and are more likely to experience food deserts – that is, areas with limited access to affordable and nutritious food. A 2020 report by the University of Toronto called PROOF had the same results, finding that Black households are some of the most food-insecure in the country.
“If we are making food accessible, it has to be the type of food that is culturally relevant for the group that you’re providing the food for. The pandemic slowed our access to a lot of the fruits and vegetables that we’re used to as Canadians,” Ms. Williams said.
While she’s optimistic that change is possible, she sees more institutional supports in place as a natural way to bring more Black people into a trade that is in desperate need of new farmers.
For Dr. Yiridoe, studies such as Africulture are pieces that can help draw attention to the issue – but they alone are not the solution.
“Do I expect things to change overnight? Of course not,” he says. “I am a realist. I have to be realistic. I would see this as a little drop of water.
Getting stakeholders to begin to understand that there is a gap. That we need to invest some dollars to support Black farmers, to support research related to the challenges and issues that Black farmers face with this research project is important.”

Full text: An Ontario real estate developer has unleashed a deluge of litigation against dozens of buyers of preconstruction homes who allegedly defaulted on purchases in a Windsor-area subdivision.
Starting in November, 2022, Coco Developments Ltd. filed more than two dozen claims related to houses it built at the River Ridge Estates project in Lakeview, Ont., just east of Windsor.
The claims describe preconstruction sales in the late summer and fall of 2021 followed by failures to close and complete transactions in the fall and winter of 2022.
According to the court documents, most of the buyers are not local to Windsor, with addresses mainly in the Toronto region.
According to Mark Morris, a real estate lawyer with Legalclosing.ca, the lawsuits are a sign of a burgeoning issue in the newbuild home market where more buyers are unable to find anyone to take over their contracts (known as an assignment sale), some buyers can’t afford to complete the transactions and more developers are turning to litigation to recoup losses.
“This was at first an individual issue, but it’s becoming more systemic,” Mr. Morris said.
“Builders that are facing five or six failed closings are turning to their only recourse, to see if, in fact, there’s any money in ‘them thar hills.’ ” The damages sought in each claim begin with the $40,000 deposit buyers placed for detached homes that ranged in price from $850,000 to $970,000.
But the final damages could end up being much higher.
“You don’t just lose your deposit if you walk away from any real estate deal – you can lose everything,” said David Feld, a real estate lawyer with Feld Kalia Professional Corp.
The damages Coco could seek to recover from the 26 claims The Globe and Mail reviewed could add up to millions, mainly because the buyers could be required to pay the difference between what their initial sale price was before they walked away from a deal and what the ultimate selling price will be if Coco can resell the home.
None of the claims and counterclaims have been proven in court.
One example illustrates the issue: On Feb. 21, 2023, Coco issued a claim against Balkar Singh Dhanju for his $40,000 deposit and “damages for breach of contract in an amount to be specified prior to trial.” According to the claim, Mr. Dhanju signed a contract in September, 2021, to buy a five-bedroom house (1,262 square feet of finished area) at 395 Cypress Lane for $853,757. The house was to be finished by September, 2022, but Coco’s claim says Mr. Dhanju informed them on Nov. 28, 2022, that he wouldn’t be able to close the deal.
The property at 395 Cypress Lane is currently for sale with an asking price of $759,000 – a price substantially below what Mr. Dhanju agreed to pay and well above the local going rate for detached homes in the Windsor area. The listing has been active for more than four months. Even if it were to get a full-price offer tomorrow, the damages Coco could seek from Mr. Dhanju would include not only the almost $100,000 gap between sale prices, but also any interest in carrying costs related to a house that has sat vacant for more than a year.
Mr. Dhanju could not be reached, and his lawyer declined to respond to request for comment.
According to property records, many of the homes in the claims have been listed for sale but few have been successfully resold.
Two successful sales appeared to have left Coco ahead: 389 Magnolia Lane was originally sold in 2021 for $870,153 and then resold in 2023 for $877,611; 1061 Aspen Ridge sold for $871,848 in 2021, and was resold in 2024 for $873,000. There are currently six other River Ridge Estates houses for sale, all listed below the original preconstruction contracted price.
Even at their reduced asking prices, the homes are priced significantly above the Windsor market, according to Joyce Blackmere, director of sales with Dan Gemus Real Estate Team Ltd.
The average home in Windsor sold for $550,000 in 2023, with sales activity falling from its peaks in 2021, when there were 7,700 transactions, to 4,900 sales.
Ms. Blackmere notes that the resale market and the new-build market diverge in several ways, and the average price of a newbuild home was about $800,000 in late 2022, when the majority of the Coco defaults happened. In her company’s research of newbuild sales, things slowed significantly once interest rates began to rise in the latter half of 2022.
“In the first half 2022, there were 190 new and precon sales, in the next 18 months it was about 152,” she said.
For several of the homebuyers who filed statements of defence or counterclaim, the inability to qualify for a mortgage appears to be the primary reason the deals fell through. Some cite rising interest rates, others claim a changing market undermined the assessed value of the home and some describe personal financial issues.
One defendant, Shazia Sabir, claims her closing was delayed because she was injured in a car accident. She also alleges her money for closing was stolen by another individual who she claims used it to buy a different Coco home. Ms. Sabir was contracted to buy 391 Hemlock Lane for $851,130. It is currently for sale with an asking price of $762,000.
The listing has been active for more than four months. Neither Ms. Sabir nor her lawyer responded to requests for comment.
Another set of defendants – Jasbir Singh Kapoor and Lavinder Kaur Kapoor, a couple in their 70s – allege they were rushed into a deal to pay $865,565 for 394 Mulberry Lane and that health issues have plagued them since they were unable to complete the purchase in 2022. “Lavinder Kaur Kapoor could not go to work either for the entire last year trying to take care of their health,” a statement of defence filed in September, 2023, states. “With no work, no income left, defendants ended up using all their savings to pay for groceries and rent and now living on borrowing from credit.” The Kapoors did not respond to a request for comment.
Jenny Coco, who owns Coco Developments, also has millions at risk in the insolvency of builder Sam Mizrahi’s The One, a 91storey condominium tower at Yonge and Bloor streets in Toronto. She is also a defendant in litigation surrounding the collapse of Bridging Finance Inc. Ms. Coco’s lawyer in the Windsor cases, Nina Perfetto of Fogler, Rubinoff LLP, didn’t respond to requests for comment.
Mr. Morris said he has seen developers willing to work with sellers to avoid litigation – using mechanisms such as vendortake-back mortgages or assisting the buyer in finding an assignment – but only if they have the balance sheet to manage delaying final payment.
“It’s much easier to be benevolent in this industry when you are Scrooge McDucking it into a vault filled with money, than when you’re down to pennies,” he said.

China scraps annual news conference: Premier Li Qiang will present a government work report Tuesday analyzing the past year and upcoming agenda

Full text: China has cancelled the premier’s news conference that traditionally helps kick off the annual National People’s Congress, the rubber-stamp parliament meeting in Beijing this week, amid major headwinds threatening the world’s second-largest economy and uncertainty about the country’s direction.
Since 1993, the country’s premier has held a news conference at the outset of the NPC, taking questions from both state and foreign media. Such events were always carefully stage-managed, with questions vetted in advance, but they were also the only access even Chinese media had to a top official.
On Tuesday, Premier Li Qiang, China’s No. 2 official, will present a government work report at the NPC, in which he will analyze the past year and lay out an agenda for the year to come, including a key GDP growth target. But NPC spokesman Lou Qinjian said Monday that the premier’s traditional news conference has been cancelled for the foreseeable future. Instead, lower-ranking ministers – even less likely than Mr. Li to go off script – will speak to the media on specific topics this week.
No reason was given. Mr. Li is a close ally of Chinese President Xi Jinping, who hand-picked him for the No. 2 role. But in the past decade, the role of premier – the nominal head of government, with responsibility for the economy – has been significantly downgraded, with economic decisionmaking centralized under Mr. Xi.
Those decisions have been raising significant questions of late, as China faces numerous economic challenges.
China’s economy has slowed drastically from the runaway growth it enjoyed during the 2000s and 2010s. It has struggled to bounce back from the pandemic, when the country was largely closed off to the rest of the world.
Property sales are way down, and consumer and producer prices are in deflationary territory.
On the bright side, sustained government intervention appears to have finally stabilized the stock market, after Chinese and Hong Kong equities lost $8-trillion in value over the past three years.
Like foreign observers, many Communist Party cadres are watching the NPC closely, having spent months reading the tea leaves of pronouncements as a collapsing housing market and massive local government debt drag on provincial budgets. Direction on priorities should have come at a high-level economic summit known as the Third Plenum, which is usually held a few months after the start of a new leadership term but has been repeatedly delayed for unclear reasons.
“Everybody is still waiting,” said Nis Grünberg, the lead political analyst at the Berlin-based Mercator Institute for China Studies (MERICS). “People are thirsting for some economic direction or planning.”
For decades, the party used strong economic growth to justify its tight control over Chinese politics. There is now widespread public anger over the state of the economy – youth unemployment is particularly high – in a country with a poor safety net for those whose savings have been wiped out by property or stock market slumps.
On Tuesday, Mr. Li is expected to announce a growth target of “around 5 per cent” and a deficitto-GDP ratio of 3 per cent, with some mild stimulus measures and words of encouragement for foreign investors, who have pulled large amounts of capital out of the country in recent months.
A stimulus could help take some of the weight off ordinary households and help boost domestic spending, something Beijing has long tried to do, but analysts do not expect any major intervention, pointing to Mr. Xi’s repeated warnings against such action and his distaste for socalled “welfarism,” which he says “encourages laziness.”
“The clear indicators, when you look at where capital has been actually flowing for the last several years, have been very consistent,” said Jacob Gunter, an economic analyst at MERICS. “It’s flowing away from households, from investment in real estate and such, and flowing towards the supply side of the economy, into fixed-asset investment, industrial upgrading and industrial expansion.”
Beijing, he said, is focused on “forcing down this bitter medicine” to address perceived longterm risks to the stability of the party state, even at the cost of short-term economic pain.
“From Xi Jinping’s perspective, he has a finite amount of resources available to him in terms of capital that you can allocate to different actors to achieve different goals,” Mr. Gunter said. “The problem with putting money toward households and consumers is they might buy the wrong things or might just save their money. They might invest more in real estate, and those are not the more geopolitically oriented and long-term strategically oriented goals that Beijing has in mind.”
Previewing his work report in January, Mr. Li said China has “withstood external pressure and overcome difficulties at home to achieve progress in boosting high-quality development.”
The latter slogan has been used dozens of times by top officials in the past year, but its meaning is not exactly clear. State media have referred to “scientific and technological innovation” as being key to high-quality development, which lines up with efforts to boost sectors such as domestic chip production, but Mr. Xi has also described the term as the “hard truth of the new era,” suggesting it encompasses more fundamental – and potentially difficult – reforms.
As well as economic measures, the agenda for this year’s NPC includes items such as the defence budget – expected to increase once again amid tensions with the United States and in the South China Sea – and some social issues. This may include raising the retirement age and more incentives to have children.
One thing that is not on the agenda is personnel appointments. Observers had predicted the meeting might be used to announce a replacement for former foreign affairs minister Qin Gang, who was removed from that role last July.

Toronto considers joining urban trend of converting parking to housing

Full text: For decades, parking policy in most North American cities has been designed to satisfy drivers, who wanted lots of it and wanted it cheap. But in the face of a housing affordability crisis, an increasing number of cities are deciding that some of their parking lots are better sites to build new homes than provide spots for cars.
Toronto is set to join this trend in a major way. City staff were given provisional approval last Thursday to study the conversion potential of 74 public parking lots – about one-quarter of the city’s total. If given the green light by full council later this month, staff plan to report back by the end of the year with a list of the most suitable sites, and timelines for conversion.
Similar moves are under way or eyed at sites across Canada. A 38-unit condo is planned on a golf club parking lot in Windsor, Ont. Formerly homeless people are living in small buildings on the parking lot of a shelter in Vancouver.
Rental housing, including affordable units, is planned for a church parking lot in St. Catharines, Ont.
“It’s a philosophical change, definitely, and a political change,” said Mark Richardson, with the Toronto-based advocacy group HousingNowTO. “A surface parking lot is an incredibly wasteful use of high-value land.”
But in some places, the trend has faced push-back from local residents and merchants who argue that less parking hurts neighbourhoods. A committee of Hamilton city council voted recently not to convert several dozen parking spaces into affordable housing. And Toronto’s changed philosophy about parking goes only so far.
At last week’s meeting of Mayor Olivia Chow’s executive committee, Toronto deferred until later in the year a council vote on whether to implement a city-wide levy on all commercial parking spots.
The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated a worldwide reckoning over how much space in urban areas has been given over to parking.
Tony Jordan, president of the non-profit Parking Reform Network, says there’s “a growing popular awareness” of how cities have been hurt by traditional parking policies.
“We’ve made a mistake,” he said, speaking, appropriately, from a parking garage in Austin, Tex., during a housing conference.
“We’re not all agreeing on how to get out of it, or how bad it is, I guess. But I think more and more, it’s pretty hard to justify what we’ve been doing once you really look at it critically.”
Parking imposes fiscal and environmental burdens on cities, many of which have declared climate emergencies. And Toronto’s willingness to consider its approach to parking comes after years of soaring housing costs.
“The shift away from parking accommodation to housing and community service accommodation at these parking lots could provide a significant pipeline of city-owned lands to meet the city’s housing and other goals,” David Jollimore, Toronto’s deputy city manager for corporate services, wrote in a staff report.
City media relations staff were not able to provide details on which lots were among those being examined for conversion or how many parking spaces they include. The amount of revenue these lots currently generate has not been part of the analysis to date, they said.
In a separate Toronto city staff report calling for a commercial parking levy, chief financial officer Stephen Conforti argued that it could raise money while “reducing congestion and positively contributing to climate action by encouraging Torontonians to use transit or other means to travel.”
As proposed, the levy includes all employee and customer parking, paid or unpaid, with the exception of sites such as hospitals, schools and religious institutions. Downtown parking spots would be levied approximately 50 cents a day, while ones elsewhere in the city would be charged half that amount.
Staff, who say in the report that the levy would raise as much as $150-million annually, will lay the groundwork for a council vote on it by doing public consultation through the year.
However, previous attempts to implement a parking levy were opposed vigorously by mall owners and the hospitality industry. Local merchants often argue that off-street parking is crucial to their success.
“Retail is still recovering from the pandemic in this city, and office vacancy is at a 30-year high,” Michael Brooks, chief executive officer of the commercial real estate industry association REALPAC, said at Ms. Chow’s executive committee meeting.
“Many of the downtown businesses are suffering, many have closed, and yet under this system higher prices [are] proposed downtown. I don’t get this, it’s not the time to do this.”
Asked during a recent media availability whether she supports such a parking levy, Ms. Chow did not answer directly. She said she wanted to consult first with the public. On Thursday, she told reporters that she recognized the concerns of downtown businesses, saying the city was “proceeding with caution.”
How-Sen Chong, the climate campaigner with the activist group Toronto Environmental Alliance, said it was overdue for the city to move ahead with the policy. He noted that it’s common in cities around the world.
“The experience of those cities basically shows that this entire ‘war on car’ rhetoric is kind of ridiculous. Because if it works for them, it should definitely work for here. It’s more than time that we actually implement one,” he said.

Full text: 61 King St.
PO RT HOPE, ONT.
Asking price: $2,999,000 Taxes: $11,561 (2023) Land size: 184 by 226 feet (irregular) Agent: Fionna Barrington, Chestnut Park Real Estate Ltd.
THE BACKSTORY In the 1850s, Port Hope, Ont. was undergoing a building boom on the shores of Lake Ontario.
Local magnate Robert Smith contributed to the expansion by developing a commercial block on Walton Street, which remains the historic town’s main thoroughfare today.
While building up his real estate holdings, Mr. Smith also established himself as a lumber dealer, according to Heritage Port Hope.
In 1858 he built a stately redbrick house for himself and his wife, Sara, on a hill overlooking the town and the Ganaraska River.
The Smith family sold 61 King St. to machinist John Helm in 1884. The young Mr. Helm was the son of a prominent Port Hope industrialist and the home remained in the family until 1968.
A new family took over for many decades until the property eventually fell into disrepair when the elderly owner could no longer look after it.
It had been sitting vacant for about 10 years in 2012 when a Toronto couple came across the rambling property with a Victorian-era coach house and a large plot of land.
They decided to sell their house in a hip Queen Street West neighbourhood and make the move to Port Hope, where they could raise their young daughter with a more traditional smalltown upbringing.
The couple was ready to tackle a renovation, but they grasped the true extent of the challenge only after they signed the deal: That’s when they learned heritage conservation rules protected the interior as well as the exterior of the house.
The couple learned the house, built in the Regency Villa style, had been expanded in the late 1800s. The protected elements included the oak staircase, panelled doors and marble fireplace mantles, but the couple had free rein to remove mid-century modifications such as false ceilings, a kitchen and a pink bathroom.
They hired local artisans to repair the intricate plaster ceiling mouldings and medallions and sand the wide plank pine floors.
A large principal room on the south side of the house was turned into a new kitchen and family room.
Outside, they spruced up the wraparound porch and brought the garden fountain back to working order.
The project won the 2013 Heritage Port Hope award in the residential category.
Around the same time, James Robinson and Donna Wilson were living in the Beaches in Toronto and contemplating a similar move to a smaller town with heritage architecture.
Many of the homes they looked at in Port Hope had a heritage designation, Ms. Wilson recalls.
To learn more about the stewardship of a century home, Mr. Robinson talked with an expert at Heritage Port Hope, who in turn recommended that he meet with the couple who had restored 61 King St.
Soon Mr. Robinson and Ms. Wilson were submitting an offer for a house a few doors down.
That deal did not come together but Mr. Robinson joked with his new friends at No. 61 that perhaps he should buy their house. To his surprise, he found them open to the idea of a sale.
After a quick negotiation between the two couples, Mr. Robinson and Ms. Wilson became the new owners.
“It was the easiest house we ever bought,” Mr. Robinson says.
THE HOUSE TODAY Mr. Robinson and Ms. Wilson appreciated the character and silent surroundings of the house with five bedrooms, three bathrooms and a powder room.
While the renovation had been extensive, they knew they would carry on with the refurbishment.
Mr. Robinson had worked on old houses in the past and he decided to take on the task of fixing up the authentic period windows. The original storm windows – built to match the sixover-six double-hung sash windows – were still in the home, but in some cases, the pulleys, putty and glazing were worn or broken.
Mr. Robinson dismantled many of the storm windows and rebuilt them with new materials.
Where the antique glass was not broken, the waves and bubbles add texture.
“They’re absolutely beautiful,” he says, pointing out that the storm windows are very energy efficient.
Originally the cast-iron hardware on the home’s windows and doors had a brass finish, but those details had been covered in many coats of paint over the years.
Mr. Robinson set out to refurbish the hinges, locks and other pieces by placing them in a Crock-Pot with some laundry detergent.
“You cook them for about eight hours,” Mr. Robinson says.
“The paint is practically falling off.”
The process of taking down and putting back doors is made more difficult by the way screws and grooves have shifted and settled in the old house. But the clean appearance is worth the toil, he says.
“It’s a labour of love,” he says.
“I can’t believe anybody ever painted them.”
The home’s residents have done a good job over the decades of preserving the elements they weren’t using, Ms. Wilson says.
The wooden shutters, for example, were numbered and stacked in the basement.
“This house, when it was built, was built by a wealthy man,” Ms. Wilson says. “Everybody took everything down knowing that somebody would probably put it back.”
On occasion, the couple needed to visit to a nearby warehouse full of building materials that had been salvaged from old homes in the surrounding Northumberland County.
They found an antique door, lock set and a brass doorbell to replace a back door in the house that was not of the period, for example.
Outside, Mr. Robinson tackled the overgrown shrubs which obscured the wraparound porch.
Maple, birch and other mature trees surround the house.
Ms. Wilson put in some raised beds for growing tomatoes and added poppies and peonies to the perennial gardens.
The couple enjoys visits to the nearby beach on Lake Ontario and the charm of Port Hope’s historic centre.
“We can walk to dinner,” Ms. Wilson says. “There’s a huge social community here.”
THE BEST FEATURE The largest undertaking was the renovation of the property’s coach house, part of which had been used as a garden shed for many years.
The coach house now serves as a workshop and showroom for Ms. Wilson, who retired from her career in the banking industry and took up a new vocation creating handbags from imported leather.
A staircase of metal and wood leads to the former hay loft, where skylights in the vaulted ceiling bring light to the interior.
The building has heating and air conditioning and a powder room.
Ms. Wilson points out that the coach house could easily be transformed into extra living space for the main house, or a guest cottage, among other uses.

Daycare combines natural light and a warm materials palette: CGS Architects put children first when designing the facility, with large play spaces, spacious bathrooms, oodles of sunshine, and a porch swing out front

Full text: ST. THOMAS, ONT.
‘There’s a theory in design that everything should be scaled to the user,” says architect Bill Curran of CGS Architects in Hamilton.
The users, in this case, can be heard down the hall; naptime is over and little shrieks of joy begin to bounce off the walls.
“So, for children, there should be low rooms so they feel more comfortable,” he continues, “but we thought this might be a little more inspiring – the high, lofty spaces that they might never have access to.”
He’s right. Not everyone can live in an architect-designed space. A space teeming with raw timber posts and thick beams has walls made of an intriguing system of wood panels (the construction of which Mr. Curran compares to the de Havilland Mosquito combat aircraft), bristles with big play spaces, spacious bathrooms, and oodles of natural light … and even sports a porch swing out front. But it’s all here in St. Thomas, Ont., at Stationview YMCA Child Care, built and paid for by the city.
“Before we moved in, I thought: ‘How are we going to fill this space, how are we going to use this?’” YMCA regional manager Lisa Wilson says. “But once you get in, and you live with it [and] see the children move through it and work their day through it, it’s been really great.”
And while the breezy and playful architecture is mostly what makes this building great – and more on that in a moment – Mr. Curran says it wouldn’t exist without the selfless vision of now-retired St. Thomas city manager Wendell Graves: “He comes off as that disarming, country gentleman, really nice and quiet,” Mr. Curran says. “Over time, I realized this guy’s a lot smarter. Not just smarter: there’s more depth and sophistication.
And there’s a civic-mindedness to him. There was no ego, grandiosity. Because I’m sick of working for people like that.”
Look around St. Thomas, and it’s clear Mr. Graves has shaken things up. In June, 2021, this space reported on Mr. Graves’s and Mr. Curran’s transformation of a “dust bowl” parking lot into 28 affordable housing units and home for the Railway City’s social services department, and the Transit Building into 16 “microapartments” for residents transitioning from living on the street.
And, again, what had been a parking lot at the corner of St. Catharine and Curtis streets – (“They gave up some of their parking, but, you know, parking is plentiful here,” Mr. Curran quips) – is now the child-care centre, big enough for 88 little ones ages six and under. Across the street is a new parkette, and a stone’s throw away is the Brutalist library by Brook, Carruthers and Shaw, which opened in 1974.
As Mr. Curran points out, this has led to a domino effect, as even privately owned buildings in the area have been spruced up; one even built what has become a popular restaurant patio.
“This wasteland, just off of downtown, all of a sudden it’s a vital, safe, civic precinct,” the affable architect says. It’s a master class in city building, and it wouldn’t hurt other municipalities to come and take a look.
Of course, a tour of the new child-care centre by CGS – formerly known as Their + Curran Architects – is also a lesson on how to take a TV-dinner budget yet provide a gourmet meal of a building. (Which reminds this writer of celebrity chef Susur Lee and his son, Jet Bent-Lee, and their TikTok TV dinner project).
Open the door, and one is struck not only by the natural light pouring in via big windows and clerestories, but also by the warm materials palette. The aforementioned cross-laminated timber posts, beams and wood wall system of course (provided by local factory Element5), but even inexpensive VCT flooring in tans, golds, creams and warm greys all mixed up to provide visual interest. Or, overhead, Mr. Curran’s choice of inexpensive yet luxurious-looking, artichokeshaped light fixtures and, on the walls, sconces made from onionskin-thick slices of wood.
Noting the generous staff room and how windows provide employees with multiple views in order to keep eyes on their charges, the children’s playrooms are what will impress visitors the most. High ceilings, views to City Hall via child-height windows with built-in benches, and sunlight that washes the wooden walls and ceiling to paint the entire room in golden hues.
Acoustic panels along the upper portion of one wall ensure the din doesn’t get overwhelming.
“Not your average child care area,” Mr. Curran says with a smile. “That’s one of the benefits of CLT panels: you get a wood interior. Three quarters of the walls are wood … as opposed to painted drywall and ACT [acoustic ceiling tile] ceilings.” Not to mention how quickly drywall can get dirty and dinged up, I say.
“And, also, [drywall is] lifeless,” Mr. Curran finishes.
On the exterior, simple yet inexpensive changes in colour and texture animate the building façade, and the use of jaunty cutouts allow light-circles to dance across the windows. And because it’s a public building, it’s designed to take a beating; to ensure it’ll look as good in 25 years as it does today, cladding is of robust, corrugated metal and tough, factory-coated wood.
Even the porch swing punches above its class: “It’s anchored with hooks onto a piece of steel to keep it from being vandalized,” Mr. Curran says, “but it also says ‘welcome’ and it’s kidheight.”
From porch swing to the sculpted outdoor playground out back, this is a city project that punches far above what it should. Architecturally dynamic and fun to look at, it champions the user experience while bringing much-needed life to this city on the rise … something kids of all ages can smile about.

Full text: DONE DEAL 328 Providence Ave., No. 5, Kelowna, B.C.
KETTLE VALLEY Asking price: $939,000 (Oct. 18); $899,999 (Nov. 29) Selling price: $885,000 (Dec. 16) Previous selling price: $450,000 (October, 2014) Days on the market: 59 Monthly maintenance fee: $378 Taxes: $3,542 (2023) Listing agent: Richard Deacon, Engel & Völkers Kelowna WHAT THEY GOT The three-bedroom, four-bathroom townhouse is in the desirable Kettle Valley neighbourhood of Kelowna, part of a 20-unit complex.
Although built in 2012, the three-storey 2,362-square-foot unit didn’t feel dated. It was well maintained and had a living area with 20-foot-high ceilings, heated floors, a built-in vacuum, a workout room, a private yard and a two-car garage, all of which made it a draw.
The subdivision was built by an American developer, so it has an American look to it, says listing agent Richard Deacon.
“A lot of Hallmark movies have been shot in this neighbourhood,” says Mr. Deacon. “It has that traditional architectural style inside and out.”
THE ACTION When it first hit the market in October, a high offer came in that was subject to the sale of the buyer’s home. The sellers turned it down, not wanting to tie up their listing with an uncertain offer.
It took another price reduction before a lower offer than the first one came through in December, after showing the unit to about 50 groups, most of them downsizers.
The local buyer had relatives in the neighbourhood.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “I thought it would sell at $900,000 or just under,” says Mr. Deacon, citing nearby competition. There weren’t many comparable townhouses, but there were houses. “You could still get a detached house in the area for that price point,” he said.
The sale completed Jan. 30.

Colorado teens build tiny homes for teachers: Student-built structures are a makeshift solution to housing prices that can leave educators with no affordable place to live

Full text: John Fisher steps into the shell of a small structure that his students have steadily been building into a future home for one of their teachers. The teenagers that walk the halls of his school, Aspen High, include the scions of America’s most storied business dynasties. Descendants of the families that built Hilton hotels and Walmart have attended this unique institution, with its parking lot that connects to a chairlift climbing the nearby slopes.
But the home these students are building would make a tight fit for corporate royalty. Mr. Fisher, the high school’s woodworking teacher, laughs when he describes its key feature: “Efficiency,” he says. “Obviously, it won’t be much to operate. Going to be cozy.”
The bedroom is a loft whose ceiling is little more than a metre high. On the main floor, a few strides is all it takes to move from the kitchen, to the living area, to the bathroom. “I guess the best way to describe it will be – unique,” Mr. Fisher says.
But in a country grappling with the cost of housing, what is taking shape in Aspen, Colo. is no outlier. For decades, employers in the U.S. have provided housing for some of their lowest-paid employees, such as temporary foreign workers brought in as agricultural labour.
As real estate prices have escalated, however, cities across the United States have begun to look at providing housing for teachers, too – an acknowledgment that home ownership is moving beyond the reach of a profession that employs millions of Americans.
In California, a law that went into effect this January makes it easier for school districts to use their own land to build housing for teachers and other staff members. San Francisco is adding hundreds of homes for teachers, which will be offered at belowmarket rental rates.
The school district in Austin, Tex., is working with a developer to add 500 housing units for teachers. In Atlanta, ground will be broken early this year on a “teachers village” with nearly 200 units. In Miami, a new school has teacher units built in. Even Indianapolis has added teacher housing.
U.S. teachers have long struggled with low salaries. Last year, the Colorado Education Association, the state’s largest union, surveyed its members and found that half report difficulty dealing with housing costs. “The erosion of the middle class is definitely happening – and the education profession is one where you can see it pretty dominantly,” said association president Amie Baca-Oehlert. Her union has advocated for better wages as the best solution.
But in Colorado and many other places, home prices have escalated far beyond salary increases. The Common Sense Institute, a free-enterprise research organization based in the state, has developed a Homebuyer Misery Index that ranks the state second in deterioration of housing affordability since 2009.
“Many of our educators report having to work two to three jobs just to make ends meet. We have educators who report to us that their own children qualify for free and reduced lunch,” Ms. Baca-Oehlert said.
In few places has affordability become more urgent than in Aspen, the snowy playground of the rich whose stratospheric real estate market has become the preserve of Hollywood stars and billionaires.
Rolls-Royces and ski-rackequipped Land Rovers ply the streets.
For school districts grappling with how to maintain sufficient staff, “we are kind of at the forefront,” said Christa Gieszl, president of the Aspen school board.
The Aspen School District has for many years provided some teacher housing. But it is in the midst of a major expansion. In 2020, local taxpayers approved a US$114-million bond to fund school upgrades and new staff housing, enough to provide homes – a mix of different sizes, in houses and apartments – for roughly a third of district employees. The district is now preparing to put forward another bond to build even more.
“We’re projecting that in 10 to 15 years, we’ll need pretty darn close to 100-per-cent housing” for staff, said David Baugh, the district superintendent. Mr. Baugh, a former fifth-grade teacher, now spends nearly a third of his time securing homes his staff can afford.
“It’s mission-critical,” he said. “If we can’t figure out housing, we won’t be able to figure out schooling. That’s how important it is.” In fact, he added, “it’s the number one challenge facing just about every superintendent in Colorado, whether you’re in a ski town, or downtown Denver or rural Colorado.”
He lives in district-supplied housing himself. For people of typical economic means in Aspen, “home ownership is just a distant dream – a distant memory of a dream,” he said.
Aspen’s education administrators are trying to keep teachers’ housing rent to about 20 per cent of their salaries. The district possesses advantages that teachers themselves don’t have: the ability to raise money from local taxpayers to buy homes; an exemption from property tax; and the ability to issue charitable tax receipts to landowners who sell at below-market rates, effectively shifting the burden of payment to other levels of government.
It also has the hammerswinging students, who are now helping to build the tiny home, which cost the district US$65,000. Another home is expected to begin construction this spring.
The district hopes to build one a year. The tight quarters could serve as first-year accommodations for new hires, who could then move into other housing.
“We don’t see that as an end-game solution. We see it as a point of entry, any port in the storm,” Mr. Baugh said.
Three other nearby school districts have also begun tiny home projects, backed by an outside funding group. For the Aspen students, it has been an educational opportunity far beyond the cutting boards, skis and Adirondack chairs they might otherwise make.
“I had no idea how to read a blueprint before or any of that – but I built all the framing for the house,” said Eli Kissel, a Grade 12 student who has been a leader in the tiny home construction. Students will wire and plumb the house, too. For Mr. Kissel, the gains in construction knowledge have come alongside a broader realization of the pressures on those not in the moneyed classes.
He works as a server at a local restaurant, where co-workers have described their difficulties in finding places to live. Accommodations like the tiny home are “kind of meeting that need,” he said. But he still finds its cramped quarters difficult to contemplate as a home. “It’s kind of crazy. I couldn’t imagine a teacher living in it fulltime,” he said.
Others have balked at Aspen’s teacher housing for different reasons. When Kim Zimmer moved into district housing in a rural area a 25-minute drive from the high school, a neighbour chained one of the access roads, saying it was a private drive.
“These people tried to push us out, thinking, ‘Oh these are teachers. They’re not our kind,’” she said.
With time, though, the neighbours have become more welcoming. The chain has long since disappeared and teachers have taken notice of local taxpayers agreeing to the multi-million-dollar bond to secure additional housing. “I feel very supported by our community,” Ms. Zimmer said. “Plus, I love living here.”
Still, not even the district sees the housing it provides as a panacea. Teachers must leave within a month of the completion of their employment. “You have to let somebody go and you’re taking their housing away, too. That’s really quite destructive,” Ms. Gieszl said.
And under current policy teachers can only live in district housing for up to five years.
These things are a central consideration for English teacher Diana Dame. She lived with her husband in a two-bedroom condo operated by the Aspen school district until complications from epilepsy forced her to withdraw from teaching. “When I put notice in, we had 30 days to leave,” she said.
“That was really difficult to navigate. I ended up having to move back in with family in Georgia.”
The couple now live closer to Denver and are deep in discussion about where to go next. They would like to buy a house.
“We’ve looked around the country,” she said, citing tough affordability math in Georgia, New York, Illinois, Colorado and Maine. “It’s kind of a dismal landscape, to be honest with you.”
Aspen, though, is never far from her mind. Returning would mean giving up some stability. In return, the family would be in a place whose outdoor beauty is augmented by the intellectual ferment of events like the Aspen Ideas Festival, which gifts tickets to teachers.
With district-provided housing, it might even make financial sense: Aspen teacher housing would cost about $1,000 a month less than what Ms. Dame is currently paying.
“We’re constantly trying to get back there,” she said. “They’re really doing an excellent job trying to make housing affordable.”

Full text: As Canadian theatres struggle with snowballing economic woes in the wake of COVID-19 lockdowns, performing arts associations in two of the country’s largest provinces are asking governments to boost their support.
On Thursday, prominent performing-arts associations from British Columbia and Ontario pleaded their case, seeking greater government contributions – or at least the continuation of pandemic-relief funding – so that the sector can offset higher costs in the face of lacklustre attendance.
Many theatre companies have struggled to get ticket-buyers to return – Winnipeg’s Prairie Theatre Exchange alone has seen a 57-per-cent drop in subscribers – as government pandemic-relief programs are tapering off and persistent inflation has pushed up costs for supplies, rent and talent.
As a result, theatre companies are putting on fewer shows, often with fewer performers and shorter runs; in several cases they’ve cancelled scheduled productions outright. Some are struggling to find rehearsal spaces, while theatre operators can hardly pay their bills. The Calgary Grand Theatre Society, for one, is on the cusp of losing its namesake space, and Blue Bridge Repertory Theatre in Victoria has had to leave the Roxy, the venue it bought, sold and then leased over the past decade. Other organizations are facing staff cuts.
“It’s bleak,” says Lisa Li, the Winnipeg theatre’s managing director, who also sits on the board of the Professional Association of Canadian Theatres, where dire economics are a subject of regular discussion. “The word ‘crisis’ has come up a few times.”
“People don’t have the same amount of money as they did prepandemic,” says Kenji Maeda, executive director of the Greater Vancouver Professional Theatre Alliance.
Vancouver’s Arts Club Theatre Company, for example, has seen its annual patron numbers decline to nearly 173,000 from 220,000 since the pandemic began, and took a $1-million loss last season. It’s since postponed a production of Cambodian Rock Band.
“New incentives or discounted tickets are strategies to get people back to the theatre, but that also affects the bottom line,” Maeda says.
His group has joined forces with other arts sectors’ associations to form the BC Coalition of Arts, Culture, and Heritage, which launched a public advocacy campaign Thursday to push for more sustainable government arts funding. They’re asking the provincial government to boost the core funding of the BC Arts Council to $55-million, from $39.6-million in 2022-23, to maintain $34.5-million in pandemic recovery funding for another two fiscal years and to develop more sustainable funding models.
In Ontario’s largest city, the Toronto Alliance for the Performing Arts – an arts service organization representing 117 professional theatre, dance and opera companies – has been warning municipal and provincial governments that reduced or even stagnant arts funding levels could spell disaster.
“TAPA is ringing the alarm bell,” executive director Jacoba Knaapen says.
The group has submitted a prebudget brief to Ontario’s Standing Committee on Finance and Economic Affairs, advocating for increased investment to the Ontario Arts Council of roughly 4 per cent over each of the next three years, “to account for future increases to inflation and population growth in the province.”
It also wrote to Toronto councillors, asking them to press Mayor Olivia Chow to honour a campaign commitment to increase the Toronto Arts Council’s budget by $2-million in 2024. In the end, the budget was passed with only an additional $800,000 spread out between the TAC and other culture organizations pending a new plan for the city’s culture sector.
A “perfect storm” of changes in consumer behaviours, rising costs and the lingering effects of the pandemic threaten the sector, Knaapen and Aubrey Reeves, president and chief executive officer of the national Business / Arts organization, said in a statement Thursday confirming its recent advocacy push. There’s an “unthinkable” question on minds across the sector, they wrote: “Are we on the verge of a major contraction, or worse, collapse?” Theatre companies themselves have been more quiet about the unfolding situation – which has affected them unevenly – not wanting to put off the audience members who are returning. (In a notable exception to the gloom, Crow’s Theatre and the Musical Stage Company’s production of Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812, an American musical, has become the longestrunning and most-successful show in both of those not-forprofit theatre companies’ histories.) Soulpepper Theatre Company, one of Toronto’s most prominent not-for-profits, quietly pulled two shows from its spring schedule in December to keep its budget balanced, while, in January, the smaller new-works company Factory Theatre cancelled a world premiere of In the Kitchen, which was to be a collaboration between the playwrights Fatuma Adar, Augusto Bitter, Olivier Choinière and Rosa Laborde, for the same reason. For both theatre companies, fall audience numbers were lower than expected after what had seemed to be an encouraging box-office bounceback the season before.
Still, the situation is worse elsewhere. Some performing-arts groups are already in the final stages of a death spiral.
The organization that ran Calgary’s Grand Theatre, the oldest such venue in Western Canada, sold it to Allied Properties Real Estate Investment Trust in 2021.
The Calgary Grand Theatre Society, which wanted to be a beacon for emerging local artists, was left as a tenant in the building that bore its name, and its financial woes only continued.
“Staff have done a great job of opening up the space, but the audience numbers are never what you’re hoping for,” says Devon LeClair, the society’s board chair.
The society’s leadership began drawing up a plan to partner with Arts Commons, a bigger theatre operator that LeClair says could have run the Grand as part of a suite of downtown spaces. But doing so would have required a new tenancy agreement and reduced rent in order to make the numbers work. The parties all tried to hash out an arrangement, but in January, LeClair says, they learned Allied wouldn’t accept the reduced-rent proposal.
Now, members of Calgary’s theatre scene fear losing the Grand space to another purpose, which has happened before: In the early 2000s, it was used as an indoor golfing facility.
“The last thing we want to see happen is for this essential piece of the Calgary arts community to be lost to something as wild as a golf dome,” LeClair says.
Two provinces over, seven positions at Winnipeg’s Prairie Theatre Exchange will be cut or consolidated next season as the company reckons with pandemic-relief programs such as the Canada Emergency Business Account coming to a close. “Without those, we’re left with business models that were informed by who we were before the pandemic, but in the reality of making theatre now,” artistic director Thomas Morgan Jones says.
Though new theatregoers have come to the PET, subscriptions and ticket sales are plummeting, and costs have risen about 30 per cent. Next season, the theatre is expecting revenues to come in at about $500,000 less than before the pandemic.
The board approved a deficit this season for the first time in two decades. But still they are looking at smaller-budget shows with fewer performers and shorter runs. Outside help would be a clear solution to their problem, says managing director Li: “Funding to arts councils needs to go up.”
The Quebec scene is going through many similar struggles.
Technical staff are leaving the sector for more stable jobs, and the real-estate crisis is also causing issues, says holly Greco, director of programming for the Quebec Drama Federation, which supports anglophone theatre companies and artists in the province.
“Being able to find spaces to rehearse, let alone put on a show, is continuing to be a challenge for independent companies.”
Greco points to Montreal’s Imago Theatre’s use of an empty pool as the venue for a November production of The Retreat as a creative solution. “I see theatre folks renting dance studios for their rehearsals,” she says.
This kind of cross-pollination between disciplines is happening across Canada – and the organizers of the new B.C. coalition hope that will make an impact when it comes to requests for funding.
“There’s been past criticism that the arts and culture sector is not connected,” Maeda says. Now, “we are collection of voices that are coming together.”

Full text: 457 Elm Rd., Toronto CRICKET CLUB Asking price: $2,799,000 (October, 2023) Selling price: $2,751,000 (November, 2023) Previous selling price: $1.68-million (January, 2015); $1.3-million (January, 2007) Taxes: $13,592 (2023) Days on the market: 22 Listing agents: Andre Kutyan and Robert Greenberg, Harvey Kalles Real Estate Ltd.
THE ACTION This four-bedroom house south of the Toronto Cricket Skating and Curling Club was priced below the local norm, largely on account of its location on a busy residential street. The sellers rejected a first offer that factored in a heavy discount.
When that same buyer came back with an improved offer a few weeks later, they were again rejected, as by this time a new buyer had made an offer closer to the asking price.
“Unfortunately for the first buyer, the second offer was stronger than the first one, and it was a firm deal,” said agent Andre Kutyan.
WHAT THEY GOT This two-storey home was built in 2007 and has 2,774 square feet of living space, plus a double garage accessed through the basement.
The living and dining rooms have 10-foot ceilings. There are also family rooms with gas fireplaces on the main and lower levels.
The eat-in kitchen has a long island, stainless-steel appliances and an exit to the backyard.
Upstairs, the primary bedroom has vaulted ceilings, a walkin closet and the largest of the home’s four bathrooms.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “It’s in a good school district and good proximity to amenities within walking distance,” said Mr. Kutyan.
“We’re on a 30-foot lot with a built-in, two-car garage and almost 2,800 square feet, whereas a lot of these homes we’re competing with were on 25-foot lots with single garages and were significantly smaller in terms of square footage, so there’s a lot of value in a house like this.”

Weak condo market in downtown Toronto leads to dip in rental rates, increased vacancy: With thousands of listings, some landlords say they’re having trouble finding tenants

Full text: THE LISTING In a country where rental affordability and vacancy rates got worse throughout 2023, how did rents fall and vacancy rates go up in the most expensive parts of downtown Toronto?
“Trust me when I tell you I’ve never experienced vacant units,” said Sundeep Bahl, a Toronto realtor with Re/Max Plus City Team, who specializes in buying and selling investor-owned condominiums and also provides his own property management services.
“We get 60 days notice [from a tenant vacating] and we’ve expired the 60 days. The unit’s now become vacant and we can’t find a tenant for the landlord.”
According to condo market analysts Urbanation Inc., condo rents fell 5.7 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2023, the fastest drop since it began recording rental data in 2010. It doesn’t take prices back to where they were before a 10-per-cent increase in the earlier part of 2023, but the only recent comparable drop is the shortterm exodus Toronto saw in the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020.
The dip in the downtown rental market has a lot to do with where Canada’s biggest market for condominium apartments finds itself at: Sales of unbuilt condos have reached rarely seen lows, the resale market is facing falling prices, and at the same time there are more newly completed units being added to the market every quarter. Urbanation says the number of new condos delivered in the final quarter of 2023 hit 7,408 units, up 26 per cent from the previous year. And the projection for the first quarter of 2024 looks to be about the same, or larger.
According to Mr. Bahl, that means there are at least 3,600 condo apartments up for rent in the two most dense downtown districts (known as C01 and C08 by local realtors) and close to 60 per cent of them are sitting vacant.
“They’re cannibalizing each other,” said Pauline Lierman, vice-president of market research with Zonda Urban. “It’s not the first time we’ve had cannibalization in certain neighbourhood pockets. But at that scale, it really makes a difference.”
The current market is an adjustment for landlords who bought Toronto condos to rent out as the condo universe became the most expensive rental category, according to data from the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. With a sudden glut of condos, plus more than 5,500 recently opened purpose-built rental apartments, there is more competition for the top tenants.
“They are so used to just a single-occupant, triple-A qualified tenants who make $90,000$100,000,” said Mr. Bahl of his investors, who he said are losing patience with his inability to even schedule showings. “It’s really a struggle finding somebody qualified at this point.”
It’s also been a struggle to push landlords to consider dropping below what was the going rate of $2,200-$2,400 for a downtown condo. Anecdotally, one of Mr. Bahl’s clients who agreed to list “below market” at $2,100 had a tenant within two weeks.
The falling rents are just one more sign of a struggling condo market after a year that had some of the lowest sales volumes in modern history.
According to Zonda Urban, there were nearly 15,000 sales of preconstruction condominium apartments in the Greater Toronto Area last year – down 36 per cent from 2022. Urbanation Inc.
had a slightly lower number of sales for the GTA, putting the figure at around 12,600, but still said last year was only the third time in the past two decades that sales were below 13,000 units. The long-term trend, the firm said, has been close to 25,000 units.
In the City of Toronto, things were even starker: The 6,498 units sold in 2023 is a drop of 48 per cent from 2022 and marked another 20-year low.
Worse is the rate at which new units are being absorbed by the market. Urbanation records 22,000 unsold preconstruction units at the end of 2023, which is roughly 21 months of inventory (or double the normal market amount). It found 31 per cent of projects sold less than 30 per cent of their units. “Two years earlier in Q4-2021, there were no preconstruction projects that were less than 30 per cent sold.”
According to Zonda, price is the key determining factor for which project is going to sell. “Of the 6,819 apartment units brought to the market in the fourth quarter, 26 per cent sold at an average of $1,334 [per square foot], or $816,101.” In 19 new project launches, 45 per cent of sales were for units that came in under $1,200 per square foot.
“Condo projects are recalibrating, pricing is coming down,” said Ms. Lierman. “I have a [project] where they’re probably coming down $100 per square foot, just to keep things moving.”
Zonda also recorded 1,400 condo units that either saw efforts to pause sales indefinitely or get cancelled outright in the fourth quarter of 2023, with another 1,100 in receivership and facing cancellation.
Even in the resale market, prices are trending down even as sales tick up.
According to the most recent Toronto Regional Real Estate Board data for Toronto’s condo market, unit sales in January, 2024, were up 46 per cent from January, 2023, but the average sale price so far in 2024 ($709,419) was essentially flat, down 0.24 per cent from last year ($711,171).
Inventory is another likely cause, as the volume of available listings was up 28 per cent in year over year (from 2,494 to 3,215 active listings). Those listings are also spending more time on the market, up an average eight days longer in 2024 compared with 2023.
The other signal Ms. Lierman is watching closely is preconstruction buyers walking away from deposits. She said Zonda hasn’t seen anything statistically significant, but did note that she’s been told of an uptick buyers defaulting if they came in late in the sales cycle with a deposit of 5 per cent in 2022 for condos that are now finished. Such buyers were likely hoping to flip units on the assignment market and were unable to find takers for units that cost upwards of $1,900 a square foot.
“There was a lot of exuberance, in the sense that this – price escalation – would just continue,” said Ms. Lierman. “Not now, not now.”

A ‘democratic’ take on modern architecture: Bob Lewis-designed house in West Vancouver offers mid-century architecture with recent finishing touches

Full text: 6926 Marine Dr.
WEST VANCOUVER Asking Price: $2.8-million Taxes: $5,101 (2023) Lot Size: 75 by 125 feet Listing agent: Sue Scott, Engels and Volkers THE BACKSTORY If you’re a fan of mid-century architecture and you live in the Vancouver area, the name Bob Lewis is a meaningful one. And the idea of an “undiscovered” Lewis is even more meaningful.
That’s one of the things that attracted art director Talia Cohen and furniture designer Christian Woo to the 1950s post-andbeam house on Marine Drive in West Vancouver when they first saw it nine years ago. Ms. Cohen had a friend who owned a Lewis and there were strong hints this house was one, too.
“There were elements of the panelling and the way he was doing the balcony, he had a lot of classic indications around his building style in the fifties and sixties he used,” Ms. Cohen said. “We were like, you know, it doesn’t matter: I think it’s probably a Lewis, let’s just go for it.”
When the couple found the original plans for the building, there was another address on them. Only after some review was it clear that the address was a mistake likely made by the city planning office.
Mr. Lewis isn’t a household name across Canada like some mid-century modern designers, and his homes were not designed to be expensive and showy. Articles from the time when he was building in the 1950s and 60s describe that one of his chief motivations for using his flat-roofed post-andbeam designs was accessibility: he was able to build for close to 20-per-cent less per square foot than other home types that require interior walls. He was also prolific; according to local preservationist researchers, there are probably more than 200 examples of his homes in the Lower Mainland.
“I’m by no means a Lewis expert. I think he just made modern architecture democratic,” Ms. Cohen said.
That doesn’t mean everyone appreciates them; a number of these homes have been torn down to make way for larger structures. This house is relatively small with just more than 2,000 square feet spread equally over two floors.
“Only in recent years, people have really started to appreciate modernist architecture of this era,” she said. They’ve been doing projects on the house over the years, identifying needs as they’ve lived in the space, but none of it was intended to replace what Mr. Lewis started.
“What I really like about this house is, other than changing the palette of it and putting in all those built-ins and all these kind of cosmetic upgrades, nothing integral about the house actually changed,” she said. “People think it’s this complete overhaul but the reality is that it’s not at all.
The building is just so timeless in its capacity to absorb any kind of like palette that you apply to it. It truly is a canvas.”
THE HOUSE TODAY The Whytecliff neighbourhood is part of a small peninsula that juts off Horseshoe Bay on the North Shore near at the entrance the Burrard Inlet. It’s a heavily forested area with roads that wind though mountainous terrain, and the house sits on an angle from the road, down a short drive into a courtyard surrounded by blackstained screen fencing.
“All the screening in our courtyard in the front, and under the deck, it’s all the same two-by-twos, and our fence is all that, all screen,” Ms. Cohen said. “It took us a year and a half to find someone to do it, it’s so labour intensive. But it’s great, there’s so much privacy and light.”
The cedar cladding of the house is also stained dark so the lighter wood of the roofed entryway screen is welcoming and bright with a skylight above pulling more light through. To the left of the front door is a window and glass door into a separated studio or office, with separate storage as well.
A large window into the main house looks onto the stairs rising to the second floor, while through the steel door is an entryway with more privacy screen and builtin walnut bench. The walls and exposedbeam ceiling are all white, while the floor is a dark walnut.
A wall of the same dark walnut is the back half of the centrally situated kitchen cabinetry. As you slip around on either side, you see this bank contains fridge, mounted oven and a bar/prep space, as well as upper and lower pantry storage. Opposite the dark cabinets and installed against the rear wall – which is all windows and windowed doors – is a bank of pristine white cabinets with sink and range facing the backyard. Even the vent hood is clad in white.
Flanking this central kitchen is the dining space on one side and the living room space on the opposite, which are also connected via the 60-foot-long deck that runs along the length of the outside wall. Ms. Cohen said they often leave the doors on this level open, letting the breeze, children and pets flow through naturally.
“When you’re downstairs, you feel like you’re outside,” Ms. Cohen said. The first job they undertook when they bought the house was to rehabilitate the landscaping, which had been reduced to straggles of dead grass.
As suggested by the name, the beams in the ceiling run to posts on the outside walls, giving the space a geometric, gridlike orderliness. Typically, flooring planks run down the longer side of a space, but one thing the couple did to draw the eye toward the outdoor space is arrange the planks so they run along the shorter length, from streetside wall to rear windows.
Upstairs, there are more white walls, but the flooring is beige carpeting that offers a little extra quiet and a more relaxing tone.
At the top of the stairs is a bank of built-in storage cabinets and desk space under a small window. Behind that, a hallway runs along the front side of the house connecting all the rooms, with one side clad in white planks that mirror the exposed planks in the ceiling.
There are three bedrooms, with about a third of the upper level occupied by the primary suite. The middle bedroom is the smallest, and the second bedroom has access to the rear balcony, which has a glass railing to keep clear sightlines.
The primary suite also accesses the rear balcony. It is spare and minimally furnished with a wall of white built-ins. Behind a pocket door is a large ensuite bath with two walls and a floor clad in the same white two-by-two tiles, creating a wetroom shower. There’s a square raised soaker tub along the black-stained wood wall underneath a skylight, with a sleek white vanity mounted on the second blackstained wood wall beneath a mirror that rises to a bulkhead of those same two-bytwo dowel-screens seen elsewhere in the home. The other bathroom on this level, a shared one for the other rooms, has the same screen bulkhead but has a black-tiled floor and glassed-in shower enclosure beneath another skylight.
FINISHING TOUCHES Sharp-eyed observers may also have noted there’s no crown moulding or baseboards anywhere in the house. Only baseboard heaters break up the symmetry and lines of each of the spaces. That kind of perfection of build and installation is hard to achieve, and they like showing it off.
Mr. Woo’s expertise as a furniture designer also fills the home, down to a symmetry of things such as the dowels used in the kitchen and elsewhere.
“Anywhere there’s a dowel or a handle, it’s the exact same diameter. Christian uses a lot of dowels in his work,” Ms. Cohen said.
The artwork that has filled the house has also been carefully curated over the years for each of the available spaces. There’s really not a stitch of space in the home that isn’t exactly as the couple desires it.
Which brings to mind their primary motivation to move.
“It’s come down to: Christian just wants another project. It’s come to the point where it feels complete,” Ms. Cohen said.
“Most people would think it’s great, the house is finished. My parents are like, ‘Why are you guys moving?’ But when you’re artists at heart and a creator at heart, you want to do another one. Why not?”

Full text: VANCOUVER Vancouver’s housing crisis is exacerbated by federal policies that are creating increased demand for mortgage debt and resale housing, says a senior economist who spent six years at the Bank of Canada and is now vice-president of policy for the Business Council of B.C.
Oxford educated David Williams, who is president of the Association of Professional Economists of B.C., said the current argument that the housing affordability crisis, or the disconnect between household incomes and the price of resale homes, is largely due to a lack of supply is flawed.
That’s because it does not distinguish resale home prices from newly built home prices, which are two related but separate markets with different pressures, he says. New home prices reflect construction costs, city taxes, municipal levies and other costs, while abrupt changes in resale prices are principally driven by demand, he says.
And the resale home market is much bigger than the new home market, which is homes built within the last year. “It’s best to think of resale homes as a vast asset market, with some proportion of it changing hands each year to set the price,” says Mr. Williams.
Mr. Williams created a table that uses census and mortgage credit data and he looks at demand side and supply side indicators for resale home prices versus new home prices.
When adjusted for inflation, resale home prices went up 46 per cent over the five-year stretch between the censuses of 2016 and 2021, while new home prices only went up 8 per cent.
“A lot of economists make this mistake. They blend it all together and we can’t tell which market they are talking about,” he says.
“It’s a very big difference.
“When people talk about affordable housing, they are talking about 98 per cent of the housing stock built yesterday. New homes are built this year, that’s a tiny amount of the stock.”
That difference also reveals the impact of foreign capital on Vancouver’s housing market. Mr. Williams has another chart he uses in presentations that shows since 2005 Vancouver detached resale homes have always traded at a premium compared to the national average, at about two or 2.5 times the national price, so it’s always been an attractive market.
However, it climbs to three times the national average by 2015. With the introduction of the B.C. foreign buyer tax in 2016, there’s a severe drop in that ratio, and when B.C. introduces new housing policies aimed at curbing foreign capital demand around 2018, the ratio drop continues down to around 2.4 times the national average. Since 2005, resale condo units and townhomes are selling consistently at 1.4 and 1.6 times the national average, respectively. The slowing of Chinese capital into the market would have also played a role. The ratio is now climbing back up again to around 2.5 due to recent federal immigration policies and Vancouver’s role as a gateway city for newcomers.
“It also shows that this is really about demand, and that’s really what drives resale home prices,” says Mr. Williams. “When you are talking about resale home prices, it’s really an asset market, and the supply of those assets at any point in time except in the long run is fixed. So it highlights the role that federal stimulus for demand has played in driving resale home price increases in recent times.”
And that asset class is going up in price for the simple reason that there is a lot of money being thrown at it, which has become staggering.
“What is really remarkable is that in the last three years, Canada added about $450-billion worth of mortgage credit,” he says. “There is more money chasing it, and yet we hear almost nothing from the federal government about that.
“The root of all this is the federal government has been stoking the demand side, and that is what really drives the resale home price, over most periods except the very, very long run – I’m talking decades. Most time periods, it’s the federal government responsible for cranking up demand for credit, chasing that asset class, and chasing demand for homes from newcomers, who may bring additional sources of capital with them, not available to people already here. All of that drives up the price, because you have more money coming in chasing that asset class.”
It’s no coincidence, therefore, that Canada has the highest ratio of resale home prices relative to household incomes.
He also makes the point that as far as supply goes, Canada is faring pretty well. Between 2016 and 2021, there was a 37-per-cent increase in total housing starts. For apartments alone, there was a 63per-cent increase.
“That’s massive,” he notes.
The problem with blaming the crisis entirely on a supply shortage is that it assumes demand will stay the same, he says.
“If densification alone was the answer to bring down resale home prices, then Hong Kong and New York would be two of the cheapest cities in the world to live, in terms of resale home prices to income.”
Using data supplied by the Canadian Housing Statistics Program, Mr. Williams found that about 10 per cent of B.C.’s housing stock built after 2016 is partially or wholly owned by non-resident homeowners. In Vancouver, it’s around 15 per cent; in Richmond it’s 18 to 20 per cent; Burnaby and Coquitlam, around 13 to 19 per cent.
“This is the central point I want to make,” says Mr. Williams. “It’s about the amount of money that is chasing this asset class of resale homes. That’s probably why we care about non-resident buyers.
It’s not the person [buyer] who is of interest here. If the policy goal is to have resale home prices that are more related to local incomes, so then we care about extra money coming into the system – whether that’s coming from loans or whether it is coming from equity being brought from abroad. Either way, it doesn’t reflect Canadians’ earnings.”
Josh Gordon, who is a visiting research fellow in the digital society lab at McMaster University, followed up on Mr. Williams’s analysis in a social-media post to highlight the effects of foreign capital on Vancouver’s market.
He determined that “foreign capital inflows helped generate a relative overvaluation of around 30 to 40 per cent,” from 2014 to 2018.
In his post, he noted that that’s a home value increase that goes far beyond what government and housing pundits had said at the time.
Perhaps a sign of the times, and a reflection of the investor-driven market, is the recent receivership of a major downtown property that had been purchased in 2018.
A judge ruled that the owners, who’d proposed a 55-storey condo tower and rental midrise at 1045 Haro St., must now sell the property to pay off a bank loan.
Sales for the 60-storey luxury Passive House Curv tower on Burrard Street are still underway, according to marketer Jacky Chan, who says he sold a couple of units at $4,500 a square foot just this month. But Mr. Chan says they are also looking to a new rush of foreign capital to help buoy sales once the federal government’s two-year foreign buyer ban is lifted this summer.
“We are still plowing through and expect to have another surge of sales around and after Chinese New Year’s and all the way to summer and gearing up for [the] lifting of [the] foreign buyer ban and all the pent-up demand will rush in,” he said in an e-mail.

Full text: THE LISTING The collapse of the Vandyk group of companies appears total now after a court-appointed receiver seeking to recover more than $350-million owed to lenders has been installed on all the significant properties of the troubled builder.
The eight sites now declared insolvent represent more than 2,000 unbuilt homes, the majority sold to preconstruction buyers who are now uncertain about whether or when they will get back deposits pledged to those purchases. In some cases, the deposits appear to be insured. In other cases lenders have alleged buyer deposit funds have been misused.
The latest court filings paint the clearest picture yet of when Vandyk began to drown in red ink. They also show that some lenders knew about the company’s financial struggles months before the company stopped paying suppliers and started defaulting on loans.
The most recent appointments involve sites near the Mimico GO Transit station in the Toronto district of Etobicoke that Vandyk was hoping to develop into a development known as The Buckingham – Grand Central. That project was to comprise more than 600 apartments spread across three towers. Vandyk relied on multiple lenders to finance the purchase of the land around that site, racking up huge debts it then struggled to service.
According to filings, on Dec. 12, Otéra Capital Inc. – a development lending arm of Quebec pension fund Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec – won the appointment of KSV Advisory Inc. to collect $84.35-million it says it lent Vandyk to help the developer purchase 39 Newcastle St., which is adjacent to the Mimico GO station.
The Otéra loan was advanced on July 4, 2022, as part of an $89-million deal to buy the land from CIC Management Services Inc., a company connected to John Zanini, president of Toronto-based Dunpar Homes that had previously applied to build a condo building on the same site.
Vandyk was to provide $23.2-million in cash equity for its share of the purchase, but CIC also extended Vandyk a $25-million vendor takeback mortgage against the property as part of the sale.
The land deal came with a Ministerial Zoning Order – a sometimes controversial power reserved by the province of Ontario and obtained by Mr. Zanini’s company in April of 2022 – that overrode a dozen of the City of Toronto’s local zoning bylaws and allowed for vastly increased density. The project served as a showcase for Doug Ford’s Conservative government policy of upzoning for “transit-oriented developments.”
In an affidavit attached to the filing, Leonard Damiani, a vicepresident of Otéra Capital Inc., said that in February of 2023 his company first signalled to Vandyk that it would need to increase by about $2-million a prepaid interest reserve fund before it would consider extending the loan beyond the one-year maturity date. In April, Otéra demanded a “comprehensive update regarding the Vandyk Group’s financial position including liquidity position and project cost reports so as to confirm no material unfunded overruns.” The “comprehensive” update never came, but by May 19 Vandyk sent a liquidity report that suggested its finances were “constrained” and that starting in September it would no longer be able to service its various debt obligations.
True to the prediction, Vandyk stopped making the monthly $1.26-million loan payments to Otéra in September. On Sept. 29, Otéra sent enforcement letters to Vandyk demanding repayment, due on Oct. 9. Along the way, Mr. Damiani said that Vandyk’s principals made representations about a possible deal to refinance partly constructed projects or sell the Mimico-related lands. According to the affidavit, none of those alleged deals came to fruition.
According to Mr. Damiani’s affidavit, he had a meeting with John C. Vandyk (the company’s founder and CEO) at Vandyk’s office on Sept. 24, a Sunday, where he was warned that other Vandyk projects were in distress. That included an admission that its Lakeview DXE site had experienced cost overruns of $15-million.
In more meetings between Otéra executives and Vandyk leadership on Oct. 18 and 19, Otéra learned that other development lenders, Kingsett Capital and MCAP, issued notices of intention to enforce security on loans worth more than $200-million related to the other parts of the Buckingham project, as well other sites known as Kings Mill, Backyards and Uptowns. Vandyk principals are reported to have claimed that cost overruns on these other projects had passed $7-million at the Uptowns and $10-million at The Buckingham.
Two other recent appointments also revolve around the Buckingham/Mimico Go project.
In August, 2020, MCAP lent Vandyk $37-million to refinance a series of other loans for the Buckingham North tower site at 23 Buckingham St. As part of the loan, founder John Vandyk pledged to MCAP shares of his company. On Jan. 18, KSV was appointed receiver to take over that site in hopes of securing the $38million MCAP says it is owed.
Among the creditors are construction firms with more than $2.5-million liens against the property, and according to MCAP’s filing, Vandyk also neglected to pay property taxes on the land.
On Oct. 28, 2022, a Vandyk shell company – 1000318652 Ontario Inc. also known as 41 Wabash Ltd. – borrowed $9-million from Fiera FP Real Estate Financing Fund, L.P. – an arm of the global asset manager and publicly traded Fiera Capital Corp. – to purchase more land adjacent to the Mimico Go station (48, 50 and 52 Newcastle St.) and secured a $14-million construction loan as well.
On Oct. 31, amid the company’s struggles to refinance, Vandyk took out a second mortgage of $30-million on the Newcastle lands from Diversified Capital Inc., a private lender. On Jan. 23, 2023, Fiera won the appointment of KSV to recover $18.8-million it says Vandyk owes it.
Amid the filings, there are also two separate reports of times when Vandyk is alleged to have diverted funds intended for one project to other uses. Kingsett alleged that $37-million – in a mix of borrowed money and purchaser deposits for the Uptowns and Lakeview projects – were misused. MCAP received a report from BDO that said upwards of $11-million had been diverted from Backyards to other accounts. No civil or criminal complaints have been filed concerning these allegations.
None of the allegations against Vandyk have been proven in court. No one from Vandyk or its various lenders responded to requests for comment.

A modern take on an ancient technique: Using rammed earth for walls dates back to Neolithic Age, proves adaptable to our times

Full text: PRINCE EDWARD COUNTY, ONT.
The thermostat reads 18 C.
The thermostat, it should be noted, is sitting on the windowsill of the bathroom. It should also be noted that, because of a faulty part, the heat pump has not been working for two weeks. And despite the recent above-zero temperatures, it is still January in Ontario.
“Let that resonate,” Graham Cavalier, general manager of Aerecura Sustainable Builders, says to the assembled crowd of about 65 people. “Please imagine what that would be like, waking up in any of the homes that you live in, if you did not have access to heat for two weeks.”
There is a collective shiver at the thought.
But in Heather Boyd’s newly constructed house on Salmon Point Road in Prince Edward County, Ont., about 220 kilometres east of downtown Toronto, it’s as toasty as a late spring day. The home’s walls measure a total of 20 inches thick – six inches of rammed earth on the outside followed by six inches of expanded polystyrene insulation and then eight more inches of rammed earth.
Aerecura founder and chief executive officer Sylvia Cook adds that the assembled crowd is helping: “At the moment, you guys are providing tremendous amounts of heat that is going to benefit Heather for weeks to come. All of your BTUs are getting absorbed by the rammed earth, and, as it gets cooler in here later, that will come back out.”
That’s the thing about rammed earth. It’s logical. It works. And it’s ancient. Evidence of rammed earth has been found as far back as the Neolithic Age, and in Ontario, the oldest known example is near Barrie in Shanty Bay: St. Thomas Anglican Church, built in 1841. That’s why, when Ms. Cook, a physicist and teacher, was looking for a building method to use for her abode more than a dozen years ago, she glommed onto rammed earth and built the province’s first insulated example, while founding the company with her son, Mr. Cavalier, at the same time.
The process, Mr. Cavalier says, is deceptively simple: After the foundation is made, forms wide enough for a person to stand in are constructed; local sand and gravel is poured in, a little at a time, which is then compressed using pneumatic tools; in that mix is 5-per-cent cement as well as a waterproofing agent; the artistry comes from tints that are added to create the “waves,” which can be “any colour based on the additives.”
“The complexity of creating rammed earth has a lot more to do with ensuring proper compaction,” he continues. “You can hear it, you can feel it when you’ve properly compacted it, and that comes with experience.” He then points to a few reddish bands in particular behind him on Ms. Boyd’s feature wall. “Each of these started out about 30 per cent taller … so there’s a fair amount of labour that goes into these.”
And that labour costs. In this case, $1.2-million for construction. But, then again, Ms. Boyd’s house is really two rammed earth houses, one of 1,800 square feet and another of 950 square feet, joined together (in the middle) by a non-rammed earth sunroom of 450 square feet. The rationale is that she and her husband, Dennis Baril, will live in the main house, and, while they’re still spry, treat the smaller house as a guesthouse. When they become much older, a livein caretaker can occupy the 950sq.-ft. house comfortably and independently when not needed.
It will be a good place to age.
Not only do rammed earth buildings keep a consistent temperature (of about 18 C) no matter the season, they’re also pin-drop quiet, fireproof, floodproof, and mould and mildew-proof.
So why aren’t all buildings built this way?
“I believe every municipal building, every public works building, every hospital should be,” says Ms. Boyd, a licensed trademark agent and owner of Pillar IP. “Do you see any drywall in this house? Drywall is the devil, it causes so many allergies. … I came here and I have no allergies any more.” And, since rammed earth can reach up to four storeys without requiring “different engineering” (according to Mr. Cavalier), it would seem logical to start with hospitals, at the very least.
As the speakers take a break (the open house was hosted by Aerecura and Chestnut Park’s Faye Moxam), most attendees break off into little tour groups.
And almost every person – at Ms. Boyd’s encouragement – reaches out and strokes the surprisingly smooth walls. They’re cool to the touch and feel as solid as a bank vault. They instill a sense of peace and reassurance.
When the crowd reconvenes, they meet architect E. Jane Wilson via Ms. Boyd’s laptop; Ms. Wilson lives near Ottawa and couldn’t make the drive. She says: “We have a lot of places where things like fire and major storms have a real impact on our lives, so we have to build with that in mind. … The goal is not to have a box that you feel like you have to change the bathroom every 3½ years to keep up with fashion. You need to think futuristically, to be able to make something that is going to last, and be valid, and be loved, for quite a while.”
And since rammed earth walls must be joined to windows, doors, floors and a roof (this one is made of prefab panels by Canadian company Simple Life), adding the skill of a LEED-certified architect to the mix is a necessity.
As attendees say their goodbyes and exchange those sheltering walls for the windy, cold and humid walk to their cars, another necessity comes to light: the need to spread the word.

Canada sees surge of hotel construction: Vancouver seen as most attractive bet for development, as the country’s leader in hotel profits, occupancy

Full text: Canada is seeing a surge of hotel construction in major cities, with Vancouver leading the way in new building applications after the tough pandemic years, when hotels seemed like the iffiest of all real estate investments.
There were 294 projects – a total of 38,000 rooms – in the works across the country as of the end of last year, according to development consultancy Lodging Econometrics.
And while Toronto has the largest number under construction – a total of 9,391 rooms, including projects such as the 392room Curio by Hilton in the Distillery District and the Nobu Hotel and Residences, both due to open this year – new approvals for hotels have slowed down significantly, with only one in the two previous years and the city still processing four applications from 2019 through 2022.
Vancouver is now seen as the most attractive bet by analysts because it leads the way in hotel profits and occupancy, which was almost 80 per cent in October.
“We’ve identified Vancouver as being the No. 1 leader” when it comes to the revenue generated per room, said Alam Pirani, the head of the hotels division at Colliers, a real estate brokerage in Toronto. “We’re seeing things coming back – group businesses, small meetings, everything.”
That’s a reversal of the trend of a decade ago, when several hotel owners in the city converted their properties to rental apartments.
The combination of steadily escalating prices and high occupancy, several international events on the horizon, a drumbeat at Vancouver city council about doing everything possible to fix a much-documented hotel shortage and incoming provincial restrictions on short-term accommodations appear to have worked some magic.
There are now 23 projects and 4,317 rooms in the works, the majority of them in central Vancouver.
Bosa Properties formally announced last week that it is partnering with the owner of the popular Listel Hotel on Robson Street on a new building that will double the number of rooms in the current hotel and, in a first for the city, add rental apartments on top.
Amacon Developments has two projects on the books, one of them a conversion of a medical building at Burrard and Davie streets.
A new company called QWID Capital Partners has started construction on the first-ever hotel in Vancouver’s beleaguered Chinatown, next to the popular Keefer Bar.
Langley-based Marcon Construction is about to go to council to seek approval for one of the largest hotel projects proposed in Vancouver in a decade – 32 storeys, 578 rooms – on Pender Street, a couple of blocks from the massive new Amazon-leased office tower at the former main post office.
And Deecorp Properties, a company that owns a lot of land in Vancouver that has seen little redevelopment, has proposed two hotel buildings for a site near Granville and Davie streets.
The building boom is being welcomed by city councillors, the tourism sector, the restaurant industry – and Chinatown, where people are thrilled it will be getting its first hotel.
“For us, it’s exciting. It will really bring visitors and attract people to the neighbourhood,” said Jordan Eng, president of the Vancouver Chinatown Business Improvement Association.
Mr. Pirani said many of the new hotel developments throughout the country, including those in Vancouver, are predominantly boutique hotels, otherwise known as “focused service” hotels – smaller, with few amenities.
But projects such as the Marcon proposal are the big, old-fashioned kind, with banquet and conference rooms. The redeveloped Listel Hotel will have meeting rooms, a swimming pool, a Japanese-inspired plunge pool, a fitness centre and its usual high level of staffing, said John Nicholson, vice-president of the Listel Hospitality Group.
As many other hotel developers have done, Listel and Bosa Properties have planned a project that combines hotel rooms with long-term housing to help smooth out any hotel-revenue bumps.
“Rental is easier to finance than all hotel,” said Marc Ricou, a vice-president at Bosa. “Hotels are quite economically sensitive, so it’s a way to diversify and reduce the risk.”
Additionally, Listel decided that rentals were a safer option than condos in today’s market, Mr. Nicholson said.
He said one of the big impetuses for Listel to redevelop was when the plan for the West End neighbourhood, which encompasses Robson Street, changed the development potential of the site in 2011. That immediately tripled the hotel’s tax bill and got the owners thinking of going bigger.
Analysts say there are many other reasons hotels have become popular again.
They were already at high occupancy even before the pandemic, in part because some – the Palisades on Robson, the Coast Plaza Hotel on Davie and the Plaza Hotel near city hall, for example – had been converted into rental apartments in the previous decade.
Then, during the pandemic, several mid- or low-priced hotels, such as the Best Western on Kingsway and the Patricia Hotel on Hastings, were purchased by the province to house homeless people.
An inventory done by Destination Vancouver in early 2022 showed the region had a total of 23,333 rooms, with about half of those in the central downtown. It estimated that another 20,000 were needed.
University of British Columbia adjunct marketing professor Jarrett Vaughan said hotel developers have also likely been encouraged by the province’s aggressive crackdown on short-term rentals, as well as the return of high occupancy and high prices in the past year.
But he said they’re developing different kinds of projects. Instead of traditional hotels, they’re focusing on visitors’ desires to have interesting local experiences and meals or services such as spas and wellness centres.
Many developers are also incorporating hotels into multiuse projects, sometimes as part of city requirements for commercial space, sometimes to expand the range of their portfolios.
Developers are also increasingly becoming hotel managers, unlike the days when they relied almost exclusively on condo sales.
“It’s a very intensive business, but once you build out and restructure, the business begins to grow,” said Stepan Vdovine, a vice-president at Amacon.
And, most importantly, hotel rates are pleasantly high.
That may not be welcome news for potential visitors, who are increasingly less likely to find anything even moderately priced in central Vancouver.
Developers and analysts say the budget option is increasingly unlikely.
“Vancouver and Toronto are two markets where it’s hard to justify building those,” Mr. Pirani said.
Instead, tourists looking for cheaper accommodations will have to go to the suburbs, he said.
And there will be more options for them as limited-service models from the big chains, such as Holiday Inn Express or Home2 Suites by Hilton, take over there.
Unless, of course, visitors choose Vancouver’s historic, cityowned 2400 Motel on Kingsway, currently renting for as little as $150 a night.

Falling home prices, lower fixed-rate mortgages spur affordability gains in some markets

Full text: Lower home prices and declining interest rates on new fixed-rate mortgages are starting to translate into affordability gains in some Canadian cities, a Globe analysis has found.
While many Canadian cities have seen sizable home price drops over much of 2022 and 2023, soaring borrowing costs over that period have, until recently, wiped out any affordability gains for homebuyers.
But with lenders lowering fixed rates on new five-year mortgages over the past two months, that’s beginning to change.
The Globe and Mail compared the mortgage payments homebuyers would have to carry if they purchased an average-priced home in their local market today to what they’d have paid if they’d bought in February, 2022, right before the Bank of Canada began its rate-hiking campaign. In a handful of housing markets, those payments would be lower, the numbers show.
The analysis shows it currently takes a home price decline of around 25 per cent or more from February two years ago to produce a mortgage payment decrease of more than $100 a month.
But the good news for homebuyers is limited. The gains are typically modest and concentrated in mid-sized cities and smaller communities in Ontario, which saw the sharpest housing corrections since early 2022.
And in the absence of sizable increases to the housing supply, any affordability gains are likely to be short-lived, with buyer demand bound to quickly push up prices, CIBC Capital Markets deputy chief economist Benjamin Tal said, commenting on The Globe’s analysis.
“What we’re seeing now is a situation in which we are planting the seeds for some increasing prices down the road,” Mr. Tal said.
The Globe calculated mortgage payments in more than 20 markets tracked by the Canadian Real Estate Association. The analysis relies on estimates of the price of a typical home in February, 2022, and in December, 2023, the latest available data.
To calculate mortgage payments at the peak of the pandemic housing boom, The Globe used a rate of 2.94 per cent.
That was the lowest nationally available five-year fixed rate for purchases that don’t require mortgage default insurance in mid-February of 2022, according to MortgageLogic.news.
For an estimate of mortgage payments for today’s buyers, The Globe used a 5.29-per-cent rate, the current lowest five-year fixed rate. The calculations assume buyers have a 20-per-cent down payment and will take 25 years to pay off the mortgage.
Those steep price declines are mostly found in Ontario. In Cambridge, for example, where prices have dropped 28 per cent from their peak, a buyer today would likely face monthly mortgage payments around $300 lower for a typical home. Buyers will find similar conditions in London, Waterloo, Hamilton and Oakville.
The province also dominates the ranking of markets where prices have fallen by around 20 per cent, which currently produces mortgage payments that are roughly equal to those buyers faced two years ago, before the central bank began raising rates.
Chilliwack, B.C., is the only city outside of Ontario among those analyzed to also exhibit these conditions.
In much of the rest of Canada, buyers are still contending with higher mortgage payments. In Halifax, for example, the monthly payment on a typical home is still roughly $400 higher, even though home prices are 6 per cent lower.
In Calgary, where prices are up 10 per cent since February, 2022, a new buyer would have to shoulder nearly $1,200 more a month in mortgage payments for an average home.
But for many buyers, strong wage growth over the past two years should help soften the financial pinch, said mortgage analyst Robert McLister, who runs MortgageLogic.news.
“You would find that the total affordability is not as bad as it would seem in some places if you factor in that,” Mr. McLister said.
And lower home prices mean down payments can go further to reduce the size of a mortgage and its monthly instalments.
With borrowing costs still elevated, Mr. Tal expects only a modest revival in housing activity this spring. But the affordability gains realized so far are so little that even small price increases would erase them in the absence of further interest-rate declines, he said.

Full text: MOLLIE V. BURKHOLDER (née Bacon) January 8, 1932 – J anuary 18, 2 024 Mollie Burkholder passed away peacefully, in her home at Hastings Manor, Belleville, Ontario, on January 18, 2024, at the age of 92. Predeceased by her husband, Robert “Bob” Burkholder (2020); her parents, James and Florence (née Bradley) Bacon; and siblings, James (Edna), Dorothy May (Gord), Bill (Bernice), Florence Rowe (Howie), Ron (Helen), Bett Card (Bill), Albert (Helen), Barbara Brown (Al) and Elizabeth Gammack (Martin). Survived by her beloved brother, David (Marlene). Also survived by her children, Rena Burkholder (Cam Portt), R. Jayne Burkholder, James Burkholder (Ann), J.
Bradley Burkholder (Jodi) and Elizabeth Micallef (Robert); grandchildren, Michael Portt (Laura Carlson), Andrea Portt, Jessica Smith (Jack), Russell Drenth (Jessica), Kyle Burkholder, Jesse Drenth (Abbey Smith), Ashley Burkholder, Dylan Micallef (Britany Hernandez) and Hayley Micallef Vinkovic (Ryan); great-grandchildren, Lawrence Portt, Mason and Kellan Smith, Maximus and Elena Drenth, and Haley Drenth; and many nieces and nephews.
Mollie was born and raised on Muriel Avenue in Toronto, the eighth of eleven children, and attended Danforth Technical School. She was a good student, and her best marks were in sewing, a high school subject at the time. She was a very proud member of the badminton team. The Bacon family spent the summers ‘in the country’ in Unionville. Her father, an inside worker at the main post office in Toronto, would drive to Unionville for the weekends. Commuting that far daily was inconceivable at the time. When school ended in June, Mollie and her sister, Elizabeth, would cycle from Toronto to Unionville, so they would have “wheels” for the summer. Mollie was a dark-eyed beauty with long black hair. She met her future husband and love of her life, Bob Burkholder, at a baseball game in Unionville, and they married in 1952. Shortly thereafter, Bob’s parents purchased a bakery in Belleville, and Mollie and Bob moved there to support her parentsin-law in their new business enterprise, “Burkholder’s Bakery.” Mollie learned how to decorate cakes and soon became the decorating expert.
Mollie started a home business as a seamstress, building upon the skills that she learned in high school sewing classes. She sewed costumes for the Quinte Figure Skating Club, working in the corner of the dining room of their modest home. The house bustled on final fitting day when sugar plum fairies, snowflakes and others descended. The business grew, and soon Mollie was creating fashion masterpieces - beautiful, one-of-a-kind bridal gowns based on pictures of sleeves, necklines, etc. that the bridesto-be provided. Ever the frugal manager of fabric, she would often create a negligee from the remnants as a gift to the bride. Somehow, she also found time to sew clothing for their family of five, with special items for birthdays and Christmas. Mollie was a busy, busy woman. She loved fashion and was always turned-out in style. Shortly after Mollie and Bob moved to “R.R.#6,” east of Belleville, Mollie re-entered the workforce. She became a Sears’ employee, first in the fabric department, followed by successive positions as manager of various departments. She loved her time at Sears and the enduring friendships that were forged there. Grandchildren arrived and Mollie was the consummate grandmother, she loved babies and young children. March breaks, Christmas holidays and summer vacations were filled with adventures, wonderful meals and love.
Our family sincerely thanks Dr. MacLeod and the wonderful staff at Hastings Manor for their compassionate and professional care during Mollie’s final months. You sat with her and shared quiet moments when she needed you, and were there when we needed you. We are truly grateful. A celebration of the lives of Mollie and Bob will be held on February 17th from 1-4 p.m. at the Belleville Club, 210 Pinnacle Street, Belleville. There will be a service for Mollie commencing at 1:30 p.m. If so desired, donations in Mollie’s memory may be made to the Heart and Stroke Foundation or your local Humane Society.
Arrangements entrusted to Steele Funeral Home, Belleville, (613) 968-2273.
BOB ARMSTRONG It is with great sadness that we share that our wonderful, dearly loved Bob passed away on January 21, 2024, surrounded by beauty in the Dominican Republic. Cherished husband of Diane McQuaig. Together they enjoyed a marriage filled with tremendous love, laughter and adventure. Adoring father to daughters, Kelly and Erin. He was so proud of them and their many accomplishments in the art and film world. Stepfather to Kate (Dan), Laura (Jodan), Margot and Jacqueline (Charles). Beloved “Bear” to Will, Ben, Hudson, Hunter, Dylan, Tessa, Henry and Elliott. He will be sadly missed by his brother, Brian (Doreen) and family. Bob was happiest surrounded by family and friends at their farm in Creemore. A true Renaissance man, Bob had many talents and interests. He was a successful litigation lawyer who enjoyed a long and illustrious career. He had a rich life outside of work. His passions included music, photography, art, travel and golf. He was also a voracious reader, movie-goer and lover of fine dining. His love of music started as a young boy in Owen Sound, listening to his transistor radio and picking up Motown from Detroit. That burgeoned into a lifetime passion for concerts, musicals, and copious playlists he shared generously.
As he grew older, he fostered a passion for capturing magical moments, and was rarely seen without his camera slung over his shoulder. He was known for his heart of gold, generous spirit, and infectious laugh. His popular newsletter, “bitsandbobs… the world according to Bob,” was something many readers enjoyed weekly. He was one of a kind, and larger than life. We are heartbroken… and will miss him dearly. In lieu of flowers, please consider a donation to Camp Cucumber supporting struggling single mother families, a charity near and dear to his big heart (w w w. c a m p c u c u m b e r . co m) .
Family and friends are welcome to join us on February 4, 2024, from 4:00 - 6:00 p.m. at The Miller Tavern, 3885 Yonge St., to toast his remarkable life.
THE HONOURABLE ED BROA DBENT P. C., C.C.
1936 –2 024 Ed passed away peacefully in Ottawa, Ontario, on January 11, 2024, at the age of 87. He leaves behind his partner, Frances Abele; his two children, Paul and Christine; his four grandchildren, Nicole, Gareth, Caitlin and Brett; his two great-grandchildren, Alice and Freya, and many close relatives and dear friends. Ed was predeceased by his former spouses, Ellen Meiksins Wood (m.
2014-2016) and Lucille Broadbent (m. 1971-2006), he is also survived by ex-wife, Yvonne Yamaoka (m.
1961 div. 1967).
John Edward Broadbent was born in Oshawa, Ontario, on March 21, 1936, to Percy Broadbent, a General Motors worker, and Mary Welsh, a homemaker.
Ed demonstrated an interest in politics and academia at a young age. He earned a degree in philosophy from the University of Toronto, graduating in 1959.
He then pursued postgraduate studies at the London School of Economics and Political Science, before returning to the University of Toronto where he obtained a doctorate in political sciences, graduating in 1966.
Ed was elected to the House of Commons in 1968 as a member of the New Democratic Party of Canada (NDP). He was a Member of Parliament for the riding of Oshawa-Whitby for seven years before becoming leader of the NDP in 1975, a position he held until 1989. He briefly stepped away from politics to serve as president of the International Centre for Human Rights and Democratic Development (Rights and Democracy). He returned to the House of Commons from 2004-2006 when he was elected as a Member of Parliament for Ottawa Centre.
In 2011, Ed founded the Broadbent Institute, remaining active as founder and as member of the Board of Directors while teaching political science at several universities in Canada and abroad.
Throughout his seven-decade career, Ed fought for justice and equality, making great strides in the advancement of the rights of disadvantaged persons.
Ed was a firm believer in the politics of joy: a joyful, meaningful life was one filled with music, movies, barbecues, time outdoors but above all time with family and friends. Those close to him will miss his thoughtful conversations discussing a good book or his recent travels over a glass of red wine.
A state funeral in memory of the Honourable John Edward Broadbent will be held at 4 p.m. on January 28, 2024, at the Carleton Dominion-Chalmers Centre in Ottawa. Canadians are invited to watch the ceremony live on CBC/ Radio-Canada television and web streaming platforms.

Full text: One of the biggest questions going into 2024 is how the B.C. government’s new legislation to significantly boost density will play out, and it’s a question on a lot of minds.
Metro Vancouver presented a staff report to its regional planning committee this month that cited several concerns about the province’s new legislation, which will “result in significant and historic changes to the planning framework for British Columbia.”
Municipalities are now required to allow multiunit homes on single-family lots. The province has also set new height and density minimums around transit hubs. The report was authored by deputy chief administrative officer for policy and planning Heather McNeil and deputy general manager for regional planning and housing development Jonathan Coté. It includes concerns about sidelining carefully crafted local area plans for measured growth in areas that do not yet have transit or the infrastructure to accommodate significant density.
The “blanket approach,” the report says, “could result in a greater density of housing in parts of the region that are more car dependent.”
In other words, the result could be more sprawl. The report also cites the challenge of needing to fast-track upgrades to schools, emergency services and transportation.
Development industry members are also concerned about the blanket requirement for minimum tower heights of up to 20 storeys around rapid transit stations and 12 storeys around bus exchanges, many of which are surrounded by detached houses.
It’s not just a question of height, but floor space ratio, which is the entire floor area allowed in relation to the size of the lot. A Vancouver detached house with basement suite and laneway house typically had an FSR of 0.86, which meant the total floor space could be 86 per cent of the lot size. The new multiplex zoning allows an FSR of 1.0, or a building as big as the lot size. With the new transit-oriented development legislation, a building within 200 metres of a bus loop, for example, can be 12 storeys high with a floor space ratio of 4, or four times the size of the lot. In other words, the buildings are going to be a lot bigger, which could have implications for setbacks and green space. It remains to be seen.
Developer Hani Lammam, executive vice-president of the Cressey Development Group, said he’s seen his own house, a 1905 heritage home near the King Edward SkyTrain station, greatly upzoned. He wonders how that will play out in terms of heritage house protections and the need for new infrastructure and associated costs. As well, the new legislation removes minimum parking requirements. He applauds any policies that add density, but he said it also seems like “all gloves are off,” in terms of pushing density into areas not equipped for it.
“At my house, you have an outright 4 FSR right now. Is that what it is? Because that’s how it reads. I don’t think it’s right. If it is, then fantastic. I won the lottery. But I don’t think that’s going to be the case.
“Let’s talk about this transitoriented development regulation,” Mr. Lammam said. “Guess what, the house that I live in is now 4 FSR and 20 storeys or something … maybe 12? Okay, that’s nonsense, because I don’t think that’s going to be allowed. I just can’t imagine. … What happens to the heritage and character, all that stuff? Do we just throw that out the window? I don’t understand. I think it’s crazy. And what comes with that? Where are the strings, because there will be strings attached, I suspect. We will have to pay for more infrastructure now, water and sewer capacity. And all this is without parking, apparently.
“There are a lot of implications on these neighbourhoods that are supposed to accommodate all this density that are not designed to accommodate this density. So, nobody knows. I think there will be a bit of a stalemate again while we see how these municipalities react to these provincial regulations.
“It’s going to take time, and it could be years in the making. It’s not like overnight we rebuild everything. But it does mean, from a long-range planning perspective, they’ve changed the goalposts,” Mr. Lammam said.
Real estate consultant and commentator Michael Geller is known for offering ideas on housing policies, some of which have been implemented by government. One of his newer ideas is the adoption of a two-tier tax system that puts detached houses in a higher bracket than attached homes, such as condos and duplexes. The idea arose when he realized he was paying the same taxes on his Coal Harbour condo as his west-side house.
Mr. Geller argues that a lower rate for multifamily homes could incentivize the redevelopment of single-family properties into multifamily multiplexes. Vancouver City Council last year also voted to upzone most single-family areas up to six units per lot.
“This idea does make sense, especially since the province wants to encourage the redevelopment of single-family lots with multiple units,” Mr. Geller said. “What better way to reinforce the idea than to increase the taxes on a lot when it is used solely for singlefamily dwellings – albeit with a possible basement suite and/or coach house? And decrease the tax by having a lower mill rate on the same lot if used for three to six dwellings?” He also likes the idea in principle because he sees unfairness as to how a lot of single-family homes are taxed, such as wealthy people who live on agricultural land reserves, taxed as farmland.
“I live in Southlands, and I am surrounded by people who live in $25-million houses and some of them pay less property tax than you do. That’s because they are growing $2,000 worth of vegetables on a portion of their large lots.”
The Ministry of Housing responded to inquiries by e-mail, saying that local councils set property tax rates and B.C. already has nine property classifications. As well, houses are already taxed at higher values and are paying a higher share of tax.
The idea of a two-tiered residential assessment wasn’t being considered, said Housing Minister Ravi Kahlon.
“We will continue taking action to get more homes built faster for people,” he said.
Derek Holloway is a retired BC Assessment appraiser who handled a lot of appeals from property owners. He said the upzoning will have the effect of increasing land values. He cited criticism of the Auckland, New Zealand, single-family house upzoning, which some academics say resulted in price increases and only modest net housing supply gains.
“As soon as you start seeing sales to developers or small contractors who buy a single-family lot on a Kitsilano lot that is 50 by 120 [feet] so they can build four units, they will tear down the old house, build … and move on to the next one. That will drive up the price of the house being sold because it’s taken from a singlefamily house to a development site, and it will drive values up,” said Mr. Holloway, who was with BC Assessment for 30 years.
“You don’t say, ‘Everyone who owns a home in Vancouver can build three to six units.’ You say, ‘Here’s an enclave where we are going to do that, because it’s beside commercial and transit nodes,’ and that stuff. What they did in the old days was upzone to duplex, something like that. And that was a buffer zone between high density and retail and single family. So, they could do that tomorrow. … Upzone small areas, not the whole city.”

Full text: A decade ago, Joe Bladek’s clients typically put down deposits of between $1,000 and $5,000 when making an offer on a new home. Today, the Barrie, Ont.-based mortgage broker said, those deposits are more commonly in the range of $5,000 to $10,000 – and recently, he worked on an offer where the buyer put down a $50,000 deposit and had to ask family for help to scrounge up the funds.
“A lot of clients don’t realize that deposits are quite large these days,” Mr. Bladek said. It’s partly owing to the higher cost of homes themselves, since deposits are typically between 1 to 10 per cent of the sale price. But it’s also a holdover from the pandemic bidding wars, when buyers sought to compete with firm offers. And while deposits come from the down payment, buyers need to have the money on hand.
It’s just one example of how the costs linked to buying and selling a home have crept up over the years, largely because of higher housing prices.
Experts say buyers should typically expect to spend between 1 and 5 per cent of a home’s purchase price on moving and closing costs.
Twenty years ago, if someone were to buy a house at the national average price of $245,149, they would have likely spent between $2,450 and $12,250 to close on their house and to move. At the end of 2023, someone who bought at the national average price of $657,145 would have needed to pay between $6,571 and $32,857 for moving and closing costs.
A statistic used often by the real estate industry, though almost never with a citation, says that Canadians move every seven years on average. If true, a hypothetical buyer who moved three times in the past 20 years could have spent a total of between $15,000 and $62,000, roughly, depending on the value of their homes.
In Toronto, where the average house price was $1.126-million at the end of 2023, moving and closing costs would range from $11,260 to $56,300. Now imagine today’s first-time buyers moving multiple times over a lifetime.
Rona Birenbaum, certified financial planner and the founder of Caring for Clients in Toronto, said moving costs can hurt someone’s financial plan in the short term. While she said they’re often not enough to derail someone’s financial picture, “they don’t give you any kind of return on investment; they are absolute expenses,” she said.
“That money that comes out of the client’s financial picture – if it was in the financial picture, it would be compounding. So you lose the compounding on that money, on that wealth.”
Ms. Birenbaum added that in particular for older Canadians, multiple moves later in life can eat into funds that should be earmarked for necessary living expenses and end-of-life care.
For some buyers at the margin, the costs associated with closing on a home and moving house can change the economics of buying.
“They can be very prohibitive,” said Mr. Bladek. “Some clients of mine who’ve come to me wanted to move into a new home and can qualify for that new home, but with all the fees involved and the market the way that it is … can’t make it at the end of the day.”
There are plenty of costs linked to buying or selling a home in Canada, including land transfer tax (in most provinces), lawyer and realtor fees, title transfer and insurance, deposit money, property appraisal fee, home inspection, a status certificate for condo owners, and of course, movers, among others.
The biggest cost for many buyers is the land transfer tax, said Daniel La Gamba, a real estate lawyer and founding partner of LD Law LLP in Toronto. Ontario, Quebec, British Columbia, Manitoba, Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island have such taxes, and Toronto homeowners pay double the tax of buyers elsewhere in Ontario. Montreal also has its own land transfer tax.
Land transfer taxes are based on property value and often run in the thousands of dollars, though each province takes a slightly different approach. New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island charge a flat rate of 1 per cent of the purchase price or assessment value; Nova Scotia’s is 5 per cent; the other provinces have marginal tax brackets.
While the taxes themselves have remained consistent for years, steadily climbing home prices mean that someone buying today is likely facing a heftier upfront tax bill than they would have in years past.
Mr. La Gamba said that someone buying a million-dollar home in Ontario would pay $16,475, and that amount would increase to $32,950 for someone buying in Toronto.
Sellers also pay the commission for both their agents and the buyer’s, which come to a combined 5 per cent plus sales tax, though Mr. La Gamba noted there is the potential to negotiate.
The cost of moving services themselves also spiked during the pandemic as fuel and labour shortage costs hit local and longhaul movers. According to Statistics Canada, moving company rates increased a whopping 18.9 per cent in the third quarter of 2021, and have continued to post small increases in the years since.

Full text: The National Capital Commission is working with the Ontario Provincial Police to investigate the authenticity of a painting attributed to Norval Morrisseau that had been previously on display at a prominent government building in Ottawa.
The NCC’s decision came to light after The Globe and Mail contacted the department of Global Affairs Canada about concerns from the estate of Mr. Morrisseau, which said it believed the painting had “similar characteristics” to pieces of art discovered during an art fraud investigation by the OPP. The art was on display at Global Affairs headquarters, the Lester B. Pearson building.
Global Affairs said the artwork is not part of an inventory that belongs to the department’s visual arts collection but instead belongs to the NCC.
Valérie Dufour, a senior manager of strategic communications for the NCC, said the Crown corporation, which is dedicated to the capital region, is “collaborating with the authorities to verify the authenticity of the artwork which is no longer displayed.”
Ms. Dufour said Friday the artwork was taken down in May of 2021.
Gosia Puzio, a spokesperson with the OPP, said she can confirm the “OPP is aware and engaged with the NCC in relation to authenticating the artwork” and no further details are available.
Mr. Morrisseau was an acclaimed artist and residential school survivor who experienced sexual and psychological abuses after he was forcibly removed from his community, the Bingwi Neyaashi Anishinaabek First Nation in Northwestern Ontario. Mr. Morrisseau’s work is displayed in prominent buildings and institutions.
Mr. Morrisseau became a member of the Order of Canada in 1978 and was the first Indigenous artist to have a solo show at the National Gallery of Canada.
But Mr. Morrisseau’s legacy has been affected by inauthentic pieces that are now believed by the estate to outnumber the real ones.
Cory Dingle, who is the director of the Norval Morrisseau Estate, said there are estimated to be up to 6,000 fraudulent pieces that could be circulating in the market.
Mr. Dingle said in a statement on Friday that the estate applauds the NCC for their “attention and diligence in seeking legitimacy to the painting that we suspect might be fraudulent.”
“We are willing to assist them in their endeavours,” Mr. Dingle said. “The estate looks forward to hearing the outcome of the investigation and assisting the government in the cleaning up of all fraudulent paintings.”
Jonathan Sommer, a lawyer who regularly represents victims of art fraud, said it would be no surprise if fraudulent pieces of art have made their way in to public institutions or on to the walls of government buildings. He said if the NCC is making efforts to determine the authenticity of the artwork, he applauds the effort.
“This is something that very much has to be done,” he said. “It has to be done to fight art fraud, it has to be done to restore Norval Morrisseau’s legacy and it has to be done in the spirit of truth and reconciliation.”
Prior to his 2007 death, allegations started to emerge about people who were creating and selling art under his name and with his distinct Woodland School of Art style.
Last March, the OPP and the Thunder Bay Police Service arrested eight individuals for their involvement in the apparent fraudulent manufacturing and distribution of artwork purported to be created by Mr. Morrisseau.
The forces said that, as a result of a 2½-year investigation, the eight individuals faced a total of 40 charges and more than 1,000 alleged fraudulent paintings, prints and other artworks had been seized. Some of these paintings sold for tens of thousands of dollars to members of the public who had no reason to believe they weren’t genuine, the forces added.
In December, Thunder Bay resident Gary Lamont was sentenced to five years in prison for his role in defrauding purchasers and the public by inducing them to buy work falsely attributed to Mr. Morrisseau.
“In addition to trading the forgeries to local distributors, Lamont sold the forgeries to various individuals and galleries across Canada, where they were subsequently purchased by unsuspecting members of the public,” an agreed statement of facts said.
The statement also said each piece was sold by Mr. Lamont, on average, for between $2,000 and $10,000.
Mr. Dingle said there are a “vast amount of characteristics” that are similar between the painting that was in the Lester B.
Pearson building and those seized in the OPP investigation.
The estate has great concern about all paintings suspected to be inauthentic, he said, adding it is especially concerned “when that painting is shown in a prominent building on TV with officials in front of it.” Mr. Dingle was referring to a television interview with Liberal cabinet minister François-Philippe Champagne that featured the artwork in December, 2020.
Mr. Sommer runs a company called Morrisseau Art Consulting Inc. with John Zemanovich, who has extensively researched Mr. Morrisseau’s artworks. It investigates and examines work attributed to Mr. Morrisseau.
Mr. Sommer said the piece of art, which was also previously hung in the Senate of Canada, raises some “red flags” for him, such as its visual composition, choice of colours and the way figures are drawn, adding this is inconsistent with many of Mr. Morrisseau’s standard practices.
“They also, at the same time, appear to be consistent with many of the things we’re seeing in the artworks that, for example, Gary Lamont, the fraudster, has admitted to producing in his fraud ring,” Mr. Sommer said.
Mr. Sommer said he highly recommends the piece of art be examined by a credible expert.
Resources must be made available to address issues of art fraud generally, such as a through a unit within the RCMP or the Canadian Intellectual Property Office, that can co-ordinate efforts across the country to stop art fraud, Mr. Sommer said. Mr. Dingle has also called for intervention, such as a federal art division.
Sergeant Kim Chamberland said the RCMP shares a fraud mandate with other police across Canada. “At this time, there is no consideration within the RCMP to create a federal art fraud investigation unit.”

Full text: 11969 Jasper Ave. N.W., No. 3601, Edmonton OLIVER Asking price: $3.45-million (March, 2023) Selling price: $3-million (October, 2023) Taxes: $20,078 (2022) Days on the market: 226 Listing agents: Cathy Cookson, Clare Packer and Judy Clare-Packer, Re/Max Excellence THE ACTION This 2,430-square-foot penthouse sits atop an eightyear-old high-rise perched over a golf course and the North Saskatchewan River. The listing price of $3.45-million was uncommonly high by Edmonton standards and contributed to a long sales process. Still, the property attracted interest from buyers in several other provinces.
“This year, we’ve worked with a lot of buyers from different cities in Ontario, B.C. and even Saskatchewan,” said agent Cathy Cookson. “They’re all coming because they hear how good the value is here and the economy is quite good, so you can get bigger bang for your buck.”
Although there was a scattering of interest from out-of-province buyers in the spring, no solid offers emerged. Finally, a local buyer put forward a bid of $3-million, which was accepted.
No other recent sales in the area came close to that price level, Ms. Cookson said. “In downtown and Oliver, there have been nine sales over $2-million, and the next highest sale was $2.825-million … and another at $2.4-million. That’s pretty uncommon [to have] three sold over $2-million in the same year. And all of them closed in October.” WHAT THEY GOT This two-bedroom suite has four fireplaces, three bathrooms, all with heated floors, and an open kitchen with custom cabinetry, Gaggenau appliances and a granite-topped island.
There are three entertaining areas inside and five more outdoors. The largest one is a 1,500square-foot terrace with a kitchen, hot tub and fire table.
The unit includes a four-car garage. Monthly fees of $2,133 cover heating, water, 24-hour concierge and use of the recreational facilities.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “When you walk in, it’s truly breathtaking, and the view you can’t get anywhere else.
It’s literally 360 degrees of the city,” Ms. Cookson said.
“And you don’t get that kind of [terrace] space in most places.
You could be sitting in the hot tub and enjoying the views.”

Full text: PITCHING IN The organizers: Ted Markle and Jamie Massie The pitch: Raising $300,000 and climbing The cause: the Simcoe Muskoka Regional Cancer Centre As the country was emerging from the worst of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021, Ted Markle and his friend Jamie Massie started talking about doing something in their area to bring people back together.
Mr. Massie owns Braestone Farm, a real estate development outside Barrie, Ont., that includes a farm, skating pond and other outdoor amenities. “He and I were walking around the farm and we were talking about organizing a community event.
And as we rounded the pond, we kind of agreed on a pond hockey tournament. What could be more small-town Canada than that?,” Mr. Markle recalled from his home in Oro-Medonte, outside Barrie.
Mr. Markle had just lost his brother Jeff who died in the summer of 2021 from an aggressive form of cancer that affected his esophagus, stomach and liver.
Mr. Markle, 57, was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma several years ago and he’s been successfully treated at the Simcoe Muskoka Regional Cancer Centre.
“It only made sense that our regional cancer centre should be the beneficiary of such an event,” he added.
The first Braestone Winter Classic Charity Pond Hockey Tournament took place in 2022 and featured 16 teams of men and women who competed in a three-on-three format. Twenty teams participated the following year and the tournament raised $175,000 over both years for the hospital.
This year’s classic takes place from Feb. 2-4 and 22 teams are expected to take part. Mr. Markle is hoping to raise $130,000.
He joked that so far the event has come during the coldest weekend of the winter. But that hasn’t stopped players and spectators from showing up. “We’re just so fortunate. Everybody is happy to get involved, to roll up their sleeves, to volunteer or to play,” he said.
Seeing the tournament grow has been gratifying for him, but he’s especially proud of how the community has rallied around the event. “And being a little bit competitive by nature every year you want to raise a bit more,” he added.

Full text: 35 Church St., No. 703, Toronto S T. LAWRENCE MARKET Asking price: $1,495,000 (November, 2023) Previous asking price: $1,495,000 (September, 2023) Selling price: $1,460,000 (November, 2023) Previous selling price: $300,000 (March, 1994) Taxes: $5,363 (2023) Property days on market: 68 Listing agent: Christopher Bibby, Re/Max Hallmark Bibby Group Realty THE ACTION In a roughly 40-yearold condo building at Church and Front streets, this 1,723-squarefoot corner suite has a prime spot on the seventh floor overlooking the iconic Gooderham Building, also known as the Flatiron Building.
The owners failed to find a buyer in their first few weeks on the market, so they tried a common strategy; cancel the listing and relist immediately at the same asking price, a move that puts the property back at the top of the list of online property search results. About a week later, they landed a deal $35,000 short of their list price.
“What made this unit very distinct is it was in the southwest corner of the building, so in the solarium and on the south side and west side of this unit, you had a completely unobstructed and protected view of the Flatiron Building/Gooderham Building,” agent Christopher Bibby said.
“If we were unsuccessful, we’d have that spring market to target.
But the fact there was no competition and there was nothing quite like this listed for some time, we had some optimism.” WHAT THEY GOT This two-bedroom suite has windows in every room other than the eat-in kitchen and the two bathrooms. A solarium is accessible from one bedroom and the living room.
The unit includes a storage locker and parking. A monthly fee of $1,563 covers water, cable, concierge and use of common amenities, such as the indoor pool and squash/racquet court.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “Everybody coming in just loved the fact the bedrooms were separated, and it had a proper solarium, dining room, living room and enclosed kitchen,” Mr. Bibby said. “So it really felt like a home.”
“A lot of [interested] buyers in there love to get out, walk and take advantage of the local amenities, be it Berczy Park or be it St.
Lawrence Market. And you have quick access to the harbourfront, Financial District and Entertainment District.”

Full text: T he battle for affordable housing in B.C. will only grow more challenging in the year ahead.
Exacerbating the problem is that rents continue to climb while household incomes stagnate, according to new data that also reveal the rise of homelessness by 33 per cent since 2022.
In response to the crisis, the provincial government passed a suite of new housing policies that promise to reduce housing costs through the upzoning of singlefamily and transit areas, but some experts question if it will achieve results.
Metro Vancouver released its Housing Data Book for 2023 and it shows a sizable gap between new and vacant units and occupied units. The gap will continue to devastate low-income groups.
According to the Data Book, the average rent for a newly built apartment in 2022 in Metro Vancouver was $2,409 a month – 44.4per-cent higher than the average rent for an existing occupied unit of any age.
The unit doesn’t have to be new to undergo a hefty rent hike.
It just has to be empty. A newly built one-bedroom unit averaged $2,053 a month, while a vacant unit averaged $2,008 a month. An occupied one-bedroom unit averaged $1,539.
The pattern was the same for bachelor and two and three-bedroom units.
About 50 per cent of renter households can afford to pay, at most, $1,663 a month in the city of Vancouver, says Simon Fraser University’s City Program director Andy Yan. Only 30 per cent of renter households can afford rents that are $3,125 a month or higher. He used data from the Data Book for his findings.
The total median household income of a renter was $67,000 in 2020; however, that would have been temporarily affected by the Canada Emergency Response Benefit payments at the onset of the pandemic, he says.
“The report provides a pretty sobering reality check for the province as they unroll their new housing legislation, in terms of whom they can build for, and what people can actually afford,” Prof. Yan says.
For seniors who’ve been living for decades in the same apartment, an eviction is devastating because of the new market rates and the competition to find a new place, BC Seniors Advocate Isobel Mackenzie says.
“And then it becomes much more compelling for the landlord to get them out. … The stakes are even higher for the landlord: ‘If I can get $200 more, I might not bother, but now I can get $2,000 more and so it’s worth a little effort to figure this out.’ That is also coming into play.”
About 30 per cent of seniors in B.C. are on the guaranteed income supplement. That means they have an income below $26,000 a year, with no way to increase their income. Ms. Mackenzie has been arguing for a longoverdue increase in the Shelter Aid subsidy for elderly renters, which, she says, is doable and a far quicker fix than waiting for social housing to get built.
To address all this, at the end of 2023, the province passed broadsweeping legislation aimed at incentivizing greater density around transit hubs, which are traditionally areas most needed by low-income renters. Prof. Yan found that about half of the residents in these areas are already renters and one in three renters in the region live in these transit areas. They will now face new levels of rental instability.
New provincial housing policy means municipalities must allow 20-storey minimum heights within 200 metres of a SkyTrain station and eight-to-12-storey buildings within 800 metres. Bus exchanges will have minimum heights of eight and 12 storeys.
Another major change is mandating multiplex developments in all single-family zones throughout B.C.
After BC Green MLA Adam Olsen had called for release of the report on which the legislation had been based, the 200-page commissioned report was finally released in December.
The report offers estimates and predictions that could follow these radical reforms to B.C.’s single-family zones and transit areas, largely based on similar policies enacted in Auckland, New Zealand.
Several authors of the report are well known for their pro-development stance, and so too was a list of experts who’d helped advise on some of the legislation.
The report was prepared by data analyst Jens von Bergmann, an outspoken member of the controversial group Abundant Housing, University of B.C. real estate finance professors Tom Davidoff and Tsur Somerville, and sociology professor Nathanael Lauster, author of The Death and Life of the Single-Family House, who launched a lawsuit to repeal the B.C. tax on foreign buyers, suggesting it was discriminatory.
Another author is Terra Housing’s Albert Huang, also listed as a member of Abundant Housing.
The group is Vancouver’s answer to San Francisco’s YIMBY movement, which believes strongly that the way out of the housing crisis is to build as many multifamily homes as possible as quickly as possible, no matter the price point. On social media, members of the group have aggressively confronted those who question the reliance on market-driven redevelopment to solve the crisis, and who worry about the displacement of existing residents, loss of affordable rental apartments, mountain views and heritage housing.
Their stance also puts them at odds with those concerned that the financialization of housing is driving up prices, or that there is such a thing as too many towers.
The province gave Mr. von Bergmann and his associates nearly half a million dollars in funding, according to the Vancouver Sun’s Vaughn Palmer.
They estimate 44,000 to 54,000 net new completions of housing units over five years, because of the new policies, which “would result in six to 12 per cent lower prices and rents than what they would have been without the provincial legislation.”
That does not necessarily mean housing affordability, says retired planner Ken Cameron, who played a central role in the region’s adoption of the Livable Region Strategic Plan of 1996. He also worked for the city of New Westminster, B.C., and the Ontario government, as well as chief executive officer for the Homeowner Protection Office. Mr. Cameron says dramatic action needs to be taken to address the housing crisis.
“I would just like to be more confident that somebody has looked at how this will work and assured themselves that it will produce the amount and kind and cost of housing that we are looking for,” Mr. Cameron says.
“It was my generation of planners that was there when these problems were created, and there is no doubt that housing is a crisis, and we need to resolve it.
“I compare it to the introduction of the Agricultural Land Reserve (ALR) in 1973. … A very bold and sweeping intervention on the part of the provincial government, which also set aside local zoning provisions and a lot of local planning work that had been done.”
However, the ALR might have protected farmland, but it didn’t always protect farming. For example, in the tony west side neighbourhood of Southlands in Vancouver, ALR land has been purchased by non-farmers to build massive single-family homes.
“Just changing what can be built in the technical zoning sense doesn’t necessarily mean that it will be productive and actual housing will be built,” Mr. Cameron says.
“These transit-oriented developments are not new developments. They are older parts of the community in which they sit.
There is, for example, a fair amount of low-rise rental accommodation in a number of these places, like Steveston. Or some still left in Metrotown, which will be put on the chopping block for redevelopment by these changes in zoning.
“I think that those of us who’ve been involved in planning in the last 30 years or so have to respect the fact that we have a significant problem, and planning provisions are part of the problem, so something needs to be done. But whether what’s been proposed will actually produce what is needed is really the $64,000 question.”

Full text: 48 Rosedale Rd., Toronto ROSEDALE Asking price: $12.75-million (October, 2023) Selling price: $11.5-million (November, 2023) Taxes: $41,822 (2022) Days on the market: 10 Listing agents: Nigel Denham and Penny Brown, Sotheby’s International Realty Canada THE ACTION This three-storey Georgian was built in 1922 as the home of Alex Gooderham, a member of the family that founded Canada’s largest 19th-century distillery, Gooderham and Worts. Priced at $12.75-million, the owners, uninterested in a drawn-out selling process, accepted an offer of $11.5million from one of the first five visitors to the house.
Agent Nigel Denham said the sellers didn’t want the sale to “drag on into a multimonth process with price changes and whatnot.
“We figured we’d get a local buyer, likely already living in Rosedale, like a move-up buyer coming from a lovely house in its own right, but looking for a real trophy property and trophy address, like 48 Rosedale Rd.”
The deal closed Dec. 20.
WHAT THEY GOT The heritage-designated home sits at the foot of a circular driveway on a 73- by 135foot lot. The structure was extensively renovated in the 1990s with all new mechanical workings and a restoration of the red brick façade.
The interior was also expanded and now has 6,346 square feet of living space, including four bedrooms, seven bathrooms, a butler’s pantry and a great room with 20-foot beamed ceilings.
Fireplaces with mantels from Paris anchor the sunroom, living and dining rooms, one of two dens and one bedroom. There is a sauna in the basement.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “It was built for Alex Gooderham, one of the Gooderham family members and one of Toronto’s original, great families who built the city we know today on the heels of their liquor empire,” said Mr. Denham.
“When our clients did the renos, they hired true artisans, master craftsmen, master carpenters and millworkers for all the mouldings, medallions and intricate details,” Mr. Denham said.
“It’s a classic Georgian people tend to love because they’re timeless and stately, and in this instance, its A-rating [heritage status] added value.
“People just don’t build houses like that any more.”

New rules target use of ‘exclusive’ real estate listings: CREA’s ‘co-operation policy’ criticized as an attack on the free market

Full text: THE LISTING This year, Canadians will see the effective end of the socalled “exclusive” real estate listing amid a crackdown on the sales tactic by the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA).
But some realtors are asking whether it truly is the end of the exclusive, or just the opening salvo in a bigger fight over organized real estate.
“CREA is being protective for no valid reason,” said real estate lawyer and registered realtor Mark Morris with Legalclosing.ca Professional Corporation. “They are over-stepping their bounds in a significant way. … What we’re doing now is limiting what they [sellers and buyers] can do in the free market.”
At issue is a method of selling a home that has become more common in recent years. These “exclusive” listings, sometimes also called “pocket” or “off-market” listings, are properties put up for sale but not entered on the Multiple Listings Service. Local real estate boards rely on the MLS to share both broker-only information among members and to publish public data on the realtor.ca national website.
On Wednesday, the new “cooperation policy” formulated by CREA came into effect, forcing any realtor to add an exclusive listing to the MLS within three days of doing any public marketing. Marketing would include everything from a “Coming Soon” sign on a lawn to Instagram posts about a new property.
The vast majority of residential real estate transactions in Canada involve MLS, but there are significant exceptions. Most commercial properties are not listed for sale on MLS, and large chunks of the market for trading in preconstruction contracts for condominium apartments are not found on MLS either. The recent proliferation of websites providing sold-price data, sourced from MLS, has driven more sellers and buyers to attempt to keep their transactions private through the use of exclusive listings.
“Ninety-nine per cent of the time things are happening on MLS, but [exclusives] have always been around,” said Andre Kutyan, broker with Harvey Kalles Real Estate Ltd. The type of client he often sees wanting to go exclusive is a celebrity or business leader, but in recent years he’s seen more agents claiming to do more exclusive deals, too. Verifying those claims can be difficult when there’s no record of a transaction. “There’s a lot of agents who say. ‘Most of my deals are exclusive.’ They try to create the perception they are doing a lot off the books, but there’s no way to tell.”
There are private groups on messenger services on Whatsapp and Signal with hundreds of agents looking to flog or buy an off-market home, and there are even web services that have formed a sort of alternative to the existing MLS to provide a platform for these exclusives.
In 2021, entrepreneur and former realtor Eric Skicki created his own marketplace for non-MLS real estate called BrokerPocket and says he now has 7,000 users of his service (which is not accessible to the general public). Right now, there are about 700 listings on his site, a mix of preconstruction condos and residential real estate listings.
“We’ve become the most successful non-organized real estate platform that doesn’t belong to an association,” said Mr. Skicki.
He said the CREA policy, “has significant challenges and should be reconsidered,” and that he hears from his members that many are not happy with the new rule. For now, BrokerPocket will allow users to post exclusive listings if they affirm they are not a members of a board.
Adam Weiner, a salesperson with Harvey Kalles Real Estate Ltd., does a lot of “exclusive” advertising on his social media channels and says that while he’s still able to sell a home off-market the rule will cause him to market it differently.
“I think what I’ll do I’ll mention we have stuff in the pipeline, but I’m not going to be specific, because we aren’t allowed to,” he said.
It’s not clear yet how boards will enforce the new rule.
“Toronto Regional Real Estate Board (TRREB) Members adhere to CREA’s realtor code, and the new co-operation policy is a part of the realtor code,” said Paul Baron, TRREB president, in a statement.
“A process is also in place to ensure TRREB member realtors adhere to the related policies, including all forms of public marketing that don’t meet the CREA exceptions.”
Mr. Morris warns that some boards may be draconian in attempting to enforce the new rule, which could further undermine support for organized real estate.
“What is actually going on here is that MLS and the boards have been terrible at addressing people’s actual needs; they’ve not provided for a system that allows for exclusive listings and not provided for a system for assignments,” he said. “Co-operation is a choice and the seller should have that choice.”

Wimbledon in battle with locals over expansion: Hundreds of people who live near the tennis club question the economic benefits of its plan to build 39 more courts

Full text: Wimbledon is usually associated with strawberries and cream, pristine grass and some of the best tennis matches in history. But another high-stakes drama is playing out off the court over a controversial plan to nearly double the size of the historic venue.
Battle lines have been drawn between the private club that’s been home to The Championships for more than 140 years and a group of local residents who oppose plans to build 39 courts on a 29-hectare golf course the club owns. If approved, the project would take about seven years to complete and boost the total number of courts to 80.
The All England Lawn Tennis Club argues that its $340-million expansion, which includes a new 8,000-seat stadium, is critical to keeping pace with the other Grand Slams in New York, Paris and Melbourne. The extra courts will allow the AELTC to hold the Wimbledon qualifying tournament, which currently takes place at a tennis centre it leases in nearby Roehampton. The club also says the development will help local businesses around Wimbledon and generate as many as 300 more full-time and seasonal jobs.
The project has faced stiff opposition from hundreds of people who live near the Wimbledon complex, which is nestled in an affluent suburb in southwest London. They argue the project will ruin the area’s natural heritage and they point out that the golf course is inside the city’s greenbelt, which restricts development. Many residents also question the economic benefits and say the only real winners will be the AELTC’s 375 members.
“It’s just not right,” said Penny Terndrup, who lives a few blocks from the club and is part of the Save Wimbledon Park group. “It’s not right because this has got nothing to do with tennis, really.”
Ms. Terndrup is a retired lawyer who loves tennis and regularly attends Wimbledon. But in her eyes the expansion is too much.
“This area will change completely,” she said as she walked through Wimbledon Park, a public park that runs alongside the golf course. “The nature of this community will change.”
She rejected the charge made by some at the AELTC that the residents are just “NIMBYs” opposed to any progress in their backyards. “I think NIMBY applies to sharing a bit more,” she said. “It’s not about making, frankly, some really quite rich people richer.”
Campaigning by both sides has been intense.
The AELTC has flooded homes throughout the neighbourhood with brochures and organized information walks to extol the project’s benefits. “Our proposals will deliver one of the greatest sporting transformations for London since 2012, alongside substantial benefits for the local community,” said AELTC’s chief executive Sally Bolton, referring to the 2012 Olympics.
Save Wimbledon Park has held rallies against the plan and won the backing of the area’s two MPs, one Labour and one Conservative. It also has the support of a dozen residents’ associations and the local chapter of the environmental organization Friends of the Earth. An online petition to stop the expansion has generated more than 16,000 signatures.
Getting approval for the development is a complicated process.
The proposal straddles two local authorities – Merton and Wandsworth – and the councils have come to opposite conclusions about whether it can go ahead.
Merton’s planning committee voted six to four in October to approve the expansion but last month Wandsworth’s sevenmember committee voted unanimously against it. “We could not support the loss of green open space at Wimbledon Park and the loss of mature trees that was at the heart of this application,” said lead councillor Simon Hogg.
The proposal now heads to the Greater London Authority, or GLA, for its decision and it could end up on the desk of Michael Gove, the cabinet minister responsible for local government.
The key hurdle the AELTC must overcome is the greenbelt restriction.
The golf course, which the club fully acquired in 2018, is no longer in use and it sits across the street from the AELTC complex.
It’s part of the wider Wimbledon Park green space, which was created in the 1700s. The entire area has been designated Metropolitan Open Land, which means that any development can only be permitted under “very special circumstances.”
The AELTC argues that its plan meets that test. The project includes a park area and walking trails, which will be accessible to the public, as well as improvements to Wimbledon Park’s small lake. The club says that while 291 trees will be removed during construction, it will plant 1,500 more.
It will also make seven of the 39 courts available for community use and reserve tickets to 500 seats in the new Parkland Show Court for residents of Merton and Wandsworth to purchase during the tournament.
The club has some community backing. Wandsworth council received close to 300 statements of support for the development.
“Bringing the qualifying tournament into the area has the potential to financially benefit the local retail outlets, restaurants and cafés,” wrote Sarah Watts, who has lived in the community for more than 35 years. Another resident, Sir John Wheeler, wrote that the AELTC and Wimbledon generate huge tax revenue for the country. “It is fundamentally right that it should be able to develop its property for the benefit of its business plan and the wider public interest,” he wrote.
But those comments were dwarfed by the nearly 2,000 submissions against the project.
“It feels sad that a world-renowned tournament that is fondly regarded by the British public and local residents has the potential to become a juggernaut that is threatening to cause environmental destruction in the name of sport,” wrote Frances Jones.
Andy Young said the application was “against all logic and stated health measures that a civilized society is expected to comply with.”
Christopher Coombe, a member of the Save Wimbledon Park group, said the AELTC should brace for a long fight. The all-volunteer organization has drawn from a wealth of talent in the community. Mr. Coombe spent 40 years as a lawyer specializing in real-estate projects and the group includes several other experienced lawyers as well as landscape architects, environmental consultants, communications specialists and architects. “We’ve got all the skill sets,” he said with a smile.
The group is open to compromise. Mr. Coombe said Save Wimbledon Park might support a smaller-scale project with about half as many courts. The group also wants guaranteed public access to the new park and walking trails “so that this is not the slippery slope for further development.”
The AELTC hasn’t budged and so the battle rages on, much like a classic Wimbledon tennis match.
“Of the five sets without a tie break, we’ve had one each,” Mr. Coombe said, referring to the two council decisions. By his reckoning the GLA is the third set, Mr. Gove the fourth. And the fifth? “I think it ends up in the courts.”

Full text: At one of Mexico’s newest all-inclusive resorts, you won’t find any bland buffets, crowded pool bars or fire dancers. The property’s restaurant offers a menu-less dining experience, in which every dish (enjoyed whenever and wherever you want) is tailored to your tastes. Even the wristband has gotten an upgrade: Here it’s a wooden beaded bracelet that doubles as an electronic key to your tented suite.
The adults-only, Naviva, a Four Seasons Resort in Punta Mita, which opened last year with 15 safari-style tents on 19.5 hectares, is one of many new all-inclusive properties refreshing the model.
While packaged vacations have been around since the 1950s, when Club Med first introduced the concept in Spain, the appetite for them has surged in recent years. Hospitality companies are building to meet demand, but this time, it’s luxury travellers driving the new wave of properties – which means the conventional offerings aren’t going to cut it.
“Rather than a traditional resort experience, our all-encompassing stays evoke the feeling of staying at a friend’s home,” says Eduardo Sampere, Naviva’s resort manager. Rates start at US$3,950 a night and include food and alcohol, daily activities, wellness classes, one spa treatment per guest and “unscripted experiences” such as impromptu wine tastings or surprise stargazing sessions.
From January to March, 2023, the demand for luxury all-inclusives in North America increased by nearly 20 per cent in comparison with the same quarter in 2019, according to data from CoStar, a global provider of real estate data, analytics and news.
Jordana Manchester, a B.C.based luxury travel adviser with Tripzter Travel, began noticing the shift last year. “I’ve never sold so many packages in my 21 years in the industry,” she says. “My clients with families are seeking a relaxing, uncomplicated vacation, but with enough options to keep their busy kids occupied. My adventure clients who aren’t quite ready to travel further afield after the pandemic have realized all-inclusives can be customized and offer upscale offerings, and there is still plenty of adventure to be had off-resort. They just get the benefit of unpacking once and having a home base for the week.”
Unsurprisingly, independent and big-name hospitality brands alike are responding. Hyatt became the world’s largest operator of all-inclusives with the acquisition of the Apple Leisure Group in 2021. By the end of this year, it will have more than 120 resorts in its Inclusive Collection.
Marriott, which had just seven all-inclusive resorts at the beginning of 2021, has since more than quadrupled its portfolio of such properties in the Caribbean and Latin American regions. The hotel giant will continue to lean into the category with more openings, including the first Marriottbranded all-inclusive resort in Cancun and a W-branded adultsonly all-inclusive resort in the Dominican Republic.
“I call this new generation of travellers the ‘subscription generation,’ ” says Brian King, president of Marriott International’s Caribbean and Latin America region. ”They have grown accustomed to the payment and fulfilment ease of Amazon Prime, Netflix and premade meals from Hello Fresh, so all-inclusive follows that model. These guests want no surprise bill at the end.”
Even with inflation, affluent travellers are willing to pay extra for ease, convenience and unique experiences.
Virtuoso, which has a few hundred all-inclusive hotels within its luxury network, reported that year-to-date sales have surpassed those of 2022 for the same January to June time frame by 37 per cent, and 56 per cent over 2019.
While loyalty programs drive bookings with larger brands, specialty experiences draw travellers to boutique resorts, says Cory Hagopian, Virtuoso’s senior vicepresident of sales and partnerships.
As resorts move away from cookie-cutter experiences, many are now differentiating themselves by being family-focused or adult-focused (and also offering activities and amenities that cater to solo travellers). In the process, they’re addressing some of the previous flaws with the all-inclusive model.
ENHANCED CULINARY OFFERINGS Today’s most in-demand properties offer Michelin-level dishes with local ingredients and options for almost every dietary preference.
“Sending a guest with celiac disease or a dairy allergy always felt like a gamble, but not now,” Manchester says.
At Jade Mountain Resort, an adults-only luxury property in St.
Lucia, about 70 per cent of guests choose the all-inclusive meal plan. In addition to a culinary program developed by chef Allen Susser, winner of a James Beard Award, the resort’s regenerative farm anchors its menu offerings.
Other hotels, such as TRS Ibiza Hotel, the first adults-only all-inclusive hotel in Ibiza, Spain, have partnered with top-rated local restaurants to allow guests to use their dining perks off-property.
Minibars are also seeing an overhaul, with properties such as the Caves Hotel in Negril, Jamaica, stocking theirs with snacks and beverages from the area.
MULTIGENERATION VACATIONS Travel agents have also seen an uptick in large families booking all-inclusives that cater to varying interests, mobility levels and ages. Club Med is one of the major players improving its multigenerational offerings. Earlier this year, it announced its refreshed brand identity, L’Esprit Libre (the Free Spirit), which aligns with its new Exclusive Collection portfolio of five-star resorts, villas, chalets and even a yacht. Its Canadian ski resort, Club Med Québec-Charlevoix, is among its top-end properties that attract skiing families by including lift passes, lessons and child care in the room rates.
IMMERSIVE WELLNESS Spa treatments, once considered pricey add-ons, are now often included in many packages. Some properties, including Miraval Arizona Resort and Spa – which offers more than 100 classes and activities – have taken the approach one step further by operating as all-inclusive wellness retreats.
Others, such as Clayoquot Wilderness Lodge on Vancouver Island, have found success with nature-based wellness experiences that invite mindfulness (think a glacial plunge in the Bedwell River or a heart-pumping canyoning adventure that tests travellers’ nerves and agility).
Aerial, BVI, a luxury all-inclusive private island resort founded by philanthropist Britnie Turner in the British Virgin Islands, has launched a program geared toward helping veterans recover from physical, mental and emotional stress. On the menu is red light therapy, acupuncture and equine therapy on a ranch with rescued horses.
CULTURAL EXPERIENCES Similarly, resorts are putting more thought into their cultural programming and off-site adventures. “These newly minted resort-goers have stalked the Serengeti or hiked the Inca Trail, but they’ve never strolled the streets of Santa Domingo or had a cooking lesson in Tulum because they think of these excursions as allinclusive adjacent, and therefore, not ‘real travel’ experiences,” Manchester says in Vancouver.
As travellers’ tastes evolve, allinclusives are increasingly exploring creative ways of partnering with local businesses.
“There is a new set of consumer priorities around connection, wellness and authenticity,” Virtuoso’s Hagopian says. “Postpandemic, guests are looking for more – culture, food, convenience and service – and are willing to pay extra.”

A glimpse into a moneyed past: Historic bank buildings are being repurposed for other uses, but those that remain offer a chance to step into the history of Canada’s financial industry

Full text: On Tuesday, Sept. 30, 1873, readers of The Globe (not yet merged with The Mail) who turned over the paper’s front page and scanned to the bottom of the second might have noticed a small memo: The Bank of British North America had moved to its new premises at the corner of Yonge and Wellington streets in Toronto.
The new building at 49 Yonge St. housed a grand marble banking hall on the bottom floor and comfortable living space for the bank manager on top. Its three-storey facade of gold-coloured sandstone would have stood out against the city’s ubiquitous red brick.
The bank building still stands, a vestige of Toronto’s early banking era and an architectural landmark near the base of Yonge Street.
Now, for the first time in 11/2 centuries, the banking hall could once again have residents living over it.
The City of Toronto is currently considering a proposal to perch a 60-storey tower on top of the former bank, adding 256 residential units in an area where density is in high demand.
If accepted, the building’s renovation will fit into a long tradition of repurposing surviving bank buildings, a trend that is intensifying as architects consider the pressing need for housing, the environmental benefits of reusing building materials, and heritage preservation requirements.
The current proposal involves conserving most of the bank exterior and salvaging parts of the original banking hall, though the details of the zoning changes will be debated before the Ontario Land Tribunal in the spring of 2024.
With their ornamental designs, double-height banking halls and attractive corner-lot placements, historic bank buildings have remained popular locations for adaptive reuse projects, said David Pontarini, architect and cofounder of Hariri Pontarini Architects. “As Toronto has matured and become a global, high-risefocused city, we’ve had to deal with the pressure of inserting new densities into these complex sites,” Mr. Pontarini said.
His firm was part of the team behind Massey Tower, a residential skyscraper on Yonge Street completed in 2019 that used part of a 1905 Canadian Bank of Commerce branch as its lobby. A similar condo project has been proposed to sit atop the 1958 Bank of Canada building at Queen Street and University Avenue.
Across the city, dozens of other former bank branches are living second lives as hotels, cafés, retail space and modern offices.
The 1917 Bank of Montreal building at 302 Bay St. is being redeveloped as a co-working space, and the 1930 Dominion Bank branch at Yonge and Gerrard streets, recognized for its art-deco ornamentation, is awaiting a new retail tenant, having most recently held a cannabis store.
These remaining historic bank buildings provide a peek into the history of Canada’s financial industry, and illuminate Toronto’s evolution into Canada’s largest urban centre.
The oldest remaining purpose-built bank building in Canada is nestled behind a pair of trees a few blocks east of a busy stretch of Yonge Street, at the northeast corner of Adelaide and George streets.
When it was built in 1827, the resemblance of the Bank of Upper Canada to the houses of Toronto’s wealthy elite who made up the bank’s board of directors would have been clear to the local business community.
Today, the building holds offices for Orium, a software company. In its basement, the bank’s vault, with three-foot-thick brick walls, still forms part of the building’s foundation.
As Toronto evolved during the 1840s and 50s, the city’s architects began to explore Italian-inspired styles derived from British models. Banks that resembled private members’ clubs in England became particularly popular, and the new Renaissance architecture reflected the city’s growing mercantile and industrial success in the lead-up to the U.S. Civil War.
But for some Torontonians, the deviation from the staid Georgian style was too much. On Oct. 28, 1861, The Globe ran an unsigned letter to the editor opining on the design of a nowdemolished Ontario Bank in the city’s financial district. The two Venetian-inspired carved faces, placed on either side of the front door, constituted a “criminal eyesore,” the reader said. “If not too late, something ought to be done in alteration.”
The Bank of British North America building at 49 Yonge St.
was constructed at the start of a wave of Second Empire design craze in Toronto. Imported from France and the United States, the architectural style was a modern reflection of the entrepreneurial ambition sweeping the city after Confederation.
Toronto’s population swelled in the second half of the 19th century, as did the administrative and white-collar ranks. The sudden demand for office space in the core made real estate prices jump, and banks held on to prime locations and supplemented their income by offering space to rent in their upper storeys.
This is the case with the 1908 Birkbeck Savings and Investment Co. building at 10 Adelaide St. E., which offered several storeys of office space above its banking hall. Some of that space is still rented out today, while the rear administrative offices are now used by the Ontario Heritage Trust, a non-profit government agency.
But economic trouble was sweeping the Canadian financial system. During the 1910s and 20s, the banking industry underwent a period of intense consolidation, with dozens of mergers taking place and leaving just a handful of dominant large institutions, including BMO, Bank of Nova Scotia, Canadian Bank of Commerce and Royal Bank of Canada.
The early 20th century therefore became a period of rebuilding of bank headquarters, as they strove to keep up with the rapid growth of their staff and a long list of new administrative functions. This coincided with the period of early skyscrapers, which began to rise on both sides of Yonge Street.
Perhaps the most celebrated at the time was the Dominion Bank’s 12-storey headquarters at the southwest corner of Yonge and King streets, at that point the most prestigious intersection in the city’s financial core. The new bank, completed in 1914, took up a whole city block, then unprecedented for a single bank building.
The centrepiece was the bank’s double-height banking hall and sweeping entry space.
Today, the bank is part hotel and part residence, with its banking hall and vault – at the time the largest in Canada – used for events and weddings.
Reactions to the new tall buildings were mixed. Canadian bankers enjoyed the comparisons to New York that the buildings elicited, but health professionals worried about the office density and shadows they cast.
The skyscraper “freaks,” Toronto’s Dr. Charles Hodgetts said in a 1912 edition of the early 20th-century journal Construction, would “damn most fair Canadian cities.”
Banks also offered services through local branches, most often built in a style known as Edwardian Classicism. Between 1900 and 1920, the number of branches across the country leapt from 1,000 to 5,000, according to a feature on banking in the 1948 edition of The Canadian Encyclopedia.
Most of these branches were used for banking until the 1960s and 70s, when they came to be seen as at odds with the idea of a modern Toronto, said David Winterton, a bank building history expert and senior associate at ERA Architects.
“A lot of them got torn down and turned into modern branches, or were sold off,” he said. “But there was also a countermovement of people saying, ‘We can occupy these buildings. We don’t need to tear everything down.’” As a result, many of these banks, often local landmarks, have been transformed into pubs, cafés and stores – a transformation that continues to this day.
When Ava Janikowski, the owner of design firm Chase Architecture, was looking for a new office, a former BMO branch in suburban Etobicoke caught her eye. The building’s historic brick, symmetrical façade and lofty proportions drew her in, and the firm quickly began reinstating a historic-styled portico and removing the drop ceiling.
As bank buildings in Canadian financial districts are increasingly being demolished and replaced with modern offices, and as Canadians turn to online services instead of branches to carry out business, the bank buildings that remain offer a glimpse of the city’s financial and architectural past, she said.
“It’s definitely more expensive to maintain because of the high ceilings, so more volume of air to cool or heat. But the rewards are phenomenal,” Ms. Janikowski said. “People don’t perceive why, but when they enter an old bank, they just feel good.”

Full text: From the moment police arrived at the smouldering crime scene on Dec. 1, they could tell that the Nissan X-Trail had been pushed down the overgrown jungle road while still on fire.
There was a terrible story written in the trail of melted plastic and blackened car parts that littered the route.
At the top of a hill, high in the volcanic mountains overlooking the fishing village of Soufrière on the southern tip of the Caribbean island nation of Dominica, scorched grass and plastic marked a likely ignition point. The culprit, or culprits, had tried to push the Nissan to the left, down a steep cliff where it would have been concealed from passersby. But the debris trail suggested the car had instead veered right, where it hung up on the road’s shoulder.
With the vehicle fully engulfed, they had somehow coaxed it back onto the road, and directed it down an embankment, where it lodged against a cluster of trees. It remained there overnight and into the next morning, in plain view of a group of villagers walking to work around dawn.
They alerted police, who found the incinerated remains of two people inside.
The victims were later identified as Daniel Langlois and Dominique Marchand, a pair of wealthy Canadians who were beloved throughout Dominica for having invested heavily in an array of local projects.
They were burned beyond recognition.
As Joeffrey James, Dominica’s assistant superintendent of police, considered the crime scene that morning, he concluded that the person, or people, responsible for such a clumsy operation would have been seriously burned. He also noticed signs that an accelerant had been used to set fire to valuable forensic evidence, which he said was an indication that this wasn’t a local job.
“To me, it looked to be a crime of passion, of deep-seated hatred,” Mr. James said at police headquarters, from behind a desk littered with manila case files, a copy of Barack Obama’s presidential memoir and a Bible open to the Book of Psalms. “It was a highly unusual scene in such a peaceful country. And it has saddened the entire nation to see people so respected meet their demise this way.”
Later on the same day the wreck was discovered, Dominican police arrested three people, including Jonathan Lehrer, an American landowner and cocoa farmer who was much less beloved by locals, and who had been involved in a bizarre, multiyear property dispute with Mr. Langlois over a stretch of island roadway. Their battle had spilled over into the island’s courts, and a final ruling was imminent.
The deaths and arrest shocked this country of 72,000 people, a mountainous island roughly the size of Calgary. Even in the bustling capital of Roseau, everyone greets one another on the streets, native and newcomer alike. It’s a place where secrets aren’t kept for long, especially when they tell a story about monied foreigners and a government-sanctioned investment scheme for doomsday preppers.
Mr. Langlois and Ms. Marchand first laid eyes on Soufrière in 1997.
Three years earlier, Mr. Langlois had sold Softimage, his pioneering 3D animation company, renowned for work on movies such as Jurassic Park and Titanic, to Microsoft for $130-million. He remained heavily involved with the company, but was looking for a change of scenery and life direction.
He was consumed with the idea of building a self-sustaining luxury resort in a tropical locale. It would be built with local materials, powered by wind and solar energy, and fed by rainwater. He referred to it as a research project, not a resort – one that would prove that opulence could exist without environmental compromise.
Mr. Langlois had scouted other locations, but the couple felt as though they would be remiss if they skipped the island with which Ms. Marchand shared a name. Soufrière, at the south end of Dominica, soon laid a spell on them, as it does many visitors.
They dived among coral reefs with a charming divemaster named Simon Walsh, paddled among turtle nesting grounds and hiked to Petit Coulibri, an untouched ridge of land facing south toward Martinique.
Dominica felt removed from the tourism hustle and bustle of surrounding islands, and the villagers were among the friendliest people they’d encountered anywhere. Mr. Langlois bought 285 acres on the majestic ridge they had hiked. “The land started to talk to me and tell me what it should be,” he would later say in a promotional video.
The whole project had the farout feeling of Isla Nublar, the fictional island in Jurassic Park. Petit Coulibri was only 3.3 kilometres from Soufrière, but the steep access road leading to it seemed like a passage to another world. It wound through thick rainforest, past the ruins of a defunct colonial plantation called Bois Cotlette and out onto sun-kissed volcanic cliffs.
Mr. Langlois brought to the construction process the same exacting eye that had served him well animating dinosaurs and doomed ocean-liners. He studied the way the light struck Petit Coulibri at all hours of the day to calculate optimum solar-panel angles. He designed buildings, water schematics and electrical systems, drawing on his computer engineering skills.
While his dream came together, he quietly sponsored countless community businesses and activities, including Caribana festivities.
On Sept. 18, 2017, the event that would forever endear Mr. Langlois to locals came sweeping in from the southeast. Hurricane Maria stripped the roofs off 90 per cent of the island’s homes, knocked out electricity for months and made Dominica’s many mountain roads impassable.
“It’s hard for anyone to imagine how devastating Maria was,” said Mr. Walsh, the divemaster, who owns Nature Island Dive on the Soufrière waterfront. “It came at sunset, and by the time the sun rose the next day there were no leaves on the trees, no green, everything was either collapsed or deforested.”
Like many locals, Mr. Walsh was left homeless, without food or water. Also like many locals, he soon heard directly from Mr. Langlois.
“He asked what I was going to do, whether I was going to stay in Dominica,” Mr. Walsh said. “And said he wanted to start something called Resilient Dominica to help the community immediately and make it more resilient so we’re not so badly off in the future.”
His diving business temporarily destroyed, Mr. Walsh signed on as project manager. They started small, with a school lunch program, and moved into supplying solar-powered lights so kids could study at night. Then they tackled a bigger goal: rebuilding the Soufrière Primary School.
Mr. Langlois brought the same fastidiousness he relied upon at his resort property, which he had named Coulibri Ridge. He picked paint colours in accordance with where the sun hit at certain times of day (he gave the teachers final say) and insisted on expensive concrete roof panels.
“He said we’re not using plywood because it’s not resilient.
We’re using the stuff we use on skyscrapers in Montreal,” Mr. Walsh said.
Former U.S. president Bill Clinton toured the final product, and World Central Kitchen, founded by celebrity chef José Andrés, partnered with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s charitable foundation to build a commercial kitchen in the school capable of feeding thousands of people in the event of another natural disaster.
Resilient Dominica, shortened to RZDM, built a jetty in the neighbouring village of Scotts Head to allow for disaster evacuations, protected turtle nesting grounds and, more recently, helped stave off stony coral tissue loss disease, a coral-killing malady related to rising sea temperatures. For her part, Ms. Marchand threw her energy and funds into establishing the Dominica Humane Society.
For all its enchantments, Dominica has its share of frustrations.
Washed out roads go years without repair. The electrical grid is temperamental. The pro-democracy non-profit Freedom House has voiced concerns about the country’s election management and judicial efficiency, and about alleged corruption in its government.
Mr. Langlois initially planned to finish Coulibri Ridge within five years. But he was basing his timeline on construction projects he had overseen in Montreal. Island crews worked at a more leisurely pace, and the island government never seemed completely onside.
By the time Maria hit, he had spent close to 20 years on the project. In 2018, he hired a Canadian construction manager, Neil Suter, to oversee the finishing of work on the resort.
The long-time contractor had been teaching construction at a London, Ont., college. He and his wife had long planned to retire in Dominica. The job was an opportunity to accelerate that timeline.
As much as Mr. Suter liked the couple behind Coulibri Ridge, and the resort’s blissful surroundings, there was one thing about the job that bothered him from the start.
In 2011, Mr. Lehrer, who is originally from New Jersey, had bought Bois Cotlette, the defunct plantation located along the public road leading to Coulibri Ridge.
He and his family had painstakingly reclaimed the plantation from the jungle and established a chocolate and cocoa farm that
drew tourists eager for a glimpse at the region’s colonial past.
That was all fine by Mr. Suter.
What irritated him was Mr. Lehrer’s attitude toward anyone who drove or walked the road leading through Bois Cotlette, called Morne Rouge Public Road. It was the only route to Coulibri Ridge.
In a sworn statement taken as part of an eventual lawsuit brought by Mr. Langlois against Mr. Lehrer, the Canadian construction manager said Mr. Lehrer and his wife, Victoria, had repeatedly stopped vehicles travelling on the road. On one occasion, Mr. Lehrer had halted a container truck travelling ahead of Mr. Suter on its way to Coulibri Ridge. When Mr. Suter stepped out of his vehicle to check on the situation, Mr. Lehrer “started to shout at me and told me not to speak to him on his property although I was on the public road,” Mr. Suter told the court. “He was very aggressive to me and took my phone away.”
Local police were able to get the phone returned. A video of the encounter was played in court. In four years of working at Coulibri, Mr. Suter said, he had made four such police reports. But police rarely offered assistance.
The Bois Cotlette owners accosted locals as well. Mr. Suter filmed one instance of Ms. Lehrer yelling at a Soufrière resident walking along the road. She accused the man of poisoning her dogs.
It’s unclear from court documents how Mr. Lehrer defended his efforts to obstruct the road. A court decision mentions that he had sought to make a counterclaim of negligence and nuisance against Mr. Langlois. Container trucks supplying Coulibri Ridge had to drive perilously close to some Bois Cotlette historical ruins as they navigated the disputed road, but Mr. Suter told The Globe and Mail he saw no evidence that the traffic had damaged the structures.
On Oct. 18, 2018, Mr. Lehrer escalated the dispute “by placing boulders across the road, digging a trench across the said road, erecting metal pipes and placing equipment and supplies on the road,” according to a court ruling.
Mr. Suter told The Globe that the public works department eventually showed up to clear the road, but didn’t bring any machinery. Mr. Suter ended up moving the boulders with a piece of construction equipment owned by Coulibri Ridge, he said.
After the blockade, Mr. Langlois applied for a court injunction against any further obstructions and sued Mr. Lehrer for interfering with his economic interests.
The injunction was granted in 2018 and extended in a 2019 decision by the Eastern Caribbean Supreme Court, which noted Mr. Lehrer had proposed a bypass that would have routed vehicles around the ruins on the Bois Cotlette property. But the court decision says Mr. Lehrer had denied entry to engineers sent to assess the viability of the bypass.
A trial was held in May, and a decision in the case is imminent.
By 2021, Mr. Suter said, the continual struggle of driving to Coulibri Ridge from Soufrière had started to wear on him.
Mr. Lehrer’s business model did little to ease his anxieties. The Bois Cotlette website invites investment from “preppers” looking for an escape from “economic or political turmoil, a prolonged natural disaster, or another possible scenario.”
“Bois Cotlette defines preparedness,” it says, “and is the best hedge against crisis in our complex world.”
Bois Cotlette had been approved as a real estate project under Dominica’s Citizenship By Investment program. The government-run scheme grants Dominican citizenship to applicants who invest at least US$200,000 in approved real estate projects in the country. Revenue from this accounts for up to 30 per cent of the country’s GDP, according to the International Monetary Fund.
Only 10 or so projects have government approval at any one time, granting them special status.
It’s unclear how successful Mr. Lehrer was at soliciting investments. Bois Cotlette no longer appears as an approved project on the government’s Citizenship by Investment website, but it was listed as recently as October, according to web pages saved by the Internet Archive. The 2022 annual report for Mr. Lehrer’s business, which is registered in Puerto Rico, reports a total business volume of less than $3,000,000, but provides few other details.
Mr. Suter left Coulibri Ridge in December, 2021.
“I did not want to work for Daniel any more because of having to travel that road,” he said.
Last month, Kerry Alleyne, one of the operators of Soufrière Outdoor Center, took Mr. Langlois and Ms. Marchand for a kayak trip to a secluded beach near Pointe Guignard, a popular diving area and turtle nesting site.
Mr. Alleyne had been close with the couple since he was a boy. But their November sojourn was the happiest he’d seen them.
“They just treated me like any other friend,” he said. “We were racing and playing the whole way.”
They were different than other wealthy foreigners who came to town, he said. They always supported local businesses, among them some of Mr. Alleyne’s ventures.
By late this year, the couple had every reason to be happy. Mr. Langlois was 66 years old, and Ms. Marchand was 58. Coulibri Ridge had officially opened to rave reviews, including one from The Globe.
On Nov. 30, a Thursday, Mr. Langlois and Ms. Marchand drove to Soufrière to buy meals from their favourite local cook.
They left her kitchen in the late afternoon and drove their Nissan up the twisty Morne Rouge.
Somewhere around the entrance to Bois Cotlette, the couple were shot, police say. Investigators would later find a single bullet hole in the Nissan’s trunk.
On the evening of Dec. 1, officers rolled onto the Bois Cotlette estate, and took Mr. Lehrer and his wife into custody, along with a visitor named Robert Snyder. A self-proclaimed mechanic from St. Petersburg, Fla., Mr. Snyder had arrived on Nov. 15 and was scheduled to leave the island Dec. 6.
When police took Mr. Snyder into custody, they noticed severe burns on his arm and leg. Mr. Lehrer and Mr. Snyder were later charged with murder. They have yet to enter a plea. Their lawyer did not respond to a request for comment. Ms. Lehrer was released without charge.
A few days later, a court ordered investigators from Dominica’s Customs and Excise Division to transport Mr. Lehrer from his cell to Bois Cotlette for a search of the property. The move enraged locals, who claimed he was receiving preferential treatment because of his government connections. The lead homicide investigator, Mr. James, said Mr. Lehrer was brought to Bois Cotlette as part of an investigation unrelated to the alleged murders. Mr. James would not discuss the substance of this other investigation.
Video from the search later circulated on social media. It shows a vast network of underground tunnels housing several shipping containers.
Although the murder charges have not been tested in court, many residents of the island believe the dispute between Mr. Lehrer and Mr. Langlois is what led to the deaths, and they are now angry that government authorities didn’t intervene earlier.
“We let it be handled in the courts,” Mr. Alleyne said. “That’s why the village is so upset now. We should have dealt with it ourselves.”
Islanders said they had little faith in the ability of Dominica’s police to put together a solid case.
Some said they feared government interference.
Dominican Prime Minister Rosevelt Skerrit announced Tuesday that the government would be appointing a special prosecutor to handle the case.
In Soufrière, it was often Mr. Langlois and Ms. Marchand, and not government officials, who stepped in with money and expertise.
Now, several projects are in limbo. Mr. Langlois had wanted to build an eco-friendly marina in Scotts Head. Phase two of the successful coral rehabilitation program, led by Mr. Walsh, was still in the proposal phase. And the Dominica Humane Society has lost its chief funder.
The couple invested in resilience, a quality the village will need as it moves forward without its main benefactors. “We won’t let them down,” Mr. Alleyne said.
“They had confidence in us. Now we have to have that same confidence in ourselves.”

Full text: The Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan prides itself on investing in sustainable companies. So, in planning to move its head office to a new building in downtown Toronto, it’s placing emphasis on the environmental impact and sustainability of its own office furnishings and materials.
“A lot of the furnishings in the building we’ve been in since the 1990s are at their end of life.
Moving to the new building gives us a clean slate,” says George Konidis, OTPP’s managing director and global head of real estate operations and workplace transformation. The pension plan has made public commitments to be net zero by 2050 and since 2019 has already decreased its portfolio emissions intensity by 32 per cent and absolute emissions by 3 per cent.
The new offices that accommodate roughly 1,650 employees are moving from an older building at Yonge Street and Finch Avenue to fill about a third of 160 Front St. W. “This is a new building designed with sustainability in mind and it is a better marriage with what we stand for as an organization. We have an opportunity to select the right materials and equipment to provide for the well-being of our employees,” Mr. Konidis says.
Desks, chairs, fabrics and flooring being purchased for the move in the spring are all being vetted for environmental impact and sustainability before purchase. Criteria include use of recycled materials and recyclability, sustainable local manufacture and even the kind of packaging they will be delivered in, Mr. Konidis says.
Suppliers are offering more ecologically friendly furnishings and cleaner manufacturing technologies than were available in the past, he says. “For instance, the task chairs we’ve selected will contain over 40 per cent recycled material and 50 per cent readily recycled parts. There are a lot of fabric selections that contain significant amounts of recycled materials.”
There is a growing trend of tenants prioritizing office environment, and they could consider moving if landlords don’t work with them to help meet their sustainability goals, concludes a new study on the future of real estate by Deloitte Canada.
It surveyed 100 major Canadian commercial real estate owners and tenant companies and found only 26 per cent of office landlords have a decarbonization strategy and emission-reduction goals for 2030, while just 34 per cent said they use sustainable materials.
Meanwhile, nearly half of the tenants surveyed from a diverse range of industries said they might seek early lease termination if landlords fail to meet their own decarbonization and net-zero goals.
“Landlords of buildings that are updating their investment in sustainability, for example in common areas and building envelopes that create sustainable office environments, can be seen to have a more perceived value in this market,” says Marco Macagnano, digital real estate leader at Deloitte in Toronto. “Tenants are more likely to want to move into offices if their buildings are net-zero carbon aligned.”
These days it’s important for landlords to structure incentives and shared costs to provide green benefits and customization for tenants, otherwise many of them may begin to think about lease renegotiation, he adds.
“Many companies have set 2030 as a target for carbon-neutral and that’s right around the corner,” he says. “Many current properties and offices are below modern standards of green building performance and materiality while a program of upgrades can take years to complete, so there’s really a small window to begin making improvements.”
Calculating the return on investment from building modernization and retrofits is something landlords are struggling with at the moment, Mr. Macagnano says. However, “landlords are increasingly aware of the risk [that] not acting has on longerterm asset value and market attractiveness.”
To help building owners and tenants assess environmental effects of construction materials, Gensler (the global architecture firm that is designing OTPP’s new office) is launching a material performance system it calls GPS – the Gensler Product Sustainability Standards, version 1.0.
The standard includes 12 categories of construction materials, including carpet tiles, ceiling tiles, insulation, partitions, metal framing and paint. It quantifies the effect of embodied carbon on interior air quality, emissions and the lifespans of materials.
“This is a clear framework that we’ve launched publicly that gives our client partners and the construction industry notice that we will be targeting levels of performance,” says Philip GalwayWitham, Gensler’s northeast region resilience and sustainability leader.
“For each portion of the industry there are different levels of requirements with enough nuance that we can encourage the industry to supply more carbon-neutral materials,” he says. “We are asking suppliers to provide thirdparty environmental product declarations of what has gone into the production, in terms of energy, carbon and recyclability.”
GPS also asks providers for documentation of volatile organic compounds that could be offgassed from their materials.
While the standard is voluntary, jurisdictions around the world are setting embodied carbon standards.
“Broadly speaking, the market today still only has a minimum level of certification,” Mr. Galway-Witham says. “Our goal is to start a discussion within the design firms, material suppliers and the construction industry to encourage the industry to improve compliance.
“These are not standards we are making up,” he adds. “Many of them are out there already, but we hope to make them centre stage and keep moving the needle. We are hearing feedback from contractors that say, thank you for having the foresight to lay this all out.”

First Nations, developer to revive Winnipeg: Southern Chiefs sign multiyear agreement with True North to rebuild aspects of downtown core

Full text: An organization representing 34 First Nations in southern Manitoba has signed a multiyear agreement with a prominent real estate developer that has the potential to revive Winnipeg’s struggling downtown core.
True North Real Estate Development, an arm of the company that owns the Winnipeg Jets, is planning to work with the Southern Chiefs’ Organization on rebuilding two key properties in the city: the beleaguered Portage Place mall and a shuttered, sixstorey Hudson’s Bay store.
The revitalization would provide a much-needed boost for an otherwise dwindling local economy, according to the federal, provincial and municipal governments. “Winnipeg’s downtown is Manitoba’s downtown,” Premier Wab Kinew told reporters at the project’s announcement on Tuesday.
“People from across our great province come here for a night out to watch a hockey game, to see a concert, to grab a bite to eat. This is where deals are going to be made. This is where clients and investors are going to be hosted,” Mr. Kinew said. “The investments that we make into downtown will pay dividends in terms of future economic activity.”
If the redevelopment proceeds as planned, Portage Place will be demolished to have a residential tower installed on one side of the building and a medical tower on the other. Nearly half of the residential space would be dedicated to affordable housing. The middle section of what is currently a mall would be converted into community centres, offices and retail or food services.
Across the street, the former Bay building that was gifted last year to the Southern Chiefs’ Organization – now named Wehwehneh Bahgahkinahgohn, meaning “It Is Visible” in the Anishinaabemowin language – will become a mixed-use property. It will have hundreds of affordable units for elders and university students. There will also be a museum, an art gallery, a health centre, at least two restaurants and a memorial for residential school victims and survivors.
“This is what true economic reconciliation looks like,” said Grand Chief Jerry Daniels.
“Together, we’ll work to make downtown Winnipeg a vibrant, livable, workable and safe place.”
Last week, True North received approval on a six-month extension before it decides whether to purchase Portage Place. The company said it needed to perform more due diligence on the mall, which is currently owned by the Vancouverbased Peterson Group.
In an interview Tuesday, True North president Jim Ludlow said the company’s plans are “just short of a full go-ahead.” He said while the agreement with the Chiefs’ Organization is “not legally binding, it is binding in principle.”
“Our goal is to get there,” Mr. Ludlow said. “There are a lot of partners that have to move forward at the same time: design, construction, the bank, one level of government, the next level of government. We just have to allow that same amount of time for everybody to stay in that same lockstep.”
As downtown Winnipeg grapples with rising poverty, vacant storefronts and other social issues, Portage Place and the Bay building are powerful symbols of decline.
Kate Kehler, executive director of the Social Planning Council of Winnipeg, said the mall had performed a vital community service. “We need to have places where people can gather,” she said, citing Portage Place and the city’s Millennium Library as about the only places downtown where locals can pass time without having to spend money.
Ms. Kehler said that although True North has made positive noise for its proposals, it remains to be seen how their plans will meet the needs of some of the poorest people across the country.
In a previous interview this summer, when asked about True North’s burgeoning presence in Winnipeg, Mr. Ludlow said the company thought about this a lot. Choosing his words carefully, and acknowledging that this sentiment could come across oddly, he said: “If not us, who?” There isn’t a long list of other suitors. Even as True North increases its downtown holdings, Winnipeg has found it difficult to attract other investors.
Earlier this year, the city’s mayor, Scott Gillingham, said perceptions about downtown safety were weighing on Jets attendance and ticket sales for the local arts sector.
On Tuesday, he called the new project a “game-changer” for the city to move in a more positive direction.
David Thomson, who sits on the board of True North Sports + Entertainment and is a partner for True North through his realestate firm Osmington Inc., was also present at Tuesday’s announcement. The Thomson family’s holding company, Woodbridge Co. Ltd., owns The Globe and Mail.
Initially planned to cost $130million, the Bay building’s redevelopment is now slated to cost around $200-million. The price on the Portage Place plan has also increased to $650-million from $550-million, according to True North and the Chiefs’ Organization.
By mid-2024, True North expects to sign another agreement on multifamily ownership and other investments at the properties, which have a combined footprint of nearly two million square feet.

Retrofits, conversions needed for sustainable future: experts: Creative thinking around construction to play a vital role in problem-solving in the real estate sector

Full text: From greenhouse gas emissions to labour productivity and economic growth, many of Canada’s most pressing problems could be addressed through infrastructure already in place, stakeholders say.
What’s missing, said panelists at a recent summit in Ottawa, held by the Canadian Urban Institute (CUI), is the collaboration between stakeholders and all levels of government required to make it happen.
“Unless we start with action on the ground, right now, we’re going to miss all the targets we’ve pledged towards sustainability and climate change,” said Ursula Eicker, professor of building, civil and environmental engineering at Concordia University and holder of the Canada Excellence Research Chair in Smart, Sustainable and Resilient Communities and Cities.
Prof. Eicker was also among numerous contributors to CUI’s first State of Canada’s Cities report, in which she wrote: “The vast majority of the buildings we will need by 2050 are already built. The challenge is that they need to be converted to efficient, zero-emission standards while maintaining the comfort and safety of people facing emerging climate change disasters like flooding, fire, sea-level rise, drought and heat waves.
“We need an approach to construction that transforms lowperforming buildings into lowcarbon buildings without disrupting their use.”
Along with developers and financiers, architects, engineers, academic researchers, city officials and policy makers all hold an integral role in changing business models and adopting a new way forward. Prof. Eicker pointed out that the structural features of real estate have not significantly innovated in almost half a century, while current regulations and incentives do not support transformative retrofits.
Meanwhile, skyrocketing interest rates paired with higher construction costs are affecting affordability and putting new projects at risk.
“Land is complicated. Building on it is complicated, and so is getting approval,” said panelist Stéphan Déry, president and chief executive officer of Canada Lands Company. “It takes anywhere from four to seven years to dispose of a federal asset. Then you have to get a concept plan approved by the city that could take up to six years, and then you need time for rezoning and permitting.”
Mr. Déry said they currently hold more than 1,000 acres of development land across the country, in addition to now-empty downtown office buildings as tenants have shifted to remote and hybrid work. “So how can we work with governments to ease the conversion of some of these buildings? That’s where I think the collaboration is so important, not just in ways of thinking, but also the desire to move fast, especially in the middle of the crisis that we live in,” he said.
“Because we’ll never get over it if we don’t move faster right now.”
In addition to the affordable housing crisis, Canada is currently facing “huge” economic challenges, said Scott Stirrett, founder and CEO of Venture for Canada. “Our labour productivity has declined in 12 out of the last 13 quarters, while OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) is predicting Canada will be the lowest-performing advanced economy in the next four decades,” he said.
To expand the economy in ways that will enhance labour productivity, Mr. Stirrett said investing in cities is essential to attract companies offering highpaying, quality jobs. “This will ultimately enhance all our prosperity. If we have cities that folks do not want to live in, that are unaffordable, with declining quality of life and crumbling transportation systems, this impedes our ability to develop the kind of knowledge economy that will sustain Canada’s future,” he said.
The future is also dependent on the capacity of towns and cities to adapt constantly to citizens’ ever-changing needs, said CharlesAlbert Ramsay, economics instructor at Dawson College and Kiuna Institution, a First Nations college in Odanak, Que.
He urged city stakeholders to identify, catalogue and publicize their stock of old, underused and adaptive buildings. “Ensure that community groups, businesses or government agencies that need space and could act as an anchor tenant are engaged as a means of financing the renovations needed to get the space going,” he wrote in State of Canada’s Cities.
Mr. Ramsay also called for the conversion of legacy industrial buildings to affordable maker spaces, where small and mediumsized businesses can supply goods and services at manageable prices – from making furniture for homes to welding fences for local schools.
Reusing old buildings for new business is not a new idea, Mr. Ramsay pointed out. “The old Nortel building in Montreal, now called Nordelec, is home to hundreds of small businesses, including a television production company, an advertising firm and an engineering consultancy.
“Policies and legal changes that support these approaches will ensure that as our cities age, they will continue to actively contribute to our collective well-being,” he added.
Creativity will also play a vital role in problem-solving in the real estate sector, said panelist Ana Bailão, head of affordable housing and public affairs for development company and major Canadian office landlord Dream Unlimited Corp.
Dream is the first real estate company in Canada to receive funds from the Canada Infrastructure Bank (CIB) as part of the Commercial Building Retrofits Initiative.
The CIB’s $136.6-million investment will fund Dream’s decarbonization initiative in 19 building retrofits across Ontario and Saskatchewan, with a long-term net-zero goal by 2035.
“We need to look at how we can leverage each other’s participation in this ecosystem,” Ms. Bailão said. “These are the innovative solutions we need to tackle the challenges of the day, the climate changes and the affordability issues we’re all dealing with.”

Full text: Creditors of insolvent newspaper chain Metroland Media Group Ltd. voted to approve a proposal on Monday that would see the company pay pennies on the dollar to restructure its debt and avoid bankruptcy.
Metroland filed for creditor protection on Sept. 15 with liabilities totalling more than $78-million. The publisher laid off 605 employees, nearly two-thirds of its work force, without paying severance or termination pay, while other employees who took voluntary buyout packages earlier this year had their salary continuance payments cut off.
The company, which is owned by Nordstar Capital LP, operated more than 70 community news outlets, but has since shut down all of its weekly print publications and now only maintains regional websites. It still publishes six daily newspapers, including The Hamilton Spectator. Metroland also said in September that it would shut down its flyer distribution business.
A restructuring proposal such as the one filed by Metroland allows a troubled company to address its debt and avoid a bankruptcy filing. Had creditors voted against Metroland’s proposal, the company would have been deemed bankrupt under the Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act.
Trustee Grant Thornton LLP previously endorsed Metroland’s proposal, which still requires court approval, saying that a bankruptcy would likely result in no material recoveries for creditors.
“There are still remaining steps that must take place prior to implementation, but we are hopeful that Metroland will soon emerge from these proceedings into the next chapter of the business, allowing it to continue providing crucial journalism to communities across Ontario,” said Bob Hepburn, a spokesperson for Metroland.
“The union is extremely disappointed that our members will only recoup a fraction of what they are owed in severance,” said Carleen Finch, president of Unifor Local 87-M, which represents Metroland workers.
Andrew Hatnay, a partner with Koskie Minsky LLP, which represents terminated non-union employees, said the proposal is the “best overall result” for those who have been laid off.
The amount to be paid to creditors is not finalized. Metroland intends to apply to the federal government’s Wage Earner Protection Program, which offers payment to former employees stemming from a bankruptcy or receivership. If WEPP is approved, former employees will receive 17 cents on the dollar for the balance of their claims, in addition to other payments. Other unsecured creditors would receive the same repayment percentage.
If the application is turned down, former employees and other creditors will receive five cents on the dollar for the balance.
Lawyers for Metroland scheduled a court date to seek WEPP in late November, but the Department of Justice indicated it would oppose the motion. Metroland is still an operating company, and not in bankruptcy. The company then arranged to have a receiver appointed over its inventory, which could aid in its WEPP application.
“We believe that the likelihood of WEPP being eligible for this company is likely enhanced by virtue of that receivership,” Grant Thornton partner Jonathan Krieger said at the creditor meeting on Monday.
Metroland’s largest creditor is Toronto Star publisher Torstar, which is also owned by Nordstar.
Documents filed when Metroland made its proposal show the company owes $41.6-million to Torstar and $16-million to terminated employees. Torstar, as an affiliate of Metroland, did not vote on the proposal Monday and did not make a claim on its debt.
Unifor is challenging a debt payment the company made during a contentious split between Metroland’s former joint owners.
Jordan Bitove and Paul Rivett formed Nordstar to purchase Torstar in 2020 for $60-million. To fund the deal, the pair borrowed $55-million from Canso Investment Counsel, a Richmond Hill, Ont.-based fund.
Mr. Bitove and Mr. Rivett fell out over the direction of the company and agreed to an arbitration process last year to split up Nordstar’s assets, with Mr. Bitove eventually assuming full ownership of the Toronto Star and Metroland.
During the negotiations, the arbitrator ordered Metroland to sell its sole real estate asset to repay Canso. The proceeds of the sale amounted to $27-million, according to the trustee’s report.
A law firm representing Unifor filed a notice of motion in court seeking an order allowing it to pursue recovery of those funds.
The motion, dated Dec. 10, claims that Metroland was not a party to the Canso debt and “had no legal obligation to make any payments.”
Metroland cited the challenging economic environment for newspapers – particularly the steep decline in print advertising revenue – for its financial troubles. The company’s papers have faced a “sizable loss of readership” and revenue has fallen more than 10 per cent each year for the past three years, according to Grant Thornton, while costs have remained constant.
“Metroland was losing money, and although we’ve been working furiously to find a solution, we hit a point where we simply couldn’t pay our expenses,” Torstar chief executive officer Neil Oliver said at a creditor meeting held in November. “While Metroland is not out of the woods with the proposal, we believe it gives the remaining team and properties the opportunity to be viable for the long term.”

Full text: Over the past half century, Windsor, Ont., has been a consistent bellwether for trouble in Canada’s economy. “First in, last out” is the recessionary refrain sometimes heard here. It’s a reputation that was painfully reinforced during the mid-2000s when the manufacturing hub began to shrink two years before the Great Recession pulled Canada under. Windsor didn’t claw its way back until 2011, well after the broader economy had fully recovered.
Now, once again, the spectre of recession haunts Canada. But this time there are hopeful signs Windsor will be able to flip the script. Even though the city still bears the scars of recessions past, it’s undergoing major reconstructive surgery, courtesy of an unprecedented wave of investment that’s visible everywhere you look.
There’s the $5-billion NextStar Energy electricvehicle battery plant, a joint venture between Stellantis NV and LG Energy Solution Ltd. that will employ 2,500 people full-time when it begins operations. For now, its scores of steel support columns sprout from former farmland on the edge of the city.
The two spans of the towering Gordie Howe International Bridge – an alternative to the congested Ambassador Bridge a couple of kilometres up the Detroit River – will join some time next year. Add to that a planned megahospital, road upgrades, and a flurry of other industrial and residential projects.
A conservative back-of-napkin tally for all that activity shows more than $16-billion will flow into the region over just the next few years – most of it into the city of Windsor itself, a compact area roughly 147 square kilometres in size that’s home to about 230,000 people. That works out to an astonishing $110-million per square kilometre.
No other part of the country is experiencing such concentrated megaspending in such a tight time frame.
Economists believe the explosion of economic activity in and around the city will buttress it against the unfolding nationwide slowdown. The Conference Board of Canada said this week it expects Windsor’s economy to grow 2.4 per cent this year and then grow at an average annual compound rate of 2.9 per cent from 2024 to 2027, giving it the strongest growth outlook of Canada’s 24 largest cities.
Yet that growth comes with strains and has sparked debate over how to accommodate the influx of new residents; how to revive a downtown plagued by drug use, homelessness and vacant buildings; and how to ensure the region can take full advantage of its windfall of government and private-sector investment to escape the cycle of booms and busts that has defined the city’s past.
To capture the full sweep of what’s going on in Windsor, The Globe and Mail met with people from across the economic spectrum: small business owners, housing advocates, property developers, union leadership, corporate executives in the manufacturing sector, entrepreneurs and newcomers.
As their stories show, the opportunities and challenges Windsor faces make this one of the most critical moments in the city’s history.
Reordering the manufacturing landscape Diane Reko, the chief executive officer of Reko International Group Inc., has watched Windsor’s automotive sector deliver waves of prosperity followed by crushing drought time and again. Reko is an automation and machining company started by her father, Steve, in the 1970s that today employs 200 people.
Though Reko doesn’t disclose the industry breakdown of its business, Ms. Reko said automotive companies are its biggest customers. “Automotive is a very cyclical industry where the ups and downs are pretty violently opposed to each other.”
The auto sector and related industries have always dominated Windsor’s economy, but that dominance has waned. Stellantis (formerly Chrysler) is still the largest employer, but the Caesars Windsor casino downtown now holds the No. 2 spot, while General Motors Co. pulled the last remnants of its operations out of Windsor after the Great Recession.
And so, in the years before the COVID-19 pandemic, with memories of the last automotive downturn still fresh, Ms. Reko launched a diversification push at the company’s plants in the Windsor suburb of Lakeshore. In addition to designing, engineering and installing automation equipment for automotive factories, it expanded into everything from the automated handling of brownies and tomatoes to consumer goods and aerospace parts. “It gives us more stability both for our revenues and for the lives of our employees,” she said.
Now a new shakeup is under way, brought on by the EV transition. It’s just not year clear how much of that new business existing Windsor manufacturers will get.
NextStar has said it expects 15 suppliers will follow it into Windsor to create a battery hub. At least two South Korea EV supply chain companies have already announced plans to open shop in Windsor, and last month the city rezoned a large swath of land near its airport for industrial use in anticipation of more.
“I’m not naive enough to think that they’re going to come here and not bring some of their existing supply base,” said Ms. Reko, noting an executive with a battery company warned her South Korean firms have a three-year head start over her company. “It will take time and supporting some of that business before we can also be considered a competitive supplier.”
With the NextStar battery plant and Stellantis investing $1.89-billion in its Windsor assembly plant to ramp up EV production, there’s a “rising market perception about Windsor’s role in this space for the next 10 to 15 years,” said Flavio Volpe, president of the Automotive Parts Manufacturers’ Association (APMA). That, it’s hoped, should draw even more EV companies.
Large Canadian parts suppliers such as Magna International Inc., Martinrea International Inc. and Linamar Corp. are already well-positioned to win EV business, he said, while smaller manufacturers that focus exclusively on the relic parts of gasolinefuelled vehicles will have to change.
To that end, one of Ms. Reko’s customers works in the fuel tank business, but it is developing a new electric product to bring to market. “They’re a longtime customer and we’re pivoting together,” she said.
Meanwhile, as part of its diversification push, Reko is in talks with a critical minerals company about
developing automation tools for that sector, to ensure that Canada can actually provide the raw materials needed for all those EV batteries.
Many analysts have questioned the billions in incentives and production subsidies the Ontario and federal governments have rolled out to lure foreign companies to the EV sector. Ms. Reko understands the frustration “when there are questions about the payback to the economy.” But said she is also a realist. “I get the calls from other jurisdictions saying, ‘Come locate here. We’ve got all sorts of incentives for you,’” she said. “It’s a fine line to walk for governments.”
The return of the ‘premium’ factory job Last month, Stellantis auto workers accepted a three-year deal that included a base salary increase of 25 per cent for skilled trades over the life of the agreement, not to mention bonus payments, pension improvements and two additional paid holidays per year, among other benefits. It was the “best deal in 30 years,” said Dave Cassidy, president of Unifor Local 444. And yet against a backdrop of high inflation and wage erosion, only 60 per cent of union members voted in favour of the deal.
The agreement and vote results were stark reminders of how much has changed in the industry since the Great Recession, when workers at failing Chrysler reluctantly agreed to a $19-an-hour cut in total compensation after company executives hinted Chrysler might pull out of Canada.
“The once ‘auto lotto’ jobs that went away, now those jobs are starting to be seen as premium jobs again,” Mr. Cassidy said while taking a break from a skilled trades conference at the Windsor casino.
(His union also represents workers at the casino.)
Demographics is part of the story. Labour shortages abound, and more than half of the skilled trades workers at the Stellantis assembly plant are eligible to retire right now, even as the company prepares to reinstate a third shift it dropped in 2020.
But more than that, the jobs windfall is a direct result of the muscular industrial policy programs adopted by the Ontario and federal governments that have committed tens of billions of dollars to try to make Canada a leader in EV batteries.
That’s frequently put NextStar in the line of political fire, most recently last month after the Windsor police suggested 1,600 foreign workers would be brought in to set up the plant. NextStar later said the actual number will be 900, but the lower number didn’t slow federal Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre’s attacks.
Mr. Cassidy was quick to defend NextStar and its parent Stellantis, calling Mr. Poilievre’s attacks “political hay.” He said it’s common for machinery manufacturers to temporarily send their own crews to install proprietary equipment, noting that workers from Windsor tool and die shops often travel to Mexico to install equipment. Besides, he added, the union already has 1,000 skilled trades workers at the NextStar site, a number that will grow to close to 2,000 as construction proceeds.
Still, the political fights over the plant worry Mr. Cassidy about what might happen if the federal Liberals lose power. “Pierre Poilievre being the prime minister of Canada would be disastrous,” he said.
“We would not have this battery plant here today because he calls it corporate welfare.”
Mr. Volpe at the APMA noted that opposition parties often pledge not to partner with the auto sector, then change their minds once in office because of the importance of the industry to the economy. But he shares Mr. Cassidy’s concerns that the rhetoric around the battery plant could scare other potential EV companies away from setting up in Canada.
For now, Mr. Cassidy has made it explicitly clear to Stellantis that when the battery plant begins operations in 2025, he expects all 2,500 full-time workers will be part of Local 444.
Entrepreneurs incoming While the national spotlight on Windsor has overwhelmingly focused on the NextStar plant since it was first announced, Ash Guglani likes to think of his company, Nexe Innovations Inc., as a “first mover” when it comes to the city’s revival, though with coffee pods instead of battery cells.
In 2021, the Surrey, B.C., startup was on the hunt for a location to ramp up its production of compostable coffee pods using technology that came out of the University of British Columbia. Nexe had a 10,000-square-foot facility there, but felt it needed a larger footprint that was closer to U.S. customers and a labour pool familiar with automation and manufacturing.
Windsor checked those boxes. So, Nexe snapped up a factory here that was six times larger after the site’s previous owner, an auto parts supplier, went bankrupt, at a price that was 25 per cent less than the current list price for its Surrey building. After a major renovation, the sprawling, pristine white interior in Windsor houses rows of equipment capable of churning out half a billion coffee cups annually for a company looking to shift away from plastic.
Nexe’s first shift of 15 employees started its first coffee pod production runs this fall, and other plantbased products, such as packaging for cosmetics and yogurt cups, are in the offing.
“I don’t want to knock B.C., but there’s a much more hungry work force here that is looking for the rebirth of Windsor and it seems like it’s happening,” Mr. Guglani said.
Days later, Statistics Canada jobs numbers for November reinforced that view. Though the labour market here has tightened considerably from a few years ago, Windsor still has the highest unemployment rate of any city in the country.
Nexe is part of an influx of new businesses drawn to Windsor’s proximity to the United States and lower operating costs. A short drive away, in the offices of the Downtown Windsor Business Accelerator program, Vipul Patel shows off the hardware his company, CloudExt, is developing for the hotel industry, including virtual kiosks, smart door locks and cloud-based phone systems.
An immigrant from India’s Gujarat state, he moved to Windsor two years ago through the federal startup visa program, and he has since bought an apartment and applied for permanent residency.
CloudExt now has eight employees in Canada, and dozens more in the U.S., Britain, Philippines and India. By next year, the company will have 24 employees in Canada, reflecting an expansion of the tech sector here. A report earlier this year by Technology Councils of North America found Windsor’s tech work force grew by 16 per cent from the year before, the fastest pace of any Canadian city, equal to roughly 560 new tech jobs.
Mr. Patel said he initially chose Windsor because of ease of access to the U.S. market; just that week he’d flown to Atlanta and South Carolina via Detroit, where the airport is closer to downtown Windsor than Pearson International is to many parts of Toronto. And through a WhatsApp group he shares with 300 other immigrant entrepreneurs who arrived on startup visas, he regularly hears tales of woe from other parts of the country. “It’s been easy for me compared to people who moved to Toronto,” he said. “They face basic survival issues because the cost of living is so high.”
From one housing crisis to another In 2014, when Rino Bortolin won election to Windsor city council for the first time, the city faced a housing crisis. It wasn’t a problem of too few homes, but a plague of vacant, abandoned houses blighting the landscape and contributing to crime and vandalism.
“In six short years we went from having probably the lowest real estate in North America, where you could still buy a house downtown for $60,000, to now when the cheapest house in the same neighbourhood is around $275,000,” he said.
That’s still a bargain for anyone accustomed to the housing markets in Vancouver or Toronto. The composite price of a home in Windsor is $593,000, according to the Canadian Real Estate Association, roughly half that of Toronto.
Likewise, according to the latest monthly survey on rental rates by Rentals.ca, the going rate for a onebedroom space in Windsor was $1,545 in November, up 42 per cent since the same month in 2020, but still the lowest of any city in Ontario, explaining why Windsor continues to draw residents from pricier parts of the province.
Yet the cost-of-living surge here has hit a city where the median household income adjusted for inflation had fallen 7.1 per cent from 2005 to 2019, according to a Fraser Institute report earlier this year.
While historic Walkerville, with its restaurants, shops and breweries, houses some of the city’s most affluent citizens, the equally-historic but struggling community of Sandwich, located near the Gordie Howe bridge project site, has been undergoing a slow revival while still contending with some of the lowest incomes in the region.
After serving two terms on council as director of planning, Mr. Bortolin now heads up the housing innovation lab at the Windsor Law Centre for Cities.
He’s also an outspoken critic of Windsor’s prioritization of suburban sprawl over the densification of downtown neighbourhoods, and the failure of the city to invest in low-income housing.
A 145-unit public housing development that opened in September was Windsor’s first affordable housing project in more than three decades, despite a waiting list for units more than 6,000 long, he said.
Mr. Bortolin traces the start of Windsor’s housing woes to the sudden influx of international students in the years right before the pandemic hit. At St.
Clair College, for instance, the number of international students jumped from 500 to 6,900 in three years, a massive increase in such a small city.
The college had signed a memorandum of understanding with an Ohio developer to build a $142million mixed-use “Global Village” that would house 400 students, but this week Windsor’s city council scrapped those plans, citing the slow pace of the project. The city is now looking for other residential developers it can partner with to build on the site.
Meanwhile, the city’s population surge shows no sign of letting up. In each of the past five months, the working-age population in the Windsor census metropolitan area has grown by more than 1,000, based on Statscan’s labour force survey. (The Windsor CMA also includes the towns of Lakeshore, Tecumseh, LaSalle and Amherstburg, and had 422,600 people in 2021.) That works out to a population growth rate four times faster than Windsor’s historical average before this year.
Under new home construction targets set out by the Ontario government, the City of Windsor has pledged to build an average of 1,300 new homes a year for a decade. “We’re going to be hard-pressed next year to have one-third of that met, and that 1,300 is still probably only half of what we really need when you think of all the new jobs we have coming,” Mr. Bortolin said.
The new faces of Windsor On a recent Thursday afternoon at 3 p.m., all the tables at Café Amor & Art, a coffee shop in Windsor’s trendy Walkerville neighbourhood, are packed. Latin music fills the air, and as new customers steadily file in, owner Amor Hernandez welcomes them by name.
If a recession is coming, there are no signs of a slowdown here.
Born in Mexico, Ms. Hernandez moved to Canada in 2001, settling in Toronto. But by late 2019, she’d grown tired of her daily bus-to-subway-to-streetcar commute downtown to her accounting job, and the punishing cost of living in the city. So she moved with her husband and two children to Windsor, where a niece already lived.
She had two choices: pursue another accounting job, or follow a dream of opening her own coffee shop. By March, 2020, she’d found a location to rent and bought all the equipment, drawing down the couple’s life savings and borrowing from relatives to do so. A job offer did arrive for a plum accounting job at a firm that needed her English and Spanish language skills, but she turned it down to focus on her new business. Two days later, COVID-19 lockdowns began.
Café Amor and Ms. Hernandez battled through, eventually outgrowing the original space and taking over a larger storefront that has become a cultural hub for the community. Each month, she donates her walls to a different artist to sell their work, while hosting book clubs, painting classes, language lessons and other workshops.
And her time in Windsor has given her a front row to the changing demographics of the city around her.
“When we moved here before the pandemic, you could drive as if the roads were to ourselves, it all felt empty and quiet,” she said, a stark contrast to the bustle of now. “I’ve fallen in love with Windsor.”
Sitting at a table in Cucina 360, a high-end Italian restaurant in downtown Windsor that opened its doors earlier this year, Brian Schwab points to a spot in the corner where he and his wife Lisa had their first date nearly four decades ago when it was a steakhouse. In the decades after that business failed, the building sat abandoned like many others in the area and was the sight of frequent break-ins and a fire. “It was an unmitigated disaster,” he said.
Mr. Schwab, part owner of the Windsor Spitfires junior hockey team, originally made his millions as a tech entrepreneur starting in the 1980s. These days, he’s part of a push to redevelop and revive Windsor’s beleaguered downtown, one building at a time.
All told, his investment group has bought and redeveloped more than 80,000 square feet of abandoned properties along a block in the city’s core into commercial space, and another 270,000 square feet citywide. An abandoned fish market nearby is now home to Rocket Innovation Studio, a fintech and subsidiary of Detroit-based financial services giant Rocket Cos. Inc. Likewise, another abandoned structure across the road is now offices. And, of course, the building that now houses Cucina 360.
“Our philosophy is we do a block at a time, like The downtown Windsor Caesars hotel and casino attracts millions of visitors each year.
the strategy in Monopoly where you buy up all the blue spaces,” he said. “We’re like Dan Gilbert on a wee tiny scale.”
That would be Dan Gilbert, the billionaire founder and chairman of Rocket Cos. His massive investments in downtown Detroit since 2010 helped spark that city’s rejuvenation, which many across Windsor’s political spectrum point to as an inspiration for their city.
Windsor’s downtown shares the same problems that have befallen many other Canadian urban cores in recent years, all hit hard by the opioid crisis and chronic homelessness. But Windsor was already starting from a back-foot stance. Where Windsor in the 1990s boasted a thriving core of restaurants and shops, fuelled by American visitors, the U.S. border restrictions brought on by 9/11 crushed that activity, and whatever businesses managed to survive were largely decimated by the Great Recession.
The downtown Caesars Windsor hotel and casino continues to attract millions of visitors each year, but it’s a mixed blessing. When a befuddled hotel guest asked a floor staff member how to get out to the street, she replied with winding directions and a joke: “This is the Hotel California, you can never leave.”
Renaldo Agostino, the city councillor responsible for the area and one of its biggest boosters, joins the table at Cucina 360 and lists off some of the steps being taken get downtown Windsor back on its feet.
Borrowing from Detroit’s Project Green Light, a public-private partnership in which 3,000 high-definition cameras have been installed across Motor City as crime deterrents, six Windsor businesses have installed such cameras as part of a pilot project.
A vacant urban lot that had been strewn with garbage and used needles was converted into a beach volleyball court this fall. And Mr. Agostino is part of a push to create a provincial bill that would give municipalities powers to compel owners of vacant commercial properties to improve their appearance. “I’m not saying sell your property, I’m saying keep it nice or give us the option to turn it into a gallery and make it something beneficial to the downtown core and not something that makes the core less safe and less attractive,” he said.
Change is happening. The University of Windsor and St. Clair College have both set up campuses downtown, bringing staff and students to the area.
And last month The Hive, a condo and commercial project, opened on the site of an abandoned nightclub, reportedly the first new downtown residential project in nearly 50 years.
But the revival will take time, Mr. Schwab said.
“We have to get people working downtown. Then they’ll eat and shop downtown. And then ultimately they may decide to live downtown. That’s the order of development.”
Each week seems to bring an announcement of yet another new plant or project getting under way in Windsor, and the expectation is for much more to come. As it is, industry watchers are waiting on a decision by one international company in the EV space about whether it will invest $3-billion on a new plant here or in Mexico.
And so the talk of recession that dominates so many other parts of the country at the moment feels far off from here. If all goes well, the investments made in Windsor will pay dividends to the rest of Canada in the coming years. When completed, the Gordie Howe bridge will boost the country’s trade capacity, while the modernization the manufacturing sector in Windsor, as well as other hubs across Ontario and Quebec, will deliver the potential for higher productivity and help reverse the slump in Canadian living standards.
Plenty can still go wrong. It is by no means certain the transition to EVs will unfold as quickly as the industry hopes, and the inability of Canada to secure access to critical minerals may hobble its electric-battery ambitions, raising further questions about the vast sums governments are spending on the industry. But it all makes Windsor an important city to watch in the months and years to come. It’s been a long time since that’s been the case.

Full text: 410 Cranbrooke Ave., Toronto LED BURY PARK Asking price: $2,799,000 (October, 2023) Selling price: $2,999,000 (October, 2023) Previous selling price: $2,798,000 (October, 2016) Taxes: $13,172 (2023) Days on the market: Seven Listing agents: Andre Kutyan and Robert Greenberg, Harvey Kalles Real Estate Ltd.
THE ACTION This four-bedroom house abutting Brookdale Park was listed for $1,000 more than the owners paid in 2016, a strategy that succeeded in attracting a large number of interested potential buyers.
“The house was underbuilt for the size of the lot,” agent Andre Kutyan said. “A new home on a 50-foot lot is around 4,000 to 4,500 square feet, and this one is just shy of 2,800. So depending on price, it could go either way as a home to live in, like my clients, or to tear down.
“Another option was someone could sever it into two lots because there are 25-footers on that block.”
Three buyers submitted bids, all with similar monetary offers.
The tiebreaker was a rapid possession date in November.
“Today, to move something and get multiple offers, either the price has to be too good to be true or it’s a special property – like a unicorn like this – or a combination thereof,” Mr. Kutyan said.
“Pending the [new municipal] luxury land transfer tax coming in on Jan. 1, my clients were looking to close in 2023, so that was a deciding factor.
“And even the buyers’ offers didn’t hit $3-million because at $3-million it’s $10,000 more in land transfer tax than at $2,999,000.”
WHAT THEY GOT This 21-year-old house has the dining room, an eat-in kitchen and entertaining areas on the main and lower levels.
Outside, there’s a carport, an in-ground pool, and a guest house with a bedroom, bathroom and lounging area.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “The street doesn’t go to Avenue Road and doesn’t go to Bathurst [Street], so it’s a dead end on both sides, so there’s very little traffic,” Mr. Kutyan said.
“There is a walking path to Avenue Road, so you can access some of the best retail in the area, like Pusateri’s, local restaurants, banks and whatever you need.
“It also backs onto a ravine, so it has a lot going for it in terms of location.”

Full text: As provincial governments across Canada struggle to bring down the cost of housing and increase its availability, British Columbia, where some of the country’s least affordable housing markets are concentrated, has spent the past year making a series of major policy changes aimed at getting people into homes.
The province’s NDP government has set housing targets, and moved to require municipal governments to meet them. It has put in place measures to ensure major transit nodes become dense neighbourhoods, and created a series of preapproved home designs that builders can use to construct four-unit multiplexes with relative ease. And it has done away with time-consuming public hearings on building projects that conform with cities’ official community plans.
These are just a few among 22 housing-related announcements and legislative actions by the province in the past year – most in the past two months, many of which have passed in the legislature quickly, with little debate.
The breakneck pace of housing reform in B.C. has far outstripped efforts by other provinces and the federal government.
But while B.C.’s efforts have been lauded by some observers for tackling the housing crisis head on, the flurry of changes has provoked concerns among others, who worry the dramatic shift will have unintended consequences.
Those who praise the government’s efforts include academics, housing experts and developers.
“They’re far ahead of anyone else when it comes to ambition and policy seriousness,” said Mike Moffatt, a Western University economics professor and senior director at the Smart Prosperity Institute, who recently co-authored a report on how to tackle Canada’s rental-housing shortage. “What impresses me the most is that they recognize there’s no one silver bullet. The entire package is impressive.”
Murtaza Haider, a Toronto Metropolitan University professor who specializes in data science and real-estate management, said B.C. is doing everything it can to squeeze room out of existing housing while it works on getting new homes built in future years.
Anne McMullin, the chief executive officer of B.C.’s Urban Development Institute, which represents builders, was similarly effusive. “We have not seen this kind of fundamental change for decades,” she said.
Even some B.C. residents say they are excited about the potential arrival of new kinds of housing.
In Vancouver, where Gordon Coleman and his family have lived in a four-storey condo building on West Broadway in the city’s Kitsilano neighbourhood for two decades, Mr. Coleman said he hopes his building is one day demolished and replaced with something taller. It’s within 750 metres of the Burrard SkyTrain station, making it an ideal place for greater residential density.
He worries, though, that a wave of development would mean losing some beloved neighbourhood businesses.
“But I want my children to have a place to live,” he said. He believes the only way his teenage boys will be able to stay in Vancouver is if there is a massive increase in housing supply, and a resulting levelling out of housing prices.
An equally broad range of observers are concerned about possible negative consequences from the province’s rapid changes.
Among them is former NDP premier Mike Harcourt, who has blasted the government’s plans, especially for dense housing near transit, saying they are “arbitrary, top-down changes in local zoning and development controls” that will threaten existing low-cost apartments, heritage areas and overall regional planning.
Trish Mandewo, president of the Union of B.C. Municipalities, which represents cities in the province, has said that although civic politicians welcome housing reforms, the province’s efforts have been a mixed bag.
In, October, she noted, the B.C.
government announced that it would prohibit short-term rentals in investment properties.
With few exceptions, such rentals will be allowed only in people’s principal residences.
Ms. Mandewo said this has produced positive changes, particularly in Victoria, where investors have already started putting their condos up for sale, somewhat easing conditions in the tight local housing market.
But, she said, government proposals aimed at dramatically increasing density were created unilaterally, without any consultation with cities.
“Our members are concerned these pieces are not quite thought through. We’re hearing about a risk of displacement,” she said, referencing fears that renters in older apartment buildings and houses could be ousted in favour of new development.
The provincial government has not said what measures, if any, cities will be allowed to put in place in order to make sure renters are compensated if their buildings are redeveloped.
It’s also not clear how cities will pay for the infrastructure that needs to go along with new development, such as sewers, water service, roads, parks, hospitals, schools and libraries.
Garnet Harry, who has lived for a quarter century in a house 450 metres from the Kootenay Loop, a major bus loop in east Vancouver, said he is alarmed about the possible consequences of development, though he added that he is not opposed to change.
“I just don’t think the infrastructure is here. This neighbourhood will get ruined,” he said.
Vancouver city councillor Pete Fry said he is particularly concerned about one piece of proposed legislation intended to standardize the fees developers pay to governments. It will, in effect, prohibit cities from using this money for affordable housing.
“That’s a big flag for me,” he said. In 2022, the city allocated $32-million to affordable housing out of the $219-million it collected in these fees.
West Vancouver-Capilano MLA Karin Kirkpatrick, the housing critic for the BC United Party, an opposition political party in the province, said she is skeptical of the government’s approach, which she characterized as scattershot.
“You can’t do one thing at a time. It should be comprehensive,” she said. “You dump too many things at one time and it’s bound to fail.”
She said there seems to be no co-ordinated plan for improving transit, schools and infrastructure in step with the increases in population that accompany new housing development. She added that residents could end up paying a high price to make those improvements.
Even housing advocates who see positives in the province’s efforts say not enough is being done to protect renters and build social housing.
“I think what they’re doing is big, and it’s a shame this qualifies as big because there are so many gaps,” said Alexandra Flynn, director of the University of British Columbia’s Housing Research Collaborative. “It’s very marketbased. We’re not approaching this as, ‘let’s get everybody housed,’ but instead, ‘let’s build a lot of housing and hope that solves the problem.’” B.C’s annual spending on new subsidized housing has risen from $38-million to $641-million since the NDP was elected in 2017.
The province budgeted $4.2-billion in 2023 for all of its housing programs.
B.C. Premier David Eby told a packed housing convention in Vancouver last month that his government of “known radicals” is going to push for even more housing-related changes in the months ahead.
And provincial Housing Minister Ravi Kahlon said in an interview that he is equally resolute.
He said the province’s housing actions to date are part of a strategy, and that he expects to introduce legislation in the new year to “reform Vancouver’s decisionmaking process” by amending the Vancouver Charter.
The province will also be kicking off its BC Builds initiative, which will focus on taking charge of new construction on vacant or underutilized properties that belong to various levels of government.
Mr. Kahlon has asked agencies and municipal politicians to contact him in September with lists of possible sites.
He acknowledged that there has been criticism of the province’s housing efforts. But, he said, “There’s a lot of young folks saying, ‘We’re feeling hopeful now.’ ”

Homebuyers stand pat, expecting prices to slide further

Full text: Canadian home prices are heading into a steeper slide than previously expected, according to economists at Toronto-Dominion Bank.
TD economist Rishi Sondhi is now forecasting that the average national home price will drop 10 per cent through the early part of next year from the third quarter of 2023.
That marks a more severe fall than TD’s September forecast, when the bank was predicting prices would decline about 5 per cent over the same period.
Mr. Sondhi says the Bank of Canada has held its benchmark rate steady at 5 per cent for the past two policy-setting meetings, as TD expected.
The revision is mainly based on the fact that bond yields, which underpin mortgage rates, climbed in September and October.
Borrowers trying to qualify for a mortgage with a rate higher than 6 per cent needed to pass a “stress test” rate above 8 per cent.
Another culprit is the surge in new listings that flooded into the housing market in Ontario and British Columbia.
In Ontario, the sales-to-newlistings ratio plunged to 39 per cent in October from 63 per cent in May, Mr. Sondhi says.
“Conditions very much support buyers,” says the economist.
Mr. Sondhi says one reason for the unusually high level of new listings in Ontario appears to be that some condo investors in Toronto and Hamilton are exiting the market. The climb in condo units for sale in those and other cities suggests that over-leveraged investors are choosing not to hold on to their properties.
Potential buyers throughout the market, meanwhile, are holding off in case prices have farther to fall.
“Why would you buy now if you can wait and get a better price?” Mr. Sondhi points out.
Still, a 10-per-cent drop in national average prices would still leave them 15 per cent higher than before the COVID-19 pandemic.
Mr. Sondhi cautions, however, that weaker economic growth or higher-than-expected interest rates could further worsen the forecast.
While unemployment has risen from record lows set last year, the jobs market continues to muddle along, he says, adding that consumers are more worried about the outlook.
“It’s certainly our view that consumer spending will slow,” he says.
On the upside, strong population growth should buoy housing demand, and fewer listings than TD is currently predicting may arrive on the market in the coming months, which in turn would lead to a slightly more shallow decline.
Mr. Sondhi is not looking for any dramatic shifts in the landscape as 2023 comes to an end.
“The headwinds facing the consumer and tailwinds supporting the consumer are probably going to continue to some degree in the near term,” he says.
Consumers appear to be running out of steam, according to the latest data from Statistics Canada. The pace of inflation fell to 3.1 per cent in October compared with a year earlier, which marks a slowdown from an annual growth rate of 3.8 per cent in September.
Royal Bank of Canada economist Claire Fan says signs that consumers are reining in their spending, along with a faltering labour market, suggest that inflation will continue to moderate in the months ahead.
She believes the Bank of Canada will not see the need to raise rates again but will cautiously pivot to cuts in the second half of 2024.
Daren King, economist at National Bank of Canada, is predicting that house prices will continue to slide as the market faces challenges in the form of the current relatively high level of interest rates and a less favourable economic backdrop.
Mr. King says that the Teranet-National Bank Composite Index fell 0.4 per cent in October after rising for five months.
After seasonal adjustment, seven of the 11 metropolitan markets that make up the index were in positive territory. The biggest drop was seen in Toronto, which decreased 1.6 per cent. Edmonton, Vancouver and Ottawa-Gatineau also ended up in negative territory.
The Teranet-National Bank HPI tracks prices after they have been recorded at land registry offices, which means the numbers lag those of local real estate boards.
The downturn in prices came with a seasonally adjusted 5.6-per-cent drop in national sales in October from September.
The drop was the fourth monthly contraction in a row and the sharpest slowdown in sales since June, 2022, Mr. King points out.
Mr. King says Toronto is hardest-hit because the country’s largest city also has the richest prices.
“There’s definitely a problem with affordability in Toronto that we’re not seeing in Calgary or Montreal.”
The slowdown comes despite strong population growth, he adds.
“I don’t think it’s a demand problem – I think it’s the market conditions that are horrible.”
Move-up buyers, he says, are discouraged because interest rates are so high.
National Bank is forecasting that the Bank of Canada will cut its key rate by 25 basis points in the second quarter of next year, with three additional cuts in 2024.
Across Canada, sellers began cancelling their listings in October, Mr. King adds, which in turn limited the increase in supply.
Still, months of inventory swelled to 4.1 in October from 3.7 in September and is now roughly back in line with its prepandemic level, he says.
“Months of inventory” describes the time it would take to sell all available listings at the current pace of sales.
Mr. King warns that one risk to the outlook that economists are watching closely is the health of the jobs market.
Homeowners will do everything they can to continue to keep their house, he says, but unemployment can make that impossible.
“If you lose your job, or see your hours cut, that’s another story,” he says. “You’re not able to pay your mortgage at all.”
Mr. King believes the first quarter of 2024 may be a good time for buyers in a solid financial position to buy before a potential rebound in prices later next year.
“If you need a house, it’s still a good time if you can afford it and you can qualify,” he says. “Just imagine all of the people who live with their parents and want to move out.”

Turning suburb into city: Do these architects have the recipe?: Developers struggling to create walkable neighbourhoods in car-centric communities

Full text: ARCHITECTURE CRITIC How do you transform a piece of suburb into a piece of city? This is a massive question in North American architecture and urban design – acutely so in the Toronto region.
Here more than a dozen former shopping malls are planned to be rebuilt as mixeduse, walkable neighbourhoods of housing and retail. Big “master-planned” projects, to use the industry jargon, will also remake several industrial areas.
Toronto’s Giannone Petricone Architects (GPAIA) are urban designers on many of these, shaping these districts alongside planners and landscape architects. Their work will touch the lives of hundreds of thousands.
And while their work is the best of its kind in the Toronto region, it’s not good enough. Big Toronto projects will require a different design planning at all scales.
I recently sat down with GPAIA’s Ralph Giannone and Pina Petricone to discuss their recipe for such large-scale projects.
“It’s about taking the suburban and nudging it towards the urban,” Mr. Giannone said. What he means is changing a car-oriented place into one where people can and will move around car-free. He and Ms. Petricone, who are married, have been doing such jobs for 25 years, starting with the Mississauga neighbourhood of Port Credit and Toronto’s Shops at Don Mills.
These megaprojects are where Toronto has chosen to cram much of its new growth – “cruise ships of urbanity,” as Mr. Giannone told me, in a sea of houses. As such they provide an opportunity to create citylike density and activity.
The architects believe, rightly, that the most important element in this work is good public space. Don Mills, which opened in 2008, has a publicly accessible square in the middle. “The theory was, we needed to create a sense of place immediately,” Mr. Giannone said, “and create a place that people would actually want to be.” That square is lined by streets and sidewalks. Throughout the Don Mills centre, stores face the outdoors, and you can walk there. Many visitors drive, and there are multistorey parking garages to serve them. This is laudable.
Don Mills also makes an attempt to create some kind of street life, the stuff that happens when people get out of their cars and encounter each other. Here, the architects are less successful.
GPAIA attempted to create diversity between the storefronts. They are made from a variety of different colours and materials, mimicking the diversity that comes naturally in older commercial streets that developed over time, such as Bloor Street, lined with many narrow storefronts.
“What I love about Toronto’s main streets is this messiness of mercantile experience,” Mr. Giannone explains. “How do we do that without making it too …”, “Contrived,” his partner finished. “Contrived,” he agreed.
And that is a challenge. It is difficult to simulate that “mess” in a district where everything is constructed at once; owned by the same people; and where most of the stores are actually very big, not mom-andpops.
GPAIA’s approach to this problem has not been convincing. They surround each shopfront with “picture frames,” as Ms. Petricone calls them – exaggerated rectangles, often of brightly coloured aluminum panels.
That strategy carries forward into some of GPAIA’s more recent projects, including one in the Golden Mile area of Scarborough for Choice Properties REIT and The Daniels Corporation. This strategy doesn’t work very well, because the storefronts are treated as graphic elements only one level high, and many of the materials are imagined as aluminum panels and glass. Even in the drawings, they feel like faux storefronts tacked onto large spaces and large buildings – which is exactly what they are.
GPAIA has its strengths. Their interiors for the Terroni restaurants are some of the best rooms in Toronto, and their Royal Hotel in Picton, Ont., is a sophisticated cocktail of new and old. But they can’t solve this problem of making something monolithic and new feel like something diverse and old.
So what is a good solution? More, smaller retailers should be an absolute requirement. And the architecture should employ masonry – brick, stone, or even small panels of concrete – to deliver a feeling of consistency and solidity at the pedestrian level. Once the identity of a building is clear, then signage can play a secondary role.
At the same time, public space must have a direct relationship with nearby buildings: Doors, storefronts and patios should connect directly to the public space. All these qualities show up in the master plans for two recent Toronto projects by London architects Allies & Morrison, including Beltline Yards.
On more typical developments, such as GPAIA’s, streets get in the way of public life. “We are obsessed with designing streetscapes as outdoor collective experiences,” Ms. Petricone says. But their power is limited by the work of transportation engineers and some City of Toronto policies.
The public policy consensus is clear: Streets with cars must go throughout the neighbourhood, and these streets must be extremely wide. This creates a hostile and unpleasant public realm.
Take the Golden Mile project. Here a planned park is lined on three sides by streets. The design, with Bousfields and MBTW Group, shows the streets with 8.5 metres of asphalt lined by boulevards of about 5.6 metres on each side. That means each building is at least 20 metres, or 65 feet, away from the new park.
The public space is surrounded by a moat of big, fast-moving cars, and lots of semi-dead space in which people will not gather. None of this will ever feel like a city; nor will it feel pleasant.
For such new districts to work well, designers, builders and planners must focus relentlessly on a few aspects of these projects: public squares designed for pedestrian comfort. Retail and restaurants that have a strong direct relationship with public space. And roads that are designed to slow cars, or push them out of the picture.
In the Golden Mile development, there is one welcome element: a fully pedestrian street lined with shops. “This is more in line with where the future of this place is going,” Ms. Petricone told me. “These places will continue to evolve for decades into the future.” They will, and hopefully the way we build such places will evolve as well. Even the most thoughtful of local architects don’t yet have the right answers for their future.

Full text: DONE DEAL 176 Kananaskis Way, Unit 304, Canmore, Alta.
CANMORE Asking price: $450,000 (June, 2023) Selling price: $445,000 (October, 2023) Taxes: $1,815 (2023) Days on the market: 112 Listing agents: Christopher Vincent and Laura Wright, Sotheby’s International Realty Canada THE ACTION This 644-square-foot unit only has one bedroom rather than two like most models at Whiskey Jack Chalets, a building designated for employee accommodations in Canmore, outside Banff National Park. The uncommon setup worked for one prospective purchaser, but conditions placed on the offer scuttled the deal. A second buyer made no such demands and closed the deal at $445,000, just $5,000 shy of the asking price.
“There are two buildings built side by side, and they have employee housing use [provisions] on them, so they require anyone living in the property to work at least 20 hours [weekly] in the valley,” said agent Christopher Vincent. Such provisions, common in the resort town, are an effort to help ensure affordable living spaces for employees in the local tourism industry.
WHAT THEY GOT This 22-year-old unit is surrounded by outdoor attractions, from an extensive pathway system right behind the boutique building to picturesque mountains visible from its balcony and multiple windows in the living room.
There’s a four-piece bathroom and new laundry machines, as well as an open-concept kitchen with a peninsula, a breakfast bar, and updated appliances.
A storage locker and two underground parking spots complete the package. Monthly fees are $555.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “It’s on the top floor and it’s south-facing, so it has really nice views and gets good sun,” Mr. Vincent said.
“It’s also super central, maybe a 15-minute walk downtown, which is nice.”

Full text: There’s something about arriving by water.
Whether it’s a mahogany water taxi pulling up to a historic palazzo on Venice’s Grand Canal or a car-ferry ride to a far-offshore cabin in the woods, the time spent cruising towards your destination has a way of easing you into the getaway mindset like no airplane, train or tour bus can.
Case in point: the catamaran that shuttles guests between the Antigua mainland and Jumby Bay Island, a private retreat two miles off the Caribbean destination’s northern coast. Even though you know you’re headed to one of the world’s most buzzed about beach resorts (part of the Oetker collection of hotels that includes the legendary Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc in the south of France and the opulent Bristol in Paris), a quick few minutes at sea crossfades your stress level and sense of anticipation so you disembark more than ready to relax.
True to its recent history as a car-free enclave of oceanfront villas that evolved into the resort it is today, Jumby Bay Island has the feeling of a private estate. Despite ample rolling green lawns, there’s no golf course. Instead, a cruiser bike loop of the 300-acre property reveals tennis courts, an organic farm and secluded beaches. Oetker took on managing the property in 2017 and its most recent addition are its ocean view suites with their contemporary take on Caribbean architecture, aqua hues and expansive windows that bring the sea into your living space.
For larger groups, Oetker also manages a pool of 21 of the island’s private residences. With between four and nine bedrooms and names such as Lazy Lizard and Turtle Crossing, they can be booked and staffed for group getaways.
Hotel guests, however, get to take full advantage of Jumby Bay’s all-inclusive format. Whether at the bar or the main beach, Drappier Brut champagne flows freely. Dining options include the Estate House, a refined spot with curved banquettes, palm murals and a crowd of hotel guests and villa residents that dress up for dinner. Other perks include rum tastings at the beach bar and island circumnavigating tours when you can ogle the local real estate.
All spa visits, gratis wine and other vacation treats aside, what makes Jumby Bay feel most special is its ever-present flora and fauna. In the morning, don’t be surprised if the island’s flock of black headed Persian sheep are grazing on the lawn in front of your suite. Cruising back from a snorkelling trip often includes a stop to spot Hawksbill turtles bobbing in the sea (since 1987, the Jumby Bay Hawksbill Turtle Project has ensured its beaches remain a viable nesting ground for the endangered species).
While you reluctantly board the catamaran home, it’s these encounters that will be playing in your mind as you plan your return. – ANDREW SARDONE Ocean view suite stays from US$2,295/night all-inclusive through oetkercollection.com.

B.C. policy advisers warn of unintended consequences of new housing measures: Push to add more density near transit could mean condos replace rental housing

Full text: The B.C. provincial government has introduced a host of new housing measures this month that would give it the authority of municipal planning departments. That move alone has raised eyebrows among housing experts who wonder if the province has the expertise to pull it off.
One bill in particular, which calls for significant new height and density around transit areas, will require more collaboration with local governments if it is going to protect citizens against displacement, those who are involved in housing policy say.
One out of every three renters in Metro Vancouver lives within the transit-oriented development areas, according to a new analysis from Andy Yan, director of Simon Fraser University’s City Program.
Those numbers concern the Union of B.C. Municipalities (UBCM), and others.
“We are certainly supportive of the need to increase housing in British Columbia but we are concerned that some of this legislation is being enacted very quickly and that we haven’t had time to review it all and provide input, and, most importantly, to make sure there aren’t unintended consequences,” says Craig Hodge, chair of the Union of B.C. Municipalities community safety committee, which represents local governments in regard to federal and provincial policies. Mr. Hodge also represents the UBCM on the board at Metro Vancouver and is a Coquitlam city councillor.
“There are four or five pieces of legislation that affect housing that are all coming down within a one-month period,” he says.
“Some are being passed; some are still waiting to be passed; and some of them are waiting to see what the regulations are that are going to follow as part of it.
“I think what the provincial government is doing is something we support, which is trying to increase the supply of housing and trying to make sure it’s affordable. But these changes are very wide-sweeping.”
The UBCM is pushing for tools such as inclusionary zoning, which is the inclusion of rental and below-market-rate housing within new development, Mr. Hodge says. It is typically negotiated in exchange for more density.
“That’s what we are asking for,” Mr. Hodge says. “Certainly the legislation, the concept is very good, having density around rapid transit stations.
“One of the ways to ensure that new construction is affordable is inclusionary zoning. But we need the province to make the legislative changes to make sure that tool is available to us, and one of the options that we have.
“As of yet, the province has not introduced necessary legislation to support that. So what we need now is the province to engage with local governments to develop this tool together.”
Prof. Yan has concerns that the province’s new legislation to massively increase density around transit hubs – which is a sound planning principle recognized around the world – could have detrimental implications for existing rental housing if not thoughtfully implemented.
Prof. Yan released a report this week that showed that Bill 47 – which proposes mid- to high-rise towers in an 800-metre radius around rapid transit and 400 metres around bus exchanges – has more potential to affect existing rental than Vancouver’s Broadway Plan which is already being implemented.
The legislation, if enacted next month, would set minimum allowable heights for proposed transit areas throughout the province.
In Vancouver, 43 per cent of purpose-built rental stock falls within proposed transit-oriented development areas that the province has identified for upzoning, he says. That’s a much higher percentage than the 500-block Broadway Plan, which contains 25 per cent of the city’s purposebuilt rental stock.
Because the buildings within the transit areas are older, they are poised for redevelopment.
Eighty-nine per cent of the buildings within the transit areas are more than 50 years old.
The bill works in conjunction with a couple of other bills that would exert control over municipal authority.
Bill 44 would remove public hearings, parking requirements and heritage protections, and upzone single-family lots to six-unit multiplexes. Bill 46 would eliminate the use of community amenity contributions (CACs) and introduce a new amenity cost charge, among other changes for development fees.
Craig E. Jones has studied transportation, land use and redevelopment pressures on purpose-built rentals for several years, as part of his PhD in geography. Mr. Jones, who is the research co-ordinator for University of B.C.’s Housing Research Collaborative, is not surprised that there is such a large concentration of rental stock around existing and proposed transit zones.
He supports densification around transit areas, but he notes that it will impact mostly east-side neighbourhoods instead of the wealthier west-side areas.
“Where does the responsibility lie to ensure that there aren’t a bunch of renters that are displaced by this? That’s what is a bit unclear,” he says.
“I think part of the angle here that gets overlooked from time to time is that the location of transit infrastructure is political – where rapid transit stations get placed is not a politically neutral process.
“So now, the infrastructure is in place, and now it becomes politically, ‘we have to densify now around that location.’ We don’t have rapid transit stations west of Arbutus right? There is a bit of a class element to where the infrastructure is put.”
Consultant and SFU instructor Christina DeMarco is the former lead planner for Metro Vancouver’s 2011 Regional Growth Strategy and also worked on the city of Vancouver’s City Plan and transportation plan. She’s worked on plans in Ontario and Australia.
Ms. DeMarco applauds the province for directly addressing the affordability crisis. But she also has concerns that the province is “heavy-handed” in its approach.
The transit-oriented development policy is “a very blunt tool” that could backfire, she says.
“First, it’s mostly an affordable housing crisis that we are dealing with and I don’t think they are going to get affordable housing this way. If developers have a choice between condos and rentals, they will continue to choose condos because it’s more profitable and it’s very likely that lower-cost rental buildings could be replaced by condos. So we would actually be losing the lower-cost stock in favour of condo development.
“I don’t really understand if they want to give away density bonuses, why not just target the specific parts of the market where housing is needed – the private market rental, assisted housing, co-op housing, that type of housing that is not well provided at all right now?
“The second thing is I see the policy is scheduled to be put in place for most Metro Vancouver municipalities in December, so that means no planning for the land uses they need to provide complete neighbourhoods.
“The way I understand it, a developer can say, ‘Okay, the province said I can build 20 storeys here, so here’s my rezoning application.’ What latitude do the municipalities have to evaluate that development, to make sure that it’s compatible with development around it?” She’s also concerned by the blanket approach, assuming the same densities and heights for neighbourhoods as diverse as Kitsilano and Fleetwood, in Surrey.
“I think they are trying to do too much too quickly and undervaluing the importance of community planning, and building complete communities,” Ms. DeMarco says.
Developer Michael Geller said there are still many questions around the sweeping initiatives, which, he agrees, are taking away some municipal planning functions.
“While I’ve been generally supportive of all these initiatives, I am beginning to think that some of these initiatives have not been thought through,” Mr. Geller says.
One concern he has is that landowners within the transit zones will expect their properties to be worth a lot more than what is financially viable in order for a developer to build.
“It’s about trying to get the right balance between what a property owner thinks their land is worth, what BC Assessment thinks it’s worth, and what a developer knows they can pay.”
The Ministry of Housing did not respond to questions by deadline.

Full text: Nestled on an escarpment with expansive views of Kicking Horse Mountain in Golden, B.C., Edelweiss Village comprises six Swiss-inspired chalets on a 50-acre site. In July, Montayne, a real estate consulting and development group based in Canmore, Alta., seized the opportunity to invest in the midst of the Rocky and the Columbia Mountains.
“It’s really exciting times for the area,” says Devin Stephens, a partner at Montayne and a Canmore realtor, pointing at the recent surge of investment in Golden, including the expansion of the Trans-Canada Highway, as well two new offerings from the attractions and hospitality company Pursuit, the Golden Skybridge and the Railrider Mountain Coaster.
“We’ve seen this happen with most mountain markets, and Golden has been late to see this.”
But Edelweiss Village represents more than a prime investment opportunity.
Listed at $2.3-million, the property is one of the last remaining vestiges of the birth of modern mountaineering and mountain tourism in Canada.
“We’ve heard from many people within the town, as well as the mayor, that Golden wouldn’t be what it is today without Edelweiss Village,” says Colby Genoway, who is also a partner at Montayne.
In the early 1910s, the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) built Edelweiss Village to provide permanent housing to the Swiss mountaineers the company hired to safely guide visitors in the mountains, a move that would boost tourism in the region.
One of the Swiss guides, Walter Feuz, bought the property in 1959, and it remained in his family since.
“The family maintained the property for many years,” says Eddie Leigan, the seller’s realtor, noting that it was very important for his clients to find a buyer who’d look after Edelweiss Village. “This group that came together to purchase the property – it was clear they were a good fit.”
Indeed, the restoration of the chalets began shortly after Montayne acquired the site. “We would not have taken on the project if we didn’t see that we could potentially find a way to restore it,” Mr. Genoway says.
While the chalets were maintained in a fair condition, the buildings needed significant repairs, as rot had overtaken some of the intricate woodwork of the façades. “Buildings that are 100 years old need constant attention and work,” Mr. Genoway says.
“And they can’t just be maintained, they need to be reinvested into.”
Although Montayne’s concrete plans for Edelweiss Village are still in the works, the group’s vision embraces the cultural significance of the site.
“Our vision is to blend Edelweiss’s history with modern amenities to create a unique and fun experience for locals and tourists,” Mr. Stephens says. “We want to build something that educates and also allows visitors to embrace the rich mountain culture and Canadian heritage.”
Despite this, the long-term preservation of the property remains in jeopardy.
Because Edelweiss Village is located just outside of the town of Golden, in the Columbia-Shuswap Regional District, there is no heritage legislation in place to protect it.
Concerned about this, Illona Spaar, a Swiss-Canadian historian and author based in Vancouver, co-founded Swiss Edelweiss Village Foundation, a non-profit organization conceived in 2022 to raise awareness and ensure the preservation of the site.
“The Swiss mountain guides took on the strongest role when it came to impacting the mountain culture for which the Canadian Rocky Mountains are so famous for,” Ms. Spaar says, noting that the expertise these guides brought to Canada was key for the successful introduction of mountain tourism in Western Canada.
Currently, Ms. Spaar’s foundation is working to create a community heritage register for the area, which would pave the way to designating the site as a heritage asset and protecting it from demolition. But doing that takes time and will eventually require the owner’s buy-in.
“We are working with a heritage consultant,” Ms. Spaar says.
“It’s quite a large process. So we’re working toward that.”
This problem isn’t unique to Edelweiss Village – nor to B.C.
According to Chris Wiebe, a manager of heritage policy and government relations at the National Trust for Canada, designating heritage sites in rural areas is an ongoing challenge. Across Western Canada, culturally significant properties such as grain elevators, barns, bridges, as well as natural landscapes, are at risk of being lost due to a lack of heritage protections.
“Smaller rural municipalities don’t necessarily have the capacity to put resources toward trying to understand and protect important places,” Mr. Wiebe says.
“Canada doesn’t have very many financial resources … to try to sustain and provide a future for places that are significant and viable, like the Edelweiss cabins.”
Moreover, because access to the patchwork of federal, provincial and municipal programs across the country isn’t always straightforward, rural property owners might not be aware of the resources available to maintain designated heritage properties, such as tax credits and rehabilitation grants.
“Historic places in rural areas need more attention in Canada,” Mr. Wiebe says. “There’s a lot of attention in urban areas right now, just in terms of the housing challenges and thinking about density – but we shouldn’t forget about rural areas.”

Full text: While I am lucky enough to have never experienced writer’s block, I am now convinced, after touring the new exhibit at the City of Toronto Archives (255 Spadina Rd.)
that I need not fear should it rear its ugly head.
On display until August, 2024, If These Walls Could Talk – Researching the History of Where You Live, proves that a deep dive into any property – from a humble, clapboard cottage in North York to a Gothic mansion downtown or even a strip mall in the (former) town of Weston – will reveal a cast of characters that can compete with the protagonists and villains found at the local bookstore. And oh, the research rabbit holes that open! There are topics as far-ranging as aviation, strong independent women, British Home Children, a princess and even a Hollywood celebrity.
“So the Women’s Council have leased these 24 apartments, all on the south side, and the secretary, her name is Minnie Irvine … decides she’s going to take a three-bedroom unit and she’s going to run all of the affairs of the [Women’s Council] from Bain,” says Toronto Archives researcher Jessica Algie of the Bain Apartments Co-operative in Riverdale.
“So they invite Lord and Lady Aberdeen to come to tea right when the Bain opens [in 1915].”
Ms. Algie then skips to the 1970s to talk about when the 260 “cottage flats” (as designed by prominent arts and crafts architect Eden Smith) were known as the “Red Bain” because of links to prominent left-wing politicians such as John Sewell and Peter Tabuns, and then, a bit later, when the complex, which has always housed creative types, had its own private television station.
“It’s stranger than fiction,” she laughs.
Similarly, when co-curator Neil Brochu was unpacking the long life of 295 George St. – a tall, semi-detached, 1856 house just a stone’s throw from the infamous Fillmores Hotel strip club – and its half-century as home to the Fegan Boys Home from 1886 to 1937 (a network of residences for impoverished or orphaned British children), that he was able to add more layers to the story: “the city operated a boy’s home up the street – we now have Seaton House that’s there. There was a YMCA on Pembroke [Street]/ … Starting in the late 19th century there was a real concentration of social services, particularly catering to children.”
“It was designed as an upper middle-class area, so it’s when Rosedale and Forest Hill were built that these neighbourhoods off Jarvis [Street] and Sherbourne [Street] started to depopulate.”
From the (former) mansions of Jarvis and Sherbourne Streets the exhibit takes us to 12 Alexis Blvd. in North York. There, between sturdy postwar bungalows, sits an “odd-looking little structure that is remarkably old,” co-curator Sarah Carson says.
With an off-centre front door, a pair of lonely double-hung windows and a repair done in bare plywood (it was hit by a car), it’s not the sort of dwelling that would ever grace the cover of a magazine, yet, Ms. Carson says, this turn-of-the-20th-century house and the neighbouring property were owned by the Neal family from 1915 until 2016 – a family that has a strong connection to aviation history. John Neal’s son, George, found employment at the brand new De Havilland plant in 1937; in 1941 he enlisted in the Royal Canadian Airforce, but rejoined De Havilland in 1946. Two years later, he became chief test pilot. In 1995, Neal was inducted into the Canadian Aviation Hall of Fame.
Even postwar strip malls have rich histories. By 1961, most of 1692-1732 Jane St. had been built, and signs had been put up to find commercial and residential tenants. By 1963 there was Vella Supermarket and Vella Shoes (run by Grazio and Carmella Vella who live on St. Clair Avenue West), a “travel agency and European gift centre,” a dry cleaner, drug store and Alexandra [photography] Studio. Interestingly, the Toronto Archives hold 10,000 negatives from this studio, since it dates back to 1874. Residential tenants range from sales clerks and housewives to a “serviceman with Pepsi-Cola” and a pair of design engineers with De Havilland.
“It made ownership more accessible because they are small units, you’re not buying the entire strip mall,” Ms. Carson says.
“And it was also an affordable type of rental [housing] as well, but also quite accessible; it’s on main transit routes, it’s at Jane and Lawrence, there’re businesses right beneath you.”
And speaking of the postwar period, the 1959-1961 subdivision of Midland Park, where your humble Architourist lived from 2005 to 2010, is featured also.
While some of my research into the 750-home enclave was used (the builder, Curran Hall Ltd., was owned by politician Paul Hellyer and the house models were designed by architect Edward Ross), it is the continued good work of my former neighbour, Lisa Duperreault, and her formation of the Midland Park Modernism Alliance, that has kept this special place in the spotlight.
As for the princess and the Hollywood celebrity, the exhibit finds Princess Margaret (and Lord Snowdon) singing show tunes at the “11th-floor home of Mrs. Edmont Frankel” at 330 Spadina Rd. (Tower Hill Apartments by WZMH, 1965), and Mary Pickford autographing the front door of 90 Glenwood Cres. in East York. The 1942 bungalow (still there today) was raffled off to 48year-old George Ellis, a boilerroom worker with Consumers Gas. “When informed of his win,” the exhibit’s text tells us, “Ellis says, ‘I’ll tell you this … it’s too good for me. I’ll sell it alright.’ ” Although there are just 11 properties featured, If These Walls Could Talk tells hundreds of stories that will keep gallerygoers enthralled for weeks after viewing.
“It’s a bit like genealogy,” Mr. Brochu says. “You go from a very ego-drive space – I want to know something about me and this place and how I fit in – and then as you do that research you find out all sorts of other things … that intersect with that story.”
If These Walls Could Talk – Researching the History of Where You Live runs until August, 2024.
Monday to Friday between 9 a.m.
and 4 p.m. City of Toronto Archives, 255 Spadina Rd., free admission.

Full text: In his first remarks to investors as the new head of Bank of Nova Scotia, newly minted chief executive officer Scott Thomson zeroed in on the lender’s beleaguered international business.
The risks of operating in its Latin American markets have outweighed the returns in recent years, and one of his first acts as CEO would be to rejig the international division, he said during a conference call in February.
With the bank gearing up to unveil its strategic turnaround plan in December – less than a year into Mr. Thomson’s tenure – investors expect a spotlight on the division, and analysts say it could exit some countries entirely and reallocate capital to others where it expects significant growth, including booming Mexico.
Constrained by Canada’s highly saturated banking sector, the country’s largest lenders have turned to global markets – largely the United States – in search of greater growth.
But Scotiabank went further afield, hinging its international expansion strategy on Latin America generally, and a group it refers to as the Pacific Alliance: Mexico, Columbia, Peru and Chile.
Mexico – where Scotiabank is a top-five lender in terms of market share and where it generates more than a third of its revenue from Pacific Alliance countries – is considered to be one of the bank’s best growth opportunities.
Speaking to shareholders in recent months, Mr. Thomson has said he plans to target industries that benefit from Mexico’s export agreements – especially with the U.S. – by growing Scotiabank’s commercial banking and wealth management businesses in the country.
“I see the most connectivity with Mexico. And you think about the trade flows between Canada and the U.S., U.S. and Mexico and that whole NAFTA region,” Mr. Thomson said during a conference hosted by Scotiabank in September.
“Is there connectivity between Peru, Chile and Colombia? There’s actually some, around those specific alliance companies. We actually do a lot of business with multi-Latino companies, and there’s an opportunity with multinational companies, but definitely not as much as the Mexico-U.S.-Canada corridor.”
Scotiabank declined to comment for this story in advance of releasing its new strategic plan.
Mr. Thomson has already started culling costs in other areas of the bank, cutting jobs, divesting from stakes in financial services partnerships and letting go of some of its real estate.
The moves come as Canada’s largest lenders broadly face rising expenses, climbing loan loss provisions and mounting regulatory capital requirements, which are putting pressure on profits amid concerns of an economic slowdown.
Operating across Latin America poses logistical challenges. Businesses in the region are disparate, which forces Scotiabank to navigate varying regulations, tax policies and political climates.
Investors expect the strategic plan to demonstrate how the bank will bring its wealth management and commercial and retail banking services together in the countries with the most growth potential, while making some cuts so it can reallocate those resources to other expansion opportunities.
While some of Scotiabank’s Latin America businesses are posting strong profits, others are consistently missing the bar, Barclays analyst John Aiken said.
“The one that sticks out is Colombia. Its profitability has not been nearly as strong as the other three [Pacific Alliance countries], and I think that puts it in the running to be seriously considered for disposal,” he said. Mr. Aiken also pointed to Scotiabank’s operations in the Dominican Republic and some countries in Central America.
Last year, Scotiabank stunned Bay Street by appointing a board member as its new CEO. Mr. Thomson, who joined the board in 2016, made the move into banking from his role as the head of construction equipment dealer Finning International Inc., a major provider of Caterpillar equipment in Latin America, particularly to the copper mining industry in Chile.
His predecessor, Brian Porter, trimmed the lender’s international operations to reduce its exposure to riskier markets and focus on the Pacific Alliance countries where he thought Scotiabank could grow its market share and compete with local rivals.
During his tenure, the bank bought and sold businesses in Latin America to build its wealth management unit and exit higher-risk countries.
Scotiabank’s history in the region stretches back more than a century. It first entered the Caribbean in 1889 when it opened a branch in Kingston, Jamaica. It later expanded into Central and South America when it opened locations in Belize and Argentina in the 1960s – two markets it has since exited.
While the bank has left certain countries, it has added capacity in markets where it thought it could dominate. In 2017, Scotiabank opened four digital innovation hubs in its Pacific Alliance countries, with offices in Colombia, Mexico, Peru and Chile, as well as a fifth in Toronto.
A year later, Scotiabank acquired a large stake in BBVA Chile, doubling its operations in the country and creating the third-largest private bank in Chile.
When Mr. Porter took the reins in 2013, Scotiabank operated in more than 50 countries.
Today, it has businesses in fewer than 30, with a focus on its core four markets in Latin America, which contributed more than a third of Scotiabank’s revenue in the recent quarter. It also still operates in several Caribbean countries, Brazil, Panama, Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic – a group that includes some of the bank’s least profitable markets.
“The prior decisions were probably good risk decisions that have allowed them to retain what would have been additive, but I think you will see further pruning,” Bank of Montreal analyst Sohrab Movahedi said in an interview.
“I wouldn’t expect them to tell us that they are urgently looking to further tighten their footprint in the Pacific Alliance and the Latin American region, but I would expect they’ll give us a sense of what it would look like to get it done over there.”
The lender may also redeploy capital from regions where Scotiabank’s operations are more focused on the higherrisk retail banking segment, including Panama and Costa Rica, to other areas that offer greater commercial banking opportunities, according to Mr. Movahedi.
The bank’s share price has lagged its peers in Canada over the past decade, as inconsistent financial results in its Latin American businesses weighed on sentiment.
“When international has done well, Scotia traded at a premium because it was seen to have a very good outlet for growth, because you can only grow so much in Canada where the market is very saturated,” Keefe, Bruyette & Woods analyst Mike Rizvanovic said in an interview.
“If your growth outlet is not performing well, then that’s a potential headwind for a bank versus its peers.”
Mr. Thomson is looking to reverse that trend. Earlier this year, he launched a bank-wide “refresh” to address investor concerns, and the unveiling will be a defining moment for Mr. Thomson as he looks to turn the corner on his first year at the helm of the bank.
The lender’s first significant leadership change under Mr. Thomson’s watch came in its Latin American division. Ignacio (Nacho) Deschamps, then head of international banking, left the bank in the spring, ushering in new hire Francisco Aristeguieta, who was previously the executive vice-president and CEO of Boston-based bank State Street Corp.’s institutional services unit.
Mr. Aristeguieta is no stranger to international markets. He spent 25 years at New York-based Citigroup Inc., where he led its businesses in the Latin America and Asia Pacific regions.
Scotiabank’s operations in Colombia have struggled the most in the Pacific Alliance in recent years. Its return on equity – a key industry metric that measures profitability – in the third quarter was negative 0.7 per cent, far below Mexico at 25 per cent, Peru at 15 per cent and Chile at 9.7 per cent.
Mr. Thomson said during a conference call in May that the bank is working to “improve the performance of Colombia, recognizing that the current performance is not acceptable.”
Chile and Colombia also booked the largest increases in provisions for credit losses (the funds banks set aside for loans that could default), largely in unsecured retail debt, as the countries’ economies slow.
“We expect key macroeconomic indicators in Chile and Colombia to remain challenged in the near term, owing to a lagged impact of higher interest rates and the loss of purchasing power associated with high inflation,” Scotiabank chief risk officer Phil Thomas said during a call with analysts in August.
But some of the bank’s least profitable international markets are expected to see the most growth next year.
Scotia Economics estimates that in 2024, the Colombian and Chilean economies will grow the fastest of the lender’s major markets.
The challenge of operating in the region is that Latin American markets are vastly different and difficult to predict. Interest rates are significantly higher than Canada in the region, and they swing depending on the decisions of each country’s central bank. While inflation has started to cool and investors expect borrowing costs to decline, heated rates have a long way to fall. In Colombia, Mexico and Chile, central bank rates have climbed to 13.25 per cent, 11.25 per cent and 9 per cent, respectively, towering over Canada’s 5 per cent.
The banking culture in Latin America is also different from Canada’s.
People in some countries tend to distrust the banks, opting instead to keep their money hidden rather than in chequing and savings accounts.
Delinquency rates on loans tend to be high, and are rising as interest rates spike – a trend that has played out at Scotiabank, particularly in Chile and Colombia.
As a result, banking in Latin America is a riskier business than it is in Canada.
Each country has its own political hurdles as well, boosting uncertainty for businesses – and especially a multinational bank. Chile – where the bank inked a $1.3billion deal last year to increase its stake in Scotiabank Chile – is in the throes of rewriting its constitution.
Peru, which has long been referred to as the next country to grow to the scale of Mexico in the region, undergoes frequent government turnover.
Brendan McKenna, international economist at Wells Fargo, said that “Peru becoming the next Mexico has certainly been a topic of discussion for a long time,” but its political instability poses too great of a risk for companies looking to grow there, despite its strong precious metals industry and economy.
“If they can figure out the politics – and that’s a big if – but if they can figure out the politics, Peru could actually become the next Mexico, where fundamentals are really strong, the politics can be somewhat stable, and you don’t see a lot of volatility in financial markets,” Mr. McKenna said in an interview.
“And that could enhance Peru’s growth potential over the longer term.”
But a still-developing banking sector across Latin America means there is ample room to grow.
Scotiabank’s home market in Canada is already highly saturated and competitive, dominated by the Big Six banks. As more people across Latin America adopt digital financial platforms, interest in banking services is growing.
The Pacific Alliance countries are leading Scotiabank’s digital adoption. Digital sales of banking products in its international division have jumped 43 per cent since 2019, compared with a 3.5-per-cent increase in Canada.
“What makes the region compelling is the higher growth, the underbanked relative to higher GDP per capita countries, and also the lack of concentration in the banking systems,” Mr. Aiken said.
“If done successfully, all these make for a very compelling proposition for Scotia.”

Full text: A proposal to significantly change Vancouver’s strategies for its troubled Downtown Eastside to create more housing, more small businesses that serve residents there and a more responsive system of medical care was pitched Wednesday by a councillor from the ruling ABC Vancouver party.
The motion from Rebecca Bligh, which some non-profit community groups are calling “potentially transformational,” lays out a comprehensive approach akin to the Vancouver Agreement in place from 2000 to 2010, when all three levels of government worked to improve the area.
This motion goes beyond that in many ways. It proposes re-examining the 10-year-old plan for the area, a controversial one that restricted development in a wide swath of the neighbourhood to buildings with a 60/40 mix of social housing and market rental.
As well, Ms. Bligh’s motion emphasizes the need to make space in any new buildings in the Downtown Eastside for viable small businesses where residents can get jobs or access low-cost food and goods. And it suggests that new types of medical support are needed, which are less bureaucratic and more able to serve people directly in the hotels and social housing where they are living.
Finally, the second-term councillor suggests that Vancouver adopt a “right of first refusal” for building sales anywhere in the city that would be good sites for social and supportive housing – an approach that Montreal instituted in 2020.
“People in the Downtown Eastside are more unwell than ever.
This is to enable more social and supportive housing but to do that in a way that is … more holistic,” said Ms. Bligh. “The goal is to create communities where people can live, work and shop.
She emphasized that, although her motion asks for staff to look at coming up with a different mix of allowed housing from the current Downtown Eastside plan, it’s not about allowing in private developers.
Instead, it’s to find the right balance of types of rental housing.
She pointed out that only two buildings that fit the current zoning have been constructed in the last decade, leaving low-income people in the area still heavily dependent on the 4,000 remaining rooms in century-old, barely functional residential hotels.
“It’s not to build a new Yaletown,” Ms. Bligh said, referring to a trendy Vancouver neighbourhood. “It’s to bring out the best of the Downtown Eastside.”
Her initiative is a surprisingly ambitious one for an individual councillor – rather than the mayor or a specialized task force – to bring forward. It will be debated at council next Wednesday.
In an unusual turn for Vancouver’s often polarized politics in the Downtown Eastside, her initiative is getting support from some non-profit groups and it generated a lot of positive response elsewhere after it was made public.
“I kind of feel some hope with this,” said Wendy Pedersen, a long-time Downtown Eastside activist who founded and runs SRO Collaborative, an organization focused on improving conditions for tenants in the residential hotels.
Ms. Pedersen is still adamantly opposed to allowing any market condos to be built in the area but said it might be worth going back to the drawing board to figure out what kind of break-even formula would get more social housing built.
She’s more excited by some other aspects of Ms. Bligh’s efforts: the proposal to get the right to make the first offer on properties that would make good socialhousing sites and the efforts to get more money for renovating existing older hotels in the meantime.
Ms. Pedersen said she is seeing a new spirit of collaboration among the political leaders in the three levels of government that are involved in the Downtown Eastside.
And she’s hoping Ms. Bligh’s motion will be able to leverage that collaboration while it exists, before any elections that bring in big changes.
“The three levels we have now are not going to last long. This is the last opportunity to get a big ambitious plan for the Downtown Eastside.” The interim CEO of the Atira Women’s Resource Society, Catherine Roome, is equally enthusiastic about the opening Ms. Bligh’s motion creates.
“Putting people in 110-year-old buildings is dangerous and it’s gotten more insecure. Something has to change.”
That’s why she supports changing the current plan, with its 60/40 ratio, to find something that will actually spur development of new social and supportive housing.
And she’s also encouraged by Ms. Bligh’s focus on creating space for small businesses and needed services in the area.
That is a point echoed by the director of an organization that manages commercial spaces in social-housing buildings, with a goal of creating a mix of private businesses that fit in the community and social enterprises that provide local residents with places to get inexpensive clothing or household goods.
Steven Johnston, executive director of the Community Impact Real Estate Society, said that in previous eras, there was a focus exclusively on housing, which didn’t create the healthiest neighbourhood.
“When we only focus on housing affordability, we’re doing a disservice to the community.
Housing alone won’t provide everything someone needs for a meaningful life.”
He endorsed the idea that Ms. Bligh’s plan, which he called “potentially transformational,” become essentially a Vancouver Agreement 2.0.
“It’s high time. I just hope ABC is up to the task of making this happen and working with community partners.”

Ghost town hopes to see a second life as an energy hub: Once home to 1,200 people before the town was forced to close in 1982 after a molybdenum mining boom went bust, its owner is looking to revive it to become home to an export terminal for LNG or butanol

Full text: In the abandoned mining town of Kitsault, B.C., where time has been suspended for the past 40 years, tourists are no longer welcome to take a journey into nostalgia.
Built in the late 1970s and early 1980s in northwest British Columbia, the remote town once boasted 1,200 residents before the boom went bust for mining molybdenum, an additive used to strengthen steel.
The local mine, which Amax of Canada Ltd. operated for only 18 months, was forced to close in 1982 after molybdenum prices crashed.
The final two residents left Kitsault on Nov. 10, 1983, but remarkably, the place has been preserved by a series of townsite managers and crew.
U.S. millionaire Krishnan Suthanthiran bought Kitsault for about $7-million in 2005.
A limited number of lucky tourists, lured by the chance to experience what life was like in the early 1980s, gained access through a tour operator from 2013 until 2022. This year, after exploring an array of options, Mr. Suthanthiran decided to close the town’s entrance gate to tourists and only allow access to preapproved visitors.
The last truckload of tourists to make the trip down an unpaved road into Kitsault was in September, 2022. Since then, Mr. Suthanthiran has revived his efforts to attract or help create some type of industrial development, which he believes would provide the long-awaited benefits to awaken the town from its slumber.
Kitsault has more than 90 houses and 150 apartment units still in good condition.
Facilities spread across the 130-hectare site include a curling rink, shopping mall, gymnasium and medical clinic.
“Look, I’m one man. For me, I want to preserve the town and create economic activity,” Mr. Suthanthiran said in an interview from Virginia. “This is not for a tourism thing.” He said he is no longer interested in pursuing resort-related options for what to do with Kitsault, including crossing off a movie studio, private retreat, scientific think tank and ecotourism from his wish list.
Now topping his list for ways to breathe new life into the ghost town is one of his ideas from years ago – building an energy export terminal, either for liquefied natural gas (LNG) or for butanol, an alcohol that could be used as a fuel.
Mr. Suthanthiran believes Kitsault, which is situated on the traditional territory of the Nisga’a Nation, is an ideal location to attract investment from the energy industry. “Butanol and LNG are the primary plan A,” he said. “Hydrogen is a possibility.”
While climate activists say the focus in B.C. should be on renewable energy, Mr. Suthanthiran thinks Kitsault could be part of LNG ambitions in the province, given that Nisga’a leaders support LNG exports in general. Specifically, Nisga’a leaders have thrown their support behind plans for the Ksi Lisims LNG project at Wil Milit on Pearse Island, which is about 85 kilometres southwest of Kitsault.
“Ksi Lisims LNG will be the heartbeat of our economy and our best chance at prosperity for our people,” Eva Clayton, elected president of the Nisga’a Lisims government, told the B.C. Environmental Assessment Office this week.
Ten years ago, there were more than 20 proposals in B.C. to export LNG in tankers to markets in Asia. Of those, the Shell PLCled LNG Canada joint venture in Kitimat, B.C., is more than 85-per-cent completed.
But dreams for Canada to become a major LNG player globally have faded. Despite much hype, only four other projects are active in the province.
Mr. Suthanthiran, who said Canada lags far behind the United States on LNG, hopes to rejoin the LNG chase in B.C.
“I need a pipeline to bring the natural gas to Kitsault,” the 75-year-old millionaire said. “There are a lot of things that I’m doing and a lot going on, so I’m not retiring.
This is me, and what we do in our life is a reflection of our character.”
Born in India, he graduated in 1971 with a master’s degree in mechanical engineering from Carleton University in Ottawa. He would later go on to make millions of dollars from real estate investments and to found Virginia-based Best Medical International Inc., a distributor of health products for hospitals.
Mr. Suthanthiran said that after a disagreement, he decided in June to part ways with the caretakers of Kitsault from 2005 to 2022, K.U. Mathew and his wife, Indhu.
The Mathews used to live in Kitsault part of the year, arriving after the snow melted by late May and staying until late October. They have retired in Parksville on Vancouver Island.
“Tourists were amazed at the way Kitsault was preserved and maintained. That was surprising to them after all these years,” said Mr. Mathew, the former townsite manager.
Scenes from Kitsault today make for both a quirky and eerie experience.
Ms. Mathew, the former townsite supervisor, created a museum inside one of the houses to collect many of the mementos under one roof. “We cleaned and tidied up the whole town,” she said. Old issues of Maclean’s magazine linger, including a copy from Nov. 1, 1982, featuring thenprime minister Pierre Trudeau on the cover, with the headline: “A question of trust.”
Also in the museum are curling trophies with bronze spaces meant for engraving the names of winners of annual bonspiels that were planned but never played.
The recreation centre has an empty swimming pool and a hardwood basketball court. A daycare and a library are in the same complex. What are now vintage toys remain in the daycare, free of dust because of cleaning over the decades. The library’s shelves carry books mostly from the 1970s and early 1980s, including separate sections titled Romance, Westerns and Mystery. Robert Ludlum’s 1980 thriller, The Bourne Identity, is still on the shelves awaiting a new reader.
The curling rink has a movie theatre in the basement, with a reel-to-reel film projector.
At the medical clinic, a clear plastic bag one-third full of saline solution hangs from a metal hook above a bed for patients. The bag’s expiry date is January, 1984.
Since 1983, there has been a wide variety of caretaking chores. Those include mowing lawns, keeping moss from creeping up house entrances, vacuuming shag carpeting, ensuring electric baseboard heaters are turned on in the winter and overseeing roof repairs.
Unfortunately, after a contractor inadvertently left his torch on while taking a lunch break from tarring a roof many years ago, one of the apartment buildings burned down.
Mr. Suthanthiran granted access to Kitsault recently to The Globe and Mail to meet Kristine Eva, who took over as townsite manager in early July. She has taken possession of the keys to buildings in the town that time forgot and will be living there year-round.
“I feel like it’s a living museum because it is so well-preserved and it’s like a time capsule,” she said in an interview in her pickup truck. As she pulled into the parking lot for the curling rink, she mentioned a watering hole where residents gathered four decades ago for their final farewells after the mining boom went bust.
The local pub, where a pack of cigarettes cost 70 cents, was built inside the twostorey building that once housed the foursheet curling rink. “We had the last drink in the Maple Leaf Pub,” according to a poster signed by about 60 residents on Oct. 1, 1983.
Ms. Eva first saw the town in the summer of 2022, when she worked for five weeks as one of the caretaking crew.
“I fell in love with it. I knew I had to return,” she said. “It’s just magical to me. I’m driving around this town that people actually lived in 40 years ago and it still looks very similar to what it did back then.”
In each of the past several summers, gold-mining employees from Goliath Resources Ltd. have been sleeping in apartment bedrooms. Mr. Suthanthiran allows in more than 50 Goliath workers who use Kitsault as their base for activities such as setting up tents for core samples from mining in the region. But expanding that rental revenue isn’t a priority for him.
“Goliath wanted to rent space and we have the space. We don’t have a long-term lease and we should review year by year,” he said. “My focus is for a much larger purpose.”
New mattresses have been brought in over the years, but everything else has been largely kept intact inside houses and apartments, as evidenced by colour schemes – such as harvest gold – popular back then.
Larry Payjack recalls a sign that asked the last person to leave Kitsault to please turn out the lights. As it turned out, Mr. Payjack, who owned a sporting goods outlet in the shopping mall, and grocery store manager Reg Piercey were the final residents to leave on Nov. 10, 1983.
Mr. Payjack also worked as a heavy-duty mechanic starting in 1981 at the molybdenum mine opened by Amax of Canada.
Weeks after the mall held its ribbon-cutting ceremonies in April, 1982, Amax told workers that low prices for molybdenum would force the company to suspend operations for one month in late summer that year.
After reopening briefly, Amax announced what was supposed to be another temporary shutdown in November, 1982, which then became a permanent closing.
A hoped-for rebound in prices for the commodity didn’t happen and the mine never reopened.
“I was holding down a full-time job on shift work, plus running the store,” recalls Mr. Payjack, who now lives in Terrace, B.C.
His wife, Cathy, looked after Payjack Sports when his mining schedule conflicted with retail hours.
His Payjack Sports sign remains intact on his former storefront inside the mall. “I didn’t take my sign off because I was hoping maybe to come back if they opened up again,” he said.
John Wheatley worked as a foreman at the area’s first molybdenum mine, starting in 1968 and lasting until the operation closed in 1972.
Mr. Wheatley, who served as Kitsault’s townsite manager from 1986 to 2002, remembers seeing furniture left behind by many of the families who moved away in 1983. He lived year-round with his wife, Patricia, in Kitsault, and they enjoyed the town’s charms.
At what was the local branch of Royal Bank of Canada, there is a notice on the wall alerting customers that the outlet would be closing for good at noon on Oct.
12, 1983.
Mr. Wheatley, who now lives in Terrace, said he felt a sense of civic pride in maintaining Kitsault during his 16 years of caretaking.
The automobile-centric site has driveways and parking lots, but no sidewalks.
“Once winter was done, I would make sure all the roads were washed. I cleared gravel off the roads and made it look good,” he said.
Tour operator Rob Bryce recalls taking small groups of up to a dozen people into Kitsault during past summers. There was a slowdown in the number of tourists in 2020 and 2021 during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, but the excursions regained their popularity in the summer of 2022.
“Lots of people have asked about going in there this year and I just said ‘No, sorry,’ ” Mr. Bryce said.
While the tourism industry and the energy sector are both important drivers of B.C.’s economy, major projects such as those seeking to export LNG are needed to advance the province’s long-term economic prosperity, said Ken Peacock, chief economist at the Business Council of British Columbia.
Time is running out on an LNG export licence that Mr. Suthanthiran received in 2016 through one of his companies, Kitsault Energy Ltd.
The 20-year export licence from the National Energy Board, which is now called the Canada Energy Regulator, is at risk of expiring on Dec. 31, 2024, unless Kitsault Energy starts exporting LNG by that date or obtains a deadline extension.
Adam Tang, who worked at Kitsault Energy from 2013 to 2019, said there is demand in Asia for Canadian LNG, but the challenge is to make the economics work for costly export terminals in British Columbia.
He said Kitsault is a unique asset as a time capsule. If the entrance gate were to be unlocked again to let in tourists, there is “a lot of potential to develop Kitsault into a tourism town,” said Mr. Tang, the former business development co-ordinator at Kitsault Energy.
For Mr. Suthanthiran, who tries to visit Kitsault for a day trip each summer, keeping the ghost town from decaying has cost him between $1-million and $3-million a year, depending on what needs fixing.
He said there remains an excellent opportunity for economic growth, even though it has been more than 18 years since he bought Kitsault from Phelps Dodge Corp., which itself acquired a company that merged with Amax in 1999.
While he acknowledges the sentimental value of Kitsault, he is striving to attain the highest and best use of his asset.
“We don’t want just anybody coming in,” Mr. Suthanthiran said. “I’m a longterm investor. I would say that you will see Kitsault thriving within the next 10 years.”

Full text: 20 Stuart St.
GUELPH , ONT.
Asking Price: $5,150,000 Taxes: $16,604.86 (2023) Lot Size: 0.8 acres Agents: Adam Stewart and Jimmy Molloy, Chestnut Park Real Estate Ltd.
THE BACKSTORY According to local lore in Guelph, Ont., the Reverend Arthur Palmer was known to walk from his front door to the edge of his large property, scramble down the bluff to the Speed River and row his small boat to the other side. From there he’d climb the bank and walk the short distance to his parish at St. George’s Anglican Church.
Rev. Palmer was an Irish immigrant who had established St.
George’s, the first Anglican church in town, in 1832 and served as rector until 1874.
As the city grew, Rev. Palmer purchased approximately 23 acres of land across the river.
The house he had built between 1854 and 1856 had exterior walls of ashlar cut stone. He named the estate Tyrcathlen.
The City of Guelph says the original house was likely designed by William Thomas of Toronto or Frederick J. Rastrick of Hamilton, who were both prominent architects in Upper Canada in the 19th century.
According to notes by the Guelph Arts Council, which included the home on its Slopes of the Speed historical walking tour, the reverend later became an archdeacon. He eventually sold the manse to a local druggist and manufacturer named Alexander Petrie and retired to England in 1875.
In 1925, the insurance executive Henry Higinbotham purchased the house, which had become rundown over time, and undertook an extensive overhaul.
Mr. Higinbotham hired architect H. Reginald Coales for the transformation, which included expanding the building. The front entrance, which faced the river during Rev. Palmer’s time, was moved to the opposite side to face Stuart Street.
Mr. Higinbotham tore down some of the outbuildings and built a new coach house, which contained the heating system.
Heat was funnelled to the main house through an underground tunnel. That way, if there was a fire or explosion in the furnace room, the main house would be protected from the inferno.
He renamed the estate Ker Cavan.
Following the Higinbotham family’s tenure, retired BrigadierGeneral Kenneth Torrance purchased the mansion for his summer home in the 1950s.
In 1960, Ker Cavan became a nursing home and rest home, with part of the building serving as the family home of the proprietors.
In the 1980s, a builder purchased the property and subdivided the land for residential development. The house was split in two.
The controversial redevelopment drew the scrutiny of Guelph’s heritage conservationists.
The city moved to designate 20 Stuart St. a heritage property in 1986, noting the building is one of the few surviving examples in Canada of the Tudor type of the Gothic revival style.
In 2008, Guelph resident Peregrine Wood was driving her son to soccer practice when she was diverted by construction. The detour took her past 20 Stuart St.
where a “For Sale” sign had just been planted on the lawn.
A few years earlier, Ms. Wood and her husband, Kirk Roberts, had narrowly missed purchasing one-half of the divided house.
They both agreed if the other half ever came up for sale, they would buy it.
Ms. Wood called the agent but she insisted that the home wasn’t ready for showings yet.
Ms. Wood and Mr. Roberts enlisted the help of a friend who lived close to the historic house to introduce them to the owners, who were frantically prepping the property before the photographer arrived the following day.
“By midnight the deal was done,” says Ms. Wood.
THE HOUSE TODAY The couple moved from a stone house they had restored together at the north end of town to Stuart Street with their two children.
The couple’s son and daughter were entering their teenage years, Ms. Wood says, and the new location allowed them to walk to activities and entertainment in downtown Guelph.
In 2009, the couple began the renovation, which turned out to be far more complex than any project they had undertaken before.
“We ended up firing our general contractor after six weeks,” says Mr. Roberts.
The couple had travelled extensively in Europe and they envisioned a home that retained all of the existing heritage details while juxtaposing the old with the new.
The contractor held the view that all of the elements should look as if they had always been there, Mr. Roberts explains.
With such clashing visions, Ms. Wood took over as general contractor.
The main goal was to remove all of the 1980s-era fixtures, says Mr. Roberts, while restoring everything else.
Plumbing, electrical and heating and cooling systems needed to be updated, and water damage in some areas repaired.
Over the years, the elaborate plaster moulding and ceiling medallions in the principal rooms had cracked, leading to some shoddy repair work.
The 19th-century ears of maize, Tudor roses and classical rosettes are now protected under heritage preservation rules.
Ms. Wood says her husband barred her from entering the library for months while the plaster restorer dug deep into the plaster to find the source of the problem and repair it.
“I don’t think I could have handled the stress,” she says with a laugh.
Some of the other heritagedesignated interior details were in remarkably good shape, say the couple, pointing to the wooden staircase in the main hall and the built-in mahogany bookshelf that lines one wall of the library.
Doorways with Gothic arches and the leaded and stained glass windows have also been preserved throughout the house, along with wooden shutters inside the oriel windows.
Rev. Palmer’s wooden porch had long been replaced with a conservatory, say the couple, and that space had in turn become the kitchen.
The window frames were completely shot, Ms. Wood says, so the couple had the three walls of windows replaced.
A dropped ceiling was also removed to expose some wood beams. Ms. Wood brought in workers to sandblast the beams and clean up the surfaces.
“Carpenter ants just started dropping,” she says.
Those beams were hastily hauled away and another even higher ceiling was uncovered.
Once the challenges had been tackled, the couple had a new kitchen installed with built-in appliances, a large island and modern glass-fronted cabinets.
“We wanted to create something that didn’t compete with the architecture,” Ms. Wood says.
“It is calm and serene.”
A former parlour in the house is now the dining room.
Upstairs, the primary suite included a 1980s-era ensuite bathroom with carpeting and a huge jacuzzi tub.
“It was very loud and ornate,” says Ms. Wood.
The couple gutted the room and added cool grey floor tiles, a walk-in shower, a floating vanity and a soaker tub hoisted to the second level by crane.
“The bathroom was just an organic process,” says Ms. Wood.
“We chose clear and simple and modern in spaces where there weren’t any existing architectural features.”
For their son’s room, the couple exposed the limestone wall and renovated the bathroom.
The third floor, which was originally an attic, became their daughter’s haven, with a bedroom, a bathroom with original tub and a large space for lounging and sleepovers.
The lower level became another place for teenagers to hang out, with media and recreation rooms and a separate entrance.
French doors lead to an outdoor terrace.
Just as some interior elements are protected by heritage conservation rules, so are the towering spruce trees that stand in front of the house. The couple also planted Japanese maple, hemlock, ironwood, pagoda dogwood and purple leaf birch trees to create a park-like setting.
“We’ve always considered ourselves custodians,” says Ms. Wood. “This house is so much part of the community.”
THE BEST FEATURE The main hall contains some of the home’s most significant heritage-designated elements, including a grand staircase in Honduran mahogany and a ninepanel stained glass window depicting the motto of Mr. Higinbotham’s military regiment.

Full text: As the federal government pushes cities to build the new homes needed to address the country’s housing shortage, municipal politicians are finding themselves in a financial conundrum: Even though the housing crisis is a national problem, many of the costs of solving it are entirely local.
Cities are responsible for building the roads, sewers and other infrastructure necessities that new housing construction depends upon. In the absence of long-term, reliable funding to meet the federal demands, local councils across the country have been left to pursue their own strategies.
A tussle in Metro Vancouver, the only place where local politicians have publicly defied Ottawa, is being watched closely by other cities and towns.
In late October, Metro Vancouver’s regional board of directors voted to begin charging real estate developers for 99 per cent of the costs of infrastructure for new housing, with some exceptions for affordable homes. The move is expected to triple the municipal fees, known as developer cost charges, that builders pay on each new unit of housing. Critics say those costs could be passed on to buyers, potentially making homes even less affordable in one of Canada’s least affordable cities.
Federal Housing Minister Sean Fraser had asked the district’s board to delay its phase-in of the fees for a year, and to consider waiving fees on a broader range of lower-cost housing. The minister is now threatening to withhold from Vancouver tens of millions of dollars from Ottawa’s relatively new Housing Accelerator Fund, which provides money to local governments for housing initiatives.
Other cities face similar pressures, but are pursuing different solutions. In Calgary, city staff estimate the population increased by about 3 per cent – or roughly 40,000 people – between April, 2022, and the same month this year.
The city has said this would be the largest one-year jump on record. Politicians and planners expect an increase of at least 108,000 more in the next four years.
The city is planning to house 60,000 residents in four new developments on its northern edge.
It’s the kind of increase in housing supply that Mr. Fraser and others have been asking for.
But that supply comes with a gigantic infrastructure bill. In response to a request from The Globe and Mail, the city for the first time provided a detailed breakdown of what it would need to spend: from $315-million to $375-million for water, waste water and storm water systems; $35-million to $50-million for road interchanges; $15-million to $20-million for pedestrian overpasses; $20-million for a new fire hall; and $150-million over the years for parks, public transit, community centres and libraries.
For now, Calgary has chosen to stick with its existing formula for paying those bills. The city’s taxpayers fund 50 per cent of the cost of new growth, and fees charged to housing developers cover the other 50 per cent.
That’s the same formula Metro Vancouver used until last month.
The thinking is that existing residents also benefit from many of the new amenities.
For local politicians throughout Canada, finding ways to pay for growth can be like trying to solve a city-sized Rubik’s Cube.
Cities have less ability to levy taxes than higher orders of government, and must often turn to other means.
“People don’t just live in a building. They live in a community,” Halifax Mayor Mike Savage said. But coming up with the money to build a whole community is not easy.
Cities, he said, “control 60 per cent of the infrastructure in the whole country but we collect only 10 per cent of the tax revenue.”
“We need some kind of funding structure to pay for the growth.”
Mayors and councils have typically faced a choice: Raise taxes for everyone, or charge big fees to the developers that build new housing. The latter has been preferred by many local politicians for decades. The underlying principle is that growth should pay for growth.
That was the thinking behind Metro Vancouver’s decision.
The district’s senior staff had calculated that the Lower Mainland was going to need $35-billion in new basic infrastructure (sewer, water, parks and liquid and solid waste services) in the next 30 years. Of that, they found that $11.5-billion would be related to the million extra people expected to arrive during that time.
The rest of the expense would be needed to serve existing residents.
Last year, those staffers recommended some tax increases for existing residents – up to 11 and 12 per cent annually in future years – but also called for an increase to developer fees so that they would cover 99 per cent of the basic infrastructure costs attributable to growth. The change was expected to add as much as $15,000 in new charges on each new house or apartment in the region by the end of a three-year phase-in.
Half of the region’s politicians voted in favour of that plan, enough for it to pass, in spite of the threat from Mr. Fraser to withhold funding. Many of them have said the federal government should be putting money into needed infrastructure, instead of berating local politicians because they can’t find ways to pay those bills.
Some local politicians have pointed out that housing shortages are at least partly of the federal government’s own making.
Ottawa has increased its immigration targets in recent years, and is now planning to admit 500,000 new permanent residents a year starting in 2025.
Those numbers do not include the hundreds of thousands of temporary residents in the country for study or work.
“I’m not hearing solutions. I’m not hearing about any funding from the federal government based on immigration targets.
I’m not hearing a lot of things,” said Eric Woodward, mayor of Langley township, which forms part of Metro Vancouver. Brad West, mayor of Port Coquitlam, called the federal government’s demands “akin to a hostage-taking.”
While mayors and councillors elsewhere have been more restrained in their criticisms, they also are increasingly saying that Ottawa needs a more coherent, less erratic system for funding necessary infrastructure in cities.
A focus this year for the Federation of Canadian Municipalities, which represents city governments around the country, is on securing a steady and increased funding stream from Ottawa – perhaps one based on population growth.
The federal government initiated a $180-billion, 12-year infrastructure fund in 2018. But many mayors say it functions like a lottery, and isn’t useful for figuring out how to pay for billion-dollar projects on 30-year timelines.
In Metro Vancouver, many projects have been deemed too large to qualify for money from the fund. In Calgary, planners say some federal grant money might be available for the city’s big new subdivisions. But they’re not counting on it, nor are many other cities, whose staff have complained of endless complications.
Their projects are too big, or not big enough, or they don’t qualify for unknown reasons. In some cases, cities don’t have the staff resources to keep up with complex, never-ending rounds of applications.
“We’re asking for some changes,” Scott Pearce said. He is the president of the Federation of Canadian Municipalities, and also the mayor of Gore, Que. His small town in the Laurentians, north of Montreal, has seen its population increase about 20 per cent from what it was before the pandemic. As a result, his council has been forced to think about adding new services.
No one is happy about having to raise taxes or development charges, he said. “We’re forced to do this. We don’t want it, but we don’t have the money to do what we need to do.”
In Ontario, Innisfil Mayor Lynn Dollin is dealing with the same conundrum. The population in her town of 45,000 has grown by almost 20 per cent since 2016. Local politicians and planners believe it is on its way to 300,000.
“We know what’s coming,” Ms. Dollin said. “We have plans in place, but the dollars to get there are significant. It’s not just water, sewer, transit. It’s hockey rinks, it’s libraries.”
Ontario’s government recently passed legislation that it has said will make “attainable” housing – a term the province has not precisely defined – exempt from development charges. The policy could leave towns like Ms. Dollin’s with even less money to provide services.
In Halifax, Mr. Savage’s council recently voted on several new initiatives intended to make room for more housing in the city. Those included allowing four homes on every residential lot. The move goes partway to meeting the federal Housing Minister’s requirements for the city to receive $79-million from the accelerator fund.
In B.C., Metro Vancouver’s chief administrative officer, Jerry Dobrovolny, has been arguing that the region’s proposed fee increases on developers are not the biggest drivers of unaffordability.
The real problems are interest rates, land prices and building material costs, he has said.
He has also said that research shows development fees don’t increase the cost of housing, because developers can sell homes only for whatever the market will pay.
So far, Mr. Fraser is not backing down.
In a statement he sent out immediately after Metro Vancouver’s vote on development fees, he said he is going to talk to the province about whether the proceeds are really being used to pay for growth, “rather than to address existing fiscal challenges.”

Nathan Fielder and Emma Stone turn The Curse into a dark blessing: The series introduces married real estate developers who film a home-improvement reality show for HGTV called Flipanthropy

Full text: The Curse Created by Nathan Fielder and Benny Safdie Starring Emma Stone, Nathan Fielder and Benny Safdie CRITIC’ S PICK Is there a more dangerous place to be than inside the mind of Nathan Fielder? The Canadian comedian, who got his start on CBC’s This Hour Has 22 Minutes, has in relatively short order become the most provocative and diabolical voice in American television since Sacha Baron Cohen. With his Comedy Central docuseries, Nathan for You, and last year’s HBO sensation The Rehearsal – the latter a brilliant send-up of reality-TV self-help culture that culminated in an ethically dubious twist – Fielder has twisted the idea of reality and fiction, identity and imagination. And all while being side-splittingly funny in a deadpan manner that’s almost sinister.
And now with his new series, The Curse, Fielder is embracing the world of scripted comedy with a stranglehold so intense and determined that the form just about passes out cold.
Co-created by and co-starring Benny Safdie (who with his brother Josh pioneered a new kind of ultra-scuzzy New York cinema as the directors of Good Time and Uncut Gems), The Curse is the most exciting, innovative and delightfully uncomfortable series of the year. And just like the massive undertaking that was The Rehearsal – in which Fielder built fabulously detailed sets and hired legions of professional actors to “help” ordinary people rehearse difficult conversations or upcoming life events – The Curse is a hall-of-mirrors experience that is as haunting as it is hilarious.
The 10-episode series opens by introducing viewers to a fictionalized version of the New Mexico town of Espanola, where married real estate developers Asher (Fielder) and Whitney (Emma Stone) have set up shop to film a new home-improvement reality show for HGTV called Flipanthropy. Pushing environmentally responsible housing – with mirrorplated homes that offset their own carbon output – the couple are hoping to rejuvenate the economically depressed town and save the world in the process.
But as the series progresses, it becomes clear that both Asher and Whitney are using the sizzle of a TV series to wrestle with their own private motives – deep, gnawing moral quandaries that start to bubble to the surface once Flipanthropy’s coarse producer, Dougie (Safdie), begins to needle the couple in order to achieve a more titillating kind of reality television.
Whitney, for instance, projects the air of an ultra-progressive ally to the working-class, mostly Indigenous people of Espanola, tossing off such lines of dialogue as “I’m so grateful for your stewardship.” Yet she’s also making Flipanthropy to run away from the shadow of her wealthy parents, notorious slumlords who couldn’t care less about their community. Asher, meanwhile, is a tightly coiled bundle of neuroses, much of them fuelled by a certain bodily condition that might represent an X-rated first for small-screen depiction.
And then there’s that curse of the title, a sly bit of surreal magic that is slipped into the show after Asher has an awkward encounter with a young local girl who places a hex on him because of a good deed gone awry.
Are Asher and Whit’s many problems – both of the professional and marital variety – merely the kind of everyday challenges that any working couple face when trying to build something from scratch? Or are they the result of something larger and more cosmic?
That fuzzy line between what is real and what is manufactured divides the dark heart of The Curse. Fielder and Safdie delight in the itchy, nerve-racking comedy that can come from exploring such ambiguity. Even the way the show is shot – many episodes are directed by Fielder himself – blurs the line between scripted and unscripted storytelling.
When the HGTV cameras aren’t trained on Asher and Whitney, it seems that we’re watching their lives caught by some other, more hidden camera crew – all high, odd angles and peek-a-boo staging that erase the notion of privacy.
And while the supporting cast is mostly filled out by recognizable faces – including Corbin Bernsen as Whitney’s father, and Captain Phillips scene-stealer Barkhad Abdi as the father of the girl who curses Asher – several of the Espanola locals appear to be, from their mannerisms and halting line deliveries, real-deal community members roped into the show by methods unknown.
Fielder, who projected a bizarrely charming kind of anti-charisma as “host” of Nathan for You and The Rehearsal, digs into some deep, dirty corners to play Asher.
There is one sex scene between him and Whitney that is so raw and eye-opening that Fielder challenges himself to find a new level of emasculation never before put on screen. And Stone is, as always, flawless. Playing the self-deluding Whitney as both a victim and a tool of the capitalist machine she professes to be raging against, the actress sinks into a profoundly complicated character.
Like all of Fielder’s productions, there is an almost cruel menace at work in The Curse. But that threat is as much a carrot as it is a stick. Each hour-long episode is a meticulously engineered experiment designed to see how tense a situation can get until audiences are provoked to unrestrained hysterics. It is easy to lose count of just how many times the show transforms a moment of shock into one of laughout-loud yelping. A curse that turns into a blessing.
The Curse is streaming now on Paramount+, with new episodes added weekly.

Full text: Twenty-four-year-old artillery captain Arthur Britton Smith, a tall, lean professional soldier with a jaunty Rhett Butler mustache, landed at Normandy in July, 1944, a month after D-Day. He had trained for four years but his war was a short one.
Just three weeks after arriving in France, Capt. Smith was headed back across the English Channel on a stretcher, one of 1,500 Canadian casualties from a futile single-day assault on Verrières Ridge.
The dashing young war hero survived his wounds and over the next eight decades built one of the country’s largest apartment rental companies and shared his millions with dozens of local charities and institutions.
Brit, as he was best known, died peacefully on Oct. 28 at age 103.
Arthur Britton Smith was born in Kingston on May 10, 1920, to Cyril and Edna Smith. Although his father was a lawyer, he had the army on his mind and launched his military career on his 15th birthday by joining the city’s 32nd Field Battery, an artillery militia unit. “The next day,” Mr. Smith recounted to Kingston’s Profile Magazine in 2007, “I was wearing spurs and britches. … I was a boy soldier.”
On the advice of his officers, he enrolled in the Royal Military College (just across the Cataraqui River from his home), graduating in 1940, less than a year after the outbreak of war in Europe. By August, he was in England with the Royal Canadian Artillery.
When he finally reached France on July 7, 1944, Capt.
Smith was a troop commander in the 4th Field Regiment in charge of four 25-pounder gun crews. The D-Day troops who had landed on Juno Beach had fought for a month but only advanced 22 torturous kilometres from the coast; the Normandy countryside was a smouldering ruin by the time Capt. Smith rode his lightly armoured Bren gun carrier to the front line.
On July 20, Capt. Smith went into action with a company of Les Fusiliers Mont-Royal as a forward observation officer (FOO), a dangerous battle assignment that attracted close attention from German snipers eager to end the deadly accurate fire of the Allies’ howitzers.
Moving slowly with Les Fusiliers Mont-Royal toward entrenched SS troops, Capt. Smith disguised himself as an infantry rifleman, hiding his powerful binoculars and maps inside his uniform and covering his officer shoulder pips with a camouflage scarf. He carried a rifle to complete the deception.
During a difficult two-kilometre advance to Troteval Farm, Capt. Smith directed a creeping barrage that delivered a moving curtain of explosives ahead of Les Fusiliers Mont-Royal to destroy enemy positions. Once the farm had been captured, he divided his time between identifying targets and co-ordinating defence of the old stone farmyard until he was slightly injured by a small grenade. Pursuing his attacker through an opening in a stone wall, he was hit by a burst of machine-gun fire.
Writing in the academic journal Canadian Military History 60 years later, he recalled, “I felt like I had been kicked in the gut, but there was no blood.” The clunky plastic body armour he was wearing had absorbed the bullets’ impact.
The following day, Troteval Farm withstood five attacks as the Germans tried to recapture it with infantry, armour and artillery. Capt. Smith directed fire on them with his battery’s 24 guns, each one firing up to 600 shells that day. When he wasn’t on the radio, he fought off the enemy with a rifle. Finally, with only 17 defenders left fighting, the company’s commander decided to surrender, authorizing Capt.
Smith to call for one more barrage on their own location as Germans entered the farmyard.
Machine guns raked Capt.
Smith’s carrier as he and his radio operators raced back to their own regiment less than a kilometre away. He was later awarded the Military Cross for “his coolness and bravery under heavy fire as well as his complete disregard for his own safety.”
Capt. Smith’s luck ran out four days later when his vehicle hit an anti-tank mine. Crawling away from the wreck, he was shot in the head but was rescued before bleeding to death.
After a brief convalescence, Capt. Smith returned to Kingston to great fanfare and married Sally Carruthers. By 1948, he was practising law in Kingston and dabbling in real estate.
He constructed his first apartment building – an eight-unit low-rise on a $1,000 lot at the edge of the city – while still a student at Osgoode Hall, hiring a Kingston neighbour to build it, and travelling home on weekends to oversee progress.
Mr. Smith continued his Kingston real-estate pursuits as a sideline to his law practice and averaged a new apartment building a year, looking in on construction sites on his way to his law office. In 1954, he incorporated his real-estate business as Homestead Land Holdings Ltd.
and raised his ambitions. Today, the company owns 26,000 apartment units in 16 Ontario cities (and a single high-rise in Calgary). While billing itself as Ontario’s largest landlord, Homestead remains focused primarily on Kingston, where it has 44 buildings.
While Homestead is generally well regarded by individual tenants, its high-profile projects have regularly met fierce opposition from community groups.
The company has faced long fights – and occasional defeats – over several proposed developments in prime locations along Kingston’s waterfront and in historical neighbourhoods.
City councillor Conny Glenn, chair of Kingston’s two heritage committees, notes that Mr. Smith’s position – “one foot in the past and one foot in the future” – was complex. “Despite the conflicts,” she says, “He was appreciative of heritage. … It wasn’t a perfect situation, but he had good intent.”
While Homestead’s executives shun publicity, Mr. Smith provided a friendly face, mingling easily with the city’s establishment families, charities and public institutions like Queen’s University and the Kingston General Hospital.
Kingston Profile magazine publisher Bonnie Golomb, a lifelong resident of the city, marvels that Mr. Smith kept his hometown the focus of his life. “He could have lived anywhere but he stayed in Kingston. He was very social but humble and selfdeprecating. … He always said Homestead was his hobby.”
Indeed, Mr. Smith had many other interests beside law and real estate. After the war, he joined the local Prince of Wales Own Regiment, an infantry militia unit, eventually becoming its honorary commanding officer. He also served three terms on city council in the 1950s.
As his personal wealth grew, he invested money as well as time into his local interests.
When new road construction blocked access to a Memorial archway, he shouldered much of the cost to relocate it – using his own construction crews to rebuild its limestone walls.
“Brit was a very active supporter of RMC,” recalls the school’s former commandant, Commodore (retired) Ed Murray.
“He appreciated tradition.” Several years ago, Mr. Smith purchased 1,400 white pith helmets to be worn by cadets with their scarlet tunics, reviving a longtime tradition that the government refused to fund.
His other donations were less esoteric. Through his foundation, Mr. Smith gifted millions of dollars to Queen’s University’s medical and nursing schools, St. Lawrence College, the United Way, and Kingston hospitals. Frustrated by the city’s failure to secure a permanent home for the Marine Museum of the Great Lakes, in 2019 he funded the purchase of its original lakefront facility from a rival developer for $3.2-million.
In 2022, the Smith-Homestead Foundation donated $1-million to Home Base Housing, a charity for disadvantaged youth.
On his 100th birthday, a year after he was named to the Order of Canada in 2019, Mr. Smith playfully talked about his money with the Kingston Whig-Standard. “What else can I do with it?” he asked. “When you get to my age, it’s hard to figure out a way to spend money. I’m too old for most things.”
Predeceased by Sally, his wife of 68 years, and his son Britton, Mr. Smith leaves two sisters; his son Alexander; daughter, Sheila; their children; and his partner, Margaret Daicar.

Full text: 29 Swanwick Ave.
TORONTO Asking Price: $1,574,000 Taxes: $6,902.60 (2023) Lot Size: 19.5 by 150.28 feet Listing agent: Jason Walker, Royal LePage Signature Realty THE BACKSTORY House hunting can be a slog of must-haves and red flags, of balancing potential versus weighing downsides. And sometimes it’s as simple as whether the local park is dog friendly.
That’s what happened to Kyra and Sarah Gerber in 2003 when they stopped to look at 29 Swanwick Ave. in Toronto on the recommendation of Kyra’s father, who is a realtor.
“We were fairly new, married but three years in, and we weren’t really in the market yet,” said Dr.
Kyra Gerber, who is a chiropractor. “Off we went to the open house and we showed up a halfhour early, so we started walking around the neighbourhood. We walked into Norwood Park, and there’s a fenced off area: ‘Is that a dog park? If that’s a dog park we’re going to buy this house.’” Sure enough, it was. And sure enough they did – with a little financial help from family. The next 20 years were about making it their forever home; doing major retrofits to all three levels while working together at their clinic where Sarah is the director of operations. “It makes carpooling easy,” Dr. Gerber said.
The changes make for an indoor and outdoor oasis with the entire second floor serving as an extended primary suite and the basement level serving as half home gym and half guest suite.
The only reason they are looking to sell is the beckoning call of the wild. It all began a few months ago when they travelled to Vancouver Island to visit family and spent many hours in nature on outdoor activities.
“I’m from there, and it was like a switch that flicked in me: if I had a chance to move back there I would,” said Sarah. The discussion of what that would look like sparked a compromise: if they don’t want to leave Ontario yet, what about moving to a lake here?
“It just opened the door to possibilities,” said Dr. Gerber. “It was definitely a bittersweet decision, but this home will be the right fit for somebody else now.”
THE HOUSE TODAY This neighbourhood is called the Upper Beaches, a stretch of similar-era houses that run north/ south between Kingston Road and Danforth Avenue.
The crimson-coloured front door opens into a small foyer and front sitting room. There’s a TV mounted here above a gas fireplace.
The stairs to the second level climb up on the left, but straight ahead is a dining room, with a huge tempered glass table, between the living room and kitchen.
“Both of us are very interested in nutrition, food and entertaining, and prerenovation it was a functional kitchen. But Kyra is quite a bit taller than me, so I was ducking when we worked in there,” said Sarah.
The mission of making the space more efficient and also clutter-free is accomplished by adding a large central island with a light-grey quartz top, flanked by pantry storage and counters on both walls.
There’s even what the couple call a “kitchen garage” – a place for all those appliances you need occasionally but not constantly: “You open these two massive doors, with shelving and drawer space, so all the extra small appliances have a place to get tucked away.”
Steps down from the kitchen is a sun-roofed solarium Dr. Gerber uses as an office with a large closet for outdoor gear. It could be converted into a main-floor powder room.
The backyard has been landscaped with a mix of interlocking brick and stone with a carport/ kayak storage structure providing shade.
There is mutual driveway from the street, but new fencing makes it so narrow that it would be difficult to get more than a motorcycle to the backyard. The yard backs onto land for the Calvary Baptist Church, and a shaded seating area and firepit behind the carport offers that rare slice of seclusion that can still be found in urban Toronto.
Down the stairs and off the solarium is a level that had been an income-producing apartment but is now extended living space with a mirror-wall home gym (complete with boxing speedbag) and TV area.
There’s a guest bedroom here, and a three-piece bathroom with a large bench in the glass-enclosed shower (perfect for relaxing under the water or dog washing.
THE UPSTAIRS OASIS The entire second floor is opened up like a loft apartment, with a tempered glass wall and door at the top of the stairs.
The couple added a balcony off the bedroom so they could sit in the rear yard’s tree canopy. The front of this level was rebuilt as a massive bathroom/dressing room.
One might have privacy concerns about the soaker tub and separate shower that stand in front of the large street-facing window, but a little innovation solves the issue. There’s a motorized and programmable blind that comes down across the whole window at night.
“When you’re taking a tub in the daytime we can have that blind up and not be seen,” said Dr.
Gerber. “When it’s lighter outside all you get is reflection.”
“We tested it a lot, trust me,” said Sarah.

Calgary banking on big downtown development: For the city’s new arena district, success will ultimately depend on how many people want to live there

Full text: For more than seven decades, the east end of Calgary’s Beltline, also known as East Victoria Park, has been waiting for its renaissance. Building a new arena for the Calgary Flames could do just that, at least on paper.
On Oct. 5, the city council finalized the city’s agreement to move forward with the construction of a new arena, replacing the 40-year-old Saddledome.
With an expected cost of $1.2billion, this development has brought renewed hope and a reason to believe that the latest vision for East Victoria Park, now rebranded as Calgary’s Culture and Entertainment District, is one step closer to its realization.
Bounded by the Elbow River, Stampede Park, and the CP and LRT tracks, the Culture and Entertainment District is home to the Saddledome and BMO Centre. But despite the growing number of visitors this area receives each year, efforts to revitalize it have been slow to materialize.
The latest attempt to redevelop the area launched in 2018, when Calgary Municipal Land Corporation (CMLC), a wholly owned subsidiary of the City of Calgary, unveiled the Rivers District Master Plan, a detailed road map of how the Culture and Entertainment District’s 286 acres should evolve to accommodate 8,000 residents and three million visitors in a dense, mixed-use neighbourhood.
“The ambition of this masterplanned area was to look at how we can really catalyze new development in the area to see the build-out of underutilized land,” says Kate Thompson, president and CEO of CMLC. “As we saw in East Village, the public investment being made in the area attracts the attention of private industry … so in [East] Victoria Park we’re taking the same approach.”
For Ms. Thompson, the expected completion of three milestone projects in 2024, including the BMO Centre expansion, 17th Avenue extension, and the Victoria Park/Stampede C-train station rebuild, compounded with the construction of a new arena, is key to the success of the Culture and Entertainment District.
“We’re seeing interest piqued now that major projects are under way, and it’s giving investors and developers confidence that they need to look into the area again,” Ms. Thompson says. “Developers crave certainty, and that’s basically the biggest success of the addition of the arena moving forward. It provides certainty for developers across Canada.” Indeed, according to Ray Wong, vice-president of data operations at Altus Group, public investment on large projects such as the new arena and the convention centre, alongside upgrades to complementary infrastructure, boost Calgary’s attractiveness – as well as property values.
“In theory, if you reinvigorate a certain area, and generate increased demand for a location, there’s spillover effects for neighbouring properties and values,” he says, pointing at the effects Rogers Place has had on Edmonton’s Ice District. “They’ve definitely improved that area with respect to increased retail and residential, but I think it’s taking a little bit more time than they had anticipated.”
Despite the initial hype created by Rogers Place, and $4.7-billion invested in redeveloping Edmonton’s downtown, the area is suffering from the same woes as any other city in North America, including Calgary.
As office and retail vacancies in downtown Edmonton remain elevated, the value of commercial buildings in the city’s core is dropping.
Since the completion of the Edmonton Oilers’ arena in 2016, the assessed value of commercial properties has decreased by nearly 40 per cent, according to the city’s latest tax assessment.
This situation is delaying the construction of commercial projects in the area. Recently, Ice District Properties paused the development of a 16-storey office tower in downtown Edmonton.
Such an outcome, however, shouldn’t be unexpected. Evidence shows that the economic benefits of new sports venues have more limits than boosters claim.
“What we see is that there is really very little in the form of job growth and income creation,” says Dennis Coates, an economics professor at the University of Maryland, about new arenas. But politicians perceive this to be a better outcome than the prospect of losing their city’s team.
For this reason, cities across North America fund new arenas based on “the claim that there are benefits that occur as a consequence of having a professional sports team, and the implied threat of a team leaving.”
However, there is one promise new sports venues in central locations seem more likely to deliver: a rise in the value of residential properties located within five kilometres of the facility – and downtown Edmonton is no exception.
Burgeoning redevelopment between 2016 and 2023 has caused the assessed value of residential properties in the area to increase by more than 10 per cent, despite a dwindling population.
Over the past seven years, more than 1,525 apartments have been built in the area, and there are 1,471 more currently under construction across four projects, including Pangman’s The Parks and Qualico’s Station Lands.
While Calgary’s new arena could have a similar effect on the Culture and Entertainment District and accelerate redevelopment, the future of this area will be ultimately determined by the number of people willing to live there full-time.
To ensure the spillover effects of Calgary’s new arena materialize, investment in complementary amenities that serve fulltime residents, not just visitors, is essential, says Mr. Wong of Altus Group. “Ideally, you want people to live there year-round, rather than transitory people, and Airbnb and so on.”
The City of Calgary’s contribution to the arena deal includes the construction of car and pedestrian infrastructure to improve the connection between the new facility to its surroundings, as well as new and upgraded utilities. Public realm improvements brought forward by the Rivers District Master Plan, such as the second phase of the RiverWalk and 12th Avenue Promenade, are yet to be funded.
Kamil Lalji, a local realtor and investor, is brokering one of the three parcels currently listed in the vicinity of the Culture and Entertainment District. a 7,003square-foot site on 14th Ave, zoned for a multifamily high-rise – and he is bullish about the area’s future.
“One of the main principles of real estate development is buying and developing land in the path of other bigger developments,” he says.
But until further improvements to the area are realized, Mr. Lalji believes developers are more likely to buy and hold land than redevelop it. “It’s kind of wait until everything is done, and then really capitalize on the increase in value.”

Full text: INVESTOR CLINIC In the October issue of ROB Magazine, I read that Royal Bank of Canada’s profit 40 years ago “was an almost quaint $480-million; in 2022, it was $15.8-billion.” I’m curious to know: If a young person had purchased shares back then and reinvested the dividends, what would the total value of the investment be today? Assuming this was their retirement plan, would the investment have kept up with inflation?
I’m always pounding the table about the importance of investing for the long-term, so I’m happy to answer this question. I think you’ll find the results quite impressive. Given the turmoil in markets lately, the numbers might even give you some comfort.
The following analysis is based on data from Bloomberg.
Let’s step into our time machine and assume an investor purchased 1,000 shares of Royal Bank (RY) on Dec. 30, 1983.
The price at the time was $34.38 a share, so that’s a total investment of $34,380. True, that was a rather large chunk of change – a brand new Hyundai Pony retailed for about $6,000 at the time – but we’ll assume the investor didn’t put another dime into Royal Bank stock apart from reinvesting dividends every quarter.
Before we continue, it’s important to note that Royal Bank’s stock has split on a two-for-one basis three times since then – in 1990, 2000 and 2006. Because each split would have doubled the number of shares, the investor would have 8,000 shares today, even without reinvesting any dividends.
Fast-forward nearly 40 years, to Sept. 29, 2023. Royal Bank’s shares closed that day at $118.70. So, based on capital growth alone, excluding dividends, the initial investment of $34,380 would have grown to $949,600 (8,000 shares times $118.70).
That works out to a return of about 2,662 per cent, or 8.7 per cent on a compound annual basis.
Pretty impressive, right? Now, let’s add the secret sauce: dividends.
Assuming all dividends were reinvested in additional Royal Bank shares, the initial investment would have grown at a compound annual rate of slightly more than 13 per cent. Today, it would be worth … wait for it … more than $4.5-million.
A few caveats are in order. First, the results are before income taxes, which would apply to dividends and capital gains in a non-registered account. Second, the numbers aren’t adjusted for inflation, which averaged about 2.48 per cent over the period, according to the Bank of Canada. But that’s a pittance next to the stock’s annualized return. Third, the vast majority of people probably aren’t going to hang on to a stock for 40 years.
Still, the results demonstrate the awesome power of compounding.
Most people don’t have access to a Bloomberg terminal to perform this sort of analysis. But you can do similar calculations for Toronto-Dominion Bank stock using the dividend reinvestment calculator on TD’s website.
To see how TD’s return stacked up, I entered the same starting date of Dec. 31, 1983, and the same initial amount of $34,380 and asked the calculator to determine the investment’s value as of Sept. 29, 2023. The answer was about $5.6million – even better than Royal Bank’s performance.
You can do your own calculations for different amounts and holding periods. I think you’ll agree that the results validate the buy-and-hold approach and the wisdom of reinvesting dividends, which is important to remember when markets are in a funk.
I own units in the Romspen Mortgage Investment Fund and am over 80 years of age. Monthly distributions have been slashed and redemptions have been suspended since last November, and I can’t sell my units on the public market because it’s a private fund. How can the fair market value of the units be determined when I pass away if redemptions are still not permitted?
Romspen operates in a corner of the commercial mortgage lending market that has been hit especially hard by the pandemic and the sharp rise in interest rates. The company, which specializes in construction and predevelopment lending, is facing a liquidity crunch because loan repayments have slowed dramatically. To preserve cash, Romspen has frozen redemptions and announced several cuts to its monthly distribution, which is now two cents per unit, down from seven cents in October, 2021.
This has dealt a blow to unitholders, including many retirees, who flocked to Romspen during better times when it was offering yields that beat the puny returns available on bonds and guaranteed investment certificates.
Now, I’ll address your question about valuing the units. Although there is no public market for the securities, Romspen provides an estimate of the fund’s net asset value on its website each month. In September, the NAV per unit was $9.719. I doubt you would get anything close to that if you were able to sell your units, but Romspen says the NAV – essentially the fund’s assets minus its liabilities – is an accurate reflection of its unit value.
“Although there is not an active public market for such assets as compared to funds that invest in marketable securities, when determining the fair value of any particular mortgage investment, management relies on third-party appraisals and valuations of the underlying real estate collateral, the overall financial strength of the borrower, local market conditions, loan history, and the state of interest rates and real estate credit markets, among other things,” Romspen said in an e-mailed statement.
“While it is reasonable to use the fund’s published NAV as a basis for determining the deemed proceeds of disposition … in estate scenarios, we recommend that unitholders and their representatives consult their own tax advisors.”
The statement added that “Romspen’s investor relations team has considerable experience assisting unitholders and their families with estate situations, and we encourage the investor to reach out to us directly so that we can help with their specific situation.”

Full text: DONE DEAL 55 Wagners Rd., Uxbridge, Ont.
UXBRIDGE Asking price: $839,900 (July 2023) Selling price: $835,000 (July, 2023) Taxes: $2,905 (2023) Days on the market: 15 Listing agents: Marie and Alyssa Persaud, Coldwell Banker R.M.R.
Real Estate THE ACTION This three-bedroom house tugged at the heartstrings of local and out-of-town buyers alike because of its tranquil location on a 100- by 150-foot lot within 200 metres of Wagner Lake.
The first offer on the property, about 90 kilometres northeast of Toronto, was accepted, though it was just shy of the asking price.
“It’s a really nice, small community, close enough to town so you don’t feel isolated,” said agent Marie Persaud. “And it’s a very pretty setting.” WHAT THEY GOT Nearly every room in this roughly 60-year-old house has access to one of two decks wrapped around three sides, from the eat-in kitchen and living room to two bedrooms on the second floor.
Three-piece bathrooms on both levels are connected to a septic system. The basement is a crawl space.
Outdoors there is a shed and a private driveway large enough to park four cars.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “Most of the lots are around that size, and the odd one has a little more land,” Ms. Persaud said.
“You have neighbours nearby, but you also have your privacy, and the house was a comfortable house.”
The site’s proximity to the water appealed to outdoor enthusiasts. “There are people who live all around the lake, and it’s used for boating, canoeing, swimming and fishing,” said Ms. Persaud.

Full text: BEHIND THE ADVICE In this new series, Behind the Advice, we ask advisers about their relationship with money from a young age, lessons learned over the years, and how their experiences shape the advice they give clients today.
Robyn Thompson, founder and wealth consultant at Castlemark Wealth Management Inc. in Toronto, talks about growing up poor and what drove her to pursue a career of helping others build and protect their wealth.
What was your first money lesson?
It was more of an experience I had when I was 10 years old, growing up in Niagara Falls, Ont. I remember the ice cream truck would come to our neighbourhood, and kids would get change from their parents and run out to buy some.
I would ask my mom for money to buy some ice cream, and the answer was almost always the same, ‘Not this week, honey.’ Later at the playground, some of the mean kids would sing to me the Eddie Murphy song Ice Cream Man, which went something like: ‘You don’t have no ice cream … because you’re on welfare.’ Well, you can imagine my reaction.
I wanted to hide inside my own skin. It was the first time I remember feeling like I wasn’t enough. My family used to be middle class and lost its way. My parents divorced a few years later, and my dad lost his business.
My mother was a stay-at-home mom with three daughters. My parents did everything they could, but I was now one of the poor kids. It had a profound effect on me.
How did it influence your money habits as a kid?
I wanted a different life where I didn’t feel poor, so I started working to make money.
I did everything I could as a kid, from walking dogs and delivering newspapers to busing tables and working the midnight shift as a waitress. It allowed me to feel like I was enough. It also made me very scrappy.
What did you learn from this early life experience?
I learned that financial security isn’t about a number. It’s about creating and practising the right attitudes and actions to create wealth. Growing up, I had a front-row seat to witness what not to do. I knew I shouldn’t take on too much debt. I knew I had to make my own money and get and stay educated about wealth.
How did this experience influence your career as an adviser?
I kept this secret of my upbringing from all my clients for years because I thought, ‘Who wants to hire a welfare kid to manage their money?’ But I think helping people understand their relationship with money is at the core of what advisors do. So, I’m not afraid to talk about it anymore because we all have different experiences with money.
What’s the job you thought you wanted growing up?
I didn’t have lofty dreams as a kid. I just knew I wasn’t going to be poor. My first job was in marketing, and then I got into local television and later became a co-anchor/producer at an investment TV show.
Doing that show, I always wondered, ‘Did people take this advice? Did they use it to become wealthy?’ I want to make more money and help others make money, so I decided to become an adviser.
What’s the best investment decision you’ve made?
I’ve invested small amounts of money every month since my early 20s. In my early 30s, my best friend and I bought our first house in an up-and-coming area in Toronto. It was a duplex. We lived on the top floors and rented out the bottom. Eventually, I bought my friend out of the property, and I launched my advisory business in the bottom floor of the building. My business has since moved, but I still own that property today.
Another good decision I made was buying critical illness insurance in my early 30s, knowing that I didn’t have anything to fall back on if I were to get sick. Last year, I had cancer. It’s an interesting experience to receive a critical illness cheque from your insurance company after paying into the policy for 16 years. It showed me that it is important to protect yourself from unforeseen circumstances that can derail your life. It can happen to any one of us at any time. I’m happy to say that I’m now cancer-free, touch wood.
What are you best at when it comes to investing?
Steadily growing wealth, tax-efficiently, across a diversified portfolio of equities, fixed income and real estate. The small steps we take every day can lead to extraordinary gains in the future. It’s consistency that makes a difference.
What worries you about money? I worry about losing it like my family did. I worry about living life in reverse. After all this time, you’d think those fears would be very far away from me, but fears around money don’t disappear. You carry them with you. You just relate to them differently. I also discuss this with my clients to help them deal with their money fears.

Full text: Picture this: You open your laptop and look up.
And the view isn’t your apartment wall, but a sandy beach or a lush rainforest. This is the reality for many digital nomads. And there’s more of them, too: The number of people who travel freely while working remotely has grown significantly since COVID-19 forced many to work from home.
According to Think Remote, a media company focused on remote work, in 2020, 10.9 million people worldwide described themselves as digital nomads; by the end of 2022, this number more than tripled. Some of these folks are self-employed entrepreneurs or freelancers and some work for companies that are either fully remote or have policies that allow for short stints abroad.
We talked to several Canadian remote workers on the best destinations they’ve set up shop in over the past year; plus, two experts weigh in on the pros and cons to consider when working from these locales.
BALI, INDONESIA WHO: Nadene Rehnby, 57 WHAT THEY DO: Graphic designer HOME BASE: Vancouver Rehnby has been working remotely for more than a decade. “I sort of stumbled into it,” she says. She had an offer to rent her house during the 2010 Olympics and hasn’t looked back since. She’s at home half of the year – she shares the space with roommates who help cover the cost of her mortgage – and the rest of the time she’s on the road. In the past year she’s been to Mexico, Indonesia, the U.S. and across B.C. While she loves being a digital nomad, she acknowledges its challenges, such as the social isolation, carbon footprint and how an influx of foreigners to certain areas can drive up costs for locals.
In Bali, she spent time in Ubud (including a stay at a digital nomad co-living centre), Gili Trawangan, Nusa Lembongan, Nusa Penida and Canggu. “I love everything about Bali,” she says. “The kindness of the people, the daily ritual of practising gratitude, the lush nature, the affordable cost of living – I could go on.” She notes that Canggu attracts many digital nomads, but is loud and crowded. However, islands like Gili T have a more laidback lifestyle, which includes biking, scuba lessons, watching outdoor movies and listening to live music.
WHAT THE EXPERTS SAY: “There are generally two major areas in Bali that are frequented by digital nomads,” says Liam Martin, who is from Ottawa and is one of the organizers of Running Remote, the world’s largest conference on building and scaling remote teams.
Rehnby was right: “Canggu is great if you love to beach and party,” says Martin. However, it also has dozens of co-working spaces, co-living communities, as well as cafés to work from. (He recommends Livit for co-working and Outpost for co-living.) “It’s seen massive growth and investment post-COVID with real estate prices increasing by a whopping 50 per cent plus in the last few years.” He says that Ubud has a very different feel. “Lots of yoga studios, lush jungles, relaxed lifestyle and longer-term ‘slowmads’ usually live here,” Martin notes. He adds that Outpost has another co-living space in Ubud (this is the one Rehnby stayed at). “If you’re looking for a multiple month stay, I’d choose Ubud versus Canggu.” SYROS, GREECE WHO: Rekha Magon, 39, Rik Magon, 47, and their 11- and nine-year-old kids WHAT THEY DO: Entrepreneurs HOME BASE: Montreal Rekha has been a self-employed entrepreneur for many years, which has always given her the freedom to work remotely. In 2021, she co-founded Boundless Life, a company that offers living abroad experiences for families – complete with housing, education for kids and more.
Over the past 18 months, Rekha and her family have spent time in Portugal, Greece and Italy. Rekha and her husband, a real estate developer, worked remotely and their son and daughter attended Boundless Life education centres. When she reflects on her family’s time in Syros, Rekha points to its affordable cost of living, proximity to other Greek islands – such as Mykonos, Tinos and Ikaria – and culture of work-life balance. “Our children had an unforgettable experience,” she says. “From sailing lessons in the Aegean Sea to mastering the art of crafting fresh Greek cheese. … In fact, my son was so inspired by the food that he decided to dress up as a souvlaki for Halloween.”
WHAT THE EXPERTS SAY: “Generally, as a Canadian, you don’t need a visa to go for a short-term visit to Greece,” says Evelyn Ackah, the founder and managing lawyer of Calgary-based Ackah Business Immigration Law. “But if it’s going to be longer than a few months, you may need to leave and come back in.” If you do plan on staying in any country for a longer period of time, Ackah says that remote workers should prepare to be adaptable. “If you’re moving around a lot, that’s fine. I think it’s easier if you’re a month here and a month there. … It’s harder when you’re spending a long block of time somewhere,” she says. “If there’s uncertainty of what’s going to happen at the airport or the consulate, you’ve got to be flexible. So, if you can’t get to Greece, for example, you go to Istanbul instead.” Also, because Europe is known for its road trips, Ackah says to make sure you have an international driver’s licence. “If you’re driving as opposed to Ubering everywhere … you can’t be sure, necessarily, if your licence will be valid or how long it will be.” TURRUBARES, COSTA RICA WHO: Siya Zarrabi and Kristen Sarah, both 37, and their five-year-old daughter WHAT THEY DO: Content creators HOME BASE: Brampton, Ont.
These high-school sweethearts have worked remotely full-time for almost a decade on the travel blog Hopscotch the Globe. They usually spend about three to four months a year travelling – in 2023, they were in Costa Rica, the U.S., Croatia and other parts of Canada. “Working from Costa Rica is pretty great,” says Sarah. “You can spend a few hours working, take a break and go for a short drive to a waterfall, jump in, have a picnic … and then head back to wherever there’s a WiFi signal and work a little longer.”
Sarah says rent in Costa Rica – ranging from $300 to $2,000 a month, or more – depends on location. In Turrubares, 95 kilometres southwest of San José, they spent $1,000 to rent a three-bedroom, two-storey house for a month. “It had the most incredible jungle views on one side and a volcano on the other.” She adds that renting a car isn’t cheap (around $350 a week) – “but if you’re somewhere where you can walk everywhere, like a beach town, a car isn’t necessary.”
WHAT THE EXPERTS SAY: “You don’t need a visa to go to Costa Rica as a Canadian citizen. But if you’re a citizen of another country, you might,” says Ackah. “I’ve been there too several times … and the culture is so laid back.”
However, she says that knowing the laws is important.
“Sometimes people think: ‘Well it’s the same as Canada or the U.S.,’ but every country is different.” (For example: driving over 150 kilometres an hour in Costa Rica can land you in jail.) “Know the laws to keep you safe and also to keep you in good standing so they’ll let you come back.”
Ackah says that travel insurance is of course important – no matter where you choose to work remotely – but you also need to consider how long you’re away from home. “You run the risk of losing your Canadian provincial coverage if you’re gone for six months or more,” she says. “The snow birds all come back in just under six months for that exact reason.” PORTLAND, ORE.
WHO: Sierra Riley, 27 WHAT THEY DO: Journalist and former Narcity editor HOME BASE: Vancouver Riley has been working remotely since 2021. With loved ones living across Canada and the globe – from Ontario to Dubai – she often combines visiting family with working from wherever she happens to be. Over the past year, she’s worked from Calgary, Toronto and Portland, proving that the digital nomad life doesn’t need to be in some far-flung destination.
She didn’t expect to love Portland as much as she did.
“I mostly chose the city because it was a short, cheap and scenic train ride away,” she says. “Plus, Oregon doesn’t have a state sales tax, so that helped keep travel costs low.” Also, via her subscription to Trusted House Sitters ($169 a year), a worldwide pet- and house-sitting website, she scored free accommodations – and a furry friend – during her stay.
Portland’s pros? Riley says the food truck scene, parks, thrift stores and indie movie theatres. The cons? Although she has travel insurance through her credit card, she says “getting health care was a bit of a worry, but thankfully no need for a doctor’s visit arose.”
WHAT THE EXPERTS SAY: Ahead of an extended U.S. stay, Ackah suggests talking to a legal adviser so you know what to say to an agent at the border. “I’ve had clients where maybe their spouse got a U.S. work permit and they’re coming along and going to continue working remotely within Canada. And they say, ‘You can’t do that without a work permit,’ and it becomes a big to-do.”
Ackah adds that health benefits and taxes are important to keep in mind. “Make sure you have travel insurance because, as we know, the U.S. is so expensive with health coverage,” she says. “It’s also important to talk to a cross-border tax specialist. It might just require a filing even if there’s no income from the States.” TULUM, MEXICO WHO: Lulu Liang, 30 WHAT THEY DO: Entrepreneur and former media executive HOME BASE: Was Toronto and is now Lisbon Liang and her husband were living downtown, working from home in Toronto when COVID-19 hit. When the time came to renew their lease in June, 2020, they decided to move out and start their digital nomad journey.
At first, they tested the waters in Canada – North Bay, Calgary, Vancouver – and in November, 2020, they left the country. This year, they’ve spent time in Tulum and Madrid, as well as in their new home base in Lisbon (Portugal is another hot spot for digital nomads, according to Martin). The couple bought a place in Tulum in 2021 for US$100,000 and spend a big part of each year there. “We get around on a scooter when we want to go into town or the beach,” says Liang. “Otherwise, I walk around our area, which has a great expat community.” Liang loves Tulum’s accessibility to Toronto (a direct four-hour flight from nearby Cancun), great weather, fast internet, low cost of living and “five-star vacation-like weekends.”
WHAT THE EXPERTS SAY: “Tulum has recently had significant investments in internet connectivity, which allows for great connection to work remotely,” says Martin. “It’s also a short drive to Playa del Carmen – which is another digital nomad hot spot – and Cancun, which is one of the most popular airports in the world and has direct flights to 29 different countries.” Martin says that staying in the city is significantly cheaper than renting oceanside and that it’s just a short car or bike ride to the beach. “My general suggestion is to set yourself up at a hotel coworking space like Selina Tulum and spend a week getting your bearings and figuring out which location you’d like to set up in.” However, if you are looking to save money, he adds that travelling in the off season will get you a good deal. “If you can deal with the heat, it’s very cheap in the summer months,” he says. “And keep in mind that the sargassum season can come and go; so, if you want a seaweed-free beach, I would check ahead for conditions.”

Full text: VANCOUVER For anyone interested in a crash course on the recent history of Vancouver’s housing crisis, they need to look no further than the work of professor David Ley.
In 2010, Prof. Ley wrote a seminal book, Millionaire Migrants: Trans-Pacific Life Lines, on the impact of large amounts of cash poured into Vancouver’s property market after Expo 86. Now, he’s released a follow-up book, Housing Booms in Gateway Cities, which looks at cities that are disproportionately affected by real estate investment.
Of course, Vancouver is among them. So too are London, Hong Kong, Sydney and Singapore – the outlier in the group that does not have a housing crisis.
A gateway city is a city through which international trade and immigrant labour is part of its economic engine, which makes it a vibrant and cosmopolitan urban centre. Gateway cities are also prone to wildly unstable housing markets and social inequality.
Prof. Ley, a recent recipient of the Order of Canada, found that in the cities he travelled to and investigated – with the exception of Singapore – there has been a significant decoupling between the price of housing and incomes. In other words, many people can no longer buy a home with the amount they make.
“Of course, the old story of labour economics is that labour markets and housing markets are linked together, so house prices go up as people prosper in the labour market,” Prof. Ley said in an interview. “Well, that is clearly out the window in gateway cities. So what is it that is causing this tremendous uncoupling that we see on three different continents, Europe, North America and Asia?
That’s question No. 1.
“Question No. 2 is what are the consequences of this decoupling?
When we’re thinking of affordability, we think of inequality and potentially even instability – political instability – which could reflect itself in people’s behaviour at the ballot box. The argument I make with Hong Kong is lack of housing is one of the reasons students are rioting.
“An argument could be made that it causes the marginalization of the young, which we find in all of these cities. … That the housing wealth belongs to people of my generation, and for people of my kids’ generation, it’s a totally different story,” Prof. Ley said.
The third question is, what is the government doing about the problem?
His 2010 book dove into the influx of East Asian wealth that was reshaping Vancouver, the result, he said, of the provincial government’s courting of Asian money that began around the time of Expo 86, which he refers to in the new book as “a marketing venture.” That led to the purchase of the Expo 86 lands by Hong Kong billionaire Li Ka-Shing, a controversial $320-million deal that, in turn, opened the floodgates to a torrent of new money.
Shortly after the purchase, writes Prof. Ley, Hong Kong’s four largest property developers began to snap up Vancouver real estate.
The new money was not a matter of serendipity. The decision to sell off the Expo lands in its entirety, instead of piecemeal, was clearly intended to attract a foreign investor with deep pockets.
And it worked.
The investment came in waves, starting with Hong Kong buyers who were looking for a safe place to land after the 1997 handover to China, followed by Taiwanese buyers, and eventually buyers from mainland China.
In Millionaire Migrants, Prof.
Ley has a line graph that shows house prices in Greater Vancouver moving upward in lockstep with net domestic migration.
The governments of the day saw benefits in growing tax revenues and growing homeowner equity for its citizens.
As global and domestic investors fuelled the market, the relationship between the real estate industry and the government also became an especially cozy one.
In the new book, he points out that development companies were the single largest group of donors to the BC Liberal Party.
But a problem emerged. By 2016, at the peak of the boom, the divergence between local incomes and home prices in Vancouver had never been wider.
That same gap had grown in London, Sydney and Hong Kong as well.
Only Singapore maintained a parallel growth between incomes and home prices. Prof. Ley said that’s because that city’s real estate market is state-controlled, with 80 per cent of Singaporean residents owning leasehold properties. Foreign buying and investor buying is tightly controlled and hugely taxed. Singapore raised its foreign-buyer tax to a whopping 60 per cent and local investors get taxed 20 per cent on second properties.
He also discovered that Singaporeans (and Hong Kongers) were active investors in London, where there were few restrictions on global investment.
In Vancouver, existing homeowners reaped the benefits of sky-high real estate prices. But boomer-age parents began to see that their children were being priced out of the property market, and those who could buy in were taking on a lifetime of mortgage debt. Renters who thought they had homes discovered their landlord had other plans for their high-priced assets. Displacement through renovictions, or “nofault evictions,” (such as when the landlord says a relative will be moving in) became rampant.
And yet, when questioned throughout the 2013-to-2016 boom, public officials said they couldn’t meddle with homeowner equity, or even acquire the data to prove that foreign money had entered the market. It was painfully ironic, in light of the fact that the government had courted the money via trade missions and, at the federal level, offered Canadian citizenship in exchange for business investment, as part of a now-defunct scheme called the Immigrant Investor Program.
Tens of thousands of Asian investors came to Canada through the program, intended to create jobs.
Instead, many of those new investors chose to buy properties in Vancouver, and no one could blame them. Vancouver housing was a highly lucrative investment. The city had built an economy around it: local investors too were in on the action.
However, the program was recognized as a policy failure and finally cancelled. After so many years, there was no easy way to turn the ship around.
A key Angus Reid Foundation survey in 2015 identified widespread public fury at a situation that had seemingly gone out of control. All three levels of government eventually paid the price at the ballot box for failing to grasp the growing misery of its electorate, including the Conservative federal government, the BC Liberal Party and the municipal-level Vision Vancouver party.
Responding to public backlash and growing media scrutiny, housing affordability became the key election platform for all parties.
We have now entered a phase of potential “re-regulation,” writes Prof. Ley, with “attempts to re-regulate a housing market made dysfunctional by the incessant flow of unregulated investment capital and the marketization of state policy within a neoliberal regime. Substantial golden visa immigration, in addition to offshore buyers, established a strong transnational residential sales network between Vancouver and East Asia after 1986, adding significant speculative investment to local demand. By 2016, the aspiration of home ownership as asset-based welfare had reached a dead end for many residents.”
The “growth coalition” had “decimated affordability, precariously inflated mortgage debt loads, shut out first-time buyers, and aggravated spiralling inequality.”
Is there a way to narrow the gap between incomes and home prices?
Prof. Ley said that “cooling off” measures need to be implemented in a continuous way, as in Singapore, not simply as a one-off solution.
“With current policies, I see little prospect that there will be a narrowing of the decoupling gap,” Prof. Ley said. “There has to be much more determination to control the entire property investment picture, foreign and local, and build the right kind of supply, that is truly affordable supply.”

NEW PORT, N.S.
Asking Price: $2,795,000 Taxes: N/A Land Size: 100 acres Agent: Piers Baker, Duckworth Real Estate THE BACKSTORY Acclaimed photographer Sherman Hines was on assignment in the Annapolis Valley of Nova Scotia when he spotted the ruins of a stone building in the rolling hills.
He asked his companion to stop the car so he could clamber up the slope to have a better look. There he found a tumbledown structure with no remaining windows or doors to block his entry to its mysterious subterranean passageways and rooms.
Mr. Hines travels internationally as a photographer and lecturer but he has made an avocation of renovating historic buildings in his home province of Nova Scotia.
As he explored beneath the arched doorways and vaulted ceilings, Mr. Hines recognized that the building was centuries old. He also decided in an instant that he wanted to restore it.
“I just couldn’t believe it. I thought: ‘This one is the best I’ll ever do.’ It was so incredible.”
He discovered that the relic dated to 1699 when French settlers built a mission close to the St. Croix and Avon Rivers in the traditional territory of the Mi’kmaw.
The French and English controlled different parts of the province at the time, and the local abbé requested a strongly fortified building to shelter the priests who lived inside his mission and served the Acadian people.
The underground rooms, Mr. Hines learned, were used for storing ammunition.
The Acadians were expelled from the province in the mid-1750s by the British, and the lands became the property of King George II of England, local records show.
By 1760, the township of Newport was created and the property was granted to two young men from Rhode Island, according to real estate agent Piers Baker of Duckworth Real Estate.
The property changed hands again when John Chambers arrived at Newport Landing from Newport, R.I., and turned the former mission into his own home in 1761.
By the time Mr. Hines happened upon the building in the early 1980s, it had long been abandoned.
He purchased the derelict mission on 115 acres of farmland and began the arduous task of rebuilding.
THE HOUSE TODAY Mr. Hines was entranced with the building from the start, but his wife, Andrea Hines, was much more dubious.
The photographer assured her that he would handle the design and oversee the work until the house was restored to the extent that she could bake a loaf of bread in the new kitchen.
The house was built of fieldstone collected from the surrounding meadows by the Acadians, who needed to clear the land for agriculture, Mr. Hines explains.
“The stone had collapsed a little bit. It was built in 1699, so I guess it had the right to collapse.”
He was able to reclaim the original rocks and reconstruct the missing parts of the walls.
Mr. Hines estimates the transformation took about two years as he rebuilt rooms and dug down into the cellars to create nooks and hallways under the barrel ceilings.
Several rooms have fireplaces, including an original brick fireplace and bake oven that Mr. Hines restored.
“They made the brick right in the backyard, from the red clay that has always been there,” Mr. Hines says. “It’s extremely strong.”
Throughout the reconstruction, Mr. Hines researched the property and local history to discover how it looked in its day.
During his travels in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and England, he collected antique materials.
“I find cow barns, hay barns and old houses,” he says. “I find the building either fallen down, falling down, or still standing.”
Sometimes Mr. Hines would purchase an entire structure.
A farmer down the road wanted to dispose of a circa 1888 church on his land, so Mr. Hines had it jacked up and moved to his property on a flatbed truck.
“It was used as a hay barn. It was full of hay when I bought it,” he recalls.
Mr. Hines was inspired by traditional farms in England, where stone barns, stores and other structures were often attached to the main house. The placement of the buildings created an inner courtyard protected from the elements.
At the Mission, Mr. Hines had an antique barn taken apart and rebuilt to attach to one end of the home. The church in turn is attached to the barn.
“The church is the party room,” he says.
Across the front yard stands a low stone building that contains the garage and Mr. Hines’s office.
The restored estate provides 8,585 square feet of living area with five bedrooms and 41/2 bathrooms.
There are several living areas, casual spots for meals and a dining room for entertaining.
As the project took shape, the Hineses and their two boys continued to live in Toronto and used the restored mission mainly as a summer retreat. Eventually, they moved to Nova Scotia.
Along the way, Mr. Hines added several outbuildings, including a chicken coop, a gift shop and a log cabin that stands next to the pond as an homage to his father’s hunting cabin.
Outside, the land includes woods and walking trails. The hay grown in the fields is given to local farmers.
There’s also a tennis court, an in-ground pool and an air jet tub.
“We have a swimming pool hidden in the back – it’s not period.”
Mr. Hines has spent much of his career capturing images of the country’s natural beauty. He has published more than 100 books, including the coffee-table tome Extraordinary Light: A Vision of Canada. He currently has five more in progress and continues to photograph his surroundings every day.
“I took a picture this morning of three deer outside my window eating apples,” Mr. Hines says.
Mr. Hines has carved out 15 acres of the property that will be kept for the family. A stand of woods between the main house and the parcel will maintain the privacy of the new owners.
He plans to build another log cabin that he and Ms. Hines can visit in retirement.
“My two boys wanted to make sure I save a piece for them.”
THE BEST FEATURE A few years ago, Ms. Hines was feeling cramped cooking in the small kitchen and the couple decided to create a larger and more luxurious space.
Mr. Hines had one wall taken down to extend the house and build a kitchen with wooden cabinets, a chef’s range, an island and a built-in desk. There’s also a sitting area with a fireplace.
To build the walls of the addition, Mr. Hines found fieldstones around the perimeter of his land that had been piled up by the Acadians and left in place for more than 300 years. Where they had settled into the earth, he had them dug out.
“I got the stone from the same place they got the original,” he says. “It’s a perfect match. We have enough piles of red rocks around here, we could build another house.”

French investment manager opens Montreal arm: Ardian’s first Canadian office aims to tap sustainable investments

Full text: French private equity company Ardian SAS is opening its first office in Canada to tap what it says is fertile ground for sustainable investments in renewable energy and other sectors.
The Paris-based firm, which counts about US$9.3-billion from Canadian clients out of US$156billion in total assets under management, is setting up shop in Montreal with a dozen employees to start. The team will be led by Frédérick Castonguay, a finance specialist who previously worked at Blue Bridge Wealth Management and Rio Tinto.
The company sees a chance to build on existing partnerships with Canadian pension funds, endowments and other investors. It says having a team on the ground in Canada will boost opportunities for socially responsible investing, adding to Ardian’s existing Canadian holdings such as Maple Leaf – a battery storage joint venture in Ontario with energy supplier Enel X.
“We have a big ambition to grow our footprint,” Mark Benedetti, a member of Ardian’s executive committee and co-head of its U.S. business, said in an interview. “I really feel like it’s just the beginning. I think we can do a lot here.”
The private investment house will take a broad view when weighing how to spend fund money in Canada, Mr. Benedetti said. Still, there will be some clear focus areas, such as renewable energy.
“That could be wind, that could be solar, that could be hydrogen. That could be part of the hydrogen value chain,” he said.
“So it’s not just in the creation of the energy itself but also all the different players that contribute to that.”
The Canadian government announced $80-billion in tax credits and investments in its spring budget aimed at promoting clean energy and sustainable infrastructure projects over the next decade. Observers have said they represent an unprecedented industrial policy leap by Canadian standards, even if they are dwarfed in many sectors by new American spending widely expected to surpass Washington’s projection of US$370-billion over a similar period.
Ardian’s investments span private equity, infrastructure, real estate and credit. Montreal will be its third office in North America after New York and San Francisco.
On Thursday, it will announce what it calls a “pioneering private equity investment platform” dedicated to the semi-conductor industry, largely focused on European companies. The sector is hugely strategic for the global economy, with semi-conductor components found in a plethora of consumer and commercial products, from cars to computers.
In addition to Maple Leaf, Ardian’s corporate investments in Canada include Syntax, a Montreal-based IT services company, and Montreal-based New Look Vision, Canada’s biggest eyewear retailer. Clients in Canada include pension giant Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, the City of Montreal, University of Montreal, the Fondation Chagnon and Investment Management Corp. of Ontario.
The Caisse was an early backer of Ardian, when it was the private equity arm of French insurer Axa.
Among the first commitments Ardian received from a third-party investor was from the pension fund manager, around 1997.
French businesswoman Dominique Senequier led an employee buyout of Axa Private Equity in 2013 and created Ardian.
That relationship with the Caisse led to other local investors for Ardian, and it’s a key part of the reason Ardian set up in Montreal, Mr. Benedetti said. “We owe them a lot,” he said of the Caisse.
“It was important to be there with them, alongside them and interacting with them locally with our office here.”

Full text: Alain Brumont’s Château Bouscassé and Montus vineyards in Madiran have brought international recognition to southwest France, but he remembers the region having zero reputation with wine lovers some 40 years ago, when he first got his start in the 1980s.
Not even the local farmers thought much of the grapes and wines made in this remote, hilly area in the foothills of the Pyrenees Mountain about an hour away from Bordeaux. Brumont, who quit school at 16 to work at his family’s estate, Château Bouscassé, recalls how he relied on knowledge gleaned from books and magazines and a trip to Bordeaux in 1979 to figure out how to produce quality wines in Madiran.
“There was no real target or local benchmark to work toward,” Brumont explains. The ideal was to make the best wines that he and his vineyards could produce.
Embracing experimentation and innovation, Brumont bottled his first wines in 1982 and produced Cuvée Prestige, the region’s first 100-percent tannat-based red wine in 1985.
These early releases captured the attention of wine buyers who were surprised by the richness and refinement compared with the traditionally coarse and firm regional wines.
Decisions to reduce the yields of grapes in the vineyard, hand pick the fruit instead of using machines and age his wines in oak barrels helped Brumont create red wines with a fruity and polished character. Even after decades of success, there’s a push to continue to refine how the grapes are grown and wines are made. Brumont believes there’s still much to learn about making wine in southwest France, particularly ones produced from the region’s tannat grape.
“I was told that each year I need to conduct 20 different experiments in the vineyard and 20 different experiments in the cellar,” says Antoine Veiry, Brumont’s stepson who joined the cellar in 2017 after having worked in Champagne, the south of France and Australia. “I must always be looking to make improvements for the future.”
The 2017 vintage of Château Bouscassé has recently been released at Vintages outlets in Ontario. Brumont undertakes the initial aging in his cellars, keeping bottles back for four or five years so they are ready to drink on release. (Other premium selections, such as Montus XL and the single-vineyard release, La Tyre, are kept for 10 years before being made available to consumers.) This is a substantial wine that promises to mature gracefully in the bottle over the next decade. It’s a tremendous representation of what the Madiran region is capable of producing but continues to be underappreciated compared with wines of similar quality produced in nearby Bordeaux. That’s good news for value hunters looking for affordable wines to cellar.
Bouscassé is a featured recommendation alongside three other red wines that stood out in recent tastings as worthy additions to the cellar.
Keep in mind, you’ll want to taste these – or any wine – you’re thinking of saving for later to make sure you enjoy it. That way, you’ll also have a better appreciation of how its flavour and texture has evolved as it gains more complexity.
BOTTLES TO TRY BACHELDER WISMER FOXCROFT GAMAY NOIR 33% WHOLE CLUSTER 2021 (CANADA) SCORE: 93 PRICE: $29.95 Gamay wasn’t originally on Niagara winemaker Thomas Bachelder’s radar. His focus was strictly on chardonnay and pinot noir before the potential of this other variety captured his imagination in 2016.
Working with grapes grown at the Wismer Foxcroft vineyard in Vineland, Bachelder has captured the quintessential character of Niagara gamay here. There’s a concentrated core of ripe red fruit with some peppery notes that add complexity and interest. It’s bright and flavourful so it’s easy to appreciate right now, but it’s a style I tend to enjoy with more richness and development from bottle age. Drink now to 2028. Available at the above price in Ontario, $33 in Quebec.
CHÂTEAU BOUSCASSÉ 2017 (FRANCE) SCORE: 92 PRICE: $23.95 This is a seriously complex and age-worthy red wine for its price. A blend of 60 per cent tannat with 20 per cent each of cabernet franc and cabernet sauvignon, this offers appealing fragrance and flavour, with a satisfying mix of dark fruit, floral and smoky notes. Extensive aging in oak barrels and bottle (two years before release) mean this is ready to drink now, with the structure and balance to age over the next decade.
Drink now to 2033. Available at the above price in Ontario, various prices in British Columbia and Alberta, $21.85 in Quebec.
CHÂTEAU TEYNAC 2016 (FRANCE) SCORE: 91 PRICE: $69.95 Working from a 12.5-hectare estate in Saint-Julien, this cabernet sauvignon-dominant red blend offers attractive ripe fruit flavours with cedar and some fragrant green notes, suggesting fennel and fern, adding complexity. A nicely balanced wine, with supple texture and a persistent finish, this should mature nicely.
Drink now to 2030. Available in Ontario.
FAMILLE PERRIN LA GILLE GIGONDAS 2020 (FRANCE) SCORE: 91 PRICE: $32.95 A satisfying blend of grenache, syrah and mourvedre from Gigondas in the southern Rhône Valley, this red wine offers nicely balanced fruit, floral and spice flavours. The style is ripe and inviting, with integrated tannins and alcohol that will help this mature gracefully in the cellar. Drink now to 2030. Available at the above price in Ontario, $46.99 in British Columbia (Marquis Wine Cellars), $38.99 in Manitoba, $32.75 in Quebec.

A heritage house with a beach as its rec room: The 117-year-old home commands a prime spot in Toronto’s Beaches neighbourhood

Full text: 71 Lee Ave.
TORONTO Asking Price: $3,099,999 Taxes: $7,702.00 (2023) Lot Size: 50 by 120 feet Listing agent: Shea Warrington, Royal LePage Estate Realty THE BACKSTORY For more than 117 years, four generations of the Clayton family have lived in and preserved the house at 71 Lee Ave. The home, across the road from Kew Gardens and a leisurely stroll to Balmy Beach and the boardwalk, commands a prime spot in Toronto’s Beaches neighbourhood.
Margot Clayton said her greatgrandfather owned the local butcher shop up the street (at 2018 Queen St. E, now a Hero Burger). He sold a lakeside cottage and used the money to buy building lots on Lee Avenue when it was first being developed; numbers 59 and 71, with 71 being a double-wide lot. His son, Harry Clayton, carried on the butcher business. Harry died in 1955.
Ms. Clayton’s father, William, grew up at 71 Lee Ave. and worked with his dad in the butcher shop – delivering cuts of meat on his bicycle. He raised Margot and her siblings in the house, too.
Long-time residents of the Beaches will recognize 71 Lee for its unusual side lot that for decades was almost completely given over to formal gardens.
“The family were all gardeners – great grandpa had roses galore – and part of our life was weeding that garden and learning to get those weeds at the root and pull,” Ms. Clayton said. These days, there’s more sod than planned horticulture. “My mom’s been gradually covering it over. … It was getting a little bit much for her.”
The family is bundling the side lot into the sale, but since they had severed it a number of years ago the two 25-foot-wide lots are for sale separately (for $1.799million and $1.29-million), according to listing agent Shea Warrington.
THE HOUSE TODAY The house has been well preserved on the exterior. The wooden siding is almost entirely original: Growing up, Ms. Clayton’s father insisted on stripping it back to the bare wood and repainting it at least once a decade. The wire fence across the side lot was handmade in 1906 and has been painted and repainted countless times over the years. “I was always told, no matter what you do, never take this fence down,” Ms. Clayton said.
The complex latticework over the front porch has been replaced but was painstakingly redone to mirror the original.
“That to me is that house: There’s a picture of my grandpa and my grandmother sitting on the veranda reading Life magazine, in the exact same chairs that are still there,” Ms. Clayton said. “We had so many parties: We’d get our dinner and sit on this veranda and we’re right across from Kew Gardens.
There’d be bands in the park, it would be packed with people.”
Her mother – now 92 years old – still owns the house, but the family has agreed now is the time to sell. Still, it’s been an emotional experience packing up.
The house still has its original stained-glass windows, solid oak doors, even the original brass doorknobs and switch plates.
Some of the wood floors are covered in carpeting, but the wood trim, brick fireplaces and built-in leaded glass cabinetry still shine bright.
A foyer with stairs heading upstairs connects to a sitting room at the front of the house that opens into the back half of the main floor.
The dining room, 18 feet long, is separated from the kitchen and sitting room by doors. When she was growing up, Ms. Clayton said, this was one of the central spaces in the house.
“Those homes have huge dining rooms. There’s a table there from the butcher’s, a gorgeous table that could easily sit 12. We have pictures of the generations sitting there,” she said. “We’d always have these great meals – my dad, he still had all the bone knives. We had a lot of good times in that dining room.”
The kitchen is a mix of eras: As far as she knows, said Ms. Clayton, the rubber tile floor is from 1906 while the tin ceiling was removed from the Queen Street butcher shop when it closed in the postwar period. The cabinets are a more recent update.
“That floor is just beautiful.
Most people would have put tile down,” said Ms. Clayton, but her parents always focused on preserving and maintaining the home as it was. “They took incredible care of things. It was that generation: everything wasn’t just replaceable.”
There are five bedrooms on the second and third floors. Unlike a more modern home, none features an ensuite bathroom. In fact, there’s only one bathroom in the whole house: It’s on the second floor and it has an original cast-iron tub. And no, it does not have a shower.
The primary bedroom connects to a large sunroom with skylights that runs across the front of the house above the front porch.
A HOUSE OF ANOTHER ERA Ms. Clayton is 61. Despite having grown up in the 1960s and 70s, in many ways, her childhood in the house sounds like it came from an earlier era. Unlike many of her contemporaries who lived in suburban homes with big rec rooms or TV-oriented living rooms, her house was designed for life before television (for that matter it pre-exists commercial radio) and the family was never keen on reconfigurations to sync with modernity.
And anyway, who needs to veg out in front of a TV when Kew Gardens and Balmy Beach are your rec room? “We were an adventuresome family; we all sailed at Ashbridges Bay and went to the Balmy Beach canoe club, always on our bikes on the boardwalk going here and there,” Ms. Clayton said.
After leaving for university, she eventually moved back to the neighbourhood (her brother did the same) drawn as if by a magnet back to the home waters.
“Once a Beacher always a Beacher,” she said. “It has gotten more busy, but still, relative to the rest of the city, we are a small town.”

PHOTOGRAPHER FOUGHT TO PRESERVE MONTREAL’S ARCHITECTURAL GEMS: AT A TIME WHEN MANY CITY LANDMARKS WERE BEING DESTROYED, HE WAS INVOLVED IN ORGANIZATIONS AIMED AT SAVING THEM, TOOK PHOTOS OF THEM AND WORKED TO STOP THOSE TRYING TO TEAR THEM DOWN

Full text: Brian Merrett was a photographer and activist who became deeply involved in not only recording Montreal’s architecture but in preserving it. His work helped save the building that became the Canadian Centre for Architecture (CCA). He lived up the road from the old Shaughnessy House, named after one of the early presidents of the Canadian Pacific Railway. At the time, the building was occupied by an order of nuns. Mr. Merrett knew they were going to abandon the building and that it probably would be torn down for development.
“He talked the nuns into letting him take photos inside the building,” his wife, Lucinda Lyman, said. He discovered the building when parts of his downtown Montreal neighbourhood were torn down for roadwork.
“In 1972 and 1973, after the transformation of my own street into a motorway exit ramp – which had made my parking space disappear – my monthly visits to the nuns’ house, which now housed my car, encouraged me to produce photographic documentation which ultimately prevented the demolition of this house,” Mr. Merrett said.
Mr. Merrett approached Phyllis Lambert, a member of the wealthy Bronfman family, and showed her the photographs. Ms. Lambert, an architect and promoter of architectural causes, bought the Shaughnessy mansion in 1974 and transformed it into the CCA.
“This is how I became active in Save Montreal, and in 1975, I was invited to be part of the founding board of Heritage Montreal. For these two organizations, I prepared numerous photographs of threatened buildings,” said Mr. Merrett, who died on Sept. 21 at his home in North Hatley, Que., at the age of 78.
Brian Merrett was born on July 29, 1945, in Saint John, N.B. His father, John Campbell Merrett, was there working on an urban plan for Saint John. He was a prominent architect whose work included the Art Deco interior of Central Station in Montreal. Brian grew up in Senneville, a semi-rural suburb at the western tip of Montreal and was influenced by his father’s architectural ideas.
His first camera was a 35 mm, which he won in a Popsicle contest when he was 12. He became an avid photographer, and his first professional job was in 1969, photographing the Bank of Montreal building for his father’s firm.
In Montreal, the 1970s were a time of rampant destruction of older buildings. Mr. Merrett was involved in organizations to save landmarks such as Windsor Station, the 19th-century Canadian Pacific Railway headquarters, which the company wanted to tear down. That campaign was a success, and he photographed not only the station but the neighbourhood around it, which is now almost all changed, replaced with high-rise towers, though the station itself remains.
The fight to save the Van Horne mansion, named after another builder of the CPR, was a failure. Mr. Merrett photographed the razing of the Van Horne building in Montreal by the real estate developer David Azrieli in September, 1973. Witnessing the demolition of heritage buildings in the city transformed Mr. Merrett from a photographer to an activist.
“I think I spent my youth at protests and gallery openings,” said his son, Toby Merrett, who says some of his father’s most important work lives on in the books he published.
The first book he published was in 1987, Mansions of the Golden Square Mile, Montreal, 18501930, in conjunction with François Rémillard, who wrote the text. The Golden Square Mile was where the Montreal establishment lived in the late 19th century and the start of the 20th.
The two men collaborated on several books, most, though not all, concerned with Montreal heritage architecture. Their last book, on the great houses of Quebec City, came out in October, 2022.
The McCord Stewart Museum in Montreal is cataloguing thousands of Mr. Merrett’s photographs, which he donated to the institution.
“Brian has done so much for the safeguarding of Montreal’s architectural heritage and helping people, through the books that he published, and through his more artistic photographs of Montreal architecture and helping people appreciate the beauty of what surrounds them,” said Zoe Tousignant, the curator of photography at the McCord. “His work is a record of the urban fabric of Montreal as it was evolving.”
Mr. Merrett was the staff photographer at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts for many years.
His job there involved taking photographs at exhibitions but also of individual works of art, something that is a unique talent, says Stéphane Aquin, director of the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts.
“There’s really a lot of knowledge, technique and sensitivity that goes into photographing objects. Paintings can come out as flat or not, depending on the lighting. Same with sculptures and silverware,” Mr. Aquin said.
But Mr. Merrett’s architectural photography is what he will be remembered for.
“Brian is one of the great photographers of Montreal’s evolution and changes over the years,” Mr. Aquin said. “He would be at the top of the list with people like William Notman. Through Notman, we have a sense of what Montreal was at a certain time and through Brian Merrett, we have a sense of how Montreal changed and a sense of the city’s memory and a sense of the city’s past and present taken from his viewpoint. He left us and future generations a record of how we were and how we have changed.”
Taking a straight picture of a tall building is difficult, and Mr. Merrett had specially adapted lenses to eliminate the height distortion. In his regular work, he used 35-mm cameras and a larger format Hasselblad, the camera the astronauts took to the moon.
To capture works of art, he often used an even larger-format camera on a tripod.
In later years, Mr. Merrett split his time between Montreal and North Hatley, in Quebec’s Eastern Townships, in a converted cottage on Lake Massawippi. He was an enthusiastic outdoorsman, and he was involved in local causes, in particular those that involved architecture and development. He established Friends Amis North Hatley Canada (FANHCA). The group recently stopped a condo development in the area.
Bruce McNiven, his friend and fellow founder of Heritage Montreal, said Brian Merrett was modest and self-effacing, though at the same time passionate in his desire to record and preserve buildings in Montreal and throughout Quebec.
“He was never part of the school of general hand-wringing, false nostalgia, and anger about what was lost,” Mr. McNiven said at his memorial service. “He took his camera into battle.”
And Mr. Merrett won many of the battles to preserve older buildings not only in Montreal but also in Senneville, where he grew up, saving an elaborate outbuilding on a 19th-century estate that was being developed.
Mr. Merrett leaves his wife, Ms. Lyman; brother, Tim Merrett; children, Toby and Hannah; stepchildren, Lyman and Jonathan; and three grandchildren.

Growth comes to an urban backwater: Tyndale Green has gotten the go-ahead to intensify a Toronto neighbourhood with an anti-development legacy

Full text: For decades, Bayview Avenue between Lawrence Avenue and the Toronto city limits has been an arterial where both time and traffic seemed to stand still. Even though it is a very busy thoroughfare, there’s been scant redevelopment beyond some clumps of luxury townhouses and the ship-shaped condo that overlooks the Bayview Village mall – a legacy of anti-development councillors and anti-intensification zoning along what remains a largely residential street.
A somewhat unlikely partnership is aiming to alter that narrative with a newly green-lighted plan to significantly intensify 22 acres of the Tyndale University campus, which is situated off Bayview south of Steeles Avenue on a plot of land bounded by ravines that drift down one of the Don River tributaries.
One of the partners is Tyndale, which traces its roots back to the late 19th century and the Toronto Bible Training School. Over decades, it evolved into a degreegranting seminary with a focus on Christian theology, and has owned the former convent site on Bayview since 2015.
The other is Markee Developments, a firm established by former City of Toronto chief planner and mayoral candidate Jennifer Keesmaat and real estate and finance veteran Jason Marks to build affordable housing. Tyndale Green will be their first major venture.
The plan envisions the development of more than 1,500 rental and condo units on land that mostly served as the university’s parking lots as well as a track. The dozen or so proposed buildings will range from six to 24 storeys, with most in the mid-rise range.
The bulk of the rentals, including some family-sized units, are set to lease for 80 to 100 per cent of average market rates, which is the city’s definition of affordable.
The neighbourhood will also be fitted out with a new municipal street, with signalized intersections onto Bayview. Given the lack of nearby amenities, the developers had little choice but to acknowledge the car-oriented realities of the location, yet the entrances to the parking garages have been pushed to the edges of the site so as to discourage internal vehicular traffic.
In Toronto, there are only a few such places – the St. Lawrence neighbourhood and the Canary District – and certainly none in the tall-or-sprawl world of the inner suburbs.
Ms. Keesmaat says Markee’s design team – architects KPMB and landscape designer PFS Studio – is aiming to create a community with extensive pedestrian and open-space links between mid-rise buildings, a shared roadway, a new park and community amenities such as a daycare and a café. While the project includes 1,100 below-grade parking spaces, it will also have 1,500 bike-parking spaces – a nod to the relative isolation of the site, but also the urban aspirations of Ms. Keesmaat’s group.
“It’s more of a European model, but also the kind of model that you would find more in places like Montreal, where there’s a lot of missing middle housing,” she says. “That’s the model that we’re aspiring to inject into the landscape in the city of Toronto, in part because it’s what we’re missing.”
According to project architect Bruno Weber, a partner at KPMB, the buildings themselves will be assembled from modular units that are built in factories and transported to the site. The architecture includes low-carbon construction techniques, wood cladding and the colours and textures of Tyndale’s existing structures, he says.
But the buildings will be slightly closer together than the city’s existing setback policies prescribe. “It’s that public realm and kind of pushing the buildings closer in and creating a public realm that is pedestrian first where people can engage and come together,” Mr. Weber says.
“For us, that’s the most important thing.”
Landscape architect Jennifer Nagai, a partner at PFS Studio, adds that the site also lends itself well to a more creative approach to public space, in large part because the property slopes toward the ravine and the creek, which allows for urban design that uses the site’s topography to its advantage.
“The boundaries of the designated park spaces and the existing landscape are blurred,” she says. “You end up having this very different type of landscape experience where one space leads into another space. Rather than having a compartmentalized approach, it feels more integrated.”
While Ms. Keesmaat’s team has clearly developed a progressiveminded project that ticks off a lot of boxes when it comes to carbon, affordability and new rentals, it’s less clear how Tyndale will connect to its conventionally suburban surroundings and whether this new mixed-use enclave will be regarded as part of the surrounding community or somehow separate.
“I think what we’re trying to do is support movement and connectivity as much as we can within the site and that, hopefully, acts as a catalyst for other things to slowly change and evolve along Bayview,” Ms. Nagai says.
Ms. Keesmaat, who brings a city-planner’s eye to this venture, acknowledges the challenge and points to a conundrum facing developers who want to push the envelope in low-density areas that are facing pressure to intensify.
“There’s a tension, I think, in many Canadian cities around, do you design for the existing condition, even though you know the existing condition is deeply problematic? Or do you start pushing forward towards a future condition? If we imagine in the future that Bayview Avenue has a cycle track and bus rapid transit, then you’re very close to the Steeles BRT to the north, and you’re close to the Sheppard subway, is within a kilometre and a half [south].”
The city’s planning department earlier this month released some new rules that would allow for more as-of-right intensification along so-called “major streets” such as Bayview. Indeed, other similar suburban arterials, such as Bathurst north of Lawrence, have long had more mid-rise buildings, while others, such as Dufferin south of Highway 401, are seeing intensive, high-density projects going up on more conventional sites, such as former car dealerships.
But along all these corridors, a future that includes fewer private vehicles, more bikes, more transit and enough density to support walkable local retail and frequent transit, remains elusive. In the interim, Ms. Keesmaat says, Markee and the university are contemplating a workaround: a private shuttle to the subway until Bayview’s proposed BRT is operational.
As for the overall idea behind Tyndale Green, Ms. Keesmaat argues that it represents an alternative way of adding density to suburban areas. “We kind of assume that the best approach to density is to plunk towers that are sometimes just buildings, right?” she says.
“They’re not communities, they’re just buildings.” With this project, Ms. Keesmaat continues, “We have calibrated very carefully the density, where the density can go, and really put as much density onto the site before we begin compromising [its] sense of place.”

Full text: 3746 Highway 1 ANNA POLIS ROYA L , N . S .
Asking Price: $3,750,000 Taxes: $9,651 (2022) Lot Size: 382.5 acres Agent: Angie Bryant, Sotheby’s International Realty Canada THE BACKSTORY Nicholas Hoare and Margot Stevenson recall the day they peered through the window of a Victorian-era building on Front Street East in Toronto and knew it had the character they were seeking for a new, independent bookstore.
The couple had already established locations beloved by bibliophiles in Montreal. In Toronto, they finished the interior with custom bookcases, a library ladder, a hand-curated selection of books and a comfortable sofa in front of the fireplace.
They opened their doors under the banner Nicholas Hoare in 1989.
Eighteen years ago, Mr. Hoare and Ms. Stevenson began to look toward their eventual retirement. Their challenge at that time was to find a home that could accommodate a collection of books, music, antique furniture and fine art.
“The books weigh literally a ton and we had 20,000 of them,” says Mr. Hoare.
Ms. Stevenson spotted a tiny newspaper ad for a grand stone house sitting on more than 300 acres in Annapolis Royal, N.S.
American industrialist Edwin Fickes had built the house as a safe haven when he saw the storm clouds gathering over Europe between the two world wars.
What caught Ms. Stevenson’s eye was the construction: The monumental building, completed in 1935, had walls fortified by three layers of construction, massive cement footings and tough steel girders supporting all three floors.
“He wasn’t settling for any old house – it had to be virtually bomb proof,” says Mr. Hoare. “It’s a fortress. It’s Gibraltar.”
The couple made a one-day trip to Nova Scotia for a tour of the property.
They found a handsome house with a stone exterior and an interior that looked like a hospital – a very rundown hospital, says Mr. Hoare, explaining that the structure had been left to languish by a previous owner who was mainly interested in the land. Even in a neglected state, the couple could see the building would have the size and heft to support their substantial collections of rarities and first editions – many of which Mr. Hoare inherited from his father, who was a publisher and bookseller in England. “We took one look at it – just like the store in Toronto,” says Mr. Hoare. “We knew this house could be the repository for our bits and pieces.”
The couple delayed the renovation while they remained immersed in reviewing and selling books for a few more years.
As they wound down the business, they shuttered the shops in Montreal and Ottawa. The Toronto flagship closed in 2013.
At that time, the couple moved to Annapolis Royal with their young daughter to tackle the restoration of the house, says Mr. Hoare.
“We brought it out of the mothballs with a vengeance.”
THE HOUSE TODAY The restoration of a building riddled with problems seemed overwhelming, Ms. Stevenson says, recalling their discovery of a puddle of water on one floor and a wall covered in mould. They began by tearing it all apart, then spent more than five years putting it back together.
Along the way, they dug into the home’s history. They learned that Mr. Fickes, a bigwig at aluminum giant Alcoa Inc., in Pittsburgh, had hired a local Nova Scotia architect to create his refuge.
During construction, the architect informed the tycoon that the amount of stone needed wasn’t available for purchase.
“Go and buy the mountain, said Fickes and hung up on him,” recounts Mr. Hoare.
“And they did. They bought the hillside.”
Mr. Hoare adds that the L-shaped structure was divided into two portions, with a main house and separate quarters for servants.
“This maniac decided that he wanted two houses,” says Mr. Hoare. “One of the first things we did was hook up the two.”
The challenge was to find matching stone. Eventually, the couple tracked down a source through a stone mason whose father was one of the 14 masons who worked on the original house.
As the job continued, many of the artisans the couple hired turned out to be descendants of the original craftsmen.
“The whole house is a community effort,” says Ms. Stevenson.
Today the 7,570-square-foot house has five bedrooms and five bathrooms.
Guests arrive to a spacious foyer with a gracious staircase winding up to the landing above. The living room has wood-paneled walls, a fireplace and large bay windows overlooking the grounds.
The main floor also has a kitchen and pantry with painted wood cabinets and open shelves. There’s a large dining room and a library. Upstairs, the five bedrooms have been redesigned with new bathrooms and walk-in closets. There’s also a family room with a beamed ceiling on that level.
The painters spent 18 months transforming the interior with paints imported from Holland, Mr. Hoare says.
Throughout the house, many of the bookshelves and stand-alone cabinets would be familiar to the customers of the Front Street store, he adds.
Outside, the grounds include an apple orchard, woodlands and meadows.
During work on the landscaping, the couple came across mysterious pipes poking up out of the grass.
That’s when they discovered the pipes were the air vents for the labyrinth of cisterns and tunnels to service a bunker Mr. Fickes had built deep underground.
Ms. Stevenson, with a degree in horticulture, has tended herbs, vegetables, perennials and a display of Wisteria.
“You can drop anything in the soil and it grows.”
Testing by the province has shown the rich, loamy soil would be suitable for growing Riesling grapes, the couple adds.
The family often spots wildlife wandering through the 380 acres, including deer, birds and a black bear.
“We have an absolute retinue of beasties,” says Mr. Hoare.
The historic seaside town of Annapolis Royal has a caring community, Ms. Stevenson says, and the Bay of Fundy brings many visitors to the area.
After more than a decade in Nova Scotia, the couple hopes new owners will continue caring for the house and property.
They have decided to move to spend more time with their grown daughter.
Mr. Fickes never actually lived in the house, Mr. Hoare says. He built it in anticipation of world events that never transpired.
“Nobody had the vision to see the sleeping beauty it was,” says Mr. Hoare.
THE BEST FEATURE The second-floor landing includes a private snug where Mr. Hoare has hung a cherished painting. He enjoys settling into a cozy armchair with a selection from the library.
“It’s just a sweet little room.”

Fast-track rezoning to turn farmland into a film studio goes bust

Full text: THE LISTING A developer who received fast-tracked rezoning from Ontario’s government to build a multimillion-dollar film studio in Markham is fighting a lender’s attempts to obtain a court-ordered sale of its assets after it defaulted on a $30-million loan.
The battle is over 99 acres of former farmland on the urban fringe of the Toronto-area suburb. The case highlights the risks that can accompany lightningquick approval of major land deals using Ontario’s ministerial zoning orders (MZO).
In July, 2021, Hong Kong businessman Philip Wong of SOW Capital Ltd. appeared at a virtual meeting of Markham’s electronic development services committee to appeal to the councillors to support his application to the province for an MZO that would allow him and local partner Tung Kee Investment Ltd. Partnership to build a huge movie production studio, hotel and commercial office space at 3143 19th Ave.
Claiming that timing was of the essence because there was a limited window of opportunity to capture a share of the global film production business, and dangling the prospect of creating more than 9,000 jobs, Mr. Wong urged councillors to skip the normal planning process and seek an MZO.
“It wasn’t something where we had a pressing need, it wasn’t affordable housing,” said Jack Heath, a veteran of Markham politics who retired from the regional council in 2022 but voted against the MZO motion in 2021.
“I don’t like MZOs; I don’t believe in them except for really important things such as long-term care. I don’t believe there should be a Queen’s Park planning department where anything big or pressing goes to Queen’s Park and bypasses the municipal planning process” Section 47 of the Planning Act authorizes Ontario’s Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing to issue ministerial zoning orders that essentially allow the minister to take on all the local planning powers the province normally delegates to lower levels of regional or municipal government and redesignate land uses with no possibility of appeal.
It’s essentially a nuclear option that wipes away the normal course of the rules-based system for municipal land planning developed over decades that require land developers to participate in community consultation and environmental studies and offer a basic rationale for their projects.
Since 2018, the Tory government of Doug Ford has issued 108 MZOs, more than all previous governments.
It’s a process that NDP MPP and municipal affairs critic Jeff Burch calls “a mess” and he’s been asking the Auditor General to look into why and how some of these MZOs have been made, often with no transparency.
“Before the Greenbelt scandal really turned the public eye on it in a big way there’s already so much that’s been done, we’re going to be spending the next year discovering all the backroom deals that have been made,” he said.
Despite Mr. Heath’s opposition, Markham’s council did support the film studio MZO. Within a month, former minister of municipal affairs and housing Steve Clark issued the order, Ontario Regulation 599/21, redesignating the agricultural land as commercial.
The One Markham plan proposed to build 3.5 million square feet of office space, film studios, a hotel and retail space. Barely a year later the major lender on the project, Romspen Investment Corp., was seeking an order to obtain power of sale over the lands after Tung Kee missed payments on a $30-million loan.
Romspen is just one of five mortgage lenders on the properties and the combined debt totals more than $65.7-million.
Following unsuccessful attempts to sell the land in early 2023, in July, Romspen applied to the Ontario Superior Court for an order appointing a receiver to begin a sales process for the lands.
In a counteraction filed in August, Tung Kee and SOW Capital filed a claim seeking damages of $120-million from Romspen, whom it alleges scuttled a deal to sell the land.
In its filings, Tung Kee claims if the lands were developed the site would be worth more than $320million, and that Romspen’s attempt to sell the as-yet-undeveloped site for $64.5-million was “improvident” and well below its assessment of the market value.
What’s clear is the land is worth more now that it’s zoned for commercial uses than it was before the MZO was approved.
Indeed, in the marketing materials for the sale Romspen suggested the MZO allows almost any commercial use.
“The bottom line here is this government is issuing MZOs without adequate due diligence,” said Mr. Burch. “Really what should happen is it should be revoked if it’s given out for a specific purpose,” especially if that purpose is null and void, he said.
Mr. Wong was not available to comment. Romspen and its lawyers did not respond to requests for comment.

Vancouver’s hotel shortage piques investor interest: As average room rates reached record highs across Canada this summer, prices in the city hit what some call untenable heights

Full text: Driven by a remarkably strong and sustained rebound in tourism and overnight visitors, Canada’s hotel industry smashed records for average room rates in May, June and again in July, according to CoStar, a global provider of real estate data, analytics and news.
The country’s average daily hotel room rate reached $232 in July – a staggering 29-per-cent increase compared with the prepandemic July, 2019, rate.
“Canada’s hotel industry is benefiting from elevated spending on discretionary services,” says Laura Baxter, director of hospitality analytics for Canada at CoStar Group.
In Vancouver, the city notorious for having Canada’s priciest land and real estate, July hotel room average rates soared to $346, the highest monthly rate ever recorded by a Canadian city.
Vancouver’s hotel occupancy was also the highest among the country’s major markets, at 87 per cent, according to CoStar data.
“Vancouver has incredibly high occupancy because hotel supply is constrained and has been over the past decade,” Ms. Baxter explains.
Vancouver’s record-breaking cruise business this year has also been “a key driver” of hotel rates, Ms. Baxter says. Cruise-ship visits are expected to reach 331 calls carrying up to 1.3 million passengers – many of whom book hotels alongside the cruise.
“It certainly puts a lot of strain on the city’s current hotel capacity,” says Destination Vancouver president and chief executive officer Royce Chwin.
According to a recent economic analysis from Destination Vancouver (formerly Tourism Vancouver), Metro Vancouver needs 20,000 new hotel rooms by 2050.
The report also predicts that within the next three years, the demand for hotel rooms in the city of Vancouver will exceed supply and continue to grow by an average 2.7 per cent a year – with nearly 14 million overnight visitors expected by 2050.
Should the hotel-room shortage persist until 2050, the city will have forgone $31-billion in revenue, $8-billion in taxes and nearly 170,000 jobs, the report states.
Mr. Chwin says repercussions will also include “room rates that continue to go up, forcing some customers to simply go elsewhere. Vancouver will become an unaffordable boutique destination. That worries us from a city brand perspective: We do not want to be an elitist destination.”
Calling its hotel shortage “a dire situation,” Vancouver city council passed a motion in September that directs staff to set targets for new rooms, expedite development applications and update policies that inhibit growth, such as stringent zoning requirements.
(During the same council meeting, councillors voted to hike the Airbnb licensing fee by 800 per cent, from $108 to $1,000 a year. While aiming to increase housing supply, the move could also increase hotel demand by making it too expensive for property owners to operate a shortterm rental business in their home.)
So far, Vancouver’s steep hotel room rates and the prospect of continued growth have piqued the interest of a number of investors, who aim to develop 1,200 rooms by 2027, according to city permit application records.
Notable projects include Vancouver developer Marcon’s rezoning application to build downtown Vancouver’s largest new hotel in more than two decades – a 32-storey, 578-room tower at 516-534 West Pender St.
Hong Kong-owned Paul Y.
Construction, along with Vancouver’s Forme Development and Perkins & Will Architects, is planning a 30-storey downtown hotel tower with 393 guest rooms at 848 Seymour St.
And local developer Amacon aims to transform an office building at 1144 Burrard St. into a boutique-size hotel and is currently constructing another 120-room downtown hotel as part of a mixed-use condominium tower development at Robson and Beatty streets.
In 2021, Bosa Properties purchased a 55-year-old, sevenstorey hotel and attached onestorey pub, located in the downtown-adjacent tech and creative hub of Mount Pleasant, at 888 West Broadway.
The firm originally submitted a proposal to convert the site into a two-tower hotel and office complex because at the time, Bosa was experiencing pandemicrelated occupancy devastation at its other seven-year-old hotel, Element Vancouver Metrotown, and the work-from-home trend had yet to afflict the firm’s office buildings. (The 35-year-old company manages 5.5 million square feet of commercial space and has delivered 10,000 houses.)
Last month, Bosa submitted new plans, swapping out the office space for a full hotel complex of nearly 500 rooms and adding five more storeys.
Marc Ricou, executive vicepresident, commercial and residential, at Bosa Properties, says Vancouver’s wildly successful rebound from pandemic lows and undersupplied market “absolutely” influenced the new plan.
“With the strong performance of our first hotel, we’ve seen in real time how well the industry is doing,” he says. “At the same time, the office market has deteriorated since we purchased the site.”
Even with an estimated cost of $900,000 a room to build the premium hotel – about 40 per cent of which will be designed for extended stays with larger rooms – Mr. Ricou is clearly upbeat about the as-yet-unbranded project.
Market fundamentals bode well for “a great, great investment,” he says.
A search on booking.com in mid-September showed room rates for most premium hotels in Vancouver’s downtown area surpassing $1,200 a night. At that rate, Bosa’s new project could earn roughly $175-million a year, even at 80-per-cent occupancy.
Low-supply and high-rate fundamentals also mean “the city has been very supportive,” Mr. Ricou says. “On this project, in particular, we’ve had a great relationship with the city and planning department, working in a collaborative manner to make the project happen.”

Crombie raises $1-million in Liberal race: Defending developer donations, she says she’s the only candidate who can win against Ford’s fundraising machine

Full text: Bonnie Crombie says she has raised more than $1-million in her bid to lead the Ontario Liberals – the most of any candidate in the party’s history – and is defending donations from developers that have become a frequent line of attack from her opponents.
In a fundraising e-mail sent out Monday, Ms. Crombie fired back at her two main competitors, Nate Erskine-Smith and Yasir Naqvi, who have attempted to paint her as too friendly with big developers for accepting contributions from large donors in the real estate and development industries.
In an appeal to her supporters, she lays out a lengthy defence of the donations, portraying herself as the only contestant who can compete with Premier Doug Ford’s Progressive Conservatives’ fundraising machine and win.
Ms. Crombie – who will take unpaid leave this month from her role as Mississauga mayor – said the third-place Liberal Party needs to regain its financial prowess to be competitive in the 2026 election. She said she may even surpass Mr. Ford’s fundraising total from his 2018 leadership bid, which topped $1.2-million, adding that her campaign has raised nearly double the donations of the other three contenders combined.
In the e-mail, Ms. Crombie said those who have donated to her campaign shouldn’t be criticized for their professions.
“As Leader of the Ontario Liberal Party, I will make certain that our fundraising effort matches Doug Ford’s Conservatives and I will eliminate the huge financial advantage they currently enjoy. I commit to making us competitive again,” she said.
“My success with fundraising has not gone unnoticed by two of the other candidates running to lead our party. Our campaign is being criticized for accepting donations from individuals who want to beat Doug Ford. Some of my donors are being attacked because of what they do for a living.
I reject that criticism and I reject the entire premise of the attacks.”
Ms. Crombie said her bid has followed “all campaign-finance rules. Every single time.” All leadership donations are capped at a maximum of $3,350 and are disclosed publicly, and the names of donors who contributed more than $200 to her campaign are found on the Elections Ontario website. (Her own $1-million figure exceeds the total on that website because it includes more up-to-date figures and smaller donations.) Candidates must also give 25 per cent of their donations to the party, along with a $100,000 entry fee.
“And let me be perfectly clear – if anyone is donating to the Ontario Liberal Party in hopes of another Doug Ford cash-for-access government, they are in for a rude awakening,” she said.
Ms. Crombie added that it “unacceptable” that the PCs are consistently raising 10 times more than the Liberals. The Liberal Party has raised about $600,000 since the beginning of the year, while the PCs took in more than $6-million. Ms. Crombie, however, has personally raised about the same amount of money that the PCs received last quarter.
According to Elections Ontario records, Ms. Crombie received more than $30,000 collectively from 10 people whose names match those of executives at Vaughan-based development company HBNG Holborn Group.
Each gave the maximum $3,350 in late June to mid-July.
And shortly after the donations, she voted on a development application from the company before Mississauga council.
Doing so did not break any rules, but her opponents say she should have recused herself.
Several of the donors had also previously given large amounts to Progressive Conservative candidates, or to Mr. Ford’s 2018 leadership campaign.
Throughout the campaign, Mr. Naqvi and Mr. Erskine-Smith have portrayed these connections as a political liability for the party, which is trying to present an ethical alternative to the PCs in the fallout from Mr. Ford’s failed plan to develop on part of the protected Greenbelt that arcs around the Greater Toronto Area.
In a statement Monday, Mr. Erskine-Smith said successful fundraising is a necessary part of politics, but “there should never even be a perception of improper influence, especially as we look to take on Doug Ford’s corruption.”
“It isn’t an attack to ask Mayor Crombie to explain the $30,000 in co-ordinated donations from 10 execs at one development corporation that had business before her city council, and why she failed to recuse herself,” he said.
In his own statement Monday, Mr. Naqvi said that the next election “will be fought on trust and ethics. Money cannot buy either.”
“I plan to earn the trust of Ontarians with integrity, compassion, and practical, Liberal ideas that will make their lives easier to live,” he said.
Last week, Ms. Crombie’s campaign got a boost when Toronto MPP Adil Shamji endorsed her and dropped out of the race. That leaves four candidates vying for leadership: Ms. Crombie; Mr. Naqvi, an Ottawa MP and former provincial attorney-general; Mr. Erskine-Smith, a Toronto Liberal MP; and Liberal MPP Ted Hsu, who represents Kingston and the Islands.
Party members across the province will vote on a new leader starting in late November, with a winner to be announced in December.

Full text: Bonnie Crombie, the presumed front-runner in the race for leadership of the Ontario Liberal Party, is facing an effort from some of her rivals to portray her as too far to the political right and too friendly with big developers – essentially a gentler version of the province’s Progressive Conservative Premier, Doug Ford.
Ms. Crombie, the mayor of Mississauga, west of Toronto, has raised more money than all the other candidates in the Liberal leadership race combined, amassing a total that exceeds $900,000, according to Elections Ontario. Some of that cash has come from large donors in the real estate and development industries.
That has made her a target. Her rivals have said these connections would be a liability as the party seeks to capitalize on the failings of Mr. Ford, whose links to big landowners, and especially his nowreversed plan to allow them to develop parts of the province’s environmentally protected Greenbelt, have badly bruised his government in recent months.
Ms. Crombie has faced pointed questions on the issue from two leadership candidates: Yasir Naqvi, an Ottawa MP who served as Ontario attorney-general under former premier Kathleen Wynne; and Nate Erskine-Smith, a Toronto MP with a reputation as a maverick backbencher in Ottawa. Mr. Naqvi has called Ms. Crombie “Doug Ford lite” for accepting large donations from developers who have also backed Mr. Ford’s Progressive Conservatives.
The pair have also pointed to Ms. Crombie’s comments over the summer that she would entertain removing land from the Greenbelt if proper consultations were done, and that she thought the party should appeal to the “centre right.” She has since rescinded both statements.
Mr. Naqvi and Mr. ErskineSmith have also accepted donations from developers. And Ms. Crombie has countered that the province’s Liberal Party, which has been struggling to rebuild after being booted out of government in 2018, desperately needs a leader that can raise cash.
Ontario’s Liberals, trounced in the past two general elections and left with just nine seats, will announce the results of their leadership race on Dec. 2. The winner will face Mr. Ford and Official Opposition NDP Leader Marit Stiles in the 2026 provincial election.
The only other remaining candidate in the leadership race is Liberal MPP Ted Hsu. Rookie Toronto MPP Adil Shamji dropped out and endorsed Ms. Crombie on Thursday.
One particular group of donations to Ms. Crombie’s campaign is already providing her critics with additional ammunition.
According to Elections Ontario records, Ms. Crombie received more than $30,000 collectively from 10 people whose names match those of executives at Vaughan-based development company HBNG Holborn Group.
Each gave the maximum $3,350 in late June to mid-July.
Several had also previously given large amounts to Progressive Conservative candidates, or to Mr. Ford’s 2018 leadership campaign.
Corporate donations are not allowed in Ontario, but company executives often donate en masse, and so do members of wealthy families.
HBNG Holborn Group recently had business before Mississauga’s city council. On Aug. 1, Ms. Crombie voted in favour of a settlement on a proposal by the developer for a multitower high-rise complex in the heart of Mississauga, where a YMCA centre is now located, right across from city hall.
The project, which had been set to go to the province’s land tribunal, involves converting a road to a pedestrian walkway. The city had initially balked at this, but the deal was ultimately okayed by city planners and unanimously approved by council. The company did not respond to a request for comment.
Mississauga’s code of ethics does not consider political donations gifts that would put a politician in a conflict of interest. But Ms. Crombie’s leadership rivals are still calling the vote inappropriate.
Mr. Erskine-Smith said in an interview that while he doesn’t know all the details, Ms. Crombie should have recused herself to avoid any suggestion of an apparent conflict.
“Doug Ford’s weakness is integrity. And it should be our greatest strength. And we are not going to beat Doug Ford if we are vulnerable to similar accusations and if there’s the appearance of impropriety,” he said.
Mr. Naqvi was not available for an interview. In a statement, his campaign director, Milton Chan, said it is “unethical” and “should be unlawful” for politicians to accept large donations from people who stand to benefit from decisions they make or directly influence.
Ms. Crombie declined an interview request. Taylor Deasley, a spokesperson for her campaign, said in an e-mail that the mayor has “strictly adhered” to all city and Elections Ontario rules and has “no knowledge of the thousands of individual donors” who have given money to her leadership campaign.
“If anyone is donating to my campaign or to the Ontario Liberal Party in the hopes of another Doug Ford cash-for-access government, they are in for a rude awakening,” Ms. Crombie said in a statement.
Both Mr. Erskine-Smith and Mr. Naqvi have said they would use the power of the premier’s office to strengthen election-finance rules. Mr. Naqvi has said he would bring back a provision, repealed by Mr. Ford, that required donors to attest that they were giving their own money, not their employers’, to discourage the circumvention of the ban on corporate donations.
Mr. Erskine-Smith acknowledges having received leadership campaign contributions from at least two people in the development industry: $3,350 from Mitchell Cohen, president and chief executive officer of Daniels Corp., and another $3,350 from Mr. Cohen’s son Jacob.
Mr. Erskine-Smith has said he went to high school with the younger Mr. Cohen, and has called him a long-time friend.
Cuckoo Kochar, founder and president of Phoenix Homes, an Ottawa-area developer, hosted a fundraiser for Mr. Naqvi in June, according to an invitation obtained by The Globe and Mail. Mr. Kochar, a prolific donor to both Liberal and Progressive Conservative causes, gave Mr. Naqvi’s campaign $1,000, the Elections Ontario database says.
Mr. Chan, Mr. Naqvi’s campaign director, said in a statement that the difference is that Mr. Naqvi was not in a position to directly influence decisions affecting any developers.
“The ethical problem arises when politicians accept large donations from individuals when they can directly influence decisions that would bring huge financial windfall to their donors’ businesses,” Mr. Chan said.
