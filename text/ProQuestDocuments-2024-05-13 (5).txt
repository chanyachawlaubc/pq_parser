Full text: The Other Black Girl BY ZAKIYA DALILA HARRIS, ATRIA, 288 PAGES Every summer has a "hot" book - the one that everyone is talking about, reading and recommending. This year that book is The Other Black Girl and, if you haven't already got a copy, you may find your local bookseller is already sold out even though the book was only released this month.
One part of this excellent debut is a dig at the polite white world of publishing, a world Harris spent years in while at Knopf Doubleday. Her central character is Nella Rogers, the underpaid assistant to a star editor. Nella has paid her dues and then some, but her goal - a senior editorial position - is still far away. Meanwhile, she keeps a smile on her face, polite lies on her lips and ignores the daily microaggressions that are part of being the only Black person in the office. Suddenly, a new Black woman appears. Nella fantasizes about lunches and gossip and shared beauty secrets but Hazel seems to have all the confidence that Nella lacks, along with the Harlem history and innate cool. Then a mysterious letter arrives, telling Nella to leave the company. And Hazel, the Other Black Girl, seems to be a foe, not a friend.
Harris darts from past to present, to recent present, and I'd advise you to pay attention to the dates at the chapter headings. There are also three female narrators and Harris plays fast and loose with the rules of the genre. And yes, like every other reviewer, I agree that the plot owes a bit to Jordan Peele's Get Out, but otherwise the originality and the verve are all Harris's own.
When She Was Good BY MICHAEL ROBOTHAM, SPHERE, 404 PAGES Michael Robotham's forte is a dive into the darkest and most damaged minds. His long-time series featuring clinical psychologist Joe O'Loughlin led readers into some gory cases.
But it was Cyrus Haven, the forensic psychologist featured in Good Girl, Bad Girl, that caught readers' attention and now, Haven returns in a sequel that's smarter and even more frightening than his first case.
The story begins when Haven meets the policewoman who rescued a child from a house of horror six years before. The child, aged 6, was filthy and had been locked in a box. She was the only witness to the murder of two people in the room where she was kept. Six years later, she has never revealed a snippet of what occurred to her before.
She's currently in a secure children's home, the location completely secret. The policewomen tells him that revealing anything about little Evie Cormac and those events years ago means death. Someone wants Evie shut up permanently and people who protect her, who inform on her, who connect with her, die.
The murders and the abuse of Evie are enough to arouse Haven's professional interest but he's also caught up in the girl's silence. Robotham never lets up on the suspense here, and the Haven's intensity as well as Evie's guarded innocence make for unforgettable characters.
With all that, the story will still lead to nightmares.
Definitely Robotham's best to date.
Girl A BY ABIGAIL DEAN, VIKING, 342 PAGES This debut from an English author is also a contender for Book of the Summer and it deserves every kudo it's received so far. This novel is a brilliant and provocative character study of a woman who survived a terrible childhood trauma. What does become of those children we see on the news who are rescued from houses filled with trash, filth and misery?
Girl A is Lex Gracie. We first meet her on her way to Her Majesty's Prison to deal with the death of her mother who, surprisingly, for a woman incarcerated for 15 years, had an estate. She leaves money and her house to her children.
Lex is in charge of disposing of the assets and getting her siblings' assent. The money is no problem, obviously, but the house is another matter. This is the "House of Horror" that Lex and her siblings escaped from. Starved, abused, chained, the Gracie children were front page news for months. All were adopted by different families, a decision made by the state, and have had very different lives. What to do with the house that nobody wants? Lex and her sister will decide and then get the rest of the siblings to agree.
That's the basic plot of this superb book.
The mystery here is why did any of this happen? What happened to the parents in this family? Why did they decide to chain and starve their children? As Lex goes to each sibling in turn, each has a different story, adding a layer to the history of the Gracie family. Dean takes her time but keeps the suspense going, even though the "crime" was committed years before. You will want to read this one over a weekend.
Blood Grove BY WALTER MOSLEY, LITTLE, BROWN, 308 PAGES Reviewers have exhausted the superlatives for Walter Mosley's Easy Rawlins series. Set in South Central Los Angeles in the years after the Second World War, with a group of unforgettable and brilliantly crafted continuing characters, Mosley's books are not just a series of novels but the history of a place and time when Black lives were on the edge of change. Ezekiel (Easy) Rawlins, the man who solves local problems, remains one of the best-ever investigators in the mystery genre.
This episode in Easy's life takes us to 1969. The first case through the door of Easy's small private investigation firm is a young Vietnam vet with a strange tale. He and a girlfriend were attacked in a local orange grove. He may have killed a man and now the woman and his dog are missing.
Easy doesn't usually take white clients, but he's a veteran, too, and so he decides to help. and that leads him on a strange, and very Sixties, journey.
At the same time, Easy's personal life is under threat.
His adopted daughter Feather's white relative has been around and Feather is now a young woman with ideas of her own about her life. Will she follow the path Easy has paved for her or break his heart? With its wonderful backdrop and the intense historical tension, Mosley weaves a magic story that will stay with you long after you close the book.
Dream Girl BY LAURA LIPPMAN, HARPERCOLLINS, 320 PAGES Laura Lippman is a writer I look forward to reading and, with Dream Girl, she doesn't disappoint. After a dozen in her Tess Monaghan series, and another dozen standalone novels, she still keeps the prose fresh and plots original.
Dream Girl is the latest and one of the best of her psychological suspense novels.
Gerry Anderson is a bestselling novelist and he has the house and the bankroll to prove it. He's just moved back to his native Baltimore to look after his dying mother but Mom dies quickly and Gerry, showing off his fancy new penthouse, takes a bad fall. He's confined to bed for weeks. He has a night nurse and a smart young assistant but Gerry is having problems and, worst of all, telephone calls from a woman who claims to know him. But the woman who's calling never existed. She was the main character in Gerry's bestselling novel, Dream Girl. Is any of this real or is it a drug-induced fantasy? If it's real, why would anyone want to become a fictional character in Gerry's life?
Lippman pulls out all the stops in this book and you have to pay attention to see what's really happening. Just as in Stephen King's Misery, things are not what they seem.
The Royal Secret BY ANDREW TAYLOR, HARPERCOLLINS, 467 PAGES People often ask me for a list of my favourite authors. Andrew Taylor's name is always in the first five. I've been hooked on his books since I read The American Boy years ago and I still regard his trilogy beginning with The Scent of Death as one of the most interesting, as well as historically accurate, depictions of New York during the American Revolution I've read. That said, I love this series, which features characters Cat Hakesby and James Marwood. It is an incredible portrait of London after the Great Fire. Dirt, grime, gold, glitter - Taylor serves up all of it. And when I say 400-plus pages is just long enough, I mean it.
We are in Book 5 and the simmering and strange relationship between Marwood and Hakesby continues to wax and wane but a trip to the theatre always gets them together. If you haven't read the previous four books, you will want to, although it's not necessary to understand what's happening here. Cat has taken on her late husband's architectural business and opened an office on Slaughter Street. Marwood has his investigative talents in the service of the State. Cat has been asked to design a poultry house for royalty. Marwood has to protect a secret that can take down the English throne.
In short, we have the last years of the 17th-century as London rises from the ashes and heads to the world stage.
Taylor has everything a showman could ask, including a caged tiger waiting for a chance to kill. Great fun and perfect summer getaway reading.

Full text: Earlier this month, the Toronto-based developer Hullmark cut the ribbon on a modest 45-unit mid-rise project in Leslieville, a development that had been three years in the making.
Because the building is situated on an intimate stretch of Queen Street East, with singlefamily homes behind, the company had to adhere to a city urbandesign policy known as the MidRise Guidelines. These don't pack the regulatory punch of formal zoning or official plan regulations, but nonetheless impose "performance standards" on such projects. Those frequently involve inclined step-backs - or "articulations" - on both the frontand rear-facing sides to prevent shadows and perceived privacy intrusions (known in planning parlance as "overlook"), while creating a visual transition to lowrise neighbourhoods.
If builders want to avoid a protracted fight with the city or local homeowners, they try to adhere to these guidelines. In this case, senior vice-president of development Leona Savoie says, Hullmark met 98 per cent of the expectations, which are itemized in a detailed document last updated by the planning department in 2016.
Yet, according to Ms. Savoie, the company encountered a quirk in these non-regulatory regulations. While the Mid-Rise Guidelines are ostensibly a citywide policy, council approved a bespoke version just for Leslieville.
Hullmark officials then looked at some of its other landholdings on West Queen West and discovered the planning department is working on a similarly localized version for that area.
"That was the first time we encountered a new neighbourhoodbased guideline that took precedent over the citywide policy," she says.
While these revelations may sound like the development industry's version of inside-baseball, they hint at an increasingly untenable economic dilemma embedded in the city's longstanding vision for intensification, and therefore its ability to create new housing.
For well over two decades, Toronto's official plan has called for transit-oriented intensification along the "Avenues," much of it expected in the form of mid-rise apartments that can be approved "as of right" - meaning without zoning or official plan appeals.
Such buildings are often seen as more livable and human scale than 50- or 60-storey towers.
Yet, ironically, the highly prescriptive Mid-Rise Guidelines - combined with skyrocketing land, labour and building costs, as well as timelines that can run to six years for a mid-sized building - have turned these projects into pyramid-shaped unicorns, often filled with deep, dark and narrow units dubbed "bowling alleys."
"The economics are so frail," says architect Dermot Sweeny, founding principal of Sweeny & Co., who describes the angular plane requirements as "a massive cost" because they make the structure more complicated and expensive while reducing the amount of leasable or saleable floor space.
Other builders agree. "The Mid-Rise Guidelines have fallen short in what the city intended to do to provide more housing," says Josh Kaufman, Starlight Investments' vice-president, development and construction.
The critiques extend beyond the industry. Professor of architecture Richard Sommer, former dean of the John H. Daniels Faculty of Landscape, Architecture and Design at the University of Toronto, describes the controls in the guidelines as "very crude."
"They're built around a mindset of deference to low-rise communities."
Consequently, while Toronto has seen a continent-leading boom in very tall towers in growth nodes such as King West and Yonge/Eglinton, the development of mid-rises along arterials has lagged for years. According to statistics gathered by Urban Nation, the proportion of new condos in buildings under 12 storeys, compared with the total across all building heights, has inched up slightly in the past decade. But over all, only about 8 per cent to 10 per cent of all condos built in the City of Toronto - about 8,000 as of the first quarter of 2021 - are located in mid-rises, with the balance in 12- to 19-storey buildings or towers above 20 floors. (Even in the 905, where land is cheaper, projects under 12 storeys also account for the smallest number of new units by building size category.)
The unintended consequences - among them the push by builders for more height and density on constrained sites - should be on the city's radar as the planning department embarks on a major overhaul of the Official Plan, planning experts and industry insiders say. As Prof. Sommers wonders, "How do we get out of this lock?" Toronto's fraught relationship with mid-rises is something of an anomaly. In many economically vibrant North American cities, such as Seattle, Portland, Boston and even New York, mid-rise apartments in the past decade became the fastest-growing mode of residential development, according to data compiled by RentCafé, a U.S. rental site. A few Google searches reveal that many of these projects are quite conventional in form - upright boxes or wider, lower-slung buildings that have drawn some criticisms for their architectural homogeneity.
Prof. Sommer points out that the core of many of those cities are denser because the main streets have seen cycles of intensification, whereas Toronto's avenues are still lined with first-generation two-storey "mercantile" buildings, many of which are being designated as heritage structures.
In cities such as Denver, midrise apartment projects have been identified as good candidates for mass timber construction as an alternative to carbonintensive materials such as steel and concrete, while a growing number of green developers are looking to use Passive House standards in mid-rises.
In fact, Hullmark - which has developed a pair of tall timber office buildings in Liberty Village - looked in to using wood for a possible mid-rise condo on Queen, but quickly discovered that it wasn't structurally feasible with the required step-back form.
"The articulation isn't conducive to timber construction," says Ms. Savoie, who noted this problem to the planning department but didn't get a response.
Mr. Sweeny adds that the stepped-back shape also tends to make mid-rise buildings less energy efficient and more prone to heat loss - a performance issue that seems to run counter to the city's climate goals.
Industry executives such as Mr. Kaufman have long advocated for various fixes in the policy framework, from relaxed parking requirements for such projects to financial incentives such as lower development charges and even a specialized unit in the planning department that deals just with mid-rise projects to ensure they don't take so long to get approved.
But planning consultant Brent Toderian, former City of Vancouver chief planner, says mid-rise reform must go beyond the policy specifics, and ensure that the broader city building principles enshrined in official plans aren't illusory. "Viability is critically important."
Good urban design shouldn't just focus narrowly on problems such as sidewalk shadows and homeowner privacy, he says; it must address and balance broader goals, such as carbon reduction, housing affordability and transit-oriented development.
"The truth is, we're not balancing," Mr. Toderian says. "We're prioritizing detached housing."

KINGSTON'S EXPERIMENT WITH DENSITY BY DESIGN

Full text: Before the City of Kingston last updated its official plan, a Toronto planning consultant had recommended appending midrise design guidelines right in the document. As with many municipalities in Southern Ontario, these were modelled directly on the City of Toronto's rules.
Problem was, they didn't take.
Local developers didn't like the 45-degree angular plane required by the policy, which was targeted initially for a transit- and pedestrian-oriented mid-town neighbourhood called Williamsville. They fought instead to build higher structures in an area where the city wanted four- to six-storey intensification along a main street. Those official plan rules created "building profiles that looked like an Egyptian pyramid," says Paige Agnew, Kingston's commissioner of community services and chief planner.
One of the pain points, she adds, is that such structures didn't allow for wood-frame construction, which has been identified as a way of reducing carbon in a municipality that has declared a climate emergency.
The city retained planning consultant Brent Toderian to help come up with a made-in-Kingston policy framework, now under development, that ticks all the boxes.
"What Kingston understood is that good urban design implements all your public-policy goals," he says. "Kingston has started the process of getting out of the business of angular plans." As he adds: "A tool may not be working for a long time, but the city can keep using it."

Full text: THE LISTING When it comes to buying a home in most major markets in Canada, knowing how to navigate a multiple offer scenario is critical.
Realtors in the country's most active market, Toronto, say buyers are feeling the pinch.
Thousands of buyers know the cold reality of on-the-ground buying and selling. In a year in which almost every month has seen new records set, sales dipped slightly in Toronto in May, to 11,951, but prices set another high, with the average sale price for all home types up by 28.4 per cent yearover-year, to touch $1,108,453.
"As a realtor, we don't like this either, it's not fun," said Mark Savel with Sage Real Estate Ltd., who last week represented buyers in a seven-way bidding war. "We all lost: The sellers didn't accept any of the offers."
Buyers report being priced out in bidding wars in even traditionally "affordable" Ontario markets such as Brantford and Paris.
There's also a good deal of secrecy: Buyers are not allowed to know, even after the fact, what the other offers were.
For many agents, it comes down to a careful analysis of the local market and a keen understanding of the process. "The first thing people ask me is, ‘What is your seller's expectation, what are they willing to take?,' " said Andre Kutyan, a broker with the Robert Greenberg Team at Harvey Kalles Real Estate Ltd. and frequent listing agent.
"I say, ‘I have no expectations.' I acknowledge [the house] is aggressively priced below market value; it's just a question of how much."
To shed some light on how the process actually goes, Mr. Kutyan agreed to take The Globe and Mail behind the scenes of a recent multiple offer situation as a way to show buyers what the sellers see.
The actual house address will not be identified, nor the identity of the sellers or bidders. Some of the dollar amounts have also been altered. But what follows is a blowby-blow account of what works and what doesn't in a residential real estate blind auction.
OFFER DAY 11:30 a.m.: The first bid comes in a downtown Toronto house, a twostorey, three-bedroom detached in a popular neighbourhood listed at just more than $1.249-million.
The listing price is purely notional and few see it as a true estimate of the house's market value.
Mr. Kutyan, the agent for the sellers, has forwarded website traffic and social-media reports to them that show thousands of views on the listing and that it has booked more than 40 showings. Most of this work is digital now, and using services such as BrokerBay allows buyers' agents to see how busy the visiting schedule is: If all available times are booked on a given day, that's a sign there's intense interest.
The deadline for submitting bids has been put at 3 p.m., but an early bid has come in, which suggests to Mr. Kutyan the buyer is eager. The bid is $1.535-million, with a closing date in one month.
That's right around what Mr. Kutyan expected to be the starting point for the true value of this listing. The bid comes with proof of a certified deposit cheque that's above the industry minimum of 5 per cent of asking, which leads Mr. Kutyan to believe this buyer has space to increase their bid.
That's also his first tip for bidders: "If I'm going to do a deal, I want that cheque to my office before the end of the business day - I don't want to leave any loose ends."
1:36 p.m.: A second bid arrives and it's close: $1.51-million, with a closing in three months. Deposit cheque attached, also above the minimum, but not as much as the first offer. The conditions include a request to warranty appliances until shortly after closing, something Mr. Kutyan communicates back as a non-starter.
2:54 p.m.: The third bid arrives, for $1.515-million, closing in two months. The deposit is virtually identical to offer No. 2. The initial bid was changed to add $5,000, perhaps Mr. Kutyan speculates, because they saw other registered offers. "Another thing I tell people is to come with your best offer first, don't assume you're going to get a second round. Unless offers are close, there's no reason for me to start sending them back," he said.
2:55 pm: The fourth bid is low: $1.35-million, with exactly a 5-percent deposit, but it comes with another feature of the hot market: A personal letter from the bidders.
It's an attractive young couple talking about their new family and love of the neighbourhood.
"Usually I'll get at least one warm and fuzzy letter. Sometimes they are the winner, sometimes not," said Mr. Kutyan, who shares such letters with the sellers, but has rarely seen them sway a decision if the offer wasn't also just right. "I hate to debunk that myth, but it's a money thing. No seller is going to leave money on the table.
Unless the difference is so nominal; it could be a couple thousand dollars at most."
4:45 p.m. Bid No. 5 comes in long after the deadline and it's an outlier in terms of price: $1.28-million, with no deposit cheque and includes conditions on buyer financing and an inspection clause, despite the inspection provided by Mr. Kutyan.
"This bid is going nowhere.
They are taking a kick at the can, but if they are genuine buyers they have no idea what's going on," he said. Comparable properties in the area sold for the $1.5million price Mr. Kutyan is targeting. As for coming in late? "It never fails. There's always one. For some people, it's a strategy: ‘I'm going to wait to see how many offers are registered before I make an offer.' " Other times, he said, it's just incompetence.
DECISION TIME, ALMOST With offers in hand and reviewed, Mr. Kutyan presents them all to his clients, highlighting what concerns he has: the lack of a deposit in one case, the extra conditions in another. He has also spoken to the agents representing the top three bids, feeling them out as he prepares for the possibility of sending them back for improvement.
"Some agents will ask, ‘How many rounds are you planning on doing?' These questions lead me to believe they have more money," Mr. Kutyan said. "I'm not working for the buyer.
"At the end of the day, I'm going to do everything I can to squeeze every last drop out of this deal, within reason. What I've done here is I've told my clients: ‘We've achieved already what our estimate of value is. The question is, can we get more money?' " The sellers agree to give it a try, the worst-case scenario being the current top offer stands pat or rescinds, in which case they have two offers above $1.5-million to consider. And Mr. Kutyan sends the top three bidders back. The warm and fuzzy letter couple wasn't close enough to get a formal invitation, but he communicates to the agent they can resubmit if they like. "I'll make them understand: They are welcome to do so, but they are going to have to come up significantly in order to have a chance."
6:03 p.m. The first offer in at 11:30 a.m. is the first offer to resubmit, jumping to $1.61-million. The other two offers also come back. Offer 3 ups the bid to $1.515-million. The second offer has stood pat, changing nothing but shaving some days off closing.
The first bid came with a request for the seller to finish repairs found in the home inspection. Mr. Kutyan had communicated to the agent this was the only bid with a repairs clause among those he asked to come back. As a result, the bidder has also dropped the repair request. So, even though they are already in the lead on price, they have also relinquished a major condition to their offer. They are, in effect, bidding against themselves.
This, critics say, is one of the main downsides of the closed bidding system; bidders have no idea when enough is enough. Mr. Kutyan said the sellers had been prepared to take buyer No. 1's initial offer if no one else improved theirs.
"At this point, there's nothing else to talk about. I tell my sellers to sign on the dotted line and run," Mr. Kutyan said.
"People get really angry; they think I'm pushing the price up.
‘Some crazy person just paid $350,000 over asking!' Yeah, they did. But the market value of the house was already over $1.5-million. In reality, the buyer coughed up 5 per cent more than the rest.
Which isn't crazy."
The keys for success are fairly simple, according to Mr. Kutyan: Make an offer with no conditions; have a deposit cheque in hand; make your best bid first - don't expect a second round. And if it doesn't happen, it's not because you didn't write a nice enough letter.

Full text: Real estate developer Mattamy Homes, known as a force in the suburbs, wants to meet soaring demand for homes in the Toronto area by building up, along with out.
Mattamy, a Toronto-based company that became North America's largest privately owned builder by focusing on singlefamily homes, is launching a dedicated high-rise development division on Thursday.
The new business, branded as Mattamy GTA Urban, will initially focus on creating what chief executive Brad Carr calls "vertical communities" that combine mid- and high-rise housing with retail, office and public space in the Greater Toronto Area.
Over time, Mattamy plans to expand this arm of the business.
The company also operates in Ottawa, Edmonton, Calgary and 11 U.S. markets.
While Mattamy is best known for single-family homes, it has built more than 40 high-rise and multifamily home projects over the past four decades. The new urban division represents a heightened commitment to high-rise living.
The division will initially build on land Mattamy already owns in Toronto and outlying centres such as Brampton, Mississauga and Richmond Hill - a land bank that Mr. Carr said will sustain the company for at least five years.
"Multifamily mid- and highrise housing is a core component of future development in the GTA, as Canada's largest urban centre looks to provide increased supply of housing and livable communities while keeping the Greenbelt intact," Mr. Carr said in an interview.
Mattamy plans to build both condos and rental units to serve a region that is expected to see its population grow from 6.4 million to eight million by the year 2030.
"The Canadian government has made it clear that a central element of their pandemic response is going to be increased immigration, and we know that a great many of those new Canadians will want to be in the Toronto area, which will only increase the demand for affordable homes," Mr. Carr said. Mattamy, controlled by billionaire Peter Gilgan, is currently talking to potential financial and commercial backers for its new high-rise projects.
Mattamy currently sells 2,500 to 3,000 homes each year in the GTA, and Mr. Carr said the urban division is expected to build about the same number of units, doubling the company's annual local output. Mattamy hired David Stewart, former president of Canadian communities at rival Minto Group Inc., to run the new division. Mr. Stewart started his career at Mattamy and left for Minto 10 years ago.
"We are building off an already strong base of multistorey projects across the GTA, and we have an ambitious growth plan to expand that portfolio significantly in the short to medium term," Mr. Stewart said.
The condo market, which is the key component of Mattamy's urban expansion strategy, is bouncing back in Toronto after sales slowed last spring during the early days of the pandemic.
In the first three months of this year, the average sale price of a new condo in the GTA was $817,000, up from $770,000 a year ago, according to data service Urbanation. During the same period, the average price for a resale single-family home in the GTA went over $1-million for the first time, according to the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board.
Shaun Hildebrand, president of Urbanation, attributes the Toronto condo market's strength to low borrowing costs and renewed optimism among buyers. In a press release, he said that suburban home prices "soared 30 per cent over the past year and put the spotlight back on urban properties." New condominium apartment sales in the GTA totaled 5,385 units in the first quarter of 2021, close to prepandemic levels.

Full text: Property technology, or proptech, is one of the fastest-growing areas for commercial AI. Here are three ways AI, machine learning and big data are transforming the industry: PROPERTY VALUATION Accurate valuation is the backbone of any real-estate transaction, but the number of variables involved can be dizzying; location, age, building condition and a host of external conditions.
A growing number of platforms are helping buyers and sellers analyze the enormous number of relevant data points to arrive at better valuations - so many that companies are now finding unique twists to distinguish themselves from the competition. Take OfficeBlocks, developed by global commercial real estate company JLL: Its Market Intelligence App can analyze a photo of a property, use a machine-learning algorithm taught by thousands of other photos, and generate estimated rent per square foot.
PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT A suite of new platforms has come to market in recent years to help pinpoint emerging investment opportunities, highlight portfolio risks or even manage rental stock. New Yorkbased Skyline AI, for example, analyzes local demographics and real estate transaction data to develop a prediction algorithm that forecasts trends and emerging investment opportunities.
More controversially, rental managers have begun using tenant-screening tools for residential real estate, analyzing everything from social media to legal history to algorithmically score prospective tenants - a practice that critics say risks entrenching existing biases.
GOODBYE REAL ESTATE AGENT?
Residential real estate is already well along the path to technological transformation. Online listings and sites such as Zoocasa have already made it easier for buyers to access market information without a realtor. And now AI is closing in.
Companies such as OpenDoor, known as iBuyers, use AI models to price residential properties for fast sales. Online real estate marketplace Zillow has recently gotten into this arena as well, and other companies are working on technology that can help buyers find properties as well as human realtors. In 2016, an experiment pitted real estate brokers in Colorado against an AI, to see which would find the best homes for clients. The robots won.

Full text: One day before his world started falling apart, before he seemingly disappeared from public view, leaving inquiries from lawyers unanswered, Sean McCoshen had some politicians to impress.
He appeared before a virtual meeting of a House of Commons transportation committee on April 29 to talk about a dream of his: building a railroad from Fort McMurray to the ports of Alaska.
It might seem quixotic, but former U.S. president Donald Trump issued a permit last year allowing the rail line to cross the border, and Alberta Premier Jason Kenney welcomed the approval. Plus, Mr. McCoshen had lined up funding to get him started. Bridging Finance Inc., a Torontobased private lender to riskier borrowers, had put some $200-million into Mr. McCoshen's company, Alaska-Alberta Railway Development Corp.
(A2A).
He considered Bridging CEO David Sharpe to be a close friend - so close they referred to one another as "brother" when talking on the phone.
They'd worked side-by-side for years. Mr. McCoshen introduced Bridging to Indigenous communities in need of financing, while Bridging made its single largest loan to A2A. The railway company has even described Mr. Sharpe as a co-founder, and he travelled with Mr. McCoshen to Washington, D.C., in 2019 to lobby officials, including former vice-president Mike Pence.
Both men pitched the railway as a transformational endeavour - a sure-fire way to get Albertan oil and other commodities to global markets, and a boon for Indigenous communities through ownership stakes.
That was important to them, and the reason Mr. Sharpe, a member of the Mohawks of the Bay of Quinte, got involved in the first place. Mr. McCoshen, while not Indigenous, has described himself as an "advocate of Canada's Indigenous population."
On the day he appeared before MPs, Mr. McCoshen told the committee the railway could be a model of sustainability and aspired to be the largest co-owned Indigenous infrastructure project in the world. "That is the kind of project Canada should be building right now, and we can absolutely do this," he said.
It was the last time Mr. McCoshen has been seen or heard from publicly in nearly two months. The following day, an Ontario court put Bridging Finance into receivership, following an investigation by the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC). The regulator said it discovered numerous financial irregularities and alleged the company improperly used investor funds to benefit its founders and executives. Mr. McCoshen, a businessman from Winnipeg, has emerged as a central figure amid the fallout.
Last week, Bridging's receiver alleged that millions of dollars slated for Mr. McCoshen's railway company were transferred into his personal bank account. Millions more appear to have gone to a numbered company he controlled. The receiver, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC), has been "unable to determine the commercial relationship" between that company and A2A.
Money allegedly flowed the other way, too.
The OSC alleges Mr. McCoshen transferred $19.5million to Mr. Sharpe, with some of those deposits coming just days after Bridging extended loans to his companies. Under questioning by the OSC, Mr. Sharpe denied the payments were kickbacks - they were loans, he said. Neither he nor Mr. McCoshen has produced a loan agreement.
Exactly who Mr. McCoshen is and how he became so entwined in Bridging's affairs is a pressing question for the lender's 26,000 retail investors. He and his companies have ties to some of Bridging's biggest and most troubled loans - more than $500-million worth, about one-quarter of the firm's assets under management - whether as the recipient, guarantor or broker.
Bridging's CEO has portrayed Mr. McCoshen as a savvy, jet-setting businessman. "Sean McCoshen is a person that has a lot of money and does well," Mr. Sharpe told the OSC in April.
It certainly seems that way, at first. Mr. McCoshen owns millions in real estate, rubs shoulders with billionaires, and says he has stakes in multiple companies through his firm, the McCoshen Group. According to his corporate biographies, he spent nearly two decades in finance and infrastructure development before brokering loans for First Nations.
But a Globe and Mail investigation has found Bridging has tied its fortunes - and investors' money - to someone with a record of business failures and a vague, unverifiable résumé. One of Mr. McCoshen's companies filed for bankruptcy, and seven years ago, he said his personal finances were "on a knife's edge," according to court records. As for his work with First Nations, controversy has followed him from community to community, with accusations of kickbacks and exorbitant, unexplained fees.
Mr. Sharpe did not answer a long list of questions from The Globe about his relationship with Mr. McCoshen, and instead issued a statement through his lawyer, Melissa MacKewn. "As a First Nations person, Mr. Sharpe stands by his track record of economic reconciliation in this country," according to the statement. "Mr.
Sharpe will respond to the OSC's unfounded allegations at the appropriate time and in the proper forum, rather than arguing their merits in the media."
Mr. McCoshen, meanwhile, has said nothing at all. He did not respond to multiple e-mails from The Globe. PwC, the receiver, has tried to question him directly, but was told by his lawyer that he's unavailable owing to medical reasons.
PwC also asked for proof that Mr. McCoshen is too ill to respond. So far, it has not received any evidence.
As Bridging's investors await more information about the fate of their investments, the revelations about Mr. McCoshen's tumultuous career raise serious questions about the due diligence Bridging performed before lending millions to his company, the company's internal controls, and how closely it monitored the use of those funds. Underlying it all is just what opportunity David Sharpe saw when he got into business with Sean McCoshen - a chance to help First Nations and build infrastructure, or something else entirely.
At a glance, Mr. McCoshen is the picture of a successful entrepreneur. He travels via private jet and owns luxury properties in three countries valued at some $26-million. He has wealthy acquaintances, too, including Vancouver billionaire Francesco Aquilini. Last year, the pair helped organize a virtual fundraiser for Conservative Party Leader Erin O'Toole. A spokesperson for Mr. Aquilini confirmed the two know each other, but declined an interview.
At 53, Mr. McCoshen has a voice like a rock tumbler. He sports long, wavy hair and occasionally dresses like a monied, aging musician, with stylishly ripped jeans and a leather jacket (in his younger days, he actually did play in a Winnipeg rock band). He has a taste for higherend brands, favouring Tom Ford and Gucci, and liked to boast about his financial acumen. During one period of his career, after a business win, he'd ask aloud, "Why am I so good?" He was born in Nova Scotia before his family moved to Winnipeg, and he later graduated from the University of Western Ontario with a law degree. According to the various biographies that have appeared on his company websites over the years, he practised law in Winnipeg and described himself as a "securities lawyer turned investment banker."
He's said he worked "in conjunction with" private equity firms, participating in US$35-billion worth of financings, while another bio said he worked as managing director of an infrastructure fund. He told a business publication he once spent three years with a multinational private equity firm building a grain terminal in the United Arab Emirates. The area was home to Bedouin tribes who required extensive consultation. "It was two years of getting everybody to agree and then one year of construction, and I became very sensitized to the differences of culture," he said.
While his bios are laudatory ("Sean is a shining example of what can be realized through intelligence, personality, determination and extremely hard work," reads one), what's typically missing is any detail on where, exactly, he has worked. Mr. Sharpe evidently had no doubts about his business partner's bona fides. He told the OSC during an interview that Mr. McCoshen was a former employee of Carlyle Group, the US$260-billion global private equity company, in Washington. But a spokesperson for Carlyle said the company has no record of Mr. McCoshen ever being an employee.
That's not the only oddity in his career. One bio states he retired from banking in 2007 after 18 years. That would mean he started in the field around 1989, at the age of 22, before he earned his law degree. As for his legal career, a spokesperson for the Law Society of Manitoba confirmed Mr. McCoshen was called to the bar in 1996, but said he never applied to commence active practice. That means he was not eligible to practise law in the province.
Unmentioned in his biographies is that he went into the fashion business and started a company called Brawd Inc. in Winnipeg about a week after he was called to the bar in 1996. An article in The Globe from the time said Brawd made "well-respected rave gear." He also launched a line of slim-fit jeans.
Kirsten Andrews was hired to help create a lookbook for Brawd and arranged for musicians Tegan and Sara to model the clothing, but the company never paid her invoice. "It really hurt at the time," Ms. Andrews said. Indeed, Brawd ran into money trouble. A source familiar with the company called Mr. McCoshen dedicated, but said Brawd struggled to find retail customers. It filed for bankruptcy in 2003, owing nearly $2.8-million to creditors.
Mr. McCoshen went into a completely different line of work afterward, serving as president of a Winnipeg-based company called Trans Global International Commodities Solutions Inc., founded in 2005, according to corporate records. He and a partner ran it from Winnipeg's tallest office tower. An archived website for the company describes it as a grain exporter with "major trading partners" in Dubai. It's unclear how successful the company was. In 2010, HSBC Bank Canada sued for $18,000 after the company allegedly failed to repay credit facilities, and its landlord later sued for unpaid rent. Trans Global did not respond to either suit in court, and it was dissolved by 2013.
Divorce records for Mr. McCoshen in Manitoba reference a company he ran with the same business partner that had at least $1.9-million in assets. Mr. McCoshen said in an affidavit the company engaged in currency trading, and his partner was "extremely bad" at it. "He lost all of the money," Mr. McCoshen said, "and as such I have left the business."
That was not the only misfortune to allegedly befall Mr. McCoshen. Rather than leading the cushy life of a retired investment banker, he told a Manitoba court in 2014 his personal finances were a mess. "I have a significantly negative net worth close to $500,000," he said in an affidavit related to divorce proceedings. He was having trouble paying his legal fees and received financial support from his parents and friends. The funds were also necessary to "get my business back up and running," he said.
By then, Mr. McCoshen operated a firm called the Usand Group that arranged custom financing deals for Indigenous communities. He was essentially a broker, tapping institutions for loans on behalf of clients and taking a commission. His first year, 2012, was an "unprecedentedly successful year," and he earned $1.1-million before tax, he said in court filings. The windfall led Mr. McCoshen and his then spouse to buy two luxury vehicles and two houses that he said later they couldn't afford and could only be sold at a loss. The following year, Usand was staring down $380,000 in red ink.
"Our finances are on a knife's edge," he wrote to his ex-wife in 2014, according to court filings.
In the same paragraph, he wrote: "One thing you should know is that I am indeed a financial genius."
Somehow, he found a way to keep Usand going. He was inspired to start the company, he's said, after Ovide Mercredi, former National Chief of the Assembly of First Nations, told him about the trouble many communities had getting loans from banks. Initially, he relied on Mr. Mercredi to connect him with First Nations, but the company was soon self-sufficient, he told the Standing Senate Committee on Aboriginal Peoples in 2015, during a hearing about infrastructure on reserves. "My phone doesn't stop ringing these days," he said. "I'm feeling the vibrations right now." (Mr. Mercredi told The Globe he's had no contact with Mr. McCoshen in four years and declined to comment further.)
While working with First Nations, he allegedly employed the same tactic the OSC would later question with respect to Bridging: kickbacks. In 2016, the Aboriginal Peoples Television Network (APTN) published a story in which two First Nations chiefs said they were offered money by Usand as an incentive to sign loan agreements it had arranged. APTN posted an internal Usand document that listed the use of "kickbacks" when doing business and advised "no written record of dealings" be kept.
Both chiefs quoted by APTN stand by the claims they made about Usand. "They offered me $125,000 cash if I went with the Bank of Montreal and was successful in getting that loan," Barry Kennedy, former chief of Carry the Kettle First Nation in Saskatchewan, told The Globe recently.
He said he rejected the offer. The other former chief, Morris Shannacappo of Rolling River First Nation in Manitoba, also stands by his claim that Usand offered him money to accept a loan, which he turned down.
After APTN's reporting, Mr. McCoshen filed a $35-million defamation suit against the reporter and both chiefs, alleging they worked together to harm his reputation by publishing false claims.
(APTN declined to comment, saying the case is before the courts.) Usand denied paying "sponsorships" to individuals. Instead, the company would give back to a community by sharing a portion of its fees "to sponsor appropriate, broad-based community initiatives that were supported by Band council."
The suit also attacked the credibility of the chiefs, claiming they had a history of making unsubstantiated allegations for personal gain. (Mr.
Kennedy said he finds the accusation insulting.)
The chiefs' allegations seemingly did little to slow Mr. McCoshen down. Nor did it deter David Sharpe and Bridging Finance from working with him. It's not entirely clear when and how the two met, but Mr. Sharpe told the OSC they first encountered each other a few years ago through their involvement with First Nations. Mr. McCoshen, in turn, called him a friend in a 2015 affidavit in divorce proceedings.
One of their early deals involved a $10.8-million loan from a Bridging fund to Misipawistik Cree Nation in Manitoba. Usand took nearly $570,000 in commissions for arranging the 2016 transaction.
Misipawistik needed the money to build houses, which Mr. McCoshen would provide through a joint venture with renowned Indigenous architect Douglas Cardinal, who designed the Canadian Museum of History in Ottawa. They used a design of Mr. Cardinal's that employed sustainable materials to reduce mould growth, a problem on many reserves. (Mr. Cardinal did not respond to requests for comment.)
The project to build 30 homes went awry, according to a lawsuit Misipawistik filed last year against Mr. McCoshen and his companies. The joint housing venture, dubbed Douglas Cardinal Housing Corp., began constructing five homes, but none were completed. Usand, which dealt directly with builders on behalf of Misipawistik, hired a new contractor. The lawsuit alleges Usand delayed paying the company, leading it to stop working and then quit entirely. Usand hired a third company, First Nation Builders and Supplier (FNBS), which completed 20 houses. Even so, Misipawistik alleged Usand again delayed payment, resulting in more work stoppages.
Trevor Charrier, owner of FNBS, said he visited Usand's office in Winnipeg multiple times trying to get paid. "There's like 20 desks all set up, and nobody would be in there," he told The Globe.
Eventually, he had to text Mr. Sharpe. "If I don't receive final payment I will be in no position to keep going," he wrote. "I am a small company and can not take a hit of 180K."
Because of the delays in Misipawistik, Mr. McCoshen renegotiated the community's funding arrangement multiple times - the amount grew to $15.9-million - and took a commission for each new deal, according to court documents.
The lawsuit alleged Mr. McCoshen negligently or intentionally created delays to increase the loan and his own commissions. Ten houses were not built because the community had no money left.
Misipawistik said it was saddled with an additional $2.4-million in expenses and needed another $3.1-million to build the remaining houses. The band switched lenders in 2019 and cut ties with Usand. Misipawistik dropped the lawsuit a few months after filing it and declined to comment.
Despite the tumult described in the lawsuit, the First Nation is still listed on the website for Mr. McCoshen's company, which notes it "worked together" with community members and sourced millions of dollars "to build almost 50 homes."
A few years ago, an apparent whistle-blower went to Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC) with grave concerns about Peguis First Nation, the largest such community in Manitoba. The concerns included a number of allegations about business deals the First Nation had made, including that Mr. McCoshen's company paid kickbacks to certain band members and representatives.
The department commissioned Deloitte to investigate, which sent its findings in a confidential report to INAC in 2018. Deloitte did not identify "information to support or refute the payment of kickbacks by Usand" to anyone in Peguis, according to a copy reviewed by The Globe, but the investigation was limited because Deloitte couldn't access crucial documents, and key individuals declined to be interviewed, including Mr. McCoshen. The report, however, details questionable transactions he was involved in.
He first came to the reserve in 2012 and struck a deal with Peguis to move its accounts from Royal Bank of Canada to the Bank of Montreal, while taking on additional financing. Deloitte could not determine why Peguis did so.
The next year, he formed a new company that was jointly owned by Usand and a local Peguis business development firm. Peguis instructed Mr. McCoshen's new entity to help find $22-million for a land deal the community was pursuing. In the end, Peguis secured the funds from its own trust (which contained money from a landclaim settlement with the federal government) and not an outside bank. Mr. McCoshen's company invoiced Peguis for helping broker the deal and was paid $935,000, but Deloitte found no evidence it played a role. "The question arises as to why any financing fees would be paid" to the company, according to the report.
His fees for other services drew concern, too.
Around the same time, Peguis retained Usand for three months and directed it to secure financing. Usand obtained $29-million from BMO, but its engagement with Peguis stretched to 15 months. Each month, it received a $15,000 work fee.
Some Peguis representatives pushed Mr. McCoshen to justify why Usand should continue to be paid. When one official questioned him over e-mail, Mr. McCoshen forwarded the message to another band member, writing, "[Expletive] hate this idiot." He threatened to sue the community and withheld the funding until he was paid his fee of close to $1.2-million.
Later that year, Peguis appeared to pay Usand in full, though Deloitte noted it could not obtain supporting information documenting the payments. The company's monthly fee was supposed to be deducted from the final amount, but it does not appear that happened. Usand was possibly overpaid by $225,000, according to Deloitte.
He only deepened his relationship with Peguis in the following years - and brought in Bridging Finance, too. When Peguis faced a housing shortage and a lack of job opportunities in 2017, it turned to Mr. McCoshen to find money for economic development, and he arranged a $30-million loan from Bridging. But Peguis already had a loan from BMO, and it was not supposed to take on more debt without advising the bank. The Bridging loan put Peguis in breach of its covenant, and BMO demanded repayment.
Peguis was forced to find $30.4-million in 30 days, according to a report from Chief Peguis Investment Corp. (CPIC), which manages investments on behalf of the community. Mr. McCoshen was again there to assist. He brokered another Bridging loan with a high interest rate - more than 11 per cent, compared with about 4.7 per cent from BMO. CPIC says Usand was paid more than $7.2-million in fees for brokering deals for Peguis.
The community is now heavily indebted, with more than $122-million owed to Bridging as of March, 2020, according to Peguis's financial statements. The relationship has soured, too. In May, council sent a letter to band members claiming Bridging refused to advance funds for a new seniors' centre and a gas station. "Chief and Council realized that [Bridging] had no interest in the advancement of the community or the direct needs of our people," the letter reads.
Council retained band member and former senator Murray Sinclair to review the transactions with Bridging earlier this year, before it was placed into receivership. "The amount of interest that [Bridging] was charging Peguis was phenomenal," he told The Globe in an interview.
"The concern I had was that it is conceivable that Peguis was taken advantage of."
Alan Park, the CEO of CPIC, has a different view of where blame lies for Peguis's financial woes. Bridging, he said, came to the rescue when BMO called its loan. A good portion of the fault should fall on Mr. McCoshen, who earned fees every time he brokered Peguis's debt, starting with the original BMO loan, then the Bridging loan that put Peguis in breach, and finally another Bridging loan to pay out BMO, he said.
The vast majority of Indigenous community borrowers are honourable and reliable clients, he added. But when loans go bad, he said, the cause can usually be traced to one thing: band councils who are "led astray by advisers who have no skin in the game, other than a quick cash grab, tell the community what they want to hear and leave town in a Lamborghini to the airport to get on their private jet."
As Mr. McCoshen has spent more time on the A2A railway project in recent years, his personal assets have ballooned. Between 2019 and 2021, he splurged on multimillion-dollar properties in Vancouver, a vacation pad in Turks and Caicos, and a 7,700-square-foot mansion in Lake Oswego, Ore. In Los Angeles, he sublet a home described in real estate listings as an "entertainer's paradise" for $32,500 a month, according to legal documents.
To outfit his abodes, he hired a Vancouverbased interior designer whose Instagram page is a testament to his expensive tastes: a marble steam shower, an infinity pool overlooking an Oregon mountain range and a Seiler grand piano atop a zebra-print rug. ("If the client doesn't play but they have the space, I still put in the grand piano," the caption reads.)
For Mr. McCoshen, it seems like a remarkable reversal of fortunes, considering just a few years earlier, he was struggling to get his finances together. His main project, A2A, does not yet have revenue, either. How he turned his finances around - and where all the money came from - isn't clear.
His real estate spending spree happened after Bridging Finance started advancing millions of dollars to A2A, and some of the loan transfers from Bridging to A2A appear "to be outside of the normal course of business," PwC, Bridging's receiver, alleged in a recent report. In total, PwC found a dozen transfers of Bridging funds as part of the A2A loan since 2015. About $83-million went to a numbered company Mr. McCoshen controlled, and PwC could not determine the commercial relationship between it and A2A.
Another $25.5-million went to one of Mr. McCoshen's personal bank accounts last year.
The numbered company is the same one the OSC alleges he used to transfer $19.5-million to Mr. Sharpe between 2016 and 2019. Some of the payments arrived in Mr. Sharpe's bank account within days of Bridging advancing loan funds, according to the OSC. While Mr. Sharpe denied the payments were kickbacks and said they were loans for him to make personal investments, he acknowledged the optics. "It certainly does not look good," he told the OSC. "That's for sure."
A2A is also an unusual investment for Bridging, which has long marketed its specialty in short-term lending. In addition, Bridging tends to charge high interest rates to compensate for the risky nature of its borrowers, but A2A does not pay interest in cash; its interest charges are instead added to the total value of the loan, to be repaid only at maturity. The company now owes about $208-million to Bridging, which also has an equity stake in A2A that it values at $109-million.
Despite the large sums transferred to A2A, a source familiar with its operations said its largest expenses were engineering consulting fees and legal bills, and these costs did not come close to $200-million. PwC demanded repayment of the funds from the company and from Mr. McCoshen, who guaranteed the loan. A2A told the receiver it only has $1-million in cash on hand after making other priority payments.
The OSC has inquired about Mr. McCoshen's ability to backstop such a sizeable debt. Mr. Sharpe told the regulator the permits already obtained by A2A, including one issued by Mr. Trump, held a lot of value. Bridging also submitted a net-worth statement to the OSC valuing Mr. McCoshen at $3.9-billion - but nearly the entire amount is attributed to A2A, based on an estimate prepared by consulting firm McKinsey and Co. Built into that number is the large assumption, in the OSC's view, that governments will contribute billions to the project. After removing the railway company, the OSC said Mr. McCoshen's net worth is negative $96-million.
Since Bridging was placed in receivership, A2A has been hit with departures. Last year, J.P.
Gladu, former head of the Canadian Council for Aboriginal Business, signed on as president and worked to engage Indigenous communities. He appeared with Mr. McCoshen in front of the House of Commons transportation committee back in April. "It has been an absolute pleasure to be working on this project with Sean," Mr. Gladu said. "His passion for this work is palpable."
On June 2, he sent in his resignation letter.
"The events over the past month concerning Bridging Finance Inc. have significantly compromised the vision of A2A Rail and put the project's future in immediate peril," he wrote in the letter, obtained by The Globe. "The uncertainty emerging out of recent events have undermined the carefully constructed relationships I have worked hard to build with the Indigenous peoples and governments of the Canadian Northwest."
Mr. McCoshen can no longer count on Mr. Sharpe either, as he was removed from his CEO post at Bridging immediately after PwC took control. In the previous few months, Mr. McCoshen was evidently on his mind. More than once last year, Mr. Sharpe and another Bridging executive asked an employee to go to the office and perform searches for e-mails to delete, according to PwC. In total, 34,000 e-mails were wiped from Bridging's server.
Among the search terms was "Sean McCoshen."

Full text: FICTION JUNE THE OTHER BLACK GIRL, Zakiya Dalila Harris (Atria, June) If you like your summer buzzy and cicadas aren't your thing, then consider this monster debut by an exKnopf Doubleday employee - a sharp social satire about a Black editorial assistant who finds her otherwise cozy position at a lily-white Manhattan publishing house upended by the arrival of another Black girl with unnervingly unassailable bona fides.
THE GREAT MISTAKE, Jonathan Lee (Knopf, June) Despite having played a key role in the restructuring of New York into five boroughs (the response to which lent this novel its title) and the creation of Central Park, Andrew Haswell Green is a largely forgotten figure today. Lee aims to rectify this through a novel that is part GildedAge whodunnit - Green was murdered in front of his Park Avenue home in 1903, at 83 years old - part fictional biography, all rendered in the author's quietly elegant prose.
LUCIA, Alex Pheby (Biblioasis, June) An air of mystery has always clung to Lucia Joyce - daughter of writer James, dancer and lover of, among others, Samuel Beckett and Alexander Calder - partly because much of her life was spent in mental institutions, though it didn't help that the Joyce estate decided to burn major chunks of her correspondence. In an original, bravura turn, British novelist Alex Pheby tells Lucia's story from the perspective of the various men around her (spoiler alert: None comes off well).
AND MILES TO GO BEFORE I SLEEP, Jocelyne Saucier (Coach House, June) Saucier's well-received previous novel, And the Birds Rained Down, was the first Canadian title to win France's international Prix des Cinq Continents de la Francophonie. It was also turned into a 2019 feature film. This novel, like its predecessor (also translated by Rhonda Mullins), is concerned with the lives of elderly Northern Ontarians, in this case one Gladys Comeau, who vanishes shortly after she boards a train in the (real) town of Swastika.
JULY WHAT STRANGE PARADISE, Omar El Akkad (McClelland & Stewart, July) This follow-up to the CanadianEgyptian journalist's well-received 2017 debut, American War, weaves back and forth through time in telling the story of nine-year-old Amir Utu, a Syrian refugee who unwittingly undertakes a perilous, multiday voyage by fishing boat to Alexandria.
A PASSAGE NORTH, Anuk Arudpragasam (Hogarth, July) This ruminative, elegant sophomore effort by the Sri Lankan-American writer uses a simple premise - a young man travelling by train from Colombo to attend the village funeral of his grandmother's caregiver - as the scaffold for a portrait of a country still reeling in the aftermath of its decades-long civil war.
HER TURN, Katherine Ashenburg (Knopf, July) Set in Washington during Hillary Clinton's run for the 2015 U.S. presidential primary, Ashenburg's second novel (her first was published when she was 72) is a Nora Ephronesque comedy of social manners revolving around Liz, a middle-aged newspaper columnist whose life starts to unravel after she receives a whinging personal essay by her exhusband's lover, now his wife.
WE WANT WHAT WE WANT, Alix Ohlin (Anansi/Astoria, July) Families, and more particularly, their dysfunction, are a frequent focus in the 13 stories comprising the two-time Giller finalist's new collection. In one, a young woman returns home from a gap year volunteering in Ghana and learns that her childhood BFF is engaged to her father.
Yikes.
TUSCAN DAUGHTER, Lisa Rochon (HarperAvenue, July) The sights and sounds of Renaissance Florence are vividly rendered in this debut novel by architecture critic and ex-Globe columnist Lisa Rochon, about a peasant girl who roams the city's labyrinthine and at times dangerous streets in search of her missing mother.
AUGUST ALL'S WELL, Mona Awad (Hamish Hamilton, August) After the stage accident that ended her acting career and left her addicted to painkillers, theatre professor Miranda Fitch is a woman on the edge. Until, that is, she acquires, through miraculous intervention, the ability to transfer her pain to others, which she gleefully does, especially on those who doubted her pain in the first place.
THE WOMEN OF TROY, Pat Barker (Doubleday, August) In the second instalment of the Booker Prize-winning author's bold feminist retelling of Homer's Iliad, Troy has fallen, but the celebrations are on hold: The victorious Greeks have managed to offend the gods, who are now, as is their wont, preventing their return home. The captive Trojan queen Briseis, meanwhile, plots her path to revenge.
LAST SUMMER IN THE CITY, Gianfranco Calligarich (Farrar, Straus and Giroux, August) This brief, semi-autobiographical tale about young man rambling aimlessly around Rome in the late 1960s suffered multiple publisher rejections in the author's home country until it was finally seized upon and championed by the writer Natalia Ginzburg. First published in 1973, this "forgotten classic of Italian literature" has now been translated into English for the first time.
THE WINTER WIVES, Linden MacIntyre (Random House, August) An unholy trinity of golf, death and dementia lies at the centre of the Giller Prize-winner's latest, a psychological drama about two old friends who married sisters, but are in love with the same one.
THE SNOW LINE, Tessa McWatt (Random House, August) McWatt's novel, self-dubbed "a King Lear story for brown girls," begins in small train station in Punjab in 2009, where four strangers disembark from a train en route to a traditional Indian wedding. Despite their different ages and backgrounds, the four forge a friendship and together end up travelling to the Himalayas to help one of their group, a recent widower, scatter his wife's ashes.
THE LISTENERS, Jordan Tannahill (HarperAvenue, August) Conspiracies and paranoia abound in the playwright's second novel, also the basis of a forthcoming opera co-commissioned by the Norwegian National Opera. A woman, plagued by a hum that her own family can't hear, ends up connecting with a group of people who share her torment, and in so doing unleashes a sinister series of events.
UNDERSONG, Kathleen Winter (Knopf, August) Using rich prose and alternating narratives - one by a family servant speaking to a colony of bees, the other by a local sycamore tree - Winter's new novel takes an unconventional approach in its portrayal of the unconventional Dorothy Wordsworth, a talented nature writer here posited as the stalwart genius behind her brother William's poetry.
NON-FICTION MAY MADHOUSE AT THE END OF THE EARTH, Julian Sancton (Crown, May) A riveting true tale of late-19th-century exploration gone awry with all the elements of a gothic horror: a Belgian ship stuck in the ice for months during Antarctica's endless night, too much booze and too little food (unless you count raw penguin), a mutinous crew slowly losing its marbles, a captain prone to fits of weeping and a desperate, lastditch plan for escape. The ship's first mate was a boyish Roald Amundsen who, sucker for punishment that he was, later went back for more.
JUNE COMING TO OUR SENSES, Susan R. Barry (Basic, June) While researching the fascinating and inspiring story of a boy and a girl - born blind and deaf, respectively - who learned to see and hear after receiving surgical intervention, Barry, a neurobiologist who herself gained sight in both eyes in midlife, arrived at a new theory about the nature of perception.
CARE OF: LETTERS, CONNECTIONS, AND CURES, Ivan Coyote (M&S, June) Like most artists, Coyote was initially hit hard by last year's lockdown - but the peripatetic spoken-word performer managed to turn lemons into lemonade by delving into their stockpile of unanswered letters, many from fans who, like Coyote, were trans/non-binary. The resulting correspondence is as crystalline and heartbreaking as anything Coyote has done in a career already full of highlights.
OCTOBER CHILD, Linda Bostrom Knausgard, (World Editions, June) While her ex-husband detailed the minutiae of his bowel movements and premature ejaculations to a rapt global readership over thousands of pages in his My Struggle books, Linda Bostrom was often just a background figure, or source of annoyance, even as her life-altering depression deepened. Artfully combining fiction and autobiography, the Swedish novelist here gives voice to her own, decidedly grim struggles, which included four years getting electroconvulsive therapy in psychiatric institutions.
DIARY OF A YOUNG NATURALIST, Dara McAnulty (Greystone, June) This memoir, winner of a major U.K.
nature-writing prize, is remarkable for almost too many reasons to name - the fact that its Irish author wrote it when he was only 15 and that that he, along with four other members of his immediate family, is autistic, being in some ways least among them. The best reason to read this book - suitable for young and old alike - is the original, heartfelt voice of its author, who, along with Greta Thunberg, is on his way to becoming one of the most visible environmental campaigners of his generation.
REMEMBERINGS: SCENES FROM MY COMPLICATED LIFE, Sinead O'Connor (Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, June) When the doe-eyed, shaven-headed singer blazed to prominence in the late 1980s, her alternately fierce and vulnerable persona was as much a part of her appeal as her music. The title of this warts-and-all autobiography is relative: O'Connor's confesses she can't remember most of the previous two decades, but what she does recall is surprising, wrenching and even funny.
PURE FLAME: A MEMOIR, Michelle Orange (HarperCollins, June) In the mid-1980s, Michelle Orange's mother became part of a famous study on female careerism when she left her husband and three children in London, Ont., to pursue her corporate ambitions in another city. Orange embarked on this fiercely intelligent memoir - which doubles as a critique of feminism and maternal failure - to try to come to terms with her mother's decision and their decades-long estrangement.
GENIUSES AT WAR: BLETCHLEY PARK, COLOSSUS, AND THE DAWN OF THE DIGITAL AGE, David A Price (Knopf, June) Accounts of Second World War codebreaking have invariably focused, and with reason, on Alan Turing's cracking of the Enigma cipher.
Drawing on recently declassified sources, this highly readable account explains how two Turing protégés managed to foil Tunny, a lesser-known but far more complex encryption machine, using the world's first digital electronic computer, on which its creators bestowed the Marvel-worthy name Colossus.
THE PLAGUE YEAR: AMERICA IN THE TIME OF COVID, Lawrence Wright (Knopf, June) Many people are ready, understandably, to put the past year-plus' events - or lack thereof - behind them. Those craving a bit of perspective, on the other hand, would be hard pressed to find better a guide than the Pulitzer Prize-winner in this expanded version of his New Yorker essay of the same title. (Lawrence's prescient last novel, The End of October, published in April, 2020, was set amidst a global pandemic.)
JULY AN UGLY TRUTH: INSIDE FACEBOOK'S BATTLE FOR DOMINATION, Sheera Frenkel and Cecilia Kang (HarperCollins, July) Was Facebook's descent into a cesspool of conspiracy theories and dangerous echo chambers over the past five years a feature or a bug? The authors of this book, two award-winning New York Times reporters, suggest some surprising answers in a no-holds-barred exposé that aims to reveal "fatal cracks in the architecture of the tech behemoth."
THIS IS YOUR MIND ON PLANTS , Michael Pollan (Penguin Press, July) Pollan offered himself up as a willing guinea pig in this continentspanning deep dive into three plantbased drugs: opium, mescaline and caffeine, that doubles, in part, as an exposé of America's hypocritical War on Drugs.
AUGUST WHERE BEAUTY SURVIVED: AN AFRICADIAN MEMOIR, George Elliott Clarke (Knopf, August) One of Canada's most decorated poets offers a candid view of his African-Nova Scotian (Africadian) upbringing and the forces that shaped him, including a fraught relationship with his father, an autodidact whose own creativity was thwarted by an unfulfilling job on the railway.
THE ARBORNAUT: A LIFE DISCOVERING THE EIGHTH CONTINENT IN THE TREES ABOVE US, Meg Lowman (FSG, August) The pioneering Australian biologist and climate activist - dubbed "the real-life Lorax" - has penned an immersive, high-energy account of her decades spent exploring, often solo, the world's tree canopies from hundreds of feet high in the air WHITE MALICE: THE CIA AND THE COVERT RECOLONIZATION OF AFRICA, Susan Williams (Public Affairs, August) Another season, another book about nefarious CIA machinations.
This latest probes how the U.S. used its foreign intelligence service to systematically, and sometimes violently, undermine postcolonial African independence movements in Ghana and the Congo to satisfy its own imperial ambitions.
POETRY LETTERS IN A BRUISED COSMOS, Liz Howard (M&S, June) Howard's debut collection, Infinite Citizen of the Shaking Tent, won the 2016 Griffin Poetry Prize and was shortlisted for the 2015 Governor-General's Award for poetry. Her latest, which invokes the knowledge histories of Western and Indigenous astrophysical science, describes itself as "part autobiography, part philosophical puzzlement, part love song." THE 2021 GRIFFIN POETRY PRIZE ANTHOLOGY, Ed. Souvankham Thammavongsa (Anansi, July) The Griffin's annual anthology, edited this year by poet and Giller Prize-winner Souvankham Thammavongsa, is the perfect, least intimidating way to get acquainted with the Canadian and international poets shortlisted for the one of the world's richest, most prestigious poetry prizes.
GOLDENROD, Maggie Smith (Simon & Schuster, July) In more innocent times, when 2016 was still considered the worst year ever, the American poet's Good Bones was declared by some on social media the Official Poem of 2016 for its mood of barely contained desperation - summed up in the opening line: "Life is short, though I keep this from my children." Smith's new collection uses everyday objects to explore themes of parenthood, solitude, love and memory.
PURGATORIO, Dante Alighieri, Trans. Mary Jo Bang (Graywolf, July) Alternately called brilliant and sacrilegious, you could say Bang's translation of Dante's Inferno, which eschewed the Italian poet's traditional rhyming scheme and incorporated pop-culture elements, wound up in a kind of critical purgatory, even as the controversy served to breathe new life into old work. The publication of Bang's second instalment in her translation of The Divine Comedy has been timed to coincide with the 700th anniversary of the poet's death.
MAKE THE WORLD NEW: THE POETRY OF LILLIAN ALLEN, Ed. Ronald Cummings (Wilfrid Laurier University Press, August) In the 1980s, the Jamaican-born activist and professor became a major voice of Black feminism in Canada and a key figure in the dub-poetry movement that swept cities around the globe. This, Allen's first book of her poems to be published in more than 20 years, combines greatest hits from previous collections with new, never-before-published verse.
GRAPHICA FICTIONAL FATHER, Joe Ollmann (Drawn & Quarterly, May) Intergenerational angst and imposter syndrome feature in this tragicomic "memoir" by Caleb, a middle-aged recovering alcoholic and painter who inherits his late cartoonist father's syrupy but hugely popular newspaper strip based on a father-son relationship nothing like their own.
Features cameos by Canadian comic luminaries Seth and Chester Brown.
EURIPIDES THE TROJAN WOMEN: A COMIC, Anne Carson, Ill. Rosanna Bruno (New Directions, June) Canadian poet and classicist Greek Anne Carson teamed up with artist Rosanna Bruno for this irreverent rendering of Euripides's tragedy following the fates of the titular women - here represented as animals - in the wake of the sack of Troy. Don't let the children's-picture-book formatting fool you though: Hekabe, "an ancient emaciated sled dog of filth," for example, is referred to as "top bitch." FACTORY SUMMERS, Guy Delisle, (D&Q, June) In this blackand-white coming-of-age graphic memoir, Delisle - labelled "one of the greatest modern cartoonists" by the Guardian - recalls with poignancy and humour the class tensions that permeated the summers he spent working, starting at the age of 16, on the floor of the Quebec City pulp mill where his father was manager for 30 years RESISTANCE, Val McDermid, Ill. Kathryn Briggs (Atlantic, June) At an outdoor music festival, a rapidly spreading case of food poisoning is soon revealed to be something much more sinister - with obvious parallels to COVID - in this debut graphic outing by the bestselling Scottish crime writer.
SEEK YOU: A JOURNEY THROUGH AMERICAN LONELINESS, Kristen Radtke (Knopf, July) The Brooklynbased writer and illustrator started working on this beautiful, introspective book about loneliness long before the pandemic made it our global, de facto reality. In moody, monochromatic panels, Radtke reflects on a series of loneliness-adjacent subjects, from sitcom laugh tracks to the bespoke isolation of the urban dweller.

Full text: It was May of 1979 and Montreal's business establishment was still reeling from the election of the Parti Québécois 21/2 years earlier. The referendum on Quebec independence was looming and well-known companies such as Sun Life Assurance Co.
were picking up stakes and moving down Highway 401 to Toronto.
Angus MacNaughton, vicechairman of Genstar Ltd., a growing conglomerate and stock-market darling, also decided to leave town. The company's annual meeting was told that Montreal was no longer a good place for a headquarters because high income taxes, political uncertainty and language laws made it hard to attract managerial talent.
But instead of opting for Toronto, Genstar surprised everyone by announcing that the company had opted to move its executive offices to San Francisco. Mr. MacNaughton explained the company's growing collection of subsidiaries - in cement, building materials, chemicals, real estate development and maritime transportation - was focused on Western Canada and the U.S. Sunbelt, and Genstar wanted to be nearer the action.
For Mr. MacNaughton, who died on May 19 in Danville, Calif., of melanoma at the age of 89, it was the kind of daring move that characterized a career of buying and selling companies as he climbed to the top of the Canadian business establishment. Yet soon after accomplishing his greatest coup, the 1985 purchase of Canada Trust, Genstar was broken up and he faded from the limelight as a wealthy private investor in California.
"He loved deal-making," his son, Andrew, said. "It was his raison d'être. He was quick with numbers. He could negotiate very quickly because he could do all the math in his head."
In 1985, he was called one of Canada's 10 best CEOs ever, alongside the likes of Seagram Co.'s Samuel Bronfman. Writing in The Globe and Mail, financial analyst Jim Doak called him "the model financial engineer" who skilfully built Genstar and sold it at the perfect moment.
"He pushed his executives to meet their budgeted returns, so much so that they suggested he had no personality, just internal rates of return," Mr. Doak wrote.
Angus MacNaughton was born in Montreal on July 15, 1931, the eldest son of Athole Austin MacNaughton, a Montreal restaurant owner who later ran a hotel in the Laurentians, and his wife, Emily Kidder MacNaughton (née McLean). Angus attended Roslyn Elementary School in Westmount, Lakefield College School in Lakefield, Ont., and Lower Canada College in Montreal before taking courses at McGill University and qualifying as a chartered accountant.
He began working at McDonald Currie & Co., a Montreal accounting firm, and in 1955 was hired by Sogémines Ltd., a firm controlled by Société Générale de Belgique to invest in Canadian resources as it exited the Congo, buying up assets such as Montreal's Miron Cement limestone quarry. Mr. MacNaughton moved up the ranks and oversaw the company's expansion after it morphed into Genstar.
Richard Paterson followed a similar route, studying accounting at Montreal's Concordia University before joining Sogémines in 1967, working with Mr. MacNaughton for the rest of his career, ending up as senior vicepresident and chief financial officer.
As a boss, Mr. MacNaughton kept employees on their toes.
"You had to know what you were doing because he could go through numbers so quickly," Mr. Paterson recalled. And unlike other financiers who find it easy to buy assets but hard to sell, Mr. MacNaughton had no such problems. "There was no emotion involved. A decision was made on the basis of facts and you moved on," Mr. Paterson said.
Genstar's leadership was unusual. Mr. MacNaughton teamed up with Winnipeg native Ross Turner and the duo became inseparable, with Mr. MacNaughton responsible for the financial side of things and Mr. Turner for operations. Starting in 1976, the two men alternated as Genstar's president and CEO on an annual basis.
They came to be called the Bobbsey Twins.
And although its largest shareholder was Belgian, Genstar managed to convince officials in Ottawa that the company could be considered Canadian-controlled and thereby exempt from onerous foreign investment review oversight then in force. It was a significant coup.
As well as expanding its cement and building materials operations, Genstar became a major real estate developer, buying up tracts of land in Alberta, British Columbia and the U.S. Sunbelt. A notable deal involved the purchase of a 5,000-acre tract of valuable land near San Diego from the Teamsters union's pension fund, which found itself forced to sell after pressure from U.S. regulators. It proved very profitable.
Even after moving its executive offices to San Francisco, Genstar kept a high profile in Canada as its executives flew back and forth in the corporate Gulfstream. In 1984, The Globe surveyed salaries of top executives at Canadian companies publicly listed in the United States (Canadian regulators didn't demand that kind of disclosure), and disclosed that Mr. MacNaughton and Mr. Turner were the second-highest earners, each drawing an annual salary of US$856,126. That's more than the CEOs of Bell Canada, Imperial Oil, Alcan or Canadian Pacific took home.
In 1981, Genstar bought Canada Permanent Mortgage Corp., and four years later, scooped up Canada Trustco Mortgage Co. (operating as Canada Trust), at the time the largest independently owned trust company in the country.
The takeover was not without drama after Canada Trust CEO Mervyn Lahn made it clear he wasn't thrilled about losing the company's independence. Genstar kept him in his job, but there was tension with the more flamboyant Mr. MacNaughton and Mr. Turner. "It has not been a convivial relationship," Mr. Lahn told Maclean's.
But within a year of the Canada Trust takeover, it was Genstar itself that was fighting for its independence after Imasco Ltd., the Montreal-based tobacco giant, swooped in with a bid to take over Genstar itself. The takeover succeeded and Genstar was broken up, with Imasco keeping Canada Trust and selling off the remaining assets. (Toronto-Dominion Bank bought Canada Trust in 2000.)
An effort by Mr. MacNaughton and Mr. Turner to keep Genstar's non-financial assets was rebuffed, but they did get to retain the Genstar name, using it to set up a private equity firm called Genstar Capital with Mr. Paterson and John West, another senior Genstar official. Mr. MacNaughton remained involved through several funds, but by the mid-1990s he was largely retired.
Although crafting deals and making money were his passions, Mr. MacNaughton loved the good things of life, from collecting watches to building and owning boats, including a cigarette racing boat and a 42-foot cruiser.
Cars were always a special hobby, starting when he was a young accountant in Montreal. On his way to work, he would pass by Cumming Perrault, a local car dealership, and covetously eye a powder blue 1956 Lincoln Continental convertible with its signature "suicide doors," his son recalls.
The $2,000 price tag was a bit too rich so the young Mr. MacNaughton passed up on the purchase. One day, the Lincoln was gone. He was devastated. But two days later, it reappeared in the showroom. He asked the salesman what had happened. Turns out the car had been bought with a $500 down payment, used for a bank robbery, then abandoned.
The dealer had taken the car back and Mr. MacNaughton arranged to buy it for the balance of $1,500. Thus started a love affair with a series of Lincolns, with the last one biting the dust in 1996, Andrew said. Over the years, he also owned a 1933 Packard, a Rolls Royce, several Mercedes and a few of his favourite brand, the Bentley.
Mr. MacNaughton also flew his own plane. Mr. Paterson recalls how his boss would think nothing of flying down from San Francisco to his home in Lake Tahoe on Friday for a weekend of skiing and returning on Sunday evening. He also kept a home in the Swiss ski resort of Klosters.
But it was heli-skiing he loved above all, usually using Whistler, B.C., as a base for an annual preChristmas vacation with his son.
It's a tradition he kept up until he was 85. In summer, skiing was replaced by golf.
Mr. MacNaughton also enjoyed world travel. In style. His daughter, Gillian, recalls the round-theworld trip in 2001 that included 10 family members. "In a month, we went to Bora Bora, Cairns in Australia, Vietnam, the Maldives, South Africa, Rio de Janeiro and the Galapagos. We spent three days in each place." All travelling by private jet.
Beyond Genstar, Mr. MacNaughton served on the boards of several large corporations, including Sun Life, Barrick Gold, Canadian Pacific, Fairmont Hotels, Stelco Inc., Royal Trustco, Wolverine Tube and Varian Semiconductors.
Among his volunteer ventures, Mr. MacNaughton served as a trustee of the Lakefield College School Foundation, was past chairman of the San Francisco Bay Area Council of the Boy Scouts of America, was a former member of the Hudson Institute and a senior member of the Conference Board of New York.
Mr. MacNaughton leaves his wife, Cathy, whom he married in 1997. Three previous marriages ended in divorce. He also leaves his daughter, Gillian, an associate professor of human rights at the University of Massachusetts; son, Andrew, a onetime triathlete and coach; as well as his brother, Bruce MacNaughton.

Full text: The 4.3-million-square-foot TD Centre in downtown Toronto comprises six towers and a banking pavilion. Most feature matte-black steel I-beams, a calling card of architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe. The first three buildings were among his last projects (he died in 1969, the year after it opened), and they dominated the skyline. Heritage Toronto, a charity, salutes the complex as a "carefully conserved mid-century modern gem."
Yet even as architecture buffs gazed skyward at the imposing grandeur of the 55-storey TD Tower, a small coterie of avian conservationists noted the small, broken bodies of birds piling up at its base. Michael Mesure, executive director of FLAP Canada, a charity that advocates on bird-building collisions, said the complex has windows that reflect the open space and landscape vegetation around it during the day, and the black facade makes it disappear into the night. Both can be deadly for birds.
"Since 2000, we've picked up over 10,000 birds in and around the buildings at the TD Centre" of more than 60 species, he said.
People learn cues that signal the presence of glass. Birds don't. They're particularly vulnerable to reflective glass at lower floors, which can create an illusion of welcoming sky or wooded habitat by reflecting the surrounding environment. They often also mistake transparent windows for unobstructed passages. The result is high-velocity impacts causing severe head trauma. At night, artificial light from buildings attracts migrating birds into the city.
According to the American Bird Conservancy, up to one billion birds die from building strikes annually in the U.S. alone. Toronto is a hotspot because it's situated along one of the continent's busiest migration corridors.
After years of complaints from activists, work began on Tuesday at the TD Centre - one of Canada's largest office complexes - to install countermeasures to reduce the daylight collisions.
A vinyl film featuring small dots spaced five centimetres apart will be applied to the outside of windows in several of the complex's six buildings. The work will continue into the fall and resume next year, said Paul Groleau, vice-president of Feather Friendly Technologies, the company that manufactures the film in Mississauga. All told, more than 100,000 square feet of film are needed to cover the buildings' windows on the first several stories.
"The idea is you're breaking up that surface reflection of the glass," Mr. Groleau said. "So if a bird's booting along at the window, they'll go, ‘Whoa, there's something there!' And they'll avoid it."
Bird populations across North America are declining owing to collisions and other factors such as pesticide use, habitat loss and climate change. A study published in the journal Science in 2019 evaluated population changes for 529 species in North America: It found a net loss of 2.9 billion birds since 1970, a decline of 29 per cent.
Mr. Mesure said the installation at the TD Centre will be the largest bird-safe building retrofit in North America, possibly worldwide. At other sites where the product has been installed, he added, collisions declined by more than 80 per cent.
Mr. Mesure said few Torontonians appreciate the scale of the problem.
"We're all just either just waking up, or we're just making our way to work, when all this is happening," he said. "By the time people come in to work, it's pretty much over. Birds that survived are hidden away. [The ones that died have] been scavenged, in some cases they've been swept up. They're off the sidewalks before anyone sees how bad it really can be."
Mr. Mesure's eyes were opened early one morning in 1990, when he discovered hundreds of dead birds blanketing Toronto's financial district. A few years later, he founded the Fatal Light Awareness Program (FLAP), which in its earliest days focused on night-time collisions.
He's been in frequent contact with TD Centre's owners and managers ever since.
Pearl Shore is a newcomer activist. In 2019, she founded Bird Safe Buildings Across Canada, a community-led initiative. Formerly a long-time customer of TD, she closed her accounts over dissatisfaction with the response to TD Centre's collision problem, and had dozens of friends and relatives write letters to the bank's chief executive officer.
She started social-media campaigns and a petition that got 75,000 signatures.
"We were pretty relentless," she said. "We basically told them, we're not going away until it's done."
There are myriad varieties of glass, and a single pane's appearance varies with the seasons and even the hour, reflecting light at some times while appearing completely transparent at others.
Cadillac Fairview Corp., whose properties include the TD complex, struggled with collisions at another Toronto site, the lowrise Yonge Corporate Centre (YCC), which features highly-reflective glass. Decades ago, it urged tenants to turn their lights off at night to prevent nocturnal collisions. During the late 1990s, it installed custom-built cables strung with silhouettes of predatory birds, an approach that proved ineffective.
In 2007, it applied a film called CollidEscape to windows of a single YCC tenant, but removed it because it obscured the outside view.
These actions proved crucial when EcoJustice, a legal advocacy group specializing in environment-related litigation, commenced a private prosecution charging Cadillac Fairview with offences relating to bird collisions at YCC.
The judge acquitted the company in 2013 after concluding its management "acted with due diligence."
The decision nonetheless had major consequences, because the judge also found that reflected light from YCC's windows constituted harmful emissions under the province's Environmental Protection Act. And the judge found that some birds killed at YCC were listed under the Species At Risk Act. Landlords, building owners and managers who chose to ignore the collision issue had been put on notice that they could face such charges too.
"Once that happened, everything began to change," Mr. Mesure said. He added that in recent years, Ontario's Ministry of Environment has increasingly followed up on complaints from the public about major bird strikes.
Options for preventing collisions have increased considerably of late. The American Bird Conservancy's database of collision deterrents lists 93 products for professional use.
Feather Friendly says it has installed about five million square feet of its film across North America and in South Korea, Poland, Brazil, Germany and Britain.
Countermeasures are no longer optional in a small number of cities.
In 2010, Toronto became the first city globally to make birdcollision countermeasures mandatory in most new buildings.
New York recently introduced a local law requiring most glass on new buildings to meet birdfriendly design standards.
Ms. Shore said she hoped other major players in commercial real estate, such as Oxford Properties Group, BentallGreenOak and Brookfield, will follow Cadillac Fairview's example.
"This is pretty easy to solve, relative to other problems that we have in society," she said.

Full text: A Toronto condo developer is buying hundreds of detached houses in Ontario, with the plan of renting them and profiting on the housing crisis ripping across the country.
Core Development Group Ltd.
is building a large-scale singlefamily home rental operation, an unproven business model in Canada, where the market is fragmented and individual investors lease a small number of their own properties for income.
Institutional house rentals have become highly lucrative in the United States, with privateequity firms, pension funds and big companies throwing billions of dollars into the asset class.
In Canada, deep-pocketed investors, as well as real estate investment trusts, have already acquired hundreds of apartment buildings to tap into the strong rental demand but have not moved into rental houses.
Core founder Corey Hawtin and executive vice-president Faran Latafat questioned why there wasn't a similar business in Canada, which has had a rental vacancy rate below 3 per cent since the turn of the century.
"We were trying to answer the question: Why is nobody doing this in Canada? We could not come up with an objective answer to that. In Canada, it works as well or better than the U.S.," said Ms. Latafat, who is leading Core's single-family home rental division.
Core's main business is condo development, and it has 14 projects in the Toronto region.
Last fall, Mr. Hawtin raised $250-million from investors to buy approximately 400 properties, add basement apartments and turn the houses into two rental units.
Core is targeting eight midsized cities in Ontario, and this year started buying properties in Kingston, St. Catharines, London, Barrie, Hamilton, Peterborough and Cambridge. It will soon start buying in Guelph. Its medium-term goal is to have a $1-billion portfolio of 4,000 rental units in Ontario, Quebec, B.C. and Atlantic Canada by 2026.
Mr. Hawtin said Core's rental units will provide affordable housing for families and residents who do not want to live in small apartments. If Core succeeds, it could spur major investors to follow suit.
Ms. Latafat and Mr. Hawtin believe a major house rental business will flourish in Canada because of decades of low rental vacancy rates, desire for more space and high immigration. They also point out most of the country's population is concentrated around a few job centres.
As well, the pandemic's real estate boom has priced even more residents out of the housing market with rentals as the only option. National home prices are 20 per cent above prepandemic levels, with values 30 per cent to 50 per cent higher in parts of Ontario, B.C., Quebec and the Maritimes. The typical price of a detached house in Guelph and nearby KitchenerWaterloo is now more than $800,000, according to the Canadian Real Estate Association. That is about $200,000 more than a year ago.
Economist David Rosenberg said an affordable rental house could become more attractive to a potential home buyer because house prices are so high.
"The ratio of home prices to rental rates is so extreme that new entrants to residential real estate will gravitate to the rental market," said Mr. Rosenberg, who leads Rosenberg Research & Associates, adding that if more potential buyers are forced to rent, that could eventually reduce competition in the residential real estate market and slow home price increases.
Ms. Latafat said Core chose the eight Ontario cities because they all have strong local economies, are close to larger job centres, have growing populations and low housing vacancy rates.
In Barrie and Guelph, the rental vacancy rate is closer to 2 per cent, according to Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. data.
Meanwhile, in the first year of the pandemic, rental rates have increased in the high single digits in Barrie, Guelph, London and St. Catharines, according to CMHC.
"They have tight vacancies, like zero vacancies," said Mr. Hawtin. "Immigration is growing, population is growing and buying a house or a condo has become less and less attainable. That is really compounding the rental demand in all of our marketplaces," he said.
So far this year, Core has spent $50-million on 75 properties, the executives said.
Their two-bedroom basement apartments go for about $1,600 a month and a threebedroom above-ground unit at about $2,100 a month. Those prices are higher than the average rental rate of $1,407 for a two-bedroom apartment in Ontario, according to CMHC data. Though Core's rentals are newly renovated units in houses with gardens.
Institutionalized family home rentals got their start south of the border, after the U.S. housing bubble burst in 2007 and companies bought thousands of houses at fire-sale prices. Companies and their investors now own swaths of U.S. neighbourhoods and make money on the rent, similar to apartment building owners.
Toronto-based Tricon Residential, one of the largest operators of single family home rentals in the U.S., said Core's decision to split the properties into two rental units makes sense given the price of houses in Canada.
"The problem in Canada is that homes are so expensive," said Tricon chief executive officer Gary Berman, whose company has wanted to bring single family home rentals to Canada for years but has concluded that it is unworkable owing to the high real estate prices.
Tricon owns about 24,000 detached houses in 18 major U.S. cities. Most are in warmer climates such as Orlando and Phoenix. Mr. Berman said that makes the houses easier to maintain compared with Canadian properties, which have to withstand long, harsh winters.
Tricon keeps its purchase prices below US$350,000 a house and rents the entire property for about US$1,500 a month. Mr. Berman said the key to the business is scale, saying Tricon aims to have at least 500 rental houses in each city.
Core is also trying to build scale and is buying houses within 15 minutes of each other to form a cluster of about 50 properties or 100 rental units in each city. Ms. Latafat said it has taken Core about one month to rent their new units and their vacancy rate is below 2 per cent. She declined to comment on when the rental business would be profitable except to say that the rental units were "cash flow positive," about five months after they were purchased.
Mr. Hawtin said he expects to start fundraising for the next stage of the rental business as soon as next year and may consider going public at some point.

Full text: Real estate development professionals are warning that Toronto's program of conferring heritage protections on dozens of retail storefronts in historic neighbourhoods could stall investment in some of the areas most suited for adding residential density.
At issue is an evolving and expanding sense of what heritage is for, which is in tension with other Toronto planning policies that restrict multifamily residential developments to the city's commercial avenues, while also making it difficult to win approval for the middle-scale buildings that planners and residents claim to prefer to high-rise towers.
"The reality is our Planning Act and the Heritage Act are all about sense of place, so that you don't come back 20 years from now and say to your child, ‘I grew up in this neighbourhood but I don't even see anything that I recall,' " said Tamara Anson-Cartwright, the program manager for heritage planning at the City of Toronto. It was her team that recommended 54 new additions to the heritage register (approved by city council on May 5) that are clustered along the Leslieville retail strip on Queen Street East and Carlaw Avenue. Critics of this batch-listing, and others before it, have picked on some examples that seemed less-than-stellar examples of architecture or history, but that misses the point, according to Ms. Anson-Cartwright.
"Heritage is not just about the big monuments anymore, it's about context and an important understanding of humanity." But beyond subjective questions of taste, for some, Leslieville is a prime example of an urban neighbourhood with existing surface rapid transit - and a proposed Ontario Line subway stop - that makes it ideal for adding new housing.
"Toronto is physically built out. The official plan directs growth and intensification to a relatively small and well-defined area of the city, while placing significant protections on large swaths of residential land," said Blair Scorgie, a registered professional planner and Leslieville local who sent his own submission to the city warning that the effect the heritage designation could be to raise costs too high for any potential developer. "It isn't simply a question of what the market can take. It is also a question of the degree to which the decisions we make contribute to the ongoing erosion of housing affordability in what has quickly emerged as one of the world's least affordable urban centres," he said.
Looking for validation of his thesis, Mr. Scorgie approached Chris White, a partner in the development consultancy UrbanMetrics Inc., to run the numbers for one of the biggest sites in the Leslieville heritage batch: a Value Village location at 924-926 Queen St. E., an unusual Lshaped lot that includes a large surface parking lot off a laneway.
Mr. White's report suggested you could accommodate a six-storey apartment building on the site and, given a fairly conservative timeline, it would be possible to make a profit. But he found that the heritage listing would push the budget to the limit, which might mean you could build essentially luxury townhouses and condo apartments, but it would be unlikely to work financially if there was any requirement for affordable housing.
"At the end of the day, you can't have your cake and eat it, too," Mr. White said. "With the multifaceted nature of urban development, you can't have heritage preservation, you can't deliver affordable housing and you can't have all the community amenities you're talking about."
Jack Winberg, chief executive officer of Rockport Group, builds mid-rise residential in Toronto and has done so with projects that include heritage protections, including a new project, at 2100 Yonge St., called the Davisville, that will incorporate a heritage façade into a 12-storey building. He warns against anything that adds costs to the alreadychallenging building type.
"There's no economies of scale in mid-rise, so the buildings are more expensive than tower buildings," Mr. Winberg said. For example: "In most cases I can't use a hammerhead crane [the kind you'll see on a 20storey or more building], I have to use a luffer; that takes 20 per cent more time. A 12-storey building needs two elevators, a 40-storey building only needs three." Also, each heritage structure will have a different budget for preservation: For his Montgomery Square building, where Rockport put a 27-storey tower above a historic postal station, Mr. Winberg said one of the major costs was a $2-million steel structure to hold the façade in place while work went on.
"Mid-rise has got all of these factors, and heritage is very much potentially the straw that will break the back," he said.
Advocates for affordable housing noted in submissions to the city that 1,300 main-street properties have been added to the heritage register in the past four years. The fear is the heritage listings will shrink-wrap entire avenues, sealing them off from any new development.
Ms. Anson-Cartwright disputes that notion, pointing out the Leslieville batch listing only covers 20 per cent of the strip's frontages. "That means 80 per cent could be new, and you can still build on top of the 20 per cent of street-wall that is protected." And while 1,300 new heritage addresses may seem like a lot, her team has examined many times that number, close to 8,000 locations, and many more were rejected than added.
"We've done our due diligence; we're looking at individual buildings, we're not just throwing 500 addresses up for the sake of it," she said.
At present the city is consulting with communities for 10 more potential heritage districts, including Bloor West Village, Danforth Avenue (Broadview to Coxwell), Mount Dennis, Parkdale Main Street and Scarborough Centre.
Preserving the fine-grain retail of a strip like Leslieville's Queen Street East would seem desirable, but Mr. Scorgie points out that streets behind that strip experience the side effects of neighbourhood planning restrictions: the gentrification of duplexes, smaller houses and rooming houses that are being purchased and converted to large, expensive single-family homes.
"Our neighbourhoods ... have experienced decades of population decline. It is happening quickly, and it is contributing to the socio-economic polarization of our city. The introduction of mid-rise development, on avenues such as Queen Street East, represents a redistribution and rebalancing of growth," he said.
"I am not an expert in land economics or cultural heritage preservation. But I see what is happening, and I cannot help but sound the alarm. Something has to give."

Full text: Seven minutes and 17 seconds is not a lot of time. But in the movie-junket landscape, seven minutes and 17 seconds talking with a bona fide phenomenon like Lin-Manuel Miranda is considered an eternity. Even better: Miranda is one of those rare Hollywood denizens who approaches each and every media interview as if they were his own personal speed-talking challenges. He is a mile-a-minute pontificator who crams 20 minutes of conversation into half that duration.
To mark the release of the new film In the Heights - based on Miranda's hit 2008 Broadway musical focusing on the gentrifying New York neighbourhood - The Globe and Mail spoke with the erstwhile Alexander Hamilton about creating two theatrical sensations, the art of adaptation and anything else we could fit into approximately 437 exhilarating seconds.
In the Heights has been in development for almost two decades before director Jon M. Chu was brought on board. How did the process of adaptation change over time?
The decision-making was all about space and time.
[Screenwriter and author of the musical's original book Quiara Alegria Hudes] and I are better at our two jobs now than we were in our 20s. She took the first crack at it without me, because she wanted to try some new stuff and said, "I don't know if I'd have the courage to do so with you there." She brilliantly streamlined the musical without losing its essence.
There certainly are characters who didn't survive.
And it's been amazing watching fans of the musical realize that while watching the film and then them screaming at me in real time. But I went through it, too! Although I had several years to process it. But what that kind of thing does is free up other storytelling real estate to develop other themes.
I've always consoled myself by remembering that Herr Schultz and Fraulein Schneider are the two characters I love most in the stage version of Cabaret ... yet they're not in the movie at all. And that film is still a masterpiece! So even with the film being a lengthy 2½ hours, how did you ensure that you got as much of what's essential to the musical into the new reworking?
That tension is real: You have this much money to make the movie and this much time, and also you have 29 songs in the musical. So something has got to give. But I have to give Jon credit because that tension led to some smart creative decisions. We realized, for instance, that I'm not going to be writing any new songs for this, so we need to spend our time fighting for the songs that are there.
The Carnaval del Barrio number is one that, on paper, if you're a studio you're going to cut it because plotwise nothing happens. But it's about a community that rallies up and represents their homelands in a way that's galvanizing. It's what the entire movie is about. But we had one day to film it. The magic you see there is because we knew we had just one day, and it was important to get in and get it right.
I'm also playing the [local vendor character] Piragua Man because Quiara called me and said she thought they were going to cut him. But she had an idea as to how to keep it. Smash cut to me pushing the piragua cart and [original In the Heights and Hamilton co-star] Christopher Jackson playing Mister Softee. That becomes a love letter or Easter Egg to the stage version.
So the push-pull can work both ways.
And not for nothing, the whole original Broadway score is in the movie. Just some of it is orchestral. It's just not always sung or represented the same way.
This is the second film version of your work, but of course Hamilton was a very different sort of cinematic adaptation. How do you think audiences who know you only from Hamilton will react to this?
I do believe that the heart of In the Heights is intact.
Quiara's updates are brilliant and I look forward to people discovering the original Broadway cast album. I see it as an additive experience. Hamilton, that film was a bucket-list thing for me. We spent six years making the Broadway show and then [director Thomas Kail] figured out how to adapt that into a cinematic version while we performed it as a stage production. I feel like I've had complementary experiences.
In the Heights is available on-demand, including Apple TV/iTunes and the Cineplex Store, starting June 10, the same day it opens in Canadian theatres, dependent on public-health restrictions.

Full text: Toronto buyers spent an average of 32 per cent more for houses outside the city than residents of the rest of the province, according to new land transfer data, evidence that Torontonians are contributing to the spike in real estate prices in cottage country and smaller Ontario cities.
Throughout the province, house prices are 20 per cent to 50 per cent higher than they were a year ago, with Toronto buyers taking advantage of low interest rates to buy larger properties with green space to ride out the pandemic.
Realtors in cottage country and the smaller cities have long said Torontonians were driving up the prices. New analysis from electronic land registry company Teranet provides the data that show the extent to which city buyers have helped push up prices on residential properties.
When Torontonians bought a house outside of the city in 2020, they spent, on average, $844,000, according to Teranet. The figure last year for Ontarians as a whole buying a house outside of Toronto was, on average, $638,000, said Teranet, which looked at Torontonians' purchases since the beginning of the pandemic.
The numbers suggest that people from the city have more wealth and pricier tastes, and other buyers are likely forced to look at cheaper properties.
"There are higher-paying jobs in Toronto, so it is easier to go outside Toronto and afford more.
That obviously created competition," said Alexander Kvitnitsky, agent with Justo Brokerage, whose Toronto clients were seeking second properties in cottage country.
In Tillsonburg, prices for detached houses are up 50 per cent, to $526,900 year over year, according to the Canadian Real Estate Association home price index, which adjusts for expensive deals.
"Torontonians have deeper pockets," said Barb Morgan, owner of Morgan Realty Inc. in Tillsonburg, who has sold homes in the area for more than two decades.
"They tend to bid much higher than the local people can afford."
Ms. Morgan said Toronto buyers typically came with their own realtors, who were accustomed to Toronto-style bidding wars. Multiple offers are now common in Tillsonburg and much of Ontario.
In Quinte, which includes the touristy Prince Edward County, the home price index for a detached house is up 47 per cent to $490,100, and realtors say the Toronto buyer is behind that increase.
"That is the only thing that is driving up prices. There is no ifs, ands or buts," said Treat Hull, a realtor who has sold properties in Prince Edward County for almost a decade.
The Teranet study, which analyzed mortgage activity in the provincial land registry, found that Torontonians and the rest of the province spent similar amounts if a condo was involved.
The study found that a Toronto condo owner spent an average of $523,000 on a condo outside of the city last year, compared to the provincial average of $505,000.
During pandemic lockdowns, interest in condos waned as residents grew tired of spending time in a small, confined space. Demand has rebounded, in part because house prices increased to a level that is not affordable for many Canadians.
The study also looked at the migration of Torontonians and found an increase to the Simcoe region, north of the city and closer to cottage country, as well as Durham, to the east.

Full text: Canadian businesswoman Jasmine Hartin looked the picture of success as she stood next to a shimmering swimming pool last month during the grand opening of the Alaia luxury resort in Belize.
Ms. Hartin and her partner, Andrew Ashcroft, the son of a British billionaire, had spent more than five years building the resort - which features three pools, a collection of beachfront cabins and several high-end restaurants - and the May 7 opening was attended by a host of government officials, including Belize's Minister of Tourism.
"For Jasmine and I, this marks the fulfilment of a dream," Mr. Ashcroft said during the ceremony. He added that the hotel was the first of many projects the couple had planned for Ambergris Caye, an exclusive island getaway made famous by Madonna in the song La Isla Bonita.
Ms. Hartin's luxurious life has suddenly come crashing down.
She's now languishing in the notorious Belize Central Prison, awaiting trial on manslaughter charges. Police allege she shot a local police officer in the head last week after a night of drinking.
According to media reports, Ms. Hartin told police the shooting was accidental, but she has been denied bail and it could be years before the case comes to court.
The killing has shaken this small Central American country, where the Ashcroft family has considerable interests, including owning Belize's largest bank. It has also caused a stir in Britain, where Mr. Ashcroft's father, Michael Ashcroft, is a former member of the House of Lords and one-time deputy chairman of the Conservative Party.
Police in Belize have offered few details about what happened in the early hours of May 28, and reporters were barred from attending Ms. Hartin's bail hearing this week, reportedly because of COVID-19 restrictions.
Police Commissioner Chester Williams told a news conference this week that a gun shot rang out at around 12:30 a.m.
Officers found Ms. Hartin walking on a pier with "what appeared to be blood on her arms and on her clothing."
The body of Superintendent Henry Jemmott, 42, was retrieved from the water nearby, along with his Glock service pistol.
Commissioner Williams said Supt. Jemmott had been shot behind the right ear.
The incident "seems rather personal and not an attack," he added. "From what we know is that they are friends. From what we have been made to understand, they were drinking. From the investigation, they were alone on the pier and, yes, they were both fully clothed."
Supt. Jemmott was a 23-year veteran of the police department and had recently been transferred to a unit in the capital, Belize City. Commissioner Williams said Supt. Jemmott had "some personal issues" and had been back on Ambergris Caye visiting friends and fishing.
Local media have reported that Ms. Hartin told police she had invited Supt. Jemmott to her apartment, where they drank and discussed her family's security. During a short walk to the pier, Supt. Jemmott began complaining about shoulder pain and reportedly put his gun down while Ms. Hartin gave him a massage.
When she picked up the pistol and handed it back, the gun accidentally fired.
Other reports have suggested that Supt. Jemmott had urged Ms. Hartin to get a gun for security purposes and that, as she practised handling the weapon, it went off.
Police have not said why Supt.
Jemmott was carrying his gun while on vacation or why it was loaded.
As she awaits trial, Ms. Hartin sits in a grimy cell in the country's only jail. It's home to more than 1,000 inmates and gained notoriety for being featured in the Netflix series Inside the World's Toughest Prisons. The institution is run by the Kolbe Foundation, a non-profit organization that mixes religious zeal with strict rules.
Ironically, Mr. Ashcroft and Ms. Hartin's charitable foundation has been a major donor to the Kolbe Foundation and helped build the prison's Ashcroft Rehabilitation Centre.
Ms. Hartin, 32, has spent at least seven years in Belize, working briefly as a real estate agent selling high-end properties before joining Mr. Ashcroft in the Alaia project. It's not clear how long they have been together or if they are married, but they have two young children.
A resort brochure listed Ms. Hartin as "director of lifestyle and experience" and said she had "played an integral role in shaping the vision for Alaia Belize from the very beginning." The brochure added that she worked "on every aspect of the experience, from the master plan and amenity curation to interiors and social programming."
There's already concern among Supt. Jemmott's family that Ms. Hartin will receive special treatment because of her connection to the Ashcrofts. Michael Ashcroft, 75, spent his childhood in Belize, where his father was a British diplomat, and he returned regularly over the years as he built a business empire in Britain that included the home security firm ADT. He's been a major investor in Belize, largely in telecommunications and financial services, and served as Belize's ambassador to the United Nations from 1998 to 2000. Last year, his company bought the Belize Bank from Bank of Nova Scotia for US$30.5million.
"I think, in my honest opinion, with due respect to [the police], I think they should have took that to court as murder and let the court decide," Supt. Jemmott's sister, Marie Jemmott Tzul, told Belize's News 7 this week. "So why the special treatment? That gives us more pain in our heart to see, because maybe it's a person [who is white], a person with money. ... Jasmine has taken away the family breadwinner. ... My little big brother."

Full text: THE LISTING Other than a few camping trips, Sam O'Connor had only been to North Bay, Ont., on two house-hunting excursions before buying a twobedroom home on almost an acre of land with his partner, Marina D'Apice.
"They think we're crazy," said Mr. O'Connor, reached on the phone in between unpacking the new house. "They" are family and friends from Oshawa and Whitby, where Mr. O'Connor, 25, grew up and was renting with Montrealborn Ms. D'Apice, 29, for the past few years. "When we say North Bay, people from Durham region say, ‘Whoa ... it's cold up there.' But it was the closest thing we could afford to Oshawa and the Durham region," Mr. O'Connor said.
The couple's max budget was $400,000, which might have been achievable in Durham even three or four years ago, but is near impossible when the national average home price is now $696,000 according to the Canadian Real Estate Association.
"We went to see a few other houses in the Peterborough area.
... They were just awful; mould and disgusting houses. And we couldn't even afford those," Ms. D'Apice said. "When we were looking down south, our only option was to buy something with one of our parents or buy a condo."
Wedged between Lake Nipissing and Trout Lake, North Bay - a 31/2-hour drive from Toronto - has been known as a mining town, a military town and a college town.
But these days it has a new description even the locals find hard to believe: A town with a hot real estate market.
In April, the 154-member North Bay Real Estate Board (NBREB) released data showing the first four months of 2021 have broken every record in North Bay real estate history: The number of transactions, at 519, is 55 per cent above the 10-year average.
The 216 sales registered in March were valued at $105-million, double the total from 2020 and the largest monthly dollar figure in the board's history. April saw a few fewer homes sell, but the average home price set a new record, hitting $383,852, up 45 per cent from April, 2020.
"It's a crazy market that I felt I would never see in my lifetime in our city," said Steve Kotan, sales representative for Royal LePage North Bay Real Estate Services and a former NBREB president who was born and raised in North Bay and worked as a realtor for the past 30 years. "We've always had a steady growth year over year, maybe a couple dips here and there as the economy dips, but I've never seen anything quite like this."
North Bay's real estate market is split between the urban and suburban neighbourhoods and the rural and recreational properties on myriad lakes and riverfronts in communities between Lake Nipissing in the west and Mattawa more than 45 minutes east. According to Sue Symons, current NBREB president, the higher value waterfront properties are the main driver pushing overall prices up so quickly.
"It's been a more affordable area, compared to Muskoka [and the Kawarthas]. ... We started seeing prices rise three or four years ago, mainly from out-oftown buyers," she said. "I'm very careful; it can also change in a week. Buyers are here today, but what's going to happen two weeks from now? It's going to depend on the product that's being offered."
For the past three years, Joe Dookie, 56, has been looking for a waterfront property in the north that could serve as a home for his eventual transition into retirement.
"We couldn't find the right house or the right fit, and it became out of reach in the last two years," said Mr. Dookie, who hoped to be able to cash in his four-bedroom house in Bradford, Ont., for a mortgage-free property. "The market just got crazy. ... We couldn't sell this for $700,000 and go buy for $700,000 somewhere else."
Instead, working with Mr. Kotan, he found a 3,000-square-foot home on a country lot that's just more than eight acres in Powassan, a rural community about 25 minutes south of North Bay. Bordered by forest and with a pond on site (not quite the waterfront he was looking for) and a football field worth of grass, the house ticked all the boxes except one: There will be a small mortgage on the property after it took a bidding war to win it. "Things got stupid; those people I was competing with were all from Southern Ontario," Mr. Dookie said.
The good news is they sold their house in Bradford this past weekend and will be ready to move north in August.
Multiple offers on a house, let alone one selling over asking, was uncommon in North Bay real estate until 2020, according to Mr. Kotan. "I recall selling a property around September where there were 14 offers; it sold 26 per cent over list price. At that point, that was the record for non-waterfront single detached home," he said. "That's been left in the dust.
This year, I've seen things go 46 per cent over list price."
And it's not just first-time buyers or recreational property shoppers sniffing around North Bay. According to Ryan Humble, a sales representative with Century 21 Blue Sky Region Realty Inc.
Brokerage and president-elect of the NBREB, there's been a brisk trade in vacant land, an uptick in new developments and even investors looking for multi-family or single-family rental properties that can be purchased much cheaper than rental properties in the Toronto region.
"North Bay has kind of been an unknown secret for a while," he said. "Now, we are seeing a lot of realtors from other areas coming into town, driving from Muskoka, Ottawa, Toronto. There's a misconception that North Bay is further away from the GTA than it is.
... People are realizing now the distance is not as taxing as they thought it would be."
This increased interest in his community is music to the ears of North Bay Mayor Al McDonald, who's been in office for 11 years and has been promoting a population-growth agenda. Remarkably, North Bay's population is the same as it was 40 years ago when it reached 51,000 residents, having peaked at 55,000 in 1990 and having declined to just more than 50,000 in the 2016 census.
"If you own a house in Toronto, you can sell it and get twice the house here for half the price.
Obviously the pace [of price growth] will slow down; you can only raise house prices so much.
But the opportunity for us is, Toronto's always going to be too expensive," Mr. McDonald said.
"I go to Toronto and it costs a fortune to have breakfast or lunch ... here you can have lunch for $10; you're living like a king," he said.
For new residents looking for a $10 lunch, the mayor suggests trying out the local coffee shop franchise Twigg's Coffee Roasters.
In addition to home prices well below the national average, the mayor says North Bay has ski hills, beaches, breweries and all the comforts you'd expect in a mid-size Canadian city.
"When we were in Oshawa we couldn't afford anything, our only option was to keep renting," Ms. D'Apice said. "Moving up here gives us the chance to get started with things."

Full text: 1761 County Road 1 E.
NAPANEE, ONT.
Asking Price: $2,895,000 Taxes: $7,752.45 (2021) Lot Size: 61/2 acres Agents: Paul Johnston, Right at Home Realty Inc.
THE BACKSTORY Linda Corbett and Andrew Fee searched for a country property in Eastern Ontario for about two years before they found the setting they were looking for near Napanee in 2017.
Their search led them to a 61/2-acre parcel of land carved from one of the area's original farms. The site is traversed by a stream and natural spring that cascades over limestone boulders.
"No one has ever lived on this land before," Mr. Fee says.
At the time, the founders of the Toronto-based design firm SOMA Studio were already intrigued by the ways technology was allowing people to blur the lines between home and work.
"We saw that the pace of life was changing - and this was way before COVID," Ms. Corbett says.
The couple spent the first year having a road into the property built, adding a septic system and running underground power lines.
"You can't ruin the landscape by putting hydro poles in," Ms. Corbett says.
A meadow overlooking the Napanee River was an obvious building site, Mr. Fee says. The couple set out to design a rural modern house. "Longhouse," as they call the completed building, was inspired by Canadian historical and vernacular architecture.
"The idea was to build something that looked like it had evolved instead of being dropped on the landscape," Ms. Corbett says.
THE HOUSE TODAY One of the first challenges arose when workers started to dig a hole for the basement and hit solid limestone after five feet, Mr. Fee says.
The pair have built many homes over the past 30 years or so and they know that every project requires some innovation and creative solutions along the way.
In this case, they raised the house using insulated concrete form. The modern technique creates a solid structure with hefty insulation and weatherproofing.
Mr. Fee, a master carpenter, put a full shop in the basement.
The couple also hired local trades skilled in 17th-century stone masonry and traditional timber framing.
"New people brought new ways of working that we would never know," Mr. Fee says.
The completed house - clad in wood siding from Quebec and topped with a steel roof - provides more than 2,700 square feet of above-grade living space in the main building and two wings.
The basement, with 10-foot-high ceilings, adds another 2,039 square feet.
Today, guests and residents arrive to an entrance hall with a mudroom and powder room.
Inside, cooking, dining, lounging and gathering around the fireplace all takes place under a timber frame structure 35 feet high.
The centuries-old timber framing technique allowed the couple to have large glass walls that open up the interior to the landscape, Mr. Fee explains.
And while the wood exterior has a traditional appearance stained in deep charcoal grey, the interior is light and modern.
"It's a juxtaposition that I think makes the design more exciting," Mr. Fee says.
The couple looked to Scandinavian style in creating simple, well-crafted wood doors and cabinets. They chose subtle tones and unfussy design.
"Scandinavian furniture has its roots in rural simplicity so it seemed a natural fit," Mr. Fee says.
The kitchen is designed for serious cooking and casual socializing, with a chef's range, white oak cabinets and a 12-foot-long island.
"I wanted the kitchen to be very much part of the living and dining area," Mr. Fee says.
In the living area, a woodburning fireplace imported from Belgium is set in a surround of handmade Spanish tiles. Doors slide open to an outdoor terrace with views of the river.
Stairs lead to a loft above with two bedrooms, a bathroom and a 28-foot gallery overlooking the living area.
The wing containing the primary bedroom is set a couple of steps down from the main living area and has a cathedral ceiling 16 feet high.
There's a dressing area and an ensuite bathroom with a standalone tub and a walk-in glassenclosed shower.
The bedroom has a wall of windows looking toward the river and a door opening to an outdoor terrace.
"You can see the stars right above you when you're lying in bed," Ms. Corbett says.
The completed house is serene in all seasons, the couple says.
They often see wildlife wandering by and bald eagles circle above the river.
"There's a sense of calmness about it. The whole focus of the house is living on the landscape," Mr. Fee says. "It's like a theatre.
Every day is different."
THE BEST FEATURE Ms. Corbett and Mr. Fee enjoy spending time outdoors in the pastoral setting.
"Our closest neighbour is a shepherd," Mr. Fee says. "He's got 30 little lambs we could watch running around outside."
The landscape includes meadows of hay and wildflowers, a stream with a natural waterfall, and the winding Napanee River.
Mr. Fee created a large river porch, which sits on the edge of a cliff, cantilevered over the water.
Maple and bur oak trees line the drive, and an elevated garden of grasses and native flowers surrounds the house.
Mr. Fee grew up in nearby Kingston and has always admired the many buildings built from local limestone. He obtained some stone from a quarry near the property and had a partial wall built alongside the house.
The folly could be one of the remnants of old stone farmhouses that often appear in the landscape, Ms. Corbett explains.
"Imagine you might have an old limestone ruin because you see a lot of that around here."

Full text: Toronto's housing market slowed in May, the second straight month of declining sales, as buyer fatigue set in and prices fell in two areas outside the city.
There were 11,951 home resales in the Toronto region last month, which was above the 10-year average for May, but 12.5 per cent lower than April. In the city itself, as well as areas west, north and east, sales all declined by double digits, according to the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board, or TRREB. In the previous month, sales fell by 14 per cent.
Across the Toronto area, the average selling price reached a record high of $1,108,453 in May, an increase of nearly 30 per cent over last year, when much of the economy was still shuttered. The home price index, which adjusts pricing volatility, hit $1,045,800, an increase of nearly 20 per cent. But the pace of price increases was about 2 per cent month to month, slower than earlier this year.
"We are not seeing the same level of craziness," said Shawn Zigelstein, a broker with Royal LePage Your Community Realty, who said some of his clients are exhausted from losing out on numerous bidding wars and are taking a break. Although fewer homeowners put their properties up for sales compared with April, the number of new listings was still higher than May of last year.
In Halton, a region just west of the city with wealthier households, the home price index fell 5 per cent to $1,127,900. In Simcoe, north of the city and closer to cottage country, the home price index dropped 6 per cent to $737,500.
However, in York region, where the benchmark price of a home jumped by $120,000 in the first four months of this year, prices continued accelerating, up 2 per cent to $1,144,400. To the east, in Durham and northwest in Peel, prices were either flat or up slightly.
During the pandemic, sales activity in the suburbs and smaller cities have been frenetic, with buyers working from home trying to get bigger, cheaper properties.
But with prices now 20 per cent to 40 per cent higher than this time last year, those areas are becoming unattainable for more residents. That combined with slightly higher mortgage rates, buyer fatigue and more inventory has tempered some of the real estate activity.
"Prices keep on going up and that is kind of not encouraging for buyers," said Paul Singh, a realtor with Justo Brokerage. Mr. Singh, who has closed 40 real estate deals since the fall, said buyers have become a bit more cautious and are saying maybe we should take a break, maybe price increases will stop.
TRREB predicted that home prices would continue to rise with listings down month over month, including for condos in the city of Toronto. That was the only type of property to lose value during the health crisis. The average price of a condo fell by 1 per cent in May after climbing for three consecutive months.
The Trudeau government is under pressure to deal with the housing unaffordability problem that has spread from the bigger markets to smaller ones. So far, Ottawa and the bank regulator have made it harder for borrowers to qualify for a bank mortgage. As well, the federal government is spending billions of dollars on creating cheaper rental and housing units, and has proposed an empty-home tax for foreign homeowners.
Economists do not expect the tougher mortgage stress test to trigger a downturn similar to the one that occurred when Ottawa introduced the initial rules back in 2016 and 2017. But realtors say some buyers are now hesitant, and waiting to see if it will help drive down prices.
In the country's priciest real estate market, the trend was similar.
In the Vancouver region and Fraser Valley, sales were down 13 per cent and 2 per cent, respectively, according to their local boards.
However, prices for all types of properties were higher than the previous month. In the Vancouver region, the home price index for a detached house hit $1,800,600. In the Fraser Valley, it reached $1,323,300.

Firms deal with supply-chain bottlenecks amid recovery

Full text: Canadian companies are struggling with supply chain bottlenecks as the postpandemic economy starts to take shape, squeezing margins and putting upward pressure on prices.
Wholesalers and retailers are reporting months-long delays for shipments from suppliers in Asia. Canadian manufacturers are scrambling to source raw materials, paying elevated prices for scarce commodities and passing those costs along to customers.
Pressure on North American supply chains has been building since last summer. Now rising transportation, storage and commodity prices are showing up in producer and consumer prices, just as large parts of the economy are preparing to reopen and concerns about inflation are on the rise.
The question for importers and central bankers alike is whether these disruptions are temporary, as the network of global manufacturing and trade resets after the shock of COVID-19, or whether capacity constraints and backlogs will feed into more permanent price increases.
"We're speaking to customers that are saying, ‘We haven't had an import container in four to six weeks, prices have quadrupled, and our margins can't really manage that,' " said Jon Chiniborch, vicepresident of sales and marketing at Pival International, a third-party logistics company based in Montreal. "We're not expecting this to change over the next six months." Costs are rising all along the supply chain. The Bank of Canada commodity price index, which tracks 26 commodities, is at its highest level since 2014. In China, the world's consumer goods manufacturing hub, factory-gate prices rose 6.8 per cent year-over-year in April, the biggest jump since October, 2017.
Meanwhile, the cost of shipping a container to the West Coast of North America from China has increased more than 300 per cent over the course of the pandemic - that is, if you can secure a spot on a container ship in the first place.
The strong Canadian dollar is helping absorb some of these increases. But margins are being squeezed and businesses are starting to pass costs along to consumers.
Questions about inflation are now the norm on public company earnings calls. In recent weeks, a number of large Canadian companies, including Sleep Country Canada Holdings Inc., seafood company High Liner Foods Inc.
and toy seller Spin Master Corp., have acknowledged they're raising prices to protect their margins.
"It's very rare that we will absorb any price increases, [and] as people understand there is clearly signs of inflation everywhere, not just in [the manufactured] product, but in our logistics and our labour," Sleep Country chief executive officer Dave Friesema told analysts on a call this month.
Supply chain constraints are hitting smaller companies particularly hard, as they face both higher freight prices and difficulties securing space on container ships.
A survey published last week by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business found small companies plan to raise their prices by an average of 3.3 per cent over the next year, which is the highest reading since data collection began in 2009.
The bottlenecks are not unique to Canada. Over the course of the pandemic, factory closings, commodity shortages and both natural and man-made disasters - including the six-day blockage of the Suez Canal by a massive container ship in March - have disrupted manufacturing and trade.
Auto manufacturing has been hit particularly hard by a global shortage of semi-conductor chips, leading several large car makers to suspend operations at factories in Ontario and elsewhere.
But continuing supply chain congestion is as much about demand as supply. Early in the pandemic, factories slowed production owing to both health concerns and because they expected demand for goods to plummet, as typically happens during recessions. The latter assumption quickly turned out to be wrong.
With lockdowns limiting spending on vacations and restaurants, people began splurging on electronics, home decor and recreational products. Most of these goods are made in Asia, leading to a boom in trans-Pacific shipping and pile-ups at container ports in China and North America.
"You have a scenario where we don't know how to forecast [demand], we have slowed down production ... then there's this rising consumer demand, which we've never seen before, plus the rising demand of e-commerce," said Jérôme Thirion, a partner with KPMG Canada Management Consulting, and head of the firm's national supply chain and operations team. "This is a scenario for which nobody was prepared.
Hence the bottlenecks."
The most visible sign of this is the fleet of container ships bobbing off the coast of California. At peak congestion in February, there were more than 60 ships anchored off Los Angeles, waiting an average of eight days to unload their cargo.
British Columbia's much smaller container ports have seen less dramatic backlogs. But there has been a marked increase in the number of container ships anchored in Vancouver's English Bay and off Prince Rupert in recent months.
Peter Xotta, vice-president of planning and operations at the Vancouver Fraser Port Authority, said the delays are caused by both a jump in container traffic - up 20 per cent in the first four months of the year, compared with the previous year - and ships running behind schedule.
"One of the characteristics across the board on the West Coast is that vessels are not showing up when they're supposed to, mostly because of congestion in Asia," Mr. Xotta said.
Canadian ports have also drawn traffic north from backlogged ports in the United States.
Clothing retailer Aritzia Inc., for example, rerouted shipments through Canadian ports en route to the company's distribution centre in Ohio. It also increased its use of air freight in response to delayed cargo ship sailings, chief operating officer Jennifer Wong said on a recent earnings call.
"These decisions reduced potential delays by 30 per cent to 50 per cent," she said.
The redirection of ship traffic has been great for business at Canadian container terminals, said Robert Lewis-Manning, president of the Chamber of Shipping. But it did lead to congestion across the Canadian transportation system, particularly in the early months of the year.
"It was happening at the same time we were having record grain exports [from late fall through to around March]. So then you get into a battle for the railroads," Mr. Lewis-Manning said.
"The fall period might be interesting if we see a strong agricultural export market again and continued demand for imports through containers. As businesses reopen this summer, the demand for goods is expected to increase so the fall will likely be busy," he said.
Further along the supply chain, changing consumer and business behaviour is showing up in unprecedented demand for warehouse space. Vacancy for industrial real estate in the Greater Toronto Area is at a historic low of 0.5 per cent, and lease rates are up 26 per cent since the start of the year, said Garry Watts, vice-president and sales representative at Colliers International.
"It used to be just-in-time inventory. Now with the disruption in the supply chain, we're seeing companies building and leasing buildings to maintain an inventory, so they can sell from a rack versus an empty rack," Mr. Watts said.
At the same time, the boom in e-commerce is fuelling demand for massive distribution centres.
Amazon alone has leased 12 million square feet of warehouse space across Canada since 2019, and other retailers are scrambling to keep up, Mr. Watts said.
He doesn't expect vacancy in the GTA warehouse market to increase for at least two years, when several new developments are scheduled to come online. In the meantime, companies are having to look further afield, to cities such as Hamilton, for affordable warehouse space.
On the labour side of the equation, costs are being driven by health and safety measures, as well as shortages of workers. In cities such as Vancouver, Mr. Chiniborch of Pival said, "the demand on warehousing is so high that the local warehouse associate can go next door and demand $5 or $10 an hour more because he's a skilled forklift operator, and they're gone."
All of this is feeding into worries about inflation. The consumer price index in Canada rose 3.4 per cent year over year in April, the fastest annual pace of inflation in nearly a decade. Much of this increase was the result of transitory factors, mainly yearover-year gasoline price comparisons to early pandemic lows. But there was a broad-based 0.6-percent increase in consumer prices month to month, which is not explained by "base-year" effects.
At a news conference the day after the April CPI release, Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem reiterated the central bank's position that the current spike in inflation will be temporary, and that persistently high levels of unemployment will pull the rate of inflation back toward 2 per cent later in the year.
Mr. Macklem did, however, acknowledge supply chain constraints and unexpected pockets of labour market strength could cause inflation to run above the bank's forecast. "We've already seen some supply chain problems, we could see more supply chain problems," he said.
When it comes to supply chain capacity, a lot depends on how much consumers pivot back to spending on haircuts, restaurants and vacations in the coming quarters, and away from goods carried on container ships and stored in warehouses.
"We do foresee that it's going to shift in the next 12 to 18 months back to normal," Mr. Chiniborch said. "But consumer spending is still going to be strong for Q2 and Q3. ... And when consumables are up, this means strong imports and container demand."

Full text: 130 Edgar Ave., Richmond Hill, Ont.
SOUTH RICHVALE Asking price: $3,749,000 (February, 2021) Previous asking price: $3.89-million (October, 2020) Selling price: $3,545,000 (March, 2021) Previous selling price: $3,100,000 (February, 2016) Taxes: $16,713 (2020) Days on the market: 35 Listing agent: Stephen Sun and Sam Ahn, Re/Max Realtron Realty Inc.
THE ACTION This four-bedroom house near the Richmond Hill Golf Club fits in with the upscale mansions that are replacing the area's original bungalows in most respects, but its 100-footby-105-foot lot is short on outdoor space.
"Some were hesitant to buy it because they wanted to put a pool in," agent Stephen Sun said.
"The lack of a long backyard, together with being at the corner of an intersection having more cars passing by than usual, made it a bit of a challenge to sell."
In the new year, a price drop and uptick in local versus overseas shoppers improved its prospects. "Because of the price range, people weren't keen on buying sight unseen, so a lot of showings were from local buyers," Mr. Sun said.
"In the end, two buyers were interested and they both submitted an offer at the same time.
We went with the higher offer." WHAT THEY GOT This roughly four-year-old house has many upscale features, from a triple garage and elevator to a professional wet bar, glasslined wine cellar and heated marble floors in the basement.
The ceiling rises 12 feet above the kitchen and living room, with decorative treatments above the study, dining and family rooms.
There are seven bathrooms and four fireplaces, including two double-sided versions.
THE AGENT'S TAKE "The property itself was well built with stone all the way around," Mr. Sun said.
"The original architect did a good job of making the basement a walk out to increase sunlight, as well as positioning the house as close as possible to one side to maximize the remaining lot for a still decent-size yard," Mr. Sun said.

Full text: When a project blends in so well, there is a danger.
In 50 or 75 years, who will be around to tell of the thought that went into it? Who will remember the anecdotal stories that fill in the blanks? Who will fight to preserve it?
At Toronto's Centre for Social Innovation - part incubator, part lab, part co-working space, part tenanted office building, and all in for reshaping the world to become a better place - one such project exists. Here at 192 Spadina Ave., how people enter and first experience the six-storey, 1920 brick-and-beam beauty has been radically changed, but a first-time visitor might not blink an eye.
"There's something about our role as stewards of history," CSI chief executive officer Tonya Surman says. "I think about this building, how easy it would be to sell it and have a developer rip ‘er down and put up a 12-storey condo."
But that, she continues, wouldn't honour its rich history as part of Toronto's once-booming garment district or "show the world that here was a different way - a slower way."
When CSI purchased the building in 2014, accessibility requirements needed attention immediately, since many tenants and visitors are wheelchair users. However, like many other schmatta warehouses, the "ground" floor isn't really a floor at all: Visitors enter from the street onto a thin landing and must choose to climb a half flight up or descend a half flight into a semi-basement. So, one of the first things purchased was a costly key-operated lift platform at the building's side door, which is located partway down a shadowy alley.
"And it's so ugly, it never gets used. It takes up so much space [and] it drives me nuts," Ms. Surman says.
Consulting with tenant Luke Anderson of StopGap Foundation - StopGap manufactures the brightly coloured ramps that turn inaccessible shops into accessible ones - a temporary ramp was built off of the main stair. The problem, says Mr. Anderson - a wheelchair user since a cycling accident changed his life in 2002 - was that "it was very steep and certainly was not designed to local building codes." So, while it did allow "people to independently and spontaneously get in and out of the building," it also caused great distress for Ms. Surman.
"It's the only time in my 17 years at CSI that I truly cried, because my team [said], ‘we need a wheelchair accessibility ramp' and you are giving me the ugliest piece of crap you could possibly imagine and I said, ‘I do not accept that everything accessible has to be as ugly as sin.' " Luckily, Ms. Surman's building is full of heavenly, creative people.
Enter architects David Oleson of Oleson Worland Architects, a tenant of 192 Spadina Ave., and Daniel Hall of the Architect Builders Collaborative, a former tenant at CSI's Regent Park space, who were handed the unique challenge of creating something large, utilitarian, to code and, most importantly, beautiful.
"As I recall, even before the wood itself - I mean the wood just makes it all really special - was to try to make a landscape, to make an interior amphitheatre in a sense," Mr. Oleson says. "And then, when the wood chunks came along, it just made it all come together." And what of this "really special" wood? Well, it belonged to Mr. Hall's client, Dr. Michael Jewett, who, by day, helps save lives as part of University Health Network's oncology team and, by night, rescues century-old beams from demolition sites.
Consulting with the good doctor on a laneway suite for his Cabbagetown residence, Mr. Hall casually mentioned the CSI project, and that reclaimed wood was one of the materials being discussed. Intrigued, Dr. Jewett immediately extended an invitation to visit his farm near Uxbridge, Ont.: Not only did he have various outbuildings constructed using reclaimed wood - a drive shed using glulam beams from the old Valhalla Inn is but one example - he also had, all stacked neatly and labelled, structural timbers from 12 Toronto buildings, most a century old and many taken down during the late-1990s and early-2000s condo boom.
"I started to cart timber up to Uxbridge on the return leg of my local building supply company truck deliveries, so they were deadheading back up, and I would have them pass by a demolition site and load timber," Dr.
Jewett says. "So I am reasonably good on the provenance of this material."
To wit, the stuff he had in mind for the CSI team - which Mr. Hall says he "practically gave away" - had once held up a sturdy redbrick building at the northeastern corner of Dundas Street East and Carlaw Avenue, and another from Charlotte Street. And interestingly, in one of those buildings there was mixture of Southern yellow pine and Douglas fir, which placed its construction at the point where the railways opened up trade with Western Canada (since, before that, Ontarians would bring pine up by water from Georgia or the Carolinas).
Of course, most visitors to 192 Spadina Ave. won't know any of this. They might not even notice how all of that wood creates multiple platforms for laptoptypers or cellphone talkers - without interfering with wheelchairs wheeling their way safely down - or a new area where a someone might address a crowd (says Ms. Surman: "We have storytelling nights, we have speakers, we have all sorts of things").
They won't think of the tears, the architects who brushed them away, Dr. Jewett's passion project, structural engineer David Moses who did the math or McWood Studios who constructed it all.
But if they think it's beautiful, maybe their grandchildren will also, and they'll preserve it when it becomes a century old.
"To me," Ms. Surman finishes with a twinkle in her eye, "it's art as much as it's access."

Full text: DONE DEAL 2810 Erlton St. SW., Calgary ERLTON Asking price: $769,900 (January, 2021) Selling price: $752,500 (February, 2021) Taxes: $5,378 (2020) Days on the market: 33 Listing agent: Kamil Lalji, CIR Realty THE ACTION This 21/2-storey townhouse was the final of four luxury homes completed by local builder Honeyycomb Developments and Toronto-based Designed by Iman last year. Put on the market in January, there were two dozen showings over the course of a month.
The building's unique design helped it stand out. "Nothing was quite like this," said agent Kamil Lalji. But in a tough real estate market in which buyers have the upper hand, solid offers were hard to come by.
"There were a few offers that were really low," Mr. Lalji said, "and then one came in that was a reasonable offer, so we accepted it."
WHAT THEY GOT This 1,269-squarefoot townhouse has nine-foot ceilings on all levels, a 368square-foot rooftop terrace, a private backyard and a garage.
The hardwood flooring is imported from Europe and the open living room has a porcelain-clad gas fireplace.
In the centre of the kitchen is a waterfall-edge quartz island and there is a wet bar off to the side of a recreation area downstairs. The 543-square-foot basement has a third bedroom and one of four bathrooms.
Monthly fees of $226 cover snow removal.
THE AGENT'S TAKE "These homes were built with a level of quality and design that transcends Calgary's current townhome landscape," Mr. Lalji said. Finishes are stylish and sustainable, like the porcelain kitchen cabinetry and backsplash. "It's all vein-matched because it's all from the same piece of material," Mr. Lalji said.
"The upper cabinet was metal to hold the weight of the stone."
"The entire exterior was designed to be maintenance free, so what looks to be wood is a metal or what looks like wood on a deck is a composite plastic. A lot of builders will use wood, which looks good for the first year or two, but if it's not maintained property, it can become an eyesore."

Wineries take heavy blows as pandemic stretches into second summer

Full text: Caroline Granger couldn't imagine a worse year for her small winery.
Ms. Granger said that the pandemic has damaged almost every aspect of the Grange of Prince Edward Vineyards and Estate Winery in Hillier, Ont., which she runs with her daughter.
"I'm a farmer and a worrier and I love to make up all the bad things that could possibly happen and I could never imagine such a perfect storm," she said.
Ms. Granger estimates that in a typical year 50 per cent of her revenue comes from retail sales, either at local liquor stores, restaurants or from wine enthusiasts visiting her farm and purchasing bottles after a tasting.
But Ontario's continuing COVID-19 restrictions have prevented her from hosting oenophiles and the restaurants she partners with are closed for in-person dining. That leaves the LCBO and online sales as income sources.
At the same time, the grapes still have to come off the vine.
Most of the 180 wineries in Ontario are family-run operations with fewer than 20 employees. The Grange, like many of Ontario's wineries, relies on migrant workers to help bring in its crops but travel restrictions have made that challenging.
On top of that, Ms. Granger's usual crew of labourers lives on the Caribbean island of St. Vincent, which was rocked by a volcanic eruption last month, endangering the lives of employees she now considers family.
"Maybe what I should be doing is prepping for a plague of locusts because it's been a pretty wild ride," Ms. Granger said.
According to Vintners Quality Alliance Ontario, wineries in the province's wine-producing regions contribute to 18,000 jobs with a total economic benefit of more than $4-billion a year. Every bottle of VQA wine sold generates $98.20 in economic benefit for the province.
Ontario's larger wineries haven't escaped the financial crush either.
J. Murray Souter, the CEO and president of Lakeview Wine Co.
in Niagara-on-the-Lake, said that about 40 per cent of his business traditionally comes from exports and restaurant sales, two revenue streams that have been evaporated by the pandemic.
He said he hopes that there is some level of reopening to Ontario's economy this summer, but that he recognizes that some safety protocols will stay in place for the foreseeable future.
Mr. Souter said he looks forward to people visiting Ontario's three wine regions - Lake Erie North Shore, Niagara Peninsula and Prince Edward County - this summer as wine tourism generates $850-million a year for the province.
"It's been a desert down there over the past 12 months," Mr. Souter said. "We'd traditionally have five or six thousand people visit our winery over the course of a week in the summer and we haven't had that many over the past year."
Ed Madronich, president of Flat Rock Cellars in Jordan, Ont., said that the pandemic has made him evolve his business model.
"It's forced us to get online, get online quickly, and make sure we're communicating and facilitating people being able to buy our wine," Mr. Madronich said. "We saw a real growth in that particularly at the beginning of COVID, but it's not the same a year later, [sales are] definitely down from last year."
Although Ms. Granger and Mr. Souter operate at different scales, they both said they would like to see the provincial government adjust how wine is taxed in Ontario.
"The reason the Spanish can land a bottle of wine in this country at $7.95, which means they're shipping it out at $2.50, is because they subsidize the industry," said Mr. Souter, who is also the vice-chair of the Winery Growers of Ontario.
"Either create a barrier for them dumping their product here or support us at the same level their governments support their industry."

Ontario cottage country is not out of the woods yet

Full text: It's the traditional start of summer for Canadians lucky enough to have access to a cottage. But this year, the May long weekend will pass with the most populated province still under a stay-at-home order.
There's hope for Ontario's cottage country, though, along with its businesses that rely on seasonal visitors. The province on Thursday announced a reopening plan that could allow camping by June 14. Short-term rentals, which were largely banned under lockdown restrictions, would resume at the same time.
With international travel restricted, there should be few foreigners this summer. But stircrazy urbanites are expected to make up for them.
Gord Baker, the assistant general manager of Algonquin Outfitters, a rental and guiding business, said that last year was a "very busy summer," once it got going.
He says he's expecting the same this year. On some summer weekends, nearly all of the company's 700-plus watercraft are already booked. But there are nagging concerns, including that Ontario's reopening plan relies on achieving benchmarks for vaccination and reduced hospital occupancy. June 14 is a target rather than a promise.
And even if some form of normalcy does return next month, it promises to be a fraught summer.
There's an underlying fear that out-of-towners could bring COVID-19 health risks, and some locals are pleading with visitors to act responsibly. One major cottage rental firm is taking only bookings of at least a week in length, in hopes of not attracting a party clientele.
"There's a bit of dread," said Mr. Baker, the outfitter.
"Before we knew that we were going to be closed for the May long weekend, a lot of our staff here were quite nervous. They were, yes, excited that, okay, we're going to be doing what we're supposed to do. But on the other hand they were kind of nervous. Oh, man, all these people coming from away."
The Canadian wilderness is imprinted on the national mythology.
The rocks and trees of the Canadian Shield north of Toronto were the stomping ground of Tom Thomson and some of the Group of Seven painters. Wealthy residents were journeying to these areas already a century ago, visiting the grand lodges that sprang up to cater to them. Cabins now dot the shorelines of myriad lakes.
Although only a small minority of Toronto residents own second properties of any sort - about one in six, according to Statistics Canada - and federal data show barely one in five of us go paddling even once a year, heading "up north" remains an annual ritual for many families. Some go to their own properties and others rent cabins, pouring money into local tourism economies that desperately need the trade.
A few good summer months can carry the region through the rest of the year. The time from late June to the Labour Day weekend is crucial and those weeks were busy last year. It was a tough year over all, though. Data from commercial real estate firm CBRE show that hotel occupancy in an area known as RTO12 - which includes Muskoka, Parry Sound and Algonquin Park - was down 25 per cent in 2020, compared with the previous year. Locals say that fewer visitors had a knock-on effect, hurting retail and services-oriented businesses.
As the second pandemic summer approaches, there have been casualties. The Olde Stone Brewing Company in Peterborough, in business 25 years, announced in March it was done. The Muskoka Maple Festival last month was cancelled. Others are holding on - nervously.
Businesses are unsure when their regulars will show up, and if COVID-19 rules will discourage those who do come from doing their shopping locally. Rental providers are uncertain if they'll be able to honour their summer bookings.
"We don't know if that June the 14th [reopening] day is set in concrete," said Heather Bayer, chief executive of CottageLINK Rental Management. "Are they going to change the goal posts again?" Her firm, which manages the renting of around 170 properties on behalf of their owners, was in the process on Friday of cancelling or rescheduling dozens of bookings.
"Some of our guests, this will be the third time," she said. "We've moved them from April, we moved them into May. And now we're moving them into the end of June, if they want to do that."
Other businesses, with few customers, are trying to put off hiring seasonal staff but are concerned that their prospective employees will give up and find work elsewhere. Some, with operations mothballed, won't be able to open on short notice even once the government does loosen the rules.
Employees will need to be found, food and drink bought, properties prepared.
Jillian Harrington, chair of the Kawartha Chamber of Commerce & Tourism, said that months of uncertainty over how long restrictions might last have been stressful for many. But one benefit of the pandemic is that it is heightening demand for cottage-country vacations.
"You want to be able to encourage people to come and remember what it's like to be in the sun and have a chat with their friends and experience the water that we have here," she said. "There's so much that we have to offer, we want people to be able to come here and experience those things in a safe way."
Janet O'Connell, the executive director of Muskoka Tourism, says the region has been in a bit of a paradox: unable to welcome people but knowing there is massive interest.
"People are looking for something to do in their own backyard," she said. "Everyone wants to get out of the city and rent a cottage."
That looming demand is causing a mix of expectation and trepidation. The overarching message from locals is that they really want people to come this year, but they want any visitors to act safely.
Ms. Bayer, with the cottage rental firm, said they are insisting on guests who are all part of the same households and are not booking weekends. By having only guests who stay at least a week, they are hoping to minimize those looking to cut loose and get a bit too raucous.
"They're going to want to head out and have some serious celebrations," she said. "Unfortunately, that's not the style that we really wanted at our properties, so we decided that we would not rent short breaks until September."
A number of cottage-country townships also have regulations on their books to discourage - or in some cases ban - rentals shorter than 28 days. These generally predate the pandemic but have taken on added resonance in a summer when many locals want visitors, but not hordes of them.
While such regulations tend to be spottily enforced - it is usually complaint driven - they offer a legal stick for townships to wield.
Blue Mountains, Oro-Medonte and Seguin Township are among the communities restricting short-term rentals.
Seguin Township, at the north end of lakes Rosseau and Joseph, in Muskoka, has banned commercial activity in areas zoned residential since 2006. This includes renting out a cottage.
However, Mayor Ann MacDiarmid says they're not sure if their ban would stand up in court.
They're interested in testing it and this year sent letters to known hosts, asking them to desist from future short-term rentals. Those who ignore the municipality will get further attention, perhaps leading to fines.
She acknowledged that telling people how they can use their properties is divisive but argued there's a greater good to be protected.
"In fairness, some of the people that rent for one and two days from other parts of the world have no idea about fire danger, septic issues, noise on the lakes, safe boating," she said.
"We believe it's our responsibility as a township council to try and keep [encouraging] all those things that have become good cottage behaviour. And it's really hard to regulate when you've got different people every couple of days."

Full text: DONE DEAL 1530 W. 8th Ave., No. 702, Vancouver FAIRVIEW Asking price: $599,900 Selling price: $638,500 Previous selling prices: $315,000 (2007); $195,900 (2005) Days on market: 7 Taxes: $1,480 (2021) Monthly maintenance fee: $299.15 Listing agent: Mike Wilcox, Century 21 In Town Realty Buyer's agent: Shali Tark, Sutton Group West Coast Realty THE ACTION The buyer, a local investor, competed against three other offers and was pleased that the condo unit was already tenanted. "It made the perfect turnkey purchase," the buyer's agent Shali Tark says.
WHAT THEY GOT The condo is in Fairview, near Granville Island and within easy reach of South Granville stores and transit. Built in 2006, the high-rise building has 59 units, most of which are two-bedroom; only six have this one's junior one-bedroom layout.
The south-facing 537 squarefoot space has engineered wood floors, an office nook, gas fireplace, city views and a parking spot. The building allows pets and rentals. The unit currently rents for $1,850 a month.
THE AGENT'S TAKE The last time a unit with the same floor plan sold in the building was in 2016, with a sale price of $817 a square foot, Ms. Tark says. Five years later, this one sold for $1,189 a square foot.
"These units are great investments and do not come available for sale very often." Mr. Tark says.

Full text: Birchview Road LAKEFIELD, ONT.
Asking Price: $5-million Taxes: $13,339.40 (2021) Lot Size: 1.28 acres (208 feet of lakefront) Listing agent: Cliff Liu, Slate Realty Inc.
THE BACKSTORY The word cottage once meant a humble abode, something small and modest. The 10-room lakefront mansion for sale on Clear Lake in the Kawarthas is anything but humble.
When John Masson first saw it, he was delivering furniture to a nearby home. "I saw a for-sale sign and had no inclination to move, but I thought we should look. As soon as I was inside, I said, ‘Man, I love this house.' " That was 10 years ago, and at the time he was the proprietor of the Grey House, a sort-of cottage lifestyle decor store based in Oshawa, Ont. In February he retired, sold the store, and, at the age of 57, is looking forward to the borders reopening soon so he can implement his dream of spending the winter months somewhere sunny and six months in a more modest cottage in Canada.
In many ways, the Clear Lake cottage is the house unlimited overtime bought.
"I was 22 and working at the [Toronto Transit Commission]," recalls Mr. Masson, who drove buses and subway trains..
"Back in those days, you could work an extraordinary amount of overtime. I had my first house paid for by 27 ... I would work pretty much seven days a week; if I could stay awake, I'd work."
The turn to furniture-store owner came about 10 years into working at the TTC. He bought the Grey House as a going concern from the previous owners.
For five more years, he worked at the store during the day and he'd commute from Oshawa to work nights for the TTC.
These days it seems he's finally learning how to relax, describing his favourite thing to do as sit on the boathouse porch with a glass of wine and watch golf.
THE HOUSE TODAY From the front drive the house looks like a 11/2-storey bungalow, clad in dark grey cedar shingles with light trim.
In fact, it is cut into the rocky escarpment and goes down four levels to the lakeshore. And yes, there's an elevator.
Inside, the house is filled with cherry wood: cabinets, trim and all 55 doors are solid cherry, according to Mr. Masson. Almost all the walls are white, all the floors oak hardwood.
The first level has vaulted ceilings and exposed support beams with dormer-style windows. The kitchen, dining room and a massive living room occupy most of this level. The kitchen has a huge slab of tiger-striped granite on an island that has radiant heat beneath. The black cabinets are dark-stained cherry.
The living room faces a wall of windows separated by a railing.
Looking over the railing, you realize the windows travel all the way to the ground floor in a curtainwall of glass facing the lake that gives each level its own stellar vistas.
On the next level down there's a games room and the main bedroom suite. In a wing off to the right the other nine bedrooms begin. There are exterior stairs that you can take from the main deck (off the kitchen) down to the smaller decks on the levels below.
There's an almost bewildering amount of rooms, and spaces to sit facing the lake, with 51/2 bathrooms.
And that's just the main house.
Mr. Masson opted not to list his home on the Multiple Listings Service in order to limit inquiries to serious buyers and keep showings to a minimum. The only place to find details online is on a Strata.ca link. "His neighbours listed their home for sale and there was a lot of showings," listing agent Cliff Liu said. "They feel a lot of people were just treating it like a weekend excursion." THE BOATHOUSE These days you couldn't build this structure on Clear Lake, according to Mr. Masson. The previous owner spared no expense on the house and boathouse, building both structures out of concrete.
The local planning rules have also changed in the past 10 years, and nowadays getting a twostorey building right on the lake is a no-go. It easily stores Mr. Masson's 23-foot boat and a couple of personal watercraft, but it's not a water slip: a tracked system runs into the lake, where you can put a boat on a cradle that then winches the craft indoors so it stays high and dry all winter.
On the second floor is a deck and a living room with a wall of lakeside windows.
"It's pretty special in the summer months ... you're right on the water."

CPPIB posted record 20% return last year, but missed benchmark

Full text: The Canada Pension Plan Investment Board posted its best-ever annual return - but missed its investment return benchmark by a wide margin, wiping out five years of outperformance.
CPPIB also revealed Thursday that former chief executive Mark Machin, who left after facing criticism for getting his COVID-19 vaccine outside of Canada, received no severance package and had his departure treated as a retirement.
CPPIB said Thursday it posted a 20.4-per-cent return in the fiscal year ended March 31, and closed the year with $497.2-billion in assets. It added $87.6-billion to assets over the course of 12 months.
CPPIB has long compared its results to a "reference portfolio" of passively invested stocks and bonds. In most years, CPPIB's blend of stocks, bonds, real estate, infrastructure, private equity and other specialized investments tops that passive benchmark, and CPPIB reports a "dollar-value added" figure in the billions, owing to its active investing style.
Not so in the most recent year, when skyrocketing stock markets created a benchmark return of 30.4 per cent - a full 10 percentage points higher than CPPIB's performance. That means a dollarvalue-added, or DVA, figure of negative $35.3-billion in the fiscal year - or, in other words, CPPIB's choices of investments subtracted more than $35-billion, versus what would have been produced by a passive portfolio of 85 per cent global stocks and 15 per cent Canadian government bonds.
CPPIB closed the year with less than 30 per cent of its portfolio in publicly traded stocks.
The cumulative five-year dollar-value-added figure is now negative $2.8-billion, CPPIB said, despite a return that averaged 11 per cent annually over the period.
"If we compare our longerterm performance to peers both domestically and internationally ... the total returns, from my perspective, have been very strong," CEO John Graham said in an interview Thursday. "We don't get fixated on one-year performance.
Last year, when the markets were selling off, we had a high DVA number. This year, we had a lower DVA number."
CPPIB's March 31 fiscal year doesn't line up neatly with most other major Canadian pension plans. Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan and Healthcare of Ontario Pension Plan all posted returns ranging from 7.7 per cent to 11.4 per cent for their years ended Dec. 31, while Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System lost 2.7 per cent.
The Canada Pension Plan, founded in 1966, is the primary retirement-security program for working Canadians. The government created CPPIB in 1999 to professionally manage the plan's money. Over time, CPPIB has embraced active management and has used the passive-investing reference portfolio to communicate its contribution to Canadians' retirement security.
The strong Canadian dollar hurt CPPIB's numbers in the year ended March 31, trimming eight percentage points and $35.5-billion from returns. CPPIB reports its results in Canadian dollars, but only 15.7 per cent of the fund's investments are in Canada.
CPPIB reported a 31.7-per-cent return in public equities and 34.4 per cent in its private-equity department. Together, the asset classes represented about 55 per cent of CPPIB's portfolio at yearend. Mr. Graham highlighted the performance of both, saying that in local currencies, the privateequity department returned 52 per cent over the year.
The real assets department returned 7.5 per cent. The energy and resources portfolio - only about 2 per cent of CPPIB assets - returned 45.8 per cent last year.
Real estate, about 9 per cent of the CPPIB portfolio, lost 4.8 per cent.
Mr. Graham said struggles in retail were mitigated by a multiyear focus on logistics properties, which benefited from the switch to online commerce amid COVID-19, and high-quality office buildings, where tenants made payments even as their workers stayed home.
CPPIB's annual compensation disclosure showed Mr. Machin, who left the CEO job on Feb. 25, received $3.98-million, consisting of $625,000 in salary, an annual bonus that topped $1-million, and other long-term and pension compensation.
Mr. Machin is "providing transitional service" to CPPIB until June 15, according to the disclosure. As long as he adheres to non-compete arrangements, his deferred compensation, tied to the performance of the CPPIB fund, will continue to accrue until his awards mature.
CPPIB said Mr. Graham, who previously served as the head of CPPIB's credit department, made $2.95-million in the year ended March 31.

Stained glass shines in Toronto's Greektown: ARCHITOURIST

Full text: Oh, they are so much more than just windows.
But before going into the esoteric, these more-thanjust-windows do need description and context.
Gracing the face of the former Temple Baptist Church at 14 Dewhurst Blvd. near Toronto's Greektown, these windows present themselves in threes: the trio of tall, arched windows under a massive pediment and, flanking them, a cluster of three above each set of double doors that once led parishioners up small staircases to the main floor. And all feature tiny panes of opaque, mottled green glass and textured, semi-transparent yellow glass.
And the way light falls onto - and then dances its way across - the floors of the condominium units at the rechristened Sunday School Lofts by Grid Developments can still inspire a visitor to break into a hymn.
"I think at one point there was talk of new windows because we weren't sure exactly how these would stand up to being taken apart and refurbished," Grid's Justin Aykler says somewhat darkly.
Not meaning to bring this little tour group down - which includes heritage conservation architect Joey Giaimo, COMN Architect's Peter McNeil, this author, and project manager Payam Noursalehi of Oben Build - Mr. Aykler quickly explains that the big window companies Grid contacted couldn't figure out how to reinforce these 1925-era beauties while keeping their historicity, and, even if they could, there was concern about how to warranty a hybrid structure of old and new parts.
And then, as if by divine intervention, Grid found Vito Caputo and his Twins Painting and Decorating, who, all agree, is a misnomer, since Mr. Caputo's company offers full restoration of windows, doors, and even bricks and mortar. Partnered with Hamann Engineering and Tremonte Welding & Ironworks, magic was ready to be made.
While the results are stunning, they do require close inspection.
While a local familiar with the building might decide that only a cleanup or replacement of cracked panes has taken place, in reality a massive overhaul and reconfiguration has been achieved.
To ensure that only the best yellow panes remained, the middle portion of each of the big three windows - let's call them the three sisters - has been replaced with conventional glass, expect where yellow ones travel across to conceal a floor plate that wasn't there before. And within all of that new leading, there are now operable portions on each sister, including, for second floor unit owners, ones consisting of yellow glass. There are also operable portions on the smaller rectangular windows.
Inside the units, owners can not only touch the original stained glass - there is no storm window or other barrier - they can examine the intricate web of thin, superstrong steel that now holds these colourful compositions together. Mr. Giaimo jokes: "The windows are stronger than the wall now."
So what's esoteric? Well, a lesser developer might have chosen the path of least resistance: a bland reproduction with much chunkier mullions for instance, or, perish the thought, suburbansized panes that did away with the intricate patterning altogether. Also, retention of the windows and the first 16 feet of the building's width (meaning entry sequences are left intact) meant other problems ... or opportunities. To wit, no unit in Sunday School Lofts is the same; each must wrestle with the nooks and crannies of heritage, or, in the new bits, how to defer to that heritage.
"This is a nice example of how the façade influenced the design," Mr. Giaimo explains as he looks around a unit on the third floor.
"If you were to start this from scratch, you're not going to give anybody 12-foot-plus ceilings."
"There're a lot of weird quirks inside," Mr. Aykler agrees. "You'll see some low closet heights where we had to go under the stairs, and you'll see some very deep windowsills where it's kind of tricky to place a bed, but for the most part Peter and [design architect] George [Popper] have designed great, livable spaces."
The spaces are impressive.
Even the non-heritage units that face Dew Lang Lane are big and bright and feature massive decks for outdoor entertaining. Penthouse owners behind the big pediment get to interact with the heritage wall, and those on the west side of the building get a sweeping view of the city skyline.
And everyone gets the benefit of a new lobby featuring the complex curves required to make a barrel vault ceiling, which, Mr. McNeil says, not only "takes cues from the heritage façade," it also helps to "lend a sense of arrival and elevate the ritual of going to get the daily mail."
With only a few units left for purchase, one might say this Georgian Classical gem has arrived on the residential scene wearing its (restored) Sunday best. And while some heritage conversions are a series of compromises or push-and-pull with various interest groups, here everyone agrees that things went easy like Sunday morning (with apologies to Lionel Richie).
"There wasn't any struggle with this project at all," Mr. Giaimo finishes. "Justin was on board all the way through, and it's clear, you see it."

Finessing the financials key to Parkdale land trust deal

Full text: Up until mid-April, residents at 22 Maynard Ave.
in Toronto's rapidly gentrifying Parkdale neighbourhood worried about where they would live when their landlords sold the building. But when a community land trust purchased the 36-unit, affordable rental property, residents breathed a sigh of relief.
"When you take the element of fear of a bad landlord away, when you try to work with affordable rents, when a unit is maintained, when a relationship isn't acrimonious - because they shouldn't be, it fosters community," said Lynne Sky, one of the building's 42 residents.
For more than a year, the Parkdale Neighbourhood Land Trust (PNLT) worked to acquire its second affordable rental building, the first having been the building next door.
The community group aims to preserve the stock of affordable rental housing by purchasing buildings when they go up for sale. The properties are then managed by a local charity.
Toronto's overheated real estate market has made competition for rental buildings increasingly stiff, so PNLT comes to a crowded market. Non-profits such as PNLT are also disadvantaged by the difficulty in raising funds and the slow pace of approvals for government programs.
PNLT solved the problem by combining the backing of local investors and donor groups with a community-friendly financial institution.
For the purchase of 22 Maynard, PNLT teamed with Vancity Community Investment Bank, which provided an $8.5-million loan, backed by $2.6-million in loan guarantees from PNLT's donor-investor group.
"We've been seeing buildings come to market and being sold and being lost," said PNLT executive director Joshua Barndt.
Mr. Barndt said that there has been an escalating affordability crisis in Toronto.
The Parkdale neighbourhood has for decades been a haven of affordability west of Toronto's downtown, but in the past 20 years there has been a growing tide of homebuyers, infill builders and investors looking to buy up relatively cheap rental properties and turn them into private homes.
In 2017, PNLT conducted a seven-month study to determine how many rooming houses in Parkdale had been lost. The group's research showed that 28 rooming houses had been converted to private ownership in the last decade, displacing about 350 people.
Throughout the COVID pandemic, the organization has seen the need for safe and affordable housing grow.
"To address this need ... we need to build affordable housing, but we also need to preserve and protect the existing, affordable rental housing that we already have in our communities," Mr. Barndt said.
When 22 Maynard Ave. went up on the market, the land trust decided to purchase it as quickly as it could.
"We knew that if this building sold to a corporation, interested in upscaling or a speculative investor, that these tenants may be at risk of being thrown into a precarious housing situations or homelessness. So we knew we needed to act," Mr. Barndt said.
The financing through VCIB gives the Parkdale Neighbourhood Land Trust the time it needs to secure government funding support to pay off the loan.
"By the bank playing this role to provide a 100-per-cent financing facility, it allows these multiple impact investors to come in a streamlined way ... to sort of fill in essentially an equity component without PNLT having to go and raise their own investment fund or numerous foundations having to do direct loans to the organization," said Trish Nixon, VCIB's managing director of commercial impact banking.
"It really was about providing an efficient and streamlined approach to solve this timing issue and leverage the capabilities of the different players."
Other community groups seeking to support affordable rental in other parts of Toronto and in other provinces have used similar funding models. Shared equity is finding increased popularity; Options for Homes has been active in Toronto for 25 years; Vivacité in Québec is relatively new to the field.
In Vancouver's east side, Hogan's Alley Society Land Trust negotiated with the city to secure areas in the community that could be turned into cultural assets. The group also included marginalized voices in the process so the planned redevelopment did not replicate the historical harm and future displacement of the Black community.
At 22 Maynard Ave., residents come from diverse backgrounds.
Ms. Sky said there are racialized people and immigrants in her building, and the acquisition by the PNLT will help keep her neighbours in an affordable living environment.
"People are starting to look at things a tad differently. We need humans housed, and this is a very appropriate way to go about that," Ms. Sky said.
Anne Marie LaLiberté, another resident, said she is skeptical about PNLT's new ownership of the building, but hopeful the land trust will start working on some improvements soon.
"I guess we'll see how it goes. I do believe that they will come around, maybe within a month or so, and try to start doing repairs. I do believe they will start doing it a lot faster than people might give them credit for. This is a very militant neighborhood.
... You either do what you say or don't say it at all."

Full text: The union for Ontario public sector employees has renewed calls for an outside review of the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System, saying the pension's 2020 loss is part of a longterm pattern of underperformance.
In response, OMERS said Wednesday that an independent review "is not warranted."
The Canadian Union of Public Employees (CUPE) Ontario said that 2020 was "not just one tough year" for OMERS, which posted a negative 2.7-per-cent return in 2020. The union, which initially spoke out when OMERS released that result in February, issued a report Wednesday that suggests OMERS has underperformed its own internal benchmarks, as well as other large Canadian pension plans, for the past decade or more.
CUPE says OMERS's 10-year return of 6.7 per cent is lower than seven other major Canadian pensions, whose returns over the period ranged from 8.5 per cent to 11.2 per cent.
It's also lower than the 10-year internal benchmark of 7.3 per cent. OMERS does not disclose the 10-year benchmark figure in its annual reports, which makes it different from the other plans, CUPE says. CUPE said OMERS provided the figure to the union.
The long-term underperformance can also be seen in the 10 years ended in 2019, indicating the issue is not solely the result of OMERS's performance during the pandemic, according to CUPE.
CUPE has raised questions of OMERS management before, including a lengthy critique of its expenses after it announced its 2018 results. Fred Hahn, President of CUPE Ontario, said the union has engaged with OMERS management and "we kept being told everything would be fine ... we weren't satisfied with that."
Mr. Hahn and other CUPE members who appeared at a Wednesday press conference questioned whether benefits would ultimately be endangered.
"We care about this plan - we want to fix whatever's going on, to provide our members with certainty," said Yolanda McClean of CUPE's Toronto Education Worker/Local 4400.
In a statement, George Cooke, the chair of the board of directors of OMERS Administration Corp., said the board, which is nominated by the employer and employee sponsors of the plan, "continually and thoroughly reviews investment performance, independent of management, utilizing external experts where appropriate."
"Following the 2020 results specifically, we undertook a thoughtful look at our investment strategy and past decisions with an open mind," Mr. Cooke said in the statement. "We are confident in our strong new leadership team and have concluded that our current investment strategy is appropriate. An additional third-party independent review is not warranted."
CUPE Ontario represents 125,000 of the pension's 289,000 active members. Two CUPE researchers authored the report, which was reviewed by PBI Actuarial Consultants of Vancouver.
"Overall, we believe the analysis is sufficient to conclude that OMERS investment performance in 2020 and longer term is significantly lower than other comparable plans," wrote Bradley Hough of PBI.
In 2020, OMERS' real estate investments posted an 11.4-per-cent loss, while the value of its private equity portfolio declined by 8.4 per cent. Its performance also suffered from being heavily invested in dividend-paying oil and gas and financial-services stocks and underweight in technology companies. The fund's benchmark was a gain of 6.9 per cent, so it underperformed by 9.6 percentage points, the biggest margin of the past decade, according to CUPE.

Buyers stung by fierce competition exit the market: NEXT MOVE

Full text: When real estate agent Angela Hogben launched a three-bedroom house onto the Hamilton real estate market with an asking price of $499,900, she braced for an onslaught.
"I had a ton of showings - I didn't get a single offer," says the agent with Re/Max Escarpment Realty Inc. Ms. Hogben listed the house in April with an attentiongrabbing asking price and set an offer date for one week later because that's the strategy that has successfully sold many properties for huge premiums in the city west of Toronto.
In Hamilton, Barrie, Guelph and other Southern Ontario cities, agents who were seeing upwards of 25 offers on some properties and price gains of more than 30 per cent over the past year, are shifting strategies as they adjust to a cooler market.
Stephen Brown, senior Canada economist at Capital Economics, sees signs that bidding wars have calmed and prices appear to be levelling off in the hottest parts of the market. Meanwhile, listings and sales dipped in April from March - likely because sellers are holding off while pandemic stayat-home orders are in place, he speculates.
Ms. Hogben calls the market in and around Hamilton "spotty" these days. As each week goes by, more sellers are watching offer night come and go with a couple of lowball bids - or none at all.
"Agents say, ‘My clients don't want to compete,' " she explains.
Paradoxically, buyers who took a pass on 11 Hayes Ave., on offer night did compete for the house - but only after Ms. Hogben bumped up the asking price to $550,000 the following day.
Three submitted offers, and the house sold for $595,000.
"My clients were surprised it went that high after hearing crickets on presentation day."
Ms. Hogben says many house hunters are wrung out out by the endless rounds of bidding and the ferocity of the competition. After the crushing disappointment of losing out on a few properties, they take a break.
While she understands the fatigue, people who are ready to pounce often find an opportunity, she says.
"I think it's really important for people to know what's going on," she says. "They could have snagged a good deal for Hayes and they didn't."
Ms. Hogben pushes her own buyers to show up on offer night because she believes the best time to strike a bargain emerges when no one else comes to the table.
"I always tell my clients - even though they're burnt out - ‘You're going to go and look at this house.
Because you never know. You might be that one offer.' "She's also pressing sellers to list as soon as they can. The owners of a five-bedroom house with a pool in the smaller community of Binbrook, Ont., were planning to list in July, but Ms. Hogben urged them to sell in April when she sensed the shift in the market.
Ms. Hogben listed the house at 94 Kaufman Dr. with an asking price of $999,000 and received five offers.
"I had two legitimate offers - the rest of them were just junk."
The house did sell for $1.25-million, but Ms. Hogben believes the bidding would have been much more intense in February.
She says lowball bids often seem to arrive from buyers from Toronto who are represented by an agent who doesn't know the territory.
"These agents are coming in saying, ‘I'm going to put in a lowball offer and I'm going to get it.' Well they're not."
Ms. Hogben believes the stayat-home orders and school openings and closings during the pandemic are also weighing on the market as Ontario struggles to contain cases.
Some potential sellers are holding back because of lockdown and fear of variants while buyers are turned off from even looking at houses.
Agents run into complications, too: Ms. Hogben knows of one area agent who was showing a house to a couple while the home inspector worked in another part of the house. A neighbour called law enforcement and the agent was penalized for having people from three different households under one roof.
"They got pegged for a hefty fine," Ms. Hogben says.
In Guelph, Ont., real estate agent Aimee Puthon of Coldwell Banker Neumann Real Estate notes that the average sale price in April was $750,858, which is 36.8-per-cent higher than in April, 2020.
"It's a challenging market in all price ranges," she says, noting that many of the buyers are migrants from Toronto. "They're able to arrive here and pay prices we just haven't seen before."
Ms. Puthon was working with local first-time buyers who recently lost out on a house listed with an asking price of $699,000 when an out-of-town agent brought an offer of $805,000.
One week later, Ms. Puthon found a detached house in Guelph's south end with an asking price of $699,000. Within a few hours, a bully placed an offer so Ms. Puthon helped her clients jump in quickly.
There were four bids in total and, after the dust settled, her clients were successful with an offer of $790,000.
Ms. Puthon says bidding wars were a sure thing for a time, but now the market is more unpredictable.
"Will there be two offers, or no offers, or 15?" listing agents wonder.
Still, lofty prices have her wondering how buyers are able to manage financially. She is recommending that people who are currently looking to buy make sure they are comfortable staying in a property for the next several years. That way, they face less risk if prices level off or dip.
"Markets change," she says.
"You want to be sure that you're staying in the home because that's your five- to 10-year plan."
At Capital Economics, Mr. Brown believes home prices in Canada look increasingly vulnerable to future rises in interest rates.
For now, however, he believes the bigger risk is the potential negative effect that further falls in sales could have on gross domestic product because the country's economy has become more dependent on the costs associated with moving house.

Full text: 270 Indian Rd.
TORONTO Asking Price: $6,395,000 Taxes: $16,671.77 (2021) Lot Size: 50 feet by 248 feet, irregular Agents: Paul Maranger and Christian Vermast, Sotheby's International Realty Canada THE BACKSTORY When James Mountain and Joanne Weaver purchased an arts and crafts-style bungalow on Indian Road in Toronto's High Park area in 2004, people were keen to share local lore about the landmark home.
"The neighbourhood was full of stories about it," Mr. Mountain says.
Amateur historians speculated that the original owner - William G. Harris - was a member of the clan that created the giant Massey-Harris farm equipment company and included the Group of Seven artist Lawren Harris. There were rumours of a bomb shelter in the backyard.
Mr. Mountain's own research uncovered no ties to the more well-known Harris family, but he found that the first owner was a successful businessman who made his fortune as the founder of Canada Metal Co. Born in Muskoka in the 1800s, William Harris moved to Toronto at the age of 17 and began to earn his living by collecting scrap metal in a cart.
William Harris operated a factory that manufactured materiel during the First World War and went on to supply lead alloys to the printing industry. By 1922, Canada Metal was operating across the country.
"He was a wealthy industrialist and a self-made man," Mr. Mountain says. "His story in its own right is quite interesting."
With his business established, Mr. Harris hired the architect F.S.
Mallory to design a new house in High Park in 1924.
Many decades later, Mr. Mountain and Ms. Weaver were living farther down Indian Road when they first admired the home, which stood out for its swooping roofline and demi-lune bay window with leaded glass.
They kept an eye on it for several years, hoping the house would come up for sale.
"Joanne had her heart set on the property," Mr. Mountain says.
Eventually Mr. Mountain heard through the neighbourhood grapevine that the owner might consider selling.
The couple asked their real estate agent to ring the doorbell.
After some negotiation, they purchased the house before it hit the open market.
THE HOUSE TODAY Mr. Mountain and Ms. Weaver brought in architect Catherine Friis to modernize the home for their family of four.
The couple asked her to reconfigure the layout while also preserving many of the rich original details.
Today visitors arrive to a long walkway which leads to a front porch and an entry door with a leaded glass window and side panels. Inside, the vestibule has a patterned tile floor and the interior door has a stained glass window with stained glass side panels.
The foyer, panelled in wood, has a barrelled ceiling. The original oak staircase is reminiscent of the Victorian era, with an elaborate balustrade.
The living room, with the bow window and a wood-burning fireplace with a limestone mantel, overlooks the street. The formal dining room has walls paneled in wood, two built-in china cabinets, a coffered ceiling with oak beams, and a seating area built into the square bay window.
While the principal rooms retained their proportions, smaller rooms at the rear were reconfigured to create a large open kitchen and family room.
Today the kitchen has traditional cabinetry painted in French blue, an eight-burner gas range and a commercial-grade zinc steel countertop. In the family room, residents can relax in front of the wood-burning fireplace. An oversized door opens to a covered porch at the rear.
Some former bedrooms on the main floor were converted so that Mr. Mountain and Ms. Weaver each have their own study with built-in shelves for books and art.
A former solarium became the mudroom, with a porcelain tile floor and wall-to-wall closets.
Upstairs, double doors open to the couple's suite at the rear, with large bedroom windows overlooking the garden. There are two dressing rooms and two bathrooms.
Ms. Weaver says she rejected Ms. Friis's plan for each of the parents to have their own bathroom at first, but the architect persuaded her that it would make it easier to rearrange the space.
Now Ms. Weaver is glad that she agreed.
"It's the best thing in the world to have your own bathroom," she says with a laugh.
There are two other bedrooms with ensuite bathrooms on that level, and a fourth bedroom, and a main bathroom.
The lower level has a wine cellar, a media room, a hobby room, a recreation room and a home gym.
Ms. Weaver says the house has been a wonderful setting for charity events and parties over the years.
The couple's catered Christmas party brought all of the neighbours together nearly every year.
"That was a big event that everyone looked forward to and we loved doing it," Ms. Weaver says.
Now the couple have become empty nesters and more young families have moved into the area. There's a Montessori school nearby, High Park a couple of blocks away, and the Bloor subway line at the top of the street.
"Once they were out of Grade 6 they went everywhere on their own," Mr. Mountain says of the couple's two kids.
The neighbourhood has also been transformed over the years as many large houses that were once carved up into apartments have been restored as single-family homes.
"Lots of these big, regal houses have had renovations done to them," Mr. Mountain says.
Mr. Mountain says the couple have made few changes to the house after their extensive renovation, except to redecorate some of the rooms and refresh the paint colours. At the time, they were careful to choose finishes and materials that would not look dated after a few years.
"Generally the house has stood up extraordinarily well. It was a restoration but it was a functionally modern home," he says. "It has a strong character."
A year or two after they moved in, the couple received a letter from a grandson of the original owner. The man, who was in his eighties, was reminiscing about growing up nearby.
He also gave the couple a photograph of Mr. Harris standing in front of the brick façade while the home was under construction.
Next to him was a metal object, which the grandson explained was a time capsule. The photograph was taken to commemorate the day in 1924 that the capsule was sealed inside the structure.
"There's a time capsule still buried in the corner of the house," Mr. Mountain says. "Of course the great mystery is, what's in the time capsule."
One puzzle was solved when the couple asked the visitor about the subterranean room in the back. It had long been sealed up and they left it that way.
Had the metal industry tycoon really built a bomb shelter?
"That was my grandmother's cold cellar," the grandson said.
THE BEST FEATURE The ravine lot is terraced at the rear. Tall conifers, Japanese Maples and flowering shrubs surround the garden beds. With one-half acre of land, there's plenty of room for kids to run around.
"It's a stunning backyard because it's L-shaped," Mr. Mountain says.
Today there's a three-car garage which the couple had built after they purchased the property. They've also added a 100square-foot potting shed which is currently used as an art studio.
"This was a wonderful house to raise a family in," Ms. Weaver says.

Weathering steel having its day in the sun

Full text: In the rush to renovate, landscape and generally make homes more conducive to, well, being at home, owners and contractors have watched demand and prices spike for all sorts of commonly used building materials and plants. Some, in fact, are now in short supply.
The question is whether it's possible to find alternatives that are, if not necessarily less expensive, then at least available as well as distinctive.
Some homeowners and designers are looking to a rugged material that certainly predates the pandemic, and will provide a gritty sensibility: weathering steel.
Long used in heavy infrastructure or industrial applications, including bridges, railway cars and shipping containers, this type of steel, known by the brand name Corten, is fabricated using special alloys that produce, over time, a kind of rusty-looking armour that prevents corrosion and eliminates the need for painting.
In the late 1980s, Corten began to gain recognition for its aesthetic properties thanks to the work of artist Richard Serra, whose monumental sculptures frequently used Corten, and local architects Brigitte Shim and Howard Sutcliffe, whose ground-breaking 22-year-old Don Mills project, Weathering Steel House, won a Governor General's Award. It's become somewhat more commonly used in both residential and landscaping projects as designers gain a greater appreciation of how this material ages. "It has this [aubergine] patina that develops over time," Ms. Shim says. "We now know what 35-yearold weathering steel looks like."
Jason Halter, owner of Wonder Inc., has worked extensively with shipping containers in residential contexts, and is now employing weathering steel for the exteriors of a handful of current projects, including a West Queen West semi-detached house at Beaconfield and Afton avenues. That renovation involved adding a thirdfloor onto the end unit of an Edwardian row house. The exterior walls, and a mansard roof required by the planning department, are clad in vertical seam quarter-inch Corten.
Mr. Halter points out the reddish-orange of the weathering steel complements the traditional red brick prevalent in older Toronto neighbourhoods, and notes that its corrosion resistant quality creates a kind of sustainability not found in more typical or older cladding materials. "No matter how beautiful a piece of architecture is, from the day it's completed it begins to weather and deteriorate so picking resilient materials is obviously critical."
In residential projects, Ms. Shim adds, designers have to think carefully about how to use Corten because of its chemical properties. It can react when placed next to some other types of metal, and also tends to bleed, at least initially, which means allowing water to drain off a Corten surface into a planting bed or a gravel surface. "You have to think about drainage," she says. "It requires a level of knowledge in terms of how you put things together."
Mr. Halter has used Corten in landscaping as well, for example a long and narrow planter/water feature that traversed the back of a garden. While some designers are installing low weathering steel retaining walls to define front yard gardens, landscape architect Janet Rosenberg prefers to use Corten in more vertical contexts, as such as a privacy screen/fence around an outdoor seating area in Rêve, a Tridel project. Set against yellow and orange foliage, she says this material can be stunning, but should be used sparingly. "That's why it's so beautiful: you don't see very much of it."
But metal fabricator James Maxwell, who owns Maxwell Design, points out that some of the steel plates showing up in gardens may just be ordinary steel that's been allowed to corrode naturally.
He built a pair of front-yard steel planters last year, and is watching them age with interest.
"I like the patinas and oxides because it shows the passage of time," he observes. Rust, as a famous Canadian balladeer once sang, never sleeps. The steel, adds Mr. Maxwell, "is going to do what it wants to do."

Full text: 3 Northridge Ave., Toronto EAST YORK Asking price: $1,395,000 (March, 2021) Selling price: $1,622,500 (April, 2021) Taxes: $5,445 (2021) Days on the market: six Listing agent: Jose Arias, Royal LePage Signature Realty THE ACTION With few listings for detached homes in East York this spring, the sellers of this two-storey house had the advantage.
About a dozen showings were quickly arranged and four visitors returned on the offer date with bids in hand.
"A lot of newer homes on the market at the time were around the $1.8-million or $1.9-million range, so this was difficult to price and compare because it was a bungalow that was topped up," agent Jose Arias said.
"In that neighbourhood, semi-detached homes can easy go for $1.4-million, so that being said, we priced it there to see where the market would take us."
WHAT THEY GOT This former mid-century bungalow was topped up and redesigned about 10 years ago as a larger and more modern space with three bedrooms upstairs, three full bathrooms, and open living and dining areas with hardwood floors.
The kitchen offers easy access to a recreation area in the basement and a two-tiered deck overlooking the private backyard.
THE AGENT'S TAKE "The sellers thought they were going to stay there forever, they had no plans on moving whatsoever," Mr. Arias said.
"Buyers would have noticed it was a very well cared for family home."
Two cars can park on the 31-foot-by-115-foot lot, which is also in a pedestrian-friendly spot.
"The home - which backs onto the local school park - is a couple of hundred metres to the Dieppe Park complex with a hockey rink, ball diamond, multipurpose sports field and children's playground and splash pad," Mr. Arias said.
"It's nice deep and wide lot," he said. "It's also on a nice, small street in East York that runs north south, so you don't get as much traffic."

Full text: Born April 18, 1940, in Zbarazh, Poland; died March 9, 2020, in Toronto, of gastric cancer; aged 79.
Sidia Cowen rarely complained, had a remarkable capacity for empathy and never judged others for she knew everyone has a story. Hers began when the Nazis entered Zbarazh in 1941, ultimately herding its Jewish citizens into a ghetto. Sidia's parents hid from the Nazis in the attic of a barn belonging to a Polish family. Others also seeking shelter there feared the infant would betray their location. So Sidia was left at a local convent where she would remain for years frightened and alone. Later in life, she remembered the relentless hunger and having to crawl on the floor searching for crumbs to consume.
By the time her mother found her after the war, Sidia believed herself to be Roman Catholic and thought this strange woman was just someone who desperately wanted a child. Those doubts would linger for decades to come. Although her life had been saved through the remarkable grace, kindness and bravery of others, the scars of that deliverance remained.
Her father died as the war ended and, eventually, her mother remarried. They moved to Munich, Germany, and prospered. In Munich, Sidia would attend the local movie theatre where she became entranced by the glamorous movie stars in their sophisticated attire, which led to a lifelong love of style, jewellery and elegance.
While in Munich, the family shared a partitioned apartment with other tenants, one of whom had been a ranked Nazi officer. The juxtaposition of their newfound comforts and their recent destruction was too much to bear. Her parents chose to emigrate. Everything was left behind except for the memories and damage that had been inflicted.
In 1951, the family settled on a farm near Kemptville, Ont. Life and school were hard for Sidia, who spoke no English. She was relieved when her family moved to Toronto, where they befriended other immigrant families.
At 13, she met the handsome and charismatic Joseph Cowen at a house party. She was impressed by his confidence and charm, while he noticed her style, kindness and laugh. They soon began dating.
Joe would pick her up from school on his motorcycle and (since her parents did not speak English) attended her parent-teacher interviews. That connection would form the basis of their love for the next 66 years.
Sidia and Joe married in 1958 and would have three children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Family was Sidia's greatest joy and it served as a powerful antidote to the trauma she had endured. She adored celebrating any occasion with a home-cooked dinner and an abundance of cakes. The gooier, the better. It was as if the sweetness could somehow erase the bitterness of her earlier years.
Sidia started a career in real estate at 58 and would remain at it until well into her 70s. She loved Palm Springs, Calif., where she felt at peace among extended family.
Time, stress and worry dissolved there and the cloak of "outsider" fell away. One of her happiest moments was an intersection of Palm Springs, The Cheesecake Factory, a granddaughter's wedding and a hot fudge sundae: essentially nirvana to Sidia. She described the moment as "orgasmic," which the family found hysterical as that language was quite out of keeping! In a world where kindness is suspect, Sidia taught us to always be kind. She had come to learn the power of acceptance.
The fears and doubts that had been encoded in her DNA as a child were outweighed by a remarkable resilience, strength and will to live. For those gifts her family will be forever grateful. I hope that somewhere she is a child, not again, but for the first time, laughing, playing and, of course, eating cake.
Brenda Cowen is Sidia's daughter.

Full text: Police on Sunday gave the goahead to the annual Jerusalem Day parade, a flag-waving display of Israeli claims to all of the contested city, despite days of unrest and soaring Israeli-Palestinian tensions at a flashpoint holy site.
Monday's parade was scheduled to pass through Jerusalem's Old City, part of East Jerusalem, which was captured and annexed by Israel in the 1967 Mideast war.
The march was approved amid continuing clashes between police and Palestinians in the Old City, the emotional epicentre of the long-running conflict, and in a nearby Arab neighbourhood where Jewish settlers are trying to evict dozens of Palestinians from their homes.
Before dawn Sunday, thousands of Muslim worshippers skirmished anew with police at the gates of the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound in the Old City. Videos on social media showed Palestinians hurling water bottles and rocks at officers, who fired stun grenades.
Amos Gilad, a former senior defence official, told Army Radio that the Jerusalem Day parade should be cancelled or rerouted away from the Old City's Damascus Gate, saying "the powder keg is burning and can explode at any time." Israel's public broadcaster Kan said the final route of the parade had not yet been decided.
The site, known to Jews as the Temple Mount and to Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary, is considered the holiest site in Judaism and the third holiest in Islam. It has been a tinderbox for serious violence in the past.
Dozens of Palestinians were wounded in violent confrontations with police in Jerusalem overnight from Saturday to Sunday, when Muslims marked Laylat al-Qadr, or the "night of destiny," the holiest period of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan.
On Friday, more than 200 Palestinians were wounded in clashes at the Al-Aqsa Mosque compound and elsewhere in Jerusalem, drawing condemnations from Israel's Arab allies and calls for calm from the United States, Europe and the United Nations.
The violence has threatened to spread. Early Sunday, Gaza militants fired a rocket into Israel, prompting an Israeli air strike on a post belonging to the ruling Hamas militant group in response.
Later Sunday, Gazan protesters affiliated with Hamas launched incendiary balloons into southern Israel, setting off dozens of fires that closed roads in the area.
And toward the evening, Israeli police clashed with hundreds of Arab students at Israel's Hebrew University in Jerusalem, using stun grenades to disperse the crowd. Police said protesters threw stones and three officers were wounded, and three people were arrested.
In Jerusalem, meanwhile, Israeli police clashed with hundreds of Arab students at Israel's Hebrew University, using stun grenades to disperse the crowd.
Police said protesters threw stones and three officers were wounded, and three people were arrested.
Pope Francis said he was following the events in Jerusalem with worry. "I pray that it be a place of encounter and not of clashes, a place of prayer and peace," Francis told the public gathered in St. Peter's Square for his traditional Sunday noon remarks.
"I invite all to find shared solutions so that the multireligious and multicultural identity of the Holy City is respected," Francis said.
"Violence only generates violence," he added, calling for an end to the clashes.
Jordan's King Abdullah II, who acts as custodian of Jerusalem's Muslim holy sites, condemned what he called "Israeli violations and escalating practices" and urged Israel to halt its "provocations against Jerusalemites." The statement issued by the palace said he also called on Israel to halt the planned evictions in East Jerusalem.
In the Jordanian capital of Amman, some 700 protesters marched near Israel's embassy, calling on the government to deport the ambassador and annul a 1994 peace treaty with Israel. Security forces prevented protesters from reaching the embassy, and about 10 protesters were arrested.
Addressing a cabinet meeting, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday that Israel "will not allow any extremists to destabilize the calm in Jerusalem.
We will enforce law and order decisively and responsibly."
"We will continue to maintain freedom of worship for all faiths, but we will not allow violent disturbances," he said.
On Sunday, COGAT, Israel's Defence Ministry body controlling crossings with the Gaza Strip, said it had suspended entry of 350 Gaza merchants until further notice because of the upsurge in violence. It also closed Gaza's waters to local fishermen, a common move in times of heightened tensions.
Police spokesman Eli Levi said Sunday that there were no plans to call off the Jerusalem Day parade, despite the rising friction and the potential for violence. He said police were constantly assessing the situation.
Monday afternoon's march marks Israel's capture of East Jerusalem and is typically attended by hard-line nationalist Israelis, who wend their way through the Damascus Gate of the Old City and through the Muslim Quarter to the Western Wall, the holiest site where Jews can pray.
The annual event is widely perceived as provocative, and this year's parade comes at a particularly volatile time.
Adding to the tensions has been legal proceedings by Jewish settlers to evict dozens of Palestinians from their homes in Sheikh Jarrah, an Arab neighbourhood in East Jerusalem.
The Supreme Court had been expected to issue a decision Monday - coinciding with Jerusalem Day. But on Sunday, the court, citing the current "circumstances," postponed the decision and said a new date would be set in the next 30 days.
Palestinians and international rights groups portray the planned evictions as an ongoing campaign by Israel to drive Palestinians from traditionally Arab neighbourhoods, especially in the heart of Jerusalem. Israel has cast the Sheikh Jarrah evictions case as a mere real estate dispute.
The neighbourhood has been the scene of regular confrontations, particularly during Ramadan, between Palestinian residents and their supporters on one side, and Israeli police and ultranationalist Israeli activists on the other.
The flare-up in hostilities comes at a crucial point in Israel's political crisis after long-time leader Mr. Netanyahu failed to form a governing coalition. His opponents are now working to build an alternate government. If they succeed, Mr. Netanyahu would be pushed to the opposition for the first time in 12 years.

Full text: 96 Undercliff Dr.
TORONTO Asking price: $1.899-million (Sold for $2,239,970) Taxes: $8,372 (2020) Lot size: 50 feet by 150 feet Agents: Jen Tripp, Homelife/Realty One Ltd.
THE BACKSTORY Despite working as a gardener for the City of Toronto for many years, Jen Vanderweerd had never been to the Scarborough Bluffs area until her family moved there six years ago.
"Now it's my favourite space in the city. We're so close to the water," she said.
Her house on 96 Undercliff Dr.
is across the street from Scarboro Crescent Park, and in the winter, when the leaves are off the trees, there's a clear view of the lake from her front porch or balcony.
"By the time my kids were 5 or 6 I could just send them out the door [to the park]. I could yell at them from the front deck. It's a wonderful place to sit and watch storms come in off the lake."
Undercliff Drive is aptly named as a treed slope rises up behind the houses on the deadend street. A walking path at the end of the street comes out to the local school, Chine Drive Public School.
"I love the setting, we're really close to a meadow ... there's deer all the time, we see foxes on the regular. I love being outdoors and being surrounded by nature; you feel like you're in a retreat," Ms. Vanderweerd said.
THE HOUSE TODAY The professional gardener's house makes its first impression with a front yard that scorns a monoculture lawn with natural plantings and river-stone pathways. "I like to joke that I'm a lazy gardener. ... I like to use really hardy species that don't require a lot of maintenance. I like a lot of ornamental grasses and things that are valuable in terms of wildlife. I have a really lovely big bluestem grass - a cultivar of a native grass - it has beautiful purple seed heads in the fall," Ms. Vanderweerd said.
Behind the non-lawn is a house dominated by windows; the second floor has glass walls behind glass balconies, and the ground-floor foyer is also all glass.
Off the long living room - tiled in slate and anchored by an oversized fireplace of painted white brick - is a three-piece bathroom.
This space has been a gym, the kids' playroom and a number of other things over the years, but is now the overflow TV room used when the family can't agree on the evening's entertainment.
At the back of the central hall, the staircase curves up to the second level, and if you tilt your head up, you can see a cut-out in the ceiling that allows light and air to flow between floors.
The house is arranged in wings connected by a central hall. Behind a second-floor powder room is the breakfast room, which has a huge sheet of steel on one wall for hanging art with magnets; the opposite wall is coated with chalkboard paint.
Oversized shelves guide the eye to the kitchen, which has a large central island with dark granite and bar seating. A set of large glass French doors open onto the rear deck (which steps down to the hot tub). These two rooms are tiled, where the rest of this level has light oak strip hardwood throughout.
The formal dining room opens to a large open living room, which is the main TV zone, and a set of sliding doors opens to the balcony that runs across the front of the house. On the other side of the house is a family room with another access to the balcony and the second of three fireplaces. "We used to have a record player - this was the chill-out room: We'd listen to records and have fires," Ms. Vanderweerd said.
The stairs in the central hall curve upward again to the third level and its four bedrooms. At the top of the stairs is a bathroom, with bold red tiles on the walls, shared by the four children, all girls. The primary bedroom suite has a large ensuite bathroom with a slate-tiled shower and, rather practically, the washer and dryer.
The other three bedrooms house the couple's four girls: "It's been bed bingo. ... We've tried all sorts of different permutations."
The largest of the three is set up for the twins to share (though they now want separate rooms); the second largest has its own office workspace facing the front of the house.
THE BEST FEATURE "My favourite spot in the house is the window seat. That is where I sit and have coffee in the morning and wine in the evening," Ms. Vanderweerd said.
The couple created a customized deep bench, with storage below, at the front of the main hall on the second floor.
"I insisted on this; I've always romantically loved the idea, and it was a perfect opportunity to make a window seat."
The space is flooded with light on three sides, and captures what makes the house work.
"It's how open and spacious it feels ... so much light that comes into the house," she said.

House movers face roadblocks to recycling

Full text: Most people accept recycling as a necessary part of their routine. And yet instead of recycling perfectly livable houses, we freely demolish thousands each year. That's hardly sustainable.
Last year alone, about 4,000 houses were demolished in the Vancouver region, and an estimated 80 per cent of them had at least 50 years of life left in them, according to Jeremy Nickel, president of Nickel Bros, a structural moving company based in Port Coquitlam, B.C. Heritage advocates note that about one-quarter of that number are houses from Vancouver.
"In the Vancouver area, it's where the greatest amount of demolitions are occurring, and the least amount of moving," said Mr. Nickel, who runs the company with his brother Allan.
Their father founded the company in 1956.
Mr. Nickel has lobbied governments to divert significant construction waste from the landfill by saving houses and relocating them to other areas. But his efforts have been stymied in recent years. As policies push for increased density, he says the problem has exacerbated.
Mr. Nickel is speaking out because in his 40 years of doing business as a major recycler, he's never had so much difficulty doing his job. It's not for lack of demand - there is a market for the houses. He's seeing a greater number of bureaucratic obstacles. As a consequence, he says he is relocating fewer houses in the Vancouver region than he was a decade ago.
He estimates that hundreds of houses between Granville and Cambie Streets, from Southwest Marine Drive to West 16th Avenue, are fenced off and boarded up, awaiting demolition. He is seeing developers purchase large groupings of houses to rezone to a higher density.
But part of the discussion should be a plan to recycle houses, to make it easier to do so.
"I have to tell you, that all the politicians, and many people I've dealt with for years, lobbying them and working with every level of government, they all say [the] same thing - that we have to divert solid waste from landfills. And currently, the demolition debris from houses being demolished is more than 40 per cent of all landfill waste. That's the highest it's ever been.
"And then you take [the] price of wood and how precious our trees are. Say, a 40-ton building that's demolished, which is on the lighter side, that's 60 to 80 trees to replace that wood that ends up being mulched up and then thrown into the garbage dump."
One major obstacle is the delay in obtaining a demolition permit needed to move a house.
And the Vancouver Park Board has made it more difficult to move a house through waterfront parks. Mr. Nickel has long depended on access to the parks to move the houses onto barges.
One park in particular that he used was Fraser River Park, in South Vancouver.
Ian Stewart, manager of park development for the Vancouver Board of Parks and Recreation, said that Fraser River Park and "most shoreline parks in Vancouver are not appropriate locations to facilitate this process."
Reasons given include cultural and archeological concerns, stability issues, protection of walkways and boardwalks, and an aging underground infrastructure.
The park board has suggested Nickel Bros finds another means to access the waterfront.
"We are no longer in a position to accept the associated risks with such commercial operations," Mr. Stewart said.
Nickel Bros is also a big presence in Washington State, where he said it's easier for them to carry out their recycling. The Americans have been the beneficiaries of many of our unwanted character homes. He's moved about a dozen arts and crafts homes from Oak Bay municipality on Vancouver Island to Friday Harbor, on the San Juan Islands, where a subdivision of recycled character houses has been growing for the past several years.
This past week he surveyed routes to move 11 houses and cabins from B.C. to Point Roberts, Wash.
Despite Seattle's difficult topography, he's moving more houses there than Vancouver, because the system has more of a preservation mindset, and what he calls a more pro-active approach to recycling. He got a call from the City of Portland because they, too, want to recycle and resell displaced buildings.
"You think of all the challenges we are faced with in terms of homelessness, and affordable housing, the environment, the lack of wood products - all of these things point to the solution being we need to preserve the current inventory of houses," Mr. Nickel says. "If [local governments] are going to a higher density, then let's talk about a plan."
In North America, moving and recycling houses and also selling them is a unique business model. Mr. Nickel can't think of another house-moving company that sells houses, which they list on their website. The website lists several homes for sale, all structurally sound, he says.
There's a classic 1928 craftsman bungalow in North Vancouver with stained fir floors, ceiling beams and trims and stained glass windows. The lovely fourbedroom character home is listed for $119,500, and that includes the cost of moving it within five kilometres. That doesn't include any barging cost.
The house is labelled "time running out." Other houses on the site are labelled "price reduced," "sold" and "demolished." They are just a handful of houses that Mr. Nickel is attempting to save.
He figures the houses typically sell for within 5 per cent of the listed price. One house in the U.S.
they sold, a 6,000-square-foot mansion, was assessed at $3.2million and will be brought to Canada. It had been listed on their website for $800,000.
Vancouver has a green demolition bylaw for houses built before 1950. Otherwise, there is no minimum requirement to reuse and recycle demolition materials.
There are things that municipalities could do, such as offer developers a couple of units of more density if they save the original houses, he says. Another challenge he faces is moving the houses before they become neglected and vandalized, which is what happens when they sit empty while the developer awaits permits. In Vancouver, a developer must obtain a development permit before beginning demolition work. In order to move a house, Nickel Bros needs a demolition permit to prepare and deconstruct the basement and place steel beams under the house. But because it can take eight to 24 months to obtain the permits, the house falls apart by the time they are obtained, making the houses unsalvageable. By then, everybody in the neighbourhood is happy to see the house torn down. Mr. Nickel says that wouldn't happen if the city made an exception for houses to be moved and saved, and issued a demo permit early on, separate from the building permit.
Long-time heritage consultant Don Luxton said relocation isn't their first choice, but it is often necessary to conserve them.
"Any obstacles to relocation imposed by bureaucratic rules means that more heritage buildings will be demolished," he said.
"Even harder on historic buildings are the many building code requirements that require us to strip them to the studs to meet envelope and energy performance standards.
"We often have no choice, despite the incredible waste of perfectly good materials."
And with so many requirements to update the house, all that's left is the structural frame.
All the old growth fir and oak used for the siding, the floors and the trim gets mulched. Original windows are tossed. What's left is a mere replica of the original house that lacks the original features. Heritage houses are so stripped of original details that heritage advocates now have a name for it: volumetric preservation.
The wastefulness is also happening in Langley and Surrey, where he's seeing houses that are only 15 to 20 years old coming down at a "staggering" pace.
"What is strange is that we have more political support than ever before, and we have more public support than ever before," he says. "It's time word gets out.
I'm trying to emphasize that everybody sees it's the right thing to do, but we have more obstacles than ever before."
Mr. Nickel says he's spending a lot more money on legal fees and his own time because of all the bureaucratic barriers.
"Most of these houses in Vancouver will get demolished as a result."

Full text: When Darrell Parsons recently tried to buy a mobile home in Erin, Ont., northwest of Toronto, at the listed price of $269,000, the seller's real estate agent told him his unconditional offer was unacceptable, and he would have to wait for all the other bids.
The home sold for $312,000 a few days later. It's standard practice for realtors to list a price below what the seller really wants in order to spark a bidding war, but the listing did not specify a bidding date. In any case, Mr. Parsons took exception. "It was bait and switch," Mr. Parsons said. "Realtors are tricking people to come in."
The 60-year-old Mr. Parsons filed a complaint with the province's real estate regulator, saying the sale was unprofessional and unethical. "How is this legal? They list an amount and I try to buy it. They don't show an auction in their listing," he said in his filing with the Real Estate Council of Ontario (RECO). "The buyer is deceived about the price and if they want to continue, must bid and wait and see if it was high enough."
But RECO told him the realtor did not break any rules, and the listing price is not an offer to sell at a particular price but, rather, an invitation for buyers to submit offers.
"If a seller makes the decision to undertake a particular marketing strategy, such as choosing a particular asking price or setting a future date for offers, they are free to do so," the regulator said in an e-mail.
As Canadian home prices spiral out of control, long-standing realtor sales tactics are coming under fire. Blind bidding, in which prospective home buyers don't know what their competitors are offering and winners often blow past their budget and the second-highest bid, is being blamed for driving up prices.
So is the practice of setting an artificially low price to draw in crowds of hopeful buyers, increase the number of bids and pump up the offer price.
"They are chumming the water," said Andy Yan, a housing expert and director of Simon Fraser University's city program. "The issue is fairness. Was there ever any intent to sell at that price or was it just to feed the pricing frenzy."
Economists - and even realtors - have blamed such sales tactics for helping to drive soaring prices, and called for reform. "A review of local market practices should occur to ensure that a seller's market doesn't turn into a runaway market due to practices that can jawbone buyers, like price-baiting or gaming the lack of transparency on the bid process," Toronto-Dominion Bank chief economist Beata Caranci said.
Realtors are prohibited from making false, deceptive or misleading statements under provincial rules governing realtors, but that does not apply to listing prices. Underpricing a property is considered a marketing technique, according to RECO.
"These are marketing strategies that have positive and negative results depending on the circumstances, but it is ultimately the sellers that make the decision," RECO spokesman Brian Buchan said.
Blind bidding is also considered a selling strategy and, ultimately, the decision on whether or not to use it is up to the seller, according to RECO.
The regulator opened 674 complaints in the first three months of this year, its highest level for that period and an increase of 38 per cent over the same period last year. RECO said the top complaints included the handling of the offer process and undisclosed commission reductions.
In today's overheated real estate markets, an underpriced home can draw upward of 50 private viewings in a week. Houses are routinely selling over the asking price - in some cases, more than $800,000 over. Sellers, of course, love the higher prices that come with bidding wars.
For Mr. Parsons, the asking price of the mobile home was at the high end at $269,000, especially since it was located on leased land and the unit could not be renovated. "What drives me crazy is the realtor is the one [who's] telling the homeowner to lower the price to increase traffic, and then when they sell it over asking, they can brag that they are a great realtor when in fact they lowballed it," he said.
Mr. Parsons said, in hindsight, he should have also filed a complaint with the Competition Bureau, an independent federal law enforcement agency whose purview includes false advertising.
Under the Competition Act, businesses are prohibited from making materially false or misleading claims to promote a product, service or business interest.
The Bureau considers a claim "material" if the general impression it conveys leads someone to take a particular course of action, such as buying or using a product.
"It's the general impression conveyed by the advertising that matters," said Denes Rothschild, partner with Borden Ladner Gervais LLP, who specializes in competition issues. "My assumption is that the bureau has found that the general impression conveyed by a list price is that it's just a starting price and that the seller won't necessarily sell for that price, based on how home buyers know the market works."
The Bureau said it received 2,134 deceptive marketing complaints from April through September, 2020, which was on track to surpass the previous full fiscal year's total of 3,226 complaints.
The law enforcement agency would not say how many involved real estate, citing confidentiality reasons.
In any event, the last time the bureau pursued a case against an individual realtor for misleading advertising was in 1978, and it involved false claims about the condition of the house, furnace and wiring, not the listing price.
The ambiguity of listed prices in today's red-hot markets has home buyers guessing at how much over asking they should bid.
Sabrina Piccirilli and her fiancé made an offer of $915,000 on a suburban Toronto house late last year that was listed for $899,000.
The seller's agent told them "it was not going to cut it."
"I was so insulted by that," Ms. Piccirilli said. "I thought, ‘Well, you listed it for $899,000 and we are offering $915,000. What the heck do you want?' I did not know it was a game."
The couple looked at about 30 houses. Many were priced artificially low by sellers and their agents. "They wasted our time," Ms. Piccirilli said.
Anthony Anichini, a realtor based north of Toronto, said one of his clients wants to sue or file a complaint against him and a seller's realtor for false advertising.
"The customer feels the current marketing strategies are illegal, deceptive, a waste of everyone's time and against accepted Canadian advertising standards," said Mr. Anichini, a rep with Royal LePage Premium One Realty. His client threatened to sue after viewing numerous underpriced Toronto area homes that sold well over asking.
"Imagine you spend two weeks looking at 20 different homes, you find one or two that you like and the [asking] price is not the price. It is extremely frustrating," he said.
Even if artificially low listing prices and blind bidding are the norm, Simon Fraser's Mr. Yan says that doesn't make it right.
"At the heart of it, it goes to the transparency and accountability of real estate sales," he said.

Don't expect the pandemic's dramatic remote-work shift to be permanent

Full text: The dunes and vineyards of Prince Edward County have attracted weekenders from Toronto for decades. Sharon Armitage has often been their real estate agent. She sold to the political pundit David Frum and the restaurateur Jamie Kennedy.
But Ms. Armitage has never seen anything like the "avalanche" of city-dwellers who have turned up in the past 12 months.
It's not just aspiring wine moguls ("grapers") or wealthy retirees any more.
Young families who can work remotely during the pandemic have been pushing home prices skyward - by more than 30 per cent since last year.
"It's crazy down here!" Ms. Armitage said. "But it's crazy everywhere."
She's right on both scores: What's happening in The County is part of a familiar trend in Canada and across the world that has seen urbanites leave expensive downtowns for leafy suburbs and smaller cities because of this year's work-from-home revolution.
The question now is whether the flight from cities, and the corresponding real estate boom in newly favoured precincts, will last.
As vaccination brings Canada closer to the end of the pandemic, despite a crushing third wave, some economists and urbanists are skeptical. They believe we have already reached the high-water mark of remote work and that some snap back is inevitable, as offices reopen and people remember the joys of urban living postpandemic.
Whether they're right will help determine the fate of communities, the look of middle-class life, and billions in home equity, for decades to come. Ms. Armitage sides with the skeptics. She's waiting for the "comeuppance," when some of the craziness will subside.
"I don't see how it can continue," she said. "My son keeps trying to buy back into the market, and I just say, ‘Hang on, Freddy.' " Some forecasters are still betting on a more permanent rearrangement of white collars - whole nation-states among them.
This year, sun-dappled Greece began allowing expatriates to halve their income tax for seven years in a bid to lure newly unshackled office workers. "If you can work from anywhere, why not work from Greece?" beckons a promotional slogan.
Ireland is hoping the same forces will reshuffle people within the country's borders. The national government recently announced plans to revitalize moribund rural districts by encouraging office workers to relocate from Dublin, with promises of better broadband and financial support to help local authorities create remote working hubs.
But these incentive packages also suggest the limitations of working from home.
If a flight from Irish cities was happening organically, for example, "they wouldn't have to be incentivizing it," said Ronan Lyons, an assistant professor of economics at Trinity College Dublin.
One hard cap on the mobility of labour after the pandemic will be the nagging persistence of the office. Massive firms such as Google and HSBC have announced they plan to experiment with a hybrid work model after the pandemic, with employees splitting their time between the office and home. Canadian tech leaders including BlackBerry chief executive officer John Chen say they expect a hybrid model to become common.
That lines up with people's preferences in survey after survey: Statistics Canada recently found that among new teleworkers, about 40 per cent wanted to spend half their work hours in the home and half outside of it after the pandemic, far more than any other option. Just 15 per cent said they wanted to work from their kitchen tables full-time.
Bosses are even less enthusiastic about a fully remote future. Many still believe in the creative and team-building power of communal bricks-and-mortar spaces.
In a recent paper, the economists Jose Maria Barrero, Steven Davis and Nicholas Bloom drew on their own survey of thousands of Americans to show that employers expect just a fifth of working hours to be completed from home after the pandemic.
That still represents a huge increase over life before COVID-19, when Americans spent only 5 per cent of their working time at home. In that sense, the remote work revolution appears here to stay. But a hybrid model - whether it lands on one, two, or three days a week in the office - will still sharply limit where employees are able to live. Laptop jockeys who have answered Greece's call may yet find themselves called back from Santorini for bi-weekly meetings in a Mississauga office park.
Less frequent commutes could still allow office workers to venture further outside of city centres than before.
The French newspaper Le Monde reported in March on the trend of young Parisian families moving to smaller outlying cities, with one member of the couple taking occasional day trips into the metropole for work.
The calculus may be different in Canada.
Whereas most Parisians live in apartments and have easy access to the hinterland by train - making the "allers-retours" lifestyle both tempting and feasible - Canadians have less reason and fewer means to manage that sort of shuttle.
About 60 per cent of Canadian citydwellers already live in houses, for example, according to Statistics Canada. (The figure is 57 per cent, including semi-detached and rowhouses, even in dense Toronto.) The relative spaciousness of the country's urban housing may dampen the urge to seek greener pastures in some rural fastness.
Meanwhile, high-speed trains zip between Bordeaux and Paris in a little over two hours, but commuting from the wine country of Prince Edward County to Toronto - a journey about a third as far - takes at least as long by car. For many people, making that trip a few times a week will be prohibitive.
With mass vaccination against COVID-19 on the horizon, the Toronto-based urban theorist Richard Florida already sees signs of city populations rebounding from their slight pandemic lull. His friends who left New York for the warmth and space of Southern Florida this year are now saying, "This was a great four-month vacation."
They miss the excitement and amenities of big-city living, with concerts and restaurants on the verge of returning at full strength.
"I think you're going to see this summer in the United States a big return to cities," he said. "I call it the ‘Roaring 2020s.' " Toronto is particularly immune from a remote-working reckoning because of how central it is to the country's economy, argued Mr. Florida, a professor at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management. As the epicentre of Canada's financial, entertainment, and tech sectors, Toronto is like Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York rolled into one, he said, and represents about 20 per cent of Canadian gross domestic product. (New York accounts for well under 10 per cent of U.S.
GDP, by contrast.)
"There aren't a lot of substitutes for life in Toronto," Mr. Florida said.
Another driver of population growth and red-hot real estate markets in Canadian cities will also come surging back after the pandemic: immigration. Canada welcomed about 180,000 permanent residents last year, the lowest number since 1998, largely because of travel restrictions. But the federal government has committed to increasing immigration levels in the years with a target of more than 400,000 annual newcomers between 2021 and 2023.
New arrivals to the country will almost certainly continue to congregate in big cities such as Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal even in a remote-working future, because of the presence of cultural communities, and because many immigrants take jobs that can't be performed from home, said Carl Gomez, chief economist and head of market analytics with CoStar Group, a commercial real estate information company.
It will take a massive postpandemic exodus, meanwhile, to outdo the existing trend of Canadian city residents leaving for outer suburbs and nearby small cities.
Even before COVID-19, about 50,000 residents of the Greater Toronto Area left for other parts of the province every year, according to a recent report by Ryerson University's Centre for Urban Research and Land Development.
House sale numbers suggest the flight to cheaper parts of Southern Ontario did accelerate as the pandemic wore on, said Mr. Gomez - and it stands to reason that more people will be willing to commute twice a week from Guelph than five days a week. But a slightly sped-up suburban drift hardly means the end of labour geography as we know it.
The upshot in many cities will be a "donut effect" of slightly reduced density downtown coupled with growth in the suburban fringe, argued Dr. Bloom, a professor of economics at Stanford University and co-author of the working-from-home paper. That marks a genuine change, but nothing as dramatic as the idea of "working from anywhere" suggests. The majority of people who move thanks to remote work policies will not land in Greece or even places like The County, so much as the suburbs.
Housing prices in big cities, meanwhile, will likely revert to where they were 10 or 20 years ago, said Dr. Bloom - hardly a "cataclysmic" outcome. Eventually, cheaper homes downtown could even begin to lure some people back from the suburbs, with their laptops in tow.

Don't call it a bubble: CANADA'S HOUSING BOOM

Full text: If it makes you feel better to say Canada's housing market is a bubble, go ahead and say it. Everyone else has.
Ten years ago, The Economist magazine concluded Canadian real estate was grossly overvalued.
Nine years ago, Merrill Lynch declared Canadian housing was afflicted by "overvaluation, speculation and oversupply."
Seven years ago, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and the International Monetary Fund began sounding sirens about the dysfunctional state of Canadian housing. And a year ago, the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp.
warned home prices could fall 18 per cent as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.
What did this multiyear outburst of public shaming accomplish? Absolutely nothing. Canadian home prices marched relentlessly higher.
The latest surge - a 10.8-per-cent jump over the past year to March, according to the Teranet House Price Index - extends a long saga of persistent gains in the face of unrelenting skepticism. Another popular benchmark, the average selling price on the Canadian Real Estate Association's MLS system, shot up by 31.6 per cent in March compared with the same month in 2020.
So maybe, just maybe, we should be cautious about throwing around that bubble label. Have Canadian real estate prices surged upward at an unsustainable pace in recent months? Absolutely. Are lofty prices leaving the economy vulnerable to future threats, such as unexpected interest rate increases and other possible shocks? For sure. But is Canada's housing market an epic bubble on the verge of popping?
Not so fast.
Economists usually define a market bubble as a sudden rise in price based on obviously implausible or contradictory beliefs.
A bubble, in other words, is doomed to collapse under the weight of its own irrationality.
By that standard, Canada's real estate market looks less bubblelike than exuberant. Beneath the frenetic behaviour of the past few months is a market that is reacting predictably to unusual stimulus.
The recent gains in home prices, at least until January, were largely a mechanical response to falling interest rates and tight supply, says Stephen Brown, senior Canada economist at Capital Economics, an international consulting firm. He points out that five-year fixed mortgage rates fell by half between February, 2019, and February, 2021. For buyers who exceed government down payment requirements, the decline in borrowing rates boosted the price they could afford by 22 per cent.
Since January, prices have become more detached from fundamentals, Mr. Brown says. But he notes that demand remains robust and mortgage underwriting standards for new home buyers are still high. Whenever mortgage rates do start to rise, he would not be surprised to see prices in some of today's hottest markets fall by 10 per cent or so. However, he regards a full-scale crash as unlikely.
"The message from the Bank of Canada has been that rates are going to be lower for longer," he says. "In that environment, housing should continue to do fairly well."
At least in some areas, strong fundamentals in recent years have laid the foundation for optimism. Consider the red-hot southern Ontario market.
From 2015 to the start of the pandemic in early 2020, home prices in Toronto soared more than 50 per cent, according to Teranet.
A broad swath of the province - from London to Kitchener to Niagara - enjoyed similar gains.
Mike Moffatt, an assistant professor at the Ivey Business School in London, Ont., says the biggest single factor behind the rapid gains over those five years was an unexpected jump in Ontario's population that created a persistent mismatch between supply and demand. During that period, the province added nearly a million people, many of them foreign students and temporary foreign workers. The increase was out of all proportion to the 600,000 or so newcomers in the previous five years. It exceeded even the most optimistic official forecasts. Policy makers were caught by surprise and failed to ensure the province's supply of housing was in line with the influx of people.
"It was completely unanticipated," Prof. Moffatt says. "Projections had called for growth of maybe 700,000 people during that period. But for a whole variety of reasons - higher immigration targets, perhaps an antiTrump effect making Canada look more attractive, the oil price crash in Alberta - Ontario's population grew faster than anyone expected."
The population surge pushed young couples out of Toronto in search of affordable housing. It transformed sleepy southwestern Ontario towns such as Tillsonburg, Ont., into unlikely hot spots for real estate speculators. Now a somewhat similar story is unfolding, but this time on a national level. Cities and towns that once regarded real estate fever as a Toronto and Vancouver affliction are coming face to face with their own outbreaks. It's a buying surge that is sweeping through communities from Halifax (where, according to Teranet, home prices have shot up 22.5 per cent over the past year) to Abbotsford-Mission, B.C. (up 16 per cent).
Rather than population pressures, the recent mania reflects financial and psychological factors.
Ultralow interest rates are key. So is the growing pool of cash that is building up in family savings accounts as opportunities for spending dwindle in a lockeddown economy. Added to that is the plausible theory that more and more people will be working remotely and so will require more living space. Finally - and perhaps most important of all - there is the you-only-live-once attitude that seems to feed on itself when too many bored consumers are cooped up at home for too long.
"What we've experienced since March, 2020, is due to a combination of ridiculously low interest rates and white-collar professionals with too much money in their pockets buying up everything from Bitcoin and GameStop stock to vintage hockey cards and real estate," Prof. Moffatt says.
Will real estate go into reverse when the economy eventually reopens and animal spirits subside to more normal levels? No one would be surprised if prices wavered. However, one good reason to bet against any housing collapse is the attitude of key decision makers. Political leaders and central bankers have been cheering on the recent gains. It seems unlikely the powers-that-be would deliberately inflate home prices only to stand back and watch them topple.
This is true not just in Canada but in advanced economies around the world. From Australia to Britain, governments and central banks are attempting to stimulate their plague-stricken economies by doing everything they can to encourage home buying.
Rather than taking away the punch bowl just as the party gets going, decision makers in many countries have been spiking the policy brew with as much happy juice as possible. Thanks to low interest rates and other stimulus measures, home prices are soaring at double-digit paces in the U.S., New Zealand and Australia.
In Canada, Tiff Macklem got the good times rolling last year when he declared "we are being unusually clear that interest rates are going to be unusually low for a long time." The Bank of Canada governor adjusted his rhetoric slightly in late April when he opened the door to an interest rate hike as soon as the second half of 2022. However, he has done nothing to dispel the core message that low rates are going to be with us for a long, long time.
Adam Vaughan, the federal Liberals' Parliamentary Secretary for Housing, also delivered an upbeat message recently when he assured television viewers that Ottawa is not going to do anything that would endanger recent gains in home prices. Even a 10per-cent decline would be unfair, he asserted.
"When you hear the Bank of Canada promising rates will stay low for a very long time and politicians like Adam Vaughan promising to do everything possible to prevent a price decline, you can see why some people decide it really doesn't matter what they pay for a home because it will just keep going up," says John Pasalis, an economics researcher and president of Realosophy Realty, a Toronto real estate broker.
This don't-worry-be-happy attitude concerns Mr. Pasalis. He attributes much of the galloping gains in Toronto and Vancouver home prices over the past several years to persistent underbuilding combined with strong inflows of well-heeled, highly skilled immigrants. But he argues the past few months have seen the market lurch into a new and disturbing phase, in which desperate buyers are paying far more than asking prices. "It's not all irrational what is happening," he says. "But the irrational component, what makes it a bubble ... is that these crazy outliers are becoming the norm.
Everyone is feeling they need to spend $30,000, $40,000 or $50,000 more than what comparable homes sold for three or four weeks ago just to get into the market."
Mr. Pasalis, like many other observers, urges policy makers to push through measures to cool the buying fever. The problem is how to do so without crashing the market - something that would be disastrous at a time when the economy is still grappling with the effects of the pandemic.
So long as the economy remains fragile, policy makers and central bankers seem more likely to feed the real estate exuberance than restrain it. That was demonstrated in the recent federal budget, in which the Liberal government responded to the housing frenzy by introducing a new measure to tax non-resident buyers with vacant homes in Canada.
Few people expect this cautious initiative to do much of anything to cool the market.
More optimistically, new supply may help to restore some sanity. Housing starts surged 21.6 per cent in March to a record annualized pace of 335,000 units. If that trend continues, home buyers may begin to have more choice and the current buying fever could gradually abate. But that will not happen overnight.
In a perfect world, home prices would slowly slide back to more comfortable levels as supply rises.
More realistically, some bumps are likely.
Canada's real estate market now stands at the intersection of two ugly possibilities. In one scenario, home prices plunge. In another, they continue edging higher. Either outcome carries unsettling consequences.
The most dramatic danger is the first scenario: a market crash.
Over the past 30 years, countries such as the United States, Japan, Spain and Ireland have suffered through home price collapses. In each case, a devastating recession and a multiyear slump quickly followed. The obvious lesson for Canadian policy makers? Don't let this happen here.
But supporting further real estate gains results in pain of its own.
Take the effect on productivity, for instance. Today's lofty home prices discourage people from moving to the most expensive locales - cities such as Toronto and Vancouver. These superstar metropolises are centres of economic activity. They are also stunningly productive. Yet rather than welcoming new residents and new housing, they zealously protect the character of many existing residential neighbourhoods
through zoning restrictions and other initiatives that prevent new construction from rising to meet potential demand.
As a result, only a limited number of workers get to participate in those highly productive local economies.
The overall drag from such policies is just beginning to be recognized. In a renowned 2019 paper called Housing Constraints and Spatial Misallocation, Chang-Tai Hsieh of the University of Chicago and Enrico Moretti of the University of California, Berkeley, estimated that exclusionary zoning shrunk the pace of growth in the United States by about 36 per cent from 1964 to 2009. Simply increasing housing supply in hot spots such as New York, San Francisco and Silicon Valley would have boosted average annual earnings for the entire country in 2009 by US$3,685 a person, they calculated.
The effect of residential restrictions in Canada may be just as significant. At the very least, high home prices are breeding social stress as young Canadians shell out increasingly obscene sums to old Canadians for the privilege of owning a house.
Two decades ago, the all-in cost of owning a single-family detached home ate up 40 per cent of an average household's income, according to Royal Bank of Canada calculations. By October, 2020, buying the same home required an excruciating 55 per cent of income.
The vast sums flowing into housing increase financial fragility because families who struggle to keep up with home payments are not well positioned to withstand any economic shocks that may occur.
"It's not good for the country," says Anthony Scilipoti, president of Veritas Investment Research, an equity analysis firm in Toronto that closely follows the housing market. He worries Canada's economy has come to depend too much on the unpredictable residential sector, leaving it vulnerable to any weakness in that area.
Residential investment has swelled to make up more than 9 per cent of economic output, the highest level on record, he notes.
Meanwhile, home prices are rising far faster than fundamental factors, such as incomes or rents.
The result is that young Canadians who lever themselves into home ownership now have far less to spend on other things, from buying new cars to saving for retirement to starting a family.
Yet despite the social and financial strains, Mr. Scilipoti doesn't see an imminent end to Canada's housing addiction.
By Veritas's reckoning, Canadian households accumulated more than $148-billion in savings since the final quarter of 2019, or about $9,400 per household, largely because of lower consumption during the pandemic. A good part of those savings have flowed into real estate and there is no obvious reason why the money gusher should suddenly stop.
"The problem is that all the usual fundamental ratios - home prices-to-rent, home prices-to-income, and so on - just show the market is stretched," Mr. Scilipoti says. "For a correction to occur, you need a catalyst."
What could that catalyst be?
The most obvious threat, says Mr. Brown of Capital Economics, would be a sudden rise in interest rates.
"At their current levels, home prices are vulnerable to any unexpected hikes," he says.
He, too, worries about the risks that are building up.
But the Bank of Canada knows better than anyone how sensitive home prices are to interest rates, he says.
He expects the central bank to proceed cautiously in tightening policy.
Others argue the housing market's first big test will come when the economy begins to reopen.
What happens next for home prices will hinge on several factors, including interest rates, how quickly immigration bounces back and how rapidly the economy recovers from the pandemic lockdowns.
The problem, Prof. Moffatt notes, is that big recent gains mean even double-digit home price correction would simply reverse the advance of the past few months, punishing recent buyers but not making homes that much more affordable.
"I'm not predicting a crash, but I could see a scenario where we get the worst of both worlds," Prof. Moffatt says.
"You can imagine a fall in prices that would be enormous by historical standards and reverse much of the gains of recent months, but that would still leave home prices really high."

Full text: One of the most successful startups to launch in Canada in the past decade, travel accommodations provider Sonder Holdings Inc., laid out aggressive growth plans Friday as it announced it will go public on Nasdaq.
Sonder, which was founded by Canadian Francis Davidson during his freshman year at Montreal's McGill University in 2012 and moved to San Francisco in 2016, said it will merge with Gores Metropoulos II, Inc. The deal gives it US$650million of cash held by the special purpose acquisition company, an enterprise value of US$2.2-billion and equity valued at US$2.9-billion.
Existing Sonder investors, including Canada's Inovia Capital Growth Fund I, will retain 74-per-cent ownership. The deal, which has yet to be approved by GM II shareholders, is expected to close in the second half of this year. It has been unanimously approved by boards of Sonder and GM II.
"I've wanted to build an iconic 21st-century brand ... and this is a necessary pit stop along that journey," the 28-year-old chief executive said in an interview.
"While the industry is on its back, we opted to charge forward," by going public.
Sonder has emerged as both a partner and rival to giant Airbnb, Inc., which went public in December. Rather than provide a platform for homeowners to rent properties to travellers as Airbnb does, Sonder leases spaces from real estate companies, giving it more control over rooms and furnishings. It targeted digitally savvy millennials seeking "authentic" experiences instead of generic hotels or the uneven quality of Airbnb rentals, though it does list on Airbnb.
Forgoing costly amenities such as room service, front desks and gyms, Sonder provides keyless entry to rooms appointed as in hip boutique hotels, scattered in buildings in cosmopolitan neighbourhoods in 35 cities in eight countries. Sonder offers digital concierge services to guests through their phones, connecting them to local services such as food delivery. Operating costs are 50 per cent lower than traditional hotels.
Mr. Davidson, who originally started out by renting his Montreal apartment to travellers between school years, left Canada to build Sonder because he lacked experience. "The most important thing for me was to surround myself with people who had done it before, that had taken a company public, built a global brand rapidly and had raised hundreds of millions of dollars," he said.
Sonder figured out its unit economics by 2018, stepped up expansion efforts and attracted rivals. Then the pandemic hit. It slashed costs, cut rates by 45 per cent and marketed its properties as temporary shelters for health care workers, displaced students and stranded travellers. That helped it reach nearly 50-per-cent occupancy, better than accommodation providers.
Its three biggest startup rivals, Stay Alfred and Airbnb-based Lyric Hospitality and Oyo Homes and Hospitality left the business. Meanwhile, Sonder raised US$170-million in venture capital last spring. The company saw revenue in 2020 dip to US$116-million from $143-million in 2019, a better performance than the accommodations industry as a whole, while daily revenue per available room fell to US$81 from US$143.
"Because of their resilience and grit and fast action, they were able to not only weather the pandemic but position themselves to come out of the crisis as a leading entity" as travel rebounds, said Inovia general partner Chris Arsenault.
Now, after ending 2020 with 12,000 rooms under contract - 1,000 fewer than a year earlier - and 5,000 of them in use, Sonder is betting heavily on a solid and sustained rebound for the travel business after the pandemic.
"We decided this was potentially one of the best moments in the history of hospitality to really lean in and deploy our revolutionizing model," Mr. Davidson said.
Sonder plans to expand briskly, reaching 77,000 units "live" by the end of 2025 and 25,000 more under contract for future use. It is also forecasting revenue to reach US$4-billion in 2025, up from a projected US$173-million this year, and for daily revenue per room to fully recover and surpass prepandemic levels by 2023.
The company will initially focus on adding rooms in existing markets such as London, New York and Mexico City; it plans to expand to Asia, add resort rentals and franchise its software to other operators.
Meanwhile, Sonder is signing up landlords to cover 90 per cent of capital expenditures and has entered into revenue-sharing agreements with many. Its deals with landlords eager to fill buildings at favourable rates means Sonder's payback period on rooms is three months. Sonder projects adjusted operating earnings will rise from a US$200-million loss in 2020 to a US$822million gain in 2025.

Full text: Tim Richardson last August traded traffic gridlock and a grinding commute from Oshawa, Ont., for a wetsuit, a home near the ocean and an office on the Halifax waterfront with a sweeping view of the harbour.
Meanwhile, Julie Gardner and her Oakville, Ont., family are excited to move this month to their new home: a leafy, suburban property with a big yard, mature trees - and a cozy, three-bedroom bungalow in Lower Sackville, N.S.
that they've never actually set foot inside.
Both swapped the Greater Toronto Area for Atlantic Canada during the pandemic, joining a wave of Canadians moving east.
Many buy homes sight-unseen as the influx drives up prices. But they're also bringing economic activity - in Mr. Richardson's case, his Ontario-based firm Jonas Software is in the middle of a hiring spree that could bring 100 new employees to Nova Scotia.
"I know I'm part of the problem," joked Mr. Richardson, Jonas' chief operating officer who transferred to help open its new Halifax office. "But at least I brought 30 jobs with me."
Tired of renting and facing increasingly out of reach housing prices in the GTA, Ms. Gardner found a Nova Scotia realtor this spring. She and her partner Chris Slade bought a 1,600-square-foot home in a suburb of Halifax, listed for $255,000. They went $70,000 above asking, and won the bidding war in a community where the average list price of a detached house is still under $300,000. Ms. Gardiner's mortgage will cost less than she pays to rent in Oakville.
The whole transaction was done virtually, with their realtor "walking" them through the house during a video call on her cell phone. "My husband said, this is crazy, we can't buy a home we've never been inside," said Ms. Gardner, who moves in May 17.
"But the East Coast is like the last frontier for home ownership."
In Nova Scotia, from Halifax to the Annapolis Valley to Cape Breton, house sales hit another alltime high in March, up almost 66 per cent from the previous year.
The average price of homes sold that month was up almost 27 per cent from the previous year. New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador are all reporting similar record spikes in home sales, according to national data from the Canadian Real Estate Association. In Nova Scotia, where housing prices have been historically higher than neighbouring provinces, there were 1,577 units sold in March - more than anywhere else in Atlantic Canada.
In Halifax, where record population increases have made it the second-fastest growing city in Canada, these well-educated, often young, mobile newcomers are bringing affluence and intellectual capital with them. Combined with a growing influx of international immigrants, transplanted Canadians motivated to move east during the pandemic are changing the region's demographics.
"It's gone bananas," said Maggie MacGillivray of Golden Realty Group, a Bedford-based firm.
"And it's not just COVID, this started well before that. It used to be that new immigrants would settle in Toronto first before coming here. Now they're coming directly."
She says around 40 per cent of her clients are now buyers from Ontario, and they include doctors, business professionals and tech-sector-types who can afford to pay significantly more for homes than locals because they're cashing in their properties in some of Canada's most populous areas.
These out-of-province buyers are dramatically changing the real estate market, said Donna Malone, president of the Nova Scotia Association of Realtors. They're routinely offering $100,000 above-asking, waiving conditions and outbidding others as part of an aggressive buying style that's new to the province. Many of them are "ex-pat" Maritimers returning home, but many others are like Ms. Gardner, people with no previous connection to the region.
"This is unprecedented. As fast as houses are being listed, they're selling. We've never seen this in Nova Scotia before," Ms. Malone said. "One thing we've learned from this pandemic is we have the technology to free ourselves from office spaces."
The province trying to capitalize on the phenomenon. It's using a national ad campaign with the tagline, "If you can do your job from anywhere, do it from here," as part of what the province sees as a once in a generation chance to draw a younger, wealthier workforce to the east coast.
"Not since the age of sail have we been this poised for growth. I believe we're entering a new era of prosperity for Nova Scotia," said Scott Brison, the former MP and cabinet minister who is leading the province's new Economic Growth Council, an advisory body trying to help attract more tech startups and entrepreneurs to Nova Scotia.
Mr. Brison argues the pandemic is eroding the historical economic advantage of big urban centres.
"During COVID, we're seeing Nova Scotia being viewed as a bit of a magnet for talented people who want to live in a place that combines a high quality of life with opportunities," he said.
Nova Scotia hopes to become Canada's "startup capital" built around the talent pool in its universities and research strengths such as clean tech and ocean sciences, Mr. Brison said. He acknowledged it's a "slightly audacious" goal to try to build a Silicon Valley of the east, but believes it can be done by introducing regulatory, tax, innovation and immigration policies that will encourage more growth.
Mr. Richardson said his software company considered a number of Canadian cities before it opened an office in the Nova Scotian capital. About half of its 30 Halifax employees were recruited from outside the province. They're drawn to work in a place where they can afford a sizable house instead of a condo, and have more enjoyable lifestyle, he said.
"Halifax checked all the boxes," said Mr. Richardson, who added that local economic development organizations introduced him to people running invaluable grant programs and internships.
More and more working-age Canadians are moving into Nova Scotia, instead of leaving - a positive trend that began in 2015 after years of departures. Between July, 2019, and July, 2020, it had a net gain of 2,705 people between the ages of 18 and 64 from other provinces - an indicator economists suggest means the prepandemic growth is expected to continue after COVID-19 is under control.
Ms. Gardner, a first aid and defibrillator instructor who lost her job at the start of the pandemic, said she was growing tired of the traffic and unaffordable lifestyle of Southern Ontario and wanted a "new direction." She fell in love with Nova Scotia in 2019, when she helped run a bed and breakfast for a summer, and started thinking about more permanent move.
"It was honestly one of the happiest times in my life," she said.
Because Nova Scotia requires most visitors to self-isolate for two weeks upon arrival, Ms. Gardner and her husband chose to shop for homes virtually. They bid on three other listings before they were finally successful.
"These type of sight-unseen sales are becoming increasingly common," said Anna Huschman, the couple's realtor, who said she's getting calls from out-ofprovince buyers every day. "We have people coming from all across Canada, and even further away. People want to be here, and they're willing to do whatever they have to do to be here."
The average price of homes sold across all of Nova Scotia in March was a record $362,988, up almost 27 per cent from the previous year. That's still significantly less than the average price of a home sold in Ontario ($890,035) or British Columbia ($945,936).
This may be great news for sellers, but it also inspires concern. Kelvin Ndoro, a Halifaxbased analyst with the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation, warns that the city's housing market is becoming overheated, part of a trend that began with five straight years of net interprovincial migration gains and increasing international immigration, and now amplified by COVID-19.
"The pandemic has only increased the interest in our housing market, and some of those pressures," Mr. Ndoro said. "And those impacts have not been evenly spread across all income groups. Those employed in lower-income industries have been less able to adapt to the pandemic, and this ultimately affects first-time home buyers the most."

Full text: It may be too soon to expect real estate listings to stream onto the Canadian market this spring as warm weather wafts in.
Fighting the pandemic is still the top priority for many people across the country. In Toronto and surrounding cities, some homeowners are hesitant to list their properties for sale.
Elise Kalles, broker at Harvey Kalles Real Estate Ltd., says new listings are arriving, but they are still tight in every segment at her firm.
Ms. Kalles, who concentrates in the luxury market, says the top tier in Toronto is made up almost exclusively of local buyers who want to improve their surroundings while they spend most of their time at home.
"My big sales this year were people in Toronto upgrading," she says.
In the price range above $7.5million, 43 houses traded hands in 2020 compared with 23 houses in that segment in 2019.
Ms. Kalles has sold properties in the past year at prices between $7.5-million and $20-million or more in such areas as Forest Hill, the Bridle Path, Casa Loma and Yorkville.
This spring, the buyers are still seeking those havens, but competition is intense. Empty nesters who were planning to move into condos have delayed those decisions so that they can have family visits outdoors, she says.
"They say, ‘Our children come on weekends. They can use the pool and the gardens and we can entertain outside.' " Throughout the pandemic, Ms. Kalles has seen an increase in offmarket transactions. Some homeowners may be interested in selling, but they prefer to do so without a sign on the lawn or a large number of visitors.
Throughout the past year, some homeowners have been reluctant to have their homes appear on the public Multiple Listing Service, she says, so she quietly posts those to a Facebook group that agents have formed to share information about the homes that are listed on an exclusive basis.
"If I get a new listing, I put it on the site and all the agents who work in the price range see it," she says. "And agents call each other - I'm going to be listing this; I know you were looking for that."
In the lower price ranges, the bidding wars that are so commonplace in Toronto this spring are extremely stressful for agents, she says.
"Believe me, none of us like it when we have 14 or 15 offers."
Representing buyers can be very challenging when competition is strong, says Ms. Kalles, who now helps the children and grandchildren of her long-time clients to buy their first homes.
Many people are asking her if she believes the market is too frothy. In her opinion, the current low supply has put upward pressure on prices, but the Toronto market is not in a bubble.
She believes it will remain strong throughout the coming year - especially when immigration picks up again.
Still, she doesn't like to see buyers carried away by emotion.
"You have to come to a point, if you're a responsible agent, when you say, ‘Stop bidding. You're already overpaying - don't get carried away.' " Ms. Kalles says she reminds young buyers of the changes they may have to make to their lifestyles in the future.
"What if interest rates go up?
And they can. What do you do then?" Interest rates have been so low for so long that some people - especially younger generations who have never seen lofty mortgage rates - have trouble believing they will ever climb, or how perilous a buyer's financial circumstances can become if they do.
"They have to believe it," she says of the facts she delivers. "The market goes in cycles."
The slight uptick in interest rates the Canadian market has seen recently has not been enough to slow momentum this spring, says Rishi Sondhi, economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank, who says the country's housing is still deeply entrenched in sellers' territory.
In March, new listings rose 7.5 per cent from February, according to the Canadian Real Estate Association, while sales increased 5.2 per cent in the same period.
At the same time, however, months of inventory dipped to 1.7 months - the lowest on record, Mr. Sondhi says.
Meanwhile, the average price rose 4.4 per cent in March from the previous month. Compared with March, 2020, the average price jumped 31.6 per cent to stand at $716,828.
Mr. Sondhi predicts that prices will continue to rise in the near term because of the low inventory and high demand.
April and May are shaping up to be interesting months in the Canadian housing market, he adds.
On the one hand, the prospect of a stricter stress test on uninsured mortgages - which could be in place for June 1 - could pull forward some sales as buyers rush to get in before the deadline. That trend would keep prices buoyant.
On the other hand, the economist cautions, the third wave of the pandemic could weigh on activity.
Looking farther out, Mr. Sondhi believe current sales levels are unsustainable.
"We anticipate some cooling in sales starting in the second half of the year as rising interest rates begin to bite. This should also sap some steam from price growth."
CREA's senior economist, Shaun Cathcart, points out that the rebound in listings this spring could be a sign that pent-up supply is finally being released.
During the past year, people who did not have a home in which to ride out the pandemic really wanted one, while so many of those who did have a home to hunker down in were not inclined to give it up.
"It stands to reason then that as the uncertainty caused and danger posed by COVID wind down, some owners who would not sell during a global pandemic will emerge with properties for sale, while at the same time, some of the urgency on the demand side could dissipate."

Full text: Although it's one of the smaller photographs accompanying the July, 1915, Construction magazine article, it speaks much louder than those showcasing luxurious banking interiors, sculpted friezes, or Corinthian columns marching along Yonge and King Streets. About six men, wearing suits and moustaches - and no doubt clutching cigars or brandy snifters - cluster and converse behind the thin railing on the 20thstorey observation deck of the new Royal Bank building.
While it's difficult to read expressions, likely all faces sport some combination of pride, accomplishment, or gravitas. After all, this building had just been crowned tallest in the Commonwealth and, as such, became another indicator of the shift from Montreal to Toronto as Canada's financial centre. And if one of those men was Montreal-born architect George Allen Ross or his Melbourne, Australia-born partner, Robert Henry Macdonald, he was no doubt feeling chuffed as he looked down at the other new buildings he had bested - especially the formerly tallest-in-theempire Canadian Pacific Railway building, with its copper-clad rooftop cupolas - along the city's "Edwardian skyscraper row."
"By 1915," writes architect David E. Winterton in a 2015 issue of the Journal of the Society for the Study of Architecture in Canada, "the north shore of Lake Ontario had a new metropolitan skyline, an architecturally hybrid vertical expression of Toronto's New World prosperity ... fairly - and fittingly - described as a half-Edwardian and half-Beaux-Arts concoction."
Heady stuff.
But, around the same time Mr. Winterton was researching his very good article, his colleagues at ERA Architects were taking stock of what a hundred years of pollution, road salt, freeze-thaw cycles, insensitive renovations and other assorted abuses had done to this former crown jewel.
Even at the very top things didn't look good, says ERA project manager Noah McGillivray: "Instead of repairing [the roof] through the century, they just reclad over it, trapping moisture; it was rotting, the whole roof, so we did have to take the whole thing apart ... profile all the details, match them exactly, and then recreate them in copper."
On an unseasonably cold day in late April, Mr. McGillivray, his ERA associate Daniel Lewis, and building science and restoration specialist Duncan Rowe of RJC Engineers inspect these new rooftop details - without brandy snifters in hand - and reminisce about the journey, which saw scaffolding up in 2014 for some plinth repair, then, after a change of ownership to Kingsett Capital, envelope the entire building in 2019.
"A big part of the story of the project, really, is that this building faded into the background for a long time. ... I think its original character was totally lost," Mr. McGillivray says.
Something else that might have been lost was the acanthus leaf ornamentation from the columns. Chunks of the plaster, mortar and terracotta block had fallen to the street in years past, prompting the city to order the property owner to wrap them in chicken wire. The terracotta block, incredibly, had been fastened to the building's steel frame by wrapping wire around it and then slapping mortar over top.
This ad-hoc approach, Mr. McGillivray explains, happened for only a short while during the "overlap" between traditional masonry construction and modern steel buildings.
"They were working it out as they went," he says, "having one foot in the 20th century and the other in the 19th century with Beaux-Arts detailing."
Of course, as much of the original terracotta and acanthus ornamentation that could be saved was, and then remounted, in situ, with new high-strength brackets.
But in cases where deterioration was too great, ERA and RJC found a local shop to make a mould - complete with the vertical tooling marks found on the originals - for the 337 reproductions that were needed. For some of this work, the two firms consulted with Chicago-based engineer Amy Lamb Woods, an expert in terracotta, brick, stone, terrazzo and stucco.
Another massive undertaking was replacement of the windows.
Badly tarnished, sealed shut with screws, painted over on the inside and, most importantly, completely inefficient, once the city's heritage folk were convinced with a mock-up, more than 300 new units were fabricated by Roof Tile Management, with brass beauties for the south and west façades, and steel for the non-decorative façades.
"The three of us went to the shop to see how they did it, how they rolled all the brass," says Mr. Lewis, his English accent getting stronger as his excitement rises.
"It's traditional methods, little hammers; it was like Santa's workshop," Mr. McGillivray says with a laugh.
On the 16th, 17th, and 18th storeys, what were "piles of rusty metal" around each window-set have now been restored to "mini temples" with pediments and pilasters painted a period-appropriate oxblood red. Soft lead flashing now protects sills and lugs like a "suit of armour."
"It's amazing how much work they put into these parts of the building that are kind of difficult for the naked eye to see," Mr. McGillivray says. "They just suspended all of these sculptures - " Mr. Lewis interrupts: "The cornice is crazy, too, the projection and the decorative elements."
And speaking of the cornice (which, thankfully, hadn't been removed in what Mr. Winterton describes in his JSSAC article as "Toronto's ‘cornice annihilation' period of the 1970s"), it needed complete restoration as well, including the replacement of dentils that had been hacked away for cables; those with eagle eyes can spot the shiny new ones.
Once the last bits of scaffolding around the Corinthian columns come down - which will be relatively soon and with acanthus leaves restored and chicken wire gone - one won't need avian vision to appreciate the work that's gone into 8 King East. The building literally glows.
"With the shiny windows and the creamy terracotta, it does look like opening day in 1915," Mr. McGillivray says.
"It looks crackin' from the street," Mr. Lewis says.
When workers return after COVID-19 is done, Mr. Rowe says, they'll surely do a double take: "What is this building? I've never seen it before!"

Full text: DONE DEAL 3193 W. 28th Ave., Vancouver DUNBAR-SOUTHLANDS Asking price: $2.598-million Selling price: $3.1-million Previous selling price: $105,000 (1979); $89,000 (1975) Days on market: 7 Taxes: $8,208 (2021) Listing agent: Cheryl Steer, Macdonald Realty THE ACTION Listing agent Cheryl Steer says the current market is driven by local demand. "We chose the price to get attention, for sure. I was almost 100per-cent sure it was going to go over, but we didn't know how much. It was more than the sellers had expected, so they were over-the-moon excited. It's an extremely strong seller's market."
Ms. Steer says the house had 38 showings and received 11 offers, most of them subject-free. Some of those who made offers had preoffer inspections done on the house. The deal completes May 13.
WHAT THEY GOT The four-bedroom, three-bathroom bungalow has 2,677 square feet of living space, sits on a large corner lot on the west side and was built in 1972.
The living room has beech hardwood floors and a wood-burning fireplace, while the sunroom has vaulted ceilings and skylights. The house had been updated, including windows, metal roof and sundeck.
There is a recreation room with fireplace, bedroom and laundry downstairs. The house is within walking distance of parks, transit and shops.
THE AGENT'S TAKE "It's just so refreshing to go into a house where somebody has paid attention to all the things that needed to be done," Ms. Steer said.
"There are so many houses that get neglected that it's sad."

Full text: 12 Hayhoe Rd., Seguin, Ont.
PARRY SOUND Asking price: $1,499,000 (March, 2021) Selling price: $1,440,000 (March, 2021) Taxes: $2,120 (2021) Days on the market: Seven Listing agent: Gary Phillips, Engel & Volkers Parry Sound THE ACTION This updated, four-season cottage rests on a 5.66-acre site with 390 feet along Silver Lake just two hours north of Toronto. The house has a drilled well, septic system and access from a seasonally maintained, private road. There were nine visitors interested enough to take an in-person tour, one of whom presented a condition-free bid before the date set for a review date of offers "We have a pent-up demand for waterfront properties," local agent Gary Phillips said.
"The days on market, year over year, have dropped from 35 to 10, and the only reason it's at 10 is because there hasn't been a cottage listed in the last six months without holding [back] offers."
"Rather than wait to see what came in on offer day, these sellers chose to work with the pre-emptive offer."
WHAT THEY GOT This 11/2-storey cottage was recently gutted and enlarged to provide 1,550 square feet of living space with new mechanics and a dining room addition with vaulted wood ceiling.
Balconies are located off one of three bedrooms and a combined family room and kitchen.
Directly below, a recreation room has a walkout to the grounds and a sandy beach with a new dock and boathouse.
THE AGENT'S TAKE "It's a large plot of land with a great deal of water frontage, and it had been professionally renovated from top to bottom," Mr. Phillips said.
"Trees on the property were beautiful - large, hard maple trees - so it was very pretty all year. Fall would be spectacular."
The lake also has prized qualities. "It's a quieter lake, so you don't get much boat traffic, and it is considered a cold-water lake, so it can sustain more rare species of fish," Mr. Phillips said.
"If this was on Lake Joseph, which is literally two miles down the road, it would have been three times the price, so the lake size matters."

Full text: With a temperate ocean climate, gardens and heritage architecture, Victoria is often considered one of the most appealing cities in Canada. But it is also one of the most expensive places for businesses to lease workspace.
Victoria's 0.7-per-cent vacancy rate for industrial space is the lowest in North America, and its lease rates are the highest in Canada, according to the latest data from CBRE, a leading commercial real estate services firm.
Entrepreneurs who do manage to find scarce industrial space will pay rent that has risen 15 per cent in the past year to $16.50 a square foot - higher than Vancouver's average, at $14.55 a square foot, or Toronto's, at $10.25 a square foot.
With a steadily growing population on an island constrained by water and mountains, and with technology continuing to disrupt traditional ideas about the role and location of industrial space, CBRE predicts Victoria will maintain its title as Canada's strongest industrial real estate market for the foreseeable future.
Giant developers getting in on the game for the first time include Vancouver-based Beedie and PC Urban Properties Corp., under its IntraUrban brand. The companies have snapped up two rare industrial-designated lots, with construction to begin next year.
The companies bring with them a new type of industrial development for the city, one that has started to prove successful in the tight, expensive Vancouver market: strata industrial builds, or industrial condos - large, industrial park developments where the units are sold, not leased, and buyers pay monthly strata fees for maintenance and communal amenities.
"Victoria is just starved for industrial space," says Brent Sawchyn, chief executive officer of PC Urban. "There hasn't really been anything like what we are offering in the area and we thought it would be a good opportunity."
PC Urban's project includes a trio of industrial strata-unit buildings on a five-acre lot, located in the Greater Victoria municipality of Colwood.
Victoria's high and rising land value makes it easier to justify developing and selling, Mr. Sawchyn says. The average sale price for industrial land has reached $300 a square foot - the second highest rate in Canada, behind Vancouver's average, at $390, and ahead of Toronto's, at $258, CBRE says.
In Canada, the industrial strata concept has primarily been a Vancouver phenomenon. But now in Victoria, business owners are also seeking shelter from the relentless trajectory of leases by favouring strata.
"The cost of servicing a mortgage is probably less than the prevailing lease rate," Mr. Sawchyn says. "And there's the comfort of businesses controlling their own destiny, while building equity.
With a lease, you're always at the vagaries of the landlord. And I think, right now, many business owners are having this eye-opening experience: ‘There's not enough land available; if I don't get something now, I may never get another opportunity.' "PC Urban's IntraUrban Colwood development will feature 30 light-industrial units and six office units, with sizes ranging from 1,500 square feet and up. It's the company's 10th strata industrial project in British Columbia, all of which have been swift to sell. The Colwood brochure hypes attributes that are key to the PC Urban brand: prime location and an emphasis on architectural design. "Almost too good to be industrial," it says.
Beedie, Western Canada's largest private land owner and developer, was a pioneer of the industrial strata concept, completing a park in Vancouver 13 years ago. Beedie currently has six industrial strata projects on the go in Metro Vancouver, and three to introduce to Toronto.
In Greater Victoria, Beedie's first industrial development takes over 13 acres, in the municipality of Langford, B.C.'s fastest growing city.
"We really liked the market fundamentals," says Beth Berry, Beedie's vice-president of industrial development. "The units will be designed specifically to suit the types of requirements that we were seeing on the island."
Strata units have the flexibility to be manufacturing centres, showrooms, warehouses and loft office space. They can accommodate Victoria's technology sector (the seventh largest in Canada); rapidly expanding, same-day e-commerce operations; evolving needs of food services; and scores of other forms of light industry.
The strata units will feature "high ceilings to accommodate a mezzanine for office space, welldesigned lighting for that office and increased power supply to run automation systems and large equipment, such as electric forklifts," says Rowan Hicks, Beedie's director of industrial sales.
For now, buyer interest in Victoria's nascent strata industrial scene is mostly from owneroccupiers, says Cory Wright, president of Vancouver-based William Wright Commercial, which recently expanded into Victoria.
But some investors are circling in on the action. That early Beedie project, in Metro Vancouver, initially sold for about $175 a square foot. In Victoria, a small, 13-unit strata industrial project, by a local developer, has sold out, Mr. Wright says. "Seven buyers were investors," he says, with buyers paying between $325 and $350 a square foot.
"Because the vacancy rates are so low, we're starting to see investors come into the marketplace," Mr. Wright says. "The returns make a lot of sense. As the pricing of these assets get higher and higher, we could run into a position where some of the smaller, potential owner-occupier buyers unfortunately get priced out."

Smaller boards want Toronto giant to share

Full text: A group of 22 Ontario real estate boards have banded together to make a pitch to the country's largest real estate board to share its rich trove of data in a bid to break down digital barriers in the industry.
On April 8, Michelle Wobst, president of Information Technology Systems Ontario, and Donna Bacher, president of the Realtors Association of HamiltonBurlington, sent a letter to the directors of the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board calling the current status quo "unacceptable" and that it was time for real estate boards everywhere to break out of their "silos" and begin to share the most precious asset of any real estate board: the home sale listing data managed by their internal multiple listing systems (MLS).
"We want to be able to provide realtors with access to all the MLS listing content they need regardless of whether they join an ITSO Member Association, RAHB, or TRREB," the letter reads. "Realtors need 100 per cent of the MLS listing content to conduct accurate valuations, to ensure their clients don't miss out on opportunities."
For decades, Ontario real estate has been carved up into dozens of geographic fiefdoms run by local boards with a mixed record of collaboration. Once, all the new listings in a region were collected in a physically printed book, but as digitization arrived each board began to run a database where realtors could access and analyze listings for their own region. Over time, some boards began to share those databases with each other in regional data-sharing agreements, but it was still fragmented across the province.
There are 37 separate real estate boards in Ontario, and by 2020 there were three main coalitions of boards sharing listing data among themselves: Ontario Regional Technology & Information Systems Inc. (ORTIS, founded in 2015, which centred on the Tri-Cities area of Guelph, Kitchener and Cambridge), TRREB (which includes Toronto, Durham, Brampton and Northumberland Hills boards) and Ontario Collective (which covered most of cottage country, Peterborough and Prince Edward County). ITSO was formed by a merger of ORTIS and OC in August, 2020, and now has 21 boards with 14,000 members under one listing sharing MLS.
ITSO now covers most of the geography in the province having done data-sharing deals with Hamilton and Ottawa-area boards, leaving only the three Windsorarea boards, three in Northern Ontario and TRREB out of its database.
"I think we've just grown naturally to this point, we haven't gone after somebody and said you need to be part of us," Ms. Wobst said of ITSO's growth. "It's not that we want world domination, the focus is about providing best data possible, through the best technology we feel is out there. We're at the point now where we see there's this missing data and we want to rectify the situation." The missing data are listings posted by one real estate board in another's territory; if the systems don't talk, the local board members won't see a new listing unless they subscribe to a data-sharing service or the listing agent pays a separate fee to "interboard" post the listing. Ontario realtors can help buy or sell a home anywhere in the province, but they would put the listing on the system run by the board they are a member of. The 800-pound gorilla of missing data for ITSO is TRREB, with its more than 60,000 members.
"When you hear TRREB say they've got 65,000 members, those are forced memberships.
Right now the agents trading in Hamilton have been forced to take out memberships in Toronto. You're talking a lot of money" in order to see TRREB listings in the Hamilton board zone, Ms. Bacher said. The current annual TRREB membership fee is about $860. RAHB is the second-largest board in the province and is not a member of ITSO, but does have a two-way data-sharing agreement.
"That pendulum swings both ways. We have members in many other boards; if they want to be dual, that's a good thing," said John DiMichele, CEO of TRREB.
He estimates about 20 per cent of transactions in TRREB's areas were listed by agents from outside its boundaries, a figure that's similar to what some other board presidents in the ITSO coalition estimate TRREB agents list in their boundaries.
ITSO and TRREB do have an agreement in which members from both groups can subscribe to a special feed of all listing data, but it's a separate fee, separate log-in and doesn't provide built-in data analytics available in some MLS systems.
"TRREB really is a massive organization. We've always had a really good relationship with them but it's really hard to move such a big ship," said Nicole Pohl, president of Kitchener-Waterloo Association of Realtors. But the missing data issue has only grown more acute during the past 14 months of the pandemic. "There's a lot of migration out of those large urban centres coming into areas where prepandemic [TRREB agents] weren't traditionally trading in. We need to come up with some way for all Ontario realtors have access to data."
Mr. DiMichele said that TRREB has had informal talks on the subject, and points out that a TRREB service called Connect existed for about 10 years to provide data sharing, but was retired after, among other issues, some regional boards abandoned the project.
TRREB's major concerns with a data-sharing agreements relate to issues with log-in security, and potential vulnerability to datascraping by real estate entrepreneurs looking to leverage TRREB member listings on competitive websites.
"We're basically down to two systems: ITSO and TRREB.
They've both invested substantial resources and neither one is going to disappear overnight," said Nelson Goulart, director of communications and president-elect of the Mississauga Real Estate Board, which joined ITSO despite having a large proportion of its members dual-board with TRREB.
"Are we going to data share?
The reality is we can visualize how that will look, but there has to be a strong push by membership if that's the direction they want to go."

Full text: Toronto intersections, especially major ones, have personalities.
Think about it: King and Bay is confident, yet slightly aloof; Yonge and Dundas is glib, scattered and show-bizzy; suburban Kennedy and Lawrence is a smooth-talking salesperson wearing off-the-rack clothing; and Yonge and Eglinton - at least how I remember it - is a young, single professional that reeks, slightly, of ale and onion rings.
And then there's Yonge and St. Clair, an intersection where I spent 17 years of my life - when not writing my Globe column - working at CFRB radio (my other profession is radio producer). As much as I loved that chunk of midtown, it was, in a word, sleepy. In fact, the engineers at the station christened the hardware store down the street "Old Lady Hardware" since when they'd visit for solder or electrical tape, the only other customers inside were elderly widows purchasing birdseed or light bulbs.
But things have changed a great deal since I left in 2014.
In 2016, Slate Asset Management added three more buildings to their Yonge/ St.Clair portfolio, which brought the total to eight - including each of the four buildings on each corner of the intersection - and began revitalization in earnest.
The next year they announced they'd partnered with Chicago's award-winning Studio Gang, led by Jeanne Gang, to build a tower that would not be a "typical allglass" affair.
And when Ms. Gang unveiled One Delisle, a tapering, artichoke-like, 47-storey tower with wide balconies and a sensitive treatment of the pedestrian realm for Yonge Street and Delisle Avenue - which includes retention of a non-designated 1928 heritage façade - Toronto took notice.
Since shovels will be in the ground soon, I caught up with Ms. Gang over Zoom.
DAVE LEBLANC: Even before you received the commission, did Toronto appear on your radar?
JEANNE GANG: Yeah, the two cities, Chicago and Toronto, are pretty close together, like siblings, I guess. When I first visited it, though, my first impression was that it maybe feels a little more international than Chicago, not just because it's not U.S., it felt slightly more European. I love the parts of downtown that are really pedestrian-friendly and interesting ... but the difference is the landscape most of all, the beautiful ravines and the topography that we just don't have [since] Chicago is very flat.
DL: And what about Yonge and St. Clair specifically?
JG: The dimension of the blocks, there's something about it, it doesn't feel activated to its maximum potential, and that's one reason why we're focusing on giving a little bit more space on the one side for pedestrians and, on the other, activating the park side [there was a house-turned-office on Delisle that will be removed to link the project to an existing parkette]. We got to conceive of it as a complete block with every side activated, and that's going to really improve the walkability of the neighbourhood.
DL: Did Slate ask for a bold design?
JG: I think they were attracted to our work because of the way that it embraces the tower as a place for social interaction as opposed to isolation; I know the conversation going on in Toronto about balconies and how they are wasted space or not good for the environment. ... I never bought into that, they're really important for people ... [to] have more connection to the environment, to neighbours. I really like seeing the life on the building, when people put their own stuff out on the balcony, that makes it look, to me, more engaging.
[Ms. Gang goes on to explain how One Delisle's balconies will be sheltered for use during shoulder months, and how inspiration came from a type of beach chair with a high back that allows users to face the sun but avoid wind].
DL: The shape - artichoke or pine cone?
JG: Well, I'm a huge fan of the patterns you can find in nature and there's always a logic to it. Both an artichoke and a pine cone - and a sunflower for that matter - there's a spiralling organization of the seeds, the petals ... it's nature solving a packing problem.
Ms. Gang has spoken publicly on how even very tall towers can encourage friendly communities beyond elevator small talk.
At Studio Gang's 82-storey Aqua in Chicago, for example, rippling balconies create sightlines that allow folks to chat with neighbours above and below. At One Delisle, large balconies and smaller ones will create a similar effect, as will the expansive "Ravine Terrace."
JG: Those are the types of things that can encourage more social space within the tower itself. Some of them are organized in these stems, and then on top of each one there's a more open balcony, so there's a variety [and] people can choose what kind of outdoor space they like ... two neighbours can see each other, but not uncomfortably so, like peeking into their living room.
In the U.S., Studio Gang does a lot of "urban activation" work, Ms. Gang says, which helps struggling, vacant, or violent (or all three) neighbourhoods by helping them identify and develop existing assets to in order to thrive.
DL: Would you be interested in doing urban activation work in Toronto?
JG: I would love to; it's a city that is really exciting, and I like how [the] urban planning [department] is very engaged in thinking about the different parts of the city.
While I'll always want the lion's share of work to go to local firms, I do enjoy it when outsiders are invited to rethink parts of our city, whether it's One Delisle, at Yonge and Bloor for Sir Norman Foster's "The One," or on King Street West with Bjarke Ingels Group's "King Toronto" project.
With these, the city's personality can only get more interesting, international, and complex.

A lakeside retreat for long-time boaters

Full text: For 15 years, architect John O'Connor and his partner, Rick Hayward, spent their summer weekends yachting.
They often set out from a marina in Midland, Ont., an hour and 40 minutes north of their home in Toronto. They would then explore the coves and bays of Georgian Bay's 30,000 Islands - the world's largest freshwater archipelago.
The pair's boat, with three bedrooms and two bathrooms, had enough space to accommodate friends when they wanted company. Many times, the couple took trips just the two of them, meeting fellow yachters as they went or simply enjoying the opportunity to be reclusive.
On board their boat, the days were spontaneous and picture perfect They could head in any direction, drop anchor anywhere. The landscape of granite outcroppings, scruffy windswept pines and amber sunsets is the stuff of Tom Thomson paintings. "Some of those bays are incredibly secluded," Mr. O'Connor says. "There would be no one around, just pristine water, stunning scenery."
Despite the idyllic setup, four years ago the two decided they needed a change. "Owning a boat is a huge time commitment," Mr. O'Connor says. "Boats require a lot of maintenance and are very costly." Things were getting to a point where, during the summer, the couple always felt they had to spend their weekends on the water, to justify the constant effort and expense. "As in, people would invite us to a wedding, and we'd say no, sorry, we have to be on the boat," Mr. O'Connor says.
As an alternative, Mr. O'Connor and Mr. Hayward decided to build a cottage - a place they could use year-round, not just in the summer like their yacht. Removing the seasonal constraint lowered the pressure on warmweather weekends: instead of having use of their vacation home for a scant 12 to 16 weeks a year, they could come and go at their leisure.
In committing to a fixed location, the pair knew they would lose the freedom and variety of roaming Georgian Bay. But in choosing their site, they wanted a setting with the same beauty and calm they used to find cruising the 30,000 Islands.
In 2017, Mr. O'Connor and Mr. Hayward found their property: five vacant acres at the end of a lane, across from uninhabited, undeveloped Beckwith Island, and not far from their former marina in Midland. "There are only about five or seven other houses in the area," Mr. O'Connor says. None of the other properties are in view of the home that Mr. O'Connor has since designed - providing the desired sense of seclusion.
The aesthetic of the resulting cottage is modern. There is expansive glass (though there are also deep roof overhangs to reduce solar heat gain in the summer). The siding is a corrugated, matte grey metal fashioned from industrial-strength ties. "I wanted something zero maintenance," says Mr. O'Connor, adding that the ties are hidden behind vertical battens for a sleeker look.
However, there are also allusions throughout to the kind of heavy timber cabins traditionally found in Georgian Bay. The ceiling in the main-floor great room is lined with Douglas fir boards and supported by hulking pine beams (stained grey to compliment the grey tiles on the floor).
The central fireplace has built-in shelves that display smooth beach rocks, a nod to the local practice of collecting and facing chimneys using foraged stones.
The architecture was conceived to suit its site. The 2,000square-foot home sits at a highpoint, offering commanding panoramas both north to Beckwith Island across the water, and south to the dense woodlot that comprises most of the property.
Guests enter from the forest-side through a covered breezeway that frames a vista of Georgian Bay, and either leads straight down a hill to a deck and 200feet of shoreline, or into the main house. The deck is positioned a bit lower on the property, slightly disconnected from the house, so that the guard rails, though glass, in no one way clutter the views.
Throughout, the design takes details from boating. In the great room, lights dot the walls just above the floor, much lower than the typical eye-level sconces or ceiling chandeliers. On a yacht, such lighting helps passengers see where they are walking at night.
In Mr. O'Connor and Mr. Hayward's place, it has a different benefit. The fixtures are below the windows sills. "That way there is no glare from the light in the glass," Mr. O'Connor says.
"That preserves the views out."
To ensure the room isn't overly dark, there is a second set of lights, in a cove at the base of the ceiling, that shines a warm glow up to the Douglas fir boards, but again, doesn't catch in the glass of the windows.
The floor plan provides something scarcely found on a boats, even large boats: privacy for guests. On the main floor, the master bedroom and the visitor's quarters are as far away from each other as possible. They bookend the cottage, separated by a staircase, a kitchen, the dining area, a sitting space, a fireplace, the covered entry breezeway and another staircase. A weekend caller might be a heavy snorer or be rehearsing for a heavy metal act or like to tap dance at 2 a.m. - and no one would notice.
Likewise, the two guest suites in the basement are at polar ends of the layout, with the laundry, a rec room, a garage and the two sets of stairs in between. "We really wanted to be able to provide our guests what cottage weekends are all about," Mr. O'Connor says. "Peace and quiet."

Full text: In 43 years of marriage, Janet and Robert Balfour never spent more time together than they did after pandemic lockdowns descended last spring.
The husband's office shuttered and his frequent work trips halted abruptly. The couple's regular dinners with best friends vanished. Their breakfast ritual at a local diner was gone, too, including hugs from staff.
Soon, the Calgary spouses' 24/7 home life proved "too much," the husband said. An extrovert, Mr. Balfour missed the camaraderie of his colleagues.
And so, with a nudge from his wife, he returned to a lightly staffed office last fall.
"Janet very politely booted me back to work," said Mr. Balfour, a managing partner in real estate financing.
Throughout the lockdowns, he realized his wife's social networks were much wider than his own. She'd walk with her girlfriends from the gym, or run her Rotary Club through Zoom, the video-conference app.
"She has better resources than I have, which, thank God, because I've driven her crazy, I'm sure," Mr. Balfour said. "How often can you just rely on your spouse?" After a year locked down, many Canadians find their community ties weakened. The characters who used to populate everyday life - work colleagues, gym buddies, craft groups, pub friends, local business owners - have dimmed from view.
Together, they formed a community of "other significant others" - OSOs for short - the people we turn to for a multitude of social and emotional needs. Social psychology professor Eli Finkel coined the term to describe people who help us outsource, so we don't overwhelm our romantic partners.
A year into the global crisis, stressed and alienated from their OSOs, people are increasingly relying on live-in partners to fill these roles - straining their relationships with unrealistic expectations in the process.
"It's unlikely that any one person would be capable of or interested in talking about work politics, being your exercise buddy, your fellow movie buff, the person you can talk to about family drama," said Logan Ury, a behavioural scientist and director of relationship science at the dating app Hinge.
"It puts a lot of pressure on the relationship to be all of these things. When a person inevitably can't do it, we are disappointed in them, or feel the relationship has failed," said Ms. Ury, author of How to Not Die Alone: The Surprising Science That Will Help You Find Love.
Ms. Ury points to the research of Elaine Cheung, who found that people with large communities of friends for specific needs - a sister to cheer you up, a colleague to gripe with - were happier than those with fewer ties.
Such networks take the load off spouses: "We know from the research that having these other significant others is a way to invest in your own primary relationship," Ms. Ury said.
Partners "don't have to be everything to you," argued Vicki Larson, co-author of The New I Do: Reshaping Marriage for Skeptics, Realists and Rebels.
"They can be really good at the things that you fell in love with them for," Ms. Larson said. "You don't have to burden them with all the other stuff going on in your life." As pandemic restrictions eased in Ottawa six months ago, Veronica Roy began dating an acquaintance. The two have made a conscious decision not to overload each other through these hard times, living apart and maintaining contact with friends, if only online.
"We both try to be mindful of not leaning on each other for every single emotional need," said Ms. Roy, a 34-year-old performing artist and arts administrator.
Since the pandemic hit, Ms. Roy has been suffering disconnection from their arts and culture community, where colleagues served as friends and chosen family, commiserating about costume gaffes and exhausting 14-hour days on the festival circuit.
"These relationships have mostly been distilled to work and periodic messages that say, ‘I love you. I miss you. I can't wait to hug you again,' " Ms. Roy said.
When Natasha Carpio lost her job at the Hyatt Regency Vancouver during the pandemic, she also lost the world she and close colleagues built over 12 years: inside jokes, informal therapy sessions, Tim Hortons runs and after-work drinks. Ms. Carpio, 41, spent more time with her work friends than with her own family.
"They get insight into your everyday life that your loved ones don't get to see," said Ms. Carpio, who especially misses Trina, her "BFAW" - Best Friend at Work.
Once inseparable, the women now call and text sporadically.
In Hamilton, Allison Ward worries the community she forged at her Aqua-Fit classes might be broken forever. Before the pandemic, she'd hop in the pool three or four times a week with a group of mostly retired women.
Flapping in the water, they shared the ups and downs of life.
At 34, Ms. Ward was an object of curiosity: The older women wanted to hear about her wedding (a small, family-only ceremony held last October) and dole out marriage advice. She wanted to about know about retired life, grandkids and ailing friends.
"They gave me a real feeling of being part of my immediate community and getting to meet people I wouldn't usually," said Ms. Ward, a project manager.
Isolating through the pandemic, Ms. Ward found there isn't as much news to share with her husband since they've been home together so much. "In hindsight, my Aqua-Fit group provided me with surprises," she said.
Typically, other significant others get to know us in contexts different from those inhabited by our spouses. Ms. Larson believes having OSOs means having more well-rounded perspectives, beyond marriage.
"Society doesn't prioritize friendships as much as it does romantic partners and that's wrong-headed," she said. "You need a much broader village to go through life."

Full text: Two of MEC's new executives were rooting around in their distribution centre in Surrey, B.C., one day this past January when they struck gold.
There, tucked away in a musty 53-foot container, was a pile of snowshoes - a precious resource for an outdoor goods retailer in the middle of a pandemic winter.
With cooped-up Canadians flocking to the country's wide-open spaces, setting eyes on a bunch of unsold snowshoes was like finding a sasquatch.
President and chief operating officer Jay Taylor and chief financial officer Peter Hlynsky loaded the loot into a truck and a Jeep, alongside a few other finds - downhill and cross-country skis, boots and poles - and headed for MEC's North Vancouver store.
Within a day, everything was sold out.
But the snowshoes were a symptom of a larger problem: After years of mismanagement and losing money, the retail chain's operations were plagued with inefficiencies, at a time when it should have been capitalizing on a surge in demand for its products.
Almost any retailer could find some unaccounted-for stock buried in a distribution centre. But MEC was sitting on a $4-million product backlog. For years, rather than running clearance sales, MEC stores had been packing up unsold goods at the end of each season and shipping them back to the warehouse. There, if they didn't get lost in storage, they were either sold off online or eventually shipped back to stores - in both cases, racking up labour and shipping costs that eroded profits.
"It was like throwing 100-dollar bills in the river and watching them float away," Mr. Taylor says.
Six months after joining MEC, he and three other new executives - including Mr. Hlynsky and chief executive officer Eric Claus - are in the midst of a turnaround plan. It is not the first one attempted at the beleaguered retailer.
In 2020, after years of mounting losses and saddled with more than $70-million in debt, MEC's balance sheet was in no shape to withstand the body blow of COVID-19. Even spiking e-commerce sales couldn't make up for losses from mandated store closings and lockdowns. The crisis led to the biggest drop in retail sales in Canada since the 2009 financial crisis, and pushed more than a dozen domestic chains into creditor protection last year.
With MEC already operating on a razor's edge, its very survival was at stake.
In September, the co-op announced it was entering creditor protection in order to sell the chain to California-based private equity firm Kingswood Capital Management. It was a controversial deal, not only because MEC was such a well-known Canadian brand, but because the sale would put an end to its co-operative structure, in which members felt a sense of ownership. Some of those members fought the sale, arguing they should have been consulted first.
With stronger financial backing, the managers of what is now known as Mountain Equipment Co.
have to do more than just fix ailing operations. They also have to salvage a 50-year-old Canadian brand with an uncommonly opinionated customer base and woo back those who have become disillusioned. And all this while a global pandemic continues to rage.
"It's like you're in a fire, because you're in the middle of COVID," Mr. Claus says. "So while we're all running around with fire hoses, at the same time we still step back and talk about strategy ... so we can deal with the future."
Just more than a year ago - or an eternity, in COVID times - MEC's former CEO, Phil Arrata, was also thinking about the future.
"We're on a transformation journey," Mr. Arrata said in an interview in January, 2020. By then, MEC was already in crisis. In the decades since the co-op was founded by a group of rock climbers in British Columbia, MEC had expanded into a nationwide retailer. But it had lost touch with its roots, stocking items such as pet accessories and denim that didn't fit with its brand. MEC had also spent heavily on new stores and an expensive head office in Vancouver.
When it began losing money, "patronage returns" - a share of profits distributed to members - flatlined.
Alienated members began to complain management had grown too corporate and out of touch.
Mr. Arrata's plan to stem the losses included finding cheaper head-office space; smoothing out its logistics; and streamlining MEC's scattered product assortment.
"At that time, the executive team hit the ground running and put together some really solid plans to support moving this company through this financial situation we were in," says chief human resources officer Deb Paulsen, who has been with MEC since September, 2019.
But then COVID hit, and long-term strategy took a backseat to short-term survival.
MEC had lost roughly $80-million between 2017 to 2020 (excluding gains from real estate transactions), and the pandemic only made things worse.
In the first seven months of its most recent fiscal year (which began in late February, 2020), MEC lost another $20.9-million.
It had also been through a sweeping round of staff cuts - not all of them temporary layoffs because of COVID. From January, 2020, to early September, the work force shrunk by 37 per cent, from roughly 2,400 people to 1,516.
Still, the $150-million deal to sell MEC to Kingswood came as a surprise to both co-op members and employees.
In MEC's Ottawa store, morning meetings included a new ritual. On a flip chart, manager Chris Chapman drew a curve with the Kubler-Ross stages of grief - from shock, to denial, all the way to acceptance - and invited staff to use sticky dots to indicate where they were on the spectrum. "There was a high level of uncertainty," Mr. Chapman says. "You saw the public's reaction [to the sale]. Imagine working for them." On the day he told workers they wouldn't lose their benefits under the new ownership, he says it was as though the air in the room became lighter, and eventually, the dots moved beyond "the pit of despair."
Mr. Chapman - who has spent a decade at MEC - saw the cracks appearing as far back as 2013. Employees had already lived through turnarounds and uncertainty. "Working for a co-op was incredible," he says. "But better we're here and successful than not at all."
The deal kept 21 out of 22 stores open. Still, the fight over the future of the retailer dealt a blow to MEC's brand. The co-op structure meant members had the right to vote on its leadership. Some of them - already dissatisfied with the chain's management team - were upset to see the co-op dissolved altogether. Others bristled at an independent Canadian business handed over to American ownership.
"The reaction - which was pretty dramatic - we think is a testament to how strongly people feel about the brand and the desire for the brand to continue," says Alex Wolf, Kingswood's founder and managing partner, in his first interview since buying MEC. "We believe our plan - probably more than other potential outcomes - preserves this in a big way."
At a companywide town hall held on Microsoft Teams in February, Mr. Claus - Kingswood's chosen successor to Mr. Arrata - acknowledged it was "sad" to lose the co-op. Speaking against a virtual background depicting sparkling blue water surrounded by lush evergreens and snow-capped mountains, his message was that MEC's roots as a destination for outdoor enthusiasts would be preserved.
"Kingswood and the private equity world got a bad rap," Mr. Claus, a former grocery executive who had consulted for Kingswood on other potential retail deals, said during his presentation. "Private equity in many ways deserves that, in many businesses that they go into. But in this particular case ... our investors really understand, and they believe in supporting a business that is based on good values, good ethics and a view to something more than making money."
With financial backing, the new management had more room to breathe. But there were costs that needed cutting right away.
When the new team took over at the end of October, they walked into a head office Mr. Claus calls the "Taj Mahal," too large for its headcount. With almost everyone working from home, the place seemed frozen in time: glasses abandoned on desks and papers lying where they had been since March. By moving into more modest digs a block away, the company saved more than $4million in annual lease costs. MEC also renegotiated many of its store leases with landlords.
There were more difficult cuts, including laying off roughly 100 head-office staff. Some other employees, whose jobs were cut while MEC was still in creditor protection, have filed claims with the monitor overseeing the process, saying the severance offered to them is less than what they are due.
"I was extremely loyal to the co-op," says Placido Cerce, who worked at MEC for nearly three decades, most recently at its Toronto store, before he was fired by e-mail last October. Mr. Cerce did not contest his settlement.
"There's a tendency for that last painful bit to stick out to me. But I have to remind myself there were 28 years before that that were all really great."
MEC also hired more staff in the retail network. It had 1,284 employees at the time of the sale and now has 1,332. That number will continue to change; roughly 60 positions will be cut next month when MEC closes its distribution centre in Brampton, Ont., outsourcing to a third-party logistics provider.
During creditor protection in September, MEC reported it was burning through roughly $1.6million in cash every week. The company is now cash-positive,
according to executives.
With the initial cost-cutting completed, more fundamental changes to MEC's operations are now on the docket.
"The last thing we want to do is turn this into some big-box American type of chain," Mr. Claus says.
"We want to build on what was built over 50 years."
By 10:45 on the morning of March 2, the lineup for MEC's liquidation sale at its West Broadway store in Vancouver already stretched down the street, and it wasn't even open to the public yet - just staff and their families.
The sale was a potpourri of excess inventory: old gym equipment, dog leashes, bathing suits, some items priced as low as $1. A $10,000 kayak was going for $3,000. It was all perfectly serviceable merchandise, but for MEC, it was functionally obsolete - either too many seasons out of date or in numbers or sizes too irregular to be properly allocated to stores.
"For a retailer our size to have this much product hanging around is a tad embarrassing," Mr. Taylor says.
Over the years, MEC had also moved into categories that did not fit with its overall mission of selling outdoor gear. Under the new merchandising strategy, led by chief product officer Adam Ketcheson, it's starting to pare back the number of brands it sells, as well as the number of products. (You only need so many types of water bottle.) Buying a narrower assortment, but going deeper on the items the team believes shoppers will want, will be a big shift in strategy. The trick is to buy items that either fit hardcore, gear-obsessed customers or those who are brand new to pursuits such as camping, climbing and canoeing.
"If you design for the extremes, you almost always catch the middle," Mr. Ketcheson says.
Before the company could revamp its merchandising, however, it had to convince product vendors the new MEC was credit-worthy, after a year in which product orders had been abruptly cancelled because of COVID and the retailer had gone through creditor protection. Executives spent hours working the phone lines with suppliers, and suppliers' insurers, to re-establish credit necessary to place orders.
In a typical creditor-protection situation, suppliers "get stuck" with only part of what they're owed, says John Condon, president of Wolverine Worldwide Canada, which sells the Merrell and Saucony brands to MEC. "We walked away [from the first phone call] going, ‘Hoo, that went differently than we thought,' " he says. "We got paid in full, which is almost unheard of."
Then there's MEC's own private label, which makes up about one-third of the business, but has been losing money in recent years.
A symbol of the inefficiency is the Toaster Suit. MEC sells 8,000 to 10,000 of these one-piece kids snowsuits each year, but the mark-up has been extremely narrow because of how it's made and shipped. The cuff alone is a quagmire: MEC buys this piece from a company in Italy, which makes it in Turkey and ships it to El Salvador to get it sewn onto the rest of the suit. That's about to change.
"They identified how to take $4 out of the suit by changing the lining to a recycled material," Mr. Taylor says, "but couldn't get the go-ahead because it's the Toaster Suit - we can't screw it up."
Another example: Even while the apparel industry changed dramatically, MEC continued buying its own fabric, accepting the liability for any leftovers, rather than offloading that risk to its factory partners. Making MEC label more efficient by fixing these kinds of problems is a priority. So is renegotiating minimum mandatory purchases from factories, to more closely align with the amount of product MEC can actually sell.
No matter how tight the merchandising strategy, every retailer ends up with excess stock. This was another area where MEC got into trouble.
In the past, a store manager's bonus relied partly on their location's contribution to the co-op's gross margins. Because clearance sales cut into margins, managers were incentivized to pack up end-of-season product and ship it to warehouses, rather than selling it at a discount.
That meant MEC was paying to ship items back and forth between stores and distribution centres - and again to customers, if clearance items were sold online - along with the labour to pack and unpack that inventory multiple times.
On a video call at the end of March, the merchandising team discussed how to make changes. The idea now is to keep as much product in stores as possible, making managers responsible for selling off expiring stock. But store displays flip from snow sports to water sports when the seasons change, and with limited storage at each location, those products have to go somewhere.
"This is a legacy MEC problem," says Brodie Wallace, MEC's director of hard goods.
Another major change to MEC's logistics will be buying products specifically for e-commerce, with a separate pool of inventory allocated to stores.
Roughly half of MEC's e-commerce orders shipped from stores as of November. By this fall, the goal is 20 per cent.
Stores have already begun to see some movement. On a regular morning store managers call in early February - after Montreal-based manager Benoit Perrier played summery music to offset the snow falling outside his window - assistant inventory manager Sylvain Robba explained that with ecommerce purchases still higher than usual, MEC would be holding more inventory dedicated to web orders at the distribution centres.
"It should reduce the ship-from-store situations, and reduce our shipping costs," he said. "It will also benefit our members, as it should be less parcels that you can receive for one order."
All these strategic changes are happening while the merchandising team is also grappling with a global supply chain that has been thrown completely out of whack by COVID. At the end of March, MEC was still $15-million light on inventory going into the summer season. Trying to source bicycles? Good luck. Bike-parts manufacturers are quoting 600-day lead times for orders, compared with an industry norm of 60 to 90 days in the before times. The largest cross-country ski factory in the world burned down in November - because 2020. Shipping delays are rampant.
On another video meeting in mid-March, the team discussed the possibility of shipping tents by air rather than by boat, just to ensure they'd have stock in time for camping season. One problem: The additional cost would eat up most of the margin on those items.
"It's whether you want market share or whether you want market dollars, at the end of the day," Mr. Wallace told his colleagues. They decided to fly in roughly 3,000 tents.
As Canadians approach another summer of vacation-planning around restricted international travel, sales in MEC's camping department have already doubled year to date compared with 2020. It will be a scramble to keep up.
"I've got a couple of used tents in my basement," Mr. Taylor joked. "You want to sell those, Brodie?" At MEC, there are some stories that have become legend. Among them is the tale of the Love Boat.
Many years back, a couple bought a top-of-theline canoe to use at their wedding. After the festivities, they brought it back, saying they weren't satisfied with the product - which in the meantime, had been spray-painted with the words "Love Boat" in fluorescent pink on the side of the canoe. No problem. Refund granted.
For decades, MEC's "Rock Solid Guarantee" has been one of the most liberal return policies in the business. The vast majority of returns are legitimate, but there are a small number of brazen folk who abuse the laxity, returning a hiking boot with a melted sole from being propped up too close to a campfire, for example, or a set of skis used for an entire season. Other retailers have already scaled back. L.L.
Bean, which famously had a 100-per-cent satisfaction guarantee for more than a century, announced in 2018 it was imposing some limits, citing abuse.
MEC is now mulling whether to institute some limits as well, although this would be a delicate dance between ensuring its policies are responsible and protecting its brand.
Some members who opposed MEC's were outspoken enough to make news. And this had an impact on public perceptions of the retailer. Store staff are still fielding queries from some shoppers who think MEC is bankrupt, wondering when they're closing down for good.
MEC is about to step up its marketing efforts to tell a different story. It's also launching a loyalty program, trying to give shoppers who paid $5 for an ownership stake in the co-op a sense of continuing value for their membership. MEC is also continuing its support of causes such as the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society, and public safety programs through Avalanche Canada, in a bid to show customers its community engagement is not being gutted. It has launched new sustainability targets. And it is reinstating wilderness outing programs - a past practice that both boosted morale and ensured sales staff were knowledgeable about products needed for excursions - that fell by the wayside during MEC's financial troubles.
With the retailer's finances shored up, basic things such as store repairs that were delayed in the past are now happening: At the North Vancouver store, the roof is fixed, and the heating and cooling system is back to working properly.
"We see change happen faster," store manager Caitlin Brown says.
"When we provide feedback, [stores] get action quicker."
Steven Jones, a member who vocally opposed the sale, has not shopped at MEC lately. Like many people, he has been trying to support smaller, local businesses during the pandemic. But he's not boycotting the chain, he says.
He'll be watching to see whether the new owners continue supporting both national causes and community initiatives, such as trail building and advocacy groups. He says he believes the retailer has a strong future, in part because of the number of people who've embraced the outdoors over the past year.
"A lot of people who have been introduced to these activities during the pandemic will keep doing it, because it's awesome," he says.
"The business is great. That's why I wanted to save it. ... As a former member, it was sad to see we couldn't find a solution that would have retained the organization as a co-op."
There are the days when planning for the future takes a backseat to the present crisis.
In a video meeting on Feb. 16, regional manager Glenda Rowley took a moment to congratulate Ontario stores that were reopening that day after COVID-related shutdowns, and the Toronto locations set to open the following week. Managers on the call responded with a flurry of GIFs - such as Jennifer Lopez standing up to applaud - over the Microsoft Teams chat function.
Just seven weeks later, retailers received news of renewed lockdowns in Ontario, which would mean another round of temporary layoffs.
"All our plans today - everything got cancelled," Mr. Claus said on April 7. Instead of another round of strategy meetings, the firehoses were out again. The company had to reassure employees that despite the short-term pain, MEC wasn't going anywhere. "They've been through this before. ... But we have the cash flow. We have the balance sheet. We can get through this."
While MEC closed one store while in creditor protection, and cancelled leases on some stores that were yet to open, Kingswood's Mr. Wolf says he believes there's room to grow and potentially open more locations.
Private-equity investors often look for exit opportunities to make their money within three to five years.
Mr. Wolf says Kingswood typically looks at five-year holds on average, but has flexibility to go on longer if needed.
"I believe if our team executes, as we expect that they will, there will certainly be interested parties, if and when we look to exit," he says.
MEC's financial health has been improving. In November, just after the sale was completed, revenue was down by a percentage in the mid-30s compared with the year before, according to CFO Mr. Hlynsky.
By March, the drop in sales had shrunk to the mid-single-digits compared with March, 2019 - and that's with roughly 30 per cent less inventory.
For the first time in years, MEC has money and time to implement a new strategy. But until it's on the other side of the biggest crisis to hit retail in decades, developing a clear picture of the long-term health of the business will be difficult. Amid the most recent wave, eight stores have been forced to close and roughly 60 employees sent home. Even still, Mr. Claus is confident.
"In every single month [since the sale], we've made money," he says, adding that was true even in the traditionally slow months from January to March.
"It's going to be a good business."

Full text: When Sohel Imani went looking for a second location for his bike shop in Toronto's West End, he knew he'd be able to leverage the city's current commercial rental market.
With dozens of storefronts sitting empty in any given Toronto neighbourhood, Mr. Imani says he knew he could throw out lowball offers for rental spaces because there were any number of other lots for lease that he could go to if an owner flat-out refused.
Last month, the second location of Ya Bikes opened in Toronto's Roncesvalles neighbourhood, with Mr. Imani saying he was pleased to lock in a long-term deal at a very favourable rate.
Mr. Imani and his co-owner knew that now was the time to jump on a space before prices rebounded.
Commercial real estate agents and members of BIAs around Canada say the current climate is a prime opportunity for a business to get a new location at a favourable rate if they've managed to stay afloat despite the pandemic.
"Retail has been crushed downtown - all you have to do is walk around," said Andrew Baker, a broker of record with Lennard Commercial Realty, which operates in Toronto and surrounding cities.
Mr. Baker said the current situation is similar to the economic downturn in the early 1990s, when some businesses such as law firms were able to lock in extremely cheap rental contracts that were deeply beneficial to their business in the long term.
He said he's currently working with the owner of a physiotherapy practice in Mississauga that's looking to double in size while capitalizing on the current vacancy rates.
"It'll probably set her and her business up for long-term profitability for the duration of the lease."
While experts say there are similar opportunities in cities like Vancouver and Edmonton, not every major urban centre has a rosy renter's market.
In downtown Calgary, the executive director of the Beltline Business Improvement Area said many vacant commercial lots are owned by large real estate corporations that are unwilling to drop their rates, despite sky-high vacancy rates around the 35-per-cent mark.
Adrian Urlacher said the owners in his downtown district generally prefer to have their spaces used for offices, rather than retail or arts spaces.
"I think the problem is we have larger interest groups that come from out-of-market that see no need to drop rents because they're financed and make their money elsewhere," Mr. Urlacher explained.
With rates at a standstill, Mr. Urlacher said local businesses already in the area are suffering, while new businesses haven't been able to enter the neighbourhood and help revitalize it.
"We have iconic buildings in the Beltline, heritage buildings, that haven't been rented out for 10 years plus," Mr. Urlacher said.
Mr. Baker, of Lennard Realty, said small businesses in other cities with more of a renter's market should look at the current situation as an opportunity.

Home prices, sales hit records as calls grow to calm demand

Full text: Canadian home sales and prices hit another record in March, with prices spiralling up in most of Ontario as calls intensified for measures to slow the country's unruly market.
There were 76,259 home resales last month, according to the Canadian Real Estate Association, surpassing the previous record set last July when much of the country emerged from initial pandemic lockdowns and pent-up demand fuelled a surge in sales.
"All policy makers should be actively considering measures that they could take to calm demand, with the focus on steps that don't have spillover effects into other areas," said Bank of Montreal chief economist Douglas Porter.
For most of the health crisis, house prices have soared, with low borrowing costs and the pandemic's stay-at-home requirements driving competition for bigger properties. The home price index, which adjusts for pricing volatility, was up 3 per cent from February to March on a seasonally adjusted basis to a record $713,700.
That was 20 per cent higher than March of last year. (The average selling price, where expensive transactions will skew the price higher, is up 31 per cent year-over-year to $716,828.)
"The pace of Canadian home sales and prices is simply in uncharted territory," Mr. Porter said in a note.
"Given the extreme market imbalance currently at play, almost entirely due to fiery demand, look for the record pace of price gains to spread far and wide beyond Ontario."
Across the country, properties in smaller cities, semi-rural areas and suburbs have received multiple offers, bids well over the asking price and unconditional offers. The 3-per-cent price index gain in March was down slightly from a 3.3-percent jump in February. But those monthly price increases are still the steepest on record and have outpaced the housing boom of 2017, according to CREA data.
There were a record number of new listings, though that did little to satisfy demand. The inventory of houses for sale remained at record lows with the extreme shortages across most of Ontario. More than 40 regions in the most populated province had less than one month of inventory as of the end of March. That includes Barrie, Cambridge, Guelph, Ottawa, Woodstock, Ingersoll and the Toronto region, the country's biggest market.
Economists renewed calls for some kind of action to cool the market. Royal Bank of Canada senior economist Robert Hogue said demand was far outstripping supply and warrants some policy response. Mr. Hogue has previously urged policy makers to put everything on the table, including taxing capital gains on the sale of principal residences.
Beata Caranci, chief economist with Toronto-Dominion Bank, said timely data on house flippers and investors are needed to tailor policies to discourage speculation.
Bank of Nova Scotia chief economist Jean-François Perrault said he has long favoured measures to reduce excessive speculation in housing markets.
BMO's Mr. Porter compared sales and prices with the prepandemic days of March, 2019, and said the two-year jump "absolutely shatters the prior record gain, seen back in the bubble days of the late 1980s." The housing shortage has led to fierce competition and big price increases. In Bancroft, a semi-rural area in Ontario, the home price index rose 9.4 per cent from February to March. In the smaller market of Woodstock and Ingersoll, the index was up 8 per cent month over month.
Other areas with month-overmonth price index increases of more than 5 per cent include Niagara, Huron Perth and Southern Georgian Bay. Ottawa's home price index also rose more than 5 per cent. The only area outside of Ontario to see a massive price increase was the Chilliwack district in British Columbia, which rose 6.4 per cent month over month to $647,300.
"I have never seen the balance tip so much in favour of sellers," said Robin Wiebe, senior economist with the Conference Board of Canada, who has studied the country's housing market for more than two decades.
Over the past three months, the selling price for a typical detached house has increased by at least $100,000 in the major urban centres of Toronto and Vancouver, as well as the nearby suburbs of Oakville, Milton, Mississauga, Hamilton, Burlington and the Fraser Valley in B.C. Smaller regions such as Cambridge, Guelph and Woodstock have also seen price increases in that order of magnitude.
Although Canada's bank regulator plans to make it harder for borrowers to qualify for a mortgage, economists do not expect this to have a big impact on prices, nor break market psychology that home prices will continue to rise.
It is unknown if the federal government will introduce additional measures when it unveils its budget on Monday. Earlier in April, BMO had issued a report analyzing the benefits and unintended consequences of 10 policies that could slow the market, including higher interest rates and various taxes.
The report suggested that a more transparent bidding process would be the most effective policy. For the most part, the bidding process is blind in Canada, which means buyers will often spend tens of thousands more than the second-highest bidder.
TD's Ms. Caranci agreed that more transparency is needed.
"A review of local market practices should occur to ensure that a seller's market doesn't turn into a runaway market due to practices that can jawbone buyers, like price-baiting or gaming the lack of transparency on the bid process," she said in a note.
Mr. Porter said imposing the foreign buyers' tax outside of the Toronto region and to the rest of the province could have some impact.
"Some of the hottest price gains in the country are in smaller Ontario cities," he said. "It may not have a big impact, but there's little cost to at least trying that."
Two bank chief executive officers, at RBC and TD, have voiced opposition to removing the capital gains tax exemption on primary residences.

Full text: More than 10,000 pages of recently unsealed court documents show that dealings between a senior Toronto hospital executive and a construction company chief executive officer were far more extensive than reported so far, and the pair went to great lengths to conceal them.
Vas Georgiou was chief administrative officer of St. Michael's Hospital from 2013 to 2015, and John Aquino was CEO of Bondfield Construction Co. Ltd. when it won the coveted contract to create Canada's premier critical-care centre in 2015 - a $300-million project that is mired in protracted delays. The unsealed documents were filed by Zurich Insurance Co. Ltd., which issued surety bonds on the project.
The multinational insurer alleges Mr. Georgiou received kickbacks, including free home renovations, and "secretly obtained" shares, worth at least $500,000, in companies owned by Mr. Aquino. Details of the alleged kickbacks - contained in e-mails and transcripts - were barred from public view. But the records were released in March after The Globe and Mail successfully fought a judge's order that sealed them.
Zurich alleges the unsealed evidence shows: Mr. Georgiou funnelled confidential information to Bondfield throughout the bidding process.
Mr. Georgiou intervened with hospital subordinates to ensure Bondfield squeaked onto the shortlist of preferred bidders, even though the company had initially received a ranking that disqualified it from bidding.
Even after Mr. Georgiou was fired by St.
Michael's in 2015, he continued to use his influence to help Bondfield. In a 2017 e-mail, he urged Mr. Aquino to "get something" for Michael Mendonca, the hospital's vice-president of the redevelopment, and who was recruited to the hospital by Mr. Georgiou.
The alleged kickbacks were discovered by Zurich after it launched a lawsuit last year against Mr. Georgiou, Mr. Aquino and Unity Health Toronto - the hospital network that includes St. Michael's - arguing the two men orchestrated a "bid-rigging scheme" to ensure Bondfield won the contract.
None of the allegations have been proved in court. Lawyers for Mr. Aquino and Mr. Georgiou said it would be inappropriate for them to comment while the matter is before the courts. Mr. Georgiou's lawyer said her client denies any wrongdoing.
Zurich is seeking a court order to rescind the surety bonds it issued. Those bonds are insurance-like contracts that were supposed to act as a safety net for the project, and required Zurich to foot the bill in the event Bondfield faltered.
And falter it did. Bondfield collapsed in 2019, fired Mr. Aquino as CEO and sought court protection from creditors. Zurich, which issued bonds for dozens of Bondfield's public infrastructure contracts across the province, was forced to insert itself into the company's affairs.
Once installed at Bondfield's headquarters north of Toronto, Zurich found evidence that Mr. Aquino and Mr. Georgiou had been improperly exchanging information throughout the St. Michael's bidding process. Mr. Aquino had provided Mr. Georgiou with a secret BlackBerry and even his own bondfield.com e-mail address, which they used to pass messages.
Zurich also discovered that when The Globe began publishing stories in September, 2015, about the close ties between the two men, Mr. Aquino ordered his IT staff to wipe all references to Mr. Georgiou from the company's e-mail server. The mass deletion of those estimated 5,000 e-mails, however, did not capture every mention of Mr. Georgiou. Zurich found scores of internal Bondfield documents - with notations such as "owe Vas $500,000" - allegedly showing Mr. Georgiou received multiple benefits from Bondfield before, during and after the St. Michael's procurement.
Zurich argues that the alleged collusion should nullify any obligation it has to pay for the completion of the project. If the insurance giant is successful, it raises questions about who will ultimately pay for the redevelopment, which is 31/2 years behind schedule and has left the hospital with an unfinished project in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The records Zurich has pried out of Bondfield's computer servers also call into question the efforts - or lack thereof - of Infrastructure Ontario, the province's procurement arm, to unravel the relationship between the two men.
Globe stories in 2015 and 2016 about Mr. Georgiou and Mr. Aquino detailed how they were involved in multiple businesses together, including a commercial real estate company and a bottled water venture, when Mr. Georgiou was supposed to be acting as a neutral evaluator of bidders.
In response to the revelations, the hospital and Infrastructure Ontario each hired teams of lawyers and forensic investigators, neither of which found evidence of the alleged kickbacks. A special committee of the board of Infrastructure Ontario went so far as to conclude that the "St. Michael's Hospital procurement was not compromised."
Bondfield, meanwhile, launched a $125million libel lawsuit against The Globe. But that lawsuit has been effectively dead since Bondfield sought bankruptcy protection.
Now, a recently established investigative agency of police officers and prosecutors, Ontario's Serious Fraud Office, has launched a sweeping probe into Mr. Aquino, Mr. Georgiou and the procurement.
Both Infrastructure Ontario and Unity Health Toronto, the network of hospitals that includes St. Michael's, said in separate statements that they are co-operating with the police.
On March 19, The Globe successfully argued to Ontario Superior Court Justice Cory Gilmore that the records uncovered by Zurich should be released to the public. Mr. Aquino, Mr. Georgiou and Unity Health opposed the disclosure.
Mr. Georgiou denies he tipped the scales in favour of Bondfield. He was part of a steering committee of four senior officials who approved the short list of bidders, and another steering committee of four who ultimately recommended Bondfield win the contract - decisions by consensus that, he says, eliminated any outsized influence he may have tried to wield. "No one person ... could materially influence or direct the outcome of the procurement process," he has argued in court filings.
‘VAS IS IN!' St. Michael's Hospital, founded in 1892 with a mission of treating Toronto's poor and vulnerable, long ago outgrew the space it occupies. A warren of crowded hallways with low-hanging ceilings, much of the facility belies the hospital's world-class reputation for research and care.
By late 2012, the Ontario government had approved a major redevelopment, including a brand new 17-floor patient-care tower.
Now, St. Michael's just needed someone to manage the project.
The hospital believed it had just the man for the job - an executive with a background in health care and construction.
Vas Georgiou had been the chief administrative officer of Infrastructure Ontario, the agency responsible for all of the province's major public-sector building projects, and before that, a senior executive at another Toronto hospital, St. Joseph's Health Centre.
But a month before St. Michael's even announced Mr. Georgiou's appointment publicly in January, 2013, celebrations had begun in Bondfield's head office.
On Dec. 18, 2012, Bondfield's John Aquino, one of the company's owners, received an e-mail from a colleague, "vas is in!"
Mr. Aquino and his company had many reasons to cheer the news. Bondfield, a midsized, family-owned construction company, was making a push to join the ranks of Ontario's biggest players in public infrastructure. Winning the St. Michael's contract would elevate the company into the big leagues with rivals EllisDon and PCL Construction.
And with Mr. Georgiou in a position of influence, Bondfield had a clear edge. Not only was Mr. Georgiou friends with Mr. Aquino, the two men were working together on multiple business ventures - a pair of commercial buildings in midtown Toronto, as well as a bottled water company, GP8 Sportwater. Neither disclosed these conflicts of interest in declarations they were required to fill out at the start of the St. Michael's procurement.
But what few outside of Bondfield knew, until Zurich filed its materials in court, was that, over the years, Mr. Aquino had ordered his staff to perform many hours of free labour at Mr. Georgiou's house in north Toronto. This included landscaping his yard, demolishing his driveway, carpentry inside his residence and working on his gazebo.
In April, 2012, about seven months before Mr. Georgiou started negotiations to join St.
Michael's, Mr. Aquino e-mailed one of his subordinates: "Call vas. We need to finish a few things at his place." Other e-mails from 2013, 2014 and 2015 show Bondfield staff asked Mr. Aquino for instructions about how to record work done at "Vas house" or "Vas's house."
Another e-mail from June 10, 2015 - after the St. Michael's contract was awarded to Bondfield - shows that a Bondfield landscaper wanted to know how he should pay for $4,000 worth of artificial turf Mr. Georgiou wanted for his backyard. A 2018 satellite image of Mr. Georgiou's yard, examined by The Globe and taken at a time of year when everyone else's lawn is drab and grey, shows a patch of bright green turf next to his pool and gazebo.
In 2020, Mr. Aquino was examined by lawyers for Zurich, and a transcript was part of the court filings unsealed at the request of The Globe. Under questioning by Zurich's lawyer, Matthew Lerner, Mr. Aquino acknowledged Bondfield performed all of this work free of charge. "He didn't pay because he was a friend and a client," he said.
Mr. Aquino did not specify when the work began, but suggested it started while Mr. Georgiou was a senior executive at Infrastructure Ontario - the procurement agency that had awarded Bondfield several contracts, including multiple hospital projects and some of the facilities for the 2015 Pan American Games in Toronto. Mr. Georgiou worked at Infrastructure Ontario from 2006 until he was dismissed in 2012, after he was implicated in a false invoice scheme at Toronto's York University.
"Is it fair to say you were doing this as a favour to him because of his role and influence at Infrastructure Ontario?" Mr. Lerner asked.
"Absolutely," Mr. Aquino replied.
When Mr. Georgiou was examined under oath, his lawyers declined to allow him to answer any questions about the work Bondfield performed - with one exception. When he was asked about a 2013 e-mail from Mr. Aquino, which showed Bondfield replaced eight dead trees on Mr. Georgiou's property, Mr. Georgiou replied, "I paid for those trees."
He explained that he paid Mr. Aquino in cash and sports tickets.
That same 2013 e-mail also raises questions about who was ultimately paying for the work on Mr. Georgiou's home. In the e-mail, Mr. Aquino directed a Bondfield staffer to charge the work on Mr. Georgiou's home to "Pick Go." This is a reference to a parking garage Bondfield was building at the time at a Pickering, Ont., GO Transit station, Zurich alleges.
In an e-mailed statement, a spokesperson for Metrolinx, the provincial agency that oversees GO Transit, said it learned about this allocation because of The Globe's inquiries. The agency is investigating these "troubling allegations," said spokeswoman Anne Marie Aikins.
The Pickering parking garage contract was awarded on a lump-sum basis, and therefore, any extra costs should be borne by Bondfield, not Metrolinx, Ms. Aikins said.
In his examination for discovery, Mr. Aquino refused, on the advice of his lawyers, to answer questions about his direction to record the costs to the GO parking garage.
For its part, Unity Health spokeswoman Sabrina Divell told The Globe that St. Michael's had no knowledge at the time about the work done on Mr. Georgiou's home.
‘OWE VAS $500,000' Other evidence uncovered by Zurich, the company alleges, shows that Mr. Aquino provided Mr. Georgiou with shares in businesses he owned.
In addition to running Bondfield, Mr. Aquino owned interests in numerous side ventures, including several residential housing developments and commercial buildings. Two of those buildings, on Gervais Drive in midtown Toronto, housed multiple commercial tenants. A spreadsheet of all of Mr. Aquino's assets, found on Bondfield's servers, included a notation next to the company that owned the buildings: "Owe Vas $500,000."
Under questioning by Zurich's lawyers, Mr. Aquino said he had "gifted" about $50,000 worth of shares in the company to Mr. Georgiou in 2012, before he was hired by St. Michael's. Asked what Mr. Georgiou was supposed to do for the remaining $450,000, Mr. Aquino said he could earn it by giving him "assistance, advice, you know, like a - like a finder's fee."
Mr. Aquino said Mr. Georgiou didn't do anything to earn the remaining $450,000, and he had no explanation for the spreadsheet that indicated he owed Mr. Georgiou $500,000. For his part, Mr. Georgiou denied, in his examination, having any interest whatsoever in the buildings. "I did not invest," he said.
Zurich also alleges that other records show the two men were co-owners of another business - Potentia Solar Inc. Potentia, which landed a $1.2-billion contract in 2011 to outfit Toronto public schools with solar panels, was owned by people close to both men. (It has since been purchased by the Power Corp. family of companies and renamed Potentia Renewables.)
In 2014 - in the middle of the St. Michael's procurement - Bondfield's then controller, Domenic Dipede, exchanged e-mails with another Potentia shareholder, Ted Manziaris, about Mr. Aquino and Mr. Georgiou investing.
Mr. Dipede wrote that Mr. Aquino was ready to invest, including "an additional $150k from Vas."
"Please let me know whom the cheque should be made payable to and if it needs to be certified."
When questioned by Zurich's lawyers, Mr. Georgiou insists he didn't invest. Mr. Aquino said that, when it came to Potentia, "Vas didn't get a penny from me." Mr. Aquino declined to answer any questions about why he didn't disclose the two of them having ownership stakes before bidding on the St. Michael's project.
‘I AM WITH VAS. WE WILL BE OK.' After Mr. Georgiou joined the hospital, the first hurdle Bondfield had to clear was the Request for Qualifications, or RFQ.
That phase is designed to narrow the potential bidders down to a short list of the three top candidates. Five companies were vying for the contract: PCL, EllisDon, Bondfield, Turner Construction and Brookfield Multiplex.
E-mails recovered by Zurich show Mr. Aquino took comfort that Mr. Georgiou was in place for the RFQ.
On Jan. 29, 2013 - just a few weeks after Mr. Georgiou started his new job at the hospital - a Bondfield employee e-mailed Mr. Aquino to tell him he was working on the company's submission.
Mr. Aquino replied, at 11:10 p.m., "Good. I am with Vas. We will be ok." Asked by Zurich's lawyers what he was doing with Mr. Georgiou so late at night, Mr. Aquino replied, "Maybe having a cigar."
But when a team of evaluators first scored the bidders, they put Bondfield in fourth place - a ranking that, if allowed to stand, would eliminate the company from the race.
On March 19, 2013, those evaluators presented their scores to Mr. Georgiou's steering committee, which was also made up of two officials from Infrastructure Ontario and a St.
Michael's official. But instead of accepting the scores, the steering committee sent the evaluators back to re-evaluate.
Two days later, they returned with new scores, and this time Bondfield had moved into third place, replacing Turner Construction, which had been knocked down to fourth.
Pressed to explain this by Zurich's lawyers, Mr. Georgiou said Infrastructure Ontario had introduced new criteria that placed more emphasis on "local experience," and the evaluators had not properly considered this in their initial scoring. Turner Construction has an office in Toronto, but is headquartered in New York.
Michael Keen, who is now vice-president of facilities at St. Michael's, but at the time was one of the evaluators, was also questioned by Zurich's lawyers. He said all four members of Mr. Georgiou's committee directed his team to rescore the bidders.
Zurich, however, contends this was far more sinister. Mr. Georgiou "exploited his position ... to influence the direction of the evaluation," the company said in its pleadings.
If not for this change in scores, Bondfield "would not have been qualified."
‘WE ARE LOW ON ST. MIKES' As the deadline for the final bids crept closer, Mr. Aquino and Mr. Georgiou continued to exchange messages on the secret BlackBerry and Mr. Georgiou's bondfield.com e-mail account.
On May 18, 2014 - three days before the deadline - Mr. Georgiou advised Mr. Aquino to keep certain costs out of Bondfield's proposed price, explaining that he could "always fight later when we are No. 1."
That was not the only e-mail in which Mr. Georgiou used the word "we" to describe Bondfield. Pressed to explain his choice of words by Zurich's lawyers, Mr. Georgiou said that, in the event Bondfield did indeed win, the hospital would be "partners" with Mr. Aquino. "Using the word ‘we' loosely did not infer that ... I was on his team and I wanted him to win and not the others," he said.
After the bids were submitted, the details of each were supposed to be confidential. Yet, on May 30, just nine days after submitting his bid, Mr. Aquino e-mailed his brother and father to let them know Bondfield had the lowest price: "We are low on St. Mikes."
As for how that information filtered down to Mr. Aquino, Mr. Georgiou told Zurich's lawyers he had no explanation. Only Infrastructure Ontario knew those figures, and even he hadn't been told at that point, he said.
But sensitive and confidential bidding information continued to flow Mr. Aquino's way.
On July 23, 2014, the evaluators tasked with reviewing the design submissions of the bidders presented their scores to the steering committee of four senior officials, including Mr. Georgiou. Again, the scores were not favourable to Bondfield. The company had just eked out a passing grade. The evaluators gave the company a design score of 70.74 per cent - only a hair above the 70-per-cent threshold for disqualification.
This barely satisfactory score was not good enough for one of the Infrastructure Ontario officials on the steering committee. Derrick Toigo, then a senior vice-president with Infrastructure Ontario, refused to approve Bondfield's bid. Mr. Georgiou had a heated argument with Mr. Toigo, which one witness described as a "raised voice discussion."
Mr. Toigo's opposition had serious implications. Infrastructure Ontario's rules required the steering committee to be unanimous and his concerns meant the procurement could fail.
PCL had received a glowing design score of 86.22 per cent, but the high price tag it proposed - $538-million - ruled the company out entirely. EllisDon's design was considered non-compliant and it was disqualified.
That left only Bondfield, which bid $299million - 45 per cent lower than PCL. (Because the hospital had added scope to the project as the bidding process progressed, it had taken the unusual step of letting bidders know its target price was about $301-million.) But without Mr. Toigo's support, the contract couldn't be awarded.
Sure enough, the day after Mr. Georgiou's argument with Mr. Toigo, Mr. Aquino wrote detailed notes about the dispute in his notebook - right down to Bondfield's low design score. "Needs to be unanimous. Toigo voted against Bondfield design," Mr. Aquino wrote.
When asked by Zurich's lawyers how he had such detailed information about a confidential meeting only a day after the argument, Mr. Aquino said he couldn't recall precisely who told him. "I don't know if it was feedback I was getting from Vas ... or from my consultants."
To end the impasse, Infrastructure Ontario and St. Michael's took unprecedented steps, with the CEOs of both agencies exchanging emails and involving their boards. In the end, both agencies agreed to hire a third-party engineering consultant to review Bondfield's bid. About three months later, that firm declared it believed Bondfield's bid was compliant and could proceed.
THE WHISTLE IS BLOWN In 2015, not long after Bondfield broke ground at the hospital, brown envelopes containing identical letters appeared in the mailboxes of four Globe and Mail journalists.
The author of the letters, which were unsigned, urged the reporters to look into the many ties between Mr. Georgiou and Mr. Aquino, and the awarding of the St. Michael's contract.
Not long after, The Globe determined that, a year before Mr. Georgiou was hired at St. Michael's, he had been fired from Infrastructure Ontario after he was implicated in a fraud at Toronto's York University.
Court records showed that while he was a senior official at the procurement agency, he also controlled two construction companies that had issued invoices, totalling $65,000, to York for maintenance work. The problem was that neither company, both of which were owned by Mr. Georgiou's family, had actually performed any work.
Mr. Georgiou was never charged criminally, but York sued him to recover the funds - a suit that was settled out of court. He said he had never personally profited from the scheme, but acknowledged distributing part of the proceeds, in cash, to a friend who had asked him to issue the invoices.
When The Globe asked St. Michael's why it hired someone to oversee a $300-million procurement who had been embroiled in a fraud on a public university, the hospital had a simple answer: No one, including officials from Infrastructure Ontario, told it anything about this.
The Globe published a story on Sept. 15, 2015 about Mr. Georgiou's role in the fraud.
But the issues with him were much more extensive than $65,000 in false invoices.
After publishing its first piece, The Globe learned that, at the same time Mr. Georgiou had been evaluating bids for the St. Michael's project, he had also been working on the side for companies owned by Mr. Aquino.
Throughout the RFQ stage of the procurement - the phase that Bondfield barely survived, if not for the rescoring of the submissions - Mr. Georgiou was co-ordinating with Bondfield, readying two buildings, owned in part by Mr. Aquino, for new commercial tenants.
The next Globe story, published on Sept. 24, 2015, detailed this conflict of interest, and Mr. Georgiou's failure to disclose his ties to Mr. Aquino before the procurement.
On Nov. 12, 2015, St. Michael's fired Mr. Georgiou for cause. The letter it sent him cited his involvement in the false-invoice scheme, as well as his failure to disclose his work for Mr. Aquino's companies. And it issued him a stern warning: He was forbidden from using confidential information he had obtained during the procurement and from "providing services" to any company working on the hospital.
But the e-mails uncovered by Zurich show he was not deterred.
‘SOMETHING FOR SMOOTH' Mr. Georgiou insisted he had been railroaded, and launched a wrongful dismissal lawsuit against St. Michael's. But behind the scenes, emails show, he continued to act as an aide to Mr. Aquino - a whisperer who could help him navigate the politics of the hospital.
He resumed using his Bondfield e-mail address, bccldevelopment@bondfield.com, which had not come to light when he was fired, and was given a new BlackBerry by Mr. Aquino.
By 2016, the project was already falling into disarray. Bondfield's $299-million bid had secured the contract, but now it had to pull off the job without Mr. Georgiou in a position of influence.
The company was in big trouble. The project was a public-private partnership, which meant Bondfield paid for all of the construction through a credit facility funded by a syndicate of banks, led by the Bank of Montreal.
The company wouldn't receive anything from taxpayers until it hit its first milestone - the completion of the patient-care tower. Bondfield was burning through cash. Suppliers, upset about payment issues, stopped delivering products. Subcontractors were furious.
On March 14, 2016, Mr. Aquino sought an audience with the leadership of the hospital, and was coached by Mr. Georgiou on his approach. Mr. Georgiou advised Mr. Aquino to keep his temper - well known throughout Ontario's construction industry - in check.
"Do not get upset or angry," he wrote. "Speak Bay Street not Calabrese."
The two men also believed, the e-mails show, they still had a key asset safely in place within the hospital.
On Jan. 5, 2015, just a few weeks before St.
Michael's announced it had finally selected Bondfield as the winner, Mr. Georgiou appointed Michael Mendonca as the hospital's new vice-president of facilities. Mr. Mendonca, who also came to the hospital from Infrastructure Ontario, was to report to Mr. Georgiou and help oversee the project.
But the two men went back even further.
Under questioning by Zurich's lawyers, Mr. Georgiou confirmed they had been friends since high school. They were so close, in fact, that in many e-mails Mr. Georgiou referred to Mr. Mendonca by a nickname: "Smooth."
Despite his unceremonious exit, Mr. Georgiou acted as a sort of liaison between Mr. Aquino and Mr. Mendonca. He passed messages from Mr. Aquino to Mr. Mendonca, and vice versa, through 2017. He even attended a dinner with Mr. Aquino, Mr. Mendonca and Steven Muzzo, the owner of Ozz Electric, one of Bondfield's irate subcontractors, to try to mediate a resolution.
In 2017, more subcontractors walked off the job because of lack of payment. Mr. Aquino and Mr. Georgiou considered Mr. Mendonca their lifeline, internal Bondfield e-mails show.
On March 10, Mr. Aquino reached out to Mr. Georgiou when he heard from a Bondfield staffer that Mr. Mendonca was considering quitting: "Talk to Smooth. He is quitting?" Mr. Georgiou replied three hours later, saying he spoke with Mr. Mendonca, who he said had agreed to "hang in." He explained that Mr. Mendonca "felt trapped" because work on the project had come to a standstill, and that he was going to "get trashed" at the upcoming St.
Michael's board meeting.
Four months later, in July, Mr. Georgiou and Mr. Aquino were again concerned about Mr. Mendonca jumping ship. On July 27, Mr. Georgiou reached out to Mr. Aquino: "More importantly we need to connect on Mike and the BS going on down there and what we do to keep him."
The next day, Mr. Aquino replied: "I am worried about Smooth."
Mr. Mendonca declined to answer a list of questions from The Globe about why he continued to engage with Mr. Georgiou after he was fired. But in an e-mailed statement, he said he conducted himself "in a completely ethical and professional manner in all aspects."
As for why Mr. Georgiou continued to involve himself in the project, and assert his influence with Mr. Mendonca, Mr. Georgiou insists he received no financial compensation for doing so.
During his examination, he was asked by Zurich lawyer Brian Kolenda: "Sir, you had been fired from the hospital some 18 months prior to this. Why on earth would Mr. Mendonca, you and Mr. Aquino, for any legitimate purpose, need to be discussing St. Mike's at all?" Mr. Georgiou replied: "I wanted to make sure that the project was a success, regardless of my departure from St. Mike's." He said there was "nothing untoward" about his continued involvement.
But Zurich alleges other e-mails show Mr. Georgiou was indeed trying to obtain some kind of compensation for Mr. Mendonca.
In December, 2017, there were several emails about Mr. Mendonca. On Dec. 8, Mr. Georgiou e-mailed Mr. Aquino: "I told smooth to do whatever he can do to help you and we will work things out." Then, two days before Christmas, Mr. Georgiou e-mailed Mr. Aquino with a cryptic request: "Any chance to get something for Smooth today or tomorrow?" Mr. Aquino replied with a terse, two-word answer: "Boxing Day." Mr. Georgiou replied: "I will give him some more help tomorrow as he needs for xmas."
Asked by Zurich's lawyers what "help" he provided to Mr. Mendonca, Mr. Aquino said he believed he gave him a panettone, the Italian sweet bread that is popular at Christmas.
"So I think I gave him a panettone, and some wine, maybe a cognac bottle, that's about it.
But I didn't give any cash to Mike Mendonca."
Mr. Mendonca declined to explain what Mr. Georgiou was referring to when he asked Mr. Aquino to get "something" for him. However, in his e-mailed statement to The Globe he said he never received "cash or any other undisclosed payments from Mr. Aquino or anyone else."
The reason cash payments were being raised in Mr. Aquino's examination was because of an e-mail he sent to Mr. Georgiou in 2017.
On Feb. 14, 2017, the two men exchanged emails about a proposed casino development in Vancouver that one of Mr. Aquino's neighbours was involved in financing. Mr. Aquino told Mr. Georgiou: "Your (sic) going to get a bousta if can make this deal."
A bousta, or busta, is an Italian slang term often used to describe cash in an envelope.
Pressed by Zurich's lawyers, though, Mr. Georgiou said that's not at all what Mr. Aquino meant. He said "bousta" was reference to a commission that Mr. Georgiou would earn as an adviser on the casino deal.
‘NOT COMPROMISED' In the middle of all of this, after a 10-month investigation, a special committee of Infrastructure Ontario's board issued the results of its investigation into Mr. Georgiou and Mr. Aquino. The report touted the number of hours it spent interviewing witnesses (144) and the number of documents it reviewed (3,785) and made several sweeping conclusions.
In its summary of key findings, the special committee declared that the procurement was not compromised. What's more, it said its investigators - which consisted of a team from Toronto law firm Blake, Cassels & Graydon LLP and forensic auditors from Cohen Hamilton Steger & Co. Inc. - had found no evidence "of any attempt to inappropriately influence the procurement." Infrastructure Ontario paid Blakes $1.4-million for its work on the report.
For a number of people with inside knowledge about the procurement, the report's findings were puzzling. Several sources with knowledge of Mr. Georgiou's interventions at the RFQ and RFP stages - interventions that benefited Bondfield - who spoke with The Globe said they were simply never approached by the investigators. The Globe is not naming these sources because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the procurement.
Infrastructure Ontario continues to defend its conclusions.
In response to e-mailed questions from The Globe, Linda Robinson, the then-chair of Infrastructure Ontario's board and a former partner at Osler Hoskin & Harcourt LLP, said: "I am not going to comment on matters that were reviewed at great length and in painstaking detail by the legal and accounting firms five years ago."
Michael Lindsay, the new CEO of Infrastructure Ontario, said in an e-mailed statement that, because the agency selects winners by consensus as part of a committee, it is "virtually impossible for individuals to influence the outcome."
As for the investigators' failure to uncover the secret e-mails between Mr. Aquino and Mr. Georgiou, or the evidence of the home renovations and other alleged benefits, Mr. Lindsay chalked that up to the limitations of private investigators. "It must be recognized that neither the legal nor forensic accounting teams had the power to compel documents and testimony from unwilling parties."
This is not entirely accurate. Law firms that specialize in white-collar investigations often turn to the courts to compel the production of documents. They also sometimes obtain a court's permission to execute civil search warrants on residences and businesses - what is known as an Anton Piller order.
As for St. Michael's, the hospital settled its wrongful dismissal lawsuit with Mr. Georgiou.
The terms of the settlement are confidential, but the evidence unearthed by Zurich contains a hint about what Mr. Georgiou received.
Despite being terminated with cause - the result of which was supposed to be the full termination of all of his compensation - Mr. Georgiou received his full salary for another 18 months.
Pension documents provided by St. Michael's to Zurich show that Mr. Georgiou received his salary from Nov. 12, 2015 to May 12, 2017 - payments totalling $477,000.
Ms. Divell, the Unity Health spokeswoman, declined to comment on the payments to Mr. Georgiou.
In its statement, Unity Health characterized Zurich's lawsuit as an "attempt to get out of its obligations under the surety bonds," and noted that the health care network has countersued the insurer.
For its part, Zurich said, through its lawyer, that it disagreed with that assertion. "This litigation is about corruption in a publicly funded procurement process."
As for the project itself, St. Michael's has opened six floors of the new tower for patient care, as well as a COVID-19 vaccination clinic.
The top two floors remain under construction, Ms. Divell said.
"In the meantime, our focus will remain on what has been our priority for more than 130 years and what matters even more right now - caring for those who need us most during this unprecedented pandemic," she said.

Full text: Alberta's government-owned investment fund named veteran Crown corporation leader Evan Siddall as its new chief executive officer on Thursday, while announcing the $118-billion asset manager significantly underperformed its benchmark last year.
Mr. Siddall, former CEO of Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp., will take over Alberta Investment Management Corp., or AIMCo, on July 1. He replaces Kevin Uebelein, who has run AIMCo for the past six years. The Edmonton asset manager invests on behalf of 31 provincial pension, endowment and government funds, including the Heritage Savings Trust Fund.
Last spring, AIMCo lost $2.1-billion on investment strategies linked to market volatility. An inquiry commissioned by AIMCo's board of directors subsequently found failings in the fund manager's risk management systems, and a number of executives departed. On Thursday, the fund manager announced it earned a 2.5-per-cent overall return in 2020. AIMCo said that return was 5.4 percentage points below its performance benchmark of 7.9 per cent. "It was a tough year, however, the portfolio is well-positioned for the long term," AIMCo chair Mark Wiseman said in an interview on Thursday.
Mr. Wiseman said Mr. Siddall was the board's top choice as the next leader of AIMCo and brings a wealth of experience in financial markets and Crown corporations.
Mr. Siddall, 55, holds a law degree and was at the Bank of Canada prior to joining CMHC in 2013. He previously worked as an investment banker with Bank of Montreal and Goldman Sachs, and as a senior executive at Irving Oil Ltd.
"Evan's role is ultimately about serving AIMCo's clients, who have very different needs," said Mr. Wiseman, former CEO of Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. "Part of that role is to ensure the organization has flawless risk management, and is rewarded appropriately for the risks it does take."
Mr. Siddall said in a press release he is delighted to join AIMCo and is "looking forward to working with AIMCo's talented team of professionals in delivering consistently superior investment performance on behalf of our clients." He is expected to move to Edmonton this summer. At CMHC, Mr. Siddall was active on social media and outspoken on hot-button issues such as mortgage lending standards and housing prices.
AIMCo's current CEO, Mr. Uebelein, will depart on June 30.
In a press release on Thursday, he said last year's performance was "extremely humbling." He said AIMCo's public- and private-market portfolios are now performing well, and the fund is focusing new real estate investments on industrial and logistics properties, in the face of "challenged" outlooks for the office and retail sectors.
AIMCo's new CEO arrives as Alberta Premier Jason Kenney's government bulks up the fund manager by charging it with investing the $20-billion provincial teachers' pension plan, a shift the teachers' union is fighting in court. Mr. Kenney is also considering pulling the province's contributions out of Canada Pension Plan and managing the money in Alberta.
The Alberta government also embraced confrontation with unionized employees last year by imposing a new investment agreement on AIMCo's largest client, the $53-billion Local Authorities Pension Plan, a retirement fund for health care workers and government employees. In an interview on Thursday, LAPP chief executive Chris Brown said: "We have areas where we disagree, and we're optimistic on new leadership, and looking forward to a conversation with Mr. Siddall on how we can find alignment on our common interests."
In 2019, AIMCo's CEO earned $2.8-million, compensation that is on par with similar-sized domestic pension plans and competitive with private-sector money managers. The fund manager ran a global campaign for a new leader, led by executive search firm Heidrick & Struggles International.
Mr. Wiseman said AIMCo moved from an initial pool of 150 candidates to a short list of nine potential leaders before selecting Mr. Siddall. LAPP's Mr. Brown said his organization was pleased to see AIMCo "ran a transparent, robust process, that resulted in a new CEO with an impressive CV."

Climbing costs hammer high-rise construction

Full text: THE LISTING Construction costs in Canada are expected to soar in 2021, with Toronto leading the way thanks in part to booming prices for the materials and labour that go into high-rise buildings.
The 2021 forecast by real estate data and consultancy company Altus Group expects overall construction costs in the Greater Toronto Area to rise by 5 per cent, though the final increase could fall in a range of 3 per cent to 6 per cent. No other major city is expected to face rises as rapid, though Vancouver could see a 2per-cent to 4-per-cent increase to its already high construction costs.
"At the rate we're going it's going to be the highest cost increases [for high-rises] since 2018, when for high-rise projects costs increased 10 per cent in Toronto in one year. I don't think we'll get there, but we're going to be higher than at any other point since 2015," said David Schoonjans a senior director in Altus's Cost & Project Management group.
For 2021, Altus predicts costs for building high-rises in Vancouver will remain the highest in the country (between $340 and $360 per square foot on the high end for buildings between 12 and 60 storeys) with the Greater Toronto Area in second place (prices get a little lower, between $315 and $380 per square feet).
High-rise buildings in those two centres are on average $75 more per square foot than every other major metro area in the country. For example, Montreal is the next largest major metro area and its costs range between $250 and $270 per square feet on the high end.
The price differentials between Vancouver and Toronto and the rest of Canada persist in low-rise wood-frame construction as well, though all prices in this building category are cheaper by between $60 and $100 a square foot.
What's striking is that it costs the same per square foot to build a 12storey building in Calgary as it does to build a single-family detached home in Vancouver ($265 per square feet). Altus's data are based on its own consulting on 1,300 projects in 2020.
"Legacy things, prepandemic things, like demand pressures, are still there. Now we've added on top of it pandemic things," Mr. Schoonjans said. "It has disrupted global supply chains and made commodities very volatile. For developers, it's not good enough to know their total cost of their building is "X" per square feet; they need to go deeper and understand ‘Who are my trades?' If they are not down in the weeds, they could have some difficulties."
Andrew Pariser, vice-president with industry group RESCON (Residential Construction Council of Ontario), said some of the cost shocks were outside the typical big three inputs - wood, concrete and steel - such as a recent nationwide shortage in furnace and air-conditioning units. "Our supply chain is global and in the U.S., the Texas freeze has had a big impact as well," he said.
Daikin Industries Ltd. has a US$400-million manufacturing plant outside Houston that makes just about every Goodman, Daikin and Amana air conditioner sold in North America. It was shut down when the state's electrical grid collapsed during a February cold snap.
"What that triggers is ... the larger trades and builders think, ‘I better stockpile,' and they surge their typical orders," said Paul De Berardis, director of building science and innovation at RESCON.
The result was that heating and cooling units became even more scarce. Disruptions like these can rock a supply chain for months.
High demand for some building trades was already an issue before the pandemic. One of the main stress points has been formwork, a catch-all term that refers to the trades that are needed for concrete construction. Formwork costs can make up to 25 per cent of the total cost of building a high-rise, according to Mr. Schoonjans, and since 2015, formwork costs have doubled.
"Formwork probably has added on $15 to $20 a square foot, for the entire building cost," he said "That would equate to $17,000 per condo," to a roughly 800 square foot unit.
With formwork, Mr. Schoonjans said, "that supply problem isn't easily solved. "It's a very local industry; they are not big national companies. And the major part of their input is labour. You can't snap your fingers and have a new journeyman, today."
Added to which, the wholesale price of the plywood needed for concrete formwork has reached new highs - up 65 per cent since January, 2020, amid a wider lumber shortage that has impacted all builders.
"Pretty much any wood product - hardwood and softwood - all that stuff has gone up significantly. Any type of hardwood species - for stairs, flooring or trim - some of the increases have been astronomical, from 30 to 40 per cent to 200 to 300 per cent," Mr. De Berardis said.
Steel is needed for construction in everything from rebar for structural concrete to ductwork for HVAC systems and raw iron ore costs are up more than 60 per cent since early 2020, according to the World Bank. It found that rising demand for steel in China (which accounts for two-thirds of the world's seaborne ore trade) collided with production problems in major exporters such as Brazil. The World Bank predicted prices could come down 2 per cent throughout 2021, presuming Brazil's rampaging COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained.
And that points to another issue: Some of these shortages might be ameliorated, but the costs may stay high. "Costs can be rather sticky coming down," Mr. Schoonjans said. In 2018, a record number of condo projects in the GTA were cancelled because developers had sold their units years earlier, at prices that could not pay for increased costs.
Mr. Schoonjans says there's a concern that could happen again, but even more broadly, he wonders if these costs will be met with consumer resistance to everhigher prices for new condos.
"The industry has been saved by rapidly rising prices, but if cost increases begin to outpace the price increases ... that's the risk and challenge ahead," Mr. Schoonjans said. His concern is not just with the ability of builders to be profitable, but with being able to build anything. "You can't solve the housing crisis without building houses."

Full text: A local affiliate of Colliers International, the international property management company headquartered in Toronto, is a leasing agent for a high-end building in Myanmar built on land owned by an arm of the country's military.
The Sule Square complex is located on land owned by the Quartermaster General Office of the country's army (officially known as Tatmadaw), which is tasked with securing supplies for its forces - including, activists say, the bullets and artillery used to kill more than 700 civilians since the Feb. 1 coup.
Colliers, which operates in Myanmar through an affiliate, has maintained its interest in the property despite years of efforts by United Nations experts to push foreign companies to sever ties with a military that has a long history of killing its own people, including Rohingya Muslims and anti-coup demonstrators.
The Sule Square example also highlights gaps in Canada's sanctions toward Myanmar, which are narrowly written and do not specifically cover the office of the Quartermaster General, despite a fresh warning on Tuesday in an advisory from Global Affairs Canada that Ottawa "expects Canadian companies active abroad, in any market or country, to respect human rights, operate lawfully, conduct their activities in a responsible manner and adopt voluntary best practices and internationally respected guidelines."
The link between Sule Square and Tatmadaw has been public since 2019, with the publication of a report by the United Nations Human Rights Council's independent international fact-finding mission.
It describes "the Quartermaster General Office-owned land leased to the Sule Shangri-La Hotel and Sule Square commercial project."
The Quartermaster is "the clearing point" for procuring weapons and other supplies for the army, said Marzuki Darusman, the former attorney-general of Indonesia, who led the factfinding mission. Foreigners are not allowed to own real estate in Myanmar, with only a few exceptions. The terms of any lease agreements on Sule Square are not known. State media reports showed that the initial contract to develop the site was made directly with the Quartermaster General Office and the Ministry of Defence.
Leaked documents show that a different shopping and hotel plaza in Yangon generated roughly US$20-million a year in revenue for the military, said Chris Sidoti, an Australian human-rights lawyer who was an expert on the fact-finding mission and now serves with Mr. Darusman on the Special Advisory Council for Myanmar, an independent group of international experts working to support human rights in the country.
There are "probably hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign money flowing to military coffers because of business arrangements like this," he said. "It's funding the military's operations."
Shangri-La did not answer questions sent by e-mail. Colliers International distanced itself from its brand in Myanmar, which calls itself Colliers International but that the company says is run separately.
"Operations under the Colliers brand in Myanmar are carried out by an independent franchisee entity under its own management and direction," said Colliers global communications manager Andrea Cheung.
Colliers International Group "holds no direct or indirect ownership in such entity," she said, declining further comment, including on whether Colliers receives revenue from Myanmar.
"We are not in a position to discuss the terms and conditions of the agreement with the franchisee in Myanmar," she said.
Corporate records show that the affiliate is Colliers International Myanmar, or C.I.M. Property Consultants Co. Ltd. One of its directors, Edward Corcoran, is chief executive of Colliers International Thailand. He did not respond to a request for comment.
In 2019, Colliers affiliates provided the company with $500million in revenue, 14 per cent of its total. Colliers specifies that its code of ethics applies to both the company and its "owned affiliates." In an inaugural Global Impact Report released by Colliers on Monday, chief executive officer Jay Hennick promises to "align our business to maximize our positive impact."
Among the directors who sits on the Colliers board is former prime minister Stephen Harper, who boasted in 2009 that Canada had "imposed the toughest sanctions in the entire world" on Myanmar after it sentenced Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi to house arrest. In 2020, Colliers paid Mr. Harper US$338,150 in cash and stock options. He did not respond to a request for comment.
Marketing materials from Colliers say that Sule Square offers "panoramic views of the colourful city from an unparalleled location for both business and leisure." The complex boasts dozens of shops, a supermarket, five storeys of parking and more than 320,000 square feet of rentable office space. It is situated next to the Sule Shangri-La hotel in Yangon.
In March, the Canadian government said the primary objective of Canada's escalating sanctions against Myanmar is "to put pressure on the Tatmadaw to change its behaviour and reverse its actions." Those sanctions name 54 people and 44 entities.
But they do not include Tatmadaw itself, nor the Quartermaster General Office or the officer in charge of it. That makes it unlikely the sanctions cover a property such as Sule Square.
"There's a good argument that if the government had intended to impose sanctions against the Quartermaster General, they would have listed it," said John Boscariol, a lawyer who leads the international trade and investment law group at McCarthy Tétrault LLP.
Experts have called for a complete cut to business ties with Myanmar's military, regardless of the specifics of sanctions.
"We are aiming for a blanket termination of all transactions, which may end up with the Tatmadaw acquiring money from their investments with international corporations," Mr. Darusman said. It's an effort to squeeze funds available to the country's generals, but also to stoke division between them, in hopes of forcing the military to negotiate on who holds power in the country, he said.
Other major international companies have come under pressure to exit Myanmar. South Korean steelmaker Posco is now reviewing options that include selling its joint steel venture with Myanmar Economic Holdings Ltd, a military-owned firm, or taking full control of the project, Reuters reported earlier this month. On Monday, Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone was removed from the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices in part because of what S&P Dow Jones called "heightened risks to the company regarding their commercial relationship with Myanmar's military, who are alleged to have committed serious human rights abuses under international law."
Myanmar's ousted civilian government has called for international oil companies, including Petronas, PTTEP and Total, to freeze payments to the military.
Total chief executive officer Patrick Pouyanné has resisted those calls, saying the company will continue producing gas and paying taxes in order to maintain electrical generation in the country and keep its staff from being forced into labour.
Human-rights advocates have called on Ottawa, meanwhile, to more rigorously apply and police its sanctions.
"Canadian sanctions should prevent companies like Colliers carrying out business linked to the Myanmar military," said Yadanar Maung, the assumed name used by a spokesperson for Justice for Myanmar, a group of activists who work anonymously to protect their safety.
"The Canadian government must take all action at its disposal to stop Canadian complicity in atrocity crimes in Myanmar."
In a statement, Global Affairs Canada spokesman Michel Cimpaye said: "Contravening Canadian sanctions is a criminal offence. All persons in Canada and Canadians abroad must comply with Canada's strict sanctions measures."
He added that "possible violations and offences involving Canada's sanctions are investigated and enforced" by the Canada Border Services Agency and the RCMP.
But Canada does not have a robust enforcement record, said Michael Nesbitt, a researcher and associate professor at the University of Calgary's Faculty of Law.
"There has never been a sanctions prosecution related to violations of the Myanmar Regulations," he said.
Since 1992, Canadian authorities have mounted only two attempted prosecutions under Canadian sanctions legislation, the Special Economic Measures Act, "despite much public evidence to suggest violations are happening out of Canada," Prof.
Nesbitt said.

Full text: An Indigenous fund first announced in the 2019 federal budget expects to start steering loans to businesses by the end of the year, backed by additional government contributions that bring the fund's first close to $150-million.
The Indigenous Growth Fund, announced as a $100-million initiative in 2019, will be managed by the National Aboriginal Capital Corporations Association, an umbrella group for lending agencies known as Aboriginal Financial Institutions, or AFIs.
Over the past three decades, those federally funded AFIs have provided nearly 50,000 loans worth close to $3-billion. But that figure could have been higher - and more businesses and communities would have benefited as a result - if the AFIs had more capital to manage, said NACCA chief executive officer Shannin Metatawabin. "Every year, our [AFI] clients are saying no to opportunities because they don't have any capital - they're waiting for capital to be repaid before they can issue a new loan," Mr. Metatawabin said in a recent interview.
The AFI network, made up of more than 50 groups across the country, currently lends about $125-million each year.
The fund's close, to be announced Wednesday, combines the $100-million announced in 2019 (which included $50-million from the Business Development Bank of Canada, or BDC, and $50million in other federal funding) with $50-million in new contributions from Export Development Canada and Farm Credit Canada.
The fund is designed to be "evergreen" - that is, open-ended without a set closing date - and to allow private investors to participate.
Funds will be distributed to AFIs, which are expected to make loans based on local contacts and experience.
"We decided to enter into this partnership with NACCA because it was a way for us to get much better reach into the community of Indigenous entrepreneurs across the country than we would be able to do on our own," said Michael Denham, CEO of BDC.
The fund is designed to address what has long been recognized as one of the biggest barriers for First Nations, Inuit and Métis entrepreneurs: access to capital.
Would-be Indigenous borrowers may lack a credit history or collateral, reflecting regulatory and systemic barriers. (In general, onreserve property is held collectively, limiting residents' ability to borrow against homes or other real estate.) "The door is pretty much closed on [conventional bank financing]," said Sunshine Tenasco, the founder of Her Braids, a jewellery and design business, and CEO of Pow Wow Pitch, a group that provides financial prizes to Indigenous entrepreneurs.
"For women who live, especially in community, on reserve, there's no collateral - you're already seen as high risk. Add to that the fact that you're a woman, add children in the mix ... all those things in the mix, they [banks] just won't take that chance on you," Ms. Tenasco said.
Through AFIs, the new fund is expected to provide loans in the $25,000 to $1-million range. Currently, the average loan size across the network is about $100,000 and there's a need to bridge the gap between small loans and the $1-million threshold, when entities become more "bankable," said NACCA's Frank Richter, managing director for the Indigenous Growth Fund.
Trent Fequet, president and CEO of Calgary-based Steel River Group, a management group for Indigenous-led businesses, welcomed the idea of an Indigenousfocused fund.
"It's another way to allow Indigenous entrepreneurs to access some funding - and that's phenomenal," Mr. Fequet said, adding that he still sees a funding gap for larger businesses. "I think maybe the next wave for government is to look at larger businesses, and whether there's an opportunity to look at ways to support them a little better."

Full text: At a time when most golfers are pulling their clubs out of storage, members of Beacon Hall Golf Club are fielding a new, $260million offer for their Torontoarea property, the latest in a series of development proposals pitched at urban golf courses.
Harlo Capital, a Toronto-based real estate private-equity fund, bid for the 200-acre Beacon Hall property a week ago, according to an e-mail that the club's board sent mid-week to its 260 members. The offer was made less than a month after members narrowly turned down a $250million sale to developer Treasure Hill Homes. At the time, Golf Canada chief executive Laurence Applebaum said the decision made for "a good day for golf in this country."
The flurry of activity at Beacon Hall, consistently ranked among the top 10 courses in Canada, reflects a residential real estate boom that sees frequent bidding wars among home buyers, and a Toronto market that saw the average price on a detached house soar 23 per cent over the past 12 months, to $1,371,791.
Harlo's bid plays on the psychology of potential sellers: The club is owned by its members, and values their stakes at $1-million each.
Beacon Hall, which opened in 1988, draws heavily from the Bay Street financial community. Memberships cost $40,000 and $80,000, depending on when they were purchased, so the sale of the club represented a potential lotterysized payday. The club's board has been fielding buyout offers for more than two years, and the debate over the property's future now splits the membership.
Last month, Beacon Hall's members voted 63 per cent in favour of selling the property, in Aurora, Ont., to Treasure Hill. The club's rules require that twothirds of members approve its sale, so the offer was turned down after falling eight votes short of approval.
In a letter of intent, rather than a binding contract, Harlo offered to pay $110-million down. It then asked Beacon Hall members to accept a note for a $150million mortgage that would initially pay 1.5-per-cent interest, and rise over time to 3 per cent. Harlo is pitching members on collecting interest payments that could potentially cover the cost of their annual golf fees. They could continue to play for the three to five years it is expected to take the developer to obtain the necessary permits.
In its e-mail to members, the Beacon Hall board said it would evaluate the offer and come back with a recommendation. Harlo and Beacon Hall executives declined to comment on the proposal.
Harlo has been involved in a number of condominium projects in Toronto, Hamilton and Kitchener, and has ties to other major real estate players. Harlo chief executive Jeffrey Kimel previously worked at privately owned Westdale Properties, one of the country's largest residential developers.
Three real estate industry sources said Harlo is expected to strike a partnership to develop Beacon Hall, or flip the property, if it is able to acquire the golf course. The Globe and Mail is not identifying these sources because they are not authorized to speak for Harlo or Beacon Hall.
Aurora Mayor Tom Mrakas has consistently opposed plans to redevelop Beacon Hall, but has also said that the municipality cannot block a sale. When members turned down the Treasure Hill offer in March, Mr. Mrakas said: "This is welcome news as Aurora retains this world-class golf course and the valuable green space that our community cherishes."
Across Canada, a number of urban golf courses have been turned into neighbourhoods. However, these plans typically kick off battles that pit golfers and local residents against developers.
The most recent statistics from Golf Canada, the sport's national governing body, said 51 courses shut down between 2015 and 2018, including 19 in Ontario. In the same period, 22 new courses were either launched or under construction.

Full text: Chances are you've never heard of Sayan Navaratnam. For many years, he's operated dull, privately held companies in unglamorous industries: hydraulic systems, IT staffing, call centres. They fall under the umbrella of Mr. Navaratnam's Malar Group Inc., which he describes in epic terms. "We are a leadership team like no other," he's quoted as saying on the company's website.
One of Mr. Navaratnam's companies recently joined the echelon of multibillion-dollar Canadian tech startups: Facedrive Inc. After it started trading on the Venture Exchange in September, 2019, its shares soared more than 2,800 per cent to a high in February, and its market cap topped $5-billion, making it more valuable than SNC-Lavalin, CI Financial and Maple Leaf Foods at the time. Mr. Navaratnam became a paper billionaire, owing to his roughly one-third stake.
Facedrive is no mere company, according to its press material. It's a "multifaceted ‘people-andplanet first' tech ecosystem." It operates a bewildering array of businesses: ride-sharing, electricvehicle subscriptions, food and grocery delivery, COVID-19 contact tracing and online retail.
It's in the Will Smith business, too, having invested US$1-million in a "content creation" company cofounded by the actor. (The firm, Westbrook, did not respond to emails.)
Mr. Navaratnam, who is CEO and chair, has attracted prominent supporters. Former Liberal MP Paul Zed is a director, and Phil Fontaine, former national chief of the Assembly of First Nations, is an adviser. In February, the Ontario government announced $2.5million in funding for Facedrive's contact-tracing technology. "We look deep into anything that we invest in," Premier Doug Ford said at a press conference when asked about the funding.
But take even a cursory look at Facedrive, and it's hard not to be mystified at the valuation. It's a small company with scant revenue. In the first nine months of 2020, it earned just $747,976 in sales and lost $14.4-million. Because its operations are so minimal, the company funds itself through equity financing.
It has no high-profile venture capital backing, and no analyst coverage.
Headquartered in Richmond Hill, Ont., Facedrive is adept at self-promotion, however. Seemingly no development is unworthy of publicity.
A mention in The Globe and Mail last year spawned two press releases. A website called OilPrice.com published dozens of articles about Facedrive and hailed Mr. Navaratnam, 46, as a visionary shaping the future of transportation alongside Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos. Disclaimers on the site note the owner of OilPrice.com holds a "considerable" number of Facedrive shares.
For all the accolades, Mr. Navaratnam is not eager to talk. A spokesperson said the company does not normally grant interviews and sent statements to The Globe through Mujir Muneeruddin, its chief legal officer. He declined to address many questions about Facedrive. Instead, he accused The Globe of racist bullying for inquiring about Mr. Navaratnam's biography and alleged its reporters were being manipulated by short-sellers betting on the stock's decline.
But Mr. Navaratnam is no neophyte, having worked at a hedge fund and serving as a CEO and director of public companies. Two of his past ventures also operated in trendy sectors, were heavily promoted and saw huge gains in their stock prices - only to crash to earth.
So far, Facedrive has followed the same pattern. The stock price has even fallen 60 per cent from its February peak. It's still a $2.3billion company, however - one that touts its revolutionary potential, even as it loses money. Its ascent in the market, even during frothy times for tech stocks, is an anomaly. And it's a company whose biggest shareholders are battling in court over hundreds of millions of dollars. Where the firm goes from here is anyone's guess. But the biggest mystery of all is just why Facedrive is a multibillion-dollar company in the first place.
In 2016, Uber and Lyft were already locking up the ride-sharing market. But Imran Khan and Junaid Razvi thought there was room for another player, and hatched the idea for Facedrive.
Passengers could select hybrid or electric vehicles, and a portion of their fares would be set aside for tree-planting. The company's contributions allowed more than 5,200 trees to be planted, according to Forests Ontario, an environmental organization. Over all, Facedrive has focused on environmental, social and governance (ESG) initiatives, also donating money to fight child marriage in Bangladesh.
More than a year passed before Facedrive secured a licence to operate in Toronto and another year went by before it started operating in the city. A few months prior to launch in 2018, Mr. Navaratnam's firm invested in Facedrive after being approached by Mr. Khan, a real estate agent. In a press release, Mr. Navaratnam declared Facedrive would "quickly become the technology of choice."
In 2019, Facedrive went public on the Venture Exchange through a reverse takeover, with Mr. Navaratnam as CEO, chairman and largest shareholder. Mr. Khan appeared to have no operational role, according to the filings, though he remains the second largest shareholder.
Mr. Navaratnam was already a wealthy man before Facedrive. He owns a mansion north of Toronto with a tennis court, and a suite at the Shangri-La, a luxury hotel condominium in the city's downtown. He commands a fleet of high-end cars that includes three Lamborghinis, a Tesla and a Bugatti Chiron Sport, which sells for about US$3.3-million. He wasn't always rich. He spent his adolescent years in a middle-class neighbourhood in Scarborough. In his 20s, he worked at a technology company called Satellite Communications Inc. His talent stood out and he was fast-tracked to CEO, said Cindy Farrell, a former managing director. "His focus was astounding, and always on the business, not on himself," she wrote in an e-mail.
Ms. Farrell's father founded the company, and after he died following a long illness, the family sold. She credits Mr. Navaratnam for maintaining the company in her father's absence. "It was astonishing that such a young person was so adept in business," she wrote.
He later worked at other tech firms, usually in the security space and areas related to telecom, and became a partner at a hedge fund before his current role at Facedrive. Not long after the company went public in 2019, the share price skyrocketed. Between January and July, 2020, it grew 960 per cent. A Facedrive investor presentation in March, 2020, outlined how its environmental ethos and brand partnerships (including with Will Smith) would help build the "ride-sharing platform of the future." The company said at the time it had signed up more than 13,000 drivers.
Available data from cities where Facedrive has said it operates show it has a fraction of that amount. Figures supplied by Toronto, London and Hamilton show Facedrive has 1,119 registered drivers. Orillia would only confirm Facedrive has fewer than 26 drivers in town. (Ottawa and Guelph did not provide exact figures.) Facedrive has said in the past it operates in Kitchener, Waterloo and Cambridge, but a spokesperson for the Region of Waterloo said it does not currently have a licence. A lack of drivers is evident when trying to book a ride. In Toronto, wait times were typically between 10 and 20 minutes, and few cars were available whenever a Globe reporter checked multiple times over the past few weeks. While Facedrive touts its dedication to the environment, there were zero electric vehicles available, and hybrids were rare.
After Facedrive launched last year in Orillia, a small city north of Toronto, Larry Radzio signed up as a driver. After he registered, he flipped on the app, and waited. "I sat there for a few hours, and I wouldn't get anything," he said.
Mr. Radzio estimates he's completed fewer than 10 rides with Facedrive during that time. Some of the trips were scheduled by riders in advance. Ride-sharing brought in more than half the company's revenue during the first nine months of 2020. (It has yet to file year-end results.)
According to Mr. Muneeruddin, the chief legal officer, the pandemic hurt demand for ridesharing. "This, in turn, had a number of knock-on effects including pausing the company's planned expansions into new cities, delays in renewals of Facedrive's licences at the municipal level, and a reduction in registered and active drivers," he wrote.
Even before COVID-19, the business was small: revenue from rides, after paying out drivers, totalled $349,104 in 2019. The company's valuation was seemingly immune to any pandemic-induced slowdown, and Facedrive ended 2020 worth $1.5-billion.
But for Mr. Navaratnam, inflated valuations and wild stock price swings are nothing new.
In 2004, Mr. Navaratnam got into business with a New York hedge fund called Laurus Capital Management LLC. The fund was run by brothers Eugene and David Grin, who filled a niche by lending money to companies that traded for pennies on over-the-counter exchanges. That year, the Grins and Mr. Navaratnam took a security technology firm of his public through a shell company called Creative Vistas. The company emphasized security spending had ballooned since the terrorist attacks of September 11. "It's no secret that the homeland security sector is an explosive market," reads an article the company paid for on a now-defunct stock promotion site.
Creative Vistas made a few acquisitions, the largest of which was Cancable, a provider of installation services primarily for Rogers Communications Inc. In the summer of 2006, Mr. Navaratnam wrote in a letter to shareholders the company was about to launch an "aggressive" investor relations strategy. Its shares, which traded for pennies, exploded more than 500 per cent between January and August, 2007.
While the stock was booming, the company was losing money and in debt to Laurus for nearly US$16-million. Revenue was growing (sales totalled nearly US$40-million in 2007) but its auditors had concerns about recurring losses: "These factors raise substantial doubt about the company's ability to continue as a going concern," the auditors wrote in the 2007 annual report.
The shares crashed the next year, even before the global financial crisis hit that fall. By June, the share price had fallen nearly 70 per cent. Mr. Navaratnam, who served as chair, and Laurus appear to have held on to the majority of their stakes throughout the boom and bust.
In 2011, Creative Vistas sold its largest division, Cancable, to an affiliate of Laurus for one dollar.
Shares had already collapsed 99 per cent from the peak in 2007.
By then, Mr. Navaratnam was working directly for Laurus as a partner, senior managing director and member of the management committee. That relationship led him to another penny stock in a hot sector, the nascent biofuels industry. The stock was PetroAlgae Inc., a Florida-based company that said it was close to achieving the first large-scale commerciali-
zation of a technology capable of extracting fuel from algae. The company warned that short-term profits might be elusive, but in the long run, it hoped to licence its technology around the world, allowing anyone to operate their own algae, micro-crop farm.
Laurus took PetroAlgae public through a reverse takeover in 2008, and Mr. Navaratnam was appointed to the board. PetroAlgae then tapped one of his companies for consulting services, paying in shares valued at US$3.15-million at the time, according to public filings. Within PetroAlgae, Mr. Navaratnam was seen as Laurus's eyes and ears. He brought much needed discipline, according to a former executive with the company.
But that discipline did not translate into sales. Despite signing multiple memorandums of understanding with potential partners in China and India, the company never reported any revenue and turned in huge losses - including US$30-million in 2009 - all while racking up debt to Laurus. The former PetroAlgae executive said Mr. Navaratnam and Laurus remained committed, even though evidence showed the company was far from profitability. (The Globe is not naming the source because he is not authorized to discuss PetroAlgae publicly.)
If PetroAlgae's stock price is any indication, some investors were believers, too. The stock hit a high of $26.75, making the company worth nearly US$2.7-billion.
It's unclear what caused the spike; PetroAlgae attributed the swings to low trading volume.
Regulatory filings show no sign the Grin brothers or Mr. Navaratnam sold their stock. In the end, the technology never took off. By the end of 2012, the stock price had plummeted to 85 cents and PetroAlgae took on a new name and mission. The company that set out to upend the fuel industry now sells protein powder made from water lentils.
Mr. Navaratnam's eclectic approach to business - security, telecom, algae - is readily apparent at Facedrive. After the pandemic hit in March, 2020, the company shifted gears from ride-sharing and announced it was developing a COVID-19 contact-tracing technology with the University of Waterloo. Dubbed TraceSCAN, the wearable tech uses Bluetooth connections to log contacts and vibrates or beeps if users aren't distancing. It's supposed to supplement the federal government's COVID-19 Alert app in settings where smartphone use is limited or not permitted, such as construction sites.
According to the company's press releases, Waterloo professors Patricia Nieva and William Melek led a team that implemented artificial intelligence to identify a wide network of potential contacts after a positive case. Both professors were quoted in multiple press releases and appeared in a video, but neither returned emails and calls from The Globe.
Facedrive quickly found supporters. The Labourers' International Union of North America (LiUNA), which has 130,000 members in Canada, announced it would adopt TraceSCAN, run a pilot project at a construction site, and then endorsed the device for use across its work sites. The test happened not on a construction site, but at a LiUNA training facility with 25 participants over a few weeks. "We wanted to ensure we ran the initial pilot project in a controlled setting to closely monitor the effectiveness and functionality of the technology," said spokesperson Victoria Mancinelli in an e-mail. "The pilot project was a great success." She did not answer a question about how the results were assessed, nor is she aware of any construction sites using TraceSCAN today.
Facedrive also made in-roads with the Ontario government. After a briefing with officials last year, Monte McNaughton, the Minister of Labour, Training and Skills Development, wrote a supportive letter to Facedrive. Then the company issued a press release, stating the government "endorsed and supports the deployment" of TraceSCAN. The letter, obtained by The Globe, was more circumspect, noting that the technology could fill a gap and encouraged the company to advance TraceSCAN.
Mr. McNaughton also referenced a TraceSCAN "pilot project with LiUNA and their over 200 members with EllisDon currently working on the Parliament Hill renovations in Ottawa," noting the government would monitor it "with great interest." His statement was news to EllisDon. A spokesperson for the construction giant said TraceSCAN was not used on-site, and the Ottawa office is "completely unaware of the software."
Still, TraceSCAN was seen by the government to be promising enough to receive $2.5-million in February through a fund to support businesses developing technology to combat COVID-19. A promotional video tweeted by Economic Development Minister Victor Fedeli said the funding would enable Facedrive to manufacture 150,000 devices "right here in Ontario."
What exactly the company will build in the province is not clear.
Facedrive told The Globe it sources the hardware for TraceSCAN in China and the U.S. There are similar products for sale in bulk from Chinese manufacturers through Alibaba.com. One company, called KKM, sells contact tracing wearables that appear identical to both versions of TraceSCAN, right down to a small fingerprint decal on one variety. KKM can customize the hardware for buyers by applying logos, and provides a software kit to integrate with other applications. In bulk, they cost a few dollars each.
An instruction page that comes with TraceSCAN is identical to one in KKM's manual. Further, records show Facedrive certified nine wireless devices with Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada, seven of which have model numbers that are the same as KKM's wearables.
"The Globe's suggestion that Facedrive is simply selling wearable bands readily available on Alibaba is not the case," the company said. In a letter to The Globe, Facedrive said the value of TraceSCAN is its proprietary software.
The company has also customized the technology, it said, such as by adding a feature to "pinpoint locations of potential COVID-19 contamination."
TraceSCAN is used in a few places. Air Canada has tested the technology over the past few months. "We are still analyzing the data," a spokesperson said, "but the employee response was very positive."
Riverside Natural Foods deployed TraceSCAN to its 400 employees across its facilities in Toronto. "They've been very co-operative from the onset in terms of the software updates and the modifications we needed," president Nima Fotovat said of Facedrive. "And I love the fact that they're local."
It's not just businesses, either.
Waywayseecappo, a First Nations community of about 2,800 people in Manitoba, is also deploying TraceSCAN. Chief Murray Clearsky said the community was introduced to Facedrive through Mr. Fontaine, and agreed to run a pilot project in December before adopting the technology more widely. Between 300 and 350 devices have been issued so far in the community, which has seen 13 cases of COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic. While Facedrive said in January the pilot was completed, Mr. Clearsky said more evaluation was under way. "If it works, then we pay. If it doesn't, then we don't," he said. So far, the response from the community has been positive and other First Nations have called Mr. Clearsky to ask about the devices.
A few days after Waywayseecappo said it would adopt TraceSCAN, Facedrive closed an investment round that included participation from members of a First Nations community, according to a press release. Mr. Clearsky could not say whether Waywayseecappo invested until he talked to the community's financial advisers.
"They give us a total breakdown of where they invested our money," he said, "but I think it was two, three weeks ago that I said, ‘Yeah, you should.' " Others are not convinced Facedrive is a sound investment. In July, short-seller Hindenburg Research published a report calling Facedrive a "stock promotion with a hollow core." Of note was an agreement Facedrive signed with an obscure company called Medtronics Online Solutions Ltd.
for "marketing and strategic consulting services." Facedrive paid in shares valued at $8.2-million, which, at the time, was more than the company's operating expenditures over the previous year.
Hindenburg found Medtronics was linked to OilPrice.com, the site that published many glowing paid articles about Facedrive.
Facedrive chief legal officer Mr. Muneeruddin wrote to The Globe that "Facedrive has come under attack" from hedge funds "seeking to burn Facedrive's business to the ground and profit from the ashes." He suggested that because of the strength of the company's share price, hedge funds selling short cannot exit without suffering losses.
"Given Facedrive's current stock prices, the short sellers could not possibly cover the short, and therefore have put themselves in an existential battle with Facedrive," he wrote.
Most of the company's shares - nearly 86 million, according to its most recent financials - are under contractual lock-up restrictions, meaning they cannot be sold.
Lockup agreements are commonplace when a company goes public, ensuring that insiders stay committed to building shareholder wealth long-term, rather than making a quick exit. A company can better maintain its valuation, too; if insiders unload significant stakes, it could depress the stock price.
Since Facedrive went public, it has taken steps to continue to keep insiders locked up, according to allegations made in court documents. One of those insiders was Nauman Kureshy, who says he was provided with shares as a reward for, among other things, introducing Facedrive co-founder Imran Khan to Mr. Navaratnam.
When the company went public in 2019, Mr. Kureshy alleges, he was pressured to sign a lock-up agreement, and Mr. Navaratnam and two other executives "threatened" they wouldn't register his shares at all if he didn't sign. Mr. Kureshy refused, arguing Facedrive had no legal basis for doing so. He alleges the company responded by refusing to register his shares with the company responsible for officially recording Facedrive's security holders. Mr. Kureshy is suing Facedrive and its executive team for $1.6-million, the value of his stake when he launched his lawsuit in 2020.
Facedrive declined to comment on Mr. Kureshy's allegations, but said they are "actively being defended in court."
Facedrive is also manoeuvring to force co-founder Mr. Khan, who no longer has a role, to disgorge his 25-per-cent ownership stake and have it placed in a trust. On March 29, two days before Mr. Khan's lockup restrictions were to start expiring, Mr. Navaratnam filed a lawsuit that alleges Mr. Khan misled him to secure his initial investment in Facedrive. Mr. Navaratnam claims he was led to believe the company's ride-sharing software was "cutting edge" and built by the creator and lead developer of Skype. Only after investing in 2018, he alleges, did he learn the software was plagued with problems and required substantial funding. Facedrive had been "near collapse," with few drivers and no revenue.
The suit also claims Mr. Khan breached the terms of his lock-up agreement by pledging his Facedrive shares in exchange for loans for a real estate development. "It would be unconscionable to allow Imran to profit from Facedrive's success as he had no role in it," according to the claim.
Mr. Navaratnam is not only seeking $12-million in damages, but the value of Mr. Khan's shares - about $503-million.
In an e-mailed statement to The Globe, Mr. Khan said that he had yet to be served with the claim, and that he believes it was drafted to cast untrue aspersions about him with other shareholders. He said the claim "is without any factual or legal merit."
Mr. Navaratnam's own lockup provisions were set to start expiring in March, too. On March 8, however, Mr. Navaratnam extended the period for two years, while two other executives extended for an additional year. "As the initial lock-up period came to an end, we felt it was necessary to assure the market that we had no plans to sell our shares and that we are all in this for the long term," Mr. Navaratnam said in a press release. (A day later, Medtronics put out its own release announcing a one-year lock-up extension for its shares.)
For Mr. Navaratnam to cash in on his substantial stake, worth about $714-million, Facedrive has to maintain its valuation. The question is how. TraceSCAN faces challenges now that Canadians are getting vaccinated, though the company said it can expand into "digital passports." Ridesharing retrenched during the pandemic. Facedrive runs an online marketplace selling tech gadgets and accessories, but it earned just $8,597 in revenue the first three quarters of 2020.
The company bought an electric vehicle subscription service called Steer last September, but it's just getting started. Steer was only available in Washington, D.C., at the time of the purchase, and expanded to a second city, Toronto, in March.
The company started developing its own food delivery app, but ended up purchasing a small Toronto company called Food Hwy.
Facedrive said it expects Food Hwy to bring in $10.5-million in revenue in 2020, and once combined with its own food delivery business, $30-million this year.
(Before the acquisition, Facedrive made just $1,953 through its own service.) The company itself has no doubts about its prospects.
"Facedrive is highly confident in and committed to its business model and believes increases in its market valuation reflects that same investor confidence," Mr. Muneeruddin wrote to The Globe.
He himself is committed, too. "I truly believe Facedrive is going to change the world," he wrote.
Tonya Flouro-Catlin, who lives in the U.S., is also among the faithful. Part of a small Facebook group for retail Facedrive investors, she owns just a few shares. "I know it's not a lot," she wrote in an e-mail last month. "But it is to me, especially on a fixed income." She had been researching stocks when she came across Facedrive, and was struck by the company's mission.
She had a good feeling about it, and told others about it, too. "I feel that this company has huge potential to really expand ... and could be [the] next Amazon," she wrote. "I truly believe in this company."

Full text: 51 Barker Ave.
TORONTO Asking Price: $899,000 Taxes: $3,358.34 (2020) Lot Size: 25 feet by 134 feet Agent: Chris Neill, The Weir Team Brokerage Inc.
THE BACK STORY Tiffany Vogel was three years old when her mother, Trudy Vogel, purchased a tiny bungalow in East York for the two of them.
The year was 1987 and bidding wars were becoming increasingly heated in the Toronto real estate market.
"I know when we first bought the house, Mom had missed out on a few," Ms. Vogel says. "She felt very lucky."
The local library still has vintage photos of 51 Barker Ave., which was originally built as a cottage. Gradually the neighbourhood grew up around it, with postwar bungalows lining the street.
Money was tight over the years and, at times, Ms. Vogel says, her mother wondered if she would need to sell the house to pay for her daughter's education.
"We were very house poor and many times considered selling to make ends meet," Ms. Vogel recalls.
The thought of her mother giving up their treasured home motivated Ms. Vogel to achieve high marks in an effort to fund her postsecondary schooling. She went on to study at Oxford University on a full scholarship. After graduation, Ms. Vogel launched her career and rose to the level of partner at the global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company.
During her time away, Ms. Vogel always had a notion that she would like to return to Toronto and settle into her childhood home.
In 2017, she made the move back to Barker Avenue and decided to freshen up some of the dated colours and materials.
With only 560 square feet on the main floor, she didn't see the potential to do much more.
"I would describe the initial project as a facelift," Ms. Vogel says.
A long-time friend, interior designer Enid MacIntosh of Great Interiors, agreed to help her choose some paint colours and other details.
Ms. Vogel was on a ladder poking into the ceiling when the two realized that the beams and trusses above would allow them to open up the space to a dramatic vaulted ceiling.
"You can live large if you plan it properly," Ms. MacIntosh says. "When you go up, you essentially visually double the size of the space."
From there, the project turned into a major renovation that would transform the bungalow from top to bottom.
"It evolved," says Ms. MacIntosh, to laughter from Ms. Vogel.
THE HOUSE TODAY Ms. MacIntosh has designed residential and commercial interiors in Toronto, Los Angeles, Miami and Tel Aviv.
Her work has included creating interiors for homes of 10,000 square feet and developing compact model suites for developers.
"I'm always up for a design challenge," Ms. MacIntosh says. "I work big and small."
On Barker Avenue, she suggested reconfiguring the main floor with a new kitchen, dining area and living room.
The open plan places the area for lounging and relaxing at the front of the house. A new window overlooks the front porch and street.
Throughout the house, window openings were lined up to create a consistent appearance, Ms. MacIntosh says.
Strategically placed lighting - including track lighting along the beam - illuminates art and collectibles. The LED lighting also allows Ms. Vogel to adjust the mood with dimmer switches. "Light can make or break a space. I like to see moments where you're creating focus," the designer says.
The kitchen has sleek white cabinets, a chef's range and an island.
The dining area's bench and table fit the space perfectly, says Ms. MacIntosh, who designed the table so that it can be lowered when people are seated or raised to almost counter height. "The space changes if you need it to," she says.
The back wall is painted dark grey in order to define the space. A ladder provides access to a loft above, which Ms. Vogel says could be turned into a reading nook or a tiny guest bedroom with the addition of a rail for safety.
A door leads to a bedroom at the rear of the main level. Doors open to a Juliette balcony overlooking the backyard. The designer borrowed space from the kitchen to create an ensuite bathroom.
Ms. MacIntosh had a bench and hidden storage built into the walk-in shower. The designer found clever uses for any leftover space.
"We converted the chimney into a dream shoe closet," Ms. Vogel says.
Downstairs, a complete overhaul created more living space.
"The basement was just a warren of small rooms," Ms. MacIntosh says.
The team decided to underpin and waterproof the basement. They reconfigured the space to create a lounge, a second bedroom and a bathroom with natural light from a window. There's also a kitchenette on that level.
The completed house has a tight colour palette of grey and white and other neutrals so that the flow continues throughout.
"I think it's an artful space," Ms. MacIntosh says.
While the renovation was still under way, Ms. Vogel's plans took a turn and she met her husband. She now lives in California.
Trudy Vogel, meanwhile, has decided to spend her retirement outside of Toronto.
The mother and daughter decided to list the house for sale.
Earlier this month, real estate agent Chris Neill of The Weir Team listed the property with an asking price of $899,000.
After five days on the market, the Vogels received nine offers and the house sold for $1.38-million.
Ms. Vogel says she's disappointed that she did not have a chance to spend much time in the newly renovated home, but she hopes that it will stand for a long time. The large backyard would accommodate an addition on the rear, she points out.
She still recalls the first time she visited the home with her mom.
"We lay on the floor together and looked up at the ceiling. That's what we plan to do when we say goodbye."
THE BEST FEATURE The living area has a wall of custom-built bookshelves with shelves above and a library ladder which slides on a rail.
"A huge feature wall of books is your colour," Ms. MacIntosh says.
Ms. Vogel says the wall serves as a spot for valued possessions.
"I've collected a lot of books over the years - I see books as art - and a lot of memories."

Full text: 15 Baseball Place, No. 908, Toronto RIVERSIDE Asking price: $499,900 (January, 2021) Selling price: $610,000 (February, 2021) Taxes: $2,054 (2021) Days on the market: seven Listing agent: Linda Ing-Gilbert, Re/Max Hallmark Realty Ltd.
THE ACTION This one-bedroomplus-den suite in a newly constructed building was rented out until December of last year. The investor owners held off listing it for sale until it was properly staged and they gauged that the local inventory of condos had sufficiently declined. They decided to go to market in January after the building's condo corporation was registered. Within seven days, they had 10 offers to consider.
"The condo market was really slow in November and December.
We were barely getting showings [for other properties]," agent Linda Ing-Gilbert said. "Then when January hit, the condo market took off."
"Since this was a brand-new building ... nothing had ever sold, so this [sale] was precedent-setting."
WHAT THEY GOT This 575-squarefoot suite at Riverside Square has a loft-inspired design, with ninefoot concrete ceilings and fullheight windows along the principal room and narrow den.
There are quartz countertops in the kitchen and the balcony is outfitted with a gas line.
The unit comes with stacked laundry machines, a storage locker and parking.
Monthly fees of $430 cover water and heating, 24-hour concierge, fitness and recreation facilities.
THE AGENT'S TAKE The bedroom sits at the back of the unit away from the window wall, separated from the living room by a sliding door.
"Some people didn't like that the interior bedroom has no windows," Ms. Ing-Gilbert said. "However, when you're in your room, it's dark, so you can sleep."
"But [the unit] did have a view that wasn't going to be obstructed with another building. You could see the CN Tower off the balcony."

Last call for Yonge Street's iconic Brass Rail Tavern

Full text: Perhaps the tower that eventually rises from the stripclub site should be called Brass, or maybe The Rail.
The family that has long owned the Brass Rail Tavern in downtown Toronto has stuck it out through crusading moralizers, a lap-dancing ban that went to the Supreme Court and a wave of bad press last August, after hundreds of patrons were potentially exposed to COVID-19.
But the lure of high real estate prices is proving too attractive for the owners, who are calling time on a Toronto institution.
The Cooper family recently began shopping around three properties under and beside the Brass Rail. They are not selling the actual Yonge Street strip club - which is currently closed because of pandemic restrictions - but plan to wind up operations as the site is redeveloped.
Daniel Ross, a history professor at the University of Quebec at Montreal whose dissertation was on Yonge Street from the 1950s through 70s, called the club one of the last remnants of Toronto's old vice district. While he won't mourn it, he noted its connection with an era when Yonge was the most vital street in the city.
"The idea of having a single entertainment strip full of taverns, cinemas, restaurants, cocktail bars ... I think there's a lot of nostalgia in Toronto for that," he said.
The Brass Rail, just south of Bloor Street, began as a tavern. It gradually added nudity to the menu, reflecting the broader shift of Yonge Street into what critics denounced as "Sin strip."
The club eventually became a favoured haunt for a certain crowd at the Toronto International Film Festival.
Other celebrities popped in. It was where then-New York Yankee Alex Rodriguez was spotted with what the tabloids described as a "busty blonde" who was not his wife.
But the standard clientele was more prosaic: an earlier generation of Bay Streeters going to what they dubbed "the ballet," university students scratching a frat-boy itch, sweaty bachelorparty revellers.
The Cooper family declined to be interviewed. In a statement, they said "it has become obvious to us that the neighbourhood is evolving with new retail, condos and offices opening all around us."
No price has been set for their properties and bids will be accepted likely later in April. Based on comparative land prices provided by their broker, the 0.21acre site may garner in the range of $32-million.
"We see not only the densification of the Yonge Street strip, but also an increasing quality of the retail tenancies," said the broker, Nicholas Kendrew, of commercial real estate agency Cushman & Wakefield.
"So I think it's a very interesting time to look at a potential redevelopment or repositioning of this property."
Briar de Lange, executive director of the Bloor-Yorkville BIA, called the block's redevelopment "inevitable" given the intensity of construction planned or under way nearby.
Such density and scale was unthinkable when the Cooper family bought the Brass Rail. In the late 1950s, the tallest building in the country was Commerce Court North, standing only 34 storeys in Toronto's financial district.
It was an era of liberalizing Ontario liquor laws, and bars began to proliferate on the strip, finding an eager market.
"Yonge Street's always been a place of entertainment," said Chris Bateman, with Heritage Toronto. "You've got more relaxed laws, more relaxed people. At the end of the day, people wanted to go out and have fun."
In 1969, the Brass Rail promised "five topless Go Go Dancers" in a listing that ran in a local newspaper.
By the early 1970s, when David Letterman bandleader Paul Shaffer got his start at the club, his friends became unusually interested in his playing once he began performing there.
"At the end of the night, you know, the friends are still there," he told NPR on a 2009 book tour for his memoir. "I'm embarrassed and I'm saying please come back and see us, we're happy to have entertained you this evening and we will be here, and it really felt like it, for the rest of our lives."
The Brass Rail spent much of the 1970s as a live-music venue under the name Yonge Station, before relaunching as a full-on strip club, getting a municipal adult entertainment licence in 1982. It began offering lap dances and defied the law when these were banned. The fight went to the Supreme Court, which in 1997 allowed the activity.
Social mores were changing, though. When three city councillors visited another of Toronto's strip clubs in 2009, they felt compelled to explain that they'd been on an "industry facility tour" and hadn't looked at the dancers.
A similar bashfulness was evident last summer among Brass Rail customers. After Toronto Public Health warned that 550 patrons might have been exposed to COVID-19, contact tracing was hampered by the high percentage of them who had given false names.
Meanwhile, Toronto's property market was soaring. The value of the land on which the Brass Rail sits dwarfs its annual revenues, which the data and analytic company Dun & Bradstreet pegs at about $2.4-million.
In its statement, the Cooper family said it had received numerous unsolicited offers for its properties. Once they sell up and close, the only remaining strip club on downtown Yonge will be the Zanzibar.
"It's so interesting how [Yonge] changed," said Heritage Toronto's Mr. Bateman. "The cleanup, I guess, if you want to call it that, the real change in Yonge Street has come in the last 15-20 years, with development."

Real estate agents come together to support women's shelter: PITCHING IN

Full text: The organizer: Greg Schryer The pitch: Creating the Clarington Realty Network The cause: To raise money for Bethesda House, a women's shelter in Durham, Ont.
When Greg Schryer became a real estate agent in Bowmanville, Ont., a few years ago, he felt the industry suffered from an image problem.
"People think real estate agents are making a lot of money and there is this kind of air of individuals doing their own thing, driving around in fancy cars," Mr. Schryer recalled.
He wanted to do something to improve the perception of the trade, so he sought out agents who were eager to make a difference. He brought together a group of 12 and then went in search of a local charity to support. That led him to Jaki MacKinnon, the executive director of Bethesda House, a women's shelter in Durham region east of Toronto.
Ms. MacKinnon told him about some of the families the shelter had helped and how demand for its services had soared during the pandemic.
"When she started telling me the stories of some of the women, I felt like this is way, way bigger than my original idea," Mr. Schryer said. "These women and their kids are literally fleeing their home and abuse, and in COVID a lot of them have nowhere to turn at all."
The group, called Clarington Realty Network, has decided to donate $100 from every sale they close this year. Each agent is also promoting Bethesda on their social-media platforms and leaving information about the shelter with homebuyers. The network plans to select another charity to support next year.
Ms. MacKinnon said the donations will support the shelter's community outreach and counselling services. "I'm just really so impressed that Greg has pulled this together and that the team he has put together is so supportive," she said.
Mr. Schryer gave credit to the other agents who got involved.
"When I came into this profession I didn't have a high opinion of real estate agents," he said.
"But there are some pretty amazing people who do a lot of real estate and who are helping a lot of people."

Full text: 209C Randolph Rd., Toronto LEASIDE Asking price: $1,879,900 (November, 2020) Previous asking price: $2,050,000 (June, 2020); $1,998,800 (August, 2020); $1,950,000 (September, 2020) Selling price: $1,750,000 (January, 2021) Taxes: $7,886 (2020) Days on the market: N/A Listing agents: Nigel Denham and Robert Nelson, Sotheby's International Realty Canada THE ACTION This freehold townhouse without a private yard stood out in a neighbourhood made up mainly of detached single-family homes on their own little patch of ground.
The difficulty in finding a buyer led to three drops in the asking price over several months. The first purchase offer, of $1.75-million, came after it was finally taken off the market and offered for lease.
"In that price point, you're almost getting land value or a tiny three-bedroom bungalow in various levels of decay," agent Nigel Denham said, "whereas this was a large four-bedroom, three-bath home with a good volume of space and everything was 13 years new."
Potential buyers who proved most interested in the property were "a combination of locals or people coming from the city, out of condominiums, looking for a bit more space." WHAT THEY GOT This three-storey townhouse has an elevator, a finished basement with heated floors, a small maintenance-free terrace and direct access to a tandem two-car garage.
The main floor is open concept, with the foyer between the den and living room. Set further back is a dining area and kitchen anchored by a large island with a breakfast bar and built-in wine fridge.
Monthly fees of $210 cover lawn care and snow removal.
THE AGENT'S TAKE The primary bedroom takes up the entire third floor with "a wonderful volume of space with room for a den or home office," Mr. Denham said.

Full text: 195 Colver St., Smithville, Ont.
SMITHVILLE Asking price: $649,900 (January, 2021) Selling price: $710,000 (January, 2021) Previous selling price: $285,000 (November, 2012); $194,000 (October, 2003) Taxes: $3,494 (2020) Days on the market: five Listing agent: Tobias Smulders, Re/Max Escarpment Realty Inc.
THE ACTION This side-split house is in Smithville, a small town midway between Hamilton and Niagara Falls. With demand for homes outside of big cities surging, the few available properties in the area have been selling within days this winter rather than the few weeks that had been typical. This home's quick sale was fuelled by price-conscious buyers driven out of larger cities as far as Toronto, said agent Tobias Smulders.
"Families are moving [here] from out of the area," Mr. Smulders said.
"It sold in multiple offers and over ask, so the value was in line with what we expected," he said, "but that value is quite higher than what it was 12 months ago."
WHAT THEY GOT This 1,449-squarefoot house was built in 1974 with four bedrooms, three bathrooms and walkouts to the private deck, yard and the 79-foot-by-140-foot corner lot.
There is a front den on the main floor with a gas fireplace.
The living and dining rooms are located off an updated kitchen with stainless steel appliances.
THE AGENT'S TAKE "It was a great lot, and it was larger than most," Mr. Smulders said.
"[Side-splits] are common for the neighbourhood, but most of them are slightly smaller with three bedrooms."
For commuters, there is ample parking, including a garage, though it is also steps from local amenities. "It's on the same street as the high school," Mr. Smulders said.
"It has a good, small town feel and is a tight knit community."

Full text: When it comes to investing in commercial property, Aditya Koparde and Shaily Srivastava want to be the new kids on the blockchain.
"We did our MBAs together, and one day when we were having lunch, we wondered how technology might disrupt the real estate investment market," Ms. Srivastava says.
That lunch nearly three years ago led them to co-found Acreageway, a blockchain-based real estate investment company that will be open for business in April.
Mr. Koparde and Ms. Srivastava, the company's president and chief executive officer, respectively, are aware that even people who are sophisticated in finance, investment and property still struggle to understand blockchain and related concepts such as cryptocurrency and bitcoin - and how these might affect the commercial real estate sector.
It's not as complicated as it seems, Mr. Koparde says. "Technology addresses a few challenges that exist in real estate," he explains. "One is [that it] provides a digital platform that can let people invest in property in the same way as they do in stocks and funds."
A new way of raising commercial property finance, investors will, for example, be able to click "buy" on their smartphones to purchase a percentage of a planned new office complex without having to sign a stack of contracts and real estate documents.
Acreageway is just one company seeking to find a niche as the commercial property sector continues to experience a digital transformation.
"The underlying technology of blockchain can be used to improve investment processes, and this is really where it ties into real estate," says Daniel Fuke, partner at Bay Street law firm Fasken and legal adviser for Acreageway.
DELOITTE REPORT According to the Blockchain in Commercial Real Estate report by Deloitte's U.S. Center for Financial Services, the effect of the technology on property will be wideranging: "Blockchain technology can potentially transform core commercial real estate operations such as property transactions like purchase, sale, financing, leasing and management."
A 2015 World Economic Forum survey of 800 executives and tech experts predicted that by 2025, 10 per cent of all global information about gross domestic product - one-tenth of all financial data - will be stored on blockchain technology.
It's important to distinguish between bitcoin, cryptocurrency and blockchain when it comes to commercial real estate investment, Mr. Fuke says. Cryptocurrency is a digital form of money; bitcoin is one of several types of cryptocurrency that are produced by "miners" - computer programmers who collect payments from people around the world and issue them "non-fungible tokens," or NFTs, that rise and fall in value just like dollars, euros or yen.
"It may be a bit early to get excited about concepts like bitcoin for real estate, but blockchain can make a big difference," Mr. Fuke says. "It can expand the pool of investors and may therefore increase property values [as more investors come aboard on projects]."
Blockchain is the process that documents all these transactions electronically - no matter how they're paid for - in a way that's easy for everyone to see and hard for anyone to tamper with. It's all recorded and stored digitally, so there's always a copy somewhere.
As more and more transactions are performed, completed and stored using blockchain and there's a permanent e-record of everything, mid-level services, such as title searchers, may become obsolete.
"Some real estate-related services may go the way of travel agencies," Ms. Srivastava says.
There may still be niche services, "but blockchain can take out the cost of transferring ownership in property without the involvement of banks, lawyers' trust accounts and so on," she explains.
The idea behind enabling people to buy small shares in commercial real estate is to "tokenize" transactions the same way a bitcoin is a token. Shares of real estate can be bought and sold electronically, and the token is recorded on blockchain rather than on a dusty deed.
Along with blockchain, bitcoin eventually may also play a role in the way people invest in commercial property. However, the way you pay is not as significant as the record-keeping yet, says Addison Cameron-Huff, a Toronto lawyer who specializes in cryptocurrency law.
"People will just buy and sell using the local currency," he says.
"It's easier - international buyers in Toronto will pay in Canadian dollars."
ENERGY CONSUMPTION Nevertheless, cryptocurrency can have some impact on the types of properties that investors covet, Mr. Cameron-Huff says.
"That's because the production and maintaining of actual bitcoins requires large amounts of energy," he explains, referring to the reliance on huge computers that solve the algorithms that become increasingly complicated as more people buy and sell their bitcoins.
All that computer power eats electricity, generates heat and must be kept cool. Cryptocurrency producers are seeking properties that have access to cheap electric power, often in remote places.
"If you have a bitcoin storage site in the Northwest Territories or northern Alberta, you can cool it by just opening the door," says Mitchell Demeter, president of Netcoins Inc., a Vancouver-based company that works with cryptocurrency investors.
Investors are also looking at using natural gas that is flared off in southern Alberta oil fields to produce energy that can be used in buildings stuffed with cryptochurning computers, says Cale Moodie, CEO of Neptune Digital Assets Corp., a cryptocurrency company based in Vancouver.
"There's ample excess energy in Alberta that's otherwise not being used, and in addition to flared-off gas, there's potential for properties [that service bitcoin] in places with hydro power," he says.
Mr. Moodie and Acreageway's founders see the blockchaining of real estate as part of a larger shift in the financing, development and redevelopment of commercial property.
"You need a lot of money to put up a big building. Up to now, it's been hard to get in and out of something you invest in, and with all the paperwork, it's not that transparent or easy to see how much you own of what," Mr. Koparde says.
Turning bricks and mortar into digitally recorded tokens can put small retail investors just a click away from owning a tiny piece of real estate and help those who finance projects find the funds they need.
In the end, digitizing real estate finance is a way to move money that builders now have to seek from big banks and institutional lenders such as megapension funds, Mr. Koparde says.
"Our dream is to have a fully licensed digital platform where ordinary people can reap the benefits of real estate investment."

Full text: When Stephanie Hunter and Braden Bonwick were searching for a house in the Niagara region, they were given a brief opportunity to view the properties and were advised to provide a cover letter and photo of themselves as they competed with dozens of buyers for homes that were selling for $100,000 over the asking price.
"It felt like we were playing a game of chance," Ms. Hunter said. "You have 15 minutes to look at a place while a line of agents and their clients is forming outside the front door asking if you're almost done.
Then finding out the home you just had 15 minutes to look at had 65 viewings that day and all offers have to be in by 5 p.m. tomorrow."
Welcome to the small city housing frenzy, where Toronto and Vancouver real estate tactics have become the norm.
There are no home inspections and no conditional offers - and bids are routinely well over asking.
Since the pandemic began, buyers have sought more room for their home offices, entertainment and living. That has sent prices soaring and prompted recent warnings of real estate bubbles in areas well outside Toronto - not surburbs, but places that are 1.5 to two hours from downtown Toronto and have never experienced an overheated real estate market or at least one this hot. Niagara, Barrie, Tillsonburg, Woodstock, Ingersoll, Prince Edward County, Kawartha Lakes, Grey-Bruce Owen Sound and other smaller markets in Ontario have seen home prices climb more than 30 per cent.
"At first, everybody was excited because anybody looking to move up could sell their house and they made a pretty penny," said Jim Diodati, the mayor of Niagara Falls. "Until they realized you make more money when you sell, [but] you are also going to pay more money when you buy."
Now, smaller cities are increasingly grappling with the same problems created by skyrocketing real estate prices - unaffordability and housing inequity - that have plagued Toronto and Vancouver for decades.
"Appreciating real estate values show that you have a desirable market. On the other end, it is becoming unaffordable for people trying to enter the market," said Mr. Diodati, who worries about housing for younger generations. "We are asking ourselves: Is this going to be an obstacle that they cannot get past? Are we committing our kids to renting for a long, long time?" Barrie Mayor Jeff Lehman said his city is facing the same issues: "Not being able to afford housing - that is a problem in a number of places in Canada and it is a growing problem here."
The benchmark price of a detached house in Barrie reached $721,000 in February. That was almost $100,000 more than three months ago and about $200,000 more than a year ago, according to Canadian Real Estate Association data. Three years ago, the price of a detached house in the city was less than $500,000; five years ago, it was less than $400,000.
Barrie, which is a 1.5-hour train ride from downtown Toronto, is also now one of the country's priciest rental markets. The average monthly rent for a two-bedroom apartment was $1,393 last fall, according to the latest data from Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. That puts Barrie fifth, behind Toronto, Vancouver, Ottawa and Victoria.
"I am definitely concerned about this. We had an affordable housing crisis before this happened," Mr. Lehman said, adding that lower-income workers had to move farther out of the city even before the recent surge in real estate prices.
The same run-up in prices has happened elsewhere in the past few months. Detached houses in Kitchener-Waterloo, Burlington and Mississauga have gone up by a minimum of $100,000 over three months. In Milton and Oakville, prices are almost $200,000 more than they were in November.
The average price of a house in Hamilton, a commuter city that used to be considered affordable, is almost $800,000.
In Prince Edward County, a popular vacation area for Torontonians and Quebeckers, a local realtor says prices have become disconnected from reality. Treat Hull, who has sold properties in the county for almost a decade, said his region is in a real estate bubble. "I am really worried that we're heading for a train wreck à la Toronto in 1990. I hope I am wrong," he said.
Even places such as Owen Sound and Niagara Falls, which have had depressed prices for decades, have seen a flood of Toronto-region buyers looking for more room and access to nature. "A lot of people in big cities are reimagining their way of life," said Owen Sound Mayor Ian Boddy, who agrees with the other mayors that higher prices are a double-edged sword.
That was the case for Ms. Hunter and Mr. Bonwick. After 17 years of living in Toronto, they were sick of renting small, gardenless spaces and tired of the expenses that accompany city living. The couple, in their late 30s, envisioned buying their first house in St. Catharines, where they both grew up.
"Braden and I imagined we'd move back and find the perfect starter home. How difficult can that be? Ha ha," Ms. Hunter said.
The longer they looked, the pricier homes got. They turned to Niagara Falls after being priced out of St. Catharines.
Ms. Hunter said the process was "frustrating, discouraging and upsetting."
"You have to decide quickly if you both liked it and then try to figure out what kind of number you want to throw out there in hopes that they'll pick you, while trying not to become house poor.
Then you sit and wait, only to hear they went with an offer that came in $100,000 over asking," she said.
The couple made offers on five properties and competed against 15 to 25 buyers each time. They finally found a house in Niagara Falls for less than $450,000 and said their offer with no conditions put them ahead of the pack.

Parking a flash point in Toronto density disputes

Full text: One of the best deals for land in the city of Toronto is the low price paid to park a private car on the public streets in some of Toronto's most expensive downtown neighbourhoods. But it's a privilege councillors who represent those communities are increasingly denying to newcomers.
The approvals process for the rezoning of 1327-1339 Queen St.
East near Greenwood Avenue in the city's east end began in 2016, with the builder, Rockport Group, seeking the go-ahead for The George condos, an eightstorey mid-rise condominium with 80 apartments and eight townhouses. During the summer of 2020, local councillor Paula Fletcher requested a traffic study to understand the impact the development might have on the permit parking in the surrounding residential streets.
On Feb. 2, under the innocuous-sounding motion Realignment of Permit Parking Area 8d to Exclude the Development Located at 1327-1339 Queen Street East, the full council approved a permanent ban on any future resident of George applying for onstreet permit parking in the area.
The Transportation Services study concluded local parking was 80-per-cent full, with 1,488 permits already issued in the 8D area out of 1,842 possible spaces.
"This area does not have a history of being waitlisted, meaning the demand for overnight onstreet parking permits has never exceeded the supply of parking spaces," the report reads.
To developer Jack Winberg, chief executive officer of Rockport Group, the whole thing came out of left field. "It came up as a surprise to us; we didn't think there's any reason for it," he said.
The motion also required that the builder's marketing materials notify potential residents that they would not be able to get permit parking.
Mr. Winberg said that condition couldn't be met for buyers who had already purchased their units years ago. "We're now getting ready to register our condominium - it's 90-something-per cent sold!" he said of the building, which has 71 parking spots on site for residents, and an additional five for visitors.
"We had parking for threequarters of our purchasers, so it's only going to affect a small number of people. But we have heard from a couple who have cars, and would like to park and are upset about this."
Ms. Fletcher says she's been applying permit-parking exclusions to rezoning application sites since 2005 (a church conversion on Jones Avenue). In recent years, her fellow downtown councillors, such as Gord Perks and Mike Layton, have asked for and received parking exclusions for projects in their wards, too.
About a half-dozen times a year, a new "realignment" is created banning future residents from local streets (there have already been five realignments in 2021).
"Basically, new development should not overwhelm the existing character of the neighbourhood, of the streets that are often at 80- or 90-per-cent permit parking from residential, low-rise," Ms. Fletcher said. "When we're thinking in a bigger way about introducing a lot of density on a main street like Queen ... we're introducing that density because there's transit there. There's spaces the developer has to supply based on planning requirements, so there really should be no reason why anybody would need to park on the street."
Some frame the issue as one of increasing density putting pressure on the scarce on-street spaces in "stable" downtown single-family home neighbourhoods (where studies have shown population numbers are actually declining.) But it might also be pointed out that on-street permit parking is incredibly cheap.
That annual fee for on-street parking for a homeowner's first vehicle (if you have no on-site parking) is $201.72, or about 55 cents a night. If it's your second car, it's $676.52 a year, or about $1.70 a night. If it's just for convenience (you have on-site parking available) it's $881.40 a year, or $2.40 a night.
True, drivers don't get to choose where their spot is with on-street parking; it could be in front of their house (the average price in Toronto-Danforth is $1.4million) or it could be two streets away, but that chunk of asphalt under the car remains the cheapest land to occupy in the city.
The city of Toronto has about 40,000 permitted spaces and in 2019 made $9,847,130 from onstreet permits, most at the $201 annual rate.
By comparison, the 19,000 spaces run by the Toronto Parking Authorities (TPA) commercial on-street parking program generated $46-million in profits on revenues of $57-million. (TPA is the city's third-largest revenue earner, No. 1 being property taxes).
Monthly spot rentals can be had for $200 or more a month. If you prefer to own a private space in a condominium parking garage the prices range between $35,000 and $100,000, according to listings on Realtor.ca. For $35,000 you could keep your car on a city street for 174 years at the current rate for permits.
"What irks me is that a new resident is seen as a second-class citizen with fewer rights," said George Popper, an architect who specializes in infill development and has seen previous projects of his excluded from on-street parking.
"We've reached a saturation point for permit parking," Ms. Fletcher argues. She said she is encouraging more car-sharing by allowing those programs to access permit parking spaces and is pushing for more bike-lanes and transit service.

Full text: TORONTO Waterfront estates and historic homes are some of the carriage trade properties finding new owners as real estate buyers look to a future beyond the coronavirus pandemic.
Adrienne Lake, broker with Sotheby's International Realty Canada in Oakville, Ont., says one property, which has been on and off the market since 2016, recently sold for $18.62-million.
Kingsley Qin, a real estate agent with Sotheby's, first listed the opulent four-bedroom, six-bathroom residence at 489 Lakeshore Rd. East with an asking price of $17.9-million. The neo-classical mansion on one acre of land was on the market for 438 days at that price, says Mr. Qin, who adds that homes in that rarified atmosphere tend to take a long time to find new owners.
"About five years is typical," Mr. Qin says. "These kinds of sales are very few and far between. In this price range, each property is very unique in its own way."
Designer Ferris Rafauli created the 16,000-square-foot house, which includes a grand staircase, home theatre and indoor swimming pool.
As the global demand for highend real estate rose over those five years, Mr. Qin raised the price to its most recent level of $21,999,999.
The property actually sold conditionally near the asking price to a couple in Singapore in March, 2020, he says. When the coronavirus pandemic disrupted global travel and financial markets, they struggled for three weeks to get funds out of Singapore before the deal fell apart.
"Unfortunately the offer could not go through," Mr. Qin says.
He adds that clients from around the world - including Europe, Russia, the Middle East, South America and the United States - have been shopping for luxury properties in Oakville, west of Toronto.
The past year, however, has been more difficult as people coped with the pandemic.
He believes sentiment is changing now that vaccines are being rolled out and there's less uncertainty surrounding the strength of global economies.
"I think people see the light at the end of the tunnel."
Mr. Qin says the buyer is a local resident who decided to take advantage of the dampened interest from overseas before borders reopen.
"The buyer said, ‘I don't want to compete with international buyers.' " Ms. Lake points out there are currently only four properties for sale in the range between $10-million and $50-million in Oakville and nearby areas.
"There really isn't a lot for the consumer to choose from."
Some houses also change hands quietly without going on the open market.
"A large portion of them are pocket listings," Mr. Qin says.
Chelster Hall, the palatial home built by former Interbrew SA chief executive Hugo Powell at 1150 Lakeshore Rd. East in Oakville, was listed in 2016 with an asking price of $65-million. Ms. Lake says the waterfront estate was relisted with Sotheby's and the price was reduced over time but the property did not find a buyer during that time.
It recently sold in a private deal after the listing expired, she says.
Ms. Lake, who is the managing broker for Sotheby's offices in Oakville and Niagara, does not see a large number of listings coming onto the spring market. Competition amongst buyers, meanwhile, is more frenetic than it was during the run-up of early 2017, in her opinion.
"I think the market's going to continue to be very, very tight," she says. "A lot of agents can't really pinpoint why there is this feeding frenzy."
Leslie Battle, a real estate agent with Royal LePage Real Estate Services Ltd., says demand is "off the charts" in the upper echelons of west-end Toronto and Etobicoke.
This week Ms. Battle recently listed a 4,500-square-foot house backing onto a ravine at 3 The Kingsway with an asking price of $8.5-million. While houses selling in that price range are rare in the west end, she says many move-up buyers are looking for lots of indoor and outdoor space to roam.
Ms. Battle points to one house on Baby Point Crescent in Toronto's west as an example. The property received five offers and sold above the $6-million mark last week after it was listed with an asking price of $5.995-million.
Low interest rates are encouraging buyers with means to move up the property ladder, she says.
"Money is cheap."
The listings drought is putting pressure on buyers to compete for the few properties that do become available.
"I don't think there's been a lot of inventory anywhere in the west end. That's what is keeping our prices sky-high."
Many buyers are seeking larger backyards and extra bedrooms that can be turned into offices.
In the past, homes in the west end selling above $4-million tended to be those rare properties backing onto a ravine or a golf course in pockets such as the Kingsway, Baby Point, Riverside Drive and Edenbridge, she says.
Now, some of the interior streets in the Kingsway enclave are selling north of the $4-million mark. The properties that have changed hands in that price range are newly-built houses on soughtafter streets such as Queen Mary's Drive and Wendover Road, she says.
Ms. Battle says competition is intense in every price range and segment. Many agents use the tactic of setting prices far below market value in order to spark competition, she says, and that can be unnerving for buyers when they need to pay hundreds of thousands more than the list price.
She recently worked with buyers who submitted one of 13 bids for a house on Wilgar Road, near Royal York Road and Bloor Street West.
The clients surpassed the other bidders with their offer of $2.34million, or $541,000 above the asking price of $1.799-million.
Ms. Battle says the client questioned why he needed to pay a $500,000 premium and she advised him that the market value of the house was closer to $2.2-million. In that light, the premium was closer to $100,000.
"They're going for massive competition," she says of the sellers' agents. "That is the game. The challenge for agents right now is explaining value to their clients."
Bank of Nova Scotia economist Farah Omran says the latest data from the Canadian Real Estate Association show that the strongerthan-expected trend in the Canadian housing market witnessed over the course of 2020 is continuing into 2021.
CREA reported that sales in Canada jumped 39 per cent in February compared with the same month last year. The national average sale price rose 25 per cent last month compared with February, 2020.
Ms. Omran notes that listings rose in February from January but, in many areas, any new listings are absorbed immediately.
At the current rate of sales activity, national inventories would be liquidated in 1.8 months. Ontario has less than one month of inventory, she adds.

Full text: When officials at WE Charity acquired a pair of rare Nokota horses in 2010, they seemed like perfect additions to the organization's 36-acre ranch in southern Arizona.
The horses - Lakita's Moon and Smokey - were an instant hit with visitors to WE's Windsong Peace and Leadership Center, which included a 6,000-square-foot main house and two other residences.
But within a few years, Lakita's Moon was dead, Smokey had vanished, and the centre was run down and draining cash. WE closed it in 2018 and sold it a year later for less than half its assessed value.
The tale of Windsong has been a little-known chapter in the WE story. But the episode sheds new light on how WE's rapid expansion led to financial pressure and, at times, haphazard disclosure.
Years after they were last seen on the ranch, Lakita's Moon and Smokey are still listed as assets on the charity's financial filings.
Windsong was built in 1990 and for years was the luxurious home of Virginia and Shaw Benderly, a philanthropic couple from New York who owned a bus company. Ms. Benderly met Craig Kielburger in 1995 at a conference in California and immediately became enamoured with the young crusader. At the time, Mr. Kielburger was making a name for himself as a teenaged activist campaigning against child labour. He eventually created WE Charity with his brother, Marc, and broadened the scope of his activism to include improving health care and education in developing countries.
Ms. Benderly became a lifelong WE supporter and a major donor. She was so committed to the organization that she drove to Toronto every year for the charity's annual meeting and hosted fundraising events at the Arizona ranch. At one point, she offered to donate the estate to the organization, but the board of WE Charity's U.S. branch balked. According to a source familiar with the discussions, the directors didn't believe the ranch fit within WE's objectives and felt it would be too hard to manage. Ms. Benderly kept pressing, and in 2005 WE finally accepted the ranch as a gift.
The property was a challenging proposition. It included the sprawling main house, which had a butler's pantry, a wine cellar, a sunken marble bathtub and a library. Ms. Benderly played the harp, and parts of the home had custom-made cork floors for sound proofing. There was also an eight-car garage with a bunk house and a 1,300-square-foot gatekeeper's cottage. While the location had stunning vistas and access to a state park, it was also remote - roughly 100 kilometres south of Tucson.
WE quickly transformed it into the Windsong Peace and Leadership Centre and made modifications to accommodate rows of bunkbeds. The charity appointed Erin Blanding as director, and she had big plans to make it a topflight educational centre.
Windsong began running summer camps for children and programs for local schools. Campers paid about US$800 a week and learned about immigration, border issues and the environment.
At the end of their stay, they would receive certificates in "Me to We Leadership" or "Me to We Facilitation."
Windsong's mission, Ms. Blanding noted in a promotional video, was to "guide students to find their passions and how to have an impact on the world."
As WE expanded globally and attracted more and more corporate sponsors, the Kielburgers created ME to WE Social Enterprises Inc. in 2009. The company specialized in selling WE products and offering excursions to places where WE Charity operated, including Windsong. The Kielburgers have long insisted that at least half the company's profits went to WE Charity.
The division between the business and the charity sometimes became murky, including at Windsong. For example, while ME to WE ran the centre and included it among the company's travel packages, property records show it was owned by WE Charity. Most of Windsong's assets also appeared on the financial statements of WE Charity U.S., including the buildings, the horses, four vehicles and a signature machine.
A few years after Windsong opened, Susan Ballard decided it would be a good place to donate Lakita's Moon and Smokey, which she'd bought in North Dakota. Ms. Ballard lives on the Blue Moon Ranch with her husband, Brian, about 140 kilometres east of Windsong.
She has a keen interest in Wild West folklore and has written half a dozen books about life on the frontier, including a trilogy of novels based on the exploits of Doc Holliday and Wyatt Earp, the lawmen involved in the shootout at the O.K. Corral in 1881.
Ms. Ballard loves horses and took a particular liking to Lakita's Moon and Smokey, with their illustrious pedigree. Like all Nokotas, they were descendants of a herd owned by Chief Sitting Bull, who united the Sioux against white settlers in the 1870s.
But shortly after the Ballards bought the pair - for about US$3,000 each - Ms. Ballard broke both her hips and couldn't ride any more. A friend told her about Windsong, and Ms. Ballard offered to donate the horses, which were both about four years old at the time.
"We just wanted to find a good home for them, and this place, somebody recommended it, and it sounded like a nice place for the horses to go," she recalled in an interview.
She was told a couple of years later by WE that Lakita's Moon had died from a pre-existing condition. WE also asked if she would take back Smokey. "They said they were closing down and they had to get rid of everybody," Ms. Ballard said. She couldn't take back the horse, but told WE she had a friend who was interested in buying Smokey, but WE never got back to her.
By 2015 Windsong was in financial trouble. While the camps attracted as many as 50 students at a time, the cost of running the centre had become onerous. "They were trying to close it for years, but it was sort of [Ms. Blanding's] baby and she kept it running," recalled Justin Bramhall, Windsong's former property manager.
He'd been hired in May, 2015, and was promised an annual budget of US$100,000 to fix up the property and install a host of environmentally friendly services such as rain-water harvesting, composting toilets and solar heating for the water supply. But the money never materialized, and Mr. Bramhall said the pressure from WE's head office in Toronto mounted.
He did his best to maintain the ranch and keep up the small collection of chickens and goats and some 30 sheep. Smokey was gone before he arrived, but Marc Kielburger directed Windsong to get another horse. "Marc wanted a horse there for marketing purposes, so they scrambled to get Poco from a local horse sanctuary place," Mr. Bramhall said, explaining that Mr. Kielburger felt that a horse would attract campers. "After two years I ended up giving Poco back to that horse sanctuary."
Ms. Blanding, who was unavailable for comment, left Windsong in 2017 for a posting with WE in Toronto. (She has since left the organization.) By then the charity had opened its 43,000-squarefoot Global Learning Center in the city's downtown - and Windsong's days were numbered.
In February, 2018, WE announced that Windsong would close that summer. "As WE continues to learn and grow, we have reached a point in our journey where we were faced with a difficult decision to make," the charity said in a statement at the time.
"They told us their focus was gearing them in other directions," Mr. Bramhall said. "They had just opened the WE Global Learning Center and they were financially strapped as a result of that and just didn't see Windsong fitting into their objectives. My theory is they didn't want it from the getgo."
In a statement, WE said it couldn't provide details about the ranch. "As you mentioned, our centre in Arizona was closed in 2018 and no one involved with the purchase is still with the organization," the charity said. "Confirming further details has been challenging as the staff involved in the centre left the organization after it closed. We believe one horse passed and one horse was provided to a local not-for-profit animal care organization."
Jean Miller, a local real estate agent, was hired in April, 2018, to find a buyer for Windsong and immediately ran into problems. The buildings required extensive repairs, and the remodelling WE had done to accommodate campers had been so shoddy that there were exposed pipes in a makeshift bathroom. Ms. Miller estimated that roof work alone would cost US$25,000 and said some of the walls had been infested with termites. "It was a mess. It was just a difficult, difficult, difficult thing to sell," she recalled.
County officials had appraised the house at as much as US$1.3million, according to property records, but Ms. Miller initially listed it at US$749,000. It sat on the market for a year before it was finally bought in October, 2019, by Robin Stevens and her husband, Morgan Guynes, the half-brother of actress Demi Moore. The couple paid US$506,000.
"Unfortunately, [WE] did not upkeep the property and it was, is, very run down," Ms. Stevens said in an e-mail. "It's sad because the original owners made this place beautiful. We are hoping to bring it back to the beautiful place it once was."

Full text: 258 MacNab St. N.
HAMILTON Asking Price: $1,798,000 Taxes: $8,273 (2020) Lot Size: 46 feet by 122 feet Agent: Colette Cooper, broker, Royal LePage State Realty THE BACKSTORY The Victorian terrace on MacNab Street North in downtown Hamilton is a local landmark, not least because it doesn't look like anything else in the city. That's thanks to the design by noted local architect James Balfour. The six-unit row built in 1880 blends the wooden bays of Italianate row houses popular in San Francisco (that city's famous Painted Ladies) with features of Victorian Gothic designs (steep, ornate gables and bargeboard).
The craftsmanship of the woodwork and brickwork has stood the test of time.
"We always liked that terrace. We'd walk by it and admire it," said Tom Baker, who owns 258 MacNab St. N., which sits at the centre of the row. "When it showed up with a for-sale sign [in 1989], it sounds romantic and silly, but we just loved the place from the first time we'd seen it."
A City of Hamilton heritage report says the terrace house was first owned by the family of Henry Larkin, a barrister and developer who also commissioned Mr. Balfour to build a nearby Renaissance Revival office block now known as Treble Hall. In 1942, the six row houses in the Larkin terrace were subdivided between five owners with the two homes in the centre of the block that connect above the carriage gateway combined into one home.
For Mr. Baker, who saw potential in the stately old home, the only complication was that it wasn't an ordinary Victorian residence. The houses had been joined together, with the upper two floors converted to a rooming house. A dozen long-time lodgers shared one kitchen.
"We were kind of tortured about it; it hadn't been kept up to the same level it should have been.
People said, "Why don't you just buy a regular house?" said Mr. Baker, a veterinarian who specializes in disease control in livestock and poultry. "It was a pretty challenged area at the time. We had a lot of real estate agents in our family who felt it was not where ‘respectable' people should be living."
And indeed, at first, they didn't live there, running the building as a rooming house with a property manager living in a main-floor apartment for the first dozen years. But all along, they had been upgrading the building, and in 2003 began to change the units over when longer-term residents vacated, adding more bathrooms to rooms. Now, of the 10 "guest rooms," seven have bathrooms. In 2006, they added a two-storey addition onto the back of the house and moved in themselves.
"It was an interesting neighbourhood even then; a lot of old families had lived there and raised their children. You still had a lot of poor people and marginalized people," Mr. Baker said. "James Street was pretty quiet back then, too - it was certainly not the arts and culture scene we see now."
As Mr. Baker referenced, things have changed in the past 20 years. There's a GO train station a block north of the building, and Hamilton's downtown has seen a renaissance, though dampened now by the pandemic.
"I'm impressed by the number of young kids growing up in the downtown. We're seeing a lot of professional families with kids and a dog," he said.
THE HOUSE TODAY The house itself is huge: more than 6,000 square feet with two currently occupied ground-floor apartments and a half-dozen lodgers upstairs on medium-term stays.
Mr. Baker has changed the demographic of guests to professionals and postgraduate students who visit McMaster University or the city's hospitals. He admits he'd like to see someone carry on the business, maybe with more attention to a short-stay model. "If you're younger and have the energy, there's not much else available in downtown Hamilton [in terms of hotels]," he said.
The current floor plan has the entrance to the guest rooms on the left side of the carriage gate (which hides a pass-through to a rear courtyard that has space for six cars but has also been partially landscaped for outdoor entertainment).
Just inside is a set of stairs that takes you upstairs to the guest rooms, and down a short hall is the door to a separate ground-level apartment that encompasses the original Victorian living room and dining room, with a kitchen and full bathroom, and one bedroom at the back with a separate entrance to the rear.
On the second floor are five guest rooms - the two facing the front are the largest, 17 feet by 8 feet, with their own ensuite bathrooms. A third room with its own bath sits in the rear corner; next to it is the common kitchen and a laundry closet. There are two smaller rooms with no ensuite, and a shared bathroom at the end of the hall.
On the third floor are five more guest rooms. Again the two units facing the street are the largest, and the two in the rear corners are a little smaller. Only one room on this level doesn't have its own bathroom.
The owner's suite is back downstairs on the right side of the carriage gate. There's a stairwell here as well that goes up to the guest rooms, but on the right is a doorway to a space that was once a living room and is now more like a lobby of sorts. Just through it is the old dining room, now used by Mr. Baker as an office to conduct tenant business. A door in the rear of this room can be closed off to separate it from the kitchen, remodelled in 2006 with a breakfast bar.
There's also a powder room and the entrance to the rear courtyard. Just beyond this is the two-storey addition and a rear sunroom on the back of the house.
A stairwell here at the back goes upstairs to the primary bedroom suite, which has its own laundry. The bedroom sits under a vaulted ceiling with skylights, facing a rear wall of windows that looks toward James Street. The bathroom evokes Victorian elegance, with a clawfooted soaker tub and subway tile walls, but also has a large separated shower with glass enclosure.
WHO'S IN THE MARKET?
"We've had different types of buyers," listing agent Colette Cooper said.
"Some see it strictly as an investment, where they continue running it as a guest house. We're also getting multigenerational families interested; I've had one showing where the mother wants to buy it as a business, and her daughter will be the property manager. I've got a group of friends - [about eight] retired artists - they want to all live together, they can't each afford to buy a place for themselves, certainly not in Toronto."
The price is steep for someone planning to convert it to a single or even multifamily home - but then so, too, are all the prices in Hamilton these days.
"This is the highest market I've ever seen, the only thing that came closer was in 2017. ... It's unbelievable what I'm seeing," Ms. Cooper said. "A lot of the Hamilton first-time buyers are priced right out, and they are looking to Brantford, Cayuga and Caledonia; and now those markets are on fire."
The issue in Hamilton, as it is everywhere, is a lack of available inventory.
"It's almost like a catch-22: I have a number of people who want to sell, but they don't want to sell until they purchase, and that's the issue. I'm showing 20 houses to a buyer before they finally get something," Ms. Cooper said.
Mr. Baker and his wife are staying in the downtown, in a smaller house they purchased a few years ago. They are ready to retire and not have to fix so many toilets, but they are keen to have a front-row seat to see what comes next in the Steel City.

Full text: The Bank of Canada's continued low-interest-rate policy risks sending home prices up further, economists say, adding to concerns that the market is overheated and debt levels will be unmanageable when rates do start to rise.
In its scheduled Wednesday monetary policy announcement, the central bank said housing activity has been "much stronger than expected," while keeping its key interest rate at 0.25 per cent.
The central bank is facing a tricky predicament: It needs to keep interest rates down to stimulate an economy that has been sideswiped by the COVID-19 pandemic without encouraging excessive borrowing and driving home prices even higher.
"The Bank of Canada is in a challenging position at the moment. Low rates will support the economic recovery, but it does risk encouraging the housing frenzy," said Sri Thanabalasingam, a senior economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank.
"The bank may leave it to other policy makers to rein in the housing parade."
Since the pandemic started, home prices and sales have been setting new highs for months, driven by cheap borrowing, low inventory and a shift to detached properties outside of major cities.
Suburbs and semirural areas have seen the sharpest price increases, with some seeing property values rising more than 30 per cent over the year.
"Setting expectations of no movement in interest rates for another two years, while having merits for the broader economy and job market, could add further fuel to housing," said Robert Kavcic, a senior economist at Bank of Montreal.
The Bank of Canada's announcement reiterated that it did not expect to raise the benchmark interest rate until 2023 and would continue stimulating the economy with its bond-buying program until the recovery is well under way.
"It seems that with this message today they played it safe, not really committing to anything and by design not to spook the market and to manage the delicate balance between the recovery and housing," said CIBC deputy chief economist Benjamin Tal.
Although low interest rates have made it easier for borrowers to service their debt, they are also sending residential mortgage debt to a record high. The pace of mortgage borrowing is at its highest level since 2010, when the country was recovering from the global financial crisis.
"The higher the household debt is, the more vulnerable to rate hikes," said Ksenia Bushmeneva, an economist at TD. "High levels of debt make households vulnerable to future interest-rate increases," she said.
While the real estate sector has led the economic recovery, the mortgage debt accumulation has put households in a more precarious position. As well, the significant price increases has made more parts of the country unaffordable. National Bank of Canada's latest affordability report showed cities that were once considered affordable, such as Hamilton, are becoming well out of reach for local residents.
"Policy makers have to strike a fine balance between maintaining one of the stronger economic sectors on track while the pandemic is still a threat, and the build-up of household debt vulnerabilities that accompanies the housing market frenzy," said Robert Hogue, a senior economist with Royal Bank of Canada.

Full text: Beacon Hall Golf Club members narrowly turned down a $250million offer for the Toronto-area property that would have put more than $900,000 in each golfer's wallet, the latest in a string of showdowns between urban course owners and real estate developers.
The 260 members at Beacon Hall, consistently rated among the top 10 courses in the country, voted 63 per cent in favour of selling the 200-acre property in Aurora, Ont., to developer Treasure Hill Homes. The club's rules require two-thirds of members approve its sale, so the offer was turned down after falling eight votes short of approval. The club told members the results late Friday.
"As a community builder, Treasure Hill is very respectful of the legacy of Beacon Hall Golf Club and its significance both to the town of Aurora and the golf community," Nicholas Fidei, president and founder of Vaughan-based Treasure Hill, said on Sunday. He said: "Our group respects the members' decision not to sell the club at this time."
A number of Beacon Hall golfers said the two-year sales process, which drew a number of potential buyers, has created a rift in the membership. In general terms, the debate over the club's future was generational, pitting wealthy, older golfers against younger members.
Beacon Hall, which opened in 1988, draws heavily from the Bay Street financial community.
Memberships cost $40,000 and $80,000, depending on when they were purchased, so the sale of the club represented a potential lottery-sized payday.
The minority of members who voted to keep the club going included retired or semi-retired golfers, many of whom live near Aurora and play upward of 100 rounds a year at Beacon Hall.
Many younger members, who might play 20 times in a season, pushed for a sale, knowing they could cash in, then join another club.
Aurora Mayor Tom Mrakas opposed plans to redevelop Beacon Hall when the proposed sale was first announced in November. After the results of the vote came out on Friday, Mr. Mrakas said, "This is welcome news as Aurora retains this world class golf course and the valuable green space that our community cherishes."
Across Canada, a number of urban golf courses have been turned into neighbourhoods.
However, these plans typically kick off battles that pit golfers and local residents against developers.
Members at the National Golf Club of Canada, a course in Woodbridge that's considered one of the country's top tracks, turned down a $120-million development offer last year. ClubLink, which owns more than 50 courses, faces opposition to its plans for redeveloping Glen Abbey Golf Club in Oakville, site of numerous Canadian Open tournaments, and the Kanata Golf and Country Club in Ottawa.
The most recent statistics from Golf Canada, the sport's national governing body, said 51 courses shut down between 2015 and 2018, including 19 in Ontario. In the same period, 22 new courses were either launched or under construction.
During the pandemic, golfers embraced the game as a safe way to play and the number of rounds played across Canada soared by 19 per cent in 2020 compared with the previous year, according to the National Golf Club Owners Association Canada. Club course revenue rose by 29 per cent, year over year, according to the NGCOA.

Full text: 10701 County Road 2 GRAFTON, ONT.
Asking price: $1,495,000 Taxes: $5,208.80 (2021) Lot size: Approximately 7 acres Agent: Lee Caswell, Bosley Real Estate Ltd.
THE BACKSTORY Growing up in Port Hope, Ont., Lee Caswell was surrounded by heritage buildings in the town where the first European settlers were United Empire Loyalists. Mr. Caswell went on to own and operate his eponymous antiques business in the historic downtown.
"Everyone said, ‘You're going to have to go to the city,' but I never did."
Mr. Caswell's expertise landed him a role as an appraiser on all four seasons of Canadian Antiques Roadshow. He has a long involvement with the Port Hope chapter of the Architectural Conservancy of Ontario.
So when Mr. Caswell and his partner, Blaise Gaetz, learned five years ago that a historic former inn was coming up for sale in the nearby village of Grafton, they were immediately intrigued.
The property was carved from a large swath of land the British Crown granted to the Anglican clergy along the north shore of Lake Ontario after the American Revolutionary War.
Local property records show that T.M. Spalding purchased a parcel from the clergy and, in 1834, built a stately brick dwelling with Georgian influences. He opened it as the Spalding Inn along the thoroughfare known at the time as the Kingston Road.
The inn became the halfway house for travellers making the three-day journey by stage coach from Kingston to Toronto.
Eventually the inn became a single-family home that belonged to only a handful of owners over the years.
"It has huge stretches of time when it was owned by the same family," Mr. Caswell says.
The owners in the 1990s brought a circa 1850 Quebec log cabin piece-by-piece to Ontario and had it reassembled on the property to house their business, Van Schyndel-Lachapelle Antiques.
Mr. Caswell and Mr. Gaetz decided to make the move from Port Hope to the hamlet of Grafton.
"It's my first time living in the country," Mr. Caswell says. "The opportunity came to buy it and why not take the plunge?" The house is not designated under heritage conservation rules, Mr. Caswell says, but it's well-preserved, with English and American influences in the architecture.
"It's always been a quite welllooked-after house," he says.
THE HOUSE TODAY Mr. Caswell and Mr. Gaetz slowly brought some modern comforts to the house while preserving the heritage elements such as an elegant, winding staircase and
original pine floors.
The house retains its period 12-over-12 windows and six-panel doors with Regency inset period knobs and locks. There are four wood-burning fireplaces, including one with an enameled stove insert.
During its days as an inn in the 1830s, Mr. Caswell says, slender slip rooms with beds were tucked in behind the public areas that accommodated diners and drinkers.
Previous owners reconfigured some of the interior to create a more traditional layout of living and dining rooms, Mr. Caswell says.
"At some point they took out the slip rooms and created big rooms," he says.
Over the years, he believes previous owners operated a small bed and breakfast inn.
Today the house has three bedrooms and three full bathrooms in 3,200 square feet of living space.
The ceilings are nine-feet high on the ground floor and nearly 10-feet high on the second floor.
An addition at the rear of the house holds the kitchen, which was charming but dated when the couple purchased it.
"It had three or four layers of old floors," Mr. Caswell says.
Mr. Caswell and Mr. Gaetz tore out the previous owners' cabinets and hired a designer to create a simple white kitchen with a beamed ceiling, lower cabinets, open upper shelves, stainless steel appliances and a large island topped in quartz.
Rear stairs likely rose to servants' quarters in the past. Today they lead to a family room and full bathroom above the kitchen.
Upstairs, the master bedroom has an ensuite bathroom and a fireplace. There are two additional bedrooms and a bathroom.
Outside, the kitchen is surrounded by a charming glassedin porch.
"We live out there in the summer," Mr. Caswell says. "You feel like you're part of the garden."
There's also an east-facing stone patio next to the house and a long-standing silver maple with a huge trunk and low-slung branches.
"If three or four people linked arms, you could get your arms around it," Mr. Caswell says. "I think it's nestled in there. It doesn't seem to catch the wind."
Mr. Caswell says the interior makes a fine setting for the couple's collection of furniture and art.
During his time in the antiques business, Mr. Caswell purchased a set of drapes that once hung in the William Mellis Christie mansion on Queen's Park Crescent in Toronto. The chocolate brown chinoiserie fabric displays fanciful scenes of pagodas. For years, he kept the drapes tucked away because he didn't have a room with windows that could hold them. Now they hang in one of the home's bedrooms.
"It's a great backdrop. You could display anything here," he says.
These days Mr. Caswell is a real estate agent with Bosley Real Estate Ltd. He still maintains a presence in the antiques business in Grafton with a small collection called The Curio.
"Once you're in that antiques world, it's hard to get out of it," he says.
The Quebec log cabin still stands on the property and could be used as a studio or home office, he points out.
The house and grounds have been included in the Architectural Conservancy's house tour in the area.
Mr. Caswell says the location is quiet but not remote, with Lake Ontario about 10 minutes to the south, and Cobourg about 15 minutes away. That town has a train station with rail service to Toronto.
The restaurants and wineries of Prince Edward County and the beaches of Presqu'ile Provincial Park are nearby.
THE BEST FEATURE The seven acres of grounds include woods and gardens in an undulating landscape.
Behind the log cabin is a spring-fed pond and two small streams converge on the property.
There is a second access road to the property from Brimley Road to the east.
"I call it the farmer's lane," Mr. Caswell says. "If you have a big event, you can park 20 or 30 cars there."

Vancouver buys hotel to help tackle housing crisis

Full text: The City of Vancouver has bought a 65room hotel on Kingsway for almost $25.5million - half the money it was allocated by the federal government's rapid-housing initiative aimed at helping pandemichit cities get homeless people into lowcost rooms and apartments by the end of the year.
Vancouver Mayor Kennedy Stewart said the purchase, combined with B.C. Housing Minister David Eby's announcement last week that the province has identified two new shelter spaces with a total of 120 spots for homeless people, makes him hopeful about housing progress in the city.
"Last year, this was a fantasy. Now it has hit the ground," said Mr. Stewart, who announced the Days Inn purchase Monday.
The mayor and federal Housing Minister Ahmed Hussen did not reveal the price of the Days Inn in the announcement.
However, documents obtained by The Globe and Mail show the city paid almost $19-million for the main parcel, which is currently valued at about $12-million by the province's assessment authority, and $3.2-million apiece for smaller ones adjoining. The property has been owned for more than a decade by a corporation directed by Bilkis and Riyaz Hussein.
Mr. Stewart said the purchase, along with more to come, will mean Vancouver can stop lurching from crisis to crisis and move to a more coherent way of tackling homelessness and lack of cheap housing in the city.
That hope is shared by residents who live near the east-side Vancouver park that has been home to about 200 people living in tents since last June, a phenomenon that has generated a wave of complaints about public disorder and crime nearby.
"People are very cautiously optimistic," said Jamie Maclaren, a Strathcona neighbourhood resident who has been involved in community lobbying for housing for the campers, along with a return of the park for use by the whole neighbourhood.
"It's good to see this incremental progress."
The city and province are working to clear Strathcona Park by moving people to indoor housing and to provide long-term housing solutions for the more than 2,000 homeless people in shelters and the streets outside the park.
Mr. Maclaren said that while he is hopeful about Mr. Eby's promise of a humane decampment of the park by April 30, he is concerned the hotel purchase may encourage more people to start living there in the meantime to give themselves a shot at a room when the hotel opens.
Mr. Stewart has said the hotel will be ready for occupation in November, after renovations. Mr. Maclaren worries that might also encourage some people to continue camping during the summer in local parks while they wait.
That could be the case, he said, for people who decide they don't want to live at the two shelters that the province and city plan to open for them in April.
Those shelters include the former Army & Navy department store on East Hastings Street, which will house 60 people, and a city-owned industrial site on Terminal Avenue near the railway station, which the city plans to renovate with $1.8-million to provide another 60 spaces.
The province rejected the previously proposed idea of using the Jericho Hostel as a shelter, saying the west-side building was too far from any services and would cost too much to renovate for the number of spaces it could provide.
Mr. Stewart said the city and province are still looking at whether the city-owned 2400 Motel, also on Kingsway, would be a suitable housing site, too.
As well, Vancouver's real estate department is searching for more buildings it can buy with the remaining half of the $51.5million that the federal government allocated through the rapid-housing initiative.
The city has also committed $30-million of its own money to housing initiatives.
Mr. Stewart said the department had been close to acquiring some other buildings, but owners jacked up the prices when they knew it was the city buying.
That won't work with the rules set by the federal government for the housing program, he said. There is a cap on the amount any city can pay per unit. Vancouver is required to come up with 135 units in total for the money it is getting.

Full text: 16 Inglewood Dr.
HAMILTON Asking Price: $2,297,000 Taxes: $11,695 (2020) Lot Size: 75 feet by 144 feet Agent: Stella McCollum, Sotheby's International Realty Canada THE BACKSTORY It's not easy to find 16 Inglewood Dr. A GPS map tool would deliver you to the right street address but, unlike some of the mansions in Hamilton's Durand neighbourhood, it doesn't loom over the street. This house is below the grade of the road and a set of steps takes you down to the front door.
Looking down from the sidewalk, it is something to behold.
With its flat roof and stark white stucco over concrete walls, it manages to be both rectilinear and curvy, almost like a grand ship (in fact the style is called paquebot in France, literally, ocean liner). Classified as art moderne architecture in Ontario, or sometimes streamline modern, it was once a popular form for commercial buildings. It is rare to find a residential home made this way.
The home was built in 1935 for Vernon Hale by local architects William Souter and Gordon Hutton.
"I posted it on my socials and this is the most amount of likes I've ever had," listing agent Stella McCollum said. "‘OMG the Hale House!' It's a house that people know."
"This pocket is very special, these are the houses of the old bosses who ran the factories in town. They are some of the older housing stock in Hamilton."
Larry Holzheu, an HVAC technician, visited the house on a service call about two decades ago and told the owner, "I'm going to take good care of the furnace, because this is going to be my house one day," a quip over which the two shared a good laugh. In 2017, Mr. Holzheu and partner Terry Venerus made good on the pledge and purchased the house. Their goal was to modernize its amenities, while not losing its historic character.
That, they were soon to discover, was not an easy task.
"The house was in incredibly good shape, but it had not been updated in the least," Mr. Holzheu said. For instance, rooms would often have only one electrical receptacle. The windows, replaced at some point in the previous 80 years, were falling apart and were found to be almost four inches smaller than the originals thanks to extra trim. Some of the floors had the original 1936 linoleum (huge sheets of the stuff, made with linseed oil) but the colour, while period appropriate, was a minty green that would jar a contemporary sense of taste.
"We're not nuts enough to do a perfect historical restoration; we took some liberties," Mr. Holzheu said. "When we think of 1930s, everything is taupe and black and white; the original exterior was pale green with dark green windows. The walls in the kitchens and bathrooms were canary yellow and the cabinets were blood red."
Nevertheless, very little of the internal or external structure has been changed. The new colour palette is a nod to the past but tones down the boldness considerably. "If you stay true to the architecture, it's a better investment," Mr. Holzheu said.
THE HOUSE TODAY The front entrance (which homeowners are unlikely to use, since the two-car garage on the back of the house is accessible from Aberdeen Avenue) is under a flat awning that floats off the curving wall to the right of the doorway.
Inside, a small vestibule opens to the front hall, on the left is a guest powder room and on the right is the curving stairwell done in sand-coloured terrazzo. A long window follows the stairwell upstairs, and inner and outer front doors are mainly glass as well.
Directly ahead is a large living room with original parquet floor and a wood-burning sandstone fireplace (that had to be rescued from many layers of paint, including some 70s-era turquoise).
The shape of the chimney travels up the wall, and then across the ceiling and down the opposite wall to frame a double-French door onto a rear terrace. Set into this arch is what looks like a grated vent, but is actually a long rectangular light fixture (original) filled with tubes of glass that add a warm glow to the room.
"It is incredible; mathematically perfect," said Mr. Holzheu, who says Hale House was built to the ideal "a house is a machine for living." The term was coined by modernist master CharlesÉdouard Jeanneret, better known as Le Corbusier, in his 1920 book Toward an Architecture. The second part of the famous tag is "beauty in the sense of good proportion," which the house has in spades.
To the right, through a set of pocket doors is a formal dining room, with another set of double doors onto the terrace, and an entrance to the kitchen.
The kitchen has been entirely redone with blonde wood cabinets (with some high, narrow uppers), a basket weave-patterned tile floor and dark stone countertops. At the edges of the counter runs are some open rounded shelves that borrow art modern flourishes, so too does the sweeping curve of the stove hood. An L-shaped peninsula creates a breakfast bar behind which is a floor-to-ceiling glass display cabinet filled with vintage crystal and china. There's more pantry storage beside.
Just next to the kitchen is a den, with original wood-paneled walls, and beyond that the stairwell.
There were four bedrooms in two wings upstairs in the original configuration. They could be closed off with doors at the end of the short hallway. Currently, it's more like two suites: One for the primary bedroom and one for a guest suite. In the guest wing a three-piece bath sits in between the two bedrooms, one of which is now an upstairs lounge or TV room. The floors here are original chevron-style parquet.
The primary suite is significantly bigger, about the same size as the downstairs living room, with a massive wooden feature wall (with inset television) that curves at the corners.
The fourth bedroom was converted completely to a walk-in closet and dressing room.
The primary bathroom has a huge shower tiled in white and grey marble with a solid threequarter-wall enclosure (not glass as is current today) but the tiles in both bathrooms do not extend to the ceiling, and it was a fight to keep them that way.
"We just pulled out our hair sometimes trying to get people to do what we wanted," Mr. Holzheu said. "The tilers are looking at you like you've got four heads ... even the [black and white checkerboard] patterns on the floor, they'd say, ‘That's old fashioned.' Yes! You're in a 1935 house!"
The walls are painted an olive green, chosen to reflect the original palette. "The original porcelain tile in the ensuite was that colour," said Mr. Holzheu, same too of the other bathroom on this level, the blue wall paint matches its original tile colour.
But it's not just cosmetic. "We have heated towel racks, heated floors, electrical outlets in the medicine cabinets so we can charge razors [or phones] so you don't see them on the counter," Mr. Holzheu said. He's seen a lot of homes in his 30-year career, and he's learned a few tricks of the trade. "I added a third return line for hot water. Anywhere there's a sink it has a motion sensor, and when you walk in it turns on a pump, and the tap has instant hot water." These kind of return pumps are common in apartment buildings; a residential home, not so much.
FAVOURITE SPACE Mr. Holzheu's favourite space is the den next to the kitchen. "This is where the man of the house would go and light a little fire in the fireplace, read The Wall Street Journal," Mr. Holzheu said.
"People talk about a man-cave; I go in there watch an old movie and have a cup of tea. It's such a nice warm, calming room." It's also almost entirely intact; the wood panelling on the walls is original.
The lower level is also fairly original, but is relatively unfinished.
There are two more potential bedrooms, as well as laundry and a possible media room or entertaining space with a walkout to the lower yard. This was where the couple both ran out of steam on renovations. But they have decided to make a virtue of that by letting the next buyers put their stamp on a space.
"We are at the top of the price range in Hamilton," said Ms. McCollum, but she argues there's a virtue in that as well. "This would be a $5-million house in Toronto."
That may be conservative, as Mr. Holzheu discovered when changing plumbing and electrical. The structure of the house is almost absurdly overbuilt and it's impossible to imagine how much it would cost in materials alone today.
"There are steel I-beams every four feet," Mr. Holzheu said.
"There's no wood; it's all steel and reinforced concrete. There's four inches of cork insulation in the walls."

Full text: Metro Vancouver housing builders and the real estate industry are bracing for a big surge of immigrants to wash into the region once travel is allowed again, with some possible extra pushes coming from Hong Kong, India, the Philippines and even Indonesia.
That new wave is likely to include a significant proportion of relatively well-off, middle-class people with assets to bring to Canada that will give them home-buying power when they get here.
"A lot of would-be immigrants are preplanning," said Vishey Singh, a realtor with Team 3000 who sells primarily in the southern suburbs of Surrey, Delta and Langley, where house prices have been shooting up in recent months.
"The Indian investors and immigrants are following the exact same path as the Chinese 10 years ago," said Mr. Singh, whose most recent trip to India before the pandemic was to speak to 150 interested investors and immigrants in New Delhi. "And the Filipino and Indonesian ones, they are not far behind."
He and many others say the increasing numbers of those new, middle-class immigrants, combined with pent-up demand from those prevented from moving to a new country because of pandemic restrictions along with Canada's aggressive new federal targets for immigration, will produce even more pressure on local housing.
"They don't like to rent for very long. They'll pool resources to buy," said Michael Ferreira, whose Vancouver-based company Urban Analytics tracks new building and forecasts real estate trends. Mr. Ferreira said that, while builders are starting to roll out new projects this spring for what they expect to be increased demand over the next couple of years, it's unclear whether city governments are equally prepared.
"Is anybody telling the municipal planning departments what's happening?" he wondered. "Because their projections can't be based on historic growth rates."
The federal government has increased its immigration targets for the next three years, upping them from the previous goal of slightly more than one million for 2020-2022 to 1.233 million for 2021-2023.
Although Canada admitted only 185,000 immigrants last year during the pandemic slowdown, compared with 340,000 in 2019, the Immigration Minister has recently said it is on target to admit 400,000 in 2021.
In the past three years, B.C.
typically saw 60,000 new immigrants a year arrive in the province. While the top country of origin was China 10 years ago, that's been replaced by India.
The Lower Mainland, which receives the bulk of new arrivals from both inside and outside Canada, is likely to be affected by political or demographic changes in particular countries, such as China, India and the Philippines.
Many are trying to understand how the political turmoil in Hong Kong, where more than 300,000 residents hold Canadian passports, will play out in the immigration picture of the next few years.
The former British colony has been rocked by protests, especially by younger people, over China's increasing control over democratic processes and civil rights, starting with what was called the Umbrella Movement in 2014.
They are wondering how many people there might be like Jenny Liu, who grew up in Vancouver after her parents immigrated in the 1990s, worked in Hong Kong and the U.S. for 20 years and then decided five years ago to come back to Vancouver.
"Politics was the immediate factor to accelerate the move back to Vancouver," said Ms. Liu, who works in human resources.
Among her friends, "I know some already moved back [to Canada] because of the Umbrella Movement. Some to Toronto, especially last year, late 2019, because of the protests."
Some real estate experts say they believe the impact of people from Hong Kong moving to the region will be muted, nothing like the Vancouver-altering boom of the 1990s.
"The ones with Canadian passports are wealthy and they already have a beachhead here or in Toronto. The impact is going to be less than in 1997," said Dan Scarrow, the president of Macdonald Realty. Mr. Scarrow and his company have developed expertise in China, and he moved there for several years because of the real estate demand.
"There is still going to be an impact on the market but it will be very subtle."
A University of B.C. professor who has been studying exactly this demographic is also seeing signs that the Hong Kong effect won't be the same as it was in the 1990s.
"This won't be a huge jump.
The impact will be two or three years from now," said Miu Chung Yan, a professor of social work who has been interviewing recent Hong Kong returnees.
He is expecting that there will be three types of Hong Kong residents who come to Canada in the next several years.
The first group is the Canadian passport holders, of which about 50,000 will likely slowly shift back to Canada over the next five years. (About 20,000 of those are likely to come to the Vancouver region.) They may buy homes or reoccupy places they have been renting out, which will produce ripple effects.
The second is regular immigrants, likely to be a small group because those people will have multiple choices, including going to Britain, which has offered passports to residents who have pre-1997 roots. The third is those coming on an open work permit, which Prof. Yan also says won't be large.
Those in real estate say that, for the most part, those people aren't buying huge amounts of property yet. But local investors who expect that the new wave of immigrants will be arriving soon are bidding up properties, they say, with the expectation they'll make a profit when those newcomers arrive and buy. The proportion of investors completing sales has risen to 20 per cent instead of the usual 10 per cent, some Surrey realtors say.
"There is the anticipation of the migration from India," said Jag Sidhu, a realtor specializing in Surrey. "People are thinking what happens next year with the vaccines done. You are going to get that mass migration. People are positioning themselves."

DESIGNING ADUs: FROM ‘GRANNY FLATS' TO ARCHITECTURAL ARTISTRY

Full text: At a conference in Portland in 2019, planners, contractors and architects put their heads together to develop new ideas and typologies for accessory dwelling units, which states such as California and Oregon increasingly view as an integral way of adding density to residential neighbourhoods that have become the exclusive preserve of homeowners. Portland, in fact, has seen a proliferation of architectural interpretations of ADUs, from those with sustainability features to others that stress accessibility.
As The New York Times noted of Portland's "small house movement," a local ADU project in 2016 won a prestigious American Institute of Architects award - high praise for dwellings once described as "granny flats."
But design and garden suites don't necessarily go hand-inglove.
In both Toronto and Calgary, fairly prescriptive design guidelines have produced somewhat formulaic projects. Studio North's Mark Erickson notes that these policies came into effect a few years ago when Calgary's city council approved a blanket rezoning allowing ADUs. The guidelines were meant to halt outsized and unpopular projects "extruded" from the tops of garages. But, he says, the absence of guidelines also permitted more design flexibility.
Given that these projects cost about $300,000 to $350,000, most homeowners opt for an off-the-rack look instead of more distinctive, and therefore costly, architecture.
"The design guidelines have really set a standard," says Mr. Erickson, whose firm prefers more innovative approaches.
"But it means the laneway houses look very similar."

Full text: Canada's housing agency raised concerns about rapidly rising mortgage debt, as the work-from-home trend increases competition for larger properties and drives up house prices in suburbs and beyond.
Household mortgage debt is growing at its fastest pace since the country emerged from the Great Recession, with homeowners taking advantage of ultralow borrowing costs. It hit $1.67-trillion in December, a 7.6-per-cent increase over the year.
Although Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. said it is likely that higher-income households have been pushing up prices, the housing agency said there were risks that they would not be able to support their debt.
"That is what we are concerned about.
Debt levels have continued to go up," CMHC's deputy chief economist Aled ab Iorwerth said on a call with reporters to discuss the housing market. "It may be that the housing market is driven more by higher-income households and they may be able to sustain that [debt], but it remains true that it continues to increase.
There is a little bit of concern there," he said.
He made the comments in the same week that Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem said the central bank was "acutely aware" that in a low interest rate world there was a risk that households can get stretched.
The pandemic's stay-at-home requirement has been a major reason homebuyers sought bigger properties with more green space outside of the city. However, no one knows whether companies will eventually require their staff to return to their city offices when the pandemic ends.
"We don't know how permanent this is," Mr. ab Iorwerth said.
"Will businesses expect people to show up for their physical place of work or will they allow people to come in once or twice a week?" Some businesses have already decided to make remote work permanent or downsize to smaller offices in the suburbs. But many companies have not made the decision, and if businesses require staff to physically return to the downtown core, homeowners unable to do the longer commutes could lose their higher-paid jobs.
"That is one uncertainty. When you have this dynamic playing out when people are already heavily indebted, that makes the whole community vulnerable to more shocks," Mr. ab Iorwerth said.
Over all, household finances have improved with homeowners paying down other types of debt such as credit cards and personal loans.
Although the cost of servicing debt has declined because of the low interest rates, the easy money is driving up mortgage debt and housing prices.
Mr. Macklem said the central bank is "starting to see some early signs of excess exuberance" in the housing market, although he added that the country was a long way from 2016 and 2017, when, he said, the market was really hot.
"When we see people starting to buy houses solely because they think the prices are going to go up, that is a warning sign for us," he said at a virtual industry event on Tuesday.
CMHC is due to release a new forecast soon. Last year, after the lockdowns briefly hammered home resales and prices, CMHC predicted the average selling price could drop as much as 18 per cent in the worst-case scenario.
Mr. ab Iorwerth said he expected the trend toward suburban and semi-rural houses to continue, although he did not expect the sharp rebound in sales and prices to remain at the same pace as last year's initial surge.
In Toronto, the average selling price of a detached house rose 16 per cent in the 12 months to January while climbing 37 per cent in the surrounding suburbs, according to the local real estate board.

Full text: Toronto developer Dream Unlimited Corp. has hired two urbanists previously affiliated with Sidewalk Labs to join its impactinvestment division, which is ramping up with the purchase of two office buildings in the city's west end this month.
The company said impact investment in the property sector places an emphasis on green buildings and affordable and inclusive housing and offices, all while gaining local support and ensuring that the supply chain draws from diverse sources.
Dream said Wednesday that Pino Di Mascio would become its head of strategy and delivery for the division. Mr. Di Mascio will leave his role as director of planning and delivery for Google sister company Sidewalk Labs, which spent two and a half years developing a plan to redevelop a portion of Toronto's waterfront for a community to test new urban technologies and building methods.
A former partner at the design and planning firm Urban Strategies, he was a key local Toronto hire for New York-based Sidewalk, which abandoned its Toronto plan in May, 2020, saying the COVID-19 pandemic had upended its business case.
Richard Florida, meanwhile, is set to become vice-chair of Dream's impact group. The University of Toronto School of Cities professor is the co-founder of the CityLab urban-affairs publication, founder of the Creative Class Group consultancy, and author of numerous books including 2002's The Rise of The Creative Class.
The book launched Mr. Florida into academic superstardom by prompting cities worldwide to reinvest in their cores, but was later met with accusations of accelerating gentrification, which Mr. Florida examined in the followup book, The New Urban Crisis.
Mr. Florida began advising Sidewalk in 2015, shortly after its inception, and was part of an advisory panel of local luminaries after it began working in Toronto.
Both men have long known Dream president Michael Cooper, who stressed that their hirings have nothing to do with trying to build a technology-laced community, as Sidewalk had hoped to do.
"Our focus isn't smart cities," said Mr. Cooper. "We will use technology to help make buildings greener, but we are not focused on the principle of smart cities."
This month, Dream spent $31.8-million for two low-rise office buildings on side streets near Trinity Bellwoods Park - one of downtown Toronto's highest-demand residential neighbourhoods, which has also become a destination for startups. Mr. Cooper said his company will be overhauling the buildings so they are more energy efficient and use less water, as well redesigning the ground floors to be more welcoming.
Mr. Di Mascio was one of just a handful of Toronto-based Sidewalk Labs staff to avoid being laid off last summer after the local project ended.
In an interview, Mr. Di Mascio said that he hoped to help Dream's portfolio go beyond traditional environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) investments and rethink how urban spaces are created in an inclusive, climate-positive way.
The pandemic has helped people better understand that cities need to better resolve issues around climate change and social inequities, Mr. Di Mascio said, adding that he recognized Dream wants to take a role in doing so.
"The real place I want to have my impact in is in bringing this to life," he said.
Mr. Florida did not respond to an interview request as of Wednesday afternoon.
Dream also owns property adjacent to the 4.8-hectare Quayside site where Sidewalk had planned to develop its community. Since that project ended, Waterfront Toronto, the government agency that manages the site, has said it would change direction for the area, putting greater emphasis on priorities such as affordable housing. Mr. Cooper, who along with other Canadian real estate companies had expressed interest in helping Sidewalk with the development, said there was no indication that Waterfront Toronto would be interested in smart cities.
On Wednesday, Waterfront Toronto also launched a new website for businesses to contact the agency about potentially participating in the new Quayside project in various capacities. A formal request-for-proposals is expected later this year.

Full text: Sex traffickers are using the country's major highway networks to transport women and girls, taking them to small towns and cities in order to isolate them, avoid police and maximize their financial gain, according to the first research in Canada analyzing how victims are moved.
A report from the Canadian Centre to End Human Trafficking identifies some of the key routes traffickers use to transport their victims, isolating them from family, friends and familiar surroundings that could offer an eventual escape, and making them wholly dependent on their perpetrators. The constant movement also allows criminals to avoid detection by law enforcement and gives them access to more profitable markets.
The research suggests there's a trend in young women being trafficked from Quebec to Alberta, where criminals can make more money selling sex services than in other provinces, according to police officers.
And sex trafficking is so prevalent across Canada that it occurs wherever "there is a highway and access to the internet," the report says.
"I think too many people believe that this is an issue that happens in other countries or that it's an issue of kidnapping and abduction," says Julia Drydyk, the Centre's executive director.
"And, really, it's far more commonplace."
To compile the report, the Centre reviewed academic reports and media coverage, and interviewed police officers and service providers to determine its findings. Most of the victims are women and girls, but the report notes a small number of respondents worked with male or trans-identified survivors. Interviewees said most victims and survivors they encountered were between the ages of 18 to 24, but ranged from 12 to 50.
In Alberta, shuttling victims between Calgary, Edmonton, Fort McMurray and Grande Prairie allows sex traffickers to find plenty of willing customers near oil patch work camps, and exploit the province's online sex markets, too.
"A growing trend in this corridor is the number of victims and survivors from Quebec who speak little to no English," according to the report. "Not only do language barriers serve as another method of control, but it is also believed that sex buyers see women from Quebec as exotic and novel."
Another well-worn route has perpetrators taking victims from Halifax to Moncton.
Corporal David Lane, the RCMP's human-trafficking co-ordinator in Nova Scotia, says the province is well known in the criminal and policing world for exporting victims of human trafficking. (Data published by Statistics Canada in June shows that Nova Scotia and Ontario have higher rates of human trafficking than the national average, citing figures from 2009 to 2018.) Some target women and girls from Nova Scotia because they can sell them the idea of giving them a better life, he said.
"If you're from a rural fishing village in Nova Scotia, and someone offers you to go to live next to the Air Canada Centre in Toronto, to go to Calgary or Vancouver, it would probably be pretty lucrative," Cpl. Lane says, "especially when you thought they were someone you loved."
That appears to be a common thread among trafficking victims, according to the report: They often know their abusers. It might even be someone they loved or trusted, such as a boyfriend, a family member or friend.
Detective-Sergeant David Correa is in charge of Toronto Police's human-trafficking enforcement unit. Cases concerning victims from Northern Ontario, Quebec and Atlantic Canada routinely land on his desk. Most of them have been recruited by young men on social media, he says.
His job is to investigate the crimes but also to support the victims, who face enormous pressure to testify in court. Det. Sgt. Correa's unit gathers evidence such as video surveillance to help support their cases. He says his unit will also help victims return to their home city or province.
Many victims are hauled across the country along the TransCanada and 401 highways, which are both notorious for sex trafficking.
Ms. Drydyk says perpetrators stop at all the large urban centres along the way to make more profit.
"They can use cars to travel really quickly between cities, and they can change their rental car in between those areas to avoid law enforcement detection," she says.
Two other popular thoroughfares for traffickers are Ontario's highways 11 and 17, used to move victims from Sudbury and Thunder Bay through Northern Ontario and onward to Winnipeg. Ms. Drydyk says they view the remoteness of these highways as yet another way to avoid the police.
All that moving around can certainly make it challenging to track their movements. "They're gonna stay in a given hotel, probably a maximum of three days, before they start really bringing attention to themselves," Det. Sgt. Correa says.
Police also face the challenge of getting victims to trust them. They can be reluctant to speak to police because they may have had a bad experience in the past, or their trafficker has forced them to commit fraud or recruit other girls.
Karly Church is a human trafficking crisis-intervention counsellor who works with Victim Services of Durham Region and is embedded with Durham Police's human trafficking unit. She's also a survivor of sex trafficking who provides informal counselling and helps connect victims and survivors to services.
When police meet a victim, she often accompanies them to let them know she can help if they don't want to talk to law enforcement. "I'd say every single time, the individual at least takes my phone number," she says.
Sex trafficking doesn't always involve moving victims around the country. A lot of Ms. Church's younger clients were lured by traffickers at school. Sometimes it's a fellow student or someone they met at a party or on social media.
"A lot of them who are under the age of 18, they go to school Monday to Friday, they come home after school, say they're going to a friend's house, and then they're made to work by their trafficker."
The Centre's report makes recommendations based on its findings, including investing in more interjurisdictional law enforcement teams and mandatory training for all levels of law enforcement. It urges finding ways to make the legal process less traumatizing for survivors, and encourages stronger partnerships between governments and organizations that work with survivors - as well as sectors used by traffickers, such as hotels and rental car companies.
"We implore all levels of government to work together on this issue and commit to funding anti-human-trafficking initiatives in perpetuity to ensure that programs and services can focus on what matters most: providing exceptional, meaningful and effective supports to victims and survivors," the report reads.
Nova Scotia and Ontario have higher rates of human trafficking than the national average, with women and girls often lured by people close to them or over social media. Their traffickers then force them across the country. The Globe and Mail spoke with two women who shared their personal experiences being sex trafficked and a third woman who shares her daughter's story.
VANESSA TYNES-JASS Vanessa Tynes-Jass was a 17-year-old straight-A student when she met the first man who trafficked her.
At the time - three decades ago - she was living in a rooming house in Dartmouth. A group of girls lived in the back of the house, and Ms. Tynes-Jass used to watch them put on makeup and go out at night. But she was busy with school and her job at McDonald's, and didn't think too much about what they were doing.
The girls started inviting her on shopping trips and to restaurants, telling her not to worry about paying because the owner of the house covered the bills. It turned out the man - who lived there with his family - was a pimp. After a few weeks of shopping trips, he told Ms. Tynes-Jass she couldn't stay unless she did what the other girls did.
She remembers asking, "What's that?" That night, she says, "they did me up and took me out, and I got turned out that night. So that's the beginning of it."
Over the course of 18 months, Ms. Tynes-Jass was trafficked by three different men and raped over and over again. She tried repeatedly to escape, but she wasn't allowed to keep any money, and her
pimps monitored her every move. She felt detached from her head and her heart, numbing herself to cope with the trauma.
The first time she hatched a plan to escape, her roommate went missing, so instead of making a run for it, Ms. Tynes-Jass went searching for her. The next morning, she heard on the radio that a body had been found in a garbage can. She went to the morgue and still remembers staring into her friend's face.
That night, her pimp made her stand in the same spot her friend who was killed had worked the night before.
She was working up the courage to escape again when she was recruited by a group of girls who promised her their pimp would protect her. Instead, he put her in the backseat of a car and took her to Montreal.
Ms. Tynes-Jass's anxiety swelled as they passed swaths of dense forest, taking her farther away from home. She knew of other girls who'd been taken and never returned.
"I had no say in the decision," she says. "I had no say whatsoever."
In desperation, she jumped out of the car before they reached Montreal and ran to a payphone to call police. But her freedom was fleeting.
She fell into the grips of a third man who sent her all over the country, making her stay with his family members or people he knew, so she was always watched.
"They would just trade girls," Ms. Tynes-Jass says. "It's like you're a thing. You're nothing to them. ... They try to get you pregnant so you're tied to them, so you can't leave. You're like a slave."
After hiding enough money to buy her freedom, Ms. Tynes-Jass rented an apartment in Dartmouth. She remembers lying on the floor, thinking she was free. But the pimp and his friends found her and beat her so badly she thought she was going to die.
"They were kicking me in the head and the stomach, and I was telling myself, ‘You can't pass out.' They put me in a basement, and I got raped that night."
She managed to escape again, taking a bus to her hometown of Truro. But when she arrived, the pimp was waiting for her in the parking lot. She refused to get off the bus until someone came to help - armed with a baseball bat.
After she was finally free for good, Ms. Tynes-Jass became pregnant and had a son. She returned to high school at the age of 20, secured a scholarship to Dalhousie University and went on to become a lawyer. She wanted to reach for a career that was beyond her wildest dreams, and strived to take care of her son.
She got married and started practising law in Halifax. But she was constantly reminded of what had happened to her in Nova Scotia.
She now lives in Toronto with her family, where she runs a practice focused on family law and residential real estate. She also operates a charity called Survivors Unleashed International, which provides education funding to victims of trafficking.
Ms. Tynes-Jass says governments, schools and parents need to acknowledge the threat of sex trafficking and talk more about how girls are coerced.
"The real issue is these little girls are looking for love, and these pimps are exploiting that for their own greed and financial gain," she says. "But they're ruining lives in the process."
JENNIFER HOLLEMAN Jennifer Holleman can never forget the moment she found out her 21-year-old daughter, Maddison Fraser, was dead.
It was July 8, 2015 - a Wednesday. Ms. Holleman and her thenpartner were camping in Annapolis Royal, in western Nova Scotia.
Her partner's phone rang, and he quickly passed it to Ms. Holleman.
It was her other daughter, who had grim news to deliver: Maddison, who had a three-year-old child, was riding in a vehicle with a man believed to have purchased her for sexual services. Around 2:15 a.m., the driver lost control and the car flipped, smashing into an apartment building. Both Maddison and the driver died.
"I just dropped in the trailer," Ms. Holleman says.
Maddison was 19 when she moved to Grand Prairie, Alta., along with her baby and a friend her mother thought was a bad influence.
Soon, Ms. Holleman started receiving photos sent by concerned friends - one of Maddison advertised on a website for sexual services, another of Maddison beaten so badly, her own mother didn't recognize her. Ms. Holleman tried talking to her daughter, but the more questions she asked, the more Maddison pushed her away.
Ms. Holleman has since learned that Maddison was sex-trafficked across Alberta and Ontario for roughly two-and-a-half years before her death. In the time since, she has tried to piece together what happened to her girl. She knows her daughter's perpetrators controlled her with violence and took away her ID. They even prevented Maddison from tending to her baby, and in May, 2013, Ms. Holleman travelled to Alberta to pick up her grandchild and bring her back to Nova Scotia.
"I don't know how Maddison lived as long as she did," Ms. Holleman says through tears. "That's probably one of the hardest things for me to say. Because they just put her through hell."
After Maddison's death, Ms. Holleman went through her phone. It held what she thought was an important clue: a voice message her daughter sent to a friend, naming men who attacked her. On the recording, Maddison can be heard saying the men beat her badly, burned her with cigarettes and lit her hair on fire.
Maddison's medical records - which Ms. Holleman fought to access - confirmed that and more: She had been raped multiple times, and had multiple contusions and bruised ribs. She'd had seven abortions in less than three years.
According to doctors' notes, they asked Maddison if she wanted to contact the RCMP. She declined.
The RCMP launched an investigation into the assault in August, 2015, a month after Maddison's death. Corporal Deanna Fontaine, a media relations officer with Western Alberta District RCMP, told The Globe the investigation involved following up on information provided by Ms. Holleman.
By 2018, Cpl. Fontaine says the RCMP had exhausted all investigative avenues. Two reviews of the evidence concluded there were insufficient grounds to support charges, though she says the RCMP identified "a number of subjects of interest." The investigation remains open.
Today Maddison's daughter is 9, and though she now lives with her father, he and Ms. Holleman share joint custody.
"She's going to have a happy life, and I don't care what I have to do to make the majority of it roses and butterflies," Ms. Holleman says.
"That's the way it's going to be." CAROLINE PUGH-ROBERTS Caroline Pugh-Roberts often wakes up to texts in the middle of the night from unknown numbers with the simple words: "I heard you could help me."
Ms. Pugh-Roberts works at the Salvation Army in London, Ont., where she runs a program for people who have been, or are at risk of being, trafficked. That includes providing food and support and, most crucially, help escaping their abusers.
Drive by any hotel in London, according to Ms. Pugh-Roberts, and it's likely someone is being forced to perform sex work there. "It's that bad," she says. The London Abused Women's Centre says it provided support to 1,342 prostituted, trafficked and sexually exploited women and girls in its 2019-2020 fiscal year. Ms. Pugh-Roberts attributes London's trafficking problem to its location along Ontario's 401 highway.
Many of the victims who reach out for help find her through word of mouth, she says, "because ... I have street cred, for lack of a better way of putting it."
Ms. Pugh-Roberts was trafficked for eight years. She was 35 when she met her trafficker - her boyfriend - in London. She'd recently lost her husband, mother and two best friends, and she was vulnerable.
He promised to take care of her.
But when they were confronted with being evicted from their apartment, her boyfriend turned on her, she says, and forced her into the sex trade. He told her she had to take care of "the family."
He trafficked her in hotels, strip clubs, massage parlours and parks from Sarnia, Ont., to Toronto, with stops in cities and towns along the 401, including small centres like Princeton, outside of Woodstock.
Ms. Pugh-Roberts lived in and out of shelters before she was finally able to escape.
She has never reported her perpetrators because they were associated with organized crime.
Now her mission is to help others. Ms. Pugh-Roberts says the victim stories she has heard through the pandemic have changed.
She hears from a lot of girls - some as young as 12 - and increasingly they're being trafficked by their families.
She points to one young woman in particular, whom she met this past spring at a local park. (It's been harder to meet victims in relative privacy during COVID-19, with regular meeting places closed.)
The pair sat across from each other on a blanket. The 21-year-old victim had dark circles around her eyes and red marks on her neck, Ms. Pugh-Roberts says. "She was limp.
Her body was just slumped. You could see the dejection, the hopelessness and the despondency. It was so visible."
When speaking to victims, Ms. Pugh-Roberts says she never uses the term "trafficking" - that's just not the kind of language victims use. Instead, she asked the young woman if someone was hurting her. The answer was yes - she told Ms. Pugh-Roberts her boyfriend was forcing her to perform sex acts both in person and via webcam.
During online sessions, he would stand on the sidelines, telling her what to do.
When a purchaser told her to strangle herself with a tie, she pretended to pass out. Her boyfriend insisted she strangle herself until she was unconscious.
Ms. Pugh-Roberts says that young woman has not been able to escape her abuser.
She understands just how difficult it can be - it took Ms. PughRoberts several attempts before she finally got away from her trafficker. "People say, ‘Why didn't you leave?'" she says.
"Oh, my god, there are so many barriers."
What those people should be asking instead is why men continue to do this to women and what can be done to stop them.
"The onus is always on the victim," she says.
"It has to stop."

Developer's $1-million donation to Vancouver police charity raises alarm

Full text: A local real estate developer has donated $1-million to the Vancouver Police Department's charity foundation to increase policing in and around the Downtown Eastside, an area he says the city has failed with its misguided approach to drug use and homelessness.
But critics say such private bumps to police funding, which are common in bigger American cities and are increasing in Canada, prioritize the interests of the wealthy and come as municipalities across the country grapple with calls to put less - not more - money in the hands of police in favour of more services for those battling mental-health issues, homelessness and substance use.
Peter Wall, founder of the publicly traded Wall Financial Corp.
and one of Vancouver's most prominent political donors, says he recently made the five-year commitment to the Vancouver Police Foundation to help address the spike in fatal opioid poisonings and rise in homelessness that have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The charity funds programs run by officers and buys special equipment for officers each year, all outside of the annual operating budget of the policing agency.
Mr. Wall, whose buildings dot Vancouver's skyline, declined an interview request from The Globe and Mail, but sent a small map of the area he deems problematic and a detailed statement that explained his donation while casting shade on the city's response to these twin crises.
"Vancouver's current city officials' answer to the homeless problem for the people on the Downtown Eastside is to buy up or rent dilapidated old hotels that are rodent-infested and lack proper plumbing and heating, and their answer to mental health and addiction problems is to open more injection sites throughout the city where adults and youth can bring their contraband drugs which kill them," he wrote.
Each year, $100,000 of Mr. Wall's money will go toward five community policing centres located in and around the neighbourhood. Four of these outposts are overseen by non-profit boards that direct volunteers to prevent crime in co-operation with actual officers, while the VPD runs and funds the fifth, near the Granville Street entertainment district.
The other $100,000 in annual funding will be granted to various projects that "provide additional resources to VPD officers who are dealing with individuals in crisis due to mental health or addiction issues," according to the police foundation's executive director Andrea Wright. As an example of what types of projects may receive this funding, Ms. Wright pointed to a special centre in downtown Vancouver's St. Paul's Hospital that was created to help reduce the amount of time officers were waiting in the emergency room with people they arrested under the provincial Mental Health Act.
Kevin Walby, a criminology professor at the University of Winnipeg and an expert on North American police foundations, said Mr. Wall's largesse is part of a concerning trend in Canadian policing that has long caught on in the United States, where most mid-sized and larger cities see corporations and the wealthiest locals donate millions each year to charity arms of the local department. In Calgary, he said, a host of oil companies has donated millions to the local police foundation, raising questions about whether police give more attention to areas around corporate property.
Prof. Walby said Mr. Wall's donation is more problematic because he is directly requesting more policing of the Downtown Eastside, even if it is through the volunteer-run community policing centres. He said everyone wants their neighbourhoods to be safer, but putting more money toward securing the Downtown Eastside through law enforcement has failed to achieve this goal over the past decades.
"There's no police agency in Canada that can stand up and say ‘Hey, we've been boosting security, boosting patrols, boosting criminalization and guess what?
We've taken the crime rate down to zero,' "Prof. Walby said. "Donating directly to grassroots community and social development agencies, donating directly to the people who live and work in that community and letting them decide how to use the funds would be a way more insightful and mature way of approaching this."
Mr. Wall's pledge represents a tenth of the $10-million the Vancouver Police Foundation says it has given out since its creation in 1976. The donation - like all foundation grants - falls outside the city's regular operating budget, which has devoted roughly a fifth of all spending on police services in recent years.
In December, city council narrowly passed a contentious $1.6billion budget that froze funding this year for policing to 2020 levels of nearly $341-million. VPD Chief Adam Palmer said he was concerned that decision will directly affect public safety and his department will end up with 61 fewer new recruits than planned this year.
Vancouver Mayor Kennedy Stewart says he appreciates Mr. Wall's philanthropy. But the mayor rejected the assertion that his city's social-housing units are sub-standard, noting Vancouver is working with Ottawa on a $1billion plan to buy up and revitalize older dorm-style hotels in the Downtown Eastside. He also denied that Vancouver's approach to addiction harm reduction is misguided, given science that shows this range of services such as supervised drug-use sites have saved countless lives.
"There's a great deal that's happening that Mr. Wall may not be aware of, and I welcome the chance to tell him more about it and hopefully get his help to move it along," Mr. Kennedy said in an e-mailed statement. "I am guided by science and by the best advice of medical experts."
Vancouver Councillor Jean Swanson said city staff are now working to provide a template for how to replace police with different community groups to solve problems involving homeless people, sex workers, drug users and those with mental-health crises.
Ms. Swanson, a long-time advocate for Downtown Eastside residents, agrees with Mr. Wall that the city has not done enough to provide proper housing for those at the margins of society, but she vehemently opposes his prescription for more policing in the area.
"I don't think it's right that private rich people should be making decisions that get police to do what they want."

Anita Anand's big shot: How she went from political novice to the PM's point person on vaccine supplies

Full text: Anita Anand came into politics out of nowhere in 2019.
She had been an elected MP for about two weeks when the phone rang in early November summoning her to an interview with Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's transition team. She wasn't told what Anne McLellan, a former deputy prime minister, was vetting her for. A position as a parliamentary secretary?
For Ms. Anand, not knowing was vexing. It didn't give her enough clues about how to get ready.
"I am the queen of preparation," she said in an interview. "I want you to know that I do not go anywhere without having prepared."
Among those who know her, there is a consensus about this.
Details-oriented, some call her.
Thorough. Opponents question her results but associates are unanimous about her approach.
She calls herself cautious, an analyzer of risks. Her sister Sonia remembered a childhood drama festival where she and the other actors enjoyed ad-libbing to throw off Anita, who stuck to her lines. She found it upsetting.
"We had practised the plan and we weren't executing the plan," Anita Anand recalled with a little smile.
Now Ms. Anand, 53, the Minister of Public Services and Procurement, finds herself responsible for executing a plan in a pandemic world full of script-changing chaos. She weighed the pros and cons of leaving her role as a respected law professor for a venture into politics. Now she is the minister responsible for buying COVID-19 vaccines.
Few ministers have ever been thrust into such life-or-death pressure. Certainly not a minister plucked from political obscurity less than 18 months ago. When Mr. Trudeau gave her a cabinet post, it was to oversee a workaday department with a usually low-profile role managing contracting for supplies. Now the survival of Mr. Trudeau's government may well hinge on vaccine supply.
And the plan? The public thinks it is going badly. Opinion polls show half the country doubts vaccines will arrive as promised. They blame Ottawa.
By mid-February, Canada had administered 3.5 doses per 100 people, behind most of Europe, far behind the U.S. and Britain.
Depending on the day, behind close to 40 countries. Scheduled deliveries had been reduced. The opposition Conservatives called it incompetence.
Ms. Anand's answer - and Mr. Trudeau's - is that there's a plan, and results are coming. The government bought a lot of doses, from a diversified "portfolio" of vaccine suppliers. Week-to-week deliveries have fluctuated with production issues, but the supplies were promised on a quarterly basis, and six million doses will still arrive by March 31.
She repeats that message in TV interviews and press conferences.
When pushed for details of vaccine contracts, she insists they are entirely covered by confidentiality clauses. Her answers often cite numbers, and can seem repetitive. Sometimes, she lectures like the professor she was; in an interview with CTV's Evan Solomon two weeks ago, she used the word "coterminous." Twice.
She is in her second wave of pandemic procurement crisis.
Ten months ago, she was getting reports when planes landed with N95 masks, and working with liquor distillers to switch to making hand sanitizer, and contracting for what turned out to be not too few, but too many mechanical ventilators.
"She's accessible. She's smart," said Goldy Hyder, the president of the Business Council of Canada, who got to know Ms. Anand during that first wave. "I'm respectful of someone in their first time in public life being thrust into a pivotal role. It's not like there's a playbook for handling this, in a department that the public service itself would probably call old and clunky. To make that department central in handling this - she has my respect."
That does not mean unqualified praise. The government appears to have missed out on negotiating more regular shipments of doses, rather than a quarterly total, he said, and keeping contracts completely secret only fuels questions. "There are things that could have been done better," he said.
"And then some things she had no control over."
The biggest obstacle to acquiring vaccines quickly, Mr. Hyder argued, is that Canada had let its vaccine industry hollow out. Most of the countries vaccinating faster are in jurisdictions like the European Union that manufacture vaccines. Some others rely on Chinese or Russian vaccines. Ms. Anand, trying to buy what every country wants from a handful of multinational suppliers, doesn't have a lot of leverage.
Ms. Anand knows she is trying to execute the plan at a time when, as she says, "every country wants to buy the same product."
She said she has built relationships with vaccine suppliers, with ambassadors from countries that make them, and that those will pay dividends.
Off camera, she smiles and has a gentle sense of humour, but she will tell you firmly that she's on top of her files - and that she taught contract law and reads the fine print. When the Toronto Star asked her if Mr. Trudeau was calling global chief executives of pharmaceutical companies to push for quicker deliveries, she reportedly bristled, "I'm in charge of this file."
She told The Globe and Mail she saw the question as a little belittling. "I don't see my male colleagues being asked those questions," she said.
Mr. Hyder thinks they should be. In this case, he said, it's not a sexist slight. Ms. Anand has been dealing with the Canadian CEOs of vaccine suppliers like Pfizer since August, but until recently, there was no sign Mr. Trudeau had called the companies' global chiefs. There is an assumption the global CEOs will talk to national leaders, he said. "We should have been much more aggressive in getting those relationships built."
That's on Mr. Trudeau. But like a lot of things, from past industrial policy to vaccine nationalism to production problems at a Pfizer plant in Belgium, it can still weigh on whether Ms. Anand's political career is a success or a failure.
The task she has been handed affects the lives of all Canadians.
Millions of them are tracking the progress. Politics means unpredictable pressure, but rarely like this.
When Anita Anand was seven or eight years old, her mother told her two youngest daughters to put dresses on, and drove them 44 kilometres to Greenwood Air Force Base.
"My mom wore her traditional Indian sari. And we all just stood in a crowd," said Sonia Anand, who is a year younger than Anita.
"Then a helicopter landed and Pierre Elliott Trudeau emerged from the helicopter. He saw my mom and her sari, and came right over to her. And he made the Hindu greeting of namaste. That was very touching for my mom. And I remember on the drive back home, she said, ‘You know, you girls need to serve your country.
Your country needs you.' "It wasn't Pierre Trudeau who became the role model that sparked Anita Anand's interest in politics. It was her mom.
As an Indian girl living in Uganda in the 1950s, Saroj Daulat Ram had told her father, a school headmaster, that she didn't want to go into teaching. She wanted to be a doctor. He helped her get to medical school in India, before she transferred to Trinity College in Dublin. In 1965, Dr. Ram and the surgeon she married, Sundarek Vivek Anand, packed up their four-year-old daughter Gita and emigrated from Nigeria to Kentville, N.S., where Anita and Sonia were born.
The three daughters all describe their childhood in Nova Scotia as approaching idyllic.
Their parents told them to work to make it in a new society, Sonia said, and to live a full life in the small community. Anita was a point guard, and played clarinet.
Dr. Ram, who died in 2014, had told her daughters to be self-sufficient, to expect to make their own living and to think of public service, perhaps as a doctor or teacher. (Gita and Anita became lawyers, Sonia a doctor.) But Anita was encouraged to think in terms of politics.
She advocated. "If she didn't think something was fair, or just, she would speak up about it," Sonia said. In high school, she went to a school board meeting to ask for more teachers for her school.
She was student council president in junior high, and again in high school, when she campaigned to have the school bring back celebratory initiation activities for first-year students.
That is a textbook profile of a future lawyer, but when Ms. Anand did finish law school years later she warned the folks interviewing her for an articling position at Bay Street firm Torys that she would go back to academia one day. Corporate and securities lawyers are supposed to dream of deals, but she said she always knew she wouldn't stay in practice - she was interested in public policy.
She talked University of Toronto law professor Michael Trebilcock into supervising her thesis, even after he protested that he had no expertise in the topic: preferential policies, like affirmative action, for visible minorities. She completed it while working at Torys and pregnant with the first of four children, Mr. Trebilcock noted. She had already studied at Oxford and moved on to a fellowship in economics and law at Yale.
Her LLM thesis bore some of the hallmarks of thinking that would be reflected in later work on corporate governance. She generally didn't support numerical quotas for visible minorities, citing arguments mined from philosophy and economics that questioned their fairness and efficiency. She exhibited confidence that there is a benefit in diversity for companies, and that with a policy nudge, the "market" will find a new equilibrium that reflects that. Her decades of work as an expert in corporate governance exhibit the same interest in showing economic actors that environmental and social responsibility are in their interests. There is big-L Liberal idealism and some small-l liberal laissez-faire. "She's not trying to set the world on its head. That's just not Anita," said Mr. Trebilcock. "She would twist it and nudge it to make things better over time."
Ms. Anand made a career as a law prof, first at Queen's University in Kingston, then in an office two doors down from Mr. Trebilcock at the University of Toronto.
She published papers, became a prominent expert in the dense field of corporate governance, was quoted in the media, and wrote business op-eds for The Globe and Mail.
She and her husband, John Knowlton, a senior managing director at the infrastructure arm of giant pension fund OMERS, were affluent, living, as they do now, in a big four-bedroom house in an upscale neighbourhood of Oakville. She had an endowed chair at a top law school. It had been a long time since her mother had encouraged her to go into public life. But her op-eds were sliding from dense legal issues to Ontario Premier Doug Ford's meddling in Hydro One. "A part of me felt that I should be speaking to a broader portion of the Canadian public," she said.
Provincial Liberals in Ontario approached her about running in 2018, but she felt she wouldn't go into politics until her youngest daughter finished high school.
When the local MP for Oakville, John Oliver, made a surprise announcement he would not run again in 2019, her husband told her doors were opening and she should walk through.
Mr. Trudeau's federal Liberals - she won't say who, exactly - asked her to run. She was, after all, the J.R. Kimber Chair in Investor Protection and Corporate Governance at the University of Toronto, an accomplished woman with a long CV who sat on several community organization boards, and an Indo-Canadian from the Hindu, rather than Sikh, side of the community. Another Oakville Liberal, former provincial cabinet minister Kevin Flynn, had thought the party wanted him, but despite his opponent's lack of Liberal background, there were a surprising number of big-league Toronto lawyers and top Liberals, like former Dalton McGuinty staffer and campaign manager Don Guy, endorsing her.
Ms. Anand organized meet-and-greets, armed with her résumé in an unglamorous campaign to sign up Liberal members. "Basically the question was, ‘We know Kevin, we don't know you. So who are you?' " Even after she won the nomination, and the election, she was an unknown. Even after Mr. Trudeau, who had never met her, made her a surprise cabinet appointee.
Public Services and Procurement Canada is a sprawling pile of files. Real estate. Shipbuilding. Defence procurement.
A privacy breach with the the botched Phoenix payroll system for federal employees was one headache.
Ms. Anand had met Mr. Trudeau, for the first time, and been appointed its minister, and, she said, immediately went off to study the entire portfolio.
"Every day something new and exciting happened," she said. "Really. I got elected. I got appointed to cabinet. I'm going to Meech Lake for a cabinet retreat. And all the while I'm saying to myself, ‘I'm going to Meech Lake, I'm going to Meech Lake.' " Then lockdown. And Ms. Anand's department was at the centre of things. With cases rising, hospitals and long-term care centres were screaming for masks, gowns and hand sanitizer. It was feared that a shortage of mechanical ventilators would force doctors to choose who would live and die. PSPC was supposed to get the things everyone wanted. Ms. Anand said she called in the entire management team and told them to get aggressive.
"I said, ‘Do not rely on one manufacturer.' You gotta go to different countries. You gotta go to different manufacturers and you gotta use diverse thinking to attack here," Ms. Anand said.
It's possible to forget now the intensity of that crisis. On April 1, Mr. Trudeau announced Ottawa would spend $2-billion on pandemic supplies. Quebec Premier François Legault had just warned some items like masks would run out in days.
The Canadian government set up logistics chains, with the assistant deputy minister usually responsible for buying military equipment, André Fillion, put in charge. Planes were given a few hours to load at the packed Shanghai airport, where every country was collecting PPE. Ottawa hired people to track goods as they came out at Chinese plants.
"I was watching the planes - like, I'm actually getting notifications about planes landing with N95s on them," Ms. Anand said.
By Easter weekend, there was another impending crisis. In some parts of the country, COVID-19 testing was in danger of being halted because of a shortage of nasal swabs. Staffers dubbed it "Swabmageddon." Ms. Anand spent the weekend calling companies to find enough, one insider said.
The whole rush was complicated by a deluge of solicitations, some from fly-by-night suppliers, so officials had to figure out technical standards and separate real suppliers from dodgy ones. "It was more, ‘I know someone who knows someone,' " she said.
Legitimate manufacturers were gearing up to change production from liquor to hand sanitizer, or from car parts to face shields. They wanted to know what the government wanted, what the specs were, what liability they might face, and so on. Flavio Volpe, president of the Automotive Parts Manufacturers' Association, said he was up in the middle of the night calling a Japanese company working with Canadian foam parts manufacturer Woodbridge to make masks, and he sent an e-mail to Ms. Anand, who quickly replied, connecting him to officials.
"You can critique some of the plays that she called. But she was always a willing quarterback," Mr. Volpe said.
If there's an audit, it will find her department went too far.
In a panic, Ottawa ordered 40,000 ventilators. It has received 22,000, but thousands aren't being used. Some products didn't meet standards. Before Canadian-made nasal swabs could be certified, supply from Italy and the U.S. became available. Ms. Anand touts the fact that the government quickly bought 2.7 billion items overall.
Now, she is more or less assuring Canadians that vaccines will turn out the same way, that the lagging rollout in February will catch up by the end of March, and be plentiful in the fall.
The scale-up needed to meet the timelines still looks daunting. Details of what might go wrong could be in the fine print of those contracts with pharmaceutical giants, but Ms. Anand insists - despite opposition howls of disbelief - that they are entirely covered by confidentiality clauses.
Recently, Ms. Anand found herself skating around reporters' questions about what recourse the government will have if vaccine suppliers don't deliver promised doses this quarter.
The answer is not much, as her former corporate law professor and colleague, Mr. Trebilcock, could tell her: Lawyers for the multinationals producing new vaccines would have included contract caveats about making "best efforts" to deliver, he said. Ottawa could sue, but that won't speed deliveries.
The large and diverse portfolio of vaccine contracts won't matter if shots don't go into arms. The criticism is intense, immediate, and right now, public opinion doesn't appear to be allayed by calls for patience. That would get to anyone.
One colleague said she copes with it all with preparation, to feel like she's got things covered. But when asked how she feels about the ongoing pressure and criticism, Ms. Anand didn't reveal much.
"Determined," she said.

Full text: When Aaron David and Orlee Wertheim decided to build a lakeside cottage in Prince Edward County, a rural community two hours east of their home in Toronto, the couple knew they would offset the construction and carrying costs by putting the place on Airbnb.
What they weren't necessarily sure about was how to stand out in an area already saturated by vacation rentals. In 2019, 1,500 homes in Prince Edward County, or nearly 10 per cent of all houses, were available for short-term lets, according to the municipal government.
"We didn't see a lot of well-designed contemporary homes," says Ms. Wertheim, owner of Coco Market, a trendy food shop in Toronto. "It's what we would want for ourselves. We just couldn't find it elsewhere on the market."
The couple figured that if they built the missing modern, others would be interested as well. The strategy initially proved fruitful.
When construction finished in spring 2020, the house was "booked solid," Mr. David said, with rental fees as much as about $900 a night. However, more recent provincial stay-at-home orders have temporarily halted rentals and the couple are staying there themselves.
On the surface, the house doesn't look terribly different than the many century-old farmsteads dotting the surrounding fields. The overall shape, conceived by Montreal architecture office RHA Works in collaboration with Toronto-and-Mainebased AAMP Studio, borrows from local barns, with pitched roofs over long, simple boxes.
To the well-honed eye, the exterior siding provides the first clue that the house is unique. It's clad in shou sugi ban - planks of cedar, charred using a Japanese technique that brings out the wood's natural insect-and-rot resistance. The boards, sourced from a company called Blackwood Siding Co., north of Prince Edward County in Ontario's Addington Highlands, are not only more durable than typical, unfinished cedar, they have a rich, distinct aesthetic. "From afar, they look solidly black," says architect Anne-Marie Armstong, who worked for Frank Gehry before co-founding AAMP. "The closer you get, there is a beautiful variety in the tones, almost a shimmer.
The appearance changes every time you look at."
For the design team, one of the challenges was creating a custom home to suit both Mr. David and Ms. Wertheim, as well as all the potential tenants whose needs they could only guess at. "At the beginning, I gave Aaron and Orlee a lot of homework," says Ravi Handa, founder of RHA Works. "I basically asked them to think through all the things the house would need, in terms of rooms and programming, as well as all the ways the house might be used."
"We played through many, many possibilities and scenarios," Mr. David says. "We really tried to envision how guests would arrive, unload their groceries, unload their things, inhabit each space. We had a lot of fun doing it."
The forethought is partly why the house has its character defining, L-shaped layout. One end of the L contains four bedrooms, arranged one after the other down a long, window-lit hallway. The other end has the kitchen, dining and living areas, white-walled but made warm with touches of light wood. The separation of more public and private areas solves a typical cottage conundrum - how to balance social time with friends and family, with the need for the peace, quiet and solitude that probably inspired the rural getaway in the first place. (There was a second reason for the L: it buffers the prevailing north winds, sheltering a patio area that faces south over adjacent Lake Ontario.)
A roomy, glass-walled vestibule hinges the two arms of the L together. A few steps from the end of the driveway, it's an easy spot to unpack a car stuffed with all the things city escapees tend to bring. To one side of it, it leads directly into the kitchen pantry, with storage for chips and marshmallows and bottles of whatever.
To the other side, the bedrooms, all on the same level, so no suitcases need to be hauled up stairs.
Throughout, the cottage is kept simple, with just a few pieces of furniture (sourced by Toronto design consultant Meg Cassidy), and subtle-but-hardy materials, such as stone kitchen counters. "I'm not saying renters don't care about the place they are staying," Mr. David says. "But I wouldn't put it past someone to think, I'm in a rental, now is the time to try deep-frying for the first time in a vat of spattering oil."
Instead, the charm of the place comes down to more elemental pleasures. The beauty of the wood grain in the ceiling. The crackle of the fireplace in the living room. The windows were particularly well placed to capture the natural environs. In the dinning area, a large picture window punches the wall above the table, framing a tableau similar to a pastoral painting: a neighbouring farm, a few trees and bushes, big blue skies with fluffy white clouds. Every now and again, maybe just to keep things real, a car drives by.
Because the house was completed last spring, in the most uncertain days of the pandemic, Mr. David and Ms. Wertheim had a moment of wondering if they should sell the property. They weren't sure if their plans to rent would fall through under the looming lockdowns, or how much use they themselves would be able to get out of Toronto. "We honestly didn't know what we would do, or what was going to happen," Mr. David says. "Then we spent a night in the house.
Looking out at the night sky from our bedroom, seeing all the stars, seeing the lake in the distance.
That made us think no matter what, this is it, this is ours."

A gritty piece of Toronto heritage under threat: ARCHITOURIST

Full text: Two of the Toronto Daily Star notices were two columns wide and the third was three columns wide. Each began with "In Memory Of" and each announced the closing, on Wednesday, Nov. 10, 1948, of the offices, plants and branch plants of the National Iron Corp., the Railway and Power Engineering Corp. and Dominion Wheel and Foundries Ltd., in memory of their president, Mr. Joseph A. Kilpatrick.
Mr. Kilpatrick's obituary, which was printed in newspapers across Canada the next day - including The Globe and Mail - trumpeted the achievements of "one of Canada's outstanding industrialists," and outlined his "small beginnings" as an apprentice mould maker to that of creator of "a network of foundries and manufacturing plants across the Dominion."
Born in Rothsay, Ont., in 1868, by the end of his life, North America's "oldest active foundryman" would serve as president or board chair to companies in Albany, N.Y., Vancouver and Montreal, as well as Toronto.
It seems Mr. Kilpatrick was very highly regarded. Too bad his remaining buildings in Toronto haven't enjoyed a similar respect.
Last month, by provincial government order, bulldozers began ripping into the walls of the foundry building of Dominion Wheel and Foundries after a somewhat vague announcement about the need to build affordable housing on the expansive site, which is now hemmed in by a new neighbourhood of condominiums (some built as residences for the 2015 Pan American Games).
One of four remaining buildings of a much larger complex once engaged in building railway equipment, rolling stock and machinery, when the 1951 building at 153 Eastern Ave. was breached, alarm bells rang throughout the heritage community.
And after multiple protests, petitions and harsh words by Toronto councillor Kristyn WongTam, the province finally pushed the pause button.
The four buildings are listed in Toronto's heritage inventory and are provincially owned. While the province is charged with protecting heritage structures, it has used a Ministerial Zoning Order (MZO) to abrogate its own responsibility.
Insult was added to injury when crews removed Heritage Toronto's 2012 plaque, although on Feb.
12 a spokesperson for the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing said "some elements" of the site might be preserved.
On a recent and bitterly cold morning, Heritage Toronto's Chris Bateman joined me for a walkabout of the site. And while we tried to keep our political axes (and grinding wheels) holstered, we couldn't help but wonder why all parties can't be satisfied.
"Everywhere you look there's an example of what you could do with buildings like this," said Mr. Bateman, 34, his English accent still prominent after 11 years in Canada.
"Ways that heritage can be kept not just because of some legal requirement, but can be the draw, like [Artscape] Wychwood [Barns], the Distillery ..." Walking east, our conversation trailed off as we passed the Dominion office building at No. 171 (built in 1930). Not only are lovely red-and-white checkerboard tiles visible between the pilasters that frame the front door, we found that the empty space beside the building seemed more than large enough to build upon (as is the massive space at Rolling Mills Road and Palace Street). As we walked south to admire the tucked-away machine shop at No.
185, we speculated that, perhaps, not everyone has come to understand that different cities have different forms of heritage.
"For places like London and Paris it's a different story in terms of how the city was built out," Mr. Bateman said. "This is Toronto's heritage - it's places of work, like factories and foundries."
Which means the Distillery District is our Old Montreal, since we Torontonians were stiff-upper-lip Victorians with noses to the grindstone; we didn't do "fun" in Toronto until, perhaps, the 1960s.
This means, Bartosz Walczak writes, we need to "reassess history in a such a way that the past [is] seen not only in terms of the Antique ... but also in the context of individual national cultures."
While Mr. Walczak was writing his 2005 paper, The Importance of Industrial Heritage for Cultural Landscape of Lodz and Its Local Identity on the textile mills of Lodz, Poland, his words resonate here as well.
While the concept of "industrial heritage" has been around since 1959 (when the Brits held the world's first Committee for Industrial Archaeology), many cities still need to move past the idea that mills and factories are too utilitarian to preserve, he continues, since they "may constitute an important stage of development in a particular nation or region, and as such can be of historic importance.
"Textile mills are, moreover, of great social significance as places where numbers of people worked. The mills were a part of the economic basis for the development of folk culture and the growth of communities in general."
Mr. Bateman, although shivering, agreed: "You see the aerial photos of this area and it's all factories, tanneries, railway sidings, like a huge industrial area. ... It's a real piece of neighbourhood heritage."
If only, I suggest, we could go back in time and pay a visit to the storied Canary Restaurant, just a stone's throw away, to ask a few old-timers about what a huffing, puffing hive of activity this area once was, and what it meant to the "folk culture" of the neighbourhood, we might convince those in power to save more than a few token pieces.
"You could easily have a couple of extra buildings on this site, filling in some of the gaps and retain these heritage buildings. ... I think that's a conversation that hasn't happened at all, and people are understandably upset," Mr. Bateman said.
"Once they're gone, they're gone."

Full text: THE LISTING The construction industry is crying foul after the City of Toronto announced that it will circumvent a freeze on development charges imposed by the province and levy heavy penalties on builders who defer paying fees on some projects.
City staff had said that the municipal government could lose hundreds of millions of dollars in fees because of the province's move. Don Valley North Councillor Shelley Carroll referred to it as "a really heinous change."
"Now is the time to build in real incentives, it's not the time to turn a moderate incentive to a big disincentive," said Daryl Chong, the president and chief executive of the Greater Toronto Apartment Association, who called the city's move a "bridge to nowhere."
"If the economics supported building rental we would have been doing it all of these years.
With COVID, we're now in unknown territory."
On Feb. 5, Toronto City Council voted 23-2 to adopt an interim change to the way it collects development charges, setting an interest rate of prime plus 3 per cent for any fees that are deferred for rental projects, including those for non-profit housing. Only longterm-care projects will not have to pay the extra interest.
In late 2019, Ontario passed the More Homes, More Choice Act in a bid to cut what it called the "red tape" hindering housing developers. It included changes to development charges: Whereas in the past, a developer paid the going rate when a project was getting its building permits, as of Jan. 1, 2020, the province mandated development charges be frozen at whatever the rates were when the project applied for planning approval. (For many projects, the gap between application, planning approval and ultimate construction can be years.)
The issue of development charges is controversial in the Toronto region. Municipal governments say the levies are needed so that new developments can help pay for the infrastructure they require. But for developers, they can account for a significant portion of the total cost of building in a region that already has high land and construction costs.
According to a report from the real estate data company Altus Group, in the rest of Canada, the average development charge and other taxes for new high-rise development is about $20,600, or 4 per cent of the total cost. In the Greater Toronto Area, it's $57,800, or 10.7 per cent of the cost. The highest local fees are in York Region, which averages $70,700 (14 per cent of the total cost of the unit), compared with the City of Toronto's $76,800 average (11 per cent of the cost).
In Toronto, development charges are the same for condominium apartments or purposebuilt rental apartments, but the province now allows rental developers to defer paying development charges for up to 20 years.
In a submission to council, the Building Industry and Land Development Association said that Toronto's rate was too high. It cited as an example a 250-unit rental building, arguing that if a developer chose to defer $10-million worth of charges within five years, it would cost an additional $949,000 to do so. The interest rate can be lowered if the builder provides a letter of credit, but as BILD CEO David Wilkes pointed out, letters of credit can be financially crippling for developers who need to take on debt to finance construction.
"We do not support the barriers of adding costs or securities that delay construction. ... Let's get on with the job of providing purpose-built rental," Mr. Wilkes said.
The province has not objected to Toronto's interim plans, or the broader city review of the policies regarding development charges now under way. But it did defend its development-charge freeze.
"We must increase the supply and mix of homes in Ontario," the Ministry of Municipal Affairs and Housing said in a statement.
"That's why we deferred development charges for certain types of development, like purpose-built rentals, which face unique upfront revenue challenges. However, we also recognize the importance of maintaining municipal revenues from new developments, and at this time have chosen not [to] prescribe a maximum interest rate."
"[Premier Doug] Ford has a track record of meddling in city business and not necessarily making things better," said Jessica Bell, MPP for University Rosedale and the Ontario New Democratic Party's critic for housing policy.
"They did not consult and refuse to listen to municipalities on issues of cash-flow and city planning."
Ms. Bell agrees that the city needs to build more rental, but disagrees with downloading the costs associated with incentivizing that construction onto municipalities. "The market alone is not going to provide the amount of housing we need to make our city a great place to live. We have tried that experiment and it has failed.
Toronto has undergone a record construction boom, but at the same time that's not translating to affordable rental and affordable homes."
David Amborski with Ryerson University's School of Urban and Regional Planning is more blunt when comparing the propertytax-based revenue tools available to cities compared with the income-tax bases of upper levels of government: "Subsidies for purpose-built rental should come from levels of government that have progressive tax bases."

Full text: With a severe contraction in the number of houses for sale in Toronto and surrounding cities, anxious buyers have been lobbing money at the few properties that do arrive on the market.
In Oshawa, Ont., and other parts of Durham Region, Shawn Lackie, a real estate agent with Coldwell Banker R.M.R. Real Estate, says buyers have been paying eye-popping premiums even for modest houses.
"These places that are selling are little shacks," he says.
Mr. Lackie sees worrying signs in the bedroom communities east of Toronto: Even during the frothy days of 2016, buyers typically only entered competition for the most desirable houses, he points out.
"They were bidding on properties that were worthy of insanity," Mr. Lackie says. Now, "it's right across all areas and all sizes. We're back to full-on madness."
He points to one recent example on Olive Street in Oshawa, where a 1,100-square-foot house was listed with an asking price of $650,000 and sold for $802,000 after five bullies submitted bids ahead of the date scheduled for reviewing offers.
Mr. Lackie says the house last changed hands in 2018 for $200,000.
Another bungalow of about the same size was listed with an asking price of $499,000 and sold for $713,000 in Oshawa.
In the small town of Orono a little farther east, a house listed with an asking price of $499,000 sold for $731,000.
In Mr. Lackie's opinion, the growth in prices is not sustainable.
When he works with buyers, Mr. Lackie advises them to think about their exit strategy before they purchase a property. Buyers need to think about how long they want to live in the property and whether the amount they're paying represents good value if they sell after a number of years.
He fears people who are paying amounts far above recent sales in the area are getting way ahead of the market.
"If you're paying $800,000, how long do you have to live there until the market comes up to the home? People are throwing money around like drunken sailors. I'm not really a fan of this."
Mr. Lackie says the combination of a lack of supply and rockbottom interest rates is driving the run-up.
He adds that some of the purchasers appear to be first-time buyers who want to get into the market at any cost. Others are homeowners from Toronto who are flush with cash from selling a property in the city.
If homeowners sell their house in Willowdale for $1.6million, for example, they don't have a problem offering $800,000 or $900,000 in a small town because they still have $700,000 left over.
The inflation is leading to mounting frustration for local people who have been saving up for a house over time, he adds.
"They're getting blown out of the water," he says. "They can't compete with that." Mr. Lackie worked with one young Toronto couple who were renting a 740-square-foot townhouse in Liberty Village, he says, and wanted a backyard for themselves and their large dog.
Mr. Lackie says the couple looked at townhouses in Whitby and other parts of Durham, but they found the properties that fit within their budget were small and uninspiring.
When they extended their search north and east to Port Perry, they found a vacant bungalow listed with an asking price of $750,000. They first submitted an offer of $695,000 and, after some back and forth, signed a deal for $715,000.
The couple was nervous at the time, Mr. Lackie says, but other bungalows nearby have since sold for $775,000 and $760,000.
Looking ahead, Mr. Lackie expects the runaway price growth to slow at some point.
"This is accelerated. They've got their foot on the gas pedal and I don't know how long this can go."
The Canadian Real Estate Association reports the number of listings across Canada stood at fewer than 100,000 on New Year's Day, which marks the lowest tally recorded in data going back three decades.
Sales were up by more than new supply in December, CREA senior economist Shaun Cathcart says. The national sales-tonew-listing ratio tightened to 77.4 per cent - among the highest levels on record for the measure. The long-term average for the national sales-to-new-listings ratio is 54.2 per cent, Mr. Cathcart says.
Elise Stern, a broker with Harvey Kalles Real Estate Ltd., says buyers in Toronto grappling with the low supply are using tactics such as bully offers to get ahead of the competition.
Her clients recently tried to submit a bully offer for a fourbedroom house in Thornhill Woods with an asking price of $1.699-million. The sellers declined to look at the offer, so Ms. Stern's clients showed up on the scheduled night with a bid of $1.761-million, which the homeowners accepted.
The house on a quiet cul-desac was previously listed in December, 2019, with an asking price of $1.588-million, but at that time it failed to find a buyer after 50 days on the market.
Ms. Stern says one reason for the low supply in the city is that some sellers prefer to sell quietly without launching their home on the Multiple Listing Service of the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board. The homeowners are reluctant to have numerous people through the property and they also don't want to undertake the decluttering, painting and staging that helps to make a home appealing to a wider pool of buyers.
Ms. Stern has recently sold two properties on an exclusive basis.
In such deals, sellers are saying "this is the number that I'd be prepared to sell it at today," and Ms. Stern puts the word out to fellow agents and her own list of buyers to see if there are any takers.
"The exclusive network is upand-running."
Ms. Stern expects the intense bidding to continue because buyers have preapproved mortgages with low rates lined up, and they become anxious when they miss out on properties that sell to competing buyers. If they sit on the sidelines, they see prices rapidly escalate.
"If a house sells for a lot of money, that becomes the new benchmark," she says.
Ms. Stern advises clients to visit a mortgage broker and become educated about the market action in advance so that they can feel confident when the time comes to make an offer.
"I try to keep them level-headed," she says.
"I don't ever want them to overextend themselves financially."

Full text: Lionel Desmond was a desperately ill man, and he knew it.
The former Canadian soldier was suffering from severe post-traumatic stress disorder and a possible traumatic brain injury when he was released from the military in 2015. Veterans Affairs Canada was responsible for his continuing care, but something went terribly wrong after he was discharged from a treatment facility in Montreal in August, 2016.
On Jan. 3, 2017, Mr. Desmond used a Soviet-era SKS 7.62 semi-automatic carbine to kill his 52-year-old mother, Brenda, his 31-year-old wife, Shanna, and their 10year-old daughter, Aaliyah, in the family's home in Big Tracadie, N.S.
A provincial fatality inquiry investigating the killings, which is scheduled to resume Tuesday after an 11-month hiatus caused by the pandemic, is expected to hear testimony this week from Mr. Desmond's sister Cassandra and other members of the Desmond family.
Cassandra and her twin sister, Chantel, led a vocal campaign to establish the inquiry, arguing that their brother, a veteran of the war in Afghanistan, did not receive the treatment he needed when he returned home to Nova Scotia.
During 17 days of hearings that wrapped up in March, the inquiry uncovered key evidence that is sure to figure prominently in the commission's findings and recommendations.
Among other things, the inquiry learned Mr. Desmond received no therapeutic treatment in the four months before the triple murder-suicide.
"In the first phase of the Desmond Inquiry, we learned how Veterans Affairs allowed Cpl. Desmond to leave their care and return to his family and community without any real transitional support," says Adam Rodgers, a lawyer who represents Mr. Desmond's estate and Cassandra.
"Veterans Affairs allowed him to leave the program and return to Nova Scotia without having set up any counselling or other mental-health supports."
The inquiry also learned that Mr. Desmond was so desperate to find help that on at least two occasions he travelled to a hospital in nearby Antigonish, N.S., where he was seen by doctors in the emergency department.
Dr. Ian Slayter, a hospital psychiatrist, told the inquiry that when he spoke to Mr. Desmond in December, 2016, he was unaware the former infantryman had already met with a psychotherapist contracted by Veterans Affairs. Dr. Slayter later produced a report saying it appeared Mr. Desmond was "falling through the cracks in terms of follow-up by military and veterans programs."
During his testimony, Dr. Slayter agreed when asked if federal and provincial health care workers were operating in silos that prevented them from providing the best treatment for Mr. Desmond.
"After returning home, and having been left to his own devices for months, Cpl. Desmond sought help from local psychiatrists and counsellors," Mr. Rodgers said in a recent e-mail. "These professionals did their best but were severely limited in what insight they could gain because they were not provided any records from Veterans Affairs. There do not appear to be any effective protocols in place for sharing of information when a soldier is discharged into civilian life."
Provincial court Judge Warren Zimmer, the inquiry's commissioner, has pointed to evidence suggesting Veterans Affairs did not share key information about the severity of Mr. Desmond's mental illness with one of the last health professionals to talk to the 33-year-old.
Catherine Chambers, a therapist who specializes in treating PTSD, told the inquiry she never received any medical documents from the federal department.
Veterans Affairs also drew fire from a family doctor in New Brunswick who had prescribed cannabis to Mr. Desmond. Paul Smith, told the inquiry that soldiers given medical discharges for PTSD were generally treated poorly by the department.
"Our PTSD soldiers are chastised," he testified on Feb. 24, 2020. "They are treated like lepers." Dr. Smith later apologized for those comments when challenged by a lawyer representing the federal government. The inquiry has yet to hear testimony from anyone representing Veterans Affairs.
On another front, the inquiry is also examining whether the Desmond family had access to domestic violence services, and whether health care professionals were trained to deal with that kind of challenge.
Health care workers and police told the inquiry Mr. Desmond and his wife Shanna had a troubled relationship after he left the military in 2015. There was a longstanding pattern of conflict that included calls to police.
Only hours before Mr. Desmond killed his family, he placed a call to his new therapist to say Shanna had asked him for a divorce. The inquiry also learned that around the same time, Shanna Desmond called a non-profit group that offers support to women facing intimate partner violence.
Nicole Mann, executive director of the Naomi Society in Antigonish, N.S., told the inquiry that an unidentified woman, whom she later identified as Shanna Desmond, had called to ask about how to obtain a peace bond, though she gave no indication she was at risk.
"She didn't speak of any domestic violence," Ms. Mann testified. "This person was not in crisis or distraught in any way."
The hearings, which before the pandemic were held in a municipal building in Guysborough, N.S., are scheduled to resume inside a larger courthouse in nearby Port Hawkesbury.

Full text: DONE DEAL 455 Rue Saint-Pierre, PH530, Montreal OLD MONTREAL Asking price: $2.8-million Selling price: $2.65-million Taxes: $17,828 (2020) Days on the market: 10 Listing agent: Martin Rouleau, Engel & Volkers Montréal THE ACTION There was keen buyer interest in the 3,246-square-foot apartment, says agent Martin Rouleau. One house-hunter living in New York had a virtual visit arranged. In the end, the offer that was accepted came from a young Montrealer, Mr. Rouleau said.
The sales process took only 10 days, a reflection of the continued robustness of Old Montreal's condo market, he added. "There are slightly fewer foreign buyers, but demand is there. I wish there was more inventory."
WHAT THEY GOT A luxury penthouse condominium in the heart of historic Old Montreal, a district famous for its narrow cobblestoned streets and imposing carved-stone buildings.
The condo is in a neo-renaissance 40-unit edifice built in 1865; it's just up the street from the Phi Centre, a hip showcase for the latest in art, film and technology.
The condo building, known as the Caverhill, underwent a major renovation in 2001. The threebedroom penthouse occupies two floors. There is indoor parking for three vehicles.
THE AGENT'S TAKE Living in a heritage protected neighbourhood means not having to worry about view-blocking towers going up right next door, Mr. Rouleau said.
Speaking of views, the sightlines from the condo's generously sized rooftop terrace are outstanding, he says. "It's definitely the big ‘wow' element here."

Full text: Heritage homeowner Pierre Bleau is a passionate hands-on restorer. But the continuing work on his 1905 Victorian home in the east end of Montreal also requires the services of skilled craftspeople.
The retired City of Montreal engineer has been lovingly - patiently - restoring the house in the old quarter of Pointe-auxTrembles for more than two decades. He is skilled in carpentry and has a decently equipped workshop in the basement. On some jobs, though, outside assistance was called in.
For the decorative rosettes at the top of the interior door frames and on the rooftop cornice, he located a local heritage cabinetmaker well-versed in the precise look of this traditional design element.
To help tackle the restoration of the posts and handrail of the front porch railing, Mr. Bleau found a sawmill and a woodworker with the appropriate tools to accurately reproduce the original configuration.
Finding the craftspeople who can bring the skills and experience necessary to ensure a heritage restoration is done right can be a challenge.
"Good craftspeople are becoming rare," says Mr. Bleau, 61, who is a member of a group devoted to preserving the province's stock of old houses, Amis et propriétaires de maisons anciennes du Québec (APMAQ).
"You usually end up finding the right person, but often they turn out to be swamped with work."
The preservation and upkeep of the built heritage depends on a healthy and thriving base of skilled craftspeople. Experts in the field have for years been warning of a serious gap in the training of these specialized artisans.
So it was welcome news recently when the Conseil des métiers d'art du Québec (CMAQ) launched a program to train stonemasons, carpenters and cabinet-makers.
The lessons got under way in January, with nine students enrolled in the 15-week course, says France Girard, CMAQ's project manager in architecture and heritage.
"To preserve the built heritage we need to have the means to do it," she said.
Alain Lachance, a master cabinet-maker from Notre-Dame-duPortage, Que., is part of the team of instructors in the program.
"This is the realization of a dream we've had for years," he said. "We need to make sure there is a new generation carrying on the tradition."
CMAQ has overseen heritage training sessions in the past but they were mostly patchwork attempts lasting just a few days or weeks, Mr. Lachance said.
Besides the sessions covering theory, students in the new courses will also get best-practices instruction and drawing lessons as well as practical exercises and experience working on the Maison Hurtubise, a 1739 farmhouse in Westmount that is one of the oldest homes on the Island of Montreal.
Robert Pajot of the Ottawabased National Trust for Canada, says CMAQ's initiative is a muchneeded addition to the existing offerings scattered across Canada.
"There are so few training programs for the heritage trades across the country," said Mr. Pajot, project leader, regeneration, at the not-for-profit organization dedicated to the preservation of historic sites.
"We need more of these programs. More skills programs out there raise the profile of heritage preservation."
Among well-regarded existing programs are Heritage Retrofit Carpentry at Holland College on Prince Edward Island; Heritage Carpentry and Joinery as well as pre-apprenticeship masonry and other trades at Algonquin College in Perth, Ont.; and courses at the Willowbank School of Restoration Arts in Queenston, Ont.
At Algonquin, a B.Sc in Built Heritage has been proposed, Mr. Pajot said.
"We have some catching up to do" in Quebec, says John Diodati, a heritage conservation specialist and associate at Montreal architecture firm EVOQ.
Quite a bit of effort remains to get governments at all levels to better recognize the heritage trades through accreditation and the regulatory framework, Mr. Diodati said.
Currently, too much red tape keeps skilled tradespeople and small heritage contractors from getting access to building sites, he added.
Taïka Baillargeon, assistant director of policy at Heritage Montreal, views CMAQ's new program as "excellent news, an important development."
"There is a huge need," she said.
Heritage activists in the province have been calling for a co-ordinated government policy that includes measures to bolster training while also implementing tax credits and other incentives to encourage preservation.
These days, local municipalities and boroughs, including the Montreal suburbs of Laval and Longueuil, are making more of an effort to implement heritagepreservation plans, Ms. Baillargeon said.
Heritage activists in Quebec have lived through a number of "traumatic experiences" over the past few years involving the disappearance of important heritage sites that brought home the urgency of the situation, she said.
One incident in particular left many in the heritage milieu distraught: the destruction of the circa 1820 maison Beaulieu in Chambly, a house closely connected to the 1837-1838 Rebellions.
The structure was knocked down without warning in 2018 by the City of Chambly, its owner and supposed protector; officials said they had no choice because the building was structurally unfit and represented a "public hazard." A group of concerned citizens had been calling for its preservation.
"There is still much work to be done to raise awareness" of the importance of preservation, said Ms. Baillargeon of Heritage Montreal.
The National Trust's Mr. Pajot points out how crucial in the overall preservation picture is the training and upgrading of heritage trades skills. Specialized masons, carpenters, blacksmiths, plasterers, roofers and others have a keen grasp of the materials, traditional building techniques and restoration methods, he said.
"We need more of them. More skilled programs out there raise the profile of heritage preservation."
Mr. Diodati of EVOQ says the traditional crafts in Quebec could benefit from the heightened demand for their expertise that would result from increased government funding for heritage projects.
Consider, too, the advantages on the sustainability front to be gained from promoting greater use of the heritage trades and a more pro-active approach to preservation, he said.
Creating and funding training programs could be part of postCOVID-19 efforts for a green economic recovery. Heritage rehabilitation and adaptive reuse of buildings rate highly in terms of environmental benefits. Maintaining and upgrading old buildings often represents a better option than tearing them down and putting up new ones.

Full text: A necessary, yet undesirable, cage has been placed around all of us these past months. We peer at video simulacra of each other, sing in the shower instead of attending concerts and trips to the grocery store are akin to Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness.
But the global pandemic cannot quash dreams, or anticipation of the future gift of hugging, playing and watching music.
And Thier + Curran Architects have just finished tying an even bigger bow on the Hamilton Music Collective's dream for 2021, and many years to come.
"What we've accomplished together, to me this is quite remarkable," says HMC CEO Astrid Hepner, her German accent still shaping her words after decades in North America. "We, as a fairly new not-for-profit, to have a building like this is quite unusual, and I really hope that this will set an example of what actually can be done when people work together."
Ms. Hepner, architect Bill Curran and John and Ellie Voortman Charitable Foundation director Carl Joosse have worked very well together indeed. With the massive expansion of the Gasworks at 141 Park Rd. N. now complete, all that remains is permission to reopen the doors. Hamilton's children are depending on it, after all.
But first, a little backstory is in order.
Shortly after leaving a record executive career in New York (with Hamilton-born husband and lauded musician Darcy Hepner) in 2005, Ms. Hepner founded the Hamilton Music Collective with a group of like-minded individuals. And, after witnessing the success of the German program For Every Child an Instrument (Jedem Kind ein Instrument), the HMC's largest initiative, An Instrument for Every Child (AIFEC), was born; now, the most underprivileged of Hamilton's children would receive loaner instruments and lessons, free of charge.
Like most charities, Ms. Hepner first ran AIFEC out of her house. After that, it was housed in the kitchen of the Hamilton Philharmonic Orchestra. Fundraising, then as now, was always a challenge, and Ms. Hepner admits to wanting to throw in the towel more than once. "I was ready to say ‘I'm done,' " confirms the saxophonist who lists Tito Puente and Celia Cruz, among others, on her musical résumé. "And that's when you came on the scene and that was such a game changer in so many ways," she finishes, looking over at Mr. Joosse, who is all smiles underneath his wool beanie.
That was 2014, and Mr. Joosse - whom Mr. Curran describes as "a lovely surfer-type" - was just about to get the keys to 141 Park St. N. His parents, John and Ellie Voortman - the bakery Voortmans, not the cookie Voortmans - had entrusted him to find worthy causes to support, and he'd just been introduced to Ms. Hepner by local recording engineer/producer Trevor Titian.
"We realized that here in Hamilton, one of the biggest impacts we could make was to give music to the children," Mr. Joosse says with a twinkle in his eye.
"And then that self-esteem gets raised, and the [school] attendance goes up, and postsecondary rates go up ... and it can affect, literally, everyone.
"Everyone is a little better when they have some art in their lives."
And the 1850 building needed betterment in its life. While the handsome structure began with the noble purpose of feeding the Victorian city with street lamp fuel as the Hamilton Gas Light Company, most Hamiltonians remember it as the site of the notorious Dominion Christian Centre, which often made headlines for the wrong reasons.
And while the building worked well for Mr. Joosse and HMC for the first few years - there were many successful concerts, events and jam sessions - its many inadequacies needed to be addressed.
"It came with the ghosts, but it also came with a pile of fire orders because the previous owners had done a whole bunch of things without building permits," Mr. Curran says. "So we had to fix that, and at the same time there was an opportunity to add the things that were missing." To wit, Mr. Curran and associate Kyle Slote have doubled the size of building, adding a muchneeded lobby - "After an event you basically plowed out into the parking lot and went home," Mr. Curran says - green room, recording studio, elevator, accessible washrooms, triple the classroom space for Ms. Hepner, instrument storage, one-on-one rehearsal rooms, fire stairs and office space for other groups supported by the Voortman foundation.
Though you'd never know it from the street. Ever mindful of heritage and the importance of scale, the architects placed 95 per cent of the new stuff at the rear, adding only a covered walkway to the side of the building - highlighted by a glassy stair-tower at midpoint - so that guests, students, or concertgoers know where to direct their feet.
Inside, warm woods, sculptural light fixtures, gobs of natural light and a cheerful colour palette keep things homey and welcoming rather than stuffy and institutional, which was important to Ms. Hepner: "You don't always have to build this institution that screams, ‘You have to have money to enter this' ... it could be a great example to other communities."
That the building is quietly located a few streets over from the action on James Street North, and rubs shoulders with houses from the 1870s and 1970s helps also. Although the neighbourhood is a little hardscrabble today, the Gasworks and its occupants will no doubt act as a catalyst for positive change ... with all of those happy children, how could it not?
"It's kind of like a non-profit Disneyland that we're in," Ms. Hepner says with a big smile.
"Lives are being changed now by the programs that are coming out of this building," Mr. Curran says.
More than 6000 children have gone through HMC programs over the past decade. Although many corporate sponsors are already on board, with HMC's outreach program providing music lessons in over a dozen Hamilton elementary schools, more are always welcome.

CIBC abandons FirstCaribbean sale after regulators block deal

Full text: Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce was forced to abandon the sale of a majority stake in its Caribbean business after regulators blocked the transaction over concerns about the change of ownership amid a global health crisis.
In late 2019, CIBC announced a US$797-million agreement to sell a 66.7-per-cent stake in Barbados-based FirstCaribbean International Bank to GNB Financial Group Ltd., a company run by Colombian banker and real estate developer Jaime Gilinski.
But the deal became mired in regulatory delays and, despite a last-ditch effort by CIBC's corporate development team to win over the watchdogs in December and January, the deal failed to win regulators' approval because of uncertainty about the buyer, according to two people familiar with the transaction.
The Globe and Mail is not identifying its sources because they are not authorized to discuss these matters publicly.
On Wednesday, CIBC said in a news release that it would not go forward with the sale because it "did not receive approval from FirstCaribbean's regulators," but declined to specify why.
An internal memo to staff, reviewed by The Globe, noted that "much has changed since the transaction was originally proposed," and with uncertainty around the speed of an economic recovery, "the regulators are cognizant of the systemic importance of FirstCaribbean and the role it plays in the region."
The deal would have handed control of FirstCaribbean to a foreigner who was putting up little of his own capital.
When the deal was struck 14 months ago, GNB Financial agreed to pay US$200-million in cash, and CIBC had promised to finance the rest of the purchase price, keeping a 24.9-per-cent stake in FirstCaribbean in the process.
FirstCaribbean employs about 2,900 people in 64 branches and offices across 16 Caribbean countries, including Barbados, the Bahamas and the Cayman Islands.
The pandemic has also had a severe impact on Caribbean economies, many of which rely heavily on the travel industry, and it is too early to tell how long it will take them to recover. A stable owner with a history in the region such as CIBC was a more comforting prospect.
CIBC has done business in the Caribbean since the 1920s, and FirstCaribbean was created in 2002 when CIBC and Barclays PLC merged their local operations. Four years later, Barclays sold its stake in the venture, ceding control to CIBC in 2006.
DBRS Morningstar analyst Rob Colangelo said in a note to clients that CIBC indicated that the regulator's refusal "was largely based on the worsening impact" of COVID-19 on the Caribbean economy.
The lead regulator reviewing the deal was the Central Bank of Barbados, with additional oversight from the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank. Neither regulator has explained their decisions, and representatives of each did not respond to requests for comment.
Over all, the rejected sale is "a negative" for CIBC, "as we believe the operations and the region, overall, face difficult challenges," John Aiken, an analyst at Barclays Capital Canada Inc., said in a note to clients.
Had CIBC's transaction with GNB been approved, CIBC expected a boost to its capital reserves - as measured by its common equity Tier 1 (CET1) ratio - of about 40 basis points (100 basis points equal one percentage point).
That would have equated to about $1-billion in extra capital, according to Gabriel Dechaine, an analyst at National Bank Financial Inc. But CIBC still has the third-highest CET1 ratio of any major Canadian bank at 12.1 per cent, as of Oct. 31.
"While this transaction would have supported FirstCaribbean's long-term growth prospects, it is only one way of creating value for stakeholders," said Harry Culham, CIBC's head of capital markets who also oversees FirstCaribbean, in a statement.
The first clear sign that the deal was in serious jeopardy came in December, when CIBC announced it had changed its accounting for FirstCaribbean and was no longer holding it as an asset for sale.
At the time, chief financial officer Hratch Panossian said CIBC was still pursuing the deal, but there was "more uncertainty" around its fate.
CIBC is not the only Canadian bank looking to pull up deep roots in the Caribbean, a market fraught with challenges such as varied local laws and regulations, increasingly frequent natural disasters, and risks tied to financial crime.
When Bank of Nova Scotia sold its operations in several smaller Caribbean countries, the bank encountered pushback from the local government in Antigua and Barbuda and had a part of the deal turned down by Guyana's central bank. In late 2019, Royal Bank of Canada sidestepped similar headaches by selling its eastern Caribbean operations to a consortium of local banks.
CIBC has made multiple attempts to exit the Caribbean, or to start reducing its ownership, but all have fallen through.
Notably, the bank attempted to list FirstCaribbean on U.S.
stock markets in 2018, looking to raise as much as US$240-million by offering 9.6 million shares, but failed to garner enough support from investors.
As it stands, CIBC owns nearly 92 per cent of FirstCaribbean, which has about US$12.2-billion in assets.

Lifting the veil of secrecy on MindGeek's online pornography empire

Full text: Searching online for Feras Antoon, the CEO of adult entertainment conglomerate MindGeek, turns up a curious website called Feras Antoon Reports. For the past few years, someone by that name has written dozens of articles about business, technology and, for some reason, weight-loss tips for women. His biography tells us Mr. Antoon is a "master in strategic planning," an expert in search engine optimization and the "Gandalf" of his field.
The bio never specifies what, exactly, Mr. Antoon does, but there is a black-and-white headshot of this corporate Gandalf, a square-jawed, steely-eyed man in a sharp suit. The picture is a freely available stock photo, in fact, and the man depicted is a Norwegian podcaster whose name is not Feras Antoon.
While MindGeek did not answer a question about whether Mr. Antoon had the site created, it does resemble the sort of search-engine-optimized vapour conjured by reputation management firms, something the head of a pornography empire that guards its privacy might find useful.
But now the veil of secrecy over MindGeek is being lifted.
In December, it struggled to fend off accusations it allowed child sexual abuse material and other non-consensual videos to be posted on Pornhub, one of the sites it owns.
Mastercard and Visa then suspended the use of their cards on the site, with Mastercard citing an internal review that found "unlawful content."
MindGeek, which operates from Montreal, is one of the largest porn companies in the world, with some US$460-million in revenue and 1,800 employees globally.
One of a handful of companies that upended the adult industry by unleashing a wave of free content across the internet, it has long sought to obscure its corporate identity - while heavily promoting a broad suite of sites that includes Pornhub, YouPorn and many more.
Its reach now extends into many areas of the business. MindGeek runs free sites and subscriber-based ones, a platform for performers to sell videos, an adult video game subsidiary, a VPN product so users can browse anonymously and an extensive advertising network.
But political pressure is building on the company. The House of Commons standing committee on access to information, privacy and ethics is holding hearings into platforms such as Pornhub. On Monday, the committee heard from Serena Fleites, 19, who had a video of her at 13 years old uploaded to the site.
Ms. Fleites, who previously told her story to The New York Times, said it took weeks for the company to remove the video after she requested it be taken down. Afterward, the video was repeatedly uploaded to the site, forcing her to prove her identity all over again to have it deleted. The mental trauma caused her to attempt suicide, she said.
"You are dealing with a rogue company," Ms. Fleites's lawyer, Michael Bowe, told the committee. "It, in fact, knowingly commercialized and monetized this type of content."
MindGeek has denied these allegations.
On Friday, Mr. Antoon and MindGeek COO David Tassillo will testify before the committee, their first ever appearance in a public setting. For years, MindGeek seemed untouchable, even as its scale stoked worries in the industry.
"Hardly anyone would speak out against MindGeek, because that's how they made their money," said Allie Eve Knox, an adult content creator in Texas.
Interviews with 15 former employees from across MindGeek, along with a review of court filings and corporate records, reveal a company that was bent on dominating the industry from the start. MindGeek favoured amassing a huge library of content, even as employees had concerns with its moderation policies. The Globe is not identifying any former employees as they fear retribution from the company.
MindGeek was an early operator of so-called tube sites, styled after YouTube, that allowed anyone to upload content and viewers to watch for free. Producers of professional adult content are subject to laws to ensure performers are of legal age and every act is consensual, but the issue is considerably more fraught on a website where anyone can upload explicit material. The tube model, however, is cheap, efficient and lucrative.
Even so, MindGeek is not immune to financial pressures. Its insatiable appetite for growth meant it had to take on a massive amount of debt that still carries an unusually high interest rate. And to pay it off, the company needs an endless supply of content.
Mr. Antoon, 46, isn't one to settle for small things, either. He's building a sprawling mansion in the north end of Montreal, and records show he and his wife own two other large properties in Quebec, including a compound in the Laurentians. Around Montreal, he drives a bright yellow Lamborghini Urus bearing a vanity licence plate, according to people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition they not be identified. The licence plate nods to his CEO status.
Mr. Antoon is an early employee of MindGeek's predecessor, joining in 2008, along with Mr. Tassillo, 43. (Mr. Antoon is also the brother-in-law of one of the original founders.) Former employees said the two make a slightly odd pair. Mr. Antoon is gregarious, even charismatic, while Mr. Tassillo is more reserved.
But there is another important figure most MindGeek employees have never seen or even heard about: an Austrian named Bernd Bergmair (also spelled Bernard Bergemar), who has listed China as his country of residence in corporate records. One former employee who met him only knew his first name.
The company they oversee is a pornographic multinational. MindGeek is registered in Luxembourg and maintains a small office there, but is primarily run from Montreal in a generic six-storey glass-sheathed building. Aside from Pornhub, it owns other popular free and subscriber-based adult sites, such as Brazzers and Reality Kings. Pornhub alone receives an average of 130 million visits a day, and regularly ranks among the most visited websites in the world.
MindGeek's operations extend beyond content. It runs an ad network called TrafficJunky across its properties, and serves up 4.6 billion ad impressions every day. A recent tagline for TrafficJunky asks: "Your customers are on Pornhub, so why aren't you?" Working at MindGeek, which employs more than 1,000 people in Canada alone, can be a strange experience. Many former employees compared it to a typical tech company - there are programmers, designers and business analysts. Others described it as an insular place, and likened it to an alternate reality. One arriving at the office for the first time was puzzled to find no desk phone. "Who are you going to call?" the former employee was told.
It has a bizarre approach to public relations, too. Try searching for any of its spokespeople and executives quoted in mainstream publications over the years. There are no social-media accounts or any mentions of them aside from articles about MindGeek.
An oft-quoted Pornhub vice-president goes by the name of Corey Price, for example, but it's not clear he exists. There is, however, a vice-president named Corey Urman involved with Pornhub. (He, too, is on the witness list for Friday's ethics committee.)
A person with knowledge of the matter said public relations staff routinely used fake names when dealing with journalists. MindGeek's spokesperson wrote the company encourages pseudonyms in some public-facing correspondence. "This is necessary because some of our personnel and their families have been victimized by threats of violence and internet-based harm," the spokesperson wrote from a Gmail address. (He refused to say whether he was using a pseudonym.)
Over the years, it's received some money from the province. The Quebec government provided MindGeek with subsidies totalling about $189,215 from 2011 to 2018 to support tech-related jobs and boost the use of French in the workplace, a spokesperson for the Labour Ministry said. MindGeek also received about $7,330 in 2018 under a provincial program encouraging individuals and companies to use electric vehicles.
MindGeek's origins can be traced back to the late 1990s, when a teenager in Brussels named Fabian Thylmann logged on to a forum for trading passwords used to access adult sites.
A self-taught programmer, he started offering his services to fledgling porn sites after connecting with others through the forum. He later co-founded a company that made software to track affiliate marketing campaigns for the adult industry, but eventually left.
In the 2000s, pay sites were starting to struggle against a growing wave of free online porn.
Mr. Thylmann swooped in to buy out floundering pay sites and realized he needed a hub to properly expand. Eventually, he settled on a company in Montreal called Mansef. Founded by some Concordia University grads, Mansef already had 200 employees, double-digit profit margins and many adult sites under its banner. At the time, Pornhub, which launched in 2007, was owned by a separate but related company.
By 2010, Mr. Thylmann had purchased Mansef, renamed it Manwin and struck a relationship with accounting and consulting firm Raymond Chabot Grant Thornton (RCGT) in Montreal to find $100-million in financing. Some other brokers became involved, including a Quebec firm called IBS Capital.
The fundraising effort later sparked byzantine litigation over commissions between Manwin, RCGT and IBS. Claude Delage, founding partner at IBS, said in court that Manwin needed money "to take global control of their business." If Manwin bought its rivals one after the next, the multiples it would have to pay by the end would be "crazy."
Instead, it made sense for Manwin to raise buckets of money and launch an acquisition blitz all at once before deals became public, Mr. Delage said.
Plus, the company had to be ambitious to entice lenders who would otherwise dismiss the deal as too small.
Manwin's raise ballooned, and court documents say the company signed a deal for US$412-million. Financial filings show Manwin ultimately took a term loan worth US$360-million.
Mr. Thylmann has said he thought differently than adult industry veterans, who were slower to move online. He applied strategies that are common now, but novel for the time - data crunching, A/B testing and user experience design.
The tube and subscriber-based sites worked together, too. Manwin offered unique content through its pay sites, and advertised them on its free properties, converting visitors into paying customers. The free sites, meanwhile, brought in huge amounts of traffic and earned money through advertising.
"This mix of the two parts was why this worked so well," Mr. Thylmann said at a conference in 2016. The setup also fostered internal competition. The pay sites were allotted budgets and purchased ad space on their tube counterparts, just like any other advertiser. Moreover, the company's video and data trove allowed it to identify trends early. If something proved popular on the tube sites, its pay sites would copy it, Mr. Thylmann said.
Later, under Mr. Antoon, MindGeek took that approach further. An article in the New York University Law Review in 2019 said MindGeek is more advanced than Netflix at mining data and using it to ensure content is tailored to viewer preferences. Scripts for videos shot for MindGeek's pay sites are detailed, sometimes specifying the furniture and carpet styles on set.
According to the Law Review article, MindGeek has determined the type of dialogue, positions and camera angles that will attract viewers.
As for Mr. Thylmann, he was charged in Germany with tax evasion in 2012, and sold Manwin the following year in what he's described as a management buyout. According to a court submission from IBS, Mr. Thylmann had stated his shares were worth roughly $500-million.
After the sale, the company dealt differently with the outside world. Mr. Thylmann, now a startup investor and nightclub owner, seemed to enjoy his role as a porn mogul, and didn't avoid publicity. That changed once the company was renamed MindGeek under the new ownership.
"MindGeek today ... is a lot more hidden than Manwin was," Mr. Thylmann said at another conference in 2017. "They went completely under the radar, making themselves obscure and not really showing anyone what it is, and who it is, and who owns it."
The beneficial owners registry in Luxembourg provides some in-
formation, at least. Records show Mr. Antoon owns 67.6 per cent of the parent company, MindGeek S.à.r.l., while Mr. Tassillo holds 32.2 per cent. Still, how could two senior employees afford to purchase such a huge company? Ownership records turn up a third name: Bernd Bergmair, a man who has left so few traces of his existence he may as well be a ghost.
In December, the Financial Times reported that Mr. Bergmair is the largest owner of MindGeek through his stakes in various subsidiaries, citing people close to the company. Two sources also confirmed to The Globe that Mr. Bergmair owns the largest stake.
Determining anything about him is tough. He was born in the Austrian city of Linz in 1968, and graduated from the University of Chicago Booth School of Business in 1994. In an alumni publication from 2002, there is a single, blurry photo of him, a slim man with dark hair and glasses, attending a gathering with fellow Austrian graduates. No one in the photo contacted by The Globe recalled meeting him.
Mr. Bergmair did visit the Montreal office, though. Mr. Antoon, according to a former employee, emphasized that Mr. Bergmair was only a small shareholder. Mr. Bergmair, dressed in an expensive suit, never said much and appeared to be the very definition of a silent partner.
How and when he got into the industry is unclear. He used to work as a banker, according to people close to the company, and court records show he was the executive officer of a Hong Kong-based firm called Bright Imperial Ltd., which owned a porn site called RedTube. Questions sent to an e-mail address for Mr. Bergmair went unanswered.
Whether he founded RedTube, purchased it or became involved in some other way is, again, unclear, but it shopped itself around in 2008. A confidential sales pitch entered as an exhibit in a lawsuit claimed the site was the "world's leading player" (Pornhub was then a distant competitor) and the sale represented a "once in a lifetime opportunity."
RedTube's business doubled every three months, and it earned a US$292,000 profit in one month. The site employed just four people (two part-time) and spent nothing on advertising.
In August, 2013, MindGeek (technically Manwin at the time) acquired RedTube's parent company, but Mr. Bergmair appears to still own a significant stake in the site.
MindGeek's corporate structure is complex, and according to its most recent financial filings in 2018, it's an amalgam of at least 48 subsidiaries in Luxembourg, Cyprus, Ireland, the U.S., Canada and Romania, among other countries. Mr. Bergmair is the majority owner of a handful of subsidiaries, including a 59.99-per-cent stake in one called RT Holding, which holds RedTube.
As part of the RedTube deal, MindGeek is required to pay certain shareholders of RT Holding large sums of money, described as an "investment incentive fee" of about US$102.5-million in instalments between 2014 and 2024. Mr. Bergmair appears to benefit in other ways. After the change of ownership in 2013, a "significant portion" of the company's royalty revenue was reallocated to other subsidiaries, including two owned by Mr. Bergmair, financial records suggest.
MindGeek's finances, which are audited by Grant Thornton, show the company has plateaued in recent years. Revenue declined by 3 per cent in 2018 from four years earlier, though it reversed substantial losses with a profit of US$22.2-million.
Still, margins have narrowed significantly from the double-digits that first enticed Mr. Thylmann years ago. That's partly because MindGeek pays a massive interest rate on the debt that has fuelled its expansion. At the end of 2017, the effective interest rate on its term loan was 20.4 per cent. In 2018, MindGeek terminated that financing agreement and secured a new US$370-million term loan with an effective rate of 11.9 per cent.
A source close to the company said Redwood Capital Management LLC in New Jersey, which focuses on distressed debt, and Roystone Capital Management LP in New York participated in the refinancing. Both firms avoid the spotlight; their websites show only a logo, a phone number and a generic e-mail address. Roystone did not respond to e-mails, while Redwood declined to comment.
A company owned by the two Reuben brothers, billionaire real estate investors from the U.K., has been a debt holder as well. A Reuben Brothers spokesperson said that a "tiny proportion" of the total debt, amounting to $3.5-million, was purchased on the company's behalf by traders advising the firm. "The shareholders, shocked to discover the true nature of the business, have immediately set to sell their stake," the spokesperson said.
Pornhub, MindGeek's most well-known site, has always strived for a friendly image, with cheeky advertising and support for social justice causes. It has also relied heavily on marketing stunts. Pornhub said it sent branded plows to clear snow in U.S. cities (though some local media reported there was little evidence it happened), crowdfunded to shoot a movie in space (that also never happened) and submitted an ad to the Super Bowl (that never aired).
Nevertheless, these stunts generated widespread media exposure, bringing the site to a wider audience, and the brand is part of popular culture. Jokes about its popularity amid lockdowns spread on Twitter last year, its jingle became a meme on TikTok and Saturday Night Live released a parody commercial.
But many providers in the adult industry have taken issue with Pornhub, in part because of pirated content on the site over the years. MindGeek said it uses digital fingerprinting to prevent pirated content from being uploaded, but creators say part of the onus is still on them to monitor for stolen content and file takedown requests.
"It's near constant," said Liara Roux, an independent performer in New York. She pays a company about US$250 every month to monitor for her videos and issue takedown notices to Pornub and other sites. "It's no small amount that it's costing me."
At one point, she felt she had no choice but to put her videos on Pornhub and earn some revenue from the site. But the arrangement felt exploitational, and she started hearing stories about the difficulties some people had when requesting non-consensual content be removed.
"For me, it was like, I don't want to be participating in this," she said. Last year, Ms. Roux closed her account.
A December column in The New York Times reported that Pornhub hosts videos of child rape and revenge porn. MindGeek initially denied the claims. Internally, Mr. Antoon pushed back as well, calling allegations that Pornhub profits from child sexual abuse material and other non-consensual videos to be "factually untrue," according to an e-mail he wrote to staff obtained by The Globe.
He lamented media coverage in another e-mail. "[T]his is unfortunately part of the challenges we will continue to face," he wrote, ending on an optimistic note. "There is no better time than the beginning of a new year to start a new chapter."
The Times opinion piece was not the first to take issue with Pornhub's moderation policies, nor to call attention to illegal material on the site. The Internet Watch Foundation, a U.K. non-profit, reported 118 incidents of child sexual abuse material on Pornhub from the start of 2017 to October, 2019, for example.
Still, it was only in the wake of the Times column that Mastercard and Visa cut off the website. (The ban affects the sale of individual video clips sold by performers through Pornhub, as well as premium memberships to the site.)
The company quickly implemented sweeping changes to Pornhub, removing millions of videos posted by unverified accounts, prohibiting uploads from such users and implementing new criteria to verify users, among other changes.
Pornhub called these steps "the most comprehensive safeguards in user-generated platform history."
The company says it uses a variety of automated technologies to detect illegal material, along with an "extensive team" of human moderators.
"We will not tolerate illegal content on our platforms, including non-consensual material and child sexual abuse material," the company said in a statement.
MindGeek will not say how many moderators it employs, however. There is a group of employees in Montreal, known as content formatters, who prepare material to go online and also screen user-uploaded videos for inappropriate material. Formatters were told a team in Cyprus first flagged videos that did not meet MindGeek's terms of service, such as material depicting children.
But if the content is not professionally produced, determining the ages of those in user-uploaded videos and whether it's even consensual is ultimately impossible, according to former content formatters interviewed by The Globe, whose tenures spanned from 2012 to 2020.
On a typical day, a formatter could review between 100 and 200 videos. They don't watch videos from start to finish, but instead click through at various points. The amount of videos employees were expected to review could be overwhelming, and one said formatters had around two minutes with each one. Any extra time spent assessing whether something violated the company's guidelines created the risk of falling behind.
If they encountered videos that were clearly illegal, the content was quickly removed, formatters said. But difficulties arose if a video fell into a grey area, such as if it looked homemade or when trying to assess if someone was intoxicated, which would violate the terms of service. In cases where a content formatter was uncertain, a senior employee would make the decision.
Two former employees said that more often than not, managers favoured approving videos, rather than removing them.
Sometimes managers would spot a tattoo, and use that as evidence that a person was of legal age and presumably consenting.
Occasionally, employees flagged content so egregious they recommended contacting the police. But two former formatters said they were discouraged by managers from doing so. One was told not to bother, since uploaders are typically anonymous and unlikely to be identifiable.
MindGeek did not address specific questions from The Globe, but noted in a statement it works with "non-profit organizations and law enforcement authorities" to stop the spread of illegal material.
Pay is low. The starting salary for a content formatter was $30,000 in 2012, and it was not much higher in 2020. The job also took a heavy mental toll on employees. One former formatter still thinks about the disturbing videos he saw, while another sought therapy just a few weeks into the role and soon quit.
The impact of the suspension from Mastercard and Visa on MindGeek is hard to gauge, and neither Visa nor Mastercard commented on what it would take to ever restore service. The only way to pay for a premium Pornhub account today is with cryptocurrency.
There are signs of strain. In a company-wide e-mail last month, Mr. Antoon wrote MindGeek had not met its financial targets for 2020. Still, MindGeek is a sprawling entity. It can continue to earn ad revenue and sell memberships to its other properties.
In the meantime, Pornhub still has work to do to clean up its platform. Even after it removed millions of videos in December, it's not hard to find questionable content.
One verified account hosts numerous screen captures from Omegle, a video chat service that randomly pairs up users. In the videos, a man pleasures himself in front of those he's been matched with, some of whom look to be teenaged girls, their faces fully visible.
Another account has a compilation video of women on Omegle exposing themselves (whether they all consented to have their images live on Pornhub is highly unlikely). The compilation video also includes a clip of three girls who look to be underaged goofing around and making lewd gestures.
After The Globe inquired, the videos disappeared from Pornhub.

Full text: Sixty years ago, the influential American architect Philip Johnson - curator, tastemaker, modernist pioneer and Nazi sympathizer - designed a penthouse apartment on top of a Toronto office building.
Or did he? That's the question now facing a couple of Toronto design aficionados who now own the place, a two-level 10,000-square-foot apartment overlooking the rooftops of Yorkville. Gerald Sheff and Shanitha Kachan are planning to renovate portions of the place, and they've hired the globally prominent Toronto architects Shim-Sutcliffe.
However, the City of Toronto's heritage planners have other ideas. After months of negotiations, the Shim-Sutcliffe design proposal has been largely rejected by the city's heritage planners. On Friday, Sheff and Kachan went to the Toronto Preservation Board for permission to proceed and lost on a 6-5 vote. Toronto City Council will make a final decision this week.
This has involved a months-long war of words between Toronto city staff and private consultants, on several different fronts. How much of the apartment did Johnson, a towering figure in 20th-century architecture, actually design? How should new architecture relate to heritage architecture? The stand-off also raises questions about how far into private homes preservation should be able to reach.
In a recent interview, Sheff sounded exasperated about all this. "The idea of a heritage easement in a private apartment seems to me a little nutty," he said. "This is a place that almost no one will ever see. But in any case, what we want to do is superior to what's there."
The retired co-founder of wealth management firm Gluskin Sheff, Sheff started his career as an architect, and the couple has a long record as design patrons and philanthropists. They've previously commissioned houses from top Canadian architects KPMB and from Shim-Sutcliffe.
Their next project was the Toronto apartment, which was listed for sale in 2018 for $31.5-million. "It's an opportunity for us to create an amazing space, and save its most significant heritage aspects," he added.
Those heritage aspects largely go back to Johnson. In the late 1950s, his face and trademark round black glasses were familiar in the New York architecture and art worlds. For decades, he had been a curator (and board member and donor and architect) at the Museum of Modern Art. His 1932 exhibition on "The International Style" had popularized European modernism in North America. And much more: He would live to the age of 98, long enough to shape half a century's worth of ideas in architecture.
But in 1959 or 1960, he was apparently having lunch with a Torontonian named Rose Torno. Torno and her husband, Noah, were designing their Toronto apartment - which would be perched on the roof of a new office building in Yorkville, designed by the local architects Bregman & Hamann. Noah Torno was an executive at a wine business owned by the Bronfman family of Montreal, who owned the Yorkville building, and an advisor to patriarch Sam Bronfman.
Very little paperwork directly links Johnson to the project. His name is on none of the known architectural drawings of the place. But 30 years later, Noah Torno wrote a glowing letter to Johnson, thanking him for his work. Johnson answered in 1994 with a note that was warm, but also equivocal: "I don't know about the design. I think it was yours more than mine."
One part of the suite clearly bears Johnson's influence: its central atrium, which has the shimmery glamour of a mid-century museum lobby. It's a near-cube lined with beige travertine; a bronze and stone stair ascends from the lower floor to the upper under a textured, backlit ceiling.
This space is mostly intact, and everyone agrees it is Johnson-esque. "It's a very close match for the stair at the Four Seasons restaurant," said heritage architect Michael McClelland of ERA, who is collaborating with Shim-Sutcliffe.
The Four Seasons was the power-lunch restaurant at the Seagram Building in New York.
The black-and-bronze headquarters for Samuel Bronfman's liquor empire was designed in 1959 by Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, a giant of modern architecture. Bronfman's daughter Phyllis Lambert - later the influential founder of the Canadian Centre for Architecture - lobbied for Mies to get the job, and worked together with Mies and Johnson on the project.
The Four Seasons was Johnson's baby. He used details borrowed from Mies, who was his hero and mentor, including travertine and English oak, but Johnson added a certain theatrical flair.
Carefully controlled lighting behind translucent screens gave the restaurateurs the ability to control the ambience; and that stair, which took people up to the main dining room, was a place to see and be seen.
Johnson would lunch at the Four Seasons regularly for almost a half-century. In 1959, he apparently met Rose Torno there. Lambert remembers the relationship: "I remember Philip talking about it, talking about Rose and this grand gallery in the apartment," she said. Drawings from Toronto were sent to Johnson's office for approval between July, 1959, and January, 1960. The Tornos also hired two people who worked on the Four Seasons: the lighting designer Richard Kelly and the landscape architect Karl Linn.
Mark Lamster, author of the 2018 Johnson biography The Man In The Glass House, said the Torno place was never listed as a project in Johnson's office files, or included in books about his work.
"It was probably some minor thing for a friend of a friend," he suggested. "That central atrium certainly has a Johnson look to it, but he never claimed it as his own work."
It would be characteristic for Johnson to do a napkin sketch, McClelland said, and then delegate most of the detailed design.
Lambert concurs that the architect did not busy himself with small labours: "Even the stair in the atrium - Philip didn't draw things like that himself," she said.
Instead, someone in Johnson's office probably did, and the Toronto architects copied, or even traced, the relevant drawings.
All this might be ancient history - except for a complex real estate deal and some questionable research.
In 2007, after the Tornos had both died, the private equity firm KingSett Capital purchased the 14-storey building to capitalize on the valuable airspace above it.
With Quadrangle Architects, they added six floors of condos to the existing building. Designbuilder Joe Brennan gutted much of the Torno place, reshaping servants' quarters, the kitchen and mechanical room. For what was left, the owners agreed with the city on a "heritage easement agreement," legally protecting many specific details.
In Toronto, and anywhere on the continent, it's rare to protect details of a domestic interior. But the city's hasty listing of the "heritage attributes" is also, McClelland suggests, not very accurate.
"It was expedient," he said. "If anyone had done the research, they'd know that there are pieces there that Johnson didn't even know existed."
There is much confusion over the details, but the differences seem to be over this: Johnson (or a staffer) designed the atrium, and may have had some input on some surrounding rooms, including a living room-library downstairs and a principal bedroom suite upstairs. But the bulk of those rooms were designed by the Tornos' local architects and their interior designer, T.H. Robsjohn-Gibbings. Some of the finishes, including a parquet de Versailles floor, are distinctly not modernist, and the Tornos' furniture - captured in photographs in the 1960s - appears to come from their previous apartment in Forest Hill, a few kilometres away.
"Johnson was certainly here, in some way, but it was never a total work of art," architect Brigitte Shim of Shim-Sutcliffe said.
The apartment's mix of modern and "traditional" provides a jumping-off point for the new architects: the husband-and-wife team of Shim and Howard Sutcliffe. Toronto natives, they're known for their obsessive craftsmanship and a very high level of formal and technical refinement, in buildings from modest houses up to the Integral House, one of the grandest dwellings in the country.
In this case, Shim said, they aim to tread lightly. "Our work here is fairly nuanced - taking the existing plan, not changing the rooms much in terms of their space or function, but making the ensemble more coherent," she said.
Building on the pattern in the parquet floor and the textured ceiling in the atrium, they are designing a new textured wooden ceiling with a diamond-grid pattern that spans several of the apartment's rooms.
Their design would also move some doorways, and create a continuous corridor with cast-bronze flooring around the edges of the atrium.
"This would create a clarity about the atrium, and make it read as an object," Sutcliffe said. It would wrap Johnson's pristine modern box in a textured ribbon.
That is not necessarily a conflict. Johnson was no doctrinaire modernist; by the 1960s, he was openly working to bring classical ideas back into contemporary architecture. And even the Torno atrium itself, as McClelland points out, owes a debt to the 19th-century neoclassical architect Karl Friedrich Schinkel. For Mies and for Johnson, modern architecture did not break completely with the past.
But City of Toronto heritage planners are having none of this.
"City staff are concerned that aspects of the current proposal remove original and unique interior features that exemplify the apartment's unique modernist aesthetic and the work of Philip Johnson," Mary MacDonald, the senior manager of heritage planning with the city, said in an email last week.
In Toronto, heritage conservation routinely sees a building's front façade being kept while the other 99 per cent gets demolished. Yet, the Toronto Preservation Board discussion of the Torno place turned on extraordinarily fine questions. These include some changes to the room layout (including moving a doorway that has previously been moved); the material to be used for a ceiling; the removal of some built-in bookcases and cabinetry in the library; and the demolition of a bathroom.
Is all that Johnson's handiwork? McClelland guesses no.
City staff disagree. "In their minds, Johnson designed every piece of the place, and it must stay as is," McClelland said.
That is, basically, what city staff are saying, but the record is murky at best. The library and bathroom fittings resemble Johnson's work of the time, but there's no record that he or his staff designed them. The room layout was reviewed by Johnson's office, but on paper it is the work of Bregman & Hamann.
In a sense, the city's fervent desire to preserve this modern architecture represents progress.
The field of heritage preservation in North America was shaped by the battles of the 1960s and 70s, in which modern buildings were the stuff that replaced heritage.
Postwar buildings are now sometimes overlooked. For instance: the Tornos' former home, an apartment building designed by Toronto architects Gordon S.
Adamson Associates. It won a national architecture award in 1952.
But it is still not listed, and recently received unsympathetic new windows and a coat of grey paint on its pristine yellow brick.
So the focus on the Torno place is odd - all the more so because it deals with an interior.
MacDonald acknowledges that preservation usually "focuses on the conservation of the heritage resources that are visible from the public realm." This creates an awkward situation for Kachan and Sheff, who care deeply about architecture.
Along with their two houses, and much support of the Canadian Centre for Architecture, they ran a public design competition that recognized the emerging architect Lukasz Kos in 2002. Sheff won a national award in 2011 as an "advocate for architecture."
They are "the best clients imaginable for this place," Shim said.
"It's impossible for the apartment to end up in better hands."
Kachan argues that the changes they want to make to the apartment will actually make it better. "What we'd like to do is far superior to the way the place has been treated in the last few years," she said. "Right now, the apartment is unresolved, and it deserves to be elevated."
One thing is for certain: Since 2007, the apartment has been changed many times. Walls have been moved, rooms reshaped, a new kitchen built in a different location and more, by Brennan and then by a subsequent owner.
In a 100-page research report submitted to the city, ERA identify 21 separate renovation projects between 2007 and 2017. "It's a mishmash of later alterations," McClelland said.
Fundamentally, there are two questions here: How much of value is left? And how should new architecture interact with heritage architecture - by deferring to it or by engaging with it?
On the first point, Sheff, Kachan and their consultants have concluded that only the atrium is Johnsonian and therefore sacrosanct. The city disagrees, and before approving other changes they want MacDonald to have the power of final review over most details.
On the second point, there's a complicating factor when it comes to Johnson: He was a Nazi.
As Lamster documents in his biography, he collaborated with and likely spied for Nazi Germany, narrowly escaping prison after the Second World War.
In the early 1930s, he and his friend Alan Blackburn also worked to establish a National Party, "an alt-right avant la lettre," in Lamster's telling, associating with Huey Long and Father Charles Coughlin. Johnson openly expressed an admiration for eugenics.
All this is being widely discussed at the moment, thanks largely to Lamster's recent book.
"It is interesting to be having this conversation at a moment when American institutions are trying to distance themselves from Johnson," the author said.
Harvard's Graduate School of Design has taken his name off a house Johnson designed and built there. MoMA is considering similar steps.
Does this mean Johnson should be written out of history?
No one seems to think so. In life, he had many Jewish friends and clients, including the Bronfmans, who "were aware of his history" as a Nazi sympathizer, Lamster said.
But Lamster suggests that such a minor and disputed Johnson work could be updated "especially by Shim-Sutcliffe," he said.
"You can't get better architects anywhere." This is a more liberal view of heritage conservation, which some professionals share: that architecture of the past and present can exist in conversation with each other, particularly when the new is as intentional as the old.
But it's hard to see a compromise here. While the Tornos may have gone halfway, and Johnson may have been half-involved, Shim-Sutcliffe are famous for pursuing architecture as a coherent whole. Sheff and Kachan, likewise, aren't inclined to budge.
"To do something halfway," Kachan said, "is just not in our nature."

Full text: 18757 County Rd 2 Road., Summerstown, Ont.
CORNWALL Asking price: $1,399,000 (August, 2020) Selling price: $1,225,000 (October, 2020) Taxes: $12,700 (2020) Days on the market: 56 Listing agents: Raymond Chin and Julie Clement, Coldwell Banker First Ottawa Realty THE ACTION This two-storey house on a ten-acre lot near the St. Lawrence River outside Cornwall was initially priced for sale at $1.75million, but with local properties averaging between $500,000 to $700,000, it struggled to find a buyer. Over a four-year span, the asking price dropped to $1.399million and, relisted with new agents and re-staged, an offer finally emerged at $1,225,000 this October.
"It's considered very high end for that price point, and it's in a part of Ontario that doesn't have a big population, either, so those were the challenges for brokers listing this property," agent Raymond Chin said.
"We were targeting international buyers and people who may have lived in Cornwall before and wanted to move back or bring their business ... [and] work from that house because there's so much space."
WHAT THEY GOT The 33-year-old house makes the most of southfacing views of the river with large windows, an upper balcony and a wraparound veranda that extends above the triple garage.
The interior layout offers the standard dining and living rooms, in addition to open entertaining areas on the main and lower levels. The upstairs family room has vaulted beamed ceilings and a wood-burning fireplace.
A private bathroom, walk-in closet and office are are attached to the largest bedroom. At the opposite end of the home are three more bedrooms, including one upstairs off a secondary kitchen and living area.
THE AGENT'S TAKE "It's a 7,000square-foot home, it's on 10 acres you own and you face the St. Lawrence River, so you see big cruise and freight ships come by," Mr. Chin said.
"And there's a parcel of land at the water itself where you can build your own dock or park your own ship."

Full text: Since it was built in the late 1980s, one downtown Toronto bank tower has stood out for its distinctive slim profile, red granite cladding and energyconserving reflective windows.
Beyond its physical appearance, the 68-storey tower at 40 King St. W. now stands apart as Canada's largest zero carbon certified building. In awarding the designation last year, Canada Green Building Council president Thomas Mueller said it "validates that zero carbon buildings - whether new builds or retrofits - are both technically and financially feasible for owners willing to innovate and invest in a low carbon future for Canada."
That future looms large for the commercial real estate sector, whose building operations and materials account for about 30 per cent of carbon emissions, according to the federal government. Last month, Ottawa announced plans to raise its carbon tax to $170 a tonne by 2030, up from $30 currently, as part of the federal response to climate change. Meanwhile, from various quarters, calls intensify for action on sustainability measures.
"The investor community has become very engaged and is driving the direction the world economy is taking [on carbon emissions] even more than government," says Deloitte partner Henry Stoch, Vancouver-based leader of the consultant firm's sustainability and climate change practice. He also cites a "massive shift in expectations" by a younger generation for buildings and employers that demonstrate environmental values.
Some major building owners, such as those of 40 King St. W., have chosen to get ahead of the curve on emissions reduction by establishing long-term road maps to reduce the carbon footprint of their properties.
"I would say a good ESG [environmental, social and governance] strategy is playing offence, not defence, and we are playing offence," says Jon Love, chief executive officer and founder of KingSett Capital Inc., a co-owner of Scotia Plaza (which includes 40 King) since 2016. "We think over a long period of time it will be increasingly valued by our investors, employees, suppliers, tenants and our various constituents; that is the long-term payback." Last November, Mr. Love's private equity real estate investment firm with $18.4-billion of assets ranked first in North America in an annual ranking of global real estate owners who integrate sustainability measures into company and fund practices.
The strategy of KingSett and like-minded building owners "could turn out to be the smart money play," says University of Waterloo sustainable building researcher John Straube, an associate professor with the department of civil and environmental engineering and the School of Architecture, citing rising costs of carbon and the growing appeal of environmentally friendly office space.
Over the 30-year-plus life of 40 King, successive owners have invested in energy efficiency and other updates. Since purchasing the property, KingSett has spent about $8-million in upgrades that include energy-saving lighting and technology improvements to building automation systems. In 2018, the building received platinum certification under the green building council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design scorecard for efficiently run operations and maintenance. Over the past five years, the carbon emission intensity of 40 King has dropped 55 per cent while earning other third-party certifications for air quality, according to KingSett.
In early 2020, after a review of KingSett's ESG strategy to accelerate carbon neutrality across the portfolio, officials selected 40 King for a zero-carbon pilot project. The bank tower already was well on its way to carbon neutrality because it mostly ran on electricity, not natural gas, and used thermal tanks that generate cool air in off-peak hours for use on hot days.
"We chose an asset that would yield the least burden so we could learn the most out of the process and apply it to other properties," KingSett director of sustainability Kit Milnes says.
Last year, the company planned to replace the few remaining non-electricity systems in the building, including a natural gasheated underground garage, to cut carbon emissions. But the coronavirus pandemic disrupted the timetable, Mr. Milnes says, with conversions now to be completed by this fall.
One of KingSett's allies in attaining zero carbon certification for 40 King is the lead tenant, the Bank of Nova Scotia. A former owner of the building, the bank has its own decarbonization agenda that includes spending $100-billion by 2025 to fight climate change.
"As a tenant, it is very difficult to get to the finish line without strong partnerships from our landlords," says Darren Da Silva, vice-president, asset management and special projects for Scotiabank's real estate division.
"Large tenants and landlords need to be partners and go hand in hand," he adds. "Understand there may be some incremental upfront costs, but it pays back both economically and in the productivity of the employees."
Decarbonizing 40 King, though hard to see with the naked eye, affects everyone in the building, Mr. Da Silva says.
"Air quality has always been topnotch," he says. "This was about delivering that air quality with less electricity." When the bank had to confirm new global standards for coronavirus protection, he says Scotia Plaza (which includes the original bank building) already exceeded them.
Even with various carbonsqueezing efforts, including in the building's food court, KingSett still needed some offsets (permitted under the certification) for 40 King to qualify for recognition. Mr. Milnes said his company only chose environmental projects, such as a reforestation project in East Timor, where the offsets generated meaningful local impact.
Zero carbon advocates hope others follow KingSett's lead in developing a carbon-reduction road map for their properties.
Typically, building owners schedule capital improvements, including energy audits and heating and cooling system upgrades, says Fin MacDonald, manager of the green building council's zero carbon program. "One thing they were never doing was looking at how to transition from fossil fuels; that is the new piece."
Since the introduction of the council's certification program three years ago, about 60 property owners have signed on to develop carbon emission reduction plans. "Carbon has to be the question that we ask if we are going to solve this climate change problem," Mr. MacDonald says.
While 40 King grabbed the headlines - and other big carbon reduction projects are pending for KingSett - Mr. Love also praises small-scale achievements. For example, his company recently upgraded a dozen lights in a downtown Toronto office lobby.
"There was no glamour, but it cut the electricity cost by 90 per cent," he says.
Mr. Love, who describes the move to zero carbon buildings as "evolution, not revolution," emphasizes the value of a long-term plan, and staying ambitious about outcomes. "I'd be disappointed if we followed just that [plan] and we were not able to accelerate."

Full text: Canada's housing market jumped in December, closing out the year with record sales and prices as buyers competed fiercely for larger properties during the pandemic.
There were 551,392 home resales last year, a 13-per-cent increase over 2019, with suburbs and smaller markets recording some of the biggest gains, according to the report from the Canadian Real Estate Association.
That topped 2016, the previous record-setting year for resales, when demand surged in Toronto and Vancouver.
Although those two cities had higher sales and prices last year, remote work pushed city residents to the suburbs and further afield. As a result, price increases were steeper in places such as the Quinte region of Ontario compared with the rest of the country.
Over all, the home price index, which corrects for expensive transactions, was up 13 per cent year-over-year to a record high of $661,700 in December. In Quinte (located about two hours east of Toronto), Simcoe County, Woodstock-Ingersoll and the Lakelands region in Ontario's cottage country, the index was up more than 30 per cent. The residential real estate market was one of a few sectors that benefited from the pandemic, with interest-rate cuts pushing mortgage rates to record lows. The common five-year fixed mortgage rate has been below 2 per cent for months, making it easier for homeowners to borrow and pay down their mortgages.
Every province recorded higher sales, with Saskatchewan up 25 per cent year-over-year, followed by British Columbia at 21.6 per cent and Quebec at 17 per cent.
Newfoundland and Labrador, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia all increased between 13 per cent and 15 per cent. Sales in Ontario, the most populated province, were up 9 per cent.
A shortage of properties for sale has contributed to the rise in prices. Across the country, new listings were 4 per cent lower than 2019. The combination of tight supply and low mortgage rates is expected to push prices higher this year. The Canadian Real Estate Association has forecast the average selling price to rise 9 per cent this year, to $620,400.
Months of remote work and stayat-home requirements pushed homebuyers to seek more space and backyards. Working from home made it possible for buyers to move to more affordable areas such as Moncton. Restricted foreign travel also enticed wealthier residents to buy properties in vacation locations across the country, such as Whistler, B.C., and Kawartha Lakes, Ont.
Over all, that sent up prices of detached houses and depressed the value of condos. The price index for houses in Canada was up 16 per cent year over year, while the index for condos was up 4 per cent, according to CREA.
Since the pandemic started, the migration out of major cities has accelerated. A record number of residents in Toronto and Montreal left for the nearby suburbs in the 12 months to July, according to Statistics Canada. The movement is reflected in falling condo rent and rising condo listings in both cities. In Toronto, condos were the only property type to lose value over the year, according to the local real estate board.

Full text: More and more people are fleeing Toronto and Montreal for nearby regions, a long-standing trend tied to worsening home affordability and aggravated by the pandemic.
Over a 12-month period ending July 1, 2020, and overlapping with the first wave of the pandemic, the metropolitan area of Toronto saw a net intraprovincial outflow of 50,375 people, according to Statistics Canada figures released Thursday. That means 50,375 more people left the Toronto area for other parts of Ontario than moved in - a record high according to data going back almost two decades. The outflow was also acute in the Montreal area, which saw a net intraprovincial loss of almost 25,000 people - another record high, about 11,000 more than the previous year. Montreal was hit especially hard by COVID-19 in the spring. Both census metropolitan areas (CMAs) saw their populations continue to grow, though, owing mainly to international migration.
"Personal health, the ability to work remotely and higher housing costs are among the most important factors contributing to the decision of many Canadians to continue (or to no longer continue) living in large urban centres hardest hit by the pandemic," Statscan said.
The agency did not say how much of the exodus occurred after the health crisis began. However, the numbers appear to confirm the anecdotal evidence: Thousands of Canadians have reacted to the pandemic by moving to smaller cities and towns.
The migration is a complicated trend. It has added dynamism and tax revenue to smaller locales. But it has also driven up housing costs in places that were once immune to big-city prices, creating a barrier to home ownership for locals.
"You're seeing more rural areas shift into high demand" for housing, said Royal Bank of Canada chief executive officer Dave McKay at a virtual conference Monday.
At the same event, Bank of Nova Scotia CEO Brian Porter said the bank's mortgage business grew 5.5 per cent last year, with even stronger growth to start 2021. "It's broad-based across the country," he said, pointing to such hotspots as Penticton, B.C., Brandon and Moncton.
The exodus from Toronto was apparent in places such as nearby Oshawa, where the population rose 2.1 per cent over the 12 months ending mid-2020, the fastest growth in the country for a census metropolitan area, defined as an area with a total population of at least 100,000, of which 50,000 or more live in the core.
The increase, Statscan said, was partly driven by migration from Toronto, whereas the population increases of the municipalities of Farnham (5.2 per cent) and Saint-Hippolyte (4.1 per cent) in Quebec were influenced by the outflow of people from Montreal.
Treat Hull, a real estate broker in Ontario's Prince Edward County, has seen the pandemic impact up close. Located about 200 kilometres east of Toronto, the county already had a competitive real estate market. But the health crisis kicked activity into overdrive, with monthly sales volumes in 2020 often double those of an already strong 2019.
"It's been an insane year," Mr. Hull said. "I wouldn't go so far as to call it panic-buying, but let's just say it's mainly been buyers from Toronto - and many of them have an acute sense of urgency about wanting to get out of Toronto."
The big change in demand, he observed, stems from two-adult households with both people suddenly able to work remotely, allowing them to look further afield for housing.
Indeed, labour figures show a massive rise in remote work. As of December, roughly 4.8 million Canadians worked from home - a new situation for 2.8 million of them. The majority of workers in three white-collar industries - professional and scientific services, finance and insurance, and public administration - worked from home.
Despite the departures, Canada's big cities continue to expand. That's because other components of population change - notably, international migration - played a big role. CMAs grew 1.3 per cent over all in the most recent year, less than in the previous year (1.7 per cent), but still more than non-CMA regions (0.6 per cent). The Toronto and Montreal areas grew 1.4 per cent and 0.7 per cent, respectively.
While immigration has plummeted because of the pandemic, international migration still accounted for 90 per cent of the population growth in Canada's CMAs.
The coming year should see continuing migration out of Toronto and other major cities. The average selling price of a home in the Greater Toronto Area last year was a record $930,000 - partly because of historically cheap mortgage rates.
The flipside is smaller communities are increasingly under pressure. Mr. Hull said there's little inventory of home listings in Prince Edward County at the moment, making it challenging for some locals to become homeowners.
"The influx of often highly successful and accomplished mid-career professionals and knowledge workers is definitely having an impact on the community," he said.
"We already have a critical shortage of affordable housing to begin with."

The struggles of building a laneway house

Full text: When we signed the contract with a local company to design and build a laneway house in the yard behind our 1909 Edwardian, so that my husband's daughter and her husband could have a place to live in Vancouver that wouldn't bankrupt them or us, they had one child.
By the time Ariel and Brad moved in last October, there were three children.
It was almost five years to the day after I wrote the first $10,000 cheque. Four-plus years of going through city hall hoops and hurdles, sliding down the snake and going back up the ladder, and then eight months of construction. And now the former toddler was in Grade 2, heading off to school with a backpack.
People like my husband and I are increasingly common in Canada's expensive cities: rookie private developers who don't really have a clue about what we're doing, thrust into a strange new world of construction management as we try to find new housing in the city for children, parents or even ourselves.
City politicians are encouraging that more and more in highcost cities, campaigning on promises of allowing more leeway for people who own singlefamily homes to add basement suites and laneway houses. In some cases, they're encouraging owners to demolish the old place and build a duplex, a fourplex or even, in Vancouver, a sixplex - if Mayor Kennedy Stewart's latest initiative ever gets traction.
There's a reason for this sea change from what it was 30 years ago, when basement suites were controversial. In a city with a housing shortage and constant pressure to create more, it's attractive for politicians to encourage homeowners to become the developers themselves instead of having the pros do it. We amateurs can make a personal plea to have others on the block support their development application.
So I'm here to tell you what that is like exactly or, at least, what it was like from our end of the telescope.
I'm sure that people on the other end - experienced builders or experienced city-hall buildingpermit issuers - will roll their eyes at parts of my tale. "How could she not know that!," they'll say to themselves. But that's the point.
We didn't always know and we often couldn't have any clue what was going to happen next, because it was our first, and likely only time, through the process.
We don't get to learn from project to project, the way professional builders do.
Things that might seem completely obvious to someone used to reading plans or negotiating construction budgets or complying with city processes were not at all obvious to us. ("Oh, this line here is a property line on the plan? I didn't know that," is just one of the many dippy things I said at various points.)
So this story isn't just for you future rookies to educate yourselves before you jump off that cliff. It's also for the people who are frustrated with us at the other end, because you have to deal with us when we're confused and sometimes angry and sometimes clueless.
I'll kill some of the suspense here and say that, in the end, we have a completely lovely house and that we think our construction manager was a hero. But... So here is how it started.
When my husband's daughter and her family moved back to Vancouver, after eight years away in the east, it didn't take long for us to register the fact that it was going to be difficult for them to buy anything to live in. They were making more than the region's median income between them as swim coaches, but that wasn't enough.
Because I've worked as a reporter covering Vancouver city hall for more than two decades, I'd covered the city's many efforts to find ways to create more housing. The laneway house program had officially kicked off in 2009, so I thought i knew the concept.
We had a special reason to be interested in laneway houses, because of the particular zone that our house is in. Most people who want to build laneway houses in Vancouver are restricted to about 750 square feet for a standard 33foot-by-120 foot-lot. But our 1909 house is in an older neighbourhood of Vancouver, Mount Pleasant, where the zoning is different from the standard residential one that covers most of the city. It is one of several older neighbourhoods that ring the downtown where there are a fair number of early-20th-century houses.
In an effort to prevent the demolition of the older Craftsmans, Edwardians and occasional Victorians, the city started a program in the 1980s that would allow owners to add fairly large infill houses in return for an agreement to preserve the older house.
It had been quite successful in Kitsilano, where mini-me houses sprouted in side and backyards. It was less common where we were.
But, as the price of housing started going up precipitously, a few owners in our area started using that program, often called "heritage light" or a Heritage Revitalization Agreement. We discovered we appeared to be eligible and that we could build a house of 950 square feet or more.
So I wrote the cheque in October, 2015 to a company called Smallworks, whose owner, Jake Fry, pioneered laneway housing in Vancouver. We signed a designbuild contract for what stuck in my mind as "a laneway house that will cost $350,000," and we set off.
The first thing you learn is that it takes almost a year of having your builder/architect negotiate with the city before you even apply for a development permit.
In the early batch of almost 300 e-mails that are in my files, we hacked our way laboriously through the dense undergrowth of early planning. We had the site meeting (in November), then some conferencing with the-then company architect over what his early conversations with city planners had established about how much square footage we would be allowed (December), then more meetings to come up with a preliminary design (January), then the developed design (February) and then the updated floor plan (March).
But things slowly ground to a halt at the city. At first, it seemed like just a small glitch; a new rule requiring 12 feet of clearance from main house to side property line. That kind of clearance was something that didn't exist anywhere in the neighbourhood I lived in, because the big, old houses were built so close together.
Others in my neighbourhood were running into the same problem. "We also were broadsided by this reversal in city policy," was one post on the Facebook group from "Rob" in our area. "I was quite far along on an infill proposal until I recently met with a city planning staff and got shot down."
But, it turned out, that wasn't the worst. Soon, the news started trickling out that some senior planner at the city thought there were too many of these HRA infills starting to pop up. The rules were too variable. Or something.
By late 2016, we were at a complete standstill. "Any clue for us what is going on?" was the subject line on Dec. 16.
This is the first of a four-part series.

Full text: 105 Marsdale Dr.
ST. CATHARINES, ONT.
Price: $1,888,000 Lot size: 100 feet by 128 feet Taxes: $9,713.00 (2020) Agent: Karl Vanderkuip, Broker, Re/Max Garden City Uphouse Realty THE BACKSTORY Architects and critics have trotted out many ways to describe the design philosophy behind mid-century modern homes, but Elizabeth Loomis may have landed on the most Canadian terminology for how her home functions: She calls it a mullet.
"Business up front, party in the back," she said.
The 3,000-square-foot home in St. Catharines, Ont., presents as a low-profile bungalow from the street, but like many homes of its era it seeks to create a privacy screen from passersby while the interior brings light and nature inside with sightlines from the main foyer through to a wall of windows on the rear of the house to the terraced deck and poolside. It has a number of features in common with a more famous mid-century ranch house designed by the same architect - James Secord - on nearby Wood Dale Avenue, which was awarded a silver Massey Medal for architecture in 1961.
As a child, Ms. Loomis lived about 50 houses down the road, and would ride her bike past the home all the time. "I loved the house. ... I would park my bike and stare at the house and study its lines," she said. She went on to study design at the Ontario College of Art and Design and worked in advertising for 20 years. In 2001, she was pregnant with what would be her only child and arrived for a showing to a house across the street from 105 Marsdale Dr.
Keen to know whether her dream home was available, her realtor told her she could arrange an introduction to the owner - Robin Stewart, co-founder of Stewart & Hinan Construction and a local legend in the building trade.
What followed was an interview of sorts with Mr. Stewart, who had built the house for himself and his wife, Yvette. "We were told, ‘This house has been full of parties and joy and wonderful moments,' " Ms. Loomis said, and while the couple had not planned to sell, they thought a young couple might be a fitting successor. "I think it mattered to him that I was a designer. I think he trusted I would be a steward of the property, that I would maintain the integrity of the home."
And over the past 20 years that's what she has tried to do, keeping the structure of the home intact while updating interiors and changing some of its materials.
"The house was clad in cedar, there was a lot of natural wood and the maintenance was prohibitive ... was thousands of dollars every year to maintain the wood," Ms. Loomis said. The cladding was replaced with stucco, a wood pergola in the rear was replaced with powder-coated steel, but the lines she had admired were retained. Most of her efforts went into the interiors, some getting nearly a full gut (such as the kitchen) and others just updated and brightened to fit 21st-century tastes.
"This is the very first time in 60 years the home has come for sale to the public," listing agent Karl Vanderkuip said. The price point is raising eyebrows in St. Catharines, a town better known as a retirement community for snowbirds seeking quick access to Buffalo's airport. But much of the interest has come from Toronto - two or more hours away with traffic. "In the last year the pandemic has allowed for more families and entrepreneurs that have moved from Toronto," Mr. Vanderkuip said. "I've put in a few families who've moved to the area that were almost looking at being renters in Toronto that are able to get into a very comfortable middle class home here, for $600,000."
THE HOUSE TODAY The foyer provides a good template for what visitors are going to experience in every room in the house: a mix of mid-century structural and design elements with contemporary finishes and materials layered on. "It's a very sensual home," Mr. Vanderkuip said. "It has such an amazing material to feel ... from cowhide-like wallpaper to granite stone to rough sawn cedar ceilings - you get goosebumps on the arms. You feel you're in the presence of something special."
There are two bedrooms upstairs and two downstairs; the first staircase is right beside the front door. The closet has louvered shutters, straight out of the 1950s, that many guests have suggested Ms. Loomis replace. "People are very free with their opinions," Ms. Loomis said, but wherever possible she kept original features, such as a long rose-wood banquet in the dining room. "It has a complete lack of hardware [there are spring-loaded touch latches]. That's is so au-courant right now, and that's what I love about mid-century modern: It's timeless."
The flooring throughout the main level is all new, Austrian oiled-ash installed in 2012, but straight ahead is the living room with original wood beams that lever up from the centre of the house to an 18-foot granite-faced wall with a fireplace. The window wall on the rear of the house climbs up to meet it, and the wall continues past the window frame connecting exterior to interior (the granite continues, wrapping around the other side of the exterior wall). Hidden inside a concrete fireplace mantel (a Loomis addition) is a television that rises up on a mechanism.
To the right is hallway that connects the old house to the 1970s addition, a principal bedroom with a wall of closets and storage, cow-hide wallpaper, cedar ceiling and a magnificent lava-rock and riverstone fireplace (behind which is a sauna spa and a walkout to an in-ground hot-tub). The master bath has more of that unusual river-bed lava stone for the shower and standalone bath enclosure.
To the left of the foyer is a sitting room, and past that the second main-floor bedroom suite, currently her daughter's room; the bathroom here has also been updated with porcelain-tile walls, penny-tile countertop and a separate bath and shower.
The kitchen is one of the first rooms Ms. Loomis remodelled, blowing out separating walls that chopped up the space and replacing it with a massive 14-foot central island. The sink is in the island, the fridge in the wall behind the sink and the stove is next to a massive new wall of glass added to connect the backyard seating areas to the kitchen. On the opposite wall is a wallmounted wood-burning fireplace surrounded by massive sheets of stainless steel stamped into a crocodile-skin pattern. Next to this is a dine-in area framed by a large window facing onto the streetscape from the corner. Just beyond this is a laundry and pantry area made out of custom cabinets.
It adds up to a lot of textures and materials, but it's also been about experimentation for Ms. Loomis, whose work has moved from purely graphic design to a mix of interior and retail space design work.
"I call myself a dual-discipline designer - I have been doing it freelance up to now, and I would have clients come see my personal space," she said.
The backyard was a huge undertaking by Natural Landscape Group Inc.: two new steel I-beam pergolas (one for lounging, one for the outdoor barbecue kitchen and dining table) with permanent roofs, a wall of frosted glass for privacy along the sideyard and a series of concrete pads separated by stone gardens and Palm Springs-inspired plantings that step down to the inground pool.
A MID-CENTURY TIME CAPSULE There's also a set of stairs here that takes you into the basement, which has been kid-central as her daughter grew up. It's also the space that has the most original interiors, maintaining much of the wood decorative features that made this home such a mid-century marvel.
"I left all the door frames the original oak; I don't want to touch them too much," said Ms. Loomis, who did the most updating in a kitchenette that was originally a wet bar. "I wanted to use it as an in-law suite or it could function as a 2,000-squarefoot separate apartment. I also wanted it to feel like a private space for the kids - you can have 20 kids down there, you don't even see them."
The layout is a bit of a maze down here, but carpet tiles with some Granny Smith green tints act as a way-finder from the back door entrance to the front stairs. Immediately to the left of the rear entrance is an office space in a hallway that leads to the mechanical room. To the right is a TV room with the original cedar cladding on the walls and some newer built-in cabinetry for the media centre. A geothermal furnace was added by Ms. Loomis, necessitating the running of some pipe through this space, but she made a virtue of a new bulkhead by running perimeter lighting behind it, giving this windowless room a generous amount of light.
Ahead through a short hallway is the galley kitchenette on the left, original oak cabinetry but a new cooktop bar with a passthrough to the second basement lounge. Around the corner you walk into perhaps the most spectacular collection of mid-century finishings: a sitting room lined with cedar beams on the ceiling (painted white in between; once a dark cork added even more cloistered darkness) that run toward two walls of exposed brick with firmly rectilinear shapes jutting out to form the fourth wood-burning fireplace, the hearth and a bench next to it.
This room harks the most to the influence of architect Ronald Thom, who Mr. Stewart's company worked with on Shaw Festival buildings.
The final space is a set of rooms that can be closed behind a door just past the front stairway for that in-law suite. One small bedroom, more an office at this scale, and one larger one with a cedar feature wall are joined by a modest-sized bathroom with a large glassed-in shower. There aren't a lot of windows down here, but with everything white except the wood, it's remarkably bright, like a stateroom in a cruise ship more than a basement.
Ms. Loomis wouldn't leave this labour of love behind - she estimates she spent twice the original purchase price over the years on her updates - but with her daughter heading to university, the call of downsizing is getting stronger. She hopes to find some land on the water somewhere in Niagara and build something new for the next phase in her life.
Like Mr. Stewart before her, she's not looking for a price so much as to understand the personality of those interested buyers. "I'm going to feel happier knowing if a buyer understands my desire to hand this house over to someone with the same passion to maintain the integrity of the house," Ms. Loomis said.

Full text: Close to 60 natural gas well sites near the hamlet of Jenner, in southern Alberta, are supposed to have been shut down, cleaned up and the land returned to its natural state. Instead, scattered equipment, holes in the earth, dead vegetation and divots deep enough to swallow the wheel of a pickup truck dot the landscape, evidence of what one regulator called a "really serious case of falsification of documents."
The 59 wells belong to one Calgarybased company. Another, an environmental services provider, applied to the provincial regulator for reclamation certificates that affirmed all the sites had been returned to natural prairie. But after local landowners complained, the Alberta Energy Regulator (AER) launched a two-year investigation and cancelled every certificate.
Aeraden Energy Corp. owns the wells and a company called CEPro Energy & Environmental Services Inc. signed off on the cleanup of the sites.
The AER investigation found that Aeraden had left groundwater monitoring wells, fences and berms on sites, failed to fix slumping soil and dead vegetation, and - in one case - filed for a reclamation certificate for a site that was still active.
The probe included an audit of all reclamation certificate applications lodged by CEPro since 2016. It found the company had submitted site photos that weren't of the wells being reclaimed, and signed off on cleanups at many sites despite holes in the ground and infrastructure left behind.
But neither company will face financial penalties, despite the breadth and seriousness of their contraventions of Alberta's Environmental Protection and Enhancement Act (EPEA) and regulations governing conservation and reclamation. Instead, each company received a warning letter from AER, calling the matter "very serious."
"With additional time and investigation, it is likely that a more significant enforcement action would have been taken by the AER," the letters noted. But a two-year time limit imposed by the EPEA on investigations meant the two companies were simply warned, and notes added to their enforcement histories.
That time limit and the sheer volume of information meant the regulator could only investigate a handful of the 59 sites.
Aeraden was also ordered to complete remediation of the sites. However, the case will have no implications for several other oil and gas sites Aeraden operates across Alberta and Saskatchewan, the AER said.
Matthew Oliver is deputy registrar and chief regulatory officer of the Association of Professional Engineers and Geoscientists of Alberta (APEGA), which regulates the practices of engineering and geoscience in Alberta. It's the largest association of self-regulated professionals in Western Canada, but Mr. Oliver said he has never seen such an egregious case since he was licensed in 1991.
"This is a really, really serious case of falsification of documents" amounting to "more than a casual slip," he told The Globe and Mail.
But the AER said it has no evidence of a deliberate attempt by either company to mislead regulators. It's also standing by OneStop, the online system used for reclamation applications.
The OneStop program removes the requirement for inspectors to even lay their eyes on sites before issuing certificates saying land has been returned to its prewell state. Instead, it relies on energy companies and those that sign off on their cleanup work - agrologists and engineers, for example - to attest the information attached to their applications is true and correct.
Legislation that governs APEGA prevents Mr. Oliver from confirming whether an investigation into CEPro and its president, Lian Zhao, is under way, but he said "this is exactly the sort of case that would result in a complaint being filed with [APEGA's] investigative committee."
Ms. Zhao did not want to answer questions or provide information about the case when reached by The Globe by phone, saying only it was a "complex story."
The AER says neither CEPro nor Aeraden have appealed the warning letters, and Ms. Zhao would not confirm whether her company plans to take that route.
Aeradan doesn't list any employees on its website, but its office manager, Wendy Ma - who is named in the AER penalty letter - did not return repeated phone calls and e-mails asking for comment. Nor did the company's owner, Vancouver-based Saliance Global Holdings Co. Ltd.
According to Saliance's website, it owns Aldesta Hotels Group, which runs a range of luxury hotels and resorts in British Columbia and Australia. It's also an affiliate of Shanghai SanDun Auto Parts Co. Ltd. - which supplies auto parts for various companies out of its manufacturing facilities in Shanghai - and an Australian property development and management company called G&Q Real Estate.
Aeraden first came to the attention of Kris Bower, co-founder of an advisory firm called Welltraxx, about four years ago when Aeraden bought a collection of natural gas wells from Magnum Energy Inc. Welltraxx helps landowners across Western Canada manage their oil and gas holdings, and is assisting a group in Jenner.
For years, Aeraden has failed to pay those local farmers and ranchers the money they're contracted to receive for the leases on their land, Mr. Bower told The Globe. He has worked on the land agent side of oil and gas for close to 20 years, but said the AeradenCEPro case was "certainly an oddball" owing to the sheer volume of breaches.
"Most of those sites were not anywhere close to being [reclamation certificate] ready," he said. "There was still much work needed, but just how that got so far off the rails, well, I'm not really sure."
Mr. Bower said landowners started raising red flags when they received reclamation certificate packages in the mail that indicated they had signed off on cleanup work. They hadn't.
Mr. Oliver of APEGA, the engineering association, says it goes "right to the core of who we are are professionals" if and when members flout the rules that govern them.
"One count of falsifying a document is immensely serious.
[The AER] felt there were grounds there to cancel 59 reclamation certificates, which is huge," he said.
"We know times are tough in the industry right now, but that moves me to say we need to be focused even more on people not cutting corners and not falsifying things, because the protection of the public is even more critical."

Full text: Canada has granted asylum to 14 Hong Kong pro-democracy activists fleeing Beijing's crackdown in the former British colony, according to a Canadian group supporting dozens of refugee claimants.
Jane Lee is co-founder of New Hong Kong Cultural Club, a group of Canadian supporters of democracy in Hong Kong that has branches in Toronto, Calgary and Vancouver. She said her group has assisted 30 Hong Kongers in applying for asylum in Canada, and of these, all have been recognized as claimants. Of this group, 14 have been accepted as political refugees.
These developments are a sign Canada is opening its doors to those targeted by the Chinese government.
Immigration Minister Marco Mendicino's office declined to comment on refugee applications, saying decisions on those are made by an independent board, but said Canada intends to welcome Hong Kongers where possible.
"The ties that bind Canada and Hong Kong run deep, [and] with many young Hong Kongers casting their eyes abroad, we want them to choose Canada," Alexander Cohen, press secretary for Mr. Mendicino, said in a statement.
"We strongly support the right to peaceful protest, freedom of expression and freedom of assembly, and taking part in these is never an offence under Canadian law."
As Vancouver immigration lawyer Richard Kurland points out, however, accepting refugees from Hong Kong is also an indictment of the Asian city's justice system, which still retains the legacy of institutional frameworks from Britain, despite Hong Kong's 1997 handover to China.
He said the sweeping new security law imposed on Hong Kong last June by Beijing has made it easier to obtain refugee status in Canada. This law was ostensibly to target secession, subversion and terrorism, but it contains vaguely defined offences that critics say effectively criminalize dissent and opposition.
"By implication, the Canadian refugee determination system has put the Hong Kong judicial system into disrepute."
The Globe and Mail has spoken to some of the refugees, but it's withholding reporting certain details of their cases because they fear retribution against themselves or families back in Hong Kong by agents of the Chinese Communist Party. The Globe is also granting them confidentiality for the same reason.
Under Canadian law, a "convention refugee" refers to the United Nations convention relating to the status of refugees and is defined as someone who cannot return to their home "due to a well-founded fear of persecution based on race, religion, political opinion" or other factors.
Peter (a pseudonym), a Hong Konger in his 30s, is one of the 14 applicants who has gained asylum in Canada. The Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada informed him in a letter dated Dec. 1 that the refugee protection division has determined he is a "convention refugee" and his claim for asylum was accepted.
Peter has settled in an Ontario city and enrolled in information technology studies to help restart his career. His activist career dates back as far as the 2014 Umbrella Movement protests in Hong Kong after Beijing rejected the idea of open elections and said it would control the nomination of candidates for the election of Hong Kong's chief executive.
He said he was not arrested or charged for protesting, but was under surveillance and felt it was unsafe for him to remain in Hong Kong.
Peter said he sorely misses his family and expects his only means of visiting them in the future will be to meet somewhere such as Taiwan.
Peter said he's aware of many Hong Kong activists who would like to apply for asylum in Canada, but cannot because pandemic travel restrictions prevent them from reaching Canadian soil to make a claim.
Western countries including Canada, Australia, Britain and the United States have accused China's one-party state of breaking a 1984 treaty in which Beijing pledged to maintain Hong Kong's local autonomy, civil rights and rule of law for 50 years after the handover. Since June, 2020, authorities in Hong Kong, backed by Beijing, have barred pro-democracy legislators from running for office, and this month police conducted sweeping arrests of most of the remaining opposition figures and activists.
Mr. Kurland said he believes China's strategy is not to bring dissident Hong Kongers to heel, but instead encourage an exodus of those who disagree with rule by the Chinese Communist Party, leaving the city and its wealthy real estate as a haven for Chinese elite. "They want to keep the water on boil but not overflowing the pot - executing public arrest warrants to motivate people to leave. If they can chase away 50,000 to 60,000 young people a year to other countries, it's low-cost for them."
There are an estimated 300,000 Canadian citizens living in Hong Kong, but their future there is not certain.
The Vancouver lawyer said he believes China will at some point move to force foreign passport holders to choose between their Hong Kong residency permit and citizenship abroad.
Regina Ip, a pro-Beijing lawmaker in Hong Kong, wrote a column in the South China Morning Post last Sunday saying Hong Kongers should be required to make a choice between the right of abode in Hong Kong or foreign citizenship.
She said Beijing has long adopted a "one eye open, one eye closed" approach to Hong Kongers with dual nationality, but argued this should change.
"Twenty-three years after the handover, those who make a conscious decision to leave and, by implication, give up on Hong Kong, should be asked to make a choice - China or a foreign country," she wrote.

Full text: The B.C. government says its land-matching program, linking farmers to landowners, has reached a milestone with more than 100 connections.
It says farmers in the province have used the program to grow crops and raise livestock on about 2,000 hectares over the past four years.
The government says 46 land matches were finalized last year, which will bring more local food options to communities.
Agriculture Minister Lana Popham said in a statement the program helps farmers access land, keeping it in production, while adding a next generation of agriculture leaders.
Ninety per cent of the matches are in regions with high real estate prices, including Metro Vancouver, the Fraser Valley, Vancouver Island and the Okanagan.
The businesses farm a range of agricultural products such as sheep, flowers, berries, eggs, honey, mushrooms and more.

Full text: There was a time when taxis, pizza delivery drivers and even the police refused to cross the boundary of Membertou First Nation.
The urban Mi'kmaq reservation, on the southern edge of Sydney, N.S., used to be the kind of place many in Cape Breton avoided. It was seen by outsiders, unfairly, as rough, poor and unwelcoming to business. Chief Terry Paul, a residential-school survivor who grew up here in a home without running water, knew it differently. It was his home. And he imagined a better future.
Today, if you want a pizza, or a Vietnamese banh mi, or even sea scallop risotto, you don't have to leave the reserve.
Taxis line up outside the Membertou Trade and Convention Centre and bring a steady stream of visitors to the community's hotel, casino, health and wellness centre, bowling alley, gaming centre, geothermal-heated arena and dozen other businesses.
The Cape Breton Regional Police are here, too, with a detachment stationed in the community.
"When I was growing up, there were absolutely no stores here at all. Everything we got was off the reserve. ... It was so bad here, even the police had a hard time coming up here," said Mr. Paul, who has led Membertou since 1984.
"They all used to avoid this place. Now, they're all here. They have businesses here.
"Even the taxis wait for their fares."
This month, the remarkable four-decade-long transformation of the community reached a new milestone with Membertou's coownership of the largest shellfish producer in North America, Clearwater Seafoods.
Mr. Paul orchestrated the $1-billion deal to buy the Halifax-based company on behalf of seven Mi'kmaq First Nations along with Premium Brands Holdings Corp., a specialty food company based in B.C.
The purchase, in quiet development for years, places Membertou and the other Mi'kmaq communities on new footing in the Atlantic Canadian seafood industry.
The First Nations coalition, which invested $250-million, will control Clearwater's coveted offshore fishing licences and get access to jobs and other opportunities that would have been unimaginable a generation ago.
The blockbuster deal, celebrated as the largest investment in the seafood industry by any Indigenous group in Canada, comes at a critical moment for First Nations communities in the region with tensions still high over Mi'kmaq treaty-based fishing rights.
The agreement is part of a generational shift in the way Indigenous communities create economic opportunities for their people.
Significant business deals involving First Nations in Canada - from Squamish Nation's 6,000unit residential development in Vancouver to Henvey Inlet First Nation's $1-billion wind farm project in Ontario - show Indigenous leaders are looking to new, longterm revenue sources for their communities.
In Membertou, it's no different.
"It's one of those things that changes the entire conversation in the country, forever. It changes the way non-Indigenous people see Indigenous folks in a very positive way," said Ken Coates, a senior fellow in Indigenous rights and economic development with Ottawa's MacDonald Laurier Institute for Public Policy.
"Membertou has said, ‘We'll do this ourselves. We'll create our own opportunities, our own jobs, our own prosperity.' But you have to look at these deals collectively, because it's well beyond Membertou. ... I think First Nations have realized the path to equity and prosperity comes from buying back Canada."
Mr. Paul, a gregarious, grandfatherly figure who was recently reelected for a ninth term, can't walk through Membertou without people wanting to shake his hand and talk. And no wonder.
Many in this community of approximately1,700 in northeastern Cape Breton credit him with turning the place into a bustling economic hub.
And while Mr. Paul has dreams that a Mi'kmaq CEO may one day sit in the executive suite at Clearwater, his vision for a new Membertou First Nation is already well under way. Between the band operations and more than a dozen community-owned commercial enterprises ranging from the fisheries, hospitality, tourism and casinos, Membertou employs more than 600 people - making it one of the largest employers in the Cape Breton Regional Municipality. It's also one of the largest property tax payers in the area, and has doubled its land base since the 1980s.
The band, through its corporate division, is one of the most important developers in Cape Breton, using gaming revenues and First Nations financing programs to fund new commercial real estate projects that lure medical and financial services tenants to the community. One of its most ambitious projects is Churchill Crossing, a sprawling shopping and commercial district still in development near the Cape Breton Regional Hospital.
As recently as the 1980s, Membertou was a very different place.
People from Sydney didn't enter the reserve, and its Mi'kmaq residents rarely left, life-long residents say. Even though the reserve is within city limits, there was an imaginary line that divided the two communities.
"That was taught in the homes.
We were taught you don't go into town, and they were taught you didn't go up to Membertou," said Graham Marshall, 42, a councillor with the First Nation.
"I remember being young and seeing non-Indigenous people walking on Membertou Street. We were all looking at them, like ‘What are they doing? They're crazy.' " The racism and mistrust was instilled in people over generations. Mr. Marshall's cousin is Donald Marshall Jr., the Indigenous fishing rights pioneer who spent11 years in prison for a murder he didn't commit in the 1970s. His wrongful conviction exposed, in plain terms, the bias against Mi'kmaq people that existed within the Sydney police and local court system.
Today, Graham Marshall's teenaged son is best friends with a white kid from town - something he says wouldn't have happened when he was a child. As economic lines have blurred between Membertou and Sydney, so have the long-standing social barriers.
"It just warms my heart. I have this little white boy coming over to my house and he's like part of the family," he said. "That's the progression that we've made."
The Clearwater deal is the latest step forward, he said, and sends a signal to Mi'kmaq that anything is possible. Suddenly, the people of Membertou have a major ownership stake in the seafood sector, changing the whole dynamic in the industry.
"Back in the day, our parents would say, ‘The sky's the limit, and you can do whatever you want.' But being Indigenous, you also knew you could only go so far," Mr. Marshall said. "Today, we can actually tell our kids the sky is the limit, and there's no more barriers. There's no more ceiling."
Mr. Paul was just a five-year-old boy when he was sent to the Shubenacadie Indian Residential School, a notorious Nova Scotia institution where children were subjected to physical and sexual abuse, poor living conditions, forced farm labour and punished for speaking the Mi'kmaq language.
The experience shaped the rest of his life, but it's not something the 68-year-old Chief likes to talk about very much.
"I know when I try to look back to that time, it just opens up really hurtful and emotional memories," he told the Cape Breton Post in 2008. "I just remember the little child, the five year-old there, and it's me. That child in that memory will never grow up."
The community he returned to after the residential school was racked by unemployment and poor management, with dirt roads and crumbling government houses. Its residents feared the police, had few job or educational opportunities and understood their place in Nova Scotia society.
"The only time the police came up here was to arrest somebody," he said. "We all knew that. I was taught that we always had to run from them. I once asked, ‘Why are we running?' " In the early 1970s, he left Membertou to work for the North American Indian Center of Boston, a non-profit that provides health, job and other social services to Indigenous people. He learned critical administrative and financial management skills and became the group's director of finance while still in his mid-20s.
He was eventually promoted to the organization's president before returning home to Membertou. He became the band's economic development officer in 1981, and then its chief by the age of 30, beginning an uninterrupted political run that has brought stability to the band council for more than 37 years.
As chief, he took over the First Nation with an $8-million budget - and a $1-million annual deficit - with poor accounting to show where money was being spent. He was determined to defy stereotypes about poor, mismanaged reserves.
"I said, ‘We need to get away from operating this way,' " he said. "The most important thing in any organization, I feel, is its management, its administration." Last year, Membertou reported revenue of $67-million, including money from its fisheries division, property rentals and commercial sales. More than $19-million came from federal government transfers - something the Chief says he hopes can eventually be reduced to zero. He's among a growing number of First Nations leaders who are trying to get away from a reliance on government funds, Dr.
Coates said.
"I'd like to be financially independent from the government, and I'd like our people to be able to look after ourselves. The best example of that would be when we get offered that government cheque, and we can say, ‘We don't need it. Give it to another community that really needs it,' " Mr. Paul said.
To change the community, the Chief and council started restructuring the band's administration, adopting the principles of efficiency and openness from the corporate world. Membertou became transparent with its finances, and aggressively pro-business, seeking opportunities wherever they appeared. It publishes its financial statements on its website so anyone can see where and how the band spends money.
Mr. Marshall describes the era before Mr. Paul as "like a lost time for our people." The community was staggered by chronic deficits, overwhelming poverty, substandard housing. The then-young chief began the transformation by altering the way his people approached those fundamental challenges.
"He always envisioned Membertou at its greatest potential, to show that we can do it, and we are capable of doing it on our own," Mr. Marshall said. "We've never liked the word ‘can't,' because we've heard it all our lives. Instead of just pointing out problems, we're looking for solutions. He's been spearheading that for decades."
Improving education has been a big part of the band's success.
When Mr. Paul took over in the 1980s, high-school graduation rates in the community were about 30 per cent. Today, they're more than 90 per cent.
Mr. Marshall, who quit school in Grade 10, went to night school as an adult to complete his diploma. The former truck driver says his graduation from Cape Breton University in 2019 was one of his proudest moments. He was the first Mi'kmaq person to sit on the university's alumni board of directors.
Education is a priority for many families here, but so is being community-minded. As much as Mr. Paul promotes financial sustainability, he and his council also promote programs to help families and preserve the Mi'kmaq culture and language.
"I've always told my kids they can be whatever they want to be when they grow up, whether it's a doctor or an engineer. But they need to contribute to their people, too," said Mr. Marshall, a father of four whose eldest daughter is now studying engineering at CBU.
"They need to leave something behind."
As it pursued business partnerships, the band created a separate corporate division with an office on Halifax's waterfront. It received coveted International Organization of Standards (ISO) status - becoming the first Indigenous government in Canada to be ISO 9001 certified, establishing its credibility in the business world.
To address the housing problem, the band established its own mortgage lending agency, allowing community members to finance renovations and home construction, while building equity. Today, the community is flanked by rows of modern, new bungalows. Under Mr. Paul, the band also reformed its hiring practices. He began filling Membertou's payroll with the best people he could find, people with MBAs, commerce backgrounds and law degrees. He didn't care if they were Indigenous or not.
About half of the band's 600 employees are Mi'kmaq.
One of the most symbolic developments in Membertou's evolution didn't happen on the reserve at all. It came in 2015 when the band bought the Sydney Medical Arts office building on nearby Kings Road, and became the landlord to a group of tenants including a pharmacy, medical professionals, a hearing loss clinic and plastic surgery clinic.
A century ago, that building's land was part of the Kings Road Reserve, the predecessor to Membertou. That historical Mi'kmaq community on the edge of the Sydney Harbour was deemed inconvenient by the city's planners at the time, and relocated by the federal government to its presentday landlocked location farther up the hill.
The purchase - which once again gave the community access to the water, something it once had for centuries - sent a message to many Sydney residents about how much Membertou's status had changed. Still, the community's expansion, particularly land acquisition for development, is sometimes met with opposition, the Chief said.
"We have a lot of people who are suspicious of what we're up to.
It's always people who aren't from the reserve," Mr. Paul said. "We try to buy land, and people say, ‘Yeah, but you don't have to pay tax.' We do pay tax, lots of it. And we don't have a problem paying that. It comes from revenues we made ourselves."
The foundation for the Clearwater deal was laid more than two decades ago when Donald Marshall Jr.
took his fight over Indigenous fishing rights all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada, Dr. Coates said. The landmark Marshall Decision gave the Mi'kmaq the right to hunt and fish for a moderate livelihood. That, along with federal financing for new Indigenous fisheries, created thousands of jobs and a path for Indigenous people to create their own companies.
That access to the commercial fishery allowed them to begin building partnerships in the business world, he said.
"Twenty years ago, the goal was participation in the economy.
They just wanted jobs," he said.
"Then it became ‘Can we get involved in business?' They got into the work force and business community in a very substantial way, and now they're getting into equity."
The Clearwater sale is the latest in a series of transactions between Mr. Paul and Clearwater, which was started out of the back of a pickup truck in 1976 by John Risley and Colin MacDonald. Today, the company is the largest holder of shellfish licences and quotas in Canada, fishing for scallops, lobster, clam, shrimp, langoustine, whelk, crab, and groundfish. It sold $616-million worth of seafood last year.
In March, 2019, Clearwater partnered with 14 First Nation communities, including Membertou, on the surf clam harvest, and agreed to send millions of dollars in benefits to those communities through revenue-sharing agreements. In September, the company agreed to sell two of its eight offshore lobster licences to the Membertou First Nation for $25million. Two months later, Clearwater confirmed it was being sold to the Mi'kmaq First Nations coalition, led by the Membertou First Nation, and Premium holdings, which will each acquire half ownership of the company. The deal, recently approved by Clearwater shareholders and expected to close later this month, is as much about good business as it is advancing "reconciliation in Canada," Mr. MacDonald said.
With Clearwater, the Mi'kmaq will have every opportunity to get jobs, training and be promoted throughout the company, Mr. Paul said. "I've always said I want to hire the smartest people I can. I don't care where they're from," he said. "With Clearwater, the opportunities for our community members will be from the deckhand all the way up to the CEO's office. As long as they're qualified, they can do that. And we can help get them there."
It's not surprising a company like Clearwater would want to sell to the Mi'kmaq, Dr. Coates said.
Indigenous business is one of the fastest-growing areas of the Canadian economy. First Nations enterprises tend to reinvest locally, keep revenue in their communities and yet think globally, he said.
"They're all long-term revenue producers. These are carefully calculated, long-term equity deals that will return very substantial amounts of revenue back to their communities," Dr. Coates said.
Membertou's people have long looked to the water to provide for their community. The band's fisheries department now employs about 50 people, most of them in the inshore snow crab and lobster fishery around Cape Breton.
The community is also pursuing its own moderate livelihood fishery, a right affirmed by Donald Marshall Jr.'s Supreme Court fight.
Mi'kmaq communities are seeking changes in federal and provincial regulation that would allow them to sell lobster caught under the Indigenous fishery, solving a problem for Mi'kmaq fishermen who say they're being boycotted by most of the region's seafood buyers.
If that happens, the Clearwater sale changes the power dynamics in the Atlantic fishery even further. For now, seafood buyers can only buy lobster from federally licensed harvesters, not bands producing their own licences under the Marshall Decision.
"It's still sinking in, what we've been able to accomplish," Mr. Paul said. "We haven't made any decisions yet around the moderate livelihood fishery. We're still maintaining that this is a commercial transaction. It's a Canadian business that has international reach, and we feel we're in a really good position as a major player in the Atlantic fishery."
The Clearwater deal clearly opens doors for Mi'kmaq well beyond the boundaries of their communities, the Chief said, allowing them to look at the seafood industry without limitations. The company has operations in China, Britain and around Atlantic Canada, and is focused on growth outside of Canada.
A few years ago, the idea that a group of Mi'kmaq communities could have that kind of global reach in the seafood business might have been hard to imagine. Mr. Paul thought differently. "I'd like to take a map of the world, and look at where the opportunities are," he said. "That's what good management does. The opportunities are worldwide."

Full text: Back when photography was expensive, architects or building owners rarely documented every little detail. Therefore, even the folks responsible for the care and maintenance of Canada's great buildings, such as Toronto's Union Station, can be forgiven for not providing future generations with full photographic records of its myriad parts.
This, of course, makes the task of recreating lost details all the more challenging. Take the exterior lighting at Union Station, for example: While it's impossible to pinpoint exactly when the original 1920s fixtures were removed - I have squinted at 1970s-era postcards and thought I'd spotted them, but then, in another, they appear to be gone - it's likely they were gone by the 1980s, and for the simple reason that decades of acid rain had finally corroded the cast-iron beauties beyond repair.
It's too bad those 1970s employees didn't warehouse the remaining rusty bits should anyone in the 2010s want to push a measuring tape against them.
"Well, absolutely," industrial/ lighting designer John Garrett of Lighting Nelson & Garrett Inc., says with a laugh at the thought. "I just can't believe that they would've disappeared off the face of the earth - maybe they're in somebody's garden somewhere."
However, you won't hear exasperation in the voice of the 66year-old Niagara Falls resident: "It gets me more motivated," he says of the Union Station project, which wraps this month, lightingwise, when the last two fixtures are mounted.
"It's really cool to be able to work on stuff like that."
And you won't see a furrowed brow on his partner, Christopher Nelson, who cut his teeth at age five in his father's Port Colborne, Ont., lighting shop.
"I really get a charge out of this stuff," the 64-year-old says, thinking back to 1997, when Herbert Nelson helped the duo restore the lanterns at College Park (the lanterns were designed by Herbert's father, Samuel, in the 1920s). "I do feel like we ... serve a purpose in keeping the history of the city alive."
But when that history is quite dead, what to do? Thankfully, the word from the City of Toronto, project leader NORR and others associated with the Union Station Revitalization Project, was "do what you must."
So, the men first gathered up what documentation they could, some from local archives and some from the Canadian Centre for Architecture in Montreal (since Montreal firm Ross and Macdonald were involved in the creation of the Beaux-Arts building along with Toronto's John M.
Lyle).
For the two massive hanging lanterns at each portico, a lone architectural drawing existed; for the pairs of wall-mounted lanterns at the east and west doorways (one labelled "Postal Station A," the other "Railway Offices"), the duo found one very good photograph titled Detail of Post Office Entrance; for the nine post fixtures to be placed along the ramp, there was, again, one good photograph, Detail of Ramp Rail and three good 1919 blueprints to study ... however, for the bas-relief on each post's lighting box, the sketch of a winged creature and some sort of rose was incomplete, with only the frustrating note "See Model" written over top. And of course that model was long gone.
"I couldn't figure out what this flying thing was, this flying lioness, I'd never heard of it before ... so I started Googling winged griffins and winged lions and came up with a lot of information," Mr. Garrett says. The rose was determined to be a Tudor rose when Mr. Garrett brought his sketches to the wood carver, Barry Casement in Welland, Ont., to have the panel created in three dimensions.
The intricate pieces that would hold up that winged lioness and Tudor rose - and all of the pieces that would create the other fixtures - had to be drawn up as well before they could go to the pattern maker, but it wasn't easy.
"None of the details [on the original drawings] were worked out; there was no information on how these things should go together, it was just what the architect had in mind for them to look like, proportionally," Mr. Garrett says.
"You could see ghost-images and his stages of thought ... we had to re-engineer the things."
After countless hours poring over enlarged drawings, magnifying glasses in hand and site visits to determine scale - the size of the limestone blocks helped, as did discoloured limestone where original mounting hardware had sat, and, surprisingly, the blacksmith-forged chains for the hanging lanterns remained attached to the building - new and intricate architectural drawings were created. These were then taken to pattern maker Simon Schofield in St. George, Ont.
"It was amazing to meet someone with that much knowledge of how things were done at the turn of the [previous] century," Mr. Garrett says.
Mr. Schofield even taught the foundry a few tricks on how to use leather during the sand-casting process.
Before creating the 15 fixtures, however, Nelson & Garrett suggested to the architects and heritage consultants that aluminum be used instead of iron. "And everybody's jaw just dropped," Mr. Garrett remembers with a laugh.
When asked to explain why, Mr. Garrett said: "If they'd been made out of aluminum to begin with, they would've still been standing, they wouldn't have rotted." As an added advantage, the weight would be but a fraction of the originals.
At Nelson & Garrett's big shop in south Etobicoke, Mr. Nelson hands your humble Architourist a few of the cast aluminum pieces to demonstrate. They look a lot heavier than they are. A few paces to my left, the pattern maker's pieces are laid out, including Mr. Casement's carved panel; some come apart like a 3-D jigsaw puzzle any architectural aficionado would love to play with.
Mr. Nelson now shows me the modern guts that will inhabit the wall lantern's interior, but points out that individual, round LED bulbs will mimic the glow of original incandescents.
"Now you might say, ‘Why would you do all this when you can just put a big LED tube in here and let it glow?' " he says. "Well, I sort of insisted on it ... I've had to fight with electrical engineers on heritage jobs."
A challenging job, yes, and perhaps a few fights, but Nelson & Garrett wouldn't have it any other way. "We feel lucky, we've gotten to work on so many fantastic buildings, new and old," Mr. Nelson says.

Full text: Sales of homes worth more than $3-million hit a record in the Toronto region last year, with purchases more than doubling in the suburbs as buyers sought bigger spaces during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Overall in the Greater Toronto Area, there were 1,068 luxury house and condo sales, a 56-percent increase over 2019, according to a new report from Re/Max.
The demand for more room and green space drove sales of low-rise properties at all price points across the country as remote work became a necessity for office workers. That trend was also strong among affluent homebuyers.
"People were looking at their living arrangements and they found out very quickly if it was working for them or not," said Christopher Alexander, executive vice-president with Re/Max.
"It is different if you leave every day to go to work. When you are at home every single day, you notice these things," he said.
In the city of Toronto, luxury home sales rose 30 per cent, year over year, to 652 transactions, according to Re/Max. The highest number of luxury home sales were in the wealthy northern part of the city - the Bridle Path, Sunnybrook and Hoggs Hollow areas - as well as just west in the Bedford Park, Lawrence Park and Forest Hill neighbourhoods.
In the Toronto suburbs, also called the 905 for their area code, sales of expensive houses jumped 112 per cent to 416 transactions. The highest number of $3million-plus sales were just west of the city of Toronto in Mississauga and Oakville, as well as just north of the city in Richmond Hill.
Luxury home sales slowed in 2018 and 2019 after the foreign buyers' real estate tax was imposed in an attempt to curb speculation. With the pandemic slowing immigration and travel to Canada, the numbers suggest that domestic buyers were responsible for the increase in luxury home sales.
Mr. Alexander said domestic buyers offset a decline in purchases by international buyers.
The record number of luxury home sales is reflected in the higher average selling price across all types of properties in the Toronto region. Last year, it hit a record $929,699, according to the local real estate board.

Full text: Housing markets in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal jumped in December, capping a hectic year that saw sales rebound from a temporary pandemic-induced slump.
Record-low mortgage rates and the work-from-home trend had buyers looking for bigger properties, driving demand toward houses and away from downtown condos.
House sales and prices spiked in the three big urban centres as well as their suburbs and nearby vacation locations, as office workers were forced to work from home.
The competition for townhomes and houses with green space inflated property values, with the Toronto region's average selling price rising to a record high of $929,699.
Meanwhile, the condo market in downtown Toronto and Montreal showed signs of softening amid the slowdown in immigration and flood of units for sale.
"The condo market has been hurt by COVID crisis, especially properties without any balcony or terrace," said Charles Brant, director of market analysis for the Quebec Professional Association of Real Estate Brokers. "A lot of people are leaving downtown for the surrounding areas," he said.
The volume of sales in properties in the areas surrounding the island of Montreal and houses in the city drove transactions in the Montreal census metropolitan area to 55,609 last year, 8 per cent higher than 2019.
In the Toronto region, the largest residential market in the country, 95,151 homes sold last year. That was 8 per cent higher than in 2019 and the third-highest level on record, according to the local real estate board.
In the Vancouver area, there were 30,944 transactions last year, according to the region's board.
That was a 22-per-cent increase over 2019, when buyers were adapting to a higher foreignbuyers tax and stricter mortgage rules.
After home sales stalled in April because of pandemic restrictions, competition for lowrise properties soared and sent overall sales to record highs in major markets in the ensuing months. The surge in buying continued into the fall and the traditionally slow winter months.
Last month, Montreal had record sales, with robust activity in periphery markets such as SaintJean-sur-Richelieu and the North Shore, according to Quebec's real estate group.
Toronto also had record sales in December, according to Toronto Regional Real Estate Board, and in Vancouver, last month's sales were nearly 60 per cent higher than the 10-year average.
Economists and realtors have said a shortage of houses for sale has contributed to the jump in prices; with the common fiveyear fixed mortgage below 2 per cent, that has made it easier for home buyers to handle a bigger loan.
"When money is cheaper, you are going to have more sales. And if your inventory is constrained, which it certainly has been, that is going to put upward pressure on prices," said Colette Gerber, chair of the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver.
In the Vancouver region, the home price index across all types of properties hit $1,047,400 in December, up incrementally from November but an increase of 5.4 per cent over December of 2019.
The index is often used in industry instead of average prices, as it corrects for expensive transactions. In vacation locations such as B.C.'s Sunshine Coast and Bowen Island, it was up 22 per cent and 28 per cent, respectively.
In the Toronto area, the average selling price reached $932,222 in December, an increase of 11 per cent over the same month in 2019.
The value of detached houses rose the most in the suburbs, up 23 per cent to $1,175,753. Only condos in the city of Toronto lost value last year, with the average selling price falling 5 per cent to $625,828 in the 12 months to December.
Condo listings in the cities of Toronto and Montreal have skyrocketed. In Toronto, they are up 171 per cent over December, 2019.
"Growth in condo listings far outstripped growth in sales. Increased choice for condo buyers ultimately led to more bargaining power and a year-over-year dip in average condo selling prices during the last few months of the year," Jason Mercer, the board's chief market analyst, said in a news release.
On the Island of Montreal, active condo listings were up by 69 per cent compared with December, 2019. In contrast, active listings of houses were down 44 per cent across the Montreal region and down 17 per cent in the city.
The median price for houses across the Montreal area climbed 21 per cent to $430,000 in the 12 months to December, and was up 14 per cent to $325,000 for condos.
Mr. Brant, with Quebec realtors, expects condo prices to fall between 1 per cent and 10 per cent in the first quarter of this year. Unlike Montreal, Ms. Gerber does not expect Vancouver's condo market to weaken and said demand from buyers who cannot afford a house would sustain it.

Full text: While many church congregations are shrinking or struggling financially, Weston Park Baptist Church is placing its faith in development plans that aim to revitalize its property in the west-end Toronto neighbourhood.
"Our vision formulated [in] 2005," church deacon John Frogley-Rawson says. "It's a nice piece of land, and we have developed [a plan] for the property and the community."
The church has been located on a 1.1-acre (0.4-hectare) site in the Weston Road and Lawrence Avenue West area since 1907 and has occupied its current building since the late 1940s.
The congregation, the City of Toronto and the developer-partner will be meeting throughout 2021 to refine the vision. In March, they will be submitting an application to the city for rezoning, Mr. Frogley-Rawson says.
The church, which has a following of about 175 people, is working with Maple, Ont.-based developer Castlepoint Investments Inc. (Castlepoint Numa), to build a new church, likely elsewhere on the site, while retaining the existing sanctuary for other new uses, such as live performances.
The plan is to redevelop the rest of the site for community, retail and recreational use, with some mixed housing. The congregation is also eager to make sure there is space to continue running the Weston Area Emergency Support food bank, which was established 30 years ago and has been housed in the church for 25.
"The church sees an opportunity to replace its worship space and at the same time bring in revenues from renting space and also making the whole site open and available to community groups," says Derek Ballantyne, chief executive of Encasa Financial Inc. Mr. Ballantyne spearheaded the redevelopment of Toronto's Regent Park neighbourhood and has served as a consultant for the Weston project.
The church and developer are currently consulting on design ideas with nearby residents, businesses and the city, aiming for approval in 2022. They're working with two Toronto architects: Drew Sinclair, founding partner and managing director of SvN Architects and Planners, and Ralph Giannone of Giannone Petricone Associates Inc.
Once designs are settled, the plan is to be finished building within five years.
The ultimate goal is to keep the Baptist church a centrepiece in the development, while updating a property that has been at the centre of many changes in Weston Village. This project, expected to cost between $25-million and $30-million, is unusual in that it's enhancing a religious building rather than getting rid of one.
In other cases, changing use for church property is typically driven by shrinking religious affiliation; in 2011, nearly a quarter of Canadians said they follow "no religion." In 2019, the National Trust for Canada estimated that 9,000 church buildings across the country will be converted or redeveloped for other uses by the end of this decade.
Across Canada and other countries, religious institutions are looking either to monetize properties, often centrally located, or to put them to use in new ways that are relevant in the 21st century.
The Maison de la littérature, for example, is a former Methodist church in Quebec City's Old City that was converted in 2015.
It houses a public library, a permanent exhibition on Quebec literature, studios, workshops and space for a writer-in-residence.
Other church buildings have met different fates. In Maastricht, the Netherlands, a 13thcentury Dominican church has become a spectacular bookstore, while Toronto's venerable 1913 Deer Park United Church, at St.
Clair Avenue West and Avenue Road, has been mostly torn down to give way for a glass and steel condo tower.
"Every church is a bit different when it comes to converting uses," says Mr. Sinclair, who has worked with different religious institutions on projects before Weston Park.
"The majority of church conversions happen for practical reasons. In a lot of cases, the congregation has shrunk or moved, but the symbology and the architecture are still rich," Mr. Sinclair says. He points to another example in Winnipeg's Osborne Village, where the Augustine United Church, a 117-year-old heritage property, is being converted into a community hub in a $6.5million project that will still house the congregation of about 90 people.
"The process for redeveloping is different for each of the national churches," Mr. Sinclair adds.
Decisions for diocese-based religious groups, such as Roman Catholics and Anglicans, are made by central church authorities. The United Church of Canada has its own in-house real estate corporation to manage its congregations' redevelopment projects.
"For many other churches and religious groups, the only real choice is for individual congregations to manage their own projects," Mr. Sinclair says.
Weston Park Baptist is an independent congregational church with a board of directors.
"It's self-determining, so we can make decisions," Mr. FrogleyRawson says. "Everyone in the congregation has input and we vote."
The congregation and the developer view the project as an opportunity to enhance the neighbourhood.
"I have fond memories of the neighbourhood," Castlepoint president Alfredo Romano says.
"I used to play hockey at the Weston Lions Arena and go to the Weston Cinema, which was down the street."
While the arena is still there, the movie theatre is gone. The neighbourhood was also once anchored by a busy bicycle factory - if you rode a CCM up to the 1960s, it may have come from there. There were also local stores that have since vanished.
"The neighbourhood declined commercially, but now it has another kind of character." Mr. Romano says. "It's youthful and has a lot of spirit."
The site is next to a station that services GO Transit commuter trains, as well as the UP Express line between Union Station and Pearson International Airport. Metrolinx, the regional transportation agency, currently leases part of the site for parking.
"Having the station there is a game-changer for the neighbourhood," Mr. Romano says. "You can get to and from downtown in 15 minutes by train with just one stop [at Dundas West TTC station]."
While the final designs are still being considered, the developers and the community would like the site to have less parking and become a community hub with meeting rooms, performance areas, stores and pedestrian walks.
"We all agree that we want the ground floor to be very public and open, and that we don't want the building to turn its back to the street or the neighbourhood," says Elsa Fancello, vice-president of planning and development for Castlepoint.
Making churches accessible to the community may sound like a new idea, but it has been going on for quite a while, Mr. Romano adds.
"They've been the community centres of their day since at least the year 1000, maybe longer," he says. "In our secular society that has changed, but a lot of [their] purpose remains."

Campaign to save a mighty old oak succeeds

Full text: The pictures don't do it justice. Its breadth defies twodimensionality. What seems like another big oak in photos is, in person, so lavish in proportion that it has been known to elicit uncontrollable laughs, buckling knees and incredulity among first-time visitors.
"It's real - isn't it?" said one city councillor's assistant upon seeing the tree up close a few years back.
"This is not a fake?" One veteran arborist named Stephen Smith was moved to proclaim, "I would chain myself to this tree. ... This is the perfect tree."
But the reaction that mattered most came 15 years ago when Edith George, a long-time resident in the northwest Toronto neighbourhood of Humbermede, was cycling past the bungalow situated beneath the massive oak at 76 Coral Gable Dr. and spotted a woman crying in the driveway.
When Ms. George stopped to see what was wrong, the woman told her she needed help saving a beloved tree in her backyard from some cruel neighbours. Local kids had been attacking it with rocks and older neighbours saw the 24metre oak as a threat that needed to be trimmed or felled to prevent property damage or injury.
"Now, I always knew there was a big honkin' tree back there, but I had no idea," Ms. George recalls.
"She took me to the backyard and I'm telling you, my legs nearly buckled. I told her right then, ‘I will help you.' " For the next decade and a half, Ms. George would fight to preserve one of the city's oldest and biggest trees - a quixotic-seeming quest that concluded successfully in recent weeks when the city made good on commitment to buy the $860,000 property after the community managed to raise half the cost. While previous homeowners who have lived under the tree have cherished it, this will ensure its protection for generations to come.
"If the city didn't go through with the purchase, I was going to mortgage my house," said Ms. George, who is on a first-name basis with the tree, having named it Zhelevo after her ancestral village in Macedonia. "I was not going to lose Zhelevo."
In this year of loss, the big tree on Coral Gable Drive is testament to survival. Pestilence and droughts, hand-saws and bulldozers - she has endured it all to become one of the city's oldest trees, somewhere between 250 and 300 years old and still thriving.
That would make her a mere sprout during the heyday of the nearby Carrying Place Trail, the Indigenous route branching north from Lake Ontario that made the future site of Toronto into a strategic gateway to valuable trade networks.
The trail ran along the eastern bank of the Cobechenonk, known today as the Humber River, right past Zhelevo's outstretched limbs.
"The tree's story can help tell our story," said Carolyn King, former chief of the Mississaugas of the New Credit First Nation, which called the area home for thousands of years before settler encroachment and dubious treaties forced them to move 90 kilometres southwest. "It's the story of how the tree stayed and our people left."
Ms. King is also the founder of The Moccasin Identifier project that identifies and marks significant Indigenous cultural sites.
She's visited the tree on a few occasions and intends to add it to that list as soon as it officially lands in public hands.
"Our people hunted and fished in the area regularly and travelled in the area," she said. "A tree like that would have been a marker to show the way."
As Zhelevo reached maturity, the route's primary users would change from Mississaugas, Wendat and Onondaga travellers to European traders and settlers.
In 1961, Michael and Anne Nicholas purchased the property for $14,400 and fell in love with the backyard tree even though the roots were growing perilously close to the bungalow's foundation. Mr. Nicholas built trenches and catch basins to convey water to the tree.
"He did everything possible to save this tree," said Ms. George.
"When he was lying in bed dying of throat cancer and visitors came, he would point out the window and say, ‘look what I saved.' " A daughter, Anne Doane, took over the house and, with it, responsibility for the tree. She was the one crying in the driveway that day Ms. George rolled by.
Over the years, Ms. George had a parade of well-known arborists come and assess Zhelevo. All have been blown away.
"It's a perfectly well-bred specimen," said Jack Radecki, former executive director of the Ontario Urban Forest Council. "If you look up through the canopy, there's a branch filling every void. It's a perfectly spaced scaffold system.
It's perfect. It's just an amazing tree."
By 2018, that scaffold started to envelop the bungalow. The trunk had grown to a circumference of 16 feet, four inches. The canopy stretched wider than the home.
Limbs scraped within inches of the roofline, persuading a subsequent owner to put the place up for sale. Ms. George's efforts took on a new urgency.
"She contacted me and said the real estate is for sale, we need to buy it," said gardening author and broadcaster Mark Cullen. "I became quite enthused."
Mr. Cullen and his wife Mary decided to help launch a fundraising campaign with a $100,000 donation.
The money was based on the condition that the public raise the first $430,000 with the city matching. With around 1,300 individual donors contributing to the cause, the city voted to buy the property on Nov. 26. It will take on responsibility for demolishing the house and developing a park around the tree.
"I really hope they dedicate the park to our Indigenous brethren," said Mr. Cullen, "the people who settled and made this area their home long before Europeans arrived. We have an opportunity to say something positive to the Indigenous community."
Ms. King, the former chief, would welcome the gesture. "It can tell the stories of our people rather than those who came after," she said. "It's an amazing feeling being there and thinking it was there when our people were there. It's an important tree. It survived."

Before the pandemic, sales had been increasing in Ontario's Niagara region and areas well outside of the country's most expensive markets of Toronto and Vancouver. After the COVID-19 health crisis started, that trend accelerated with a large chunk of the labour force working from home and travel severely restricted.
Thirty regions in Canada hit record sales from January through November, with most in smaller markets in Ontario, Quebec, Manitoba, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, according to new data from the Canadian Real Estate Association, or CREA. Ottawa and Montreal, two large cities that were booming before the pandemic, also had record sales over the same time period.
"The dominant force is the sudden acceptance, and necessity, of remote working," said Douglas Porter, chief economist with Bank of Montreal.
The ability to work from home, along with record low mortgage rates and increasing wealth among already wealthy homeowners, has fuelled sales of detached houses and low-rise properties. Mr. Porter, other economists and realtors also point to the limited travel options as a reason for higher home sales in vacation locations.
"Ability to work remotely has made the economics of cottage property make more sense. For example, it's no longer just a Friday night to Sunday afternoon proposition," said Robert Kavcic, senior economist with BMO.
"With travel shut down, a lot of people are repurposing those dollars into local recreation properties."
Muskoka-Haliburton, Ontario's prime cottage country, recorded 3,047 home sales from January through November, according to CREA. That was 40 per cent higher than the average over the past decade. The HalifaxDartmouth area in Nova Scotia had 7,050 sales over the same period, which is 25 per cent above the average. Ottawa hit 18,258 sales, 16 per cent above the average.
Other areas that had record sales from January through November include Timmins, Sault Ste. Marie and Renfrew in Ontario; Sherbrooke, Gatineau and Trois-Rivières in Quebec; Cape Breton and South Shore in Nova Scotia; and northern New Brunswick, according to CREA.
"It reflects the desire to be away from core cities, and the remote working capability makes this desire a reality," said Benjamin Tal, deputy chief economist with CIBC. "This is a trend that started before the crisis and was accelerated dramatically during the crisis."
Quebec and the Maritimes have been setting records in recent years. Ontario and British Columbia had lower sales than in 2016, a year when home prices in Toronto and Vancouver were skyrocketing. Both cities slowed in the ensuing years because of new policies to thwart housing speculators and ensure that homebuyers could afford their loans.
Competition was starting to heat up in late 2019. But after the pandemic started, condo sales slowed in Toronto. Condos in the city of Toronto are the only property type to experience a decline in prices this year.
In contrast, many parts of Ontario have seen prices increase by double digits. The home price index, which corrects for expensive purchases, is up nearly 30 per cent in the 12 months to November in Kawartha Lakes, Quinte and Woodstock-Ingersoll, according to CREA. The association said this huge price increase reflects the shortage of properties for sale. The home price index is up by 20 per cent in Niagara, Grey Bruce Owen Sound and North Bay.
CIBC's Mr. Tal expects the trend to slow after the pandemic and said rapidly increasing prices will shut buyers out of the cheaper areas.

Full text: To search St. Barts on Instagram is to discover a land untouched by the anxieties of a world besieged by a pandemic.
The photo-sharing site surfaces pictures of people in various forms of undress, puckering, smiling and smirking without any mask to obstruct their sun-kissed faces. Speedboats buzz among anchored yachts like pollinating bees. The streets in December are busy with famous visitors such as Chrissy Teigen, John Legend and Paul McCartney. Ontario Finance Minister Rod Phillips also headed to the island this month, causing a political storm at home in his locked-down province.
On Airbnb, the cheapest available place is a one-bedroom pad going for $1,149 a night, but at least one $50,000-a-night villa was still available for New Year's Eve, always one of the island's busiest nights of the year.
This year will be no exception.
"The jet set will come again for New Year's Eve this year," said Romain Garin Laurel, chief executive officer of Entourage Villas Group, a high-end villa rental and real estate company, and StBarths.com, a travel website.
"They are arriving already. It's full.
It's packed."
Saint-Barthélemy, abbreviated to St. Barts in English and St.
Barths in French, first became a beacon to the rich and famous in the late 1950s, when David Rockefeller bought a massive estate.
"He brought all of his friends," Mr. Laurel said. "And the magic starts like this."
They came for the parties and stayed for the 16 pristine beaches, perfect temperatures and rugged landscape. In 1978, Jimmy Buffett sailed into the capital of Gustavia and was so enchanted he decided he would be buried there one day, according to an interview in The New York Times.
Today, it's considered the most expensive island in the Caribbean.
Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich purchased a portion of the former Rockefeller estate for US$90-million in 2009. Sotheby's currently lists 20 properties for sale on the island.
The cheapest one measures just 62 square metres and goes for $2.7-million. The most expensive is 20 times that. "St. Barts is luxury," Mr. Laurel said.
"Its sister island, Saint Martin, is considered the friendly island.
It has a casino and this kind of entertainment."
In 2017, Hurricane Irma obliterated the island, sinking power boats and peeling roofs from luxury hotels.
While Puerto Rico and other nearby islands have yet to fully recover, St. Barts roared back to life with the largesse of well-heeled patrons such as Mr. Buffett, who bankrolled supply flights to the island and gave a benefit concert in Gustavia.
The pandemic closed the island to visitors in March, but authorities opened it back up on June 22.
COVID-19 restrictions are minimal. Travellers to St. Barts require a negative COVID-19 test taken no more than 72 hours before arriving. On the ground, the island's restaurants can seat no more than six diners at a table. Masks are encouraged on the busy streets and inside the Bulgari, Cartier, Louis Vuitton and other local shops.
By raw numbers, the COVID-19 caseload seems low on the island, with the average number of new daily cases rarely topping two.
But with a population of around just 9,000, two cases a day works out to a rate of 22.22 per 100,000, roughly the same as Alberta.
Although an increase in visitors will almost surely mean an increase in COVID-19 cases, Mr. Laurel said residents don't seem concerned. "This is business," he said. "These two weeks [over the holidays] are extremely busy and important for the island's economy."
There's easy access to rapid PCR tests and antigenic tests, according to Bruno Magras, President of the island, an overseas collectivity of France. "We have never had any deaths or emergency transfers due to COVID," he told The Globe and Mail. "Yes, as of today, St. Barts is doing well. We have a lot of celebrities on the island."
Why do they keep coming in the middle of a pandemic? Tranquility and privacy, the same reasons as Mr. Rockefeller and Mr. Buffett years ago.
"It's a pretty chill island," Mr. Laurel said. "They come here not to be seen."

Saudi court sentences women's activist to nearly six years in prison

Full text: The family of Loujain al-Hathloul, one of Saudi Arabia's most prominent women'srights activists and a University of B.C.
graduate, wants Canada and its allies to keep speaking out against the kingdom's human-rights violations after their sister was sentenced to nearly six years in prison on terrorism-related charges.
Walid al-Hathloul, who lives in Toronto and works for a local real estate developer, told The Globe and Mail that Canada, the United States and European countries need to reject the Saudi persecution of activists such as his 31-year-old sister, whom state-linked media reported was sentenced Monday under a vague and broadly worded counterterrorism law.
In 2018, Global Affairs Canada triggered a furious backlash from Riyadh when it supported Ms. al-Hathloul and other protesters by posting on Twitter that Canada was "gravely concerned about ... arrests of civil-society and women's-rights activists."
"What happened in 2018 [to Canada] should be avoided and the only way to do that is to work closely with allies in Europe and the United States," said Mr. al-Hathloul, who settled in Canada after graduating last year from York University's Schulich School of Business because he is blocked from leaving Saudi Arabia if he returns.
"That will make it more powerful and will avoid any diplomatic crisis."
Ms. al-Hathloul was among a number of activists rounded up in 2018, the year Saudi Arabia lifted a long-standing ban on women driving but accompanied that move with a crackdown on activists who had campaigned against the ban. Saudi Arabia's international reputation was further damaged that year when its agents murdered dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the country's consulate in Istanbul.
Alia al-Hathloul, the eldest of the activist's five siblings, told The Globe Monday in a phone interview from her home in Belgium that countries such as Canada can also use trade to press Saudi Arabia, which depends on its participation in the global economy.
"All international pressure can make things improve in Saudi Arabia, so countries do not need to undermine or underestimate their efforts," she said. "Their efforts, their pressure has a positive impact on Saudi Arabia - it's connected to the rest of the world."
In a short e-mailed statement, Angela Savard, a spokesperson for Global Affairs Canada, called Monday's sentencing "deeply troubling."
"We understand that early release is possible and advocate for it," the statement said. "True to our democratic values and principles, Canada will always stand with human-rights activists and defenders around the world."
Canadian diplomats were shut out of observing his sister's recent trial, according to Mr. alHathloul. He said his sister will appeal Monday's ruling, but his family has little hope in the Saudi justice system.
Ms. al-Hathloul could be released in March because a sizable portion of her sentence was suspended, according to rights group Prisoners of Conscience, which focuses on Saudi political detainees.
Ms. al-Hathloul has long been defiantly outspoken about human rights in Saudi Arabia, even from behind bars. She launched hunger strikes to protest against her imprisonment and joined other female activists in telling Saudi judges that she was tortured and sexually assaulted by masked men during interrogations. The women say they were caned, electrocuted and waterboarded. Some say they were forcibly groped and threatened with rape.
In many ways, her case came to symbolize Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's dual strategy of being credited for ushering in sweeping social reforms and simultaneously cracking down on activists who had long pushed for change.
Ms. al-Hathloul rejected an offer to rescind her allegations of torture in exchange for early release, according to her family. A court recently dismissed her allegations, citing a lack of evidence.
Among other allegations was that one of the masked interrogators was Saud al-Qahtani, a close confidant and adviser to Mr. bin Salman at the time. Mr. al-Qahtani was later sanctioned by the U.S. for his alleged role in the assassination of Mr. Khashoggi.
Ms. al-Hathloul's continued imprisonment was likely to be a point of contention in relations between the kingdom and the incoming presidency of Joe Biden, whose inauguration takes place in January.
Mr. Biden has vowed to review the U.S.-Saudi relationship and take into greater consideration human rights and democratic principles. He has also vowed to reverse President Donald Trump's policy of giving Saudi Arabia "a blank cheque to pursue a disastrous set of policies," including the targeting of female activists.
Ms. al-Hathloul's activism landed her a Nobel Peace Prize nomination and extensive media coverage, such as a Vanity Fair photo shoot in Ottawa next to future Duchess of Sussex Meghan Markle.
It was clear that she intended to return home to Saudi Arabia to advocate for women's rights after graduating in Canada, says a friend who got to know her while studying at the University of British Columbia.
"She wanted to go back to Saudi Arabia," said Atiya Jaffar, who attended the Vancouver campus from 2009 to 2013. "All of the activism that she engaged in after graduation, I believe she did it out of a love for her people and her country."

Quantum Park has room for Vancouver's growing tech sector

Full text: False Creek, the small inner harbour that separates Vancouver's downtown peninsula from the western half of the city, used to be a hub of industrial activity in the city's early days: ironworks, barrel makers, pulp mills, breweries.
Molson Coors, the last brewery plant in the area, closed in 2015. Now, the new owner of the site - developer Concord Pacific, which made its name in the past 30 years by building a forest of residential condos on the northern side of False Creek - has created a hyper-futuristic plan to replace the buildings of vats, production lines and barrels.
The development, branded as Quantum Park, spans almost three hectares, offering plenty of space for meeting rooms for business and quiet respite spots for pleasure.
Pending city approval to rezone the industrial land, which Concord purchased for $164.8million, plans for the tech-oriented, campus-style complex reveal a blend of office space with residential condos, including meeting rooms for those who work from home. The atrium of the commercial office building can be used as an event space, for example, to hear visiting speakers, play host to mini-conventions or hold social mixers.
"The idea is that people can have a life-and-work lifestyle," says Peter Webb, senior vicepresident at Concord Pacific.
"They can spin off each other's activities and ideas."
Local tech-industry insiders see the proposed concept as a welcome addition in Vancouver, where the tech sector has been expanding steadily - everything from Amazon.com Inc.
and Hootsuite Media Inc. to gaming and cybersecurity software development - resulting, prepandemic, in one of the lowest office vacancy rates in North America.
With local universities turning out large numbers of graduates with tech skills, the region is considered a strong contender for tech business. As well, Canada is admitting many immigrants with tech skills into the country.
Unlike many older cities in Canada and the United States, Vancouver lacks large swaths of abandoned industrial space. One exception is the vacated Molson Coors brewery site. Located on the edge of popular Kitsilano, which has beaches, an indoor swimming pool, tennis courts and a cluster of trendy restaurants, the area is ideal to support the lifestyle of young tech employees. A walkway along False Creek and a converted bike lane at the southern end of Burrard Bridge provide access to walking and biking.
Although some tech companies, notably Twitter and Google, have told employees they can work from home indefinitely, some industry insiders, including commercial brokers, say the tech office is not likely to disappear postpandemic.
"We've discovered that people can be very productive when they're distributed," says Jill Tipping, president of the BC Tech Association, "but to be creative, to generate new ideas, requires unscheduled interactions. So being in a campus with different companies around [is] quite appealing."
Alain Rivère, associate vicepresident with CBRE in Vancouver who specializes in tech leases, agrees employers are moving away from thinking employees can just work at home forever.
"Tech companies were able to work better than expected at home, but many are now saying, ‘We really see the value of the office - we're just going to do it differently.' " It's uncertain whether people really want to live that close to work, but based on the 10,000 condos Concord Pacific manages, where people are already converting their buildings into co-working spaces, Mr. Webb is confident they do. The company's British project Marylebone Square, which is located next to a 600,000-square-foot Amazon office in London, also supports it. Quantum Park, he says, is the next level up because it incorporates office spaces, garden spaces and interior courtyards for visiting speakers or small meet-ups, all in one development.
As the land is currently zoned for industrial purposes, the big question is what the city will allow on that site. To date, city planners have been non-committal about rezoning the area.
Mr. Webb says he believes industrial use alone won't result in the type and number of jobs the city needs, whereas a development like Quantum could potentially accommodate thousands of people who can live and work there.
"Molson employed 250 people at its [peak employment]," he says.
"This is an opportunity to create a lot of jobs for Vancouver."

Full text: It will take at least two years and more than $20-million to turn the 150 rooms of the shuttered Regent Hotel in the Downtown Eastside into affordable housing with about half the number of units, the head of B.C.'s government housing agency says.
Shayne Ramsay, BC Housing's chief executive officer, estimates it could take even more time and money to replace the Balmoral, the 165-unit hotel across the street. The City of Vancouver expropriated both hotels last month from the Sahota family. The Balmoral is damaged beyond repair, he said, and will likely be torn down and redeveloped. He said the site could become part of a larger development if Vancouver buys neighbouring properties.
Mr. Ramsay's estimates are the first official snapshot of what will be required to replace some or all of the 300 units of housing at the twin hotels, which were ordered closed more than two years ago after decades of neglect and the failure of the city and its inspectors to keep conditions from becoming unlivable.
"We didn't arrive in 2018 and just wake up and find out the Regent and Balmoral were buildings that were in very, very poor condition," Mr. Ramsay said. "It happened over a period of literally decades, that's one of the important pieces to understand.
The Globe and Mail reported earlier this month that the city spent more than $7.5-million for the Balmoral and Regent hotels, which was the amount city staff had estimated they would cost two years ago in an internal memo obtained by The Globe. The city has faced criticism for keeping the value of the deal secret at the insistence of the Sahota family, which a 2018 Globe investigation found had real estate holdings - about 40 properties in and around Vancouver - worth an estimated $218-million.
New social housing units cost at least $350,000 each to build, Mr. Ramsay said. To replace the Balmoral's 165 units at this rate would cost about $57-million.
He estimated that a year of technical work will be needed at the Regent, then a year and a half of renovations. Most of the nearly 160 units there did not have their own bathrooms. The repaired building will likely have half that many apartments, he said, because all will include bathrooms and small kitchens.
Fiona York, a co-ordinator at the Carnegie Community Action Project, said those renovated units would be a big improvement. She and other local housing activists held a town hall two summers ago to canvass the community on what to do with the properties, and heard near-unanimous support for self-contained units rather than the dorm-style living still common in many older rentals in the area. A majority of people, many of whom were former tenants, also wanted both buildings torn down, Ms. York said.
"They're such a place of horror and bad memories," Ms. York said.
She added that Mayor Kennedy Stewart must stand by his commitment to work with the community on any developments that replace the hotels.
Mr. Ramsay said he does not know the status of the city's attempt to buy properties west of the Balmoral and create a larger development.
Two of Vancouver's top bureaucrats discussed that option in a confidential memo dated Sept. 19, 2018. The city reached out to the owners of four properties, including developer Concord Pacific, to gauge their willingness to sell.
This bundle of property was independently appraised at about $10million total, the memo said.
A city spokesperson said last week in an e-mailed a statement that "we are looking at all options" when asked whether a land assembly is still being pursued.
Private landlords still own and operate just over 40 per cent of the area's 6,681 small dorm-style units, known as single room occupancy (SRO), according to report by city staff released in June. That report recommended the city continue to pursue partnerships with BC Housing and Ottawa to improve the aging SRO housing stock while working to replace it with new self-contained units.
Scott Clark, a local activist and executive director of the Aboriginal Life in Vancouver Enhancement Society, said replacing the Regent, Balmoral and other SRO hotels is not as good as selling the land and using the money to develop more social housing in other parts of Vancouver, where residents often put up fierce opposition.
"If I had a map in front of me of all 24 neighborhoods and we looked at where [governments] put all the social housing, it would be abundantly clear what they're doing and why they're doing it," Mr. Clark, adding most of this housing of last resort is still in the Downtown Eastside.

Full text: Amy Makortoff says it's hard not to take the rejections personally after spending nine months looking for a rental home in Nelson, B.C.
She said she rarely got to even hear a landlord's voice on the phone before their property was snapped up in interior B.C.'s competitive market. The lifelong Nelson local and one of her daughters slept for months on a mattress on a floor while they were housesitting and searching for a rental home of their own. All of their essentials were packed in a plastic tub, and Ms. Makortoff's optimism was almost gone.
This week, she finally moves in to a new home, although the house comes with the caveat of being more than a 30-minute drive from town.
Ms. Makortoff has a job lined up and has lived in the city for years, but landlords will often cite simple things - or even her children - as a negative.
"Children seem to be a big factor for people, which is really insulting and upsetting," said Ms. Makortoff, adding that tenants are forced to sell themselves as if they were applying for a job.
"I've never as a renter had this much trouble. ... Right now I feel homeless, I have all my things in a storage locker."
Ms. Makortoff is one of many who are struggling to find affordable homes during a housing crisis throughout interior B.C.
Realtors, residents and politicians say COVID-19 has only worsened the situation as more Canadians look to work remotely - and in turn increase competition and prices for limited stock in scenic communities such as Nelson.
Adding pressure is the resurgence of natural resource industries such as manufacturing, forestry and mining after they initially faltered during COVID-19. Such companies look for employees in exactly the kind of interior municipalities that are already grappling with supply and don't have the capacity to house additional workers.
Nelson CARES Society, a community organization, said in its annual report that the city currently has a 0.4 per cent vacancy rate, and rising prices mean half of renter households pay 30 per cent or more of their income toward their lease.
Interior B.C. realtors in Fernie and Revelstoke say the situation is similar, and there was a noticeable uptick in remote workers from out-of-town looking for housing this year.
"People are definitely finding interior B.C., and they're saying, ‘Wow, this is a great place to be,' " said Lori Russell, a realtor in Fernie.
"Sales have been very brisk during COVID. Lots of things that come on the market ... if you don't pounce on it the first day, it's gone."
The situation leaves people such as Ms. Makortoff with mixed feelings. She shares custody of two of her children with their father, so she can't simply relocate to another city.
"It's frustrating because I know that people are moving here because it's a better life, and that's why I'm here," she said.
She believes anybody should be able to enjoy the way of life in Nelson. "But I've felt that sentiment a tiny little bit: Stop moving here, I need a home, house our local people first."
Ms. Makortoff said there were stark differences in her search for a home this time compared with a couple years ago. The two-bedroom house she left in 2019 cost $1,450 a month. She's had to adjust her budget to $1,800 a month, but many of the listings she found were as high as $2,600.
Nelson Mayor John Dooley said the city faces a slew of challenges when it comes to expanding affordable housing, including a shortage of available land, the high cost of delivering building material, and the complicated task of laying foundation on a mountainside town with many waterways.
But Mr. Dooley says people who work in Nelson can look to surrounding communities that are a half hour drive away, as Ms. Makortoff did.
"It's very reasonable to live in this area within 30 minutes of Nelson," Mr. Dooley said. "But if you want to live in the core of our city, there hasn't been a lot of [single-family dwellings] built in the last 20 years."
He called the drive along mountain highways "therapeutic," unlike commutes in bigger cities such as Vancouver or Toronto.
But Trevor Jenkinson, president of the West Kootenay Landlord Society and a property manager in Nelson, said rental markets in smaller communities are also facing pressure.
"The way I describe it is Nelson is the peak of the tentpole," said Mr. Jenkinson, who manages nearly 100 properties in the area. "When the prices in Nelson go up, it pulls up the other areas."
He says apartment listings in Nelson will often receive 40 or 50 responses, and smaller markets such as Castlegar or Trail are becoming competitive markets as a result.
Further east in Alberta, mountain towns are facing similar problems.
Banff and Canmore initially experienced a significant spike in vacancies at the onset of the pandemic, but the rental market is starting to pick up again.
Canmore councillor Joanna McCallum said she's concerned about the advent of people working remotely in desirable towns such as hers, and the impact it will have on the community's decades-long issues with affordable housing.
"Right now we're seeing a lot of people become homeless or struggle with housing in general more than ever, which is really scary and shocking," said Ms. McCallum, adding that the issue makes COVID-19 an even more substantial problem for vulnerable people.
"Now that people can work from home more easily and acceptably, I wonder if those folks are going to put even more pressure on our housing market and continue to squeeze local people out."
She said the town has identified housing as its No. 1 concern for years, and is working to help develop apartment buildings and tweak residential laws to allow for higher density.
Two hundred and fifty rental units will come on the market in the next six months as two new buildings are completed, and Ms. McCallum says council will look closely at whether that has a substantial effect on stabilizing rental prices.
Dan Sparks, a realtor for 20 years, says Canmore has also seen a rise in housing sales.
Housing sales plummeted in April - one the region's busiest months for transactions - with only 12 properties sold in 2020 compared with 76 the year prior.
But sales were back to normal by June, and rose sharply in July with 81 houses sold compared with 53 in July, 2019.
Mr. Sparks, a former member of the Canmore Community Housing board, believes the numbers are a direct result of people wanting to live in lower density communities with ample recreation after experiencing the pandemic in cities such as Calgary.
Banff has been spared from such housing activity, partly because its location in a national park means that residents have to prove a need to actually reside there, such as a full-time job.
As a result, councillor Grant Canning estimates Banff's vacancy rate is at 15 per cent, up from zero before the pandemic.
The rise in vacancy is a result of so many local jobs being directly tied to tourism. At one point during the first lockdown, Banff's unemployment rate reached an astounding 85 per cent according to a local MLA.
He expects that a rebound in the housing situation will be in sync with a rebound in the tourism industry, although the city isn't projecting full economic activity to resume until 2023.
In Canmore, Mr. Sparks said the town will likely join interior B.C. in its rental woes when tourism returns to normal in the post-COVID world.
"Once the borders open up and we have international tourists coming up, eventually that's going to be absorbed and we're going to need more rental units," Mr. Sparks said.
"We're cognizant of the fact that affordable housing will always be an issue in Canmore."
Realtors and city workers throughout the region agree there isn't an easy solution to the crisis, but many say there needs to be more incentive to build affordable rental units.
"Any small little desirable town, I'm looking at you Rossland, Fernie, Nelson ... they're all struggling with this question of people coming [from] outside their community and taking up some of their housing, and then there's not enough housing available for local people," Ms. McCallum said.
She's concerned that what's left for locals usually doesn't match local salaries and is sub-standard.
"It just keeps happening."
Ms. Makortoff, the single mother from Nelson, said the only units she was able to see toward the end of her search were run down, with only one bedroom to house herself and her three daughters. But at that point, people made her feel ashamed for turning them down.
"It's almost like people forget that I'm a human who has a right to a normal home," Ms. Makortoff said.
"People just think, ‘This is the world now, you're not going to find something in your price range.' "

Full text: Parts of British Columbia could see massive losses if the province doesn't start planning for flooding as ocean waters rise and storms surge owing to climate change, says a researcher at the University of B.C. in Vancouver.
B.C. lacks a much-needed overarching authority to oversee coastal flood management and ecosystem conservation, said Kees Lokman, a professor of landscape architecture and the head of the university's coastal adaptation lab.
Prof. Lokman recently received a $1-million grant for a four-year project dubbed "Living with Water," which aims to set the foundation for a comprehensive, co-ordinated coastal flood adaptation plan in the province.
The findings will be available in an open-source database that will function as a tool kit to help communities plan for the future, he said.
The resources should help local and regional governments evaluate the merits and tradeoffs of different adaptation options, he said, from reinforcing existing shorelines to retreating to higher ground.
"We have time," Prof. Lokman said. "But we need a concerted effort and we need to be strategic in terms of how we protect, where we protect and when."
The majority of B.C. residents live within a few kilometres of the province's coastline, with more than 60 per cent living in the Lower Mainland.
Sea levels in the region are expected to rise around half a metre by 2050 and one metre by 2100, according to a report commissioned by the B.C. Environment Ministry in 2013, while coastlines in Atlantic Canada may be even more sensitive to encroaching ocean waters.
That report recommends a decision-making framework and outlines 21 different approaches to support local adaptation to rising seas.
But communities still lack the technical and ecological knowledge, policy guidance, funding and other supports they need, Prof. Lokman said.
"Some municipalities have a coastal manager or an engineer that is strictly dealing with coastal issues, but in many municipalities, they have a storm-water engineer that also now needs to become a coastal engineer," he said.
NASA has measured sea level rise along the U.S. West Coast near B.C. at 0.4 inches or just over one centimetre a year in the past five years.
One of the most serious consequences of rising seas is the risk of extreme flooding typically associated with storm surges coinciding with high tides.
"If we wouldn't have storm surges, it would be a lot easier," Prof. Lokman said.
The Vancouver International Airport and critical shipping infrastructure in B.C.'s Lower Mainland are vulnerable to coastal flooding, he said.
Swaths of B.C.'s agricultural land reserve are located in the Fraser River flood plain and surging water could threaten food security, he added.
Sandbags can be found along the shore of popular beaches in Vancouver during "king tides" to limit nuisance flooding, said Prof.
Lokman, adding the highest tides of the season are a good indicator of what's to come.
"Where we're seeing flooding [with] king tide now, those areas will be permanently flooded, likely, with half a metre sea level rise."
The losses from rising seas and storm surges could be "tremendous," said Prof. Lokman, from coastal habitats to real estate to culturally significant sites.
The best approaches to adaptation in some populous areas are conventional options such as dikes and seawalls, said Prof. Lokman, pointing to False Creek in Vancouver. The inlet is lined with condos and major infrastructure, including the Vancouver Canucks' hockey arena and Granville Island, a popular artist and tourist hub.
Other places are candidates for nature-based options for mitigating rising waters, such as floating wetlands and kelp beds, clam gardens and living dikes built up from sediment deposits instead of concrete, Prof. Lokman said.
Such solutions can protect coastal habitats and wetlands that store carbon more efficiently than any other natural ecosystem, including forests.
Living with Water involves partners across B.C.'s southern coast, including municipalities, legal experts and the Squamish and Tsleil-Waututh First Nations, as well as the provincial government, Prof. Lokman said.
The first step among the array of interdisciplinary researchers and project partners is to develop a shared understanding of what coastal adaptation means, he said, including how to integrate Indigenous knowledge.
The latest mandate letter for B.C. Environment Minister George Heyman includes a directive to support work with other ministries aimed at developing "a new provincial coastal strategy to better protect coastal habitat while growing coastal economies."
Representatives for the ministry did not immediately respond to questions about the province's plans to address sea level rise and floods.
The Pacific Institute for Climate Solutions is funding the project.

Six edge-of-your-seat thrillers to get you through the holidays

Full text: The Kingdom, Jo Nesbo, translated by Robert Ferguson (Random House, 548 pages) First and most important, this is not a Harry Hole novel.
Those awaiting Norway's only serial-killer specialist must be patient; they should also read this book and continue to be patient. The opening, which is all important, sets the mood, scene and backstory and it's very slow. The setting is the rural Norwegian village of Os, a picturesque nowhere with nothing to offer. Roy Opgard, owner of the local gas station/snack store is our narrator and he is, to say the least, unforthcoming. But Os is about to have a renaissance - Roy's brother Carl Abel has arrived from the United States with his new wife, Shannon. Carl Abel, who fled Os years ago, has become a wealthy real estate entrepreneur in Minnesota and Canada and plans to turn the Opgard farm, "The Kingdom," into a flourishing hotel spa. There will be jobs, cafés and success galore.
We know this is not going to turn out well but it's the trip that captures the imagination. There are more than enough secrets and lies here to keep a reader happy. Nesbo doesn't need another grisly serial murder. Whatever you do: Do not read the end first.
Still Life, Val McDermid (Grove/Atlantic, 437 pages) This is the sixth Karen Pirie book and Scotland's pre-eminent cold case detective has her work cut out for her. A lobster fisherman discovers a dead body and there's a longtime missing politician to find. In short, this is McDermid at her best. The dead man turns out to be a naturalized French citizen but that ID simply covers up the fact that he came into existence only 10 years before. So, who was he really? As Pirie and her team unravel the French tale, another crime takes place and that leads to a man who disappeared 10 years ago, a politician caught in a scandal involving art works stolen from Scotland's National Collection and replaced with forgeries so good that they passed inspections.
McDermid always gives us a fine plot and terrific characters but this time she's outdone herself. The art forgery backdrop and the twists it adds keep this plot going and the history of the dead man in the lobster trap kept me reading far into the night.
The Darkest Evening, Ann Cleeves (Macmillan, 373 pages) Setting is a major component in all Ann Cleeves's brilliant series and this latest one in the Vera Stanhope saga takes full advantage of the dark, sinister cold of a Northumbrian December. Cleeves uses the story to fill in some interesting background on Vera herself, as well as giving us one of her very best and most intriguing mystery novels. Vera is out too late on a bad road in a snowstorm. Driving blind, she gets lost and ends up at a farm fence where a car has run off the road. When she checks it, she finds a small baby in a car seat. There is every indication that the parent went searching for help but why leave the doors open? Vera leaves a note and packs up the infant. She ends up at Brockburn, the local gentry's vast mansion, and the gentry happen to be named Stanhope and Vera knows she'll be tolerated but not welcomed.
The backstory of Vera and the other Stanhopes is every bit as dramatic and fascinating as the mystery of the abandoned baby and, as we can expect, the body discovered in the snow on Brockburn's extensive grounds. Was it murder or accident due to weather? Again, you can't stop reading this one until the final page.
Invisible Girl, Lisa Jewell (Atria, 356 pages) Lisa Jewell specializes in psychological suspense - the oldfashioned thriller that depends on character, not clues.
Lately, some of her books have been uneven. Invisible Girl is her best book to date, with its simple but complex plot, brilliant characters and careful construction.
The story is set in upmarket London and rests on three major characters. Owen Pick is single, living with his mother and has just been suspended from his teaching position because of allegations of sexual misconduct. Across the street from Owen live the Fours. Cate is a physiotherapist and Roan is a psychologist. They find Owen creepy and suspect he's been following their teenaged daughter home from school. Saffyre Maddox is a former patient of Roan's and she's obsessed with him. When Saffyre disappears, the investigation inevitably opens the cracks in the Fours marriage and makes Owen a logical suspect.
Strangely, while the case of the missing Saffyre is the plotline, it's not the meat of the novel. The Fours marriage, Owen's dive into the dark world of the involuntary celibates (incels) and the elegant upscale world these people inhabit is really what makes this book move.
The Detective And The Spy, Angela Misri (Cormorant Books, 235 pages) If Sherlock Holmes had a granddaughter, she'd definitely be a clever and devilishly curious woman like Portia Adams. That's what Misri - who has written several essays on Holmes, as well as three other Adams books - believes and she's convinced me. This is my introduction to the PA canon and while it's not as enthralling - yet - as Conan Doyle's own, it's a very good start.
This isn't Sherlock's London: It's 1935 and the Great Depression is nearly over but things are changing over in Europe. Portia has taken over the Consulting Detective business at 221B Baker Street and she's enjoying some success.
Then a bomb goes off, literally, and blows Portia and her world apart. She awakens in a hospital, deaf and mute.
While Portia begins to examine her changed circumstances, the bomber is wreaking havoc across London.
Portia believes she can still contribute to solving the crimes but everyone from her old friends to Scotland Yard dismisses her as disabled. How Portia begins to investigate the crimes from her new perspective is the heart of the character development of this book and Misri does a fair job of taking us into the world of silence.
En route to the denouement, many old friends of Sherlock appear, along with friends of Portia and an interesting possible love interest. This indicates a long-running series with more adventures to come.
Tell Me My Name, Erin Ruddy (Dundurn, 344 pages) I wanted to love this book. It's a debut from a new writer and the premise, laid out early, is great. A nice young couple, Neil and Ellie, are basking in a child-free weekend at their gorgeous new country cottage.
It's all very upmarket Muskoka and sexy and wild. Then, the pair are dragged out of bed by a neighbour who claims to have been Ellie's lover. "What's my name?" he demands. As he takes the pair prisoner, it's clear that he's obsessed, but Ellie has no idea who he is. He gives her three chances to get his name. After that, he starts carving bits off Neil and if she doesn't get it right, Neil will die. If Erin Ruddy had kept up the pace for the rest of the novel, this book would have been a smash.
However, the pace drops when Ellie does get the name.
This requires a lot of recall and backstory and things drag.
They drag further when the police arrive with a detective who tells people "toodle-oo." No, you just can't. Ever.
Despite the middle muddle, Ruddy gets the book back on track for a very solid and satisfying ending. This indicates she's got the talent, she just needs to work a bit harder on the execution and especially on developing characters. She's one to watch for.

Full text: As soon as Aeon Studio Group announced plans to convert a former manufacturing plant in Hamilton into production studios, they were getting calls from prospective tenants.
"While there are 900 filmrelated businesses and 9,000 people employed in production in Hamilton, until now there has not been a real film studio facility in the city," says Jeff Anders, a co-founder of Aeon, which has a master plan to build Hamilton into an international hub for film, television and digital media production.
The company took over the former manufacturing plant on Queen Street West the first week of December and is aiming to have it open as Aeon Bayfront Studios by Feb. 1.
The building's former owner, power equipment maker AVL Manufacturing Inc., is moving to a new location in the Hamilton area.
The studio will feature a 27,000-square-foot clear-span mainstage with a 50-foot ceiling, 40,000 square feet of additional production space of varying ceiling heights and 6,500 square feet of furnished offices.
In addition, there are four acres of outdoor space suitable for backlot uses, as well as a paint shop with two paint booths.
"We looked at several other buildings over the past three years and they were not nearly as good as this one," says Mr. Anders. The modern building will get additional soundproofing and electrical upgrades, but it is in exceptional condition, he adds.
The studio is located across the street from the BartonTiffany lands, a city redevelopment site of former industrial sites in the north end of Hamilton.
Aeon has longer-term plans to build on a 15-acre parcel it calls the Hamilton Studio District, a hub for the creative industries, which will feature studios, offices, retail and residential space. Aeon's real estate partner is Forge & Foster, a Hamilton-based investment firm.
"Hamilton is getting busier and busier because you can make it look like anywhere and the locals love us," comments Robbie David, an Aeon cofounder who has been producing films in Hamilton for many years.
As part of its services, Aeon also launched a location representation service, which helps productions find unique filming locations in the Hamilton area and arrange with property owners to offer their spaces up for rent for film and TV productions.
"Hamilton is a top 10 Canadian city, but it's not huge, so within a small radius you have locations that look like Chicago or New York; you have suburbia, the post-apocalyptic Stelco complex and the Niagara Escarpment within a 10-minute drive," Mr. David says.
"You can literally set up to shoot in an industrial setting and a forest in the same day."

Full text: It's lights, cameras and action - everywhere. While just a few months ago, it appeared COVID-19 was forcing a wrap for the film industry, there's now so much demand for production space that studios are expanding, and new ones are being built in all corners of the Greater Toronto Area.
"What the pandemic did was force a pause in production, but we have not altered course on our expansion plans," says Geoff Grant, general manager of Pinewood Toronto Studios, which is majority-owned by Bell Media.
Studio clients aren't changing their plans, either; "We're bursting at the seams and turning away viable productions because of the lack of space available."
Pinewood's complex on Toronto's Port Lands currently has 11 stages, including the Mega Stage, the second-largest in North America, which, at 46,000 square feet, can accommodate sets as tall as five storeys. It has been the studio for such blockbuster films as Suicide Squad, Pacific Rim, XXX: Return of Xander Cage and Downsizing, to name a few.
In November, Pinewood broke ground on an expansion that will add five more stages by early 2022, along with craft workshops in a project built by Ledcor Group of Companies and managed by Turner & Townsend.
Pinewood is one of several production centres located in Toronto's Port Lands, a redevelopment zone east of the city core. A pioneer in the Port Lands, Cinespace Film Studios is expanding with an additional 165,000 square feet of production space.
To the east of the Pinewood complex, a big site on Basin Street is about to add to the Port Lands creative cluster. City of Toronto's real estate agency, CreateTO, has invited proposals to build studios on an 8.9-acre former industrial site, renamed Basin Media Hub, that could include up to 500,000 square feet of creative spaces.
According to Vic Gupta, senior vice-president of strategic development for CreateTO, "Hollywood is coming north [because] we've got the facilities and a skilled work force that's world class," along with a supportive film office that makes it easy to get permits around the city. Another advantage is Port Lands' proximity to diverse locations throughout Toronto that can stand in for almost any city in North America.
Many studios are developed in retrofitted warehouses, but increasingly stages are being purpose-built to create height for hanging equipment and obstruction-free space within the building, Mr. Gupta says.
The city has developed renderings of Basin Media Hub, but they are tentative. The successful bidders will design and build their own facilities, with the land remaining city-owned on long-term leases, Mr. Gupta says. "There could be multiple tenants; we're leaving this up to the industry."
"We're looking for proposals with a sense of design and sustainability," he adds. "When fully developed, [Basin Media Hub] will be a destination not only for the industry but for the public." A waterfront promenade with public access along the edge of Lake Ontario is a requirement of the development.
And it's not just the Port Lands where studio capacity is expanding.
Industry equipment specialist William F. White International Inc. will open its third production centre in converted warehouses in Mississauga in February. The Whites Studios Cantay facility, which will include four studios, as well as offices and wardrobe space, joins recently opened Century Studio and another production centre, Edwards Blvd. Studio.
The company is continuing to scout for more production locations because there's an increasing demand, says Rick Perotto, White's vice-president of business development.
The Cantay facility is also close to another new TV and film production hub in Mississauga, CBS Stages Canada, which opened in 2019. The 260,000-square-foot complex on Matheson Boulevard East, near Dixie Road, features six soundstages, production offices and support facilities.
And in addition to expanding in the Port Lands, Cinespace has developed the 50,000-squarefoot Titan Studios as part of a multi-year expansion of its Kipling Campus in Etobicoke, west of the city core, where The Handmaid's Tale and Netflix's superhero series Titans were filmed.
"The industry is alive and well in Toronto," Mr. Gupta says. According to the Toronto Economic Development agency, it provided more than 44,000 jobs in the Toronto area and pumped more than $2-billion into the local economy in 2019.
"While everyone has had to take a deep breath for a while, everybody is very optimistic about the future."

Failed Toronto project is a lesson in the politics of urban density

Full text: The entire purpose of Toronto's Committee of Adjustment is to make exceptions to the restrictive zoning rules that govern what gets built where in the city. But a recent decision highlights how what we accept, or deny, can affect housing affordability and inequality.
On Dec. 2, the committee - which is made up of residents appointed by city council - denied a P & R Developments application for consent to sever a 50-foot lot at 2165 Gerrard St. E. and replace one home with two semi-detached buildings and two laneway suites that would have added 10 family-sized rental units to the neighbourhood.
"I don't believe dividing the property is in the best interest of the community," said committee member Carl Knipfel, himself an architect and planner who complimented the beauty of the existing house and critiqued the design of the new buildings.
"What is proposed is too dense. ... I really have serious concerns as to where this consent may lead us."
For urban planner Sean Galbraith, who represented the developers at the hearing, the decision was in many ways business as usual. It is also emblematic of the way sometimes coded language is used to keep new rentals out of mature neighbourhoods, while at the same time allowing for ever-larger or more expensive homes to replace existing, more modest housing stock.
"We're very disappointed," Mr. Galbraith said. "This is a good project; more people could be housed on this project than expressed opposition to it."
The proposal was designed entirely within the city's zoning for the area; it sought no variances or bylaw exceptions. All that it needed was permission to split the lot, a common occurrence in a city that has split thousands of lots in the past decade.
"We could get a permit to knock the house down today to build a fourplex," Mr. Galbraith said. "But we think that's an inefficient use of the land. It's on a streetcar line a block and a half west of Main [Street], near a subway station; near a GO train. This could be a showcase for what you can do in terms of ‘missing middle' in Toronto."
Mr. Galbraith said his clients may seek a review of the decision, which he argues was not properly decided, not least because "community interest" is not one of the 13 applicable tests in the Planning Act. But that adds tens of thousands of dollars in legal costs, not to mention delays.
The kicker, for Mr. Galbraith, is he knows if he wanted to sever the lot for two single-family homes he could get that permission without delay and likely also get permission to build more than local zoning allows.
"I can get variances for a oneunit McMansion every day of the week," he said. "Lot coverage variances are very common; you want to take a bungalow down and make some big ugly house with a weird roof and a high first floor? You see those all over East York and Etobicoke."
Close to two-thirds of Toronto's residential land is restricted to single-family homes, extending in a broad band surrounding the downtown core. The blame for this so-called "yellowbelt" - highly resistant to added density - is often laid at the feet of planners. But University of Toronto historian Richard White argues simply blaming planners lets the public and the politicians who represent them off the hook. Mr. White, who wrote a history of Toronto's boom years called Planning Toronto, says the current paralysis in the yellowbelt can be traced back to plans written in the 1960s in response to what some Torontonians felt was the overbuilding of rental in the 1950s.
"We have those restrictions because the people wanted them," Mr. White said. "The prewar areas of the city have become popular since the 1970s - it became a little bit cooler to live in the Annex or High Park - and it's attracted people that have money; influential upper middle class people - these well-informed doctors or lawyers - who get what they want.
"This idea that low density residential neighbourhoods are inviolate, now it's entrenched. As someone who has interviewed planners from the past, [I can say] the planners as individual people did not want that. Most of what happens in cities is not planned," he said.
The result is a city that has for decades had two modes: tall and sprawl. In areas where planning is loosened, pent-up demand creates thickets of new condominium towers (see King Street East and West, Eglinton Avenue and Yonge Street and Queen's Quay).
In low-rise areas, only a rare townhouse project or McMansion replaces older houses.
Mr. White and Mr. Galbraith both agree many of the postwar bungalow neighbourhoods in the city are ripe for redevelopment. The question is what form.
"These ideas have been floating around for decades of how to somehow or other increase the density of land use of these early suburbs," Mr. White said. The political desire to stop that trend results in rules such as Official Plan Amendment 320, which mandates new construction must match the "stable neighbourood character." Even though, as planners such as Cheryll Case have pointed out, there's nothing stable about gentrifying neighbourhoods, which not only see the swapping out of small houses for larger more expensive ones, but also often depopulation and a decrease in housing density.
Even when a plan like 2165 Gerrard St. E. fits inside restrictive rules, a stiff NIMBY wind seems to blow against it. "We are overprotecting the overprotected," Mr. Galbraith said. "Redevelopment happens ... does it happen in a way that's beneficial to the city? Why should some neighbourhoods adapt and evolve and others are allowed to remain exclusionary and keep people out?"

Pre-emptive bid for Bloor West home goes $276,000 over asking

Full text: DONE DEAL 467 Beresford Ave., Toronto BLOOR WEST VILLAGE Asking price: $1,099,000 Selling price: $1,375,000 Previous selling price: $776,500 (February, 2015) Taxes: $4,905 (2020) Days on the market: three Co-op agent: Mary Jo Vradis, Re/Max Hallmark Realty Ltd.
THE ACTION The buyers of this Bloor West home were already local residents, but wanted a larger house in the community.
They had made offers on three other properties but lost out to other bidders and were determined not to let this home slip from their grasp. Their pre-emptive offer for the semi-detached house on a 17-foot-by-97-foot lot was $276,000 over the asking price.
"People were under-listing like crazy and stuff was just going way over the asking price, so it was becoming increasingly difficult to find something in that location within their budget," agent Mary Jo Vradis said.
"We were the first ones to come to the table [to buy this home], but more people came, so it was a couple hours of back and forth."
WHAT THEY GOT This 1,230-squarefoot house underwent an extensive makeover in 2000 to improve high-traffic areas, including the eat-in kitchen, upper bathroom and lower-level recreation area with a second bathroom.
Pot lights were installed in the living room - which retains an original fireplace from 1912 - and hardwood floors were laid in all three bedrooms upstairs. The largest of them also has access to a front balcony.
THE AGENT'S TAKE "One of the key benefits of this property was it's on a street where you can park on both sides of the street, which is rare," Ms. Vradis said. "And it's accessible to transportation and walkable to amenities."
The house provides ample room to unwind.
"It had enough space for them to entertain, have storage and a nice backyard," Ms. Vradis said.
"In the middle of COVID, having more space at home makes sense."

Full text: 254 Bay St. S.
HAMILTON Asking price: $2.1-million Taxes: $13,823 (2020) Lot size: 66.99 feet by 128 feet Agent: Tom Fleming, broker, Judy Marsales Real Estate Ltd.
THE BACKSTORY Children of all ages have gotten to know "Bev's Castle," in Hamilton's west end. But the beloved Queen Anne Revival mini-mansion could soon belong to a new lord or lady.
For 16 years, Beverly BronteTinkew has lived in and run her speech and language pathology practice out of the sandstone and red brick house on the corner of Bay Street South and Charlton Avenue in the city's historic core.
It's notable to locals for its steep gabled roofs and enormous turret with wraparound porch. The Queen Anne style, popular in the late Victorian period, has been described as eccentric and flamboyant but its intricacies and flourishes have helped make Ms. Bronte-Tinkew's clients feel welcome and engaged. That is before 2020 changed everything.
"My clients are primarily kids - maybe with a diagnosis of autism or other communication disorder - anywhere from 18-20 months to young adults. I'm a singer as well, so there are also people who are professional voice users," Ms. Bronte-Tinkew said.
Over the years more and more of the house's six bedrooms have been turned over to the practice; one for group activities, one for music therapy, one to store the toys and other aids. It's been important for her to open her home to these young people to help them feel at ease and keep the setting as non-clinical as possible, even incorporating excursions to the courtyard garden and the local coffee shop into her sessions.
Her husband, artist and musician Michael Beerman, was a key part of the activities and the house was bustling morning, noon and night.
With the coming of COVID-19 suddenly the house was impractical for these sessions.
"Every doorknob is carved brass, and there's all the carved oak and glass; my little people like to explore things with tongues and mounts. I would not feel confident in keeping the coronavirus at bay and I don't want to restrict my little people or big people," Ms. Bronte-Tinkew said.
Masks, too, make it difficult to show people how to form words, and even sneeze guards tend to fog up. They installed a plexiglass shield in the massive coach house to keep some in-person sessions, but most have stopped or gone virtual.
And then.
"A month into the lockdown my husband died suddenly ... that was definitely the bigger blow. That changed my life," she said. And so, it's time for someone new to appreciate this house.
"It's a special place. I've been very lucky."
THE HOUSE TODAY There are three structures on this lot: the main house, which is more than 3,000 square feet, a 1,500-square-foot coach house and former stable and an attached but separated garden suite apartment that was the doctor's office of a previous owner. The coach house has two bedrooms, a kitchen, living room and fourpiece bathroom.
Ms. Bronte-Tinkew is only the fourth owner in the house's 125year history, according to listing agent Tom Fleming. The house was built by a lumber baron before the turn of the 20th century.
"It's in the Durand neighbourhood, and there's a certain cachet that goes along with it," Mr. Fleming said. "It's one of literally hundreds of houses of this standard that existed at that time; some were much grander and are gone.
A number of these enormous old grand mansions have been torn down, and replaced with low-rise rental apartments, and that's kind of the fabric of the neighbourhood now."
There are multiple entry points, but the formal entrance off the front porch opens into a wood-panelled vestibule bracketed by two double doors with crystal-cut glass. Past that is a generous main hallway that connects two front sitting rooms with the kitchen to the rear and a staircase that curves upstairs. Greeting visitors from a perch at the base of the balustrade is a brass statuette of Ponce de Leon, the Spanish explorer, triumphantly raising a torch to light the way. "It would have been gas, the little standard he's holding had a little key and the flame would have been at the top," Ms. Bronte-Tinkew said. It has since been rewired to join the electrical age.
The oak framing around the pocket doors has ornate flourishes, as does almost every piece of wood in the place. "It's like nothing else I've seen; to find something with this level of preservation, it's like walking into a living museum," Mr. Fleming said. "Everything is intact: the woodwork, door hardware, windows, crown mouldings, medallions, light fixtures, stained glass ... Hamilton history buffs contacted me: ‘Thank you for documenting this.' " Even the hardwood flooring is done in patterns quite a bit more elaborate than the vertical rows we're used to today.
"You feel enveloped by beauty.
That makes everything better; the worst days can still be positive," Ms. Bronte-Tinkew said.
To the left is a formal reception room. Tucked behind the stairs is a powder room and an office/library and to the right is a living room and connected dining room. The centrepiece of the living room is the massive carved wood and mirrored mantle around the tiled fireplace. Facing the street is the rounded interior wall of the house's turret, complete with curved, built-in seating. Then there are the more functional parts of the house; a butler's pantry almost entirely original (there's some newer granite) and beyond that a remodeled kitchen that is more country-modern than period Victorian. The kitchen was renovated by Mr. Beerman, down to the all-new maple flooring. At the back of the kitchen is the rear staircase, and off to the side is another modernized room - a mudroom with access to the rear courtyard and outbuildings.
On the second floor is the living quarters and workrooms.
There are five generous rooms, only one set up as a primary bedroom. All the doorways have glass-panelled dormer windows that open, offering lots of light even from the central hallway.
Some of these spaces could use decorative updating, but even as is it's a welcoming space. "There such warmth in the house, it felt warm and welcoming even though it's a mansion," Mr. Bronte-Tinkew said.
There's a more modest section on this level with former servants quarters, next to a bathroom, which has a separate water closet and shower room accessible from the hallway. The access to the vast and unfinished loft is here, too.
"It's got a crazy steep peaked roof for visual impact, and you could easily put a massive twostorey apartment up there in the huge attic," Mr. Fleming said.
The loft in the carriage house is similarly vast with its exposed timbers and light flooding in.
"[Bev] feels strongly that whoever buys the house should not significantly alter the property," Mr. Fleming said. "We're looking for someone who sees the inherent value in this preserved property - who will love it and become a steward - rather than someone who just sees dollar signs. We've had a lot of interest from that type of buyer."
The house has been a safe space for people learning to communicate; Ms. Bronte-Tinkew has been doing this work for more than 25 years in Hamilton. There are a lot of memories held inside this fanciful castle. "That's why I feel so important that somebody else loves the house to continue the legacy of caring and love," she said. "It's a bit of a project to take on, but it's very special."

Full text: I‘m sorry Di Rosa shoes, but you'll never make the cut. And that goes for No. 1 Sam's Hair Styling Place, Trecce, Local 1794, and quite a few others I spy from my vantage point across the street.
As nice as your century-old buildings are, and despite your recent listing on the City of Toronto's Heritage Register - along with my property and dozens of others on Danforth Avenue, a few on Dawes Road, and one each on Coxwell and Chisholm Avenues - your blank stucco faces, modern doors and windows, and general lack of anything heritage-worthy suggests you'll never move up a step to be designated.
Which means your owners will never have to worry should they decide to demolish you and erect a six-storey building in your place.
Nope, all they'll have to do is get a Heritage Impact Assessment (HIA) done and wait 60 days before swinging that ol' wrecking ball.
Then why have I seen so much concern on social media about these 165 properties being listed?
Why did a letter from the legal representative of the owner of Nos. 2928 and 2930 Danforth Ave., claim that listing "will make it more difficult to develop and improve them in the future and will deter investment" (as found on the City of Toronto website)? Why did the law firm Cassels blog that, while "the [Ontario Heritage] Act distinguishes between listed properties and designated properties, the impact on property owners may be the same"?
Fear of the unknown, I guess.
So, let's make it known.
With minimal staff, the City of Toronto is often forced to be reactive rather than pro-active when it comes to heritage properties; for instance, say a concerned community group alerts the city that 123 Main St. has been purchased by a developer. As the city sends a person to evaluate, 123's new owner applies for a demolition permit. Realizing that 123 is a perfect example of art deco architecture with many details intact, the city's preservation board scrambles to file an application to have the building designated, which then triggers a meeting where this item will get voted on, and concerned citizens for or against will have a chance to speak. But, in that time, Ms. Developer collects her permit and, sensing things might not go her way at the meeting, sends a crew to raze it to the ground ... which is perfectly legal.
While the above is fictional, I've watched it happen. In fact, at the end of November, one of two 192223 Frederic J.A. Davidson stone cottages on Superior Avenue in Toronto's Mimico neighbourhood was torn down just before that meeting. Modernism fans will remember a similar fate befell Isadore Sharp's Inn on the Park 14 years ago. So, one tool the city is now using to prevent playing catch-up is the batch-listing of properties, a method pioneered in the 1970s when the register began. In the case of the Danforth, the city reasons it's because the thoroughfare is a "largely intact early 20th-century streetscape, characterized by a predominantly main street building type - rows of two-storey brick storefront buildings articulated by intermittent three-storey block buildings" that were built "over a short period of time in the 1910s and 1920s."
Which makes it very pleasant to stroll, don't you think?
Batch-listing, architect and heritage advocate Catherine Nasmith writes in Built Heritage News, will "buy us some time to have a serious conversation about what is being lost in our current intensification process as it marches up and down our main streets like a drunken sailor, smashing everything in sight."
Think of it as Senate-like sober second-thought, but for buildings.
As the letter I received from the city states, listing "does not trigger maintenance requirements over and above existing property standards, and it does not restrict an owner's ability to make exterior and interior alternations."
If, however, I want to make massive changes, or demolish completely, then I must get that aforementioned HIA. And isn't it in the community's interest that I'm forced to do so? I mean, my building doesn't stand alone in a field - it's part of something bigger; as Ms. Nasmith writes, "how these properties work together is much more significant than the role of any single property."
With all of this in mind, I decided to take a walk and look at the properties beyond my windowperch. Which ones, I wondered, would cause my (somewhat) educated eye to pause?
I didn't find many. On a cold, windy Saturday morning I started at 699 Coxwell Ave., a handsome, buff brick, three-storey commercial building just north of the Danforth; this, I think, is a building that would likely raise a red flag.
Similarly, other corner buildings caught my eye, as architects usually add extra flourishes to gateway buildings: the Pizza Nova at Danforth and Woodmount Avenues for its corbels and little stone head on the roof (with 1926 underneath); the curved wall at the Coffee Time at Danforth and Cedarvale Avenues (which I remember was Dainty Miss Frocks when I was a boy); and the Hakim Optical at Main Street and Danforth (which still sports an etched The Home Bank of Canada on its upper façade).
Non-corner buildings I noted?
My building, at 1781, might catch the city's eye, but only because we've replaced lost Vitrolite on our façade (thanks to glass restoration specialist John Wilcox of Vitreous Glassworks); the old Woolworth's and Kresge's buildings at 2056 and 2064 Danforth; the amazing, almost untouched storefront at No. 2350; and the little art deco flourish on the top of 2742. These details, I think, would cause the city to look closer if an application for anything major was filed.
But, for the most part, as Ms. Nasmith points out, it's how the non-noteworthy, workaday buildings work together as a composition that's at play here. So, I think that, should an owner with a non-stuccoed façade apply to add a few storeys, he might be asked to set them back to show the original roofline. If a developer gathered three workaday properties to build a larger building, she might be asked to incorporate the original three façades (or, if the lot allows, retain the entire buildings), just like what's been happening on Yonge Street. And that's it.
It's about not clear cutting, Ms. Nasmith says: "Main streets are like old growth forests, they display species diversity, they support a rich variety of interdependent activities, the mature die off and are replaced by new a little at a time leaving the forest whole."
Unfortunately, too many of us can't see the forest for the trees.
In all, the City of Toronto is proposing the listing of 963 properties. Others are on Roncesvalles Avenue, Dundas Street West, Queen Street East and West., King Street East, Ossington Avenue, and many others. A full list can be found here: shorturl.at/nAEK5

Full text: A major Canadian developer is betting on the future of downtown Toronto, both the residential and office markets, with a new development proposal that's the biggest in the city since the onset of COVID-19.
Dream Office REIT submitted an application this week to build a 310-metre office and residential complex at 212 King St. W., on the edge of the financial district. The tower would be among the tallest buildings in the city.
Designed by SHoP Architects of New York, the 79-storey tower would include 660,000 square feet of office space and 588 residential rental units. The base would include 10,000 square feet of retail and restaurant space in portions of three heritage-protected loft buildings.
The owner of one building, privately held Humbold Properties, is partnering with Dream on the project.
The project emerges amid a pandemic that has led to an economic downturn and caused many in office jobs to work from home. The office vacancy rate in downtown Toronto has more than doubled to 4.7 per cent and a number of major companies are trying to sublease their space. Condo resale prices in downtown Toronto have also dropped as local demand has softened.
But Dream chief executive Michael Cooper is confident that Toronto's core will rebound and remain attractive as a place to live and work after the pandemic.
"Downtown Toronto is exciting and vibrant," he said. "That's been true in the past, and it's still true now."
The real estate investment trust's assets are already heavily concentrated in downtown Toronto.
Through its publicly traded Dream Impact Trust, Dream also has an interest in the Mirvish+Gehry development, which would be located on the same block of King Street West. That two-tower complex, approved by the city at heights up to 305 metres, "is actively moving forward" and should come to market in 2021, Mr. Cooper said.
Mr. Cooper said working from home will become a standard practice after the pandemic, but argued it is unclear how this will ultimately affect demand for office space.
"Employers and employees want to be in the best office space available," he said. "People want to be in great environments; there will be flight to the interesting buildings in locations like this."
The proposed building is to include a multistorey lobby for the offices, bordered by retail; a restaurant on the seventh floor would sit atop the retained portions of the heritage buildings.
Above that would be wide office floors, and then narrower residential floors capping the building.
The tower, if approved at its proposed height, would be among the tallest buildings in the city and the country. It would be 13 metres taller than First Canadian Place, long the tallest office tower in Toronto, and 11 metres taller than QuadReal Property Group's recently approved Commerce Court 3, also in Toronto's core.
Joe Cressy, the Toronto city councillor who represents the area, said the proposal will need to align with the city's urban design and heritage policies, but it generally matches the city's aspirations for a denser mixed-use neighbourhood. "We are expressly aiming to continue growth here, with commercial and office as important parts of downtown," he said.
The project will now begin an approvals process with the City of Toronto. A spokesperson said public consultation meetings will begin early in 2021. Construction could begin in 2022.
SHoP, the lead architects, is no stranger to heights - in New York it is building two supertall towers that accommodate heritage elements as well. Gregg Pasquarelli, a partner at SHoP, said the Toronto project's mix of residential, office and commercial uses represents a progressive approach to development. "Sophisticated cities are learning that a mixed-use building creates a more vibrant neighbourhood," he said. "Different uses keep the block vibrant 24 hours a day."
Mr. Pasquarelli explained that the design of the tower is broken up visually into two sections. The first, wider section would contain the office floors and be faced partly with white terracotta panels; the taller, narrower section, with predominantly black cladding, contains apartments. He said details of the architecture, including the textured ceiling of the atrium, would be inspired by the existing buildings, which once housed a factory where General Electric's Canadian unit made turbines and motors.
Mr. Pasquarelli said arguments about COVID-19 and "the death of the city" are overstated. "After 9/11, a lot of people said that no one in New York City would ever want to rent in a tall building again," he said. "Now we have 10 buildings taller than the Empire State Building. What makes cities great is not going away."

Full text: Thousands began streaming in at all hours when British Columbia got its first taste of Vegas-style gambling in June, 2004, in the opening days of the River Rock Casino Resort, located on the industrial outskirts of the Vancouver suburb of Richmond.
Among the crowds, organized criminals were exchanging elastic-wrapped bricks of $20 bills - the lingua franca of the province's sizable drug trade - for chips and then cashing out for bigger bills that were much easier to spend on legal goods and services. Wealthy tourists from China came in droves, some converting the same bricks of cash packaged the same way. Soon, reports of gamblers getting robbed or kidnapped near the glitzy new casino also began trickling in to the local police.
Two months after the opening, a new provincial RCMP unit to investigate a long list of gambling-related crimes went live.
The integrated team, mostly funded by the provincial gambling regulator, was formed "to ensure the integrity of legalized gaming" as B.C. ramped up the licensing and promotion of casinos. This unit was mandated to bust up the casinos' illegal competition - unlicensed slot machine vendors, underground poker dens and bingo halls - as well as crack down on criminals that were loan sharking and money laundering in and around legal venues.
But the unit was disbanded by 2009, weakening casino oversight in a region that later became infamous for the "Vancouver model" of money laundering - a term created by an Australian professor that refers to a dynamic in which an underground banking system spirits money out of China into Metro Vancouver to be mixed with local and transnational drug money and then filtered through the gambling and real estate sectors.
The death knell of that group, which was overseen by a special board of top Mounties and provincial gambling officials, was seized upon by critics as a major low point in the province's fight against money laundering. But many other government and police actions from that era have raised questions about why oversight remained weak as money laundering and its constellation of crimes kept growing.
During three recent weeks of testimony, B.C.'s public inquiry into money laundering heard from former RCMP investigators and their superiors, the special constables working at a provincial agency that once partnered with the disbanded unit, B.C.'s gambling regulator and former casino employees. And many lawyers were also given time to cross-examine these witnesses to represent the interests of some of the two dozen parties granted standing, including one of the biggest gambling operators and a former provincial attorney-general who allegedly told one of the commission witnesses that the massive tax revenues prompted his government of the day to turn a blind eye to organized crime.
The group of witnesses illustrated how a patchwork of competing organizations left a decade of enforcement gaps that were big enough to drive millions of dirty dollars through. Their testimony, outlined in transcripts covering 15 days, shows the often earnest pursuit of these criminals by Mounties, provincial gambling investigators and casino staff was hamstrung by a lack of resources and the discord between the half dozen groups tasked with stopping the crimes.
‘THE MONSTER IS GROWING' Tom Robertson commanded the RCMP's illegal gambling squad for its first year of operation, although neither he nor any of the 10 Mounties he started the unit with had any experience tackling sophisticated money laundering or proceeds of crime investigations. He envisioned his new team would begin tackling smaller, quicker cases involving weekly underground Texas Hold'em tournaments or coffee shops with illegal video gambling terminals. That way, he reasoned, his group would soon develop the skills needed to investigate more complicated cases while proving to his RCMP bosses and the board overseeing his unit that they were making a dent in the province's illegal gambling problem.
But five months into investigating the underground operators, Mr. Robertson's new unit was asked by Richmond RCMP to solve a case at the River Rock after a security guard there reported a loan shark operating within the casino. His unit interviewed suspects and eventually got the target of the probe to forfeit a large sum of money, but criminal charges were never secured.
By stepping into the casino, the investigators also raised the hackles of the gambling conglomerate Great Canadian Gaming Corp., as well as the Gaming Policy Enforcement Branch - the provincial agency tasked with cracking down on more minor offences at licensed gambling venues, Mr. Robertson testified.
"My decision appears to have possibly ruffled some feathers with the representative of Great Canadian Casinos and does not have the full agreement" of the director of GPEB, Mr. Robertson wrote Feb. 24, 2005, in an e-mail to his boss about the case.
The squabble with GPEB over whether the RCMP unit could send officers into the province's casinos was never resolved, Mr. Robertson testified in front of the commission last month. His nascent unit never got further guidance on its true purpose from RCMP brass, lawmakers or its special board, which included representatives from the BC Lottery Corp. It was disbanded in 2009, with the provincial minister in charge of gambling at the time saying it had become inefficient and redundant and that existing police agencies could handle the issue.
As Mr. Robertson was trying to train his officers, the Richmond RCMP detachment and its commander, Superintendent Ward Clapham, were blindsided by a crime wave at the River Rock.
Mr. Clapham, the Mountie in charge of the detachment for six years leading up to his retirement from the force in 2008, had previously given city council his support for the casino, although he expected it to bring minor crime. If things got out of control at River Rock, Mr. Clapham figured he could get more funding for more officers from the new gambling revenues.
"Well, by 2005, I don't think anyone could have predicted what we started to see," he testified on Oct. 27, pointing out two kidnapping cases uncovered concerning links to widespread loan sharking at the casino.
Six months after the casino opened, he e-mailed his boss, Al Macintyre, the Mountie in charge of the Lower Mainland district.
"I need 5 mins of your time to talk to you regarding Great Canadian Casino. I am worried - the monster is growing. Their influence will soon control BC Gaming."
Mr. Clapham told the commission he was worried the company was set to expand with other casinos and he wanted to raise concerns about the rise in gamblingrelated crime he had seen in Richmond. He tried to scramble foot patrols to the casino to provide a uniformed deterrent to loan sharks and other criminals. Even though staffing shortages meant that only happened about once a week, he soon had an executive from the casino company call him complaining about the RCMP presence.
"I was told that it was bad for business to have uniform police officers walking inside of the casino," Mr. Clapham testified.
He diplomatically told the casino representative that these foot patrols would continue, and, to lead by example, he and two inspectors started periodically touring the floor and talking to patrons. Before he retired, his superiors did not approve two proposals to form a special unit within his detachment to investigate organized crime groups that were loan sharking, extorting, kidnapping and assaulting gamblers at the casino.
THE VIEW FROM INSIDE It wasn't news to staff at the River Rock that there were an increasing number of loan sharks operating within their facility. Security cameras had caught them hanging around, not playing much and quietly passing chips to gamblers. The commission heard that BC Lottery Corp. investigators assigned to the casino banned en masse the most infamous loan sharks after a few months with the help of casino staff, but problems persisted.
Part of the challenge, the commission heard from witnesses, was the loan sharks simply handed off cash to patrons in the parking lot or at the adjoining hotel.
As the province raised the amount of money gamblers could lay down each round of betting at table games, loan sharks upped the amount they would dole out, testified Stone Lee, a former casino surveillance employee who later joined the provincial gambling regulator. In 2012, "it was not out of the ordinary to see two to three cash buy-ins of $300,000 or $400,000 per night," he wrote in a commission affidavit.
"[For example], someone loses their bankroll, they appear to run out of their money, and they will make a phone call or follow somebody out or leave the casino shortly after and come back with another bag of cash to buy in," he testified.
Mr. Lee noted that Paul King Jin constantly appeared in the background of many a sketchy transaction.
Mr. Jin, who was recently given partial standing at the commission to rebut allegations about his alleged crimes, was temporarily banned from casinos twice by the BCLC before being handed a five-year ban in 2012. Then Mr. Jin simply moved his sizable operation to the parking lot, said Mr. Lee, who often interviewed heavy gamblers who had no idea they were being lent money by someone with alleged ties to organized crime.
Ken Ackles, an investigator with GPEB, testified that in 2015, his boss at the provincial agency finally understood the scope of the problem when he presented him with a spreadsheet. The data showed suspicious transactions at River Rock that month were "over $20-million in cash, of which I believe there was $14,856,000 roughly in $20 bills."
"I received a phone call from him that evening after I had given him the spreadsheets, and he conveyed to me at the time that he was shocked. He thought I was joking," he testified.
The commission has now heard from expert witnesses on how dirty money mingles with the real estate sector, cryptocurrency and the legal profession. More experts from a host of other industries will testify into the new year in advance of a final report being submitted to government in the spring.

Full text: Each spring, near a south Florida seaside strip known as the Broadwalk, the grateful retailers and restaurateurs of Hollywood Beach gather for a two-day celebration of all things Canada.
"Canadafest" has played out for nearly 40 years in the heart of a uniquely Canadian diaspora south of Fort Lauderdale, a way of saying thank you to the roughly 1.2 million people from north of the border who visit the state annually.
The 2021 Canadafest was to be the biggest ever, said Denise Dumont, the editor-in-chief of Le Soleil de la Floride, the French-language community newspaper that helps organize the event.
COVID-19, of course, had other plans. "The 2021 edition has been cancelled, for obvious reasons," Ms. Dumont said. "We hope that later on, we're going to be able to continue the tradition."
It's just one illustration of the looming "dark winter" the pandemic has wrought in the United States, where the number of single-day deaths and new infections have blown past earlier peaks established in the spring.
And in a part of the country that has come to embrace Canada's seasonal visitors as family, the health risks and cross-border travel restrictions are sure to amplify the pain.
"It's going to be a tough, tough season," said Dan Serafini, a veteran Hollywood restaurateur who has been a fixture in the area since migrating from Sudbury with his wife, Lise-Anne, in 1984.
The Serafinis, whose first restaurant became the original East Side Mario's, have operated GG's Waterfront Bar and Grill in Hollywood for a decade. Their latest venture, a casual eatery they've rechristened Tiki Tiki, is run by their son, Alex.
Receipts for November are already trending about 30 per cent lower than previous years, Mr. Serafini said - a figure that reflects both a decline in Canadian traffic and a modest increase in the number of visiting Americans. In a typical year, roughly 500,000 Canadians - many of them from Quebec - spend the winter in Florida, said Evan Rachkovsky, a spokesman for the Canadian Snowbird Association. Many gravitate to Hollywood, and have done since the 1920s, when labourers from Canada helped founder Joseph Young build the city from scratch.
Their ranks are expected to plunge 70 per cent this season, Mr. Rachkovsky said, to say nothing of the likely impact on short-term visits. Together, snowbirds and short-termers typically spend more than US$6-billion ($7.6-billion) in the state each year.
"I'll tell you, we love those Canadians," Mr. Serafini said.
"When they come, they spend, and they really help the local economy here. And they're entrenched in this community - they've been here for years and years, have settled here to some degree, and this is their home away from home."
Not this year.
Debra Case, who has owned and operated the Ocean Alley Restaurant and Beach Bar with husband Terry for the past 20 years, said business is down by half compared with 2019, despite a very strong first three months of the year.
In March, when the pandemic first hit, "everybody just left, and they haven't come back," Ms. Case said.
"Even though we are allowed 50 per cent seating in our businesses, still today, we have nearly zero Canadian traffic. So you can imagine how that has impacted us."
Florida has the third-highest total COVID-19 caseload of all 50 U.S. states - more than a million as of Friday morning - and added nearly 11,000 new cases Thursday. Visit Florida, the state's official tourism marketing agency, said preliminary figures show a 98.8per-cent decline in Canadian visits during July, August and September compared with the same period a year ago.
And it's not just Hollywood: Florida-bound snowbirds and tourists also tend to flock to the Gulf Coast beaches in the Tampa area. "You can definitely tell that the Canadians aren't here like they'd normally be - and travellers in general, for that matter," said Joseph Guggino, an attorney and real estate investor whose latest venture, Forbici Modern Italian, opened there in 2019.

Full text: Nancy-Marie Bélanger and Hugo Didier, a young couple living in Montreal's trendy Rosemont-La Petite-Patrie borough, jumped at the chance to build their dream home when a commercial garage on a nearby lot went up for sale four years ago.
Once the old auto-repair shop was knocked down and the soil decontaminated, the way was clear to transform into reality their vision of the ideal domestic haven.
They entered into a close creative collaboration with Montreal architect and friend Jean Verville, adopting a playful, exploratory approach, with frequent brainstorming sessions over how to create the abode of true contentment and serenity.
"I wouldn't have done it with anyone but him," said Ms. Bélanger, an interior designer who at one time worked in Mr. Verville's studio.
"It was a process where we had to let go, asking questions about how we wanted to live," Mr. Didier said, a ceramic artist. "Our goal was to re-examine what it is that we need and don't need."
The result is an idiosyncratic building that - in the words of Mr. Verville, who is also a professor at Laval University - "offers spatial investigations reshaping the typology of the Montreal triplex."
Compactness, intimacy, efficient use of space, lots of natural light and a notable lack of clutter or ornamentation are the keynotes. Rather than opting for the standard three apartments stacked horizontally on top of the other over three storeys, the plan was to go vertical.
The 1,550-square-foot family residence where the couple and their three-year-old son Jules live distributes the living quarters - as well as Mr. Didier's pottery studio - over four levels. A white, metal staircase similar to Montreal's ubiquitous outdoor backstairs connects the floors.
Natural light floods in through the generous fenestration and rooftop skylights. One of the skylights pops open to provide access to the rooftop garden. All of this happens at the back of the white-brick and brass-trim building, with its striking array of asymmetrically placed windows of various dimensions.
The front half is occupied by two rental units: a two-bedroom with a terrace garden, over three storeys; and a one-bedroom studio apartment on two levels.
The entrance to the family unit is actually at the front; a long corridor leads to an open kitchen/ dining-room space highlighted by a large set of four adjacent framed windows looking out onto the backyard. There is starkness and simplicity of design - a rough-edged quality - in the mix of polished concrete floor, white walls and glued-laminated industrial timber ceiling joists.
But the space radiates a feeling of warmth nonetheless. As for the actual source of warmth: The 21/2-inch-thick concrete floors throughout the home are electrically heated.
The kitchen is a low-key departure from the usual sleek, lavishly appointed showcase so often de rigueur in designer homes. Solid maple countertops are fitted over open, workshop-style storage space and drawers. There has been no effort to dissimulate the plumbing beneath the sink. In the corner is a small cruciform window.
Elsewhere in the house, another example of exposed HVAC and plumbing components: ventilation ducts that are in full view between ceiling joists. The water pipes beneath the washbasins - handmade by Mr. Didier - in the bathroom and washrooms are also exposed.
Up one floor are the living room and a home office/guest room. The bedrooms, on the top floor, are tiny; Jules's room offers just enough clearance to allow for walking around the bed.
The bathroom was split into three separate enclosures: a bath/shower room, a toilet and a washroom/vanity.
As for closet space, there is just one large walk-in for the entire family that also serves as the laundry room, with a washer/ dryer unit at the far end.
Mr. Verville says one inspiration for the design of the house is the Japanese philosophy of wabisabi, with its emphasis on the merits of the ordinary, the unfinished, the imperfect.
"We wanted to prioritize spatial quality rather than decoration," he said. "It's a highlighting of the ordinary."
A standout feature is the quirky placement and variety in shape and size of the windows.
"We made a list of all the different types and shapes of windows on the street and put a bit of all of them in the house," Mr. Didier said. As a general rule, smaller windows were matched with the bedrooms and the larger fenestration was reserved for the larger rooms.
Ms. Bélanger says a key objective while pulling together the main elements of the project was ensuring the rental units got the same treatment as the main residence. No skimping by using Formica countertops or cheaper flooring.
"We met with five different contractors. The reaction among some of them was to not put in a heated floor or all-wood kitchen.
We didn't listen," she said.
The couple were also careful to make sure the bedrooms in the rental units were placed such that their occupants didn't have the tenant in the other apartment walking over their heads.
Another important aspect: sourcing, as much as possible, from local crafts people and producers. The energy-efficient windows, for example, are by Terrebonne, Que.-based Fabelta, while the wood countertop and storage units in the kitchen are by Ébénisterie CST Enr. of Montreal.
The couple did a lot of the interior finishing on their own.
The architect and his two partner clients are more than pleased with the final, quirky result of their efforts. And the process that took them there.
"Everybody feels more implicated within the context of a playful approach," Mr. Verville said.
"This sense of participating in a game frees up a certain naiveté and leads to stimulating exchanges." Being open and receptive to unconventional ideas, making room for the unpredictable, were central to the project's success, he said.

Full text: 125 Sorauren Ave.
TORONTO Asking Price: $3,299,000 Taxes: $10,200 (2020) Lot Size: 25.3 feet by 100 feet Agent: Alex Brott, Sage Real Estate Ltd.
THE BACKSTORY The property at 125 Sorauren Ave. in Toronto's Parkdale neighbourhood had boarded-up windows and paving in place of a front garden when Mary-Beth Jenner first saw it in 2016.
"You could barely see the ‘for sale' sign in the window," she says.
Ms. Jenner doesn't know the original purpose of the dwelling, which is about 100 years old, but she says it's one in a row of similar brick buildings on the street. Some of them originally served as local shops in the residential area, she says.
Today, the buildings are extremely flexible, she says, pointing to neighbouring structures that have been converted into a combination of flats, restaurants and cafés.
One has found new life as a yoga studio.
When she entered No. 125, the various levels were rundown, she says.
"They were so neglected and falling apart, but they all had such nice high ceilings."
Ms. Jenner is a former film producer who turned her love of design into a new career doing residential design and landscaping.
She could see potential in the property and its pleasant backyard.
She enjoys the area north of Queen Street West, near Roncesvalles Avenue, and she liked the position of the property across the street from a neighbourhood landmark: the Annunciation of the Virgin Mary Greek Orthodox Cathedral.
She purchased the property and began a lengthy renovation.
THE HOUSE TODAY Ms. Jenner spent more than one year transforming the building into three apartments divided over 2,541 square feet of above-ground living space. An additional 851 square feet of space in the basement contains a fourth apartment.
Tearing the structure apart revealed all sorts of problems along the way, she says, including roof joists in such bad shape that they needed to be replaced.
"There were always surprises with these old homes," she says.
Ms. Jenner added new insulation and soundproofing to make each unit comfortable and quiet. The electrical systems were updated and fire separation was added.
Each unit has front and rear exits and stairs, a kitchen and a bathroom.
The main floor and second floor both have two bedrooms and a living room as well. The third floor has one bedroom and a living room.
"Everyone got a private outdoor space and a private entry," she says.
Inside, Ms. Jenner opened up the units to take advantage of the high ceilings and light. "Then the apartments really started to sing."
At one time, Ms. Jenner thought she and her partner would eventually move into the home and use the top floor as a live/ work space. Under that scenario, the third floor would become two offices with a kitchenette between them.
The layout is very flexible, she says, with the possibility of combining two units into one, using one as an owner's suite, or turning the entire building into a single-family home.
"It would make a beautiful big, house."
The renovation of the lower level included lowering the floor and fixing the foundation, she explains.
The exterior, meanwhile, was refurbished with a frieze with dental moulding on the front façade. A private garden in the rear is shared space.
Ms. Jenner furnished each of the units so tenants can just move in. She says the basement has a long-term tenant and the upper three units are often rented by visiting professionals and creative types who are in Toronto for a stretch of time working on a project.
Sometimes families who live in the neighbourhood rent a unit while their own house is undergoing renovations.
The neighbourhood provides quick access to parks, schools and restaurants, she points out. Sorauren Avenue Park has a weekly farmer's market.
"You wouldn't have to touch your car if you didn't want to."
THE BEST FEATURE
The third-floor bedroom has a wall of French doors opening to a terrace. Tenants have views of the dome of the notable cathedral across the street.

Full text: The work-from-home trend continues to increase property sales and prices outside the core areas of Toronto and Vancouver, while depressing downtown condo prices as buyers seek bigger spaces.
Home sales hit 8,766 in the Toronto region in November, an increase of 24 per cent over the same month last year, with strong sales in all types of houses and townhouses offsetting weakness in the condo market, according to the local real estate board.
Condos within the city of Toronto were the only type of property to record flat sales and lose value in the region, as new condo listings nearly doubled over the year, according to the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board.
The average selling price of a condo fell 3 per cent to $640,208 compared with November of last year, said a report by the Toronto board. In comparison, sales of detached and semi-detached houses, as well as townhouses, increased from 19 per cent to more than 30 per cent in the Greater Toronto Area. Detached house prices rose 19 per cent in the suburbs and 9 per cent in the city.
Across the Toronto region, the average selling price hit $955,615 in November, an incremental decline from October and a 13per-cent gain over November of last year.
The home price index, which corrects distortions caused by expensive transactions, was up 11 per cent to $902,500 over the year.
Greater inflation occurred in the areas surrounding the city. To the west in Halton Region, the index was up 13.5 per cent. To the east in Durham Region, the index was up 20 per cent. To the north in Simcoe County, the index was up 22.7 per cent. In contrast, in the city of Toronto, the index was up 6 per cent.
The same trend is taking place in the Vancouver region. Home sales reached their highest level in five years, with house sales surpassing downtown condos as buyers sought bigger, cheaper spaces to accommodate home offices and work-fromhome plans. Home sales in the Vancouver region reached 3,064 last month, a 23-percent increase over November, 2019, with semi-detached houses recording a 40-percent jump, followed by detached houses and condos, according to the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver.
Prices were higher for every type of property compared with November, 2019, but condos recorded the smallest gain. The home price index rose 9 per cent for detached houses in the Vancouver region.
The index was 5.6 per cent higher for townhouses and 3 per cent higher for condos, according to a Vancouver board report.
"It's all about space right now," said Vancouver board chair Colette Gerber. "Now that people have a better sense of what their work environment is going to be like and how much time they will be able to spend at home, they are definitely moving further out and living in more open air," she said.
Since the pandemic started, homebuyers have gravitated toward detached and semi-detached houses, the suburbs and areas outside major employment centres of Vancouver and Burnaby in British Columbia and the city of Toronto. In vacation areas such as the Sunshine Coast and Gulf Islands in B.C., approximately 40 per cent of the buyers bought properties as secondary, recreational homes before the pandemic. Now, about 80 per cent of the purchases are for primary residences, according to Ms. Gerber.
The price index across all types of homes was up 20 per cent on Bowen Island, up 17.5 per cent on the Sunshine Coast and up 8.8 per cent in Squamish, the board said.
In Toronto, although condos have taken a hit in the city, the real estate board and other realtors believe that the market will rebound when the pandemic subsides and the economy reopens once again. "That will lead to an increase in demand for condominium apartments," the Toronto board's chief market analyst Jason Mercer said in a statement.
Over all, new listings in both regions were up by about a third compared with the previous November.

Real estate trends to watch in 2021

Full text: The story of Canada's commercial real estate in 2021 will depend on how many COVID-19 plot twists have caused permanent changes in leasing and transaction patterns.
Industrial and retail real estate trends that had already emerged in 2019 were greatly accelerated by the pandemic, say industry professionals. Warehousing and distribution centre construction and lease rates, already on the upswing, took off as e-commerce increased. Bricks-and-mortar retail has been hit harder as some retail chains founder and mall tenants struggle to make their rents during lockdowns.
The office sector has been thrown into disarray and forecasts are divided on where office vacancies and trends are heading.
"One camp is predicting workfrom-home could become the new norm and the other is saying we will return to how things were previously," says Matt Picken, Jones Lang LaSalle Inc.'s (JLL) national lead of capital markets.
"I think there will be a compromise. Clearly there's some costsaving involved in work-fromhome but to the detriment of collaboration and office culture."
JLL's third-quarter 2020 office report showed a total office vacancy rate in Canada of 10.8 per cent and the "largest negative quarterly net absorption in over a decade, totaling nearly 2.7 million square feet of occupancy losses."
But Mr. Picken remains confident in an office rebound once a vaccine is in place. "It's too early to write off the office market. Our vacancies were so low for such a long time, this is not necessarily such a bad thing."
Scott Addison, president of brokerage services Canada for Colliers, says available space, including lease and sublease vacancies, in major downtown markets could increase to more than 10 per cent in the next 18 months.
"The amount of sublease space coming to market is dramatic - 350 per cent more sublease space came to market in the last quarter than last year at this time."
Mr. Addison says companies may have taken more space than they needed, based on big growth projections, and firms with multiple locations may be consolidating as leases come up.
According to Ray Wong, vicepresident of data operations at Data Solutions for Altus Group, there are discussions between office landlords and tenants about downsizing, renegotiating rents and even increasing space requirements to accommodate physical distancing.
"On top of that, we're seeing increased inquiries into the suburban markets, closer to where people live."
Mr. Wong adds that some companies are looking into relocating further out of the big cities to markets such as Kelowna, B.C., Kitchener-Waterloo, Ont., and Halifax to get more bang for the buck.
That drive to lower density locations might help Calgary, says Greg Kwong, regional managing director in Calgary for CBRE.
The office vacancy rate in downtown Calgary in third-quarter 2020 was 28.7 per cent, according to CBRE statistics. Mr. Kwong says the continuing crisis in the energy sector plays as big a role in Alberta as does COVID-19.
Vancouver is not experiencing the office vacancy woes felt elsewhere to the same extent, according to CBRE's Vancouver managing director Jason Kiselbach.
"We entered 2020 with one of the lowest vacancies and we still have that," he said, adding that a diversity of business, including film production and health sciences, as well as constrained office supply has contributed to a favourable climate.
Industrial properties, particularly warehouse and distribution, are bright spots for all markets in Canada. A trend to low vacancies and increasing lease rates was boosted significantly in 2020 by COVID-19's influence on the rise of online shopping. Experts say the trend will continue through 2021 with still more construction and higher rates.
Mr. Wong says he would tell investors that their most promising bet for 2021 would be industrial land with room for possible expansion on a major arterial road.
There is little available space in the market, he says. Third-quarter 2020 figures show national availability at 3.1 per cent, with Toronto figures at 1.9 per cent and Vancouver at 2.3.
In Vancouver, where available land is at a premium, industrial is beginning to go multistorey. Oxford Properties Group's Riverbend Business Park is the first multistorey facility of its type in the Vancouver area.
Frank Magliocco, real estate leader with PwC Canada, says there is also a trend to some "reshoring" of manufacture because COVID-19 revealed the disruptions that can happen to global supply chains because of a pandemic.
"That's also driving wind under the sales of industrial."
Malls and power centres are another uncertain sector of industry. Some observers are seeing excess retail land being converted to residential and industrial uses.
"There is potential to convert some non-performing shopping centres to last-mile fulfilment centres," JLL's Mr. Picken says.
"The numbers are going to start to break in favour of this type of development because there's such a shortage of warehouse space in key urban areas."
Mr. Addison predicts that big regional malls and local corner stores will return post-COVID-19, but consumers may still choose e-commerce over a trip to a power centre.
"Because of the pandemic, those who weren't using e-commerce are finding ‘this is easy, it's pretty good.' " Mr. Addison says.
"In February, it's snowing, you're in Calgary. Are you going to drive out to a power centre or are you just going to order it off Amazon and have it delivered that afternoon?"

Full text: In September, with few tenants on site because of the COVID-19 pandemic, work began on a multimillion-dollar retrofit of a 20-storey office building in downtown Toronto.
A new heating, cooling and ventilation system at 11 King St. W., replacing one installed 60 years ago, incorporates state-ofthe-art technology to enhance air quality.
As well, the two-year modernization by property management company Triovest Realty Advisors Inc. will cut energy use and greenhouse gas emissions and meet sustainability standards of the Canada Green Building Council.
The project is one example of an industry-wide strategy to press ahead with sustainability investments in commercial real estate despite pandemic-induced economic setbacks.
"The sustainability effort continues full steam ahead," says Frank Magliocco, national real estate leader for consultants PwC Canada, which reports a "growing focus on environmental, social and governance factors" by commercial real estate investors and operators. "That [attention to sustainability] is critical for the long-term value of their investment and they are not going to back off on that," he says.
Last May, the Green Building Council warned the federal government that energy efficiency and low-carbon upgrades to existing buildings "are not happening at the depth or pace necessary" to meet Canada's 2030 emission reduction targets.
"The commercial real estate industry recognizes that [climate change] is a threat and we need to have urgent action in addressing it," says council president Thomas Mueller, who sees "undiminished" industry interest in sustainability.
Some companies, including Triovest, took advantage of reduced occupancies to carry out retrofits during the daytime.
"The sustainability-related initiatives continued and in some cases expanded, even with the additional work imposed on building owners and managers by COVID," says Philippe Bernier, vice-president of innovation and sustainability at Triovest.
In some cases, health and safety measures heightened interest in sustainability.
"Cleaning has a hygiene aspect and a sustainability footprint," says Ben Shinewald, president and chief executive officer of BOMA Canada, whose "BOMA BEST" certification for energy and environmental management and performance grew to 3,300 participants this year.
Easing up is not an option, he says. "This is not a luxury; it is an imperative," he says.
"Companies simply have to be sustainable to be competitive."
Recently, several Canadian real estate companies supported the United Statesbased non-profit Center for Active Design, which operates the Fitwel certification program for healthy buildings, in developing a "viral response module" that validates best practices in limiting the spread of contagious diseases.
The module, rolled out in September, puts a premium on quality cleaning protocols and ventilation systems that boost indoor air quality, often with high-end filters that capture fine particulate matter.
But the high-performing filters sometimes force a ventilation system to work harder, increasing energy use, a conflict that concerns industry officials.
"As a sector, we are trying to figure that out now," says Steven Pacifico, director of sustainability and innovation for Epic Investment Services, which owns and manages properties across North America.
"While operating buildings with these higher performance measures for air quality, we are also thinking about how we are going to meet our energy and carbon reduction goals," he adds. "That is the complexity we are dealing with, and I will be honest, we don't have all the answers yet."
Still, Mr. Pacifico and many others credit the pandemic with shining a light on sustainability practices that benefit tenants.
"The pandemic helped us say, ‘Let's not use energy or utilities that we don't need to use' and save costs for tenants and clients," he says. "It allowed us to take time to ensure that our systems are performing at optimal peak performance, which helps create more energy efficiency."
Increasingly, companies invest in "smart" technology, such as automatic doors and occupancy sensors that identify the location and number of people in a building.
"In that case, we can review the cost of operating the building if it is not at full capacity," says Mehrnoosh Ebrahimzadeh, manager, national sustainability and energy at Colliers International Real Estate Management Services.
"It has made everyone aware of the importance of sustainability over all," she says. "They are more conscious of the environment now."
Some firms now set targets for energy and water consumption and, increasingly, enroll in "green" certification programs.
In 2017, Manulife Investment Management announced a five-year target for its global real estate portfolio to use 10 per cent less energy, 7.5 per cent less water and divert 65 per cent of waste from landfill.
The company sets expectations for local property managers and conducts an internal audit twice a year to monitor performance, says Regan Smith, MIM's assistant vice-president and managing director of real estate sustainability.
With sustainability already embedded in management practices, she says COVID-19 only serves as "an accelerator." The response to climate change and COVID-19, she argues, requires a commitment to science and positive tactics, not fear, to engage tenants and the public.
Two years ago, her company collaborated with a non-profit to manage urban gardens on the rooftops of half a dozen MIMmanaged offices in Montreal and renewed the project despite the pandemic. This summer's harvest yielded 1,800 pounds of fresh fruits, herbs and vegetables.
Ms. Smith sees no reason to slow down on sustainability because of a disruptive pandemic.
"We stayed the course because we, as global managers and owners of assets, have a long-term view and we need to take a long-term view on sustainability as well."

Full text: Home prices have spiked in resort towns, cottage country and tourist areas across most of Canada, as the pandemic's workfrom-home trend pushes buyers to escape the city for nature and more space.
In Ontario's recreational markets, which include Muskoka north of Toronto and Land O' Lakes to the east, the aggregate price of a detached house jumped 20 per cent to $450,127 in first nine months of the year over the same period in 2019, according to a report from Royal LePage.
Buyers looking for properties where they could work remotely and use as their primary residence drove up prices. The steepest increases were found in Gravenhurst, where the aggregate price rose 44.5 per cent; in Haliburton Highlands, the region bordering the southern part of Algonquin Park, where the price shot up 28.6 per cent; and in Rideau Lake, south of Ottawa, where the price rose 25 per cent.
"The most common question used to be: Is the property west-facing? Now my clients' biggest concern is internet quality," Bob Clarke, realtor with Royal LePage Lakes of Muskoka, said in the report.
Royal LePage said its aggregate home price is based on a weighted model using median prices. It did not provide comparable prices for real estate across the entire province, including the cities.
In Quebec's cottage country and vacation locations, the aggregate house price climbed 14.7 per cent to $236,628, with the sharpest increase in Sutton, in the Eastern Townships, where the price jumped 36.6 per cent to $403,000, followed by Les Laurentides and Les Pays d'en haut.
In the Prairies, the aggregate house price in Lac Du Bonnet, Man., climbed 26 per cent and increased by 31.7 per cent in Christopher Lake and Emma Lake, Sask., according to the report.
In B.C., the aggregate home price in the ski resort area of Whistler rose 18 per cent to $2.75-million while prices grew in the high single digits in North and Central Okanagan.
The aggregate house price increased by 8.6 per cent in Atlantic Canada's recreational markets, with an uptick in buyers from Ontario and Quebec, as well as interest from local city residents vying to be closer to nature and water.
"There has also been an increase in buyers from Ontario and Quebec who are choosing the Maritimes as a great place to live and work remotely," Heather FitzGerald, a realtor with Royal's Atlantic brokerage in Moncton, said in the report.
Alberta was the only region in which the aggregate house price fell in the recreational markets, with a dip in Canmore offsetting areas closer to Edmonton. In Canmore, the recreational market closest to Calgary, the price was down almost 10 per cent to $926,000, as demand for luxury properties eased.
But in Wabamun Lake and Lac Ste.
Anne, which is closer to Edmonton, the price was up 14 per cent, according to the report.

Full text: Rogers Communications Inc.'s plan to tear down the Rogers Centre and build a new ballpark in downtown Toronto is likely to win political support because it would be privately funded and could help create more public space, according to planning experts and the local Toronto city councillor.
Rogers and the real estate arm of Brookfield Asset Management Inc. want to build a new stadium, office and condominium towers and design public space on the 12.7acre Rogers Centre site. City councillor Joe Cressy, whose ward includes the 31-yearold dome with a retractable roof, said Friday in an interview that he did not expect there to be any major opposition to the idea of replacing the Rogers Centre. He said he has been assured that no public money would be involved.
"From the early conversations, the discussion was how do we revitalize the stadium and think about other city-building objectives alongside it," Mr. Cressy said. As an example, he said a rebuilt site could deliver the same sort of experience the Raptors created with an outdoor park for fans.
"How do you create a Jurassic Park in a setting that is also animated when games aren't being played?" Mr. Cressy said. "Public space, but also as a gathering space for key moments."
Rogers and Brookfield plan to finance the multibillion-dollar development privately. Various levels of government need to approve the plan. The City of Toronto, for example, would be asked to okay increased density on the site and the federal government owns the land under the facility.
The project would replace a stadium that depended on public funding to pay part of its $570million construction costs.
"The clear understanding from the earliest conversations was that [public funding] was not a consideration here," Mr. Cressy said. "I don't see it as an inherently politically contentious subject."
Rogers bought what was then known as the SkyDome in 2004 for $25-million, after one of the previous owners filed for bankruptcy. Rogers acquired the Jays for US$137-million four years previously. The team and the stadium are now worth an estimated US$1.6-billion, according to Bay Street analysts.
Redeveloping the Rogers Centre, like most large developments, would require amendments to the City of Toronto's official plan and the TOCore downtown plan, which would need approval from city council. This would involve a multiyear process of planning and consultation; real estate experts say it could take at least eight years before the Jays are playing on a new field with natural grass.
Through a spokesperson, Toronto chief planner Gregg Lintern declined to comment. No application has been submitted to the city.
"It is one of the most complicated development sites in the entire city," said Robert Glover, a planner and former principal at the firm Bousfields.
As a city planner, Mr. Glover worked on the planning for the area around the Rogers Centre in the 1980s and 90s. A reconstruction of the centre would require dealing with complex hard infrastructure, he said, including the water-pumping station that is part of the stadium site. A new plan "would have to encompass a larger area around the stadium," he said, accounting for the impacts of several new developments on transit, infrastructure and social services.
"There are a huge number of potential issues to be worked out, [but] I don't think that there would be automatic public or political opposition if it was seen to result in a better city-front area."
Baseball experts say building a new stadium should mean more fans and higher revenues for the Jays. The team's revenues were US$278-million in 2016, then declined over the next three years to $265-million in 2019. Majorleague baseball has not released revenues for the shortened 2020 season, which saw the Jays play their home games in Buffalo because of the pandemic.
"The Jays can achieve the objective of producing substantially increased revenues and fan interest on a consistent basis, by charting a dramatic new path - the path of building a new ballpark," said a study by Toronto-based lawyers Jeffrey Citron and David Steinhauer. "Being complacent could be a huge economic error."
The study says, "As an entertainment product in and of itself, major-league baseball is no longer a consistent, appealing entertainment option for Toronto sports fans. This is particularly the case in the [31]-year-old, sterile, artificial-turf environment of the Rogers Centre."
The Jays, Rogers and Brookfield have kept Ontario Premier Doug Ford in the loop on their stadium plans. However, the Premier's office made it clear on Friday that he has other priorities.
"The proponents made the province aware of this proposal.
We look forward to hearing more about the proposed project," said Ivana Yelich, the Premier's spokesperson. "But at this time, our government's focus is on getting through the second wave of COVID-19 and preparing for the distribution of vaccines in Ontario."

Full text: ‘This is not the first ultramodern building the city erected, but it's the one that broadcast, to the world, that Toronto had come of age," I'd say to my visitor-friend. "It's the one that got the city talking, and average folks in other cities to sit up and take notice."
Then I'd roll up my sleeve and point to my tattoo, since as an architecture columnist celebrating 10 years at The Globe and Mail in 2013, I'd decided to have Toronto City Hall inked onto my forearm for life. The building, and what it represents, is that important to me.
But I don't think I'd take my visitor-friend there first.
To explain, in the 17 years I've been with The Globe's Real Estate section I've been asked dozens of times - almost as a challenge of sorts - where I'd take someone if they were visiting the Big Smoke for the first time.
And, after giving a partial answer or deflecting to the topic of how Toronto is Janus-faced as it's both very Victorian and very modernist (and neo-modernist), it occurs to me that while I've asked luminaries such as Morden Yolles or Jerome Markson to take me on a tour of their favourite buildings and neighbourhoods (and Mr. Raymond Moriyama, I'm still waiting!), I've never officially presented an "architour" of my own creation.
So, here goes: 1. To set the stage, I'd want my visitor to see the city's first construction boom of the late-1800s. It's amazing to me that while the 1851 population was 30,000, a mere four decades later it had sextupled to 181,000. So, to Cabbagetown, one of the largest enclaves of preserved Victorian homes in North America, to gaze at the mix of worker's cottages and larger homes. If there was time, I'd walk them all the way down Parliament Street to the Distillery District, to show that when the Victorians built factories, they built them as mini-cities complete with streets and alleyways and cupolas.
2. To illustrate, literally, Toronto's mix of eras, I'd travel next to Exhibition Place. Not only is it fascinating that the city keeps an 80hectare site open to such flexible uses, it's a space where architects - whether designing pavilions in the beaux-arts or art deco or modernist style - could let loose and have fun, whether that fun came in the form of a glass dome on the 1911 Government Building or the Mondrian-esque structure on the roof of the Better Living Centre (which could use some TLC, by the way).
3. From there, it would be an easy walk to our next stop, Ontario Place. Showing late-modernism by a beloved local architect, Bauhaus-trained Eb Zeidler is a natural, but it's also important to let our visitor know that, for all of our successes in this province, we can lose our way. A white-painted composition of innovative structures sitting directly in the lake, and others on man-made islands, deserve better than to be shuttered for eight years. Perhaps an international competition would help us find a new use?
4. An international competition in 1957-58 is what brought us Toronto City Hall. If I could convince the security people inside, I'd take my visitor into the saucer-shaped council chamber and to the space age Member's Lounge behind it, where the Warren Platner chairs live.
5. Primed for modernism now, I'd escort my guest to Don Mills, specifically Deepwood Crescent.
Long-time readers of this space know of my fascination for Macklin Hancock's "New Town" and how, originally, only modernist architecture was permitted (not just houses, but churches, gas stations, commercial buildings).
While today many streets have been overrun by oversized and insensitive new builds, Deepwood retains most of its charm, plus has the advantage of extra tall trees saved during construction. On the way out, I'd show my visitor the small apartment buildings and light industry to create a town rather than a suburb.
6. Since we'd be discussing residential typologies at this point, I'd want to show off some of Toronto's inner-city neighbourhoods. And here, I'd let my guest choose between Roncesvalles, the Danforth, or Spadina's Chinatown, because each has a high street that offers wider-than-average sidewalks populated by retail shops once dominated by a single ethnic group, but have slowly and sensitively diversified. My area of the Danforth, for instance, was once Little Sicily. They're great places for people watching, too! 7. The final destination might be obvious, but it's a piece of the city I hope never becomes corporatized. As I wrote in my novel, Falconi's Tractor (Guernica Editions, 2019; you know I wrote a novel right? And books make great Christmas gifts!), Kensington Market seems safe due to a sort of "unwritten code" amongst building owners to prevent a Starbucks from moving in. Besides, I wrote, "[m]ost of the shops are shabby little places that have so many layers of poor quality renovations strangling them, it's doubtful a corporate store would be able to peel away enough junk to feel comfortable." With its fish, fruit and cheese markets, vintage clothing stores, ethnic food stalls and bohemian vibe, it's a place that overwhelms the senses ... and couldn't be more "Toronto."
Of course there are other places: dining on the 54th floor of Mies's TD Centre; the obligatory trip up the CN Tower (which I don't mean to diminish, it may very well be my next tattoo!); the Great Hall at Union Station (my wife's favourite "room" in Toronto); a stroll up and down the aisles of St. Lawrence Market; a walking tour of our newest skyscraper district, South Core; or the ebullient 1960s Annex apartment buildings of Uno Prii.
Hmm, perhaps there'll be another of these ... when we can all get outside again.

Full text: 20 Edwin St.
GUELPH, ONT.
Asking Price: $979,000 Selling price: $979,000 Taxes: $5176.05 (2020) Lot Size: 51 feet by 79 feet Listing Agent: Irene Szabo, Home Group Realty Inc.
THE BACKSTORY The development of Bob Desautels's house on 20 Edwin St. in Guelph, Ont., mirrored the development of his restaurant business: It has come together in fits and starts, but the final product just works.
Mr. Desautels found the house in 1990, stopping in to check out an open house on his way home to nearby Exhibition Park.
Liking what he saw - and comparing the price to recent renovation quotes he received - he was preparing to inform his wife when he saw she had also decided to stop and take a look. "I said: ‘Don't say anything! We don't want them to know we like it!' We put in an offer and it was accepted."
This was right around the time he was in the process of taking a second stab at the restaurant business. Mr. Desautels had been teaching hospitality at the University of Guelph when in 1985 he opened a French bistro in a Victorian mansion on Woolwich Street on the edge of the city's downtown. He sold that restaurant, "for a pretty good price," and was carrying on teaching when the new owners ran into some trouble with their landlord and liquor licence. The attached wine bar had been outpacing the French food sales, so Mr. Desautels agreed to take back control, but this time he converted the whole space into a pub, and so The Woolwich Arms - one of the city's favourite pubs - was born.
"When I did it, the micro-brew and craft beer industry was just getting launched.
We did an all craft brewery lineup and it just took off. It was doing about $385,000 volume and within two years it was $1.4-million. I used it in a live case in my fourth-year seminar," he said.
He eventually quit teaching to run the pub full-time, and after years of success decided to renovate his house on 20 Edwin St., in 2006. Shortly afterward he brought his son, Court, to help launch two more restaurants under the brand Borealis Grille and Bar in 2008. In 2010, Bob took a step back from managing the company to write (he has a wine book, and the former philosophy student also writes essays on social change), but has remained a committed environmentalist and a booster of local conservation authorities and community organizations. Indeed, he was an early proponent of buy local for his pub's menu.
His Neighbourhood Group of Companies has continued expanding - Miijidaa Café and Bistro in 2015; Park Grocery Deli & Bar in 2019 - and while The Woolwich Arms was once rebranded The Arrow, it now goes by the name locals have been calling it from the beginning: The Wooly.
They've even managed to make it work through the pandemic restrictions. "We've been fortunate with Wooly; we own the parking lot so we made it a beer garden.
It's been full virtually every night," Mr. Desautels said.
THE HOUSE TODAY The street is a mix of house types: some ornate, some simple, Victorians here, postwar there, there's a stone cottage across the way. It's all walking distance to downtown, and of course, The Wooly. "We go weeks sometimes without ever getting in our car," Mr. Desautels said. The rich orange brick of 20 Edwin St., is almost the same as the brick on The Wooly.
The entryway is a short hallway that ends below the curve in the stairs leading to the second level, there's a closet in the back wall. The rest of the main floor is accessed to the right through a long livingroom (with built-ins) that opens up to a dining room. Off the dining room is Bob's office, formerly the kitchen now virtually a library packed with books. These three spaces make up the original floorplan of the house, but through the dining room is the 2006 extension that doubled the size of the ground floor.
The centre of the addition is the kitchen, set up with features Mr. Desautels likes in restaurant kitchens - chest-height dishwasher for efficient loading, tile countertops that you can rest boiling hot pans on - and a country/cottage feel thanks to the wood cabinets and trim, and ship-lap on the fridge and island. A large pantry room sits off to the side of this space, just past a wine-fridge flush mounted in the wall (next to this is the access to the mostly unfinished basement). A breakfast nook with a brick wall looks ready for your bistro brunch.
One gets the sense this is the working entrance to the house, coming through the double French doors from the extrawide side yard that is covered in interlocking brick (hiding behind a fence and gate off the driveway). "This is probably within a few feet of being severable, I've seen lots for sale smaller than our side yard. ... We literally live out there in the summer," Mr. Desautels said.
The brickwork on this side of the house mimics the original home almost perfectly, using some of the brick borrowed when they took down the back wall, right down to the decorative soldering above the windows. "This street was once called the garden street of Guelph, we set up our backyard as perennial plants and keep a little fish pond out there as well," Mr. Desautels said.
Behind the kitchen is the house's primary bedroom, to access it you slip past the laundry room and a powder-roomsized washroom with an open shower stall (tiled with decorative pieces from a local artisan). The primary bedroom is simple, with high ceilings and new strip oak floor and the ensuite bathroom has another exposed brick wall as well as a soaker tub and separate shower stall.
Upstairs are three more bedrooms, the smallest of which is L-shaped and perhaps better suited as an office. The other two are comparable in size, though only one has a closet (Victorian homes!). There is a large updated bathroom on this level complete with claw-foot tub and shower ring, next to a deep walk-in closet. Skylights have been added in several rooms, pouring lots of light into rooms first laid down in 1880.
BEST FEATURE Location, location, location. This close to downtown Guelph there is fairly low inventory, and a number of the buildings are listed as heritage-protected by the historical society, making it difficult to add modern scale to the hot area. There were only six other houses listed in the city's core, priced between $600,000 and $1-million.
Mr. Desautels house sold for its asking price of $979,000 within three days of hitting the market this month, agent Irene Szabo said. "This is the lowest inventory in about 20 years in Guelph ... but this [price] would be in the higher band, not much in downtown goes for more than a million," she said.
Mr. Desautels and his wife are downsizing to a condo in town, but will probably be spending their summers at their cottage until they can travel again (he misses Provence, his favoured vacation getaway).
When he's in town he'll always have a comfortable spot to bend an elbow.

Full text: Five years ago, dentist Amit Chaudhry and his wife, Nami Dhillon, decided to move from the Toronto suburb of Mississauga to the nearby town of Oakville. Whereas Mississauga is large, sprawling and car-centric, Oakville - and, more specifically Old Oakville, where the couple now live - is the kind of walkable place where neighbours say hi to one another over their white picket fences or manicured cedar hedges. As well as the tight-knit community, the town also offered close proximity to top private schools for Dr. Chaudhry and Ms. Dhillon's daughters, Diya and Samira.
Dr. Chaudhry and Ms. Dhillon bought a home while they were on vacation in Vancouver. Purchasing sight unseen wasn't a concern; they were sold by the location - around the corner from Old Oakville's main street of mom-and-pop boutiques and restaurants - as well as the wide, tree-covered lot. There was a dated bungalow on the site, but the plan was to tear down and start over with their dream home. "We were always going to build a home to our exact needs and specifications," Ms. Dhillon says.
Dr. Chaudhry, however, did have one reservation. "I like modern," he says. "Oakville is more traditional, maybe transitional, not necessarily modern."
To Dr. Chaudhry's point, Old Oakville is dotted with a seemingly inordinate number of clapboard homes, with sash windows and louvered shutters and a certain, Norman Rockwell-ian vibe.
A truly stark modern box might have tested the limits of the neighbours, provoked froidure from behind the white picket fences. But the house they built, with local architect David Small, works hard to fit into the streetscape. There are modern clean lines and big glass windows, yet it's all clad in stately, rough-hewn stone and rustic wood panelling.
The interiors of the 6,000square-foot abode hews more closely to Dr. Chaudhry's modern vision. Crisp volumes are lined with either white walls or panels of white oak, accented with sleek black marble slabs. With that too, though, there is an approachable, friendly warmth to the minimalism. Bold, jewel-toned furniture and brightly-hued rugs dot the rooms. Brass light fixtures hang from above.
The warmth is no accident. For the interiors, Dr. Chaudhry and Ms. Dhillon approached young designers Kevin Chan and Samer Shaath, founders of Nivek Remas. The couple picked Nivek Remas in part because of their credentials. The designers had previously worked for Yabu Pushelberg, a celebrated Canadian studio that envisioned the interiors for one of Dr. Chaudhry's favourite modern hotels: the Four Seasons in downtown Toronto.
"I love all the wood in the hotel," Dr. Chaudhry says. "I love all the details. It has a quality that Kevin and Samer kept talking about - it's modern, but it's also warm."
The fine detailing in the house befits a five-star hotel. Bookmatched, fine-grained walnut in a bathroom over a marble vanity.
Recessed curtain railings, so the drapes appear to fall across the floor-to-ceiling windows directly from the ceiling.
There's also a hotel-style graciousness to the plan. As guests arrive, passing through a doubleheight foyer, they can either continue straight into the living room, turn left into the formal dining room or turn right and stop for cocktails in the library, where open-shelving soars up around a built-in, stocked bar.
"My wife was raised in London," Dr. Chaudhry says. "Very much in a cocktails in the evening before dinner sort of way."
As with the best lobby-side bars, the library strikes the right atmosphere. Its tall, south-facing windows catch the edge of evening light through soft, diaphanous curtains. The light is not just warm, it is enchanting, and might only be outdone by the living room, where on one wall, a two-storey fireplace soars above the double-height space. The white veins of the stone look like abstract art. The hearth, open to three sides, is the heart of the home - a place no one wants to pull themselves away from, especially on a crisp autumn night.
Going far might not be necessary: the living room is open to a neighbouring kitchen, the cabinets swathed in black marble that echoes the fireplace.
The kitchen off the living room is the hotel equivalent of front of house feature, a bit like a concierge desk. There's an island where guests can sit, chat as a snack is being prepared. Nearby, there's a second kitchen that's strictly back-of-house, behind closed doors. "It's where you do your more heavy duty cooking," designer Kevin Chan says. "It's more common in Asia where they use more spices."
Dr. Chaudhry and Ms. Dhillon love to entertain and frequently have friends and family stay over.
The house, which has five bedrooms, is set up to make guests as comfortable as possible. There is a full home gym clad in sleek black tiles like something out of Wayne Manor, and both of the guest rooms have their own ensuites. "We wanted to be able to give our guests their privacy," Dr.
Chaudhry says.
There is one additional guest room that's more roughing it than luxury resort - a wood-lined room in the basement with no ensuite, just twin stacked beds, sleeping four people like something from a Muskoka bunk house. "We don't have a cottage," Dr. Chaudhry says. "The bunk room is for when our daughters have their friends over, have sleepovers. It's nice that our home has that sense of escape."

Full text: Three of Canada's largest banks are planning to keep most of their employees working remotely until the spring, pushing back plans to get back to offices amid a spike in cases of the novel coronavirus.
On Wednesday, Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce and Bank of Montreal each told employees that most people currently working remotely should expect to do so until at least April. CIBC made the decision in light of the "latest health authority guidance," said Sandy Sharman, CIBC's head of people, culture and brand, in a memo sent to the bank's staff on Wednesday.
BMO told staff on Wednesday it doesn't expect any broadbased changes to its current work-from-home arrangements "any sooner than April" unless specific business needs arise, a spokesperson said.
And on Nov. 16, Toronto-Dominion Bank's executive vicepresident of human resources, Kenn Lalonde, sent a memo to employees across the bank predicting that a large-scale return to TD's offices is "not likely until at least the spring."
TD and CIBC have promised at least four weeks notice before any plans to return employees to the office take effect, to give staff time to plan. "The situation remains very fluid, with different conditions across our footprint," Mr. Lalonde said in his memo.
"Therefore, there's no easy answer to the question: When will I return to the workplace?" The three banks are some of the largest companies to extend their remote working arrangements until next spring, although each has many staff that have been working on-site in critical roles at branches, data centres and some offices. The widespread shift to remote work has added implications for CIBC, which is in the midst of building and designing its new headquarters, CIBC Square, which is expected to house about 14,000 employees in downtown Toronto when it is finished.
"With the majority of our team members working from home seamlessly, we have the flexibility to align our decisions and timing around our longterm real estate plans, including CIBC Square and the guidance we receive from local governments and public health authorities," Ms. Sharman said in her note to staff.
Promising results from clinical trials of vaccines have boosted optimism that companies may be able to return to more normal working conditions sometime next year. But "we recognize that even in a best-case scenario, we're at least a few months away from a broadly available vaccine," Mr. Lalonde said.
Early this week, Ontario's government imposed stricter lockdown measures on Toronto and the nearby Peel region, where COVID-19 cases are surging, asking businesses to urge employees to work from home when possible.
CIBC, TD and other major banks including Royal Bank of Canada had previously advised that most staff were expected to keep working remotely until the new year, at the earliest. RBC has also promised to give at least four weeks notice before returning staff to work.
On Nov. 12, RBC urged any staff in the Greater Toronto Area who were working on-site, and who are able to work remotely, to go back to working from home starting on Nov. 16. The bank also delayed a program that allowed employees in the GTA to come into offices to retrieve personal items.

Supply of top air filters can't meet demand in pandemic

Full text: Air filters have become big business in the age of COVID-19 for heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) companies - at least for those that can get their hands on them.
As indoor air quality becomes a major concern in places of business, HVAC companies are struggling to keep up with demand for high-quality filtration systems.
Air filters, it turns out, are made of similar materials to those used in face masks and other personal protective equipment, putting them in short supply, says Gregg Little, president of Springbank Mechanical Systems in Southern Ontario.
"We work with dozens of different developers, and they are all looking at that," Mr. Little says.
Claudio Mastronardi, Toronto branch manager at Carmichael Engineering Ltd., says his HVAC company is jumping to buy inventory of high-grade filters to keep clients from facing four-tosix-week turnarounds.
"The demand right now is very high. People are putting their health and safety ahead of cost," says Mr. Mastronardi.
The Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver dubbed "indoor air quality" as a top real estate trend to emerge from the pandemic, noting that the pandemic "created more demand for air purifiers, ranging from stand-alone models to sophisticated smart systems."
Portable air purifiers are also getting harder and harder to find, notes Jeffrey Siegel, a professor in the University of Toronto's Department of Civil & Mineral Engineering who studies indoor air quality.
That doesn't mean business has been easy for HVAC companies, notes Mr. Little, who says that many clients have slashed their maintenance budgets because they can't afford to stay open. Demand has been on a roller coaster, as some clients who initially upgraded to fancier filters couldn't carry the cost, while purchases from dentists' and doctors' offices that "went crazy" buying air filters this spring have since levelled off.
That said, HVAC operators have noticed a new-found recognition for their expertise in light of COVID-19, Mr. Little says, and engineers have their pick of clients who previously may not have given much thought to the person turning on their heater, says Mr. Mastronardi.
Demand for HVAC companies has spiked as local jurisdictions push tenants to look at their buildings' HVAC systems. Toronto's medical officer of health on Nov. 14 told businesses to review their HVAC systems to make sure they work and that they have increased air-exchange settings, are using the highest efficiency filters and aren't blocking air vents or putting furniture directly beneath them.
But the city's public-health officials also advise that "there is no evidence to show that air purifiers on their own are effective in reducing the spread of COVID-19."
"If you have an infected person and an uninfected person close together, even if there's a great filtering system somewhere else, it's not going to capture the virus," Prof. Siegel says.

Developers target suburbs as condo demand in downtown Toronto falters amid pandemic

Full text: Toronto suburbs are experiencing a boom in condo project launches and preconstruction sales, as the pandemic's work-from-home trend entices homebuyers to look outside the city.
Suburban condo projects accounted for 65 per cent of all launches in the Toronto region in the third quarter of this year, according to the latest data from industry research group Urbanation Inc.
This is not the first time suburban condo development has surpassed the city's, but marks the widest margin on record. As well, sales of preconstruction condos more than doubled in the suburbs compared with the third quarter of last year, while sales dropped 16 per cent in the city of Toronto over the same time period.
"Downtown Toronto projects are not seeing the same level of enthusiasm from buyers as they were pre-COVID," said Kash Pashootan, chief executive of Emblem Developments, which recently launched a 17-storey, 336-unit condo project in Mississauga. "For the time being, the premium that you pay for being downtown is not being realized," he said.
Interest in the Toronto suburbs, also known as the 905 because of its area code, has been growing for years as homebuyers could get larger homes at much cheaper prices. But since the pandemic started, the desire for homes with more space for an office and backyard supercharged competition in the 905.
And with office employees forced to work from home and businesses considering permanent remote work, it has become easier for workers to live outside the city of Toronto.
Home resale prices across all types of properties have risen at a faster pace in the regions surrounding the city. For condos in the city, the home price index was up 5 per cent in October, compared with the same month last year, according to the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board. In contrast, to the west in the Halton area, the price index for condos was up 11 per cent. To the east in Durham region, the index climbed 12 per cent. That has influenced developers and preconstruction condo investors and homebuyers. Although homes are becoming more expensive in the 905, prices are still lower in general. For example, the price of a preconstruction condo sold on average for $915 a square foot in the 905 versus $1,275 in Toronto, according to Urbanation.
"Part of the trend can be connected to the more general shift in demand across the resale market for suburban properties as a result of COVID-19," Urbanation president Shaun Hildebrand said.
Meanwhile, the downtown office district is currently a ghost town. The office vacancy rate has been steadily climbing, as a sea of businesses from PricewaterhouseCoopers to Ritual Technologies, put some of their space on the sublet market.
Condo resales and rental rates have taken a hit in Toronto. In October, condo resales dropped 8.5 per cent and the average selling price was up just 0.8 per cent compared with the same month last year, according to the local real estate board. In contrast, condo resales in the 905 were up 28 per cent and the average selling price increased by 7 per cent over the same time period.
"People wanted to be close to where they work. But the nature of work is changing a little," said Matt Elkind, senior broker with Connect Realty who works with investors and has observed more interest in the 905. "Even though COVID is a temporary thing, people are rethinking if they have to go to the office," he said.
Rental vacancies are up and rental prices are down in the city.
As well, many owners of Airbnb units have put their properties on the long-term rental market or up for sale after tourism disappeared.
That has increased supply in the downtown core, just as the market was being flooded with a stream of new condo units. The glut of condos has given some developers pause. "Any sort of inventory is a deterrent to launching a project," said Mr. Pashootan, who like other real estate players says he believes that interest in the core will quickly recover when the pandemic subsides and the economy reopens.

Full text: For three decades, Ghyslain Anctil has been repairing shoes and leatherwear at his Moneysworth & Best franchise on the ground floor of Montreal's Place Ville Marie, the crossshaped tower housing law firms, tech enterprises and other companies that make up the pulse of Quebec's business community.
This time of year is normally his busiest as regular customers such as former prime minister Brian Mulroney, now a senior partner with Norton Rose Fulbright, gussy up their footwear for the holidays and snap up new galoshes. His four-person staff is typically hustling full tilt as crowds of people stream by, many popping in to see if their orders are ready.
Not this year.
"It's very slow. Some days we do almost nothing," Mr. Anctil said last week, adding that he runs the shop with just his son now. "I feel like we're a sailboat without any wind. We're just kind of floating without moving."
Nine months since the coronavirus pandemic forced Quebec into a widespread lockdown of businesses from which it still has not fully emerged, Montreal's once-vibrant downtown core is reeling. The white-collar workers that fuel its micro-economy, the estimated 400,000 sharp-dressers who spend millions of dollars a year in its shops, restaurants and salons, haven't come back to the office. And that is raising fears of a permanent exodus that will cause lasting damage once the pandemic is over, turning a city centre known for its chic conviviality into a dull has-been.
After closing office buildings in the spring, Quebec announced in July that it would permit a return to them and mandated a maximum 25 per cent capacity per workplace. Four months later, however, most of Montreal's towers sit largely empty as a vast majority of workers embrace teleworking.
The Chamber of Commerce of Metropolitan Montreal estimates the city's office space is currently operating at less than 10-per-cent capacity and maybe closer to 5 per cent, meaning as few as 20,000 people are coming in to work every day in person. The downtown core's permanent residents, who number barely 40,000, aren't numerous enough to make up the shortfall of keeping other businesses running in the core. Other major centres such as Toronto and Vancouver are nowhere near as dependent as Montreal on inbound commuters and transit-takers for their lifeblood.
On the streets and in the indoor plazas of downtown Montreal, the constant murmur of voices and footsteps is gone, leaving the air filled by the shrill and sporadic bleeps of construction equipment.
Everywhere there are shops and restaurants that are closed, some for now and some for good. Food-court seating has either been cordoned off or removed entirely.
In August, 26 per cent of all downtown businesses zoned for retail were vacant either permanently or temporarily. That is nearly double the 14 per cent at the same time last year, according to a recent report on the city centre published by Quebec's Urban Development Institute. That was before Quebec tightened its pandemic protocols again in September, forcing restaurants and cultural venues to lock their doors once more after a summer reopening. The desperation and ennui is accelerating. A brunch spot proclaims in big bright yellow lettering "We're OPEN!" in a desperate plea for attention. Employees at retailers from La Senza to Bath & Body Works are just milling about. One staffer at Boutique 5e Avenue, which faces a particularly daunting challenge these days selling formal wear while people are working at home in sweatpants, preened in a mirror.
"We're surviving" by offering online workouts, said Dino Masson, owner of YUL Fitness, a tiny but popular gym in the basement of a 28-storey tower at 1000 Sherbrooke West. The sign on his door says "Closed until Oct. 28." The date has been scratched out and replaced by "Nov. 23."
Last Thursday, Premier François Legault said his government would maintain the restrictions until at least Jan. 11.
No one is watching the situation more closely than Chamber of Commerce chief executive Michel Leblanc, who has repeatedly evoked, during online events, his concern for the future of Montreal's downtown core.
His nightmare scenario: The "doughnut" effect that has befallen so many other North American cities. In other words, a hole in the middle where you have few people living and few people working and staying after hours. That means lower sales for the businesses catering to the office crowd, which in turn makes the city core even less appealing. One feeds the other and then you have a structural problem, Mr. Leblanc said.
"As workers will be given the option of a hybrid work schedule over the next months and perhaps years and perhaps for the rest of their lives, we would not want people to feel that they would much rather stay at home and work from home because they fear that the downtown is not safe," Mr. Leblanc said. "We're very far from [that happening]. But that is the concern if we do not make sure that enough of the commercial base survives."
Montreal's DNA is about having fun safely in the downtown core, well into the night, at any time of the year, Mr. Leblanc said. And it's imperative that business and political leaders make sure that everything attracting people to the city centre - all the unique cultural institutions, restaurants and hotels - remain viable and ready to reopen.
Government aid is one piece of that puzzle. Although there's been no formal financial assistance for Canada's urban cores, there has been general and targeted support for specific business on things such as rent and other fixed costs.
Quebec has also introduced a loan forgiveness program for the restaurant industry to help boost revenues over time and last week pledged another $65-million to help businesses that operate in the tourism sector. Downtown business owners have renewed calls for a major cut to commercial tax rates, which are the country's highest.
Without customers, however, the prospects of recovering what is lost dims by the day. The city and local groups made a valiant effort during the summer to inject some life into Montreal's core with a campaign called Relancez l'été, or "Jump start summer." They're doing other things now, such as offering free parking downtown in the evenings and on weekends, and allowing merchants to extend their store hours.
There's even a dedicated downtown streetcleaning brigade.
But unlike during summer, there aren't a lot of obvious reasons for people living in greater Montreal to want to come downtown at this time of year, Mr. Leblanc said.
Construction on Sainte Catherine Street, downtown's main shopping artery, makes it even less attractive, he adds. "At this moment, I think it's almost trying to convince people to do it as a form of civic duty," he said.
The thousands of students, tourists and business travellers who feed the downtown economy are also largely absent. But it's the office workers who really need to come back, said Emile Roux, head of the SDC Destination Centre Ville, a non-profit group of nearly 5,000 businesses located in the quadrant between Atwater Avenue and Saint Urbain Street and between Sherbrooke and Saint Antoine streets. Why they're not returning, even in numbers approaching government-imposed limits, is a major frustration for him and other local leaders.
"We're facing an issue of perception" in Montreal's professional labour force, Mr. Roux said. "Offices are safe. There haven't been any outbreaks in offices downtown since they reopened. But the perception is different."
Former Quebec finance minister Carlos Leitao, an economist by training, said the reluctance of some people to use public transit is part of it. But he said he believes there's another reason: Remote working has not been the disaster many predicted.
It works for the kind of financial and professional services companies and government agencies that populate Montreal's downtown, and he believes it's here to stay.
The question is to what extent that alters the city centre in the years to come.
"We'll have to rethink the way downtown works. We'll have to rethink the office tower," Mr. Leitao said. He said it's not the role of government to force companies to bring back their staff but said the public sector could lead by example. Complexe Desjardins, for example, houses about 7,000 workers from Revenu Québec who could be recalled in numbers respecting health guidelines, he said.
Mr. Roux says reinvention for Montreal could include retailers reorganizing themselves to offer immediate in-store product pickup to attract shoppers tired of waiting for home delivery. He says downtown could also try to bring in more local tourists.
There's also an opportunity for a much bolder remake that would transform downtown towers into more multipurpose environments while increasing the scope of their public spaces, said Carmela Cucuzzella, co-director of Concordia University's Next-Generation Cities Institute. Think indoor parks and gymnasiums.
"The downtown core is not going to look like it looked like a year ago," Prof. Cucuzzella said. "These spaces have to become more dynamic in their use. That is the bottom line."
Many Montreal companies coming to the end of their leases are buying time trying to figure out what their employees want because competition for the best talent remains, said Luciano D'Iorio, managing director of Quebec operations for Cushman & Wakefield, a commercial real estate services company. How that shakes out will determine the downtown's future. The character of the city centre is at stake, he said. "You think of some of the iconic places on the map and ... you hope they're going to be around."
Like others, Mr. Leitao is optimistic that Montreal's fundamentals - all the tech companies, students and big employers that anchor the central area - will leave it better positioned than other cities. He says the real risk is that of widespread failures among the smaller businesses serving them.
"We have to be careful. Because if we let those things go, it could take years to [rebuild]."

Full text: If not for the COVID-19 pandemic, the Grey Cup would have been awarded for the 108th time this Sunday in the football-loving city of Regina.
For the first time since 1919, there will be no Grey Cup championship game. In the summer, the CFL kicked about plans for a shortened season in a hub city, then became one of the few pro sports leagues in North America to cancel its 2020 campaign altogether.
There may be hope for next year's Cup, however. Encouraged by the positive news this week about a vaccine, the CFL released its 2021 schedule Friday - a full slate of games starting on June 10 and concluding with the Grey Cup on Nov. 21 in Hamilton.
"We're looking forward to hosting our comeback season in our stadiums, in front of our fans," CFL commissioner Randy Ambrosie said.
Without a season, players haven't been paid. Most under contract with a team qualified for the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy. For many, this was the first season without football since they began the sport as kids.
During this long pause, many players have taken up other pursuits to make money, to lay the framework for life after football or just to stay active - from coaching to gaming, podcasting to real estate and finance, appbased gigs to entrepreneurial endeavours.
"It's unlike most other professional sports where everyone is making millions of dollars. For the most part, players in the CFL are making comparable money to the fans that go to the games," said Winnipeg Blue Bombers defensive lineman Jake Thomas, who is a real estate agent in the booming New Brunswick housing market. "I don't think the average person can go a year-plus without a real paycheque. So I think a lot of guys have had to find jobs or move into their postcareer plan."
Players with more lucrative contracts may have put money away, or can live for a while off signing bonuses. Some turned to the second job they already had, such as Bombers linebacker Adam Bighill, who is also a financial adviser. These days, he gets up at 5 a.m. to train before spending the rest of his day helping people manage their money in a complicated economy. He also sells his own speed-training workout regimen to athletes, called The Speed Code.
"It's interesting to see how guys have adapted," Bighill said.
"They've been forced to figure out something they're passionate about and how they'll build a career for life after football."
Nate Behar, a receiver with the Ottawa Redblacks last season, became a free agent and hadn't secured a contract for 2020, so he didn't get the Canadian government's wage subsidy. He has been coaching at football camps and working on his new tech startup, ATNMY Marketing, set for launch soon. ATNMY (pronounced autonomy) is a mobile and web platform that matches Olympians, other athletes and health and wellness professionals with brands that will pay them as social-media influencers.
"I have every intention of playing another season of professional football," Behar said. "This company has been building more momentum than I could ever have imagined. Making both work is something I know I can find a way to do."
Natey Adjei, a receiver for the Toronto Argonauts, is busy with two ventures. Several days a week at two Toronto parks, he runs small-group outdoor fun workouts for kids whose sports have been cancelled. He also started the All Ball podcast, chasing down guests from Ricky Ray to Jose Bautista.
His talent caught the attention of Toronto radio station The Fan590, which is now using him as a football contributor.
"I always wanted to be in media someday when I'm done playing, so I thought this would be a perfect entry point," Adjei said. "Everybody's at home, there is access to Zoom to do interviews and, everyone is looking to have connections."
The CFL Players' Association that lists jobs at companies at which CFL alumni and supporters are in positions to hire.
Several CFL players are trying their hand at podcasting, including Saskatchewan Roughriders quarterbacks Cody Fajardo and Isaac Harker, who have started The Rouge Report.
"Well I figured out I'm a hustler - trying to find any way to make some money," Fajardo said with a laugh on a Zoom call with reporters this week. He's among many CFL players recording Cameos (personalized messages) for fans.
Argos receiver Juwan Brescacin, an avid gamer, learned about the lucrative world of videogame streaming by launching his own Twitch channel. He is building a community there and entertaining subscribers. He also organized a Call of Duty videogame tournament for CFL players.
Lots of players are leaning on their football expertise.
Bombers running back Andrew Harris and friend DJ Lalama, a Montreal Alouettes linebacker, launched the Pro Prep Flag Football League. With organized tackle football cancelled in Winnipeg for high school and college athletes, they got local approval to run a physically distanced 7-on-7 flag version of the game earlier this fall - before stricter protocols recently took effect in Manitoba and shut things down. Time off football has allowed Harris and Lalama to bolster Pro Prep Academy, their business that trains young athletes. They recently added Canadian soccer star Desiree Scott to their operation.
Alouettes star quarterback Vernon Adams Jr. made headlines in the summer when he was driving for Uber Eats to make a little extra money. He said this week he now spends most of his time on the field working with young quarterbacks and receivers near his home in Tacoma, Wash., picking up experience for later in life.
"I definitely want to coach down the road; I actually got to coach in a high school all-star game a few weeks ago," Adams said. "Yeah, that's an experience I wouldn't have been able to have if I was playing right now. So there's some beauty in the struggle."
Hamilton Tiger-Cats pivot Dane Evans accepted a position as a graduate-assistant coach of quarterbacks at North Texas University. He has had a front-row view to a football season operating during a pandemic right in his home state - experiencing the travel, the constant testing, mask-wearing and the last-minute cancellations and quarantining of players who test positive for COVID-19.
"I called [Ticats coach Orlondo Steinauer] right away and told him ‘I'm not retiring, I just have a great opportunity for this season' and he was really supportive," Evans said. "Anybody that knows coaching knows it's all about connections. I knew one coach when I got in the door here, and now I have learned from so many here, so this time has been super beneficial to my future career." said it noticed a big uptick in players utilizing its CFLPA Academy.
It connects players with education, job training, mentorships and a Players4Players program

Municipalities vexed by Ontario zoning orders

Full text: THE LISTING The increasing use of a once rarely used, veto-like power - the Ministerial Zoning Order (MZO) - to overrule local planning authority has officials in some Ontario communities feeling bullied and ignored.
"It's just a slap in the face," said Tom Mrakas, Mayor of Aurora. "It makes you think, why are we as municipalities spending all this time and effort on planning if you're going to just come in and do as you want?" Mr. Mrakas has become vocal in his opposition to part of an MZO that rezoned 10 acres of provincially owned industrial land in Aurora to allow for residential development. The Aurora property was one of three sites the province is attempting to sell through commercial realtor CBRE as a portfolio aimed at creating more than 800 long-term care beds, but Aurora's is the only parcel that was rezoned to allow residential construction.
"There was no consultation," said Mr. Mrakas, who added he has requested but not received a call from the minister responsible for the order, Steve Clark, the Minister of Municipal Affairs and Housing. "Our staff gets a call; ‘Oh by the way, an MZO has been issued: Six acres will be zoned R9,' - the highest density in our town," he said. "They'll put a spin on it; ‘We're also providing affordable housing.' Thirty-foot lots in Aurora are starting at a million dollars - that's not affordable housing. So let's be honest here and let's be real."
Like Mr. Mrakas, there is a growing awareness among Ontario's municipal leaders that there is no mechanism to appeal a MZO and there is no requirement for the province to consult or to obtain agreement from a lower level of government when imposing them.
More than 30 MZOs have been issued since 2019; in the past the typical rate was one a year. The Federation of North Toronto Residents' Associations combed through Ontario's Archives and found that between, 1969 and 2000, the MZO was used just 49 times.
"They are a way the province can exert itself for things of provincial interest, traditionally they have been used for economic development," said David Amborski, director of the Centre for Urban Research and Land Development for Ryerson University, who has been studying the MZOs issued by the present government.
Mr. Amborski said the power originates from a time when many Ontario communities lacked official plans, or professional planners. Some examples of MZOs by previous governments include approvals for manufacturing plants in Woodstock, a distribution centre in Bolton and on a number of occasions to allow slot machines at provincial casinos.
Many of these MZOs are not contentious. For instance The City of Toronto has voted twice in the past year to seek an MZO in order to speed up the delivery of pandemic-related projects.
Those included two modular housing developments for the homeless and a zoning change to allow outdoor-dining patios at restaurants across the city.
Mr. Amborski said about 12 of the recent orders filed by Mr. Clark were for long-term care facilities, and the province has indicated it will continue to use MZOs in so-called transit-oriented communities, essentially adding more housing density to areas close to public transit stops.
"Projects that would help support our economic recovery from the impacts of COVID-19, including the building of much needed transit and housing - are often slowed down by burdensome and duplicative red tape," reads a statement the ministry provided to The Globe and Mail in response to questions about MZO use. "The enhanced authority, while working in partnership with municipalities, will assist with overcoming potential barriers and delays for critical projects that wouldn't otherwise be resolved."
Earlier this year Mr. Clark struck a positive tone when describing the orders, telling TVO on July 10: "We've worked very collaboratively with municipalities with every MZO I've done."
On the same day he used an MZO to overrule Peel Region on a rezoning application for a new subdivision that had been twice rejected, though in that case the Town of Caledon and its council was in favour of rezoning the socalled Mayfield West site and requested the minister's order.
In a move that surprised Toronto City Council and its planning department, the minister in October issued an order allowing above-guideline heights for several high-rise buildings proposed for three parcels of provincially owned land in downtown Toronto's West Don Lands.
"What we keep hearing is we need to move faster on these things, and we agree. In the West Don Lands one of the applications was going to council, the work had been done," said Toronto deputy Mayor Ana Bailao, referring to one of the three parcels that was due to be voted on that very week. "Coming in with a hammer is not the appropriate way ... you can't just bulldozer over city plans," she said.
The negotiations between local councillors, planners and the development community is often seen as a barter session where density and height are traded for community benefits and support for city infrastructure.
"When you grow population, the city needs to fund infrastructure: everything from pipes and daycare and parks," Toronto's chief planner Gregg Lintern said.
"All I'm asking is that [the province] collaborate with us. You don't have to come in the dark of night, you can say openly, ‘We're considering an MZO here.' We have to live with the consequences of these developments after the province is gone."
"It's so frustrating," Toronto Centre Councillor Kristyn WongTam said. "We're master planning a community [in the West Don Lands] ... it's critical people have access to basic facilities."
The West Don Lands developer, DKT, a consortium of three companies - Dream, Kilmer Group and Tricon Residential - was selected by the previous Liberal government. They say the site will, among other things, deliver 700 affordable rental units.
"We may still land in the place where we need to," Ms. WongTam said. "[The] developer has given us verbal and written commitment they will work with us on the site plan."
In recent weeks Mr. Clark, who was not made available for an interview, has made several comments on Twitter justifying the use of MZOs. He has said, "the status quo wasn't working," and claimed some of the credit for 15,000 new housing starts in the province. The ministry has said it reviews each application it receives on a case-by-case basis, but indicated in its statement a broad goal behind the use of MZOs: "These Minister's Zoning Orders will help speed up the planning process so that municipalities can be ready, once the COVID-19 emergency declaration ends, to move forward on these projects."
In Aurora, the mayor welcomes the long-term care centre, but said he would not be moved on the residential housing.
"I will look for any and all tools available as a mayor to fight this any which way I can," Mr. Mrakas said. "If someone buys the property, they will still have to come with a site plan, and I can tell you [as] a matter of fact: Any site plan that comes to our council for that spot will be a big ‘No.' "

Full text: The chief executive officer of Alberta's $119-billion, governmentowned fund manager is departing in the wake of a $2.1-billion loss this year that was traced to flaws in the Crown corporation's risk management and corporate culture.
Kevin Uebelein, CEO of the Alberta Investment Management Corp. since 2015, will leave by the end of June, 2021, the Edmontonbased fund manager said Wednesday. AIMCo director of communications Dénes Németh said: "This decision is Kevin's. His natural term ending date is in the not-too-distant future, and accordingly he believes that the board should begin the search for his successor now."
AIMCo invests on behalf of 31 clients, including pension plans for provincial government employees and Alberta's $17-billion Heritage Savings Trust Fund. The fund manager lost $2.1-billion on trading strategies linked to market volatility in the spring and early summer.
The investments performed far worse than expected as stock markets plunged, then rallied as the pandemic hit North America.
AIMCo significantly underperformed peers during this period.
An independent audit commissioned by AIMCo's board subsequently concluded the fund manager's investment and risk management systems were at fault. In a report, the board said: "The breadth and depth of risk governance controls, collaboration and risk culture, while evolving and improving over the past 2-3 years, are still unsatisfactory."
AIMCo appointed a new chairman in June: former Canada Pension Plan Investment Board CEO Mark Wiseman. Shortly thereafter, AIMCo vice-president of public equities Peter Pontikes and portfolio manager David Triska departed. Both oversaw the volatility trading strategy.
In October, AIMCo recruited a new chief risk officer, Andrew Tambone, the former chief investment officer of the Workers' Compensation Board - Alberta.
The fund manager also created a new role, a chief investment strategy officer who reports to the CEO, and hired Bank of Montreal veteran Amit Prakash, who oversaw alternative asset strategies as a managing director at BMO Global Asset Management.
The executive is turning over as Alberta Premier Jason Kenney moves forward with plans to bring the independently run, $18-billion pension plan for provincial teachers into AIMCo, a move the teachers' union opposes. Mr. Kenney's government has also begun a study into moving Alberta's contributions to the Canada Pension Plan into a new provincial pension, and AIMCo has been discussed as a potential operator of such a plan.
"AIMCo faces several important inflection points, including the integration of important new clients and responding to and recovering from a tumultuous global economy," Mr. Uebelein said in an internal e-mail to AIMCo staff and clients on Wednesday.
"These factors, and others, will take years to fully address and accomplish. For this reason, I believe that now is the right time for identifying the next chief executive."
Mr. Uebelein's compensation totalled $2.8-million last year, making him one of the best-paid civil servants in Alberta. Public filings from AIMCo clients show the fund manager was one of Canada's worst-performing pension plans in the first three months of 2020, and has consistently missed performance benchmarks.
The $3-billion Special Forces Pension Plan for police officers, an AIMCo client, reported in early June that its fund was down 12.2 per cent in the first quarter of this year, compared with a 6.7-per-cent decline in their benchmark. AIMCo posted a 10.2-per-cent loss on a $50-billion portfolio belonging to its largest client, a fund for health care and municipal workers called the Local Authorities Pension Plan, or LAPP. The average Canadian pension plan lost 8.7 per cent of its value in the first three months of this year, according to consulting firm Mercer.
In addition to losses on volatility-linked strategies, filings from clients show AIMCo turned in poor results in the first three months of the year in stock, bonds, real estate and private equity investments.
Last year, LAPP said AIMCo's results fell short of the pension plan's value-added expectations for 46 consecutive quarters, or 11 years 6 months.
In April, Mr. Uebelein apologized for the losses on volatility trading, and said in an open letter: "Let me be clear, the performance of this investment is wholly unsatisfactory, and AIMCo's board and management share the frustration and disappointment of our clients, their beneficiaries and all Albertans."

Full text: On an unseasonably warm October afternoon, the Horseshoe Tavern on Toronto's Queen Street West was eerily quiet. A few diners sat on its makeshift sidewalk patio. No one was inside. Since mid-March, the 73-year-old music venue, a beloved institution on one of the city's busiest commercial streets, has either been closed or empty.
For a brief period in August, when Toronto eased pandemic restrictions, the Horseshoe started lining up its fall concert schedule. Then COVID-19 cases soared, and the province restricted activity once again.
And that pretty much killed business in a place that once held shows six nights a week, in a space small enough that you could run into the musicians at the bar or in the bathroom. Owner Jeff Cohen has used every government program available: rent relief, wage subsidies, an interest-free loan, a special heritage grant and a city tax break.
That's in addition to blowing through his savings and line of credit.
"It is getting frustrating eight to nine months in," says Mr. Cohen. "Live music is not a superspreader. We are not a bar. We are not a night club. We are not a dance club. Nothing wild is going on."
The Horseshoe isn't the only one suffering. Queen Street West is dotted with closed shops, "for lease" signs and vacant storefronts. One barbershop is full, and a few cafés have queues outside their shops, but most stores are empty.
In Vancouver, on downtown Robson Street, things are a bit more lively.
On another October afternoon, there's a steady flow of shoppers with bags from Aritzia, Nous Sommes Chocolat and Plenty. A couple dozen people are lined up outside Zara, another handful at Muji and Nike, in part because a limited number are allowed inside.
Inside COS, a London-based fashion store down the street from Zara, customers are warned that the salespeople can't fetch them different sizes and that they have to turn in their try-ons for a steam-cleaning afterwards. But at least they can use the fitting rooms, which just re-opened.
At Geomania, a small jewellery, gems and crystals shop that's been on Robson since 2003, owner Echo Guo said that business has been slowly picking up. After being closed for three months early in the pandemic, the store got to almost 70 per cent of usual sales during the summer, and is now at a little bit more than 50 per cent.
"There's still customers. No tourists, but we have local customers."
Downtown destination streets such as Robson and Queen West, along with Water St. in St. John's, and Rue Ste. Catherine in Montreal - have been slammed by the COVID-19 pandemic. They tend to rely more on out-of-area visitors and office workers, according to a recent report by the Canadian Urban Institute, which has made them more vulnerable in the pandemic.
(Some commercial streets, particularly those in dense, cohesive residential neighbourhoods, have fared better.)
"There's a lot of COVID economic Darwinism going on," says Brian Kelcey, a consultant on urban public policy who has been working with private and government groups on pandemic survival. "Queen West has been killed. Part of it is the rental dynamic, where the businesses that were doing really well before the crash were paying higher rents, but someone in a crappy storefront that never had many seats, or one with a window that opens to the sidewalk, is doing okay."
These high streets have always been seen as barometers of urban public life and retail health. They were already facing pressure, with increased competition from Amazon, as well as quick delivery food options and casual eateries. Now everyone is watching closely to see what happens next. Will they survive and re-emerge, or will they be transformed into something less than what they once were?
The numbers tell of the struggle for survival. A walking count in late October along eight of Robson's key blocks, from Robson Square in the east to Denman Street in the west, found 29 street-facing storefronts that were unoccupied out of 211 total (though some may have predated the pandemic). Visitor traffic has yet to recover. The street's busiest block saw more than half a million visitors in each of July and August, 2019; this summer, the numbers were closer to 235,000, according to the Robson Street Business Association.
In Toronto, on one particularly dire block of Queen West, only two of the 13 storefronts were open: a restaurant and a plant store. On another block, three of the nine storefronts were cannabis shops.
According to the Queen West Business Improvement Association, on one stretch, between Bathurst Street and Simcoe Street, which links Queen to the Ontario College of Art and Design and the Art Gallery of Ontario, there were 64 vacancies as of October, versus 32 in May. Jones Lang LaSalle Inc., a real estate services firm, says the vacancy rate doubled to 18 per cent over the course of the pandemic on the area from Spadina Avenue to John Street. Three cannabis stores have opened on that stretch; landlords believe they'll be able to pay the rent through a recession.
Robson may be faring somewhat better because more people live nearby. An analysis of the populations within a 400-metre walking distance of the two streets, done by Vancouver census analyst and mathematician Jens von Bergmann, shows that about two and a half times as many people live in the "walk shed" around the main stretch of Robson compared with a similar strip on Queen.
Rents are coming down on both streets, as landlords hope to breathe new life into the retail landscape. Robson has been among the most expensive streets in Canada, with rents up to $250 a square foot; a recent advertisement for one space in a prime block advertised it at $80 a square foot.
On Queen West, the average asking net rent has dropped from nearly $112 a square foot pre-pandemic to below $100 in the third quarter, according to JLL.
And some new businesses are moving in. Nine of the unoccupied spots on that eight-block stretch of Robson had signs promising new retailers. A large and swish new Foot Locker is behind the hoarding in one recently constructed building. Elsewhere are Oomomo, a Japanese housewares store; Paul Bakery, an operation that has been trying to open for a year but is still struggling with Vancouver's difficult permit process; three Asian restaurants, including Katsuya, Ramen Koika and Saku; and a Hello Nori.
"This is our first location that's not in a mall," says Betty Au, the vice-president of operations at Oomomo, a national chain based in Richmond, B.C.
She'd decided a year ago to move this outlet from a mall in Chinatown, hoping to capitalize on the greater pedestrian traffic on Robson and the store's proximity to a mini-Japan cluster (Muji, Uncle Tetsu's Cheesecake and Hello Nori are on the same block). She believes having a street storefront will pay off even more now. "I would say people aren't heading into the mall these days."
Brokers say some new leases are getting signed after the dead months of the pandemic. "The demand for retail space has actually gone up," says Mario Negris, a broker with CBRE who specializes in Robson Street commercial. "Last week, I had two tours of groups from Toronto - it's the first time I've had two tours since March." Of 10 properties in his portfolio, he says four that were vacant before the pandemic have now been leased, and four that became vacant in the months after lockdowns started have also been leased.
By early November, with the pandemic in its second wave, Mr. Negris was still hopeful. "Everyone's thinking this is just a speed bump in the road," he said, pointing out that, given the city's approvals process, anyone signing a lease now won't be open for nine months or so.
Even though vacancies are rising on Queen, JLL's senior vice-president of retail, Brandon Gorman, says some new leases have been signed, including Chick-fil-A and Knix, an underwear store that's moving into a larger space. Retailer Brandy Melville just bought its own property. "We have seen retail sales recover faster on the street versus the malls, with shoppers showing more desire to shop on the street versus in an enclosed environment," he says.
But with Vancouver and Toronto going back into lockdown amid record high COVID-19 cases, more retailers will suffer and be forced to close permanently.
"The bloodbath has not started yet," says Robert Sysak, the neighbourhood director for the West Queen West Business Improvement Association, adding that if restaurants close again, "they will definitely be gone."
Brian Kelcey, the urban policy consultant, says the key to recovery for high streets will be for cities to cut the costs and administrative burdens for business. Canadian businesses say they face cumbersome and expensive hurdles at city halls, including arcane and time-consuming permit processes and exceptionally high property taxes in places with a lot of redevelopment, like Toronto and Vancouver.
Mr. Kelcey says he expects as many as a third of businesses in these areas to be wiped out by the pandemic and contends that cities need to rethink how to foster new ones to take their place. Programs like rent relief and wage subsidies are Band-Aid solutions that won't fix those larger issues.
"These businesses need help, but we don't want to find ourselves spending money without fixing the long-term problem."
Some foresee a change in the kinds of businesses that will populate these once high-rent streets. Shopping streets have already been seeing a shift. Services and restaurants had been increasingly replacing stores selling merchandise. Temporary pop-ups, or multiple businesses sharing a space, were starting to enter the landscape as a way of filling storefronts. Retail was trending to the cheap and the quick.
On Queen, Nunu Ethiopian, a fine-dining restaurant that has been in business for 12 years, is having a hard time. The food is not associated with takeout, and the restaurant has lost most of its revenue. The owners, a husband and wife team, don't know if they'll make it to the other side of the pandemic.
"At the moment, we really don't know what we will do," says Chris Rampen, who co-owns the restaurant with his chef wife.
"How we will survive, I have no idea. If we manage to survive, I gather the market will be less competitive." They got rent relief but did not qualify for wage subsidies.
Mr. Rampen, looking at the changes on Queen West and beyond, worries the city will turn into a conglomerate of chain stores. "You don't go to a major city to dine at McDonalds or A&W or Tim Hortons. I fear we will rapidly become a city of fastfood chains and pot dispensaries. That seems to be the way we are going."
The West Queen West BIA's Mr. Sysak says the street, as well as the city's vibrancy, will fade if most of the retail is replaced with chain and cannabis stores. "There's nothing wrong with Shoppers, Rexall and cannabis shops. If that is all there is, that is the magic that will be lost," he says.
Businesses that are still operating have had to adapt to the new realities. It's not just face masks and decals on the ground showing people where to stand.
Peter Pan, a hot spot for first dates with its large corner windows, is now Peter Pantry & Wine. Rows of wine bottles, and shelves of jams and sauces, have replaced the tables with the best views, and the owners are changing their menu to prepackaged meals. Noce, a popular Italian restaurant, started doing takeout for the first time and erected a large white tarp tent on the side street for seated dining.
The Horseshoe is changing to a full-service music lounge, as it used to be in the 1970s, with no standing room. Concertgoers will be seated at tables, able to order wine by the bottle and drink it in wine glasses, not cups. Owner Jeff Cohen expects the price of admission to triple because the venue will no longer be able to fit as many people. There will be no opening acts, and bands will start and end earlier, playing a few sets instead of just one. "We don't have a choice," he says, adding he's not fighting the changes but embracing them. "We are going back to the way it was before."

Why San Jose should shine in a postpandemic world: FUTURE OF CITIES

Full text: When it comes to major American cities, San Jose, Calif., has long had an inferiority complex.
The 10th largest city in the U.S., with more than a million residents, San Jose lives in the perennial shadow of San Francisco, its smaller, but far more famous neighbour located an hour to the north.
San Francisco has iconic parks, cable cars, world-famous architecture and an array of Michelinstarred restaurants that have drawn waves of young workers and the headquarters of firms such as Uber Technologies Inc., Twitter Inc., AirBnb and Slack Technologies Inc. It so dominates the region's psyche that Bay Area locals simply refer to it as "The City."
San Jose, meanwhile, is where shuttle buses drop workers at the suburban campuses of well-established computer giants such as Cisco Systems Inc. and Adobe Inc. It has dubbed itself the Capital of Silicon Valley, though the municipality is better known as a place where families go for good schools, single-family homes with large backyards and ample parking at shopping malls.
But the pandemic has upended conventional wisdom about the benefits of living in densely packed, transit-oriented cities.
Throngs of San Francisco's workfrom-anywhere tech employees have fled their cramped apartments for vacation destinations like Lake Tahoe and Hawaii.
Rents for studio apartments in the city have plunged roughly 30 per cent since the start of the pandemic, according to online real estate firm Zillow.
The aftermath of COVID-19 may turn out to be San Jose's moment to shine. Earlier this year, Moody's Corp. ranked it among the 10 American cities best positioned to weather the pandemic.
The list took into account the city's educated work force, its concentration of high-tech employment and the allure of its carcentric neighbourhoods and relatively low population density.
San Jose joined other postpandemic superstars on Moody's ranking including Salt Lake City, Utah and Boise, Idaho. Those locations are rarely thought of as global tourist destinations, but cities such as New York, Miami and Los Angeles - whose economies rely more heavily on hospitality, tourism and small businesses - fared poorly in the analysis.
In a vote of confidence for the future of urban living, last month Alphabet Inc.'s Google unveiled designs for a sprawling complex in San Jose's downtown. The urban village, adjacent to the city's main transit hub, is expected to include 4,000 homes, 10 parks, shopping and hotels, and office space for roughly 25,000 employees, all fuelled by an on-site, solar-powered microgrid. The project is part of a massive construction boom that is expected to transform roughly 100 hectares of San Jose's sleepy city centre.
Civic leaders wasted no time in celebrating the city's success. This fall, they unveiled the finalists in a competition to design the world's next iconic landmark.
The project's organizers said the winning sculpture, destined for a downtown San Jose park, would celebrate Silicon Valley's innovation while combining "the spirit of the Eiffel Tower with the breathtaking gift of the Statue of Liberty."
Not everyone is happy with San Jose's coming of age. The San Jose Sharks NHL team, whose arena sits in the middle of the planned downtown construction, threatened to relocate this month, citing concerns that included a lack of parking.
San Jose's mayor, Sam Liccardo, suggested that professional sports teams - which have been hard hit by the pandemic-related shutdowns - should be so lucky to face a future where even more local residents will live within walking distance of their games.
"In any dynamic, revitalizing downtown on this planet, the universal mantra applies," he told The San Jose Mercury News this week: "Pardon the dust."

Full text: Given that Twitter Inc. has offices around the world, Jen Wilson always assumed that if she ever left Toronto, she'd be moving somewhere like New York or London - certainly not Halifax, about an hour away from where she grew up, near Lunenburg.
But the COVID-19 pandemic has changed a lot of people's plans. Ms. Wilson gave birth to her first son, Finnley, in February. In March, provincial borders began to close just as her mother was booked to visit her grandson for the first time. Ms. Wilson, who is Twitter's global head of standards for curating tweets, learned at the same time - via Twitter, of course - that her company was ramping up its remotework policy.
Ms. Wilson and her husband, Alex Piitz, a personal trainer and academic researcher, were suddenly presented with an opportunity they hadn't considered before: If all of a sudden we don't have to be in Toronto, she recalls thinking, do we still want to be here? Toronto's commute was rough, and there was no backyard for Finnley. Halifax was the first alternative to cross her mind. Her brother was there, her mom was nearby, and it was still a city kind of city. She could have the best of both worlds: amenities close by and, unlike her Toronto townhouse, a yard.
"If I don't need to commute, I don't want to be in a bedroom community," she says.
"We love living in the city - we love being able to go out for walks in the morning to get a coffee, but also have easy access to running."
In September, Ms. Wilson and Finnley flew across the country to move into a house she'd only seen in video calls.
As it stretches into its 11th month, the COVID-19 pandemic will likely keep changing the cities we live in, especially as longtime urbanites like Ms. Wilson become unmoored from physical offices. This shift could transform not just massive urban centres filled with corporate headquarters, but mid-sized cities, too. That change is already abundantly clear in Halifax, where a real estate boom is under way, prospective home-buyers now face bidding wars, and the rental and affordable housing markets are feeling the squeeze.
Despite those tensions, some community leaders see this as a generational opportunity to transform cities like Halifax with an influx of talent, creativity and the economic spinoff they can provide. The Halifax Partnership economic development agency is coming up with strategies to seize on this interest, hoping the surge in remote work will accelerate its long-term plan to raise the city's population to 550,000 from 440,000 by 2031 and boost its economic output by nearly 50 per cent, to $30-billion.
"COVID has shone a light on our comparative advantages to other jurisdictions," says Wendy Luther, the agency's chief executive officer. She has bold ambitions for a postpandemic Halifax. "A realistic scenario is that Halifax becomes the most attractive city for talent on the eastern seaboard of North America coming out of this pandemic."
Ms. Wilson and Mr. Piitz found lots of interesting listings when they started scouring for homes in May. But by July, houses had started selling much faster. Since they were still living in Toronto, they couldn't just hop on a plane to check out places because of mandatory quarantine restrictions that were helping keep cases in the "Atlantic Bubble" so low. Instead, they had Ms. Wilson's brother conduct video tours of half a dozen homes.
The first house they saw sparked a bidding war, and they began to worry about missing out. After virtually visiting a South End home they loved (though Mr. Piitz missed much of the tour because of a Finnley diaper emergency), they put in an offer less than 24 hours later, though they'd never set foot inside and had no sense of whether their furniture might even fit.
Their experience was hardly unique: Despite a drop in sales during the pandemic's first two months, seasonally adjusted average house prices have climbed 13 per cent in Halifax since the start of the year, to $383,136 at the end of September. The broader Canadian market has seen a bump of 15 per cent so far this year. Though such nationwide increases were historically driven by Toronto and Vancouver, the Canadian Real Estate Association's early interpretation of the data suggests values are rising everywhere as home-buyers seek larger ground-level properties.
The Halifax market had already been on the upswing. Unadjusted year-over-year prices in Halifax jumped 6.9 per cent from 2018 to 2019 - then the highest jump in a decade, according to CREA - while vacancies for two-bedroom apartments fell to a record-low rate of 0.9 per cent. But the pandemic has made the market hotter still, says Keller Williams realtor Jerry Lynds, who focuses on buyers.
"Gone are the days when a buyer could rush in an offer to try and secure a home," Mr. Lynds says. "Now you're competing almost every single time. That's a big shocker to a lot of people here. You feel like you can't negotiate any more."
Mr. Lynds believes historically low interest rates are exaggerating demand. So are out-of-province buyers. Halifax had already broken population growth records in each of the past four years, bringing in 9,747 newcomers in 2019 alone - 83 per cent of them from outside Nova Scotia, according to the Halifax Partnership. Now, many of them are coming armed with remote-work allowances, big-city salaries and equity they've pulled from homes in hotter markets.
Since the pandemic began, Mr. Lynds estimates that nearly a third of his clients now come from outside Nova Scotia, up from about 15 per cent.
The writer, illustrator and cartoonist Kate Leth returned to Halifax in September after five years in Los Angeles, hoping to be closer to her mom and to escape the United States as it underwent simultaneous crises over the coronavirus, civil rights and President Donald Trump.
"The amount of anxiety I don't feel every single second, like I did in America, is shocking," she said over lunch at a Quinpool Rd. diner in mid-October. But the Halifax she returned to came with a shock of its own. Finding an apartment was much different than it had been five years earlier.
Ms. Leth set alerts on multiple apps, eventually securing an apartment through Facebook Marketplace by responding to a listing two minutes after it was posted. It costs as much as her most recent L.A.
apartment, but in Canadian dollars. "I thought getting a place in Burbank was hard," she says.
This has inevitably put pressure on lower-income Haligonians. There's no rent control in the city, though pressure is on the province to enact such a rule, fuelled by recent protests. Local media report some residents are seeing monthly rent increases of as much as 90 per cent. Other longtime lower-income renters are being evicted so landlords can renovate and flip units.
Halifax desperately needs more housing, and many of its oldest apartments are "appalling," says Hannah Wood, chair of the Halifax central-peninsula chapter of the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now tenants' union, or ACORN. Minimal insulation and rat problems are not uncommon in some neighbourhoods, with issues even worse in public housing, she adds.
But the arrival of new-build housing - along with the amenities its residents attract - tends to prompt gentrification, driving away long-time residents of neighbourhoods such as Halifax's North End. According to the One North End Community Economic Development Society, the Black population there fell by half between 2006 and 2016.
Rodney Small's grandmother lived in Africville, the Black community destroyed in the 1960s to make room for a bridge to Dartmouth; his own racial profiling by a police officer in the 1990s prompted a landmark Supreme Court decision that confirmed judges' ability to consider "social context" such as racism in decisions. In the time since, he has watched Black residents get forced out of the North End because of gentrification.
While Halifax markets itself as a land of opportunity, not everyone who lives there is getting equal access - especially to the economic opportunities in the city's central peninsula. "Blackness is being pushed outside of the peninsula," says Mr. Small, One North End's director.
The pandemic's real estate shifts have put even more pressure on North End residents. While Mr. Small has staked his career on making it an inclusive community - lately he's working with local developers on an inclusive redevelopment of a local school to include arts, start-up and retail spaces for African Nova Scotians - he says governments need to prevent further displacement, including with rent control.
"We need to pass new legislation," he says.
Some developers are trying to accommodate the demand by sprawling beyond the core. Since the pandemic began, Clayton Developments Ltd. has seen more interest in ground-level homes than it has in 30 years, says president Jason Brunt: "It's, ‘Give me enough space to sit in the backyard and have a glass of wine at a fire pit.' " Clayton has started seeking approvals in Lantz, on the other side of Halifax's already far-flung airport, a nearly half-hour drive from downtown.
"We've had that land for over 100 years," Mr. Brunt says. "We decided to trigger it now and to start developing because of this significant demand shift. It's the cra-
ziest momentum we've ever seen."
The city is doing everything it can to leverage the pandemic into an economic boom. "We're now targeting companies that have made announcements, or made it known through our conversations, of their intention to grow a remote work force - and highlighting for them the talent we have in Halifax and Nova Scotia," says the Halifax Partnership's CEO, Ms. Luther.
The agency has a list of benefits to trot out to prospective employers considering scouring the Halifax region for remote talent. Ms. Luther's team will point them to the pipeline of talent from seven postsecondary institutions; Halifax's openness to international immigrants, who accounted for two-thirds of its nearly 10,000 new residents in 2019; its relaxed lifestyle; and its relative affordability - for now, anyway - compared with cities such as Toronto and Vancouver.
Included in these conversations are ecommerce giant Shopify Inc. - which recently implemented a "digital-by-default" policy - and NPower, a Brooklyn-based non-profit dedicated to digital skills training, to encourage people to come to the city to work, remotely or otherwise. The Toronto literary platform Wattpad Corp.
announced a new Halifax office, too, which opened before the pandemic.
Shopify is eagerly looking at markets like Halifax since adopting its remotefriendly work policy in May. "We can now attract and hire the best talent, regardless of where they're located, including midsized Canadian markets such as Halifax," says Crystal Hunt, a diversity and belonging specialist at Shopify who has been working with Nova Scotia Business Inc., the Partnership's provincial counterpart.
"We've seen strong interest from candidates across Canada, particularly in regions where we didn't have offices previously."
The economic development agency is also dovetailing its tourism and immigration marketing strategies. Sitting in a conference room overlooking historic Citadel Hill, Ms. Luther points out that tourism can be the first step in recruiting new Haligonians. Sometimes, she says, the message is as simple as, "If you can work from anywhere, here is where you need to be."
Ms. Luther's team also hopes to expand a program that tries to keep new graduates and immigrants in the city by connecting them with local business leaders. One stream of the program focuses on finding opportunities for African Nova Scotians.
An issue Halifax will have to grapple with - like any other city - is the pandemic's toll on long-time Haligonians and the businesses already in their backyard. Nearly 10 per cent of workers lost their jobs between February and May. And the Conference Board of Canada, in its October survey of major cities, forecast that its gross domestic product will fall 4.7 per cent in real terms this year. But the think tank also sees a strong rebound next year, with 5.8 per cent real GDP growth. Those forecasts are both better than the Conference Board's Canada-wide prognosis for this year's decline (6.6 per cent) and next year's rebound (5.6 per cent).
It's possible, too, that remote-work migration won't end up being all that significant. "This has been the promise here since 2008, when the region had an advantage with fibre technology," says Herb Emery, the Fredericton-based University of New Brunswick Vaughan Chair in Regional Economics. "We have too much tied up in existing structures and capital in [major] cities."
Dr. Emery says the structural problems that plague the Maritimes - such as the lack of family doctors in many regions and low vacancy rates in Halifax - are likely to give some potential new residents pause.
He's waiting for migration statistics to prove out the thesis. "I'm still a bit perplexed about the time scale for all this transformation," he says. "It's only been eight months."
When Ms. Leth left five years ago, downtown "felt like it was on a decline," in part because construction on the Nova Centre - home to Ms. Luther's office - was plagued by development delays that choked out local businesses and creative and cultural spaces. It was completed in 2017; Ms. Leth is among those hoping for something of a renaissance. "All the people I know moving back are creative people, either writers or artists," she says.
Ms. Wilson, meanwhile, is adjusting quickly to the perks of Halifax. She has a yard and is thrilled to be near her mom.
"She watched Finn for the first time anyone else had watched him in his entire life," Ms. Wilson said on a drizzly mid-October day, sitting outside a South End coffee shop.
Her mom babysat Finnley for a practical reason: Ms. Wilson and her husband had to go replace their car's Ontario plates, which tend to raise eyebrows in the Atlantic region these days. But it also made the move that much more real. "At the beginning of the year," she says, "I never would have thought the end of the year would find us here."

Full text: When Ontario liquor laws temporarily changed to allow restaurants to sell wine with takeaway and delivery orders, executive chef Ryan Crawford promptly removed some banquettes at his Niagara-onthe-Lake restaurant to make the wine cellar more accessible to customers. The bottles - adorned with new price tags - range from a popular selection of under$30 reds and whites to expensive vintages from Bordeaux, Burgundy and California that ring up at $150 or more.
Now that those regulations, which are set to expire Dec. 31, are under review by the Doug Ford government to potentially become permanent, Crawford is planning to add to the selection and include what he's calling "Niagara's Top 100" wines. "I want to expand the representation of the quality wines made right here," he says.
Crawford has also changed the way he runs his business to stay afloat during the COVID-19 pandemic. He has reinvented his farm-to-table restaurant, Backhouse, as Ruffino's Pasta & Grille, expanding a popup concept he has operated during winter months. In addition, he stocks a selection of groceries as part of its "supermercato."
"It helps," Crawford says. "We're able to sell an extra bottle of wine to a customer who dined with us to take home with them or add to a takeout order. But it's only going to be a major benefit if we can get these wines at wholesale prices. We cannot compete with local wineries or the LCBO on price."
Currently before the Ontario Legislature, the Main Street Recovery Plan and Main Street Recovery Act, 2020, are designed to assist businesses hardest hit by the shutdowns. They commit "to exploring options to permanently allow licensed restaurants and bars to include alcohol with food as part of a takeout or delivery order before the existing regulation expires."
If the plans are approved, securing wholesale prices will be key for the longterm viability of restaurants operating bodega-style bottle shops, agrees Krysta Oben, general manager of Paris Paris wine bar in Toronto. "It's crucial to the sustainability of robust and profitable shops going forward."
She's grateful for the relaxed regulations thus far, calling them "a real lifesaver."
Without a big patio or strong Uber Eats presence, operating as a bottle shop has been critical for business. "It's been good for us and for many others, I know, like Midfield and Piquette," she says, naming two other west-end wine bars. "I really hope it stays. It's not like restaurants are suddenly going to be fine on Jan. 1."
Oben is also a partner of Grape Witches, an events and tasting business she founded with Nicole Campbell. It expanded to become a wine club and import agency, and has been operating Grape Glass, a shop that specializes in organic and biodynamic bottles for the past two months.
The duo originally leased the storefront on Dundas Street West on March 7 to be an events and office space, but when restaurants were given the go ahead to sell wine, they changed plans to accommodate retail. The shop has already attracted considerable foot traffic from the neighbourhood, Oben says, as well as online orders from beyond the downtown core. It features a rotating range of wines that normally would be available only at a restaurant or when purchased direct from an agent. A small menu changes weekly, as Grape Witches collaborates with different chefs to offer takeaway sandwiches and other dishes.
"It's been busy. People are very thirsty these days," Oben says lightheartedly.
Another sommelier excited about retail opportunities is Heather McDougall. The former general manager of Montecito joined forces with master sommelier Bruce Wallner's Grand Cru Deli to create Sips Toronto. She set herself a task to add in-store and online wine sales to the existing wine bar and its associated school, SommFactory.
"No one is getting rich off of bottle shops," McDougall says. "It's about cash flow. You buy product, sell it quickly and reinvest."
But, she adds, selling wine this way allows restaurants to foster a relationship with customers so they keep returning.
"That's where sommeliers can put their skills, training and abilities to good use.
The retail environment affords the opportunity to do what I was doing table by table in a 60-seat restaurant to a larger audience.
I can share what's happening in the world of wine more loudly and more broadly this way. I see nothing but upside."
She's busily improving the SipsToronto website to promote online sales to vinophiles across Ontario. "We need to talk to everyone who buys wine, not just in a 20block radius of our shop downtown. We're marketing to the entire province."
This week's recommendations include a collectable red from one of Chile's leading wineries, a crowd-pleasing pinot noir from New Zealand and an affordable chardonnay made from organic grapes grown in Argentina.
BOTTLES TO TRY ARGENTO SELECCION CHARDONNAY 2019 (ARGENTINA) SCORE: 88 PRICE: $11.50 Consultant Alberto Antonini has helped Argento become a leading organic grape grower, with an increasing interest in organic wine-making as well. This ripe and rich style of chardonnay makes the most of its mix of citrus, peach and tropical fruit with oak spice and honeyed notes.
Drink now to 2022. Available in Ontario.
INVIVO CENTRAL OTAGO PINOT NOIR 2018 (NEW ZEALAND) SCORE: 90 PRICE: $24.95 This juicy pinot noir offers nice spicy oak and earthy complexity alongside a core of cherry and blackberry fruit.
This is ripe and powerful stuff for pinot, which makes it an appealing style for the masses. Drink now to 2024.
Available in Ontario at the above price, various prices in Alberta, $25.40 in Quebec.
VINA MONTES PURPLE ANGEL 2017 (CHILE) SCORE: 93 PRICE: $69.95 The new vintage of Montes's Purple Angel offers impressive concentration with bright fruit, plush texture and a long finish. It is mostly carménère with some petit verdot from vineyards in Chile's Colchagua Valley. A full-bodied and age-worthy wine that will appeal to fans of blockbuster styles, this is just hitting its stride. Decant for best enjoyment if you're planning to consume soon. Drink 2022 to 2030. Available in Ontario at the above price, $88.99 in British Columbia, various prices in Alberta, $80.16 in Manitoba, $69.75 in Quebec, $69.99 in New Brunswick, various prices in Nova Scotia, $66.29 in Prince Edward Island.

The Maritimes are changin': Why homeowner hopefuls are looking east

Full text: THE LISTING Despairing of ever being able to afford a home in Toronto, Madeline Taylor, 24, and Mitchell Kingsley, 25, cast their gaze east.
"We were looking at 15 years of saving for a detached home in Toronto; that's when we started to look for other options," Ms. Taylor said.
What they ended up buying was a 225-acre forested property with its own lake and a cabin, too - all for less than $200,000.
Ms. Taylor and Mr. Kingsley grew up in tiny Flesherton, Ont., population 584. Both went to the University of Toronto and got good jobs in the city too - Mr. Kingsley is a software engineer at a hardware startup, Ms. Taylor works in digital marketing - but they felt the future looked bleak.
Even tiny Flesherton was too rich. A family friend told them of a bungalow that might once have sold for $250,000 that was selling for $900,000. "We were looking at something a bit bigger; we discovered there was no way to for us to buy a piece of property. Even though we had good jobs, we've done the thing we were supposed to do, we could never get ahead," Ms. Taylor said.
After visiting Mr. Kingsley's parents and sister, who had moved to Sussex, N.B., in the centre of the province, they began to search local listings. Ms. Taylor said she had mused over 10 other properties when she saw what locals call a "camp" about a fourminute drive from the Hopewell Rocks on the Bay of Fundy. The land had a seven-year-old cabin on site, and had been on the market for more than two years. They never saw it in person; Mr. Kingsley's father took a tour in late 2019 and made a positive review.
The couple put in an offer and closed the deal in early February.
New Brunswick had the fastest-growing real estate market in the country in September, and it's drawing the eyes of Ontario and international buyers looking to cash out and slow down for a simpler life on the east coast.
According to The Canadian Real Estate Association, home sales in September were up 45.9 per cent across Canada, but the fastest growing market was New Brunswick, which saw a 33-percent increase in sales from a year ago. The province still has the lowest average home prices in the country, even with the burst in activity that pushed the average selling price to a new record of $226,959 - up 31.4 per cent from $172,491 a year earlier.
Ms. Taylor and Mr. Kingsley's mortgage carrying costs for their slice of Acadian wilderness are less than half the $1,300 a month rent they were paying for a Parkdale basement apartment (sharing the building with two other apartments and five more people working from home).
"We were looking at it partly as something we could start investing in. We also played around with the idea of building some short-term-rental boutique cabins ... we always pictured [moving there] would be a few years down the road," Mr. Kingsley said.
What they didn't expect was to move there so soon. As they were preparing for closing, news of a novel coronavirus bubbled up into their consciousness.
"This sounds end of the world.
If it gets bad we should pack up the car and go live in the cabin," Mr. Kingsley said in jest at the time. When they were both told to work from home, that possibility became real, and they drove down in the spring.
"When the deal for the cabin closed, we booked some [return] flights for June or July, and we never ended up needing those tickets," Ms. Taylor said.
"In the past year or so, we've seen a surge in the demand," said André Malenfant, sales manager with Exit Realty Associates in Dieppe, N.B. "There's a lot of people from Ontario, newcomers, people never lived here before.
The craziness of COVID and the confinement, made a lot of people think about their life, where they are with it, and where they want to go."
Mr. Malenfant, who was recently elected president of the New Brunswick Real Estate Association, said they also have a large number of returning buyers. "We also have people coming back.
They work [out of province] for many, many years, and are looking at pre-retirement or retirement."
"It is mostly people from Ontario," said Jennifer Jones, sales representative with Royal LePage Atlantic in Moncton, who said she's used to sellers being happy if they get 90 per cent of their asking price after three months on the market. "In the last week, I probably closed four of five deals with people coming from Ontario, and they are buying sight unseen.
"It's usually been a buyer's market here," she said. "Ever since I started [15 years ago], buyers were pretty much in control. Now it's flipped. I just sold a house for $60,000 in Port Elgin - there was a bidding war. There's a lot of bidding wars happening now that didn't happen before."
Even a busy market starts at a relatively low base in a province with 747,101 people and 319,773 private homes (as of the 2016 census): New Brunswick set a September sales record with 1,157 transactions, up 33 per cent from 2019. So far in 2020, a record 7,953 homes sold, up 7.3 per cent from 2019. Year to date, that's several thousand fewer transactions than the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board recorded just in October.
Even cold-eyed economists are casting covetous eyes at Maritimes real estate. "I've been saying to my wife for years ... why don't we move to Cape Breton?" said Shaun Cathcart, senior economist at CREA, noting that many white-collar professionals working from home have suddenly found themselves free of geographical constraints.
"You can buy a house in Ottawa, hold it for one year and sell it, that's enough equity to buy one of those houses in New Brunswick."
Mr. Cathcart says New Brunswick's price rises aren't entirely about surging Ontario interest; it's also about a years-long and national trend of the existing inventory of homes being absorbed. "We've been moving in this direction for a long time, but the price growth component of it in New Brunswick hadn't taken off," he said.
As to why sellers would sit out a surging market and decline to list their home, Mr. Cathcart offers one anecdotal reason: "If you think about older folks looking at long-term care [and selling their houses] how much of that is happening now? None."
Moving to the Maritimes bubble is not as simple as packing up the car. There's the two-week quarantine and then you might find yourself surprised by the neighbourhood. Mr. Malenfant recalls one couple buying a dream home in a fishing village, only to realize a working port was a little less picturesque than their imagination.
"We're just taking it day-byday. We really love New Brunswick," said Ms. Taylor, whose latest project is to build up a socialmedia presence on Instagram and TikTok, calling their home The Outpost. They plan to build a tiny-home-style cabin over the winter for future renters.
"I miss my family, this is the longest time I've ever been away from them," she said. "But we've gotten to know all of our neighbours, and we're quite close to a few of them. I lived in a condo building for three years and never knew my neighbours. It's been a bit of a whirlwind, a lot of unknowns ... we're flying by the seat of our pants."

Full text: Four years ago, Chey Tor reluctantly cast a ballot for Donald Trump. A lifelong Republican from Scottsdale, Ariz., Mr. Tor had his reservations about the New York developer but thought a businessman and Washington outsider could do some good for the country.
This year however, the 39-yearold realtor switched his registration to Democrat and voted for Joe Biden, forming part of a wave of moderate voters in Arizona whose shifting allegiances appear to be helping to tip the traditionally Republican state into Democratic hands for the first time in decades.
"We've had an amazing four years economically. But socially it's been a complete, complete disaster," Mr. Tor said.
"I'd rather go back to the ways that people are more cordial, more polite."
Mr. Biden won the presidency by rebuilding the "blue wall" of Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, historically Democraticvoting states that backed Mr. Trump in 2016. But this election showed that another story is playing out in traditionally Republican states of the American Southwest such as Arizona, where Democrats saw strong support in urban centres and both parties fought a fierce battle for the fastgrowing suburbs.
Votes were still being tallied in Arizona on Monday, though Mr. Biden retained a 0.5-percentagepoint lead.
The Trump campaign sued Arizona on the weekend, alleging voting irregularities in Maricopa County, the state's most populous region.
The lawsuit is part of a series of court challenges Mr. Trump launched in a handful of states, refusing to concede the election until all his legal options are exhausted. Trump supporters took to the streets of Phoenix to protest the results of the election in Arizona.
Regardless of the final outcome of the vote in Arizona, Democrats celebrated some outright gains in the state. Arizona will send two Democrats to the U.S. Senate for the first time in nearly 70 years after voters backed former astronaut Mark Kelly over Republican incumbent Martha McSally. He will join Democrat Kyrsten Sinema, elected in a close Senate race in 2018.
Arizonans also approved ballot propositions legalizing recreational cannabis and raising taxes on high-income earners to pay for education, despite strong opposition to both measures from the state's Republican leadership.
"I literally cried tears of joy" at the election results, said Biden voter Rose French, 41, as she stood across from the state legislature in Phoenix on Saturday in a T-shirt of the late Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, watching as several hundred Trump supporters protested.
Ms. French and her husband, Donald Smith, 54, are both music professors at two local community colleges, which they say are badly in need of the funding that is expected to come from taxes on newly legalized recreational cannabis.
The couple, who live in downtown Phoenix, have waited years for Arizona to turn blue in a presidential election, Mr. Smith said.
He credits surging population growth in the city, where a spate of new public-transit projects, high-rise residential construction and an expansion of the downtown campus of Arizona State University has brought new residents into the city's core.
"I'm old enough to remember when downtown Phoenix was a ghost town," he said. "Now there's a lot of good restaurants and lots of nightlife. A whole lot of people are moving down here.
Downtown is booming. And it's overwhelmingly blue."
Preliminary results from the state suggest that more Democratic voters than Republicans turned out in Arizona's largest, most urban and fastest-growing regions, such as Maricopa County - home to Phoenix, Mesa, Scottsdale and Tempe - as well as Pima County, which includes Tucson.
Mr. Trump managed to boost his share of the vote in Republican strongholds of the state that are home to smaller cities and more rural areas that have not grown as quickly, said Samara Klar, a political scientist at the University of Arizona.
"One of the biggest factors is just the urbanization of the state, with more and more people leaving rural areas and more and more people entering urban areas," she said. "The rural areas where Trump is gaining ground in Arizona are losing voters and the urban areas where Joe Biden is gaining ground are gaining voters."
Arizona added almost 700,000 registered voters between 2016 and 2020 thanks in part to an influx of new residents from states such as California, New York, Illinois and Washington, drawn by affordable homes, ample jobs and low taxes. Mr. Tor, a real estate agent, said home sales in the Phoenix area have been brisk despite the pandemic because of low interest rates and continued demand from people moving into the region.
Ben Enos, 29, moved to Phoenix from San Francisco three months ago to attend law school at Arizona State University, deliberately switching his voter registration from California to Arizona. "I knew it was going to be close, but here I could actually make an impact," he said. "I wasn't too worried about California."
Mr. Trump narrowly won Arizona's suburbs according to AP VoteCast, a national survey of voters by the Associated Press.
But that support came primarily from white suburban voters without a college degree, who backed the Republican nominee 54 per cent. Mr. Biden won 56 per cent of non-white suburban voters and 53 per cent of collegeeducated suburbanites in Arizona.
The state also saw a jump in turnout among independent voters, who overwhelmingly backed Mr. Biden. While the overall share of voters who registered as independents didn't change much between 2016 and this year - roughly 30 per cent of Arizona voters call themselves independents - the number who actually cast a ballot appeared to more than triple, from 82,000 in 2016 to nearly 300,000 this year. That suggests a surge in independents who either didn't vote in 2016, or who have only recently moved into the state, Prof. Klar said.
Mr. Biden also appeared to do slightly better with seniors than Democrats have done in the past in Arizona, earning 46 per cent of the vote among those aged 65 and older, according to AP VoteCast.
Biden supporter Steve Jennings, 69, who works as director of advocacy for the Arizona offices of AARP, a lobby group for those over 50, said local seniors seemed particularly concerned about the Trump campaign's approach to COVID-19. They frequently called into telephone town halls that his organization held with election candidates to raise concerns about why Mr. Trump's rallies didn't require attendees to wear face coverings or enforce physical distancing.
"They were saying: ‘Why aren't they wearing masks? Why isn't there a mask mandate?' That would come up again and again," he said. "I'm not sure his rallies didn't backfire with him that way with older voters."
Still, the extraordinarily close election results suggest Arizona remains firmly in battleground territory and point to challenges that Mr. Biden is likely to face in trying to unite a deeply polarized country.
Trump supporters in Arizona question how Mr. Biden could have possibly won such a traditionally conservative state, especially since Mr. Trump turned out far more supporters at several rallies he held in Arizona than Mr. Biden did for his lone campaign visit to the state. Such questions have fuelled a belief among Trump supporters that Mr. Biden's strong showing in Arizona is a result of voter fraud, and that Mr. Trump will ultimately win the state.
"We're supposed to believe that this man who can't get 50 to 100 people to a rally took Arizona? It's the media saying ignore the truth, believe what we're saying," said Denise Marie, 56, a graphic designer from Gilbert, a suburb of Phoenix.
A former Democrat who migrated to Mr. Trump after attending several of his rallies in 2016, Ms. Marie said she was looking for ways to organize a public event to demonstrate just how many people still support the Republican President. "Even if Trump doesn't win, he's shaken up this country," she said on Friday afternoon, before the election was officially called for Mr. Biden, but after several media outlets had declared that Mr. Trump lost Arizona.
Republicans in Arizona also managed to keep control of the state legislature and prevailed in a hotly contested congressional race in Maricopa County. And in one troubling sign for Democrats, Mr. Biden received nearly 50,000 fewer votes than Mr. Kelly, the Democratic senator-elect, who campaigned as an independent focused on local Arizona issues.
Mr. Trump also managed to turn out his base in large numbers in Arizona, a sign the partisan divide is alive and well in the United States, said Donald Critchlow, a political historian and Katzin Family Professor at Arizona State University.
"A lot of people want the division healed. But I just don't see it happening unfortunately," he said. "We're just in such a volatile time and this election really didn't settle much." Nor is the election proof that Arizona is inevitably becoming a Democratic stronghold. Mr. Tor said he plans to switch his voter registration from Democrat to independent in future elections. He prefers that Arizona remain a "purple" state, one in which continuing political tensions force conservatives and liberals to find compromises.
"I think Arizona will always be up for grabs," he said. "As long as we stay in that ‘purple state' zone, Arizona will be a great place to be."

Full text: Sarah Laird knows some sellers are unloading their condo units in Toronto's uncertain market, but the owner of a unit on the city's waterfront doesn't intend to get sucked into the panic.
Still, Ms. Laird is clear-eyed about the challenges the condo segment is facing right now: Like many owners, she is trying to figure out the best strategy for selling in a market with surging inventory and hesitant buyers.
Ms. Laird has twice reduced the asking price on her one-plusone-bedroom unit at Pier 27 since listing the unit on Sept. 30.
Her current asking price is $699,000, after starting at $788,800, then reducing to $749,800 two weeks later.
In August, two comparable units in the building at 39 Queen's Quay E. sold for $810,000 and $820,000 respectively.
"Six weeks and the market changed drastically," she says.
Ms. Laird and her partner work in the technology sector in the city's core. The couple had planned to look for a house together in the spring - then the coronavirus pandemic brought the real estate market to a standstill and they put their plans to purchase on hold.
When the market picked up again, they listed her partner's condo at King and Church in July. His unit lacked parking and outdoor space, but within two weeks it had sold.
"That gave us a bit of false confidence," Ms. Laird says.
By comparison, Ms. Laird's unit has parking, a locker and views of Lake Ontario from the balcony. She had been leasing in the boutique building for about one year before she offered to purchase the unit from the owner.
"I loved the feeling of being right on the water and still being able to walk to everything," she says.
When it came time to sell, she had the unit staged and polished, and hung artwork by a local artist.
Despite the effort, the unit had about six showings in a month, she says.
Real estate agent Manu Singh says his feed is laden with suspensions, terminations and price reductions.
"I'm just seeing a ton," says the agent with Right at Home Realty Inc., in Toronto.
During the summer, buyers were keen to pick up one-bedroom units while interest rates were so low, he says.
Heading into the fall, Mr. Singh figures many people were holding off on making decisions to see if people would return to their workplaces and if there would be a second wave of COVID-19 infections.
"I think people have come to realize that, for the forseeable future, it's going to be work-fromhome."
As a result, the market for one-bedroom or smaller units has softened. Renters have returned home to live with their parents, he says, immigration is down and the short-term rental market has dried up with rule changes and a lack of tourism.
In the past two months, Mr. Singh says, the market has been changing weekly as many investors decide to sell. He has been aggressively shifting strategies to keep up.
At 650 Queen's Quay W., he listed Penthouse 18 for sale in September with an asking price of $599,000. He used the common tactic of drawing attention with a low asking price, then holding off offers for seven days.
At 39 Sherbourne St., he tried a similar marketing plan for unit 702, with an asking price of $499,000.
In both cases, bids landed on offer night, but they were lowballs that the sellers did not accept.
"We saw the market shifting beneath our feet," he says. "My investors were caught."
Mr. Singh relisted the Queen's Quay penthouse for $649,000 and sold it for $625,000 after 25 days on market.
The Sherbourne Street unit was relisted for $528,000 and sold for $515,000 after 32 days.
In both cases, the units were vacant, but he used "virtual staging," which portrays the space as it would look with furniture in online images. Mr. Singh thinks this relatively new digital tool is pivotal in attracting potential buyers who are more hesitant to visit in person during the pandemic.
"This way, only serious buyers book an appointment," he says.
Mr. Singh is watching to see if condo listings in downtown Toronto continue to rise at a time of year when they would typically begin to decrease.
"That would signal to me that investors are starting to freak out."
He expects year-over-year price growth - which was still at a healthy 7.7 per cent for condos in the 416 area code in September - to decrease and possibly flatten. If supply remains high and demand weak, prices will likely fall, he says.
"This is the calm before the storm," he says. "It's a lagging indicator. It takes a few months for prices to adjust."
The market for higher-priced units with two-or-more bedrooms is holding up, adds Mr. Singh, because the size allows for two people to work from home.
Buyers in the condo market are behaving very differently in different segments: Samantha and Cheryl Graff of Harvey Kalles Real Estate Ltd. recently listed a unit for $998,000 and sold it five days later for $1.3-million.
Suite 504 provides 1,300 square feet on the top floor of a boutique building at 30 Glen Elm Ave., in midtown near Yonge Street and St. Clair Avenue, says Samantha Graff.
Three bids landed from couples in three stages of life: One offer came from first-time buyers, another from two people moving from a smaller condo, and the prevailing offer from empty nesters who are downsizing.
"It has that home feeling as opposed to a new condo feeling," says Ms. Graff, explaining the unit has a fireplace, two balconies and treetop views.
Cheryl Graff says the agents did not think they were pricing the unit at a dramatically low number. The sale price was much higher than they expected.
"Sometimes you just don't know who is going to come to the table," she says.
As for Ms. Laird, she says most of the people who have viewed her waterfront condo appear to be investors looking to take advantage of desperate sellers, but she doesn't feel that pressure.
The couple has not yet purchased a house and they will take the unit off the market rather than cave to lowball bids, she says. She notes the unit is already priced well below what similar units traded for in August.
She figures the flight to the suburbs is temporary and that many people - especially young professionals - will still want to live close to downtown. She and her partner would too if they weren't planning to start a family.
"The plan right now is not to take any sort of predatory offer that would just be taking advantage," Ms. Laird says. "We kind of do believe that things will start to return."

Investors rush to get out of prebuilt Toronto condo deals

Full text: Real estate investors are increasingly trying to get out of closing on their newly built condos in the Toronto region, as rents plummet and banks toughen borrowing qualifications for rental properties.
Selling the right to buy the new condo, also known as assignment sales, has soared during the past few months of the coronavirus pandemic, according to realtors.
It is a sign of weakness in the condo market beset by a glut of new units, declining rents and a dwindling number of renters.
"We are seeing a massive wave of assignments of people who don't want to close in this market," said Simeon Papailias, senior partner with REC Canada, which brokers hundreds of preconstruction sales every year.
Since the pandemic started early this year, the rental vacancy rate in the Greater Toronto Area has reached its highest level in more than a decade and the average rental price is 9 per cent lower than the previous year, according to industry research group Urbanation Inc.
Demand for rentals has declined, with border restrictions slowing immigration, tourism and the influx of foreign students.
At the same time, the number of available rental units has spiked. A record 23,000 new condos units will be completed in the Toronto region this year, and another 22,434 are due next year, according to Urbanation. It estimates that 50 per cent were bought as rental units.
Condo resales and their average selling price have increased over the previous year. As well, preconstruction sales on condo projects are still robust.
But the number of new condo listings and new rental-unit listings are rapidly increasing. If that persists, realtors predict selling prices will start to decline.
As well, many Airbnb operators turned their properties into long-term rentals or are trying to sell them because tourism disappeared. In addition, many condo tenants gave up their places when they lost work or because they found space outside of the city.
Now, real estate investors who are set to close on their new condos worry that they won't be able to cover their mortgage payments with rent.
"Guys who are closing in the short term are absolutely shook and affected by the pandemic and what it has done to the rental market. That is what is pushing them to assign," said Mr. Papailias, who estimates that assignments now account for between 20 per cent and 25 per cent of his preconstruction sales. This compared with a range of 10 per cent to 15 per cent before the pandemic.
Unlike condo resales, which is tracked by local boards, there is no database for condo assignments and realtors are typically not allowed to list them. Over all, assignments account for a small fraction of the residential property market.
Assignment sales are only allowed when the condo building is almost completed, and the sale must be approved by the condo developer. The original buyer would have made a down payment for the purchase and sales agreement on the preconstruction condo before it was built about three or four years ago. For condos set to close this year, the original purchase was made around 2016 or 2017, when the economy was strong and demand for downtown city living was high.
With COVID-19 cases rising and some pandemic restrictions back in place, people are losing income and the economic recovery is uncertain. Banks don't want investors defaulting on their mortgage payments and are trying to ensure that investors have cash and employment income to draw upon if a tenant stops paying rent.
Since the pandemic began, lenders have become stricter with their qualifications, including in some cases requiring bigger down payments and not accepting down payments that were borrowed.
"The financing has gotten a lot more difficult," said Matt Elkind, senior broker with Connect Realty, an expert in preconstruction sales. "The banks' appetite to lend to investors is down significantly. An individual, six months ago, would have qualified without problem. They're not now," he said.
Mr. Elkind said one of his clients did not qualify for a bank mortgage because she received federal aid when her business lost revenue from the pandemic. Some banks are asking prospective borrowers for a 35-per-cent down payment to qualify for the mortgage, whereas in the past, 20 per cent would suffice.
Lenders are also recognizing less of the rental income as part of the borrower's total income. For example, before the pandemic, a lender would count 80 per cent of the prospective rental income as part of the borrower's total income. Now, the same lender will only recognize 50 per cent of that income, according to real estate experts.
"For people whose only income is rental, it is hard to qualify," said Bernadette Laxamana, mortgage broker and president of Karista Mortgage in B.C.
Banks typically have the cheapest mortgages, with interest rates at record lows.
(The popular five-year fixed rate is below 2 per cent.) If buyers don't qualify at a bank, they are forced to seek alternative lenders, which typically charge higher interest rates.
"They are having to look at options where the money is much more expensive.
That is where people are having problems," Mr. Elkind said.
Because the prices of condos have increased since 2016, investors are able to sell their contracts at a higher price, according to realtors, though they said it was not an ideal time to sell, especially as housing demand is expected to soar with Ottawa boosting immigration targets for the next three years.
"Life changes, your situation changes and you have the option to sell. Is this the best time to sell it? No it is not," said Hunny Gawri, managing partner of My Investment Brokers, which works on all types of preconstruction projects.

Full text: Live venues are closed. Concert dates postponed. Television and movie productions scaled back.
What's a celebrity to do?
Stuck at home like everyone else, a vast and growing number are turning to the Cameo app, where users can scroll through screen after screen of familiar (and unfamiliar) faces, find someone they like and request a personalized video message at a fee specified by the talent.
To name a few of the many Canadians on Cameo: Shark Tank's Kevin O'Leary will do a shout-out for a product or service you're trying to promote. K. Trevor Wilson of Letterkenny will wish you a "supersoft" birthday. Anne with an E's Cara Ricketts will offer warm words of encouragement to those laid low by lockdowns. And Colin Mochrie might sing you a semi-improvised hoedown.
"Leading up to March, I believe, I was doing two different tours ... and I was filming a movie," says Mochrie, 62, the Torontobased improv comic of Whose Line is it Anyway? fame.
"And then the next day, I was in the most vulnerable [age] group of a pandemic. So almost immediately, everything changed, and I came home."
Now Cameo is "basically my only source of income."
To date, Mochrie has filmed about 2,800 witty, personalized videos, for which he currently charges $100 (all figures USD).
What do you get for that money? "An incredible video by an international comedy icon," he mock-boasts. "And possibly a hoedown."
"I try to keep the video at least a minute and a half. So that'd be like, you know, almost a buck a second."
Ninety seconds is generous for a Cameo video. As a result, he's earned a perfect fivestar rating out of 830-plus reviews.
Mochrie's fee puts him somewhere in the middle range of Cameo talent, on par with Drake's dad, Dennis Graham ($100).
That's well below Tiger King's Carole Baskin ($299), former Mexican president Vicente Fox ($300), Snoop Dogg ($900) and - with Cameo's top fee - Caitlyn Jenner ($2,500), but above former MMA fighter Randy Couture ($50) and the guy who played Pinhead in one of the Hellraiser movies ($45).
The Chicago-based company, which launched in 2017, used to have an overabundance of second-tier athletes, Donald Trump impersonators and "where are they now?" reality TV stars. They're all still there, but so are a lot more celebrity actors and musicians - ranging from Rosie O'Donnell to John Cleese, Ice Cube to Alice Cooper - as well as YouTube and TikTok stars.
The talent pool has soared during the COVID-19 pandemic, now numbering in the tens of thousands.
"Immediately after stay-at-home orders came down, we saw our biggest influx of talent in our company's history," Cameo spokesperson Brandon Kazimer wrote in an e-mail. "We're seeing thousands of bookings every day."
The sheer size of the marketplace can make it hard to compete with the bigger names, so a lot of the Canadian talent comes at a relative bargain. There are a number of Degrassi stars, some Kids in the Hall, Letterkennys and Trailer Park Boys, all generally in the $100 and under range (except Bubbles, who bills $300). Jann Arden asks $65 and donates it all to animal charities. Canadian Broadway actor Chilina Kennedy charges $30.
Meanwhile, comic Russell Peters will cost you $500. And O'Leary demands an astounding $1,200.
"I can only do so many Cameos a day. So the way I limit demand is price, like in any product or service," says O'Leary, who has been with Cameo since its early days in 2017.
Juno-winning country singer Jess Moskaluke just signed onto the platform this past May as a way to manage all the fan requests she'd been getting over social media "for a shout-out."
"My husband was getting these requests.
My mom was getting requests. I was getting them through Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, even old e-mails, everything, and it was becoming impossible to manage," she says from her Rocanville, Sask., home.
"Cameo has made it really easy. ... I just send them that one link and it's like ‘here you go.' " Moskaluke has done about 30 videos so far, at $28 a pop, which is no replacement for the income she lost by having to cancel a 60-odd-night road trip earlier this year after only three shows.
"This year looks dramatically different for me than what it was supposed to," she says.
Same goes for Ricketts, who left her New York apartment after Broadway shut down, and moved back home to Brampton, Ont.
More than ever she felt the need to connect with her friends and followers.
"I thought that the best way to combat how small my world was getting was to reach out through social media," Ricketts says.
On Instagram she gets hundreds of direct messages, so she's unlikely to see if a new fan is trying to reach out.
Cameo appealed as a way to find her most devoted followers.
"Cameo is like a clearer line," she says. "Adding a price to it ... cuts out a lot of the people who just want to do it for the thrill."
Her aim right now isn't to make money, so she charges just $10, a price she says is low enough to still be affordable for her followers in countries with an unfavourable exchange rate to the U.S. dollar. But not quite high enough to deter would-be suitors, it turns out.
"Someone's trying to ask me out right now," Ricketts says. It's not the first time.
Cameo's success this year has meant an onslaught of similar platforms (including Greetzly, CelebVM and Starsona) trying to woo much of the same talent.
"There's been at least five other similar types of apps who have contacted me," says Mochrie, but he's staying monogamous. "I don't know if it's a Canadian thing, but I feel like it'd be cheating on Cameo."
O'Leary says he spoke with another one last week but didn't like their business model.
"The reason Cameo is the market share leader," he explains, "is that they have aggregated the celebrities of multiple genres, whether it's music, whether it's sports, whether it's television, whether it's drama or scripted reality TV. They have spent the last multiple years doing that. And it's going to be very hard to catch up with them."
Shark Tank's Mr. Wonderful is chatting from the 4K studio at his Muskoka cottage, where he's in quarantine but had a full schedule of live hits to the daytime talk shows to promote the show's Season 12 premiere.
Between takes, he expected to shoot six Cameos. On a typical day he'll shoot as many as 12.
Since signing on with the app, O'Leary estimates he's made "probably thousands" of videos.
"As the price has increased, it's just more and more businesses approaching me. Very few people say, ‘Do a shout-out to my sixyear-old' for 1,200 dollars," he says. "You know, mostly I'm supporting entrepreneurs, and I'm happy to do that."
Essentially, he's a spokesperson for hire - which makes him far from unique among Cameo talent, although he's one of the most successful.
But although he's done videos for everything from local real estate firms to vodka brands to sporting goods franchises, his endorsement isn't guaranteed.
O'Leary says he "curates" the requests he gets, rejecting the ones he's not comfortable with (or wherever there's a conflict with his own business interests).
"I know exactly what I'm doing. They give me a suggested script, I embellish it very often, I know exactly what I'm talking about and why. And very often I'll go on their website to get a better understanding of what their business is, so I can help them out," O'Leary says.
"Why wouldn't I want to help those people?" The majority of Cameo shoppers, on a tighter budget, are looking for one thing: a unique and memorable gift for a special occasion. Watch the video previews on any performer's Cameo page, and you start to notice a certain sameness. After doing hundreds or thousands of these personalized videos, doesn't it start to get tedious?
"As an actor you get used to repetition so it's not unlike doing multiple takes," explains Letterkenny's K. Trevor Wilson, who joined Cameo in June and makes 15 to 20 videos a week, at $100 apiece.
"What's nice is I get to decide the schedule so if I get bored I stop."
Wilson has no plans to stop altogether, even when the pandemic ends and performers can go back to their everyday gigs.
"This is a great side hustle," he says.

GERMAN MILLS Asking price: $1,299,000 (July, 2020) Previous asking price: $1.399-million (February, 2020); $1.588-million (November, 2019) - under previous agents Selling price: $1,298,500 (July, 2020) Previous selling price: $1,050,000 (July, 2019) Taxes: $6,753 (2020) Days on the market: One Listing agents: Andre Kutyan and Robert Greenberg, Harvey Kalles Real Estate Ltd.
THE ACTION On a cul-de-sac near the Bayview Golf and Country Club, this semi-detached house on a 20-foot-by-119-foot lot was twice listed unsuccessfully.
With a new agent and a new, lower asking price, it scored a buyer in its first day on the market in late July after just six showings.
"This is a big price for a semidetached house," agent Andre Kutyan said, but its superior finishes and features warranted the price.
Mr. Kutyan said his preliminary research made it clear that there was a narrow window of opportunity in the local market.
"Looking between $900,000 and $1.4-million before we went on the market, there were 23 listings and 15 of them were detached.
Buyers had a lot of choice of detached homes in the general area, so it was important to be on the money with pricing."
WHAT THEY GOT The kitchen and three bathrooms in this more than 40-year-old house were recently renovated. There is oak flooring in the open living and dining areas lit by new pot lighting and a sunken family room with a fireplace and access to a wide south-facing deck.
The second floor has a laundry room and three bedrooms, including one with a skylight, fireplace, walk-in closet and spiral staircase to a loft. The house includes a built-in garage.
THE AGENT'S TAKE "It's in a good area south of the Bayview golf course," Mr. Kutyan said.

Full text: A poor east-end Montreal neighbourhood that became a high-profile victim of postwar "urban renewal" mania is set for yet another sweeping makeover.
Familiarly known as the Faubourg à m'lasse - or Molasses District - the area east of downtown has experienced major disruptions in its lifetime, including the cruel eviction in 1963-64 of about 5,000 working-class residents and the razing of almost 800 homes to make way for Radio-Canada's new broadcast centre.
Radio-Canada sold the complex and surrounding area to developer Groupe Mach Inc. three years ago and the latter has put together an ambitious mixed-use project - the Quartier des lumières - aimed at renewing the area.
Plans outlined by Mach and its partners - including Devimco Immobilier and architectural firm Lemay - call for a sprawling development around Maison de RadioCanada, the 24-storey hexagonal tower that failed in its mission to become the focal point of a burgeoning second downtown in the predominantly francophone, economically impoverished east end of Montreal.
The Maison is surrounded by desolate parking lots, squeezed in between traffic-heavy René-Lévesque Boulevard and the VilleMarie Expressway.
Any redevelopment faces the challenge of not only reviving this bleak expanse, but also reconnecting it with its surrounding urban landscape.
City of Montreal officials say they are not prepared at this stage to discuss the residential/office/ commercial project or provide details about it because of continuing negotiations with the promoters.
For their part, the promoters say they are keen to avoid simply dropping an alien megaproject into the area. They tout their desire to create a "complete neighbourhood" receptive to the needs of the local population, with a focus on social housing, schools, active mobility, parks and public spaces.
"It's a big challenge, with large neighbourhood developments, to integrate all of the different concerns," Christopher Sweetnam Holmes, Mach's vice-president of development, says in a promotional video. "And what we tried to do was really listen. We spent a lot of time meeting groups, meeting individuals.
"People wanted to feel that the neighbourhood was permeable.
That there wasn't a wall of big new buildings. They wanted to feel like they could easily cross through. We created a lot of secondary paths to allow people to cross through the neighbourhood."
Éric Michaud, of community group Comité logement Ville-Marie, is one of several local activists who were consulted over the years on plans not only for the Quartier but also for other nearby projects that will have a transformative impact on the district, including a condo redevelopment of the historic Molson Brewery site.
So far, there are positive signs that the Quartier des lumières addresses some of the community's concerns over access to social and affordable housing, Mr. Michaud said. It is critical that new condo developments not only have a strong affordability component but also make room for larger units suited to families, he said.
"There are elements in the plan that are in keeping with what we're asking for," he said.
At a public meeting of the Office de consultation publique de Montréal in late September, one resident said he's worried some of the Quartier's towers will be too tall and overwhelming for an area comprised mainly of low-rise, red-brick housing.
Bruno Collin, an urbanist with the Ville-Marie borough of Montreal, replied that he's satisfied the new towers won't be invasive or fortress-like, with lots of diversity in the façade treatment, thin vertical profiles and close attention to the importance of not dampening street-level activity.
But there is inevitably a tradeoff between the need for generous public spaces and parks and achieving an acceptable level of density, which means higher towers, Mr. Collin said.
By way of bolstering their social and environmental bona fides, the Quartier's developers point to the certification awarded by Fitwel, operated by the Center for Active Design, a leading international player in the healthybuilding movement. The program stresses the positive health impacts resulting from emphasizing pedestrian and bicycle connections, access to quality public spaces and controlled densities.
Gérard Beaudet, an urban planner and professor at the School of Urban Planning and Landscape Architecture at the University of Montreal, says the damage done to the Faubourg will never be completely repaired. But there seems to be a genuine desire on the part of the Quartier's developers to create something positive and responsive to the local community, he said.
"The area can be made more liveable, more convivial."
One aspect to closely monitor as the project evolves is the possibility that the clustering of tall towers will result in blocked sunlight and unwelcome gusts of wind, Mr. Beaudet added.
Ron Rayside, a Montreal architect advocating architecture with a social and humanist bent, has been a consultant to various community groups working to ensure that their concerns regarding the Quartier are addressed.
"The way the project is going so far, both the city and the developers have been taking into account suggestions from community organizations," he said. But: "The whole impact on the rest of the neighbourhood, some parts of it are still not clear."
For example, the possibility that some of the towers will be too tall. Or the danger that the influx of more expensive condos will put undue upward pressure on the real estate values of the existing housing stock and ultimately exclude many lower-income residents.
Mr. Rayside also cautions against the danger that the new retail component of the Quartier des lumières will draw business away from vulnerable local businesses on the commercial strip of nearby Sainte-Catherine Street East.
Massive new projects of the size of the Quartier sometimes end up also putting pressure on the price of retail space, resulting in big-box and chain outfits pushing out of small local businesses that can't afford the higher rents, he said.

New real estate players try to gain foothold in Canada's hot market

Full text: New real estate players are trying to grab a piece of Canada's booming real estate market, taking on traditional brokerages in the latest battle for a share of the lucrative business.
Properly Inc. and lower-commission brokerages Redfin and Justo are some of the latest to expand in Toronto and beyond. But gaining a foothold has proved tough in the past. Companies such as Purplebricks, Zillow and Zoocasa tried to shake up the status quo in Canada over the years only to retreat, stagnate or change their business model.
But the latest crop of players think they have a better shot this time. A new model has emerged with Properly, which offers home sellers a guaranteed sale and price. "People are craving a different way of doing things," said Properly co-founder and chief executive Anshul Ruparell.
Like most of the industry, Properly charges the typical 5-per-cent commission on the selling price of the property. But unlike other real estate brokerages, it acts as a backstop for home sellers by providing them with a firm purchase agreement to buy their property at a set price. The purchase agreement has a 90-day closing period, which gives Properly 90 days to sell the home on the open market before they need to buy it themselves.
For homeowners, this agreement allows them to list their homes without worrying about whether their home will sell or how much it will fetch. In a frothy market like Toronto, it allows them to get a firm mortgage approval from a lender. In a depressed market like Calgary, it gives them peace of mind.
Properly's capital is available regardless of market conditions, said Mr. Ruparell, who started his company in 2018 in Calgary, where he grew up. He expanded to Ottawa in January and in Toronto this summer. He plans to move further into Ontario.
Properly recently secured a $100-million line of credit, which will provide it with funding if it needs to buy homes that don't sell on the open market. So far, Properly has not had to buy any. Its business model has been low risk in Ottawa and Toronto, where competition is fierce and houses sell within days of being listed.
If the market softens, as is starting to happen with downtown Toronto condos, that sale guarantee could become more attractive to customers. In a sustained downturn in which prices drop precipitously and demand dries up, Properly could be left holding multiple homes on its books. Mr. Ruparell said he set up the company so that it could hold homes up to a total value of $100-million.
Since its Toronto launch in the summer, Properly has been hired to list 18 homes. Of those, the company struck firm purchase agreements with 15 of the home sellers. The company excludes some types of homes from its list of guaranteed purchases, such as studio condos in Toronto. As well, Properly offers a sales commission discount to customers who list their properties without entering into a purchase agreement with Properly.
Redfin and Justo have been trying to win over customers with lower commissions and refunds.
Seattle-based Redfin expanded into Toronto and Vancouver last year. However, the company's annual net losses have been growing as a percentage of its overall revenue for the past few years and Redfin has repeatedly said its business model depends on its ability to attract customers to its website.
In Canada, the 5-per-cent commission is normally split evenly between the realtor who lists the property and the buyer's realtor. For example, the commission on a property that sells for $1-million is $50,000 plus tax. The seller's realtor, or listing agent, earns 2.5 per cent or $25,000 and the buyer's realtor earns the other 2.5 per cent or $25,000. (The customer pays the tax.)
By contrast, Redfin realtors charge a 3.5-percent commission on the home sale. It retains 1 per cent of that amount, while the buyer's agent gets their usual 2.5 per cent. If the buyer is using a Redfin agent, they will receive cash back on Redfin's commission. Redfin would not provide details on how that amount is calculated.
Justo, which started in 2018 in Toronto, expanded to London, Ont., in July and recently received a cash infusion from investors to bolster its marketing. It charges 3.75 per cent, of which it keeps 1.25 per cent and 2.5 per cent is collected by the buyer's realtor. Similar to Redfin's model, if a buyer uses a Justo realtor, the buyer gets part of that realtor's commission if the price of the home is above $300,000.
The biggest problem for new entrants is that competition is fierce for a transaction that typically only takes place once or twice in a consumer's lifetime. There are more than 130,000 licensed realtors in Canada. In Ontario, the largest real estate market in the country, there are 86,734 licensed realtors, according to its governing body.
"There are always new entrants trying to make a splash. But it's difficult when you have two very large national brands that have such a large base," said Re/Max regional director Christopher Alexander.
Re/Max has 21,295 full time licensed realtors working under its brand name. Mr. Alexander estimates Re/Max's market share is about 33 per cent across the country. Royal LePage has 18,000 licensed realtors and a national market share of about 20 per cent, according to the brand's CEO, Phil Soper.
"It's harder when you have large dominant players to eke out market share," said Mr. Soper, who said he takes every player seriously. Mr. Soper says that lowering commissions is no guarantee of winning business because home buyers and sellers want the comfort of a big name, a common argument made by established realtors. "Because the transaction is so huge, they tend to gravitate to successful realtors."
Purplebricks tried to shake up the industry with a flat-fee model but wound up backing out of most markets in Canada and is now only operating in Quebec.
Zoocasa, which under its first owner, Rogers Communications Inc., tried to offer a low-fee service and sell ads and leads to realtors, now operates under new leadership as a full service brokerage with commissions.
With licensed brokerages able to access the database of property listings controlled by the local boards through their Multiple Listing Service (MLS) system, the new players believe customers are getting more comfortable with a new way of doing business.
They are benefiting from the work companies such as Zillow and HouseSigma have done attracting people to their websites.
Redfin's Vancouver broker, Brooks Findlay, says that the biggest barrier is becoming known in Canada, although he insists it is happening.
Traditional brokerages are "working hard to become more digital," he said.
Justo's co-founder said prospective customers thought low commissions meant less service, but she said that is not the case. "In the beginning, there was no Purplebricks, no Redfin and it really felt like people did not understand. They thought, ‘Oh, you are a discount brokerage.' Justo is not a discount brokerage.
We are giving full service," said Daphne De Groot.
New entrants in the mortgage business face similar obstacles. Toronto-based Pinch Financial, which launched in 2017, allows prospective home buyers to qualify for a mortgage with multiple lenders in less than 10 minutes.
It has the advantage of not competing with thousands of realtors and providing a niche service, although it does compete with banks' mortgage brokers and Filogix, which allows mortgage brokers and lenders to communicate.
Pinch is now providing its technology to eight real estate brokerages, including Sotheby's International Realty, as well as a number of financial-services companies, and expects to be profitable next year.
"There are a lot of entrenched existing players," Pinch founder Andrew Wells said. "You are only going to do your mortgage application once in your life. How do you make people comfortable with it? How do you get in front of the customer? We have to get someone before they walk to the RBC branch, before they ask their parents, ‘Do you know a mortgage broker?' " he said.

Full text: The organizers: Sean and Ellie Zahedi The pitch: Donating $1-million to St. Joseph's Health Centre in Toronto S ean Zahedi learned the importance of philanthropy while growing up in Iran.
Mr. Zahedi's grandfather and father were active in a variety of charitable causes and they always encouraged others to get involved. The family helped build schools and worked with health care providers to ensure that local hospitals had the right equipment.
"I used to go with my grandfather to all these charities," Mr. Zahedi, 39, recalled from his home in Toronto. "He was always one of the pioneers in fundraising and encouraging others to help out."
When Mr. Zahedi came to Canada in 2007 to study finance at Ryerson University, he vowed to follow the family tradition. He stayed in Toronto and eventually found his way into real estate as a broker with Baker Real Estate, which specializes in marketing preconstruction condominiums and townhouses. Now married with two small boys, Mr. Zahedi and his wife, Ellie, became involved with St. Joseph's Health Centre, where both of their children were born. Mr. Zahedi served as an ambassador for the hospital, raising community awareness of its services and connecting with potential donors.
Recently the couple went further and made a $1-million donation to the hospital.
They both see St. Joseph's as a critical part of the Bloor West community, especially during the pandemic, and they hope to play a role in its future growth. "St.
Joe's hospital is serving 500,000 people in the west end," he said.
"It's a very old hospital and needs a lot of work."
And just as his father and grandfather did in Iran, Mr. Zahedi is hoping to build a legacy of philanthropy in Canada. "I also want to teach my children independence and self-reliance as a path to success," he said. "And once you're there, the importance of giving back. My biggest hope is that one day my kids will experience what I feel - a feeling of profound satisfaction and joy of emotional returns when giving back. And that in itself will be the strongest motivator to do good."

Full text: In drag racing, every ounce counts. The best racers down at Cayuga's dragway and car-racing course use cables for door handles, look through Lexan instead of glass, exchange conventional batteries for lithium ones a quarter the size, replace metal body panels with carbon fibre, remove glove boxes, padding and all other creature comforts and swap out every part possible for the aluminum version.
The result is a lithe, muscular, built-for-speed machine that wows crowds and breaks records.
Just up the road, architect Bill Curran, Haldimand County chief administration officer Craig Manley and general manager Philip Mete are tightening up the last aluminum bolts, metaphorically speaking, at the new Haldimand County central administration building. Open since February of this year, it's a lean, muscular, built-for-efficiency 43,000square-foot piece of architecture that's also wowing crowds.
"I started here 18 years ago," Mr. Mete says, "and it didn't take me two weeks to realize we needed a centralized building." Indeed, when the single-tier municipality south of Hamilton was created in January, 2001, by combining Dunnville, Hagersville, Cayuga, Caledonia, Jarvis and everything in between (now sporting a population of 45,000), getting a permit for anything was a pain in the neck for the average person.
"Back then," he continues, "I would have people come in and see me in Caledonia; if it was a Dunnville project they'd have to go to Dunnville to see the building inspector, they'd have to go see a planner in Hagersville and then they would have to go get water, waste-water and road permits out of Kohler, which is on the way to the lake ... at least four offices, sometimes even five."
Finally, in the second decade of the 21st century, Mr. Manley says, things started to happen: "We took a long-term look at the lifecycle [and did] a financial analysis of the existing buildings ... they were all filled to capacity. We [asked] how much work is required to keep these things going, we looked at them in terms of their possibility of expansion because we're a growing community."
When those numbers suggested a new build, Hamilton's Thier + Curran Architects were called upon to look at a somewhat narrow site adjacent to Cayuga Memorial Arena. "I remember meeting Bill for the first time, and he [said]: ‘Wow, this is a tough site, this'll be a fun project' ... and it's been a blast."
"It's been a great collaboration," Mr. Curran confirms.
We're standing at the southwest corner of the site at Chippewa Street E. and Thorburn Street, admiring the dramatic, angled slope of the new council chamber roof; one of the few flourishes this drag-ready building possesses.
Below the big window, glinting in the sun, "real Wiarton escarpment limestone" adds some physical weight to underline the mental heavy lifting that goes on inside.
Beyond the council chamber, the lobby's two-storey glass wall recedes a little, the canopy over the entrance (which locals have christened "the hockey stick") juts out, followed by the glassy stair tower and, finally, the office wing pushes out as well; to enhance this rhythm, cladding alternates between light and dark wood-look panels and two colours of brick. "We wanted to make sure it was a warm building that didn't feel like your typical bland, government office building," Mr. Curran offers.
We step inside the light-filled, high-ceilinged lobby - the story here is that a three-storey atrium was perceived as too ostentatious - and our eyes are greeted by the usual counters and waiting-room furniture, but also by colourful murals by Jamie Lawson, interesting light fixtures (as chosen by Mr. Curran) and a ton of pattern provided by the heavy grain of birch.
"Birch is just a wood that's out of favour," Mr. Curran says. "It's super inexpensive but we just think it's beautiful; it's what was used in every school in the fifties and sixties ... and then we used a little bit of zebra wood for an accent."
Just past the customer-service desk, the mayor and Mr. Manley have their offices ... and they're not very large, which was exactly the point. "We made a deliberate decision, early on, that we were going to try to democratize space ... those kinds of little decisions have gone a long way," Mr. Manley says.
Further efficiencies have been achieved by grouping general managers with their staff but allowing for cross-pollination between departments vis-à-vis a big lounge area, big kitchen and even a semi-sheltered outdoor area with a barbecue: "There was a lot of discussion [about this] because you don't want the public driving by saying, ‘What are these guys doing, they're supposed to be working,' " Mr. Manley says with a laugh. "That led to some of the design features."
Single-family homes that border the site also dictated how the building - and particularly the windows - had to be shaped and positioned. Walking the second and third floors, it's clear that no matter where one stands, it's impossible to peer into anyone's backyard.
It's also clear that little things, such as hydraulic desks (which don't cost much more than regular ones), nice tile in the bathrooms, windows that actually open, multiple basement shower stalls for outdoor workers and cheerful paint colours and murals on the walls (or even the carpet underfoot), were understood to be, collectively, very big things for the mental health of the building's occupants.
Mr. Mete tells of one former councillor - a pig farmer by day - who got quite emotional when he toured the building earlier this year. "He was very choked up when he went through, it was a big deal for him."
"This is the best exemplar of what a good office building looks like in 2020, or 2050 probably," Mr. Curran says.
And, at $21-million, as lean and mean as the best drag car down at the track.

Developers set sights on Toronto-area golf courses

Full text: For decades, one version of the suburban dream was to have a house overlooking a golf course or country club. But an insatiable hunger for land in the Greater Toronto Area has seen more of those fairways converted to roadways in new subdivisions.
In some cases, what may have once been a rural course has been enveloped by suburban expansion. And while the golf industry has seen a minor upswing as a past-time appropriate to COVID-19 physical distancing, devoting 100-plus acres to chasing a ball down a hole simply can't compete with the insatiable appetite for development land.
York Downs Golf and Country Club in Markham had been a private club until the membership voted in 2014 to sell the land for a reported $412-million.
"The golf course went through a transition, a rethinking of the viability of their course," said Frank Spaziani, vice-president of Kylemore Developments, which purchased the land. The wheels of planning grind slowly though, and only now are approvals in place to begin selling new homes on the site. About 30 per cent of the more than 100 acres will be kept as a public park, something the community was keen to see during the planning process.
"The simple fact is it was a private course, and now we're opening it up," said Cailey Stollery, chief executive of Kylemore & Angus Glen Group of Companies.
"All these trails and valleys going through Unionville, we opened up some green space for the local community."
Kylemore is the development arm of the Stollery family, who built the Angus Glen golf club in Markham and over the past 15 years has built suburban housing surrounding it.
Some time in November (or December, depending on weather) the final rounds will be played at York Downs as sales open on future homes. Construction will begin in the spring of 2021. The initial phase will offer townhomes and detached homes ranging from 2,000 square feet to more than 6,000 square feet. Ultimately, more than 1,100 homes are expected to be built over the next decade of development.
The pressure to redevelop golf course lands is being felt further north of Toronto as well.
Geranium Corp. is doing infill development of golf courses in Aurora and Port Perry.
The Port Perry plan is essentially an extension to the neighbouring seniors community, complete with automatic enrolment in the resident's association (with all its attendant rules, such as no fences).
In Aurora, the company faced pushback as its course snaked around and through a built-up neighbourhood that was itself partly converted from golf lands in the 1980s.
"The course used to be about twice as large," said Cheryl Shindruk, executive vice-president of land development at Geranium, and current chair of the Building Industry and Land Development Association (BILD). "There's always a fear of change. It's pretty common, to have a negative reaction from the community.
When we looked at the Aurora site, population in this neighbourhood was declining, even though it was labelled a stable community. As the population ages in suburban areas, the kids have been raised and moved on."
A settlement at the former Ontario Municipal Board kept the project on course. The deal that was worked out saw a large portion of the once-private course (about 52 acres) becoming public parkland. And the community was mollified that there wouldn't be hundreds of townhouses in their backyards; most of the course will be converted to largelot single-detached homes.
Ms. Shindruk is keenly aware that the provincial government's Growth Plan seeks to promote infill and more density, moving away from the postwar car suburb design that gobbles up land while housing relatively little of Ontario's booming population.
But she said we shouldn't be surprised if large-scale redevelopments of golf courses look more like that past than a densely packed future.
"In the last decade or so there's been a change in the way the housing market is supplied, from being predominantly lowrise housing to today, tipped on the high-rise side," she said. "In the last few months we've seen things settle out a little bit and there's not such a difference between the two. Ground housing is a very desirable house form.
The market has been undersupplied with that housing form."
Indeed, as reported by Altus Group in September, sales of new ground-related housing (detached, semi-detached and townhouses, excluding stacked towns) in the GTA soared in August, up 355 per cent from 2019 with 1,930 units sold.
The Aurora and Port Perry golf course redevelopments will see homes with a median price of about $1-million.
"A lot of those [our purchasers] are move-up buyers - from York Region south, Markham, Richmond Hill - moving for schools or high schools of choice, moving from 36-, 40-foot lots making their jump up," said Stephanie Lane, director of sales and marketing at Geranium.
The Growth Plan does require finding some density somewhere on a site if builders hope to sell large lots of ground-related housing. In all three cases, a multiresidential building is planned for future phases of the projects, usually at the edges of the sites just off the major roads.
"Growth plan policies also speaks to compatibility and character that is consistent with the area. ... We took our cues from the existing community. The density is planned on the Yonge Street corridor, that's where we've proposed a multiresidential seven-storey building," Ms. Shindruk said.
None of the builders think their plans have much to say about the popularity of golf.
They see these redevelopments as just the natural consequence of land prices being pushed higher by planning doctrine and population growth.
As for Angus Glen, the course created by Ms. Stollery's father, for now there are no plans to do away with golf. "We're here to stay," she says. "There's always going to be an Angus Glen golf course ... [although] it likely won't be 36 holes."

Full text: B.C.'s three main political parties and their supporters have competing visions for the province. Here's where they stand, in alphabetical order, on the campaign's pressing issues.
ECONOMIC STIMULUS GREENS The Greens promise to end provincial subsidies to oil and gas companies and redirect roughly a billion dollars in savings toward businesses that will help B.C.
become carbon neutral in the next 25 years. The party would also put $300-million toward a six-month rent subsidy program for small businesses.
The party would consult with industry players and unions to explore allowing employers to adopt a four-day work week while their workers remain full-time employees with benefits.
The Greens would also begin transitioning B.C. to a universal basic income.
The party would restart the work of the Fair Wages Commission to recommend predictable minimum-wage increases and the party would phase in a basic-income plan for people 18-24 who are aging out of foster care. The Greens would overhaul the provincial grant program to help small tourism businesses decimated by COVID-19 and work with Ottawa to create a new loan program for larger hospitality and tourism companies in trouble.
LIBERALS The party promises to stimulate the economy with a $30.9-billion infrastructure plan over the next three years that would build roads, hospitals, health and mentalhealth clinics, nursing homes and affordable housing. The Liberals would also do away with the Community Benefits Agreement so that these projects would be open to bidding from companies whose workers are not unionized.
The Liberals would spend $1.1-billion to create a system of $10-a-day child care for families earning up to $65,000. Daycare spots would also be available for up to $30-a-day for families making up to $125,000 a year. Their plan would also build 10,000 new child care spaces. The party says it would also offer a loan-guarantee program for tourism and hospitality businesses.
NDP The New Democrats pledge to invest $400-million into community infrastructure projects and a further $300-million in recovery grants to support roughly 15,000 small and medium-sized businesses facing hardship through the pandemic.
The NDP is also promising a cash payout of $1,000 to families making less than $125,000 a year and $500 to single people earning less than $62,000. The party would also offer training programs to help more workers transition to jobs that are needed.
Once the minimum wage hits $15 an hour next year the New Democrats pledge to tie further increases to the rate of inflation. The NDP would also help gig workers with precarious employment by creating a system of government-backed benefits for them.
The New Democrats say they would get funding from Ottawa to increase the number of parents taking advantage of their $10-a-day child care pilot program.
TAXES GREENS The Greens say they would form a task force to modernize employment standards and reduce inequality with an eye to working with Ottawa to make multinational companies pay their "fair share" of provincial taxes. The party would also immediately reinstate the scheduled carbon tax increase put on hold by the NDP to keep adding $10 a year to the levy.
LIBERALS The party's landmark tax promise is to eliminate the 7-per-cent provincial sales tax for one year and then bring it back at 3 per cent to stimulate an economic recovery. The Liberals have also promised to permanently drop the 2-per-cent smallbusiness income tax.
The party would end the speculation and vacancy tax, which penalizes people who own homes in several real estate hot spots that are not their principal residence or rented out for half the year as well as foreign owners or satellite families who pay little to no taxes in Canada. The Liberals would replace that levy with a capital gains tax on investors who flip condos. The Liberals would also increase property taxes for non-residents. The party would establish an arm's-length "fair tax commission" so that economic experts can review taxes and identify which ones could spur economic growth if they were reduced or eliminated.
NDP The New Democrats are positing only a few tweaks, such as doubling the "climate action" tax credits to everyone in the province as well as striking a task force to determine a new tax break for film and TV productions shooting in B.C.
BALANCING THE BUDGET GREENS The Greens' platform says "now is not the time for austerity" and doesn't mention balancing the budget. They say some of their three-year $10-billion plan to recover from the pandemic will be offset by new revenue sources and savings brought on by the party's policies.
LIBERALS The party is committing to pass a budget in 2022 that charts a path to balancing the budget after a vaccine has started repairing the disruption created by COVID-19.
NDP The New Democrats are only pledging to balance the budget once the economy rebounds and people are "back on their feet" after the pandemic, noting the current tumult has already created a projected operating deficit of $12.8-billion this year.
CLIMATE AND THE ENVIRONMENT GREENS The Greens would make B.C. carbon neutral in the next 25 years and ban all fracking in the province. They would also help communities adapt to climate change and mitigate the risk of natural disasters with a four-year $100-million fund.
The party says it would work with Ottawa, First Nations, local communities and the salmon-farming industry to create incentives aimed at ending open-net aquaculture and transitioning to landbased fish farming.
LIBERALS The party would support investment in renewable energy and work with the federal government and other provinces to improve carbon capture technology, but has not set a date to become carbon neutral. They would also craft a comprehensive greenhouse gas strategy that reduces these emissions while enabling liquid natural gas and other resource development industries to continue. The Liberals plan to accelerate the provincial review and approval process for LNG export projects by collaborating with First Nations groups.
The party also pledges to cut the permit processing time for prospective mines in half. The Liberals would also increase funding to the silviculture industry to plant more trees across the province. The party says it would work with Ottawa to review the scheduled increases to the carbon tax given the economic recession.
NDP The NDP says it has a plan to make the province carbon neutral over the next 30 years and invest in technologies that capture these emissions. The party says it can balance the LNG export industry - including the coming $40-billion LNG Canada export terminal - with its economic, environmental, social and reconciliation commitments. The NDP would also ban disposable plastic products.
SENIORS GREENS The Greens say they want to increase the number of beds available to ailing seniors, but their platform doesn't have a target for funding this expansion. In contrast to its two rivals, the party says it plans to immediately begin shifting public funding away from private companies running nursing homes for profit. The Greens also want to require that all operators in the sector undergo annual inspections as well as provide financial statements and audited expense reports.
LIBERALS The party is pledging to add a billion more dollars into the sector to refurbish or build new facilities with single suites over the next five years. The party says this money would be available to public, non-profit and private nursing home operators, but could not estimate how many new beds this would create.
The Liberals would also launch an independent review into how and why long-term care homes and assisted living facilities have been hit so hard by COVID-19. The party wants to create a tax credit of up to $7,000 a year to help seniors offset the cost of care they receive in their own home.
NDP The New Democrats would add $1.4-billion over the next decade to build publicly owned long-term care homes and eliminate shared rooms from existing sites owned and operated by local health authorities. Like the Liberals, the party could not say how many new units of this type of housing it plans to create.
The party would also hire 7,000 more health care workers for nursing homes and assisted living facilities.
HOUSING GREENS The Greens say they would invest $1.9billion over three years into a range of affordable, supportive and social housing projects, in part by creating a capital fund to support the acquisition and maintenance of affordable rental units by nonprofits. The party would also create a land bank for new co-op housing projects and help extend the leases of existing co-ops that are about to expire.
The party would help renters by introducing a means-tested grant for those with low and medium wages putting more than 30 per cent of their incomes toward rent - the consensus threshold for a lease being unaffordable. To help condo owners confront spiking strata insurance rates, the party would convene a task force of owners, insurers and their brokers to find ways to bring down costs.
LIBERALS The party is committing to a three-year $1.75-billion capital plan to build more homes people can afford. The Liberals would also create an incentive fund for cities to boost housing supply and work with communities to review and reform the property tax structure to build more affordable units and tamp down speculation.
The party would also overhaul the way residential and commercial rental properties have their value assessed to make leases more affordable. The Liberals plan to bring changes to B.C.'s Building Code to make properties more accessible and energy efficient as well as help condo owners fight exorbitant strata insurance premiums. On that front, the party also says it would bring these insurance premiums down by allowing stratas to insure themselves, eliminating the "best-terms" pricing model and mandating strata buildings only need to be insured to a level in line with their history of claims costs.
NDP The New Democrats say they would use provincial money and partnerships with Ottawa, cities, non-profits and private developers to continue building the 114,000 new units of affordable housing promised in a 10-year plan announced prior to forming the government. Earlier this year, Housing Minister Selina Robinson told The Globe just 4,300 of those homes had been completed, with almost half of those units representing temporary modular housing and supportive housing.
The party has committed to freezing rents until the end of next year to help people struggling during the COVID-19 crisis. It has also asked the BC Financial Services Authority to put forward ways to corral ballooning strata insurance fees. If these rates have not "corrected" by the end of 2021, the NDP would give condo owners a public strata insurance option similar to Saskatchewan's system.
They would also give renters the $400a-year stipend the party promised during the previous campaign, but never implemented, so people who don't own their home get something equal to the homeowner grant.
OVERDOSE CRISIS GREENS The party would increase the safe supply of opioids and other street drugs now poisoned and sold in the underground drug trade. The Greens would do this by working to encourage more doctors and pharmacists to take part in the program that gives users non-toxic substances. The Greens would also fund more ways to give people access to these safer drugs, including setting up more secure vending machines.
The Greens' other major drug policy plank would be to de facto decriminalize these substances in B.C.
LIBERALS The Liberals promise to view illicit drug addiction and its myriad social ills through a medical lens. They do not support decriminalizing the possession of small amounts of illicit substances because they view that as federal responsibility, but say they would focus on giving people a pathway to recovery. The party would increase funding for treatment and recovery programs.
NDP The New Democrats would ramp up prescriptions to increase the safe supply of drugs and replace the toxic forms of these substances found on the street. The party is non-committal on embracing de facto decriminalization in the province, but says it would work with police chiefs to put pressure on Ottawa to amend the federal drug laws.
To stop those hurt on the job from developing addictions, the party would mandate that WorkSafeBC provide immediate treatment to those workers suffering chronic pain after a workplace injury.
The New Democrats also promise to step up oversight of private recovery homes and to build new treatment and detox facilities.
TRANSIT GREENS The Greens say they would not allow the long-term losses from the pandemic to affect the service levels of TransLink, BC Transit and BC Ferries. The party also promises that COVID-19 would not disrupt any transit expansion projects already in the works.
The Greens want to work with municipal and regional governments to redesign the way transit is funded with an eye toward mobility, or road, pricing. They would create a regional body to streamline the transit options across Victoria and the other cities on the southern tip of Vancouver Island. The party also promises to bring BC Ferries back under control of the province as a Crown corporation.
LIBERALS The Liberals have a host of promises on major transit infrastructure, including reviving their pledge from the previous campaign to replace the George Massey Tunnel between Richmond and Delta with a 10-lane bridge with dedicated lanes for buses and multipassenger vehicles.
The Liberals would support TransLink's expansion of its grid into North Vancouver and south of the Fraser River into the communities of the Fraser Valley, but do not commit to funding any concrete projects. The party says it would widen the TransCanada Highway east through the Fraser Valley to ease the commuting nightmare that often develops when the route drops to two lanes each way in Abbotsford.
NDP The NDP's major transit-related pledge is to extend the SkyTrain system from Surrey to Langley. Earlier this month, Leader John Horgan said, if re-elected, his government would make that expansion a priority and commit $1.5-billion to the project and lobby the federal government to chip in the rest of the money needed.
The party would make all public transit trips free for children 12 and under. Like the Liberals, the New Democrats would widen Highway 1 through the Fraser Valley by 2026.
On Vancouver Island, the NDP is promising to improve bus service between cities.

Full text: After 17 years making costumes at Stratford Festival, Monica Berg lost her job last spring when the pandemic shut down theatres. She was stunned, but also fearful for her family's finances. Her $45,000 yearly earnings were half of the family's income and around the same time, her husband's photography business was declared non-essential and shuttered.
"We went about three weeks thinking, ‘What are we going to do?' " she recalls. The family reduced their expenses as much as possible and waited. Fortunately, the real estate industry reopened quickly and her husband was able to resume photographing homes for sale.
Ms. Berg, 47, qualified for the federal wage subsidy, which paid her $2,700 a month - 75 per cent of her prepandemic wage - until early August; then she got $2,000 a month from CERB until the program ended in September.
Now her contribution to family finances comes from employment insurance, which amounts to half of her original pay.
The family has a tenant in its home that covers half of the mortgage, and the cost of living in Stratford is fairly reasonable, she says. But she's worried about her future and not sure she can parlay her sewing skills to a job that will pay enough without retraining.
In March and April, three million Canadian workers lost their jobs, and 2.5 million more saw reduced hours, according to Statistics Canada. By the end of September, the market had recouped about 76 per cent of those jobs, leaving about 720,000 to go. The gains blew past forecasts, but economists warn another slowdown could come as lockdowns intensify.
Toronto-based financial planner Shannon Lee Simmons says some of her clients are trying to decide whether going back to school while unemployed makes financial sense. In her mind, using one industry's downtime to retrain for another can help workers diversify their income streams, leading to more security down the road.
Even at a time when money is tight, it can be worth borrowing to train for something with better earnings potential, she says.
"Putting money in retraining is paying yourself first," she says, adding that she's seeing this most among people who used to work around crowds, such as at weddings, sports events and in the arts.
"Our biggest asset is our future cash flow. It has nothing to do with what we currently have in the bank. ... If you don't know if your industry will look the same in the next three to five years, diversifying your income is a great way to provide some financial security and some emotional well-being."
While being unemployed is often stressful, Ms. Simmons says some anguish can be alleviated by focusing on things one can control, such as applying for government assistance and creating a budget. But while many advisers will tell clients to cut back, she suggests "taking a soft, kind look at your expenses," while remembering changes made now don't have to be permanent.
"A lot of people are already living hand to mouth. ... Sometimes there's nothing that can go.
In an emergency, cutting creature comforts seems like it would affect mental health."
She says her clients who are retraining are looking at programs or certificates that take a year or less and cost between $2,000 and $6,000.
Ms. Berg is now taking a sixweek Conestoga College course called College Bound, which helps participants identify a suitable career path, discover financial-aid options and pinpoint skills that could be applied to a new industry. She's thinking about bookkeeping or carpentry, where she could apply many of her skills: "Measuring, cutting, building."
She says just thinking about school is an exercise in hope: "Hope that even if I have to get back into the work force [in the short term, at lower pay], that I can be working towards a new career at the same time."
Candy Ho, assistant professor in integrative career and capstone learning at the University of the Fraser Valley, advises potential career-changers to chart a path with both short- and longterm gains. That way, if the original industry bounces back sooner than expected, students could return to work knowing they have fall-back credentials, without having to commit to a fouryear program all at once.
"There is a big trend toward micro-credentials," she said, referring to short courses that provide a new skill or form building blocks to a certificate or degree.
"Pursuing these micro-credentials - class by class, module by module - gives people the flexibility to work on something while tracking ... what's going on in the [pandemic]."
In addition to EI or the Canada Recovery Benefit, which launched on Oct. 12, Ms. Ho recommends people seek employment help from unions or professional associations of which they are members. There is often career mentorship available from postsecondary alumni associations, she says, adding that graduates should also check in with their school's career centre, as some also serve alumni.
For those who are looking to retrain, it's worth contacting the desired school's financial-aid office. "There is often untapped money people don't know they could be applying [for]," she said.
Every province and territory offers job-retraining programs and funding, which can be accessed through provincial employment agencies and affiliated local career centres. For example, in early October, Ontario announced $75-million to help apprentices cover living expenses.
Finally, there is the Canada Training Benefit, announced in the 2019 federal budget - but it's a tax credit, not cash upfront.
The credit accumulates at $250 a year, up to a lifetime limit of $5,000, and can be used to refund up to half of a course's cost.
But because it just started last year, eligible workers will have banked only $250 to support schooling undertaken this year.
"Time is not on your side if you are out of work and need it right away," Ms. Ho said.

Political parties grapple with issue of seniors care

Full text: The only time in the past seven months Pam Neuman has touched her mother Maureen was inside Vancouver General Hospital in late June - after the 83year-old had arrived for emergency hip surgery following a fall at a local care home.
When the daughter first lay a comforting hand on her mom, a paramedic jumped in to tell her she needed to put on a pair of gloves if she wanted to caress her mom. Shortly after surgery, her mother was moved back to her care home, where her husband of 60 years, Ken, is the lone family member allowed in for short "essential" visits. Maureen, who suffers from vascular dementia, was a staple in all their lives, but Pam Neuman says her three children's memories of their grandmother are fading as the family waits until it can be reunited.
"We won't know until this [pandemic] is all said and done what the long-term effects are on people not having access to their loved ones," she said.
B.C. Seniors Advocate Isobel Mackenzie said preliminary results of a recent survey of more than 12,000 seniors and their loved ones found more than half of the respondents received guests or visited at least several times a week before COVID-19 broke out on Canada's West Coast in March. After the death toll began mounting at several nursing homes - some of which were understaffed - publichealth officials and care-home providers banned all visitors in a desperate attempt to keep residents safe.
Now, as they vie for votes, B.C.'s political parties are grappling with how to best care for seniors and ensure such extreme action doesn't become normalized. But experts say their core infrastructure promises likely won't be enough to meet the future needs of the province's population of aging and ailing baby boomers.
In B.C., 175 people living in these facilities have died after contracting the virus and a further 750 residents and staff have tested positive. Fewer clusters have been forming in recent months and as seniors and staff make up a smaller percentage of total cases in B.C., families are pushing the Provincial Health Officer to expand visitation rights beyond a single designated person.
Ms. Mackenzie, who was appointed to the official seniors' watchdog position six years ago, said results from her office's extensive survey into the wellbeing of seniors will be released at the end of this month. Despite many respondents saying they visit regularly, she estimates roughly only a third of all people living in long-term care have friends or family that visited regularly before the pandemic threw their routines out the window. So accommodating more guests should not overwhelm these facilities, she said.
All three major political parties in the province agree that the current system of facilities is inadequate, but none could say exactly how many beds they would add.
The BC Liberals and the NDP are each pledging to invest at least a billion more dollars into the sector, if elected, to refurbish or build new facilities with single suites. The New Democrats would add $1.4-billion over a decade, focusing on public-owned facilities, while the Liberals say they will invest $1-billion in the next five years across all types of care homes. The Green Party has not supplied a figure, but says it is comfortable investing a billion dollars as it builds more public and non-profit beds and begins its plan to phase out private operators completely.
Experts in senior care say the current crisis in long-term care provides the perfect opportunity to completely overhaul the way homes are built and staffed.
Their consensus is that 20,000 new beds are needed across the province to house the wave of seniors needing such care over the coming decade.
Habib Chaudhury, chair of the gerontology faculty at Simon Fraser University, said the new funding proposals are a good first step, but he estimates that a billion dollars would only bring about 3,300 more single rooms online given each new bed costs roughly $300,000 in Canada.
Much of this money will likely go into upgrading the third of longterm care suites that house two or more people in the same room, Dr. Chaudhury said. (Ontario, in contrast, houses 67 per cent of its seniors in shared rooms, according to a recent study in the Canadian Medical Association Journal.)
Dan Levitt, executive director of the Tabor Village care home in Abbotsford and an adjunct professor of gerontology at Simon Fraser University, said any new facilities should involve nonprofits like his that can chip in real estate and complete fundraising campaigns. Older care homes that house a hundred people to a floor are petri dishes for further outbreaks and offer outdated levels of care to the people living there, he said.
"So why not - instead of institutions - make them small households, where 12 people live together and it's completely selfcontained," Dr. Levitt said.
Roger Wong, a clinical professor in geriatric medicine at the University of British Columbia, said improving the social interaction that seniors get to enjoy while in care is critical because the current climate of isolation is doing incredible harm.
"There are studies that have compared the negative impact of loneliness and isolation equivalent to smoking 15 cigarettes a day and shaving off eight years of life expectancy - which is huge," Dr. Wong said.
Ken Neuman said his wife had lost weight and appeared less able to speak when he restarted his daily drop-ins after her care home was locked off to all visitors in mid-March for several weeks.
Since he was let back in to act as Maureen's essential caregiver, he cherishes the 90 minutes it takes him to feed her breakfast.
He only ever sees slight glimpses of the accomplished pianist who once danced with glee, but knows she appreciates it when he tickles and teases her, like old times.
"I can still make her laugh," he says with pride.

Full text: No matter what happens on U.S. election day, no one will ever say that Donald Trump did not leave his mark on the world during his time as President of the United States.
In the Golan Heights, a goldon-brown sign, reminiscent of those that adorn his family's real estate properties around the world, welcomes visitors to a yetto-be-built Israeli settlement called Trump Heights. In the Balkans, a much more modest blueand-white banner has been draped over a bridge to tell visitors that they're approaching Lake Trump, an unorthodox renaming of a body of water that straddles the border between Serbia and Kosovo. In Poland, there's talk of calling a planned U.S. military base, which would play host to American troops redeployed from Germany, Fort Trump.
The settlement, lake and proposed military base named after Mr. Trump all commemorate decisions he made that rattled, rather than strengthened, the global order. Each monument will serve as a reminder of how difficult it will be - even if challenger Joe Biden wins the Nov. 3 election - to undo what has happened over the past four years.
Mr. Biden's campaign statements and track record suggest he would seek to return the United States to its traditional leadership role, promoting human rights and democracy, while countering the influence of authoritarian states such as China and Russia. He has promised to return the U.S. to the organizations and treaties that Mr. Trump quit - such as the World Health Organization and the Paris Agreement to combat climate change - and says he would hold a "Summit for Democracy" during his first year in office.
But if he is elected, Mr. Biden will inherit a world made wary of U.S. power and skeptical of its long-term intentions. Key institutions such as the NATO military alliance and the Group of Seven industrialized countries have been weakened over the past four years, while the likes of Chinese President Xi Jinping, Russian President Vladimir Putin and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan have all grown more assertive.
Mr. Biden was vice-president when Barack Obama first came to office in 2008, promising to change America's role in the world after the disastrous invasion of Iraq five years earlier. One of the supposed fixes was to "pivot" America's focus away from the Middle East and toward Asia and a rising China. If Mr. Biden makes it to the top job, he will need to contemplate an even more daunting realignment.
"Given the damage that Trump has done, Biden can't just say ‘I'm pivoting to the East.' He needs to be more active in Europe, in the Caucasus, in the Middle East, in Asia. That will be Biden's challenge," said Yossi Alpher, an Israeli political analyst and former Mossad agent.
Mr. Trump's presidency has unquestionably made an impact on regions, such as the Middle East, that he has an interest in.
His administration's biggest foreign-policy accomplishment may be this year's agreements to normalize ties between Israel and the Gulf kingdoms of the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. But peace agreements they are not. The UAE and Bahrain were never formally at war with Israel, and the deals do nothing to address the status of the Palestinians who have lived under Israeli military occupation since 1967.
This White House has often been more noticeable for its absence than its engagement on key international files such as the popular uprising in Belarus and the renewed fighting between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the disputed region of Nagorno-Karabakh. The latter conflict - which risks escalating into a regional war that could draw in Turkey, which has supported Azerbaijan, and Russia, which is treaty-bound to defend Armenia - would seem particularly ripe for Mr. Trump to play a role in solving, given his warm relationships with both Mr. Putin and Mr. Erdogan.
But Mr. Trump has yet to make a statement on either Belarus or Nagorno-Karabakh. "Never before has the U.S. been so much absent," said Olesya Vartanyan, a Caucasus analyst at the International Crisis Group, a Brusselsbased think tank. "Trump's administration never saw an interest in taking part in any efforts related to [the Nagorno-Karabakh] conflict."
Recognizing Israel's 1981 annexation of the Golan Heights, land most of the world considers part of Syria, was just one of many steps Mr. Trump took that undermined international law - and those moves empowered other disruptive actors. Two months after the sign went up at "Trump Heights" in June, 2019, India decided there was no reason why it shouldn't also unilaterally resolve an international dispute on its own terms, ending the autonomous status of the parts of disputed Kashmir under its control.
This year, Mr. Xi decided the timing was right to impose Chinese law on Hong Kong, abrogating a 1997 treaty that China had signed with Britain over the fate of the former British colony.
With each new development, those calling for Russia to give back the Crimean Peninsula - which it seized and annexed from Ukraine in 2014, on Mr. Obama's watch - saw their arguments weakened.
While support for Israel, and disdain for international institutions, didn't begin with Mr. Trump, the monuments in Europe celebrate Mr. Trump's brash willingness to ignore and insult long-time U.S. allies. Lake Trump is the biggest change to come out of a White House attempt to hammer out a peace agreement between Serbia and Kosovo, a peace push that saw the European Union cut out of the negotiations. (The U.S.-led talks have yielded little progress to date).
Fort Trump is the nickname given for a base that's only necessary because Mr. Trump decided to redeploy troops from Germany to Poland after Mr. Trump accused Germany of "not paying their bills." The decision to remove U.S.
troops from Germany is one of several steps Mr. Trump took that undermined the integrity of NATO, an alliance whose relevance he has repeatedly questioned. Meanwhile, the President divided the Group of Seven by repeatedly suggesting that Russia be readmitted, despite the annexation of Crimea and Mr. Putin's continuing military support for separatist fighters in eastern Ukraine, as well as Bashar al-Assad's regime in Syria.
"From a European perspective, the problem isn't Donald Trump, it's the American electorate," said Jasmin Mujanovic, an expert on the Balkans who cohosts the Sarajevo Calling podcast. In other words, even if Mr. Biden wins the Nov. 3 election, America's allies and rivals alike are left to wonder what kind of leader U.S. voters will elect in 2024 or 2028.
Ineffective gestures have been a hallmark of Mr. Trump's presidency. His first big effort on the international stage was a summit with Kim Jong-un that ended the North Korean despot's diplomatic isolation while doing nothing to slow his country's nuclear program. (The regime unveiled a new intercontinental ballistic missile at a military parade earlier this month.)
The most fraught foreign-policy move of his presidency may have been his January decision to order the assassination of General Qassem Soleimani, the leader of Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps, and the mastermind behind a series of Iranian advances and U.S. reversals across the Middle East over the preceding decade.
But Iran backed away from allout war in the first days of 2020, and instead stuck to Gen. Soleimani's strategy of slowly driving the U.S. out of the region through attacks on the U.S. embassy in Baghdad and other targets.
It's the U.S., not Iran, that now looks to be backing down. Amid continuing rocket attacks, the Trump administration has threatened to close the American embassy in the Iraqi capital.
(Mr. Biden has said he is ready to return to "the path of diplomacy" with Iran, suggesting a willingness to revisit the nuclear deal that Mr. Obama negotiated in 2015 and Mr. Trump abandoned three years later.)
Meanwhile, conflicts in Syria, Libya and Yemen have grown into regional proxy wars that have drawn in Russia, Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Iran, while the U.S.
keeps its military, diplomatic and economic tools on the sidelines.
Regional linchpin Lebanon is in chaos, but the U.S. appears content to let French President Emmanuel Macron do the hard work of trying to avoid another civil war there, too.
Perhaps the biggest loss of the past four years is the hardest to see. As Mr. Trump has cheered harsh police actions against protesters in the U.S., and ridiculed his country's media - and took only token action after Saudi agents killed Jamal Khashoggi, a critical journalist who was also a Washington Post columnist - it has become easier for authoritarians such as Mr. Xi, Mr. Putin and Mr. Erdogan to defend the repression of their own critics.
Yu Jie, a China specialist at London-based Chatham House, said that while future relations between Beijing and Washington will be rocky no matter who wins the Nov. 3 vote, China's leadership was likely more comfortable with Mr. Trump. His "erratic" style of rule, combined with wellpublicized episodes of police violence, and the U.S.'s bungled handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, have strengthened the Communist Party by making democracy look less appealing to ordinary Chinese, Ms. Yu said.
"Before Donald Trump came to power, the U.S. was looked up to by China's youngsters, who said ‘that's the place where I want to study.' Not now," Ms. Yu said. "They've made a comparison between the two systems and thought ‘perhaps this is safer for us, even if we don't have the political freedoms.' " But if the world has been set on a new course by the past four years, the monuments to Mr. Trump are likely to remain only if he defies the polls on Nov. 3.
The military base in Poland won't open until after the election, and almost certainly won't bear Mr. Trump's name if Mr. Biden wins. Locals in Serbia and Kosovo, Mr. Mujanovic said, have ignored the renaming of their lake, which Serbs call Gazivoda and Kosovars know as Ujman.
Meanwhile, construction has yet to begin at Trump Heights. In the 16 months after the new Golan settlement was announced to great fanfare, all but two letters have been stolen off the gold-onbrown sign. Mr. Alpher, the former Israeli intelligence officer, said he expected the moniker would disappear entirely if Mr. Biden wins the election. "If Trump loses, I don't think that name will stick."

Full text: For years, rural communities in British Columbia hollowed out while the urban centres in the southwest corner of the province - especially Metro Vancouver - generated most of province's economic growth. Schools in rural resource towns closed for lack of students, because the opportunities for jobs were flowing to the city.
Now COVID-19 has turned that upside down.
The arrival of the pandemic early in the year led to massive job losses in every region of the province. But B.C.'s resource industries - forestry, mining, oil and gas - have since rebounded. The fortunes of Metro Vancouver have not. And for many businesses and workers in the province's most densely populated region, there is stagnation, not recovery, on the horizon.
In the provincial election campaign now under way, voters are being asked to decide who can best manage the pandemic response. What they want to see from the parties will depend on where they live, because the path to recovery is different.
In the middle of the sprawling complex of Vancouver International Airport (YVR), a major expansion project has been idled halfway through construction. It's a visible sign of the changes COVID-19 has brought. YVR is at the heart of an airtransportation sector that was, until the start of the year, one of the engines of B.C.'s growth. In a normal year, it moves more than $10-billion through the economy, in both passengers and cargo. It is also a bellwether for the province's large hospitality sector, which relies on tourism and business travel. When the travel bans and lockdown measures began in March, the terminals emptied. In April, traffic dropped off by 97 per cent compared with the same month in 2019. It will be several years before the airport authority expects to see a recovery.
But in Quesnel, the forestry-dependent city in B.C.'s Interior, the economy is enjoying a boom. Not so long ago, the city of 10,000 was at the heart of a collapse in the forest industry. Today it is facing a rentalhousing crisis as the population swells - a trend that has accelerated since the arrival of the pandemic in B.C. as people chase opportunities that now can be found in rural B.C. Employers are struggling to find enough workers - line cooks, nurses, hotel managers. Forestry mills are hiring again, with more than two dozen full-time jobs currently posted at West Fraser's local operations. Homes are being snapped up at more than the asking price and contractors are running flat out to meet demand for renovations.
These two very different realities are being felt around the province. A recent report from the Business Council of B.C.
found proportionally, Metro Vancouver has been harder hit by the virus-driven recession than other parts of the province.
"By region, Metro Vancouver experienced B.C.'s steepest job losses because of its industrial and employment mix. Consumer-facing industries have been hammered and have an over-sized presence in the Lower Mainland," the Oct. 1 report found. Statistics Canada confirmed that trend on Friday, with new data showing employment in Metro Vancouver is 10.2 per cent below February levels, while outside of the metropolitan areas, employment in B.C. has increased by 2.6 per cent for the same period.
Tamara Vrooman is president and CEO of YVR. She made the decision to put construction of the new parkade on hold, leaving the airport with the equivalent of its front driveway ripped up. It had been launched in a period of growth - a record number of passengers moved through the airport in 2019. This year, she expects revenues will be down by 80 per cent over last year.
"The biggest challenge that we have is how to keep the sector functioning, so that we can maintain our staff and maintain our core operations, while we collectively deal with the pandemic until it's safe to reopen and welcome that demand again," she said. She is not speaking only of the airport and its major airlines, but of the many small companies - tourism operators and freight companies - that rely on this transport hub. The provincial government will have to play a role, she said, in building a bridge for this sector to make it to the other side.
Outside of those urban areas, the resource sectors have lifted B.C.'s communities back up. "Manufacturing, forestry, mining, oil and gas, and agriculture have regained all of the jobs lost since February - and then some. These industries are over-represented in non-metropolitan regions of B.C.," the business council found.
Quesnel Mayor Bob Simpson is welcoming new residents who have left Metro Vancouver for the jobs, open spaces, and relatively cheap real estate. He said COVID-19 has accelerated a shift that started three years ago.
"We're seeing some fundamental shifts in how people are living - they are realizing the big smoke isn't where they want to be," he said. But success brings its own challenges. "Our two pinch points as a community are, we don't have the housing stock to accommodate the people who are moving in, and we don't have the human resources to fill all the jobs."
British Columbia's two main parties, the Liberals and the NDP, are offering different solutions to economic recovery, but both focus on provincewide solutions.
The Liberals have not released their full platform, but promises to date include the elimination of the provincial sales tax for a year, with a reduced rate in the second year. That pledge would cost $10.8-billion in the first two years. They have also promised to permanently eliminate the 2per-cent small business income tax, and to offer a loan-guarantee program for the province's tourism and hospitality businesses.
Just days before the election was called, the NDP government announced a $2-billion pandemic recovery plan, which includes 55 programs - a mix of grants, training programs, and tax cuts. Business leaders have warned that the money is not yet flowing, and could come too late for some.
In the campaign, the NDP has focused on promises that would help people who work in the hard-hit service industry, including a cash payout of up to $1,000 for eligible British Columbians and a rent supplement. They are also offering more job training to help workers make the transition to in-demand jobs. Forecasters project that British Columbia's economy, over all, will begin to recover in 2021. But the business council's economist, Ken Peacock, said this won't be spread out evenly and Metro Vancouver will be slower to recover.
"We fully expect more business failures here in the fall months and 2021," he said.
"They've been propped up by government funding, but as that winds up, and if we're in a half-open situation in business and restaurants, there are going to be more bankruptcies," he said. "There's so much lost revenue, and so many smaller businesses hurt. And that is going to weigh on this employment recovery process."
Metro Vancouver shed 150,000 jobs this year. On Thursday, the Greater Vancouver Board of Trade released the results of a survey showing its members fear the coming year will bring more bad news. One in four businesses do not expect to survive another year under the current economic conditions.
In this election, the board is asking the parties to commit to a series of changes that could soften the blow. They want more action on the availability and affordability of housing, more skills-training opportunities and faster access to programs that would help small and medium-sized businesses stay afloat.
The town of Port McNeill, on the north end of Vancouver Island, bills itself as British Columbia's forestry capital. It was only just starting to recover from a devastating strike that shut down the region's forest operations for almost eight months, when the pandemic arrived. Tourism has suffered but, on the strength of a rebounding forest sector, new businesses are opening up. Mixed with that confidence, however, is some caution.
The experience of the pandemic has shaken things up, said Port McNeill Mayor Gaby Wickstrom. She wants her community to prepare for the future by pursuing a more diverse economy.
"I would like to see less forestry-reliant businesses. We could have anything, a call centre, a Kicking Horse coffee company," she said. "COVID smashed everybody's boxes, and that allows people to look at our community in a new way, to be open to new way of doing things."

Full text: 6476 Blenheim St.
VANCOUVER Asking Price: $12-million Taxes: $20,629.40 (2020) Lot Size: one-half acre Agents: Jamie MacDougall, Engel & Volkers THE BACKSTORY The house at 6476 Blenheim St.
was one of the original farmhouses in the bucolic West Vancouver neighbourhood known as Southlands. Today, the neighbourhood has a mix of residential and agricultural land, with riding clubs and trails for equestrians.
The circa-1912 farmhouse had changed very little over the years when Ron and Helen Gerrard purchased the property about 11 years ago.
"We loved that farmhouse look," says Mr. Gerrard, who trained as a carpenter before building his own commercial construction business.
He was keen to tackle the challenge of renovating the historic home, which is protected under local conservation rules.
The appearance of the exterior must remain true to the original, Mr. Gerrard explains, but regulations allow for substantial changes to the interior.
The couple spent one year renovating the residence, with lots of hurdles to overcome along the way.
When Mr. Gerrard and the builders began tearing walls and floors apart, they discovered that flimsy floor joists had caused the bedroom level to sag. Renovations done by previous owners had also removed some structural elements.
"We took off the whole of the upper floor," he says. "How could we maintain it when it's collapsing?" Similarly, when they examined the basement, they saw that the main floor was sagging.
Mr. Gerrard brought in an engineer and replaced the old joists with sturdy support beams. A large steel I-beam now props up the main floor. Plaster and lathe was torn from the walls and the main floor was reconfigured with an open plan.
"The whole of the interior was demolished," he says. "We redid it top to bottom."
THE HOUSE TODAY The home has been reconfigured with 5,449 square feet of living space. An additional guest suite above the garage adds another 500 square feet.
Today, the main floor has a kitchen and breakfast area, a living and dining room, and a home office. A former bedroom has been turned into the family room.
"When we did the demolition, we could put the walls wherever we wanted."
Throughout the house, Mr. Gerrard replaced old windows with new windows with stained glass. He added tongue-andgroove boards and wood trim in keeping with the home's heritage.
"It gave us the rustic look we wanted."
Drywall wasn't available at the turn of the previous century, he points out, so the kitchen has walls of reclaimed brick with a rustic finish in the mortar.
"We thought that would add some character to the house and give it that farmhouse feel."
That soapstone countertops are from a quarry on Vancouver Island, and a Heartland range is also in keeping with the era.
Upstairs, there's a primary bedroom with ensuite bathroom, two additional bedrooms and a family bathroom.
The steep pitch of the roof made the upstairs bedrooms feel enclosed, so Mr. Gerrard added dormers.
The basement didn't have much use when the Gerrards bought the house, so they created two additional bedrooms, a craft room and a large wine cellar and tasting room.
Mr. Gerrard, who often plays host to fellow members of his wine club for blind tastings, says the cellar can hold more than 3,000 bottles.
"It's the pride and joy, that room."
On the peak of the roof, Mr. Gerrard installed a skylight and added ornamental trim so that it resembles a widow's walk.
The skylight illuminates the staircase that runs between the three levels.
"It shines all the way down to the basement," Mr. Gerrard says.
Mr. Gerrard also modernized all of the systems in the house.
When it came to updating the hot water heating system, he added weather-sensing technology.
There were existing cast iron radiators but not enough for the new interior, so Mr. Gerrard had them replicated by a company in Quebec.
Mr. Gerrard wanted to use Douglas fir for the floors, so he located a sawmill that had stored the remains of an 800-year-old tree that came down on Vancouver Island in the devastating windstorm that hit the southern coast of British Columbia in 2006.
"I tracked it down and got them to mill it into one-[inch]by-six-[inch] boards. We put it into a kiln and dried it out."
The newel posts and handrails of the new staircase also came from the ancient fir.
Mr. Gerrard visited antique shops to find the fireplace surrounds and tiles, as well as the light fixtures.
In keeping with the age of the home, Mr. Gerrard chose chalkbased Farrow and Ball paint in heritage colours for the walls and a waxed finish for the wood floors. The door handles and hinges are oiled brass.
Mr. Gerrard is not in favour of renovations where the interior of a home does not match the age of the exterior.
"That's a travesty that you go inside and it's a modern house."
He hopes the next owners of the old farmhouse will hold the period charm in high regard.
"It needs a discerning buyer that can appreciate the attention to detail."
The Southlands area has prestigious golf courses nearby and the Fraser River is a short walk away. Many of the larger properties in the area have horses and stables, he adds.
THE BEST FEATURE After one year of restoring the house, the Gerrards spent another year working on the grounds.
A covered veranda wraps around the exterior of the house, and there are plenty of other places to sit and relax amid the trees, lush perennial gardens, pergolas, fountains and statues.
Mr. Gerrard located a large quantity of reclaimed vintage bricks and had workers scrape off the mortar so they could be used in the patio, footpaths and garage.
There's also an outdoor kitchen, fire pit and pizza oven.
A replica of a barn serves as a storage shed, and there's a potting shed and greenhouse.
The plants and flower beds are the domain of Ms. Gerrard.
"We have flowers that bloom all through the seasons," Mr. Gerrard says.
The couple needed to replace trees, so they had mature specimens lifted in by crane.
There's a willow, two white oaks and other varieties on the property. Boxwood encloses the gardens.
"It makes it very private."

Critical care for a former hospital site: ARCHITOURIST

Full text: It's an odd bedroom for sure.
With a bathroom on one end and a jog with stairs to the main living area on the other, standing in this long, ultraskinny space, one feels as if one is floating away from the rest of the complex. Plus, to be less esoteric, where will the bed go? No matter, the views to be enjoyed by the new tenants (professional bowlers, maybe?), are quite spectacular.
"It's a real problematic space," developer Amit Sofer says.
"You're in the bridge, but the option was to demolish this, which would've cost more, and lose the space. The thing is, every unit in all of our buildings is different, so that's what gives the architects all kinds of problems - and free reign to create."
Perhaps that's why the St. Joseph's Hospital campus in the East City neighbourhood of Peterborough, Ont., changed hands three times after being offered for sale in the mid-2000s before Mr. Sofer's TVM Group purchased it in late 2009. Ask any structural engineer, developer, or architect, and you'll get the collective Greek Chorus: Purpose-built, utilitarian buildings, such as churches or grain silos, do not convert easily to other uses - especially warmand-cozy residential.
So, this hodge-podge of buildings, bridges, tunnels and additions to buildings - which range in age from 1922 to the 1970s - could've been an architectural dog's breakfast in the wrong hands.
Instead, Jonathan King of BNKC Architects (Phases 4 and 5), and Paul Shields (Phases 1 to 3) have created an inviting, thriving complex of 21st-century rental apartments. And Mr. Sofer and Mr. King are now offering an ownership opportunity vis-à-vis the soon-to-rise, nine-storey tower, East City Condos, at the northeastern corner of the site.
To wit, a walkabout of two of the buildings - one complete and the other ready in December - rewards the eye with features that are easy to spot, such as higherthan-average ceilings, deep windowsills, LED pot lights and luxury bathrooms and kitchens. Look a little closer, however, and the keen aficionado can identify the various challenges that have been overcome: flooring changes that have been smoothed; odd room sizes that have been massaged into domesticity, and toowide hallways (so that two gurneys could pass in either direction) that now allow for multiple bicycle storage inside the unit, and, outside, undulating walls that add visual interest.
Where possible, vintage items, such as terrazzo stairways and the oldest operating elevator in the city of Peterborough, have been retained.
A walk through the basement of the under-construction building, where original plaster walls, door openings and scarred quarry tile floors are on offer, and one gets the sense of just how much work has been done elsewhere, and why other developers shied away. "Down here we had to remove a lot of structural walls, so we had to install a lot of structural beams. It was fairly complex down here," Mr. Sofer says.
"The city really wanted the properties to be brought back to life rather than demolished," he says, "so they came up with a suite of community incentive programs - waiver of development charges and things like that - that in the absence of I don't think we would've been able to make these projects work."
"I think what's also made this possible is that Amit is prepared to get his hands dirty," Mr. King says, "and has gotten his hands dirty in making sure that every single brick that could be retained is retained. ... He has a vested interest in maintaining the fabric of this community."
Mr. Sofer also has an interest in helping the less fortunate and those with mobility challenges.
Even before he and his team got to work on the two-hectare hospital property, his company was transforming surplus schools and vacant commercial buildings into homes for the Canadian Mental Health Association and victims of domestic violence.
When it came time for Phase 1 at St. Joe's, the 1947 Nurse's Residence, the building was transformed into 30 fully accessible suites (wide corridors, roll-under sinks, roll-in showers et cetera) and the ground floor was leased to Community Care Peterborough, which runs the local Meals on Wheels among other services.
Other uses would've brought in more money, so why do it?
"Writing a cheque has been the easy way out of our social obligations, and we never really felt good about the efficiency with which that money was dispensed," Mr. Sofer explains. "We service both ends of the marketplace, and it gives us our balance."
When Phase 4 is completed, Mr. Sofer will have created 159 accessible and luxury rentals to a city that had precious few. Phase 5, the condo, will add 93 ownership units to the mix, plus a coffee shop on the ground floor.
Eventually, the site's old power plant will be transformed into something special. And, most importantly, what was once a proud health care community will have become a proud community of individuals, many with personal ties to the buildings they inhabit.
"We've had lots of connection with the original Sisters of St. Joseph. ... They still come in and they walk through to see what our finished product looks like," Mr. Sofer says. "And everyone who works for us was born in one of these buildings, pretty much, [or] were there when they broke their leg, [or] their uncle passed away in that room.
"So we are proud to preserve it."

Full text: Bob Aggarwal is a rare species in this year's U.S. presidential election: an undecided voter.
A commercial banker in Scottsdale, Ariz., Mr. Aggarwal supported Barack Obama before voting for Donald Trump in 2016.
Since then, he has seen how the economy flourished before the pandemic. Companies flocked to Maricopa County - the sprawling suburbs encompassing Phoenix and Scottsdale - and Mr. Aggarwal has done well financing their business expansions and real estate deals. The region's economy even appears to have weathered the COVID-19 shutdowns, he says.
But as a first-generation American whose parents emigrated from India, Mr. Aggarwal also supports equality and the Black Lives Matter movement. He is uneasy with Mr. Trump's rhetoric attacking immigrants and casting racialjustice protesters as violent radicals. His 13-year-old daughter, inspired that California Senator Kamala Harris could become the first female vice-president of Indian heritage, wants him to vote for Joe Biden.
So, with just weeks to go before the election, Mr. Aggarwal is struggling to pick a presidential candidate.
"I tell my wife we've probably got to vote in the direction that's going to favour us from [an economic] standpoint, regardless of what the other platforms say," Mr. Aggarwal said as he watched his son play soccer in a Scottsdale park. "But I don't know if I'm comfortable with that really, when I say it. So I'm torn."
When the ballots are counted after the Nov. 3 election, it is moderate suburban voters like Mr. Aggarwal who could be the deciding factor.
Mr. Trump is staking his reelection on once again mobilizing the Republican base of white working-class and rural voters who sent him to the White House in 2016.
Democrats are hoping Mr. Biden can inspire a winning coalition of racially diverse and urban voters who failed to turn out for Hillary Clinton.
Those battle lines meet in suburbs such as Maricopa County and others in the traditionally conservative Sun Belt - the temperate southern region stretching from Florida to California - where an influx of new residents is quickly reshaping the political landscape.
Mr. Trump narrowly won the suburbs in 2016. But many of those same voters delivered him a swift rebuke in the midterms two years later, helping Democrats regain a majority in the House of Representatives. That year, voters in Maricopa County were largely responsible for Arizona sending its first Democratic senator to Washington in three decades. Recent polls suggest a close presidential race in Arizona, though one that has widened in favour of Mr. Biden. Should the former vice-president win, it will be only the second time Arizona has voted for a Democratic presidential candidate in 70 years.
Academics who study the shifting politics of suburban America point to the changing nature of the suburbs themselves. As workers - including large numbers of college-educated professionals - migrate to suburbs around the big cities of the South and West, those communities are increasingly resembling the cities they border, says Robert Lang, a professor of public policy at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.
The construction of light-rail systems and other transportation links that shuttle suburbanites into neighbouring cities has encouraged the development of high-density, mixed-use neighbourhoods around train stations, urbanizing what were once uniformly middle-class neighbourhoods of single-family homes.
Those neighbourhoods, in turn, have attracted a greater diversity of residents: lower-income renters mixing with young families and residents of retirement communities.
"There's a myth that the suburbs are financially stable, white communities and that's not true," said Samara Klar, a political scientist at the University of Arizona who studies how voters form their political attitudes.
"The suburbs are really diverse - and that may be especially true in Arizona."
As they have grown to become more urban and more diverse, suburbs have also become more politically aligned with nearby cities than the rural regions and small cities elsewhere in their states, experts say.
"Those suburbs are urban enough to be in the urban mix," said Prof. Lang, who co-authored Blue Metros, Red States, a book released this month that examines the political realignment taking place in many suburbs. "There's enough of them and they're growing fast enough that they're changing the dynamic of the country."
That phenomenon is not happening everywhere, particularly not in the slow-growing Midwestern suburbs of cities such as Detroit, Milwaukee and Cleveland. But it is playing out in in the suburbs of Texas, North Carolina, Georgia and Colorado - fast-growing regions that once delivered reliable majorities for Republicans.
Maricopa County embodies many of these changes. The region is home to more than 60 per cent of Arizona's population and nearly two-thirds of its registered voters. It started a light-rail system in 2008 that runs 45 kilometres from Phoenix through the communities of Tempe and Mesa and is currently undergoing its third expansion in little more than a decade. Developers have flocked to the downtowns of Phoenix and Scottsdale to build mixed-use neighbourhoods of high-rise condos, rental apartments, retail and dining.
The region's population has increased by 700,000 in the past decade - making it the fastestgrowing metropolitan area in the country. That population growth is being fuelled by rising numbers of Latino families and an influx of workers from liberal states such as California and Illinois drawn to jobs at PayPal, Intel, Wells Fargo and an array of head offices for insurance, medical and defence firms. Many are bringing their politics with them.
Giovanni Bray, 27, moved to the Phoenix area from Milwaukee, Wis., in early September, only a few weeks after protests erupted over the police shooting of Jacob Blake in nearby Kenosha, Wis.
He came at the urging of his mother, who had moved three months earlier to Chandler, a middle-class suburb of Phoenix known for its good schools and ample jobs in the corporate offices lining the Price Road Corridor. "It's quiet. It's peaceful. Everyone keeps to themselves," he said. "It's a place where you can grow and prosper and make your own money and be at peace."
Mr. Bray, who is Black, graduated earlier this year from Stillman College, a historically Black school, with plans to become a physical therapist, though he's now working at an auto-parts store.
Coming from Milwaukee, he says he is worried about the heated debate over police brutality and racial justice, but mainly he is concerned about his economic prospects.
Yet when Mr. Bray brings up economic issues, he does not sound like Mr. Aggarwal, whose preference for tax cuts and low interest rates is nudging him toward Mr. Trump.
Instead, Mr. Bray worries about growing income inequality, fears that are pushing him toward Mr. Biden. "I want the economy to be where it's balanced to the point where a lower-class person is just as well off as the middle class," he said. "I don't want there to be a lower class."
The influx of new residents from more liberal parts of the country has caused tensions among some long-time residents of Maricopa County, who fear that newcomers attracted by Arizona's low taxes and affordable-housing costs will end up voting for policies that destroy both.
"California is run by Democrats. There's no Republicans anywhere," said Jim Borchardt, 60, a Trump supporter from Chandler who works as a helicopter mechanic and is worried about the future of his retirement. He knows of at least two families that have moved into his neighbourhood recently from California. "We're concerned that they're going to bring that here and turn Arizona
into California."
Two state-level proposals on the ballot in November speak to those political tensions. Analysts expect a measure to legalize marijuana to bring out conservative voters opposed to the idea.
Meanwhile, a proposed tax hike on those making more than $250,000 - to pay for public schools - is expected to pass because of widespread support from young families moving into the region in search of good education options.
Mr. Trump has staked his reelection campaign on messages designed to appeal to conservative suburban voters: touting the country's economic growth in the years before COVID-19 threatened to plunge the U.S. into an extended recession, and warning that Democrats will defund suburban police departments.
"The ‘suburban housewife' will be voting for me. They want safety," the President tweeted in August, adding that "low income housing would invade their neighborhood" if Mr. Biden got elected.
In Maricopa County, similar messages have shown up on freeway billboards that read: "Moms trust police. Police trust Trump" and in television ads in which women call 911 only to be told: "To report a rape, please press 1. To report a murder, press 2."
Law and order messages do resonate with some voters, says Prof. Klar, the University of Arizona political scientist. But Arizonans are far more concerned with how the presidential candidates propose handling a pandemic that has closed schools and shuttered businesses.
Worry about violent protests going on in some U.S. cities "is an issue where Republicans in Arizona agree with Trump, and maybe agree with what he's been doing and saying," she said. "But it's also not even close to the most important issue to them."
Dog-whistle messages about low-income housing invading single-family neighbourhoods go over particularly poorly in urbanizing communities such as Scottsdale, Prof. Lang says. Here, suburban women are more likely to be school principals and partners in law firms than housewives, he says. Such voters may still be conservative on some issues, but they also tend to be tolerant and open to racial diversity.
"They say: ‘Hey I live in this diverse world. I've accepted diversity. I see it at work. I see it in my community. I don't want to have this hostility toward people,' " he said. "They don't feel very secure with a [President] who is dividing their community."
Scottsdale's Sean Geraghty, 59, describes himself as an "independent-thinking, socially liberal and fiscally conservative" voter who plans to vote for Mr. Biden.
A data scientist who once worked for Nortel Networks, Mr. Geraghty is concerned that Mr. Trump's law-and-order rhetoric is needlessly trying to stoke racial animosity in communities like his. "There's racial inequality in this world," he said. "There are people who try to deny that for political purposes. And that's just wrong."
Recently, Mr. Geraghty's 15year-old son, who runs track and field, told him of a fellow teammate who wasn't allowed to run with him in the evenings, when the searing Arizona temperatures cool down enough to safely exercise. His teammate, who is African-American, said his parents felt it was too dangerous for a Black teenage boy to be on the streets after dark.
"I don't give a second thought for my son to run at night. But when he's telling me this story about his friend, it's like wow, even to this day African-American parents have to teach their kids how to behave," he said.
"My kids do not have to have those same lessons."
One consequence of Mr. Trump's racially charged rhetoric is to turn off moderate conservative voters in Maricopa County who might otherwise be willing to support a Republican president.
Republicans still hold a slight advantage in voter registrations in the county. Many gravitated to the party because of its ethos of individual freedom and strong national defence, but don't embrace the culture wars that appeal to Mr. Trump's base.
"It's not just demographic changes. You don't go from Mitt Romney winning [the county] by 12 per cent to Donald Trump winning by 3.5 per cent in just the space of a couple of years," said Jeff Flake, the former Republican senator from Arizona.
"There is a kind of aversion to Trumpian politics, which is, I think, a credit to the citizens of Arizona."
Republicans and Democrats in Arizona both view their state parties as more moderate than their national counterparts, Prof.
Klar says. More importantly, voters tend to view themselves as more moderate, even if they don't always fall in the centre of the ideological spectrum on every issue.
That is particularly true among political independents - who make up nearly a third of Maricopa County's registered voters. People who register as independents are often just as partisan as card-carrying party members, but tend to dislike the polarizing political battles, said Prof. Klar, co-author of Independent Politics: How American Disdain for Parties Leads to Political Inaction.
"What really turns off independent voters is the sort of aggressive rhetoric, the insurmountable conflict between the two parties," she said. "These are the kinds of things that make people who do have partisan preferences tell others that they're independent."
Voters in Maricopa County repeatedly express disdain for Mr. Trump's personality and the partisanship that has engulfed national politics. But many also don't seem to have been convinced to support Mr. Biden.
"It's the rhetoric. The state of the country right now is kind of weird," said Steve Hosfield, an engineer at a telecommunications company who voted for Mr. Trump in 2016, but is on the fence this year. He faults both parties for feeding into the partisan divide. "Biden blames Trump. Trump blames Biden," said Mr. Hosfield, who lives in Chandler. "But I don't see either one of them doing anything about it."
Jaime Thomas, a lifelong Republican who moved to Phoenix from Atlanta seven years ago, plans to vote for Martha McSally, the Republican running for one of Arizona's seats in the U.S. Senate, but leave her vote for president blank.
She doesn't support Mr. Biden, whom she considers to be someone with little to show for 40 years in office. But she also doesn't like Mr. Trump's demeanor. "I wish he would stay off Twitter," said Ms. Thomas, who considers herself a libertarian. "I think that he thinks it's a way of connecting with voters. But I feel like in a lot of cases, less is more."
Ultimately, the results in Maricopa County might turn on how many Republican voters like Ms. Thomas are planning to sit out this presidential election. "The risk for Republicans in Arizona is that Republican voters are just not going to turn out if they're not excited about their candidates," Prof Klar said.
In some cases, Republican voters in the region have started campaigning for the other side.
Steven Jackson, 35, grew up in Illinois and spent years in Hawaii after joining the U.S. Army, where he was seriously injured during a 2008 deployment to Iraq.
In 2010, he followed his exwife to Arizona, where he now works as an estate-planning and probate lawyer in Scottsdale.
A Republican for much of his life, Mr. Jackson said he was drawn to the party's positions on national security and foreign policy.
He voted for John McCain over Barack Obama in 2008 and worked on campaigns for moderate Republican candidates in Arizona.
But he has felt increasingly alienated from the party as it has moved toward the right, a political evolution that has been hastened by the Trump presidency.
So this year, Mr. Jackson began volunteering to conduct voter outreach for Democrats.
"For years, I was like: ‘It will come back to the middle. It will come back to the middle,' " he said of the Republican Party. "I don't think a lot of Republicans could see how far right things had become until Trump became President."
Despite Republican rhetoric painting Mr. Biden as beholden to the radical left, Democrats have found some success running centrist candidates in Arizona, while moderate Republicans have often faced gruelling primaries against more extreme challengers.
In 2018, Democrat Kyrsten Sinema narrowly won the U.S. Senate race against Ms. McSally. Ms. Sinema touted herself as an independent. Ms. McSally, who had a reputation as a moderate when she served in U.S. Congress, ran a campaign that embraced Mr. Trump - a position she adopted after struggling through a primary against two right-wing competitors, one of whom is now the chair of the Arizona Republican Party.
That dynamic is playing itself out once again this year. Ms. McSally, who was appointed to fill the Senate seat left vacant when John McCain died in 2018, is again running a campaign that echoes much of Mr. Trump's rhetoric.
Her Democratic competitor, Mark Kelly, is an astronaut married to former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot in the head in a 2011 ambush during a political event in Tucson. He is largely following Ms. Sinema's 2018 playbook by framing himself "Not as a partisan, but as a patriot."
He now leads Ms. McSally by roughly 10 percentage points in polls. If Mr. Kelly wins, it will be the first time Arizona has sent two Democrats to the Senate in almost 70 years.
Mr. Flake, whose former seat Ms. Sinema won in 2018, sees his party's embrace of Trumpian politics as particularly damaging to Republican's prospects in suburbs like Maricopa County.
Republicans once ran competitive moderate candidates here, backed by money from local business groups. But as the party has shifted right under Mr. Trump, the business community has stopped donating, alienated by the party's embrace of antiimmigrant, protectionist policies. That has forced many congressional candidates to turn to the national Republican Party for funding - requiring them to pledge their loyalty to Mr. Trump.
"That's a vicious cycle that many of the states are in now," Mr. Flake said. "The President has made it very difficult downballot."
He fears that Mr. Trump is forcing Republicans into a losing "demographic cul-de-sac" of older, white voters who no longer reflect the views of their rapidly diversifying country. "If we have four more years of the President, wow, I mean Texas could go blue by then," he said. "And try to win nationally when Texas, New York and California are reliably blue."
Some political analysts see an opportunity for Mr. Trump and Republicans to regain the healthy electoral majorities they once won easily in places such as Maricopa County. But that would require ditching the divisive social issues and returning to the bread-and-butter policies that matter to many suburban voters.
"The message they could switch on would be the end of this sort of stridency on race," Prof. Lang said.
"They have to come out and say: We're going to move on with our message about free enterprise and not try to gin up the white base."
For voters like Mr. Aggarwal, who says he no longer watches the news because it has become too politically polarized, time is running out for the presidential campaigns to capture his vote.
Asked whether there is something either candidate could do or say to sway him, Mr. Aggarwal falls into a lengthy silence.
"There should be," he said finally. "I should have something that should convince me. I just care for what's best for my kids."

Full text: In Canada's last downturn, the global financial crisis that played out 12 years ago, government spending on infrastructure came too late to stimulate the economy and get people back to work.
SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. chief executive Ian Edwards wants to ensure politicians of all stripes learn from past mistakes. The head of one of the world's largest engineering companies launched a campaign last week that stresses the need for speed on domestic construction projects.
Mr. Edwards is calling on federal, provincial and local governments to adopt innovative approaches to technology and decision-making, the same sort of tactics that allowed SNC to get Montreal's 3.4-kilometre Champlain Bridge built in four years, when the link was originally expected to take seven years. In an interview ahead of a speech in Montreal last week, Mr. Edwards said: "The point we want to make is there is a better way to deliver infrastructure."
To kick-start the economy, politicians should prioritize easily achievable projects such as electrifying rail lines or renovating public buildings to improve their environmental performance, said Mr. Edwards, who is giving another speech promoting infrastructure spending to a virtual business audience in Toronto this week. He said these shovel-ready undertakings tick a number of boxes for government - they get people to work quickly and they anchor a greener economy.
"We see government intent to build infrastructure as a form of stimulus everywhere we operate, in Canada, the U.S. and U.K.," Mr. Edwards said. He said he heard some brave talk from politicians during the financial downturn of 2007-09, but "a lot of infrastructure investments were not even approved until after the crisis was over, missing a valuable window of opportunity."
The Canada Infrastructure Bank, a $35-billion federal agency created three years ago, is also putting a priority on retrofitting buildings to improve their efficiency. Under recently appointed chair Michael Sabia, former CEO of the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, the bank earmarked $2-billion last moth for real estate projects with private-sector partners, with the bank shouldering the upfront costs on renovations where the long-term cost savings are difficult to determine.
Mr. Edwards is the first to acknowledge that when it comes to infrastructure spending, what's good for Canada is also good for SNC.
Government contracts account for two-thirds of the company's revenues. The importance of public projects will also rise in the future, as SNC winds down a money-losing division that builds infrastructure for resource companies.
However, as a global player, Mr. Edwards said SNC is well-positioned to import the best practices from governments in other countries, such as Australia and Britain, to Canadian projects.
"In Australia, a leader in infrastructure, you've seen government develop the concept of alliancing, where contractors are on the same team as the client, and they develop objectives together," said Mr. Edwards, adding it is encouraging to see government agencies in British Columbia, Quebec and Ontario taking a similar partnership approach.
SNC recruited Mr. Edwards six years ago from one of Asia's largest construction companies, Leighton Group. SNC named the British-trained engineer as chief operating officer early in 2019, then promoted him to CEO last October. In December, Mr. Edwards played a leading role in resolving corruption allegations against SNC.
Canada's construction industry is increasing its use of technology to speed up work and incorporate hard-tomeasure environmental criteria into projects, and Mr. Edwards wants to see governments reflect the value of these innovations when awarding contracts. "The current model is not designed to harness the potential of digital, data and new technologies," he said.
For example, the pandemic is proving the value of "digital twinning," which allows engineers to test the design and delivery of largescale projects remotely. And the $4.4-billion Champlain Bridge project showed the value of modular construction, with SNC simultaneously building components at facilities across Quebec, then assembling them like Lego pieces above the St. Lawrence River.
When SNC bids on government work, there's no allowance for these skills. Mr. Edwards said: "The unintended consequence is to discourage technology adoption."

Full text: Toronto's housing market soared in September, another month where sales and prices hit record highs, with low mortgage rates enticing buyers despite the worsening coronavirus crisis.
Last month, 11,083 homes sold in the Toronto region, a 42-percent increase over September of last year, according to the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board (TRREB), with a notable surge in activity in the suburbs and regions surrounding the city of Toronto. That was the third straight month of record sales volumes.
Competition for detached and semi-detached houses helped send the average selling price across all types of properties up 14 per cent to $960,772, compared with the previous year. Prices have been climbing month over month since May, after the slowdown in April when non-essential activity was halted to stop the virus from spreading.
The home price index, which adjusts for the highest-price properties, also reached a record high of $897,700, an increase of 11.6 per cent over September of last year.
"The Greater Toronto Area is still white hot," said Simeon Papailias, a realtor with Royal LePage Signature Realty, who said properties continue to fetch multiple offers and sell $50,000 to $100,000 over the asking price.
"Money continues to be cheaper and cheaper," he said.
Mortgage rates are at record lows, with the five-year fixed rate below 2 per cent. That has lowered monthly payments for mortgage holders, as well as made it easier for homeowners to pay down the principal debt on their homes.
More homeowners put their properties up for sale compared with September of last year, sending the overall number of active listings up slightly.
Despite the new listings, competition is fierce for low-rise properties, where there is more square footage and easier access to outdoor space. The regions surrounding the city of Toronto experienced the steepest price increases. North of the city, in the area close to Lake Simcoe, the home price index was up 20 per cent year over year. To the east in Durham region, the price index climbed 17 per cent and to the west in the Halton area, the index rose by 14 per cent.
Meanwhile, demand for condos in downtown Toronto has softened as the normal cohort of renters, including post-secondary students, shrinks because of the pandemic restrictions. One-bedroom rental rates have declined by at least 20 per cent since the start of the health crisis, according to local brokers. If the city continues to roll back the economic reopening and rental rates continue to weaken, Mr. Papailias said prices for condo resales would start to ease. "If this continues ... you will start to see pricing go down," he said.
The average price of a condo in the city rose to $686,191, up 7 per cent from September last year. In comparison, sales of townhouses increased by 22 per cent, semi-detached houses were up by 49 per cent and detached properties were up by 28 per cent.
In the surrounding suburbs and regions, sales of detached houses were up 64 per cent, closely followed by other low-rise homes.
Meanwhile, the national housing agency has predicted the average selling price to fall between 9 per cent and 18 per cent, in the most dire pandemic scenario.
The Toronto region is dealing with a second wave of coronavirus cases and local medical officials are urging the province to further restrict activity. As well, some of the mortgage deferrals that were arranged earlier in the pandemic are expiring this month. The combination of pandemic restrictions, sustained unemployment and homeowners unable to make their debt payment could curtail Toronto's surging residential real estate market.

Full text: It's just before the lunch-hour rush and customers are beginning to file into Sharon's Place, a family diner near the water in Pictou where the kitchen is busy pushing out orders of lobster burgers and butterscotch pie.
They're greeted by Sharon Stewart, the restaurant's owner, who calls everyone "honey" or "darlin' " as she points them toward the hand sanitizer. To get a seat in one of her plexiglassshielded booths, you need to wear a mask, be without COVID-19 symptoms and provide your name and number for contact tracing.
"We don't have any cases here, and we want to keep it that way," explained Ms. Stewart, wiping down tables and chairs in between guests.
Across Atlantic Canada, there are many people who share that sentiment.
As other parts of the country struggle with a second wave of COVID-19 that could be more punishing than the first, the four eastern provinces have managed to keep the pandemic at bay and even relaxed a social gathering limit Thursday, with a mixture of good fortune, public co-operation and some of the toughest publichealth rules in Canada.
The region has reported just a handful of infections in the past month, all of them tied to people travelling outside Atlantic Canada. There has been little more than 1,610 cases of the disease in the Atlantic provinces since March, compared with more than 154,000 in the rest of Canada.
The death toll has been dramatically smaller, too - COVID-19 has claimed 70 lives in the region, while it has killed more than 9,200 people in the rest of Canada.
All but 17 of those deaths in the Atlantic provinces were connected to the same outbreak at Halifax's Northwood nursing home.
Collectively, the region has some of the lowest infection rates in the world, far better than most developed countries.
New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island, with rates of around 25 and 36 cases per 100,000 people, respectively, are doing better than New Zealand, which is held up as a model for success in controlling COVID-19.
While other parts of the country clamp back down in response to new outbreaks, here restrictions are easing. On Thursday, Nova Scotia changed the rules to allow groups of 50 people to gather without physical distancing for performing arts and sports.
It has not been without sacrifices, however. For months, despite a low rate of infections, almost everyone travelling from outside Atlantic Canada has been required to self-isolate for 14 days upon entry - a rule that has been particularly hard on the tourism and hospitality sectors.
PEI's tourism association says businesses have been devastated by the drop in visitors, with overnight stays in hotels and campgrounds down 64 per cent in July from 2019. Tourism Nova Scotia estimates tourism revenue could drop by $1.7-billion in 2020 compared with last year. Given the low rates of infection, calls are growing daily in the business community to reduce restrictions that are keeping customers away.
The two-week quarantine rule was brought in by the provinces themselves, in addition to a federal rule that requires visitors from outside Canada to self-isolate.
No other part of the country, with the exception of the Northwest Territories, has taken quarantine restrictions that far.
Some people have complained the travel restrictions are heavy-handed, and they've prompted at least one legal challenge, from the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, which argued the restrictions violate the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.
But the results are also hard to argue with. With few local infections, the economies of the Atlantic provinces are reopening at a faster rate than any other part of Canada. Schools have resumed without incident and customers are returning to many restaurants and bars again, albeit at reduced capacities.
"Compared to the rest of Canada, we're lucky. We have almost a normal life. I can go to the pub, I can go to a restaurant, I can go shopping, and I don't have to wear a mask," said Roger Ouellette, a professor of political science at the University of Moncton. "We have had good management of this crisis."
In Pictou County, a rural region on Nova Scotia's North Shore, there hasn't been a confirmed infection since mid-August.
But people here have still supported sometimes-painful measures to keep COVID-19 out. Organizers of the beloved Lobster Carnival, a sprawling outdoor party that draws thousands to town, cancelled the event for the first time since the Second World War.
Ms. Stewart's restaurant also lost seating for about 30 people, to abide by distancing rules. Her business is down, and she took a hit with fewer visitors this summer.
But as she watches outbreaks spread in Ontario, Quebec and elsewhere, she's anxious to keep tourists at a distance, and maintain travel restrictions and border checkpoints to protect the "Atlantic bubble" of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island and Newfoundland and Labrador.
"To be honest, I'm petrified," Ms. Stewart said.
"Every case we're getting is travel-related. Let's just leave the border the way it is for the winter. Let's leave them there."
GEOGRAPHIC ADVANTAGE With 2.4 million people, Atlantic Canada benefits from smaller, less dense urban centres and travel patterns that make it easier to control the spread of the coronavirus. People here use less public transit, and the region has fewer points of entry than Saskatchewan or Manitoba, which have higher rates of infection with a similar combined population.
But the Atlantic "miracle" can't be explained away by just by looking at population.
"They certainly have a geographic advantage, and a smaller population that works in its favour. But we still can't ignore smart policy and good leadership there.
That's been a fundamental factor," said Isaac Bogoch, an infectious-disease specialist with the University of Toronto.
"It's really an underdiscussed success story."
The most effective policy, he said, is the requirement that people coming from outside the Atlantic provinces self-isolate for two weeks. It's largely credited with keeping a second wave from appearing east of Quebec.
When six temporary foreign workers tested positive for COVID-19 in New Brunswick in August, they didn't cause an outbreak like those seen in other provinces because they were still in isolation when they were identified. Provincial officials have been able to trace all recent infections to flights from outside the region - proof, they say, that quarantines are working and preventing community spread.
"That's doing the heavy lifting. You're just not introducing or reintroducing infection into your area," Dr. Bogoch said. "I think it may be too soon to celebrate, but not too soon to acknowledge they've been doing a wonderful job to date."
All four provinces monitor out-of-region visitors, using people at call centres and digital daily check-ins during their twoweek quarantine period to make sure they're following the rules. If someone repeatedly doesn't respond to those calls, they can be charged under public-health laws, and fined $1,000 for a first offence.
If you slip up a second time, you could be fined up to $10,000 and face a year in prison. Workers in services deemed essential, such as mining, commercial truckers and the military are exempt from self-isolating, however.
New Brunswick allows those who work in other provinces to come back without self-isolating, while those "rotational workers" do not need to self-isolate in PEI but must be tested on a regular basis. Newfoundland allows rotational workers to end their isolation after one week if they have a negative test. In Nova Scotia, rotational workers still have to self-isolate for 14 days when they come home.
The region's universities have also enforced provincial mobility restrictions for students from outside the region, in at least four cases expelling those who breached their self-isolation in their first 14 days of arrival.
Prince Edward Island has laid more than 50 charges under its Public Health Act in recent months, mostly related to quarantine violations. PEI also tests commercial truckers upon entry at the Confederation Bridge, allowing them to get results within days rather than wait two weeks. The island requires international students and foreign travellers to self-isolate in government-approved quarantine hotels for two weeks, instead of private residences.
Those measures may seem harsh, but they appear to be working. The island, while it had a much-reduced tourism season by relying only on visitors from within the region, has had just 59 cases since the pandemic began.
"I'm certainly concerned about what's happening outside the Atlantic bubble, and it reinforces to me some of the things we've been doing may be helping us," said Heather Morrison, PEI's Chief Health Officer.
"These decisions made a lot of sense, to try to protect the island. But we also know the unintended impacts of COVID have touched many people in a province that relies on tourism." With only three points of entry, PEI's public-health officials have the ability to easily monitor everyone coming into the province, which they do through self-declaration forms. It would be much more difficult to control travel in and out of larger provinces such as Ontario, Dr. Morrison acknowledged.
The four Atlantic provinces were also credited with acting quickly in the early days of the pandemic, shutting down schools days ahead of much of the rest of Canada. They were the only provinces to temporarily close their borders to non-residents, with an exception for essential workers, something that hadn't happened since Confederation.
The provincial borders remained almost fully closed until July, when they formed an Atlantic bubble that allows people from the region to travel freely without self-isolating, while non-residents were allowed in as long as they quarantine.
New Brunswick, where there is currently no one in hospital as a result of COVID-19, turns away several dozen vehicles every day from the Quebec and Maine border checkpoints because they don't have proof of residence or don't have a credible selfisolation plan.
The provinces' response to COVID-19 has evolved over time, as understanding of the pandemic has grown, said Jennifer Russell, New Brunswick's Chief Medical Officer of Health.
Her province's decision to require outsiders' self-isolation came from studying outbreak modelling in other jurisdictions, including Singapore, New York and China's Wuhan province, she said. New Brunswick, with limited numbers of intensive-care beds and ventilators, realized a quarantine policy would be the best way to keep the medical system from being overwhelmed.
"Every province has their own comfort level when it comes to risk tolerance," Dr.
Russell said. "We know what our capacity is, and the goal is to never exceed that. ... If those resources were exhausted, we would quickly be overwhelmed."
Many Atlantic Canadians, who often live in smaller, more rural communities, also tend to be community-minded rule followers who haven't pushed back much against restrictions on travel. There have been none of the mask protests or economic-reopening rallies that have popped up elsewhere.
They're also seeing the benefits of following the rules, as infections drop and restrictions are loosened.
"We have a population that's been very adherent to public-health measures, and I think that's helped a lot," Dr. Morrison in PEI said.
"People want to protect their families, and their broader communities. And they can see we've made great steps in reopening because we don't have the cases that other places have seen." Newfoundland and Nova Scotia both require masks to be worn in public spaces.
PEI and New Brunswick don't have mandatory mask orders, although New Brunswick's largest city, Moncton, now requires them inside city buildings. Most people, however, are wearing them anyway on the advice of public-health officials.
In Nova Scotia, when Premier Stephen McNeil urged people to "stay the blazes home," his province embraced the slogan, making physical distancing into an act of community spirit. People put the slogan on T-shirts and turned it into songs, and weren't afraid to call out those who ignored its message.
"People here are a pretty deferential lot," said Tom Bateman, a professor of political science at St. Thomas University in Fredericton.
"That may be changing, but Maritimers in general have more trust in their governments. And when they're asked to follow public-health rules, they usually listen.
Here it's worked like a charm."
ECONOMIC IMPACT In Sydney, N.S., there are signs everywhere that the city is rebounding from the pandemic. The local casino is reopening, churches are filling up again, and crowds of up to 800 people will soon be allowed into the Centre 200 to watch the local junior hockey team, the Cape Breton Eagles, play.
Teams in the same league from Quebec, meanwhile, will play in empty rinks.
But one of the more surprising indicators of an economic rebound may be in housing sales - including from buyers based outside Atlantic Canada. Many of them are ex-Maritimers returning home, leaving larger urban centres because of COVID-19, drawn back to the relative safety and affordability of the Atlantic region.
"This whole pandemic has made people have another look at where they're living, and asking whether they want to be some place safer," said Ryan O'Donnell, Cape Breton regional director with the Nova Scotia Association of Realtors. "If a good home comes up around here, if you're not writing an offer within a day or two, you'll lose it."
Because of travel restrictions, some outof-province buyers are making offers on homes based on virtual tours alone, and jumping into bidding wars, he said. That's a new phenomenon in the normally slowpaced Cape Breton real estate market, where the average price of a home is $148,000. "I've never seen a market like this," Mr. O'Donnell said. "As realtors, it takes some adjusting to, because this wasn't something we had dealt with before."
Realtors in cities around the region are relaying similar stories. In New Brunswick, home sales were up 25 per cent in June from the previous year, according to the Canadian Real Estate Association. In Fredericton, the province's leafy capital, sales were up more than 50 per cent from the year before, although numbers on out-of-region buyers weren't available.
Moving companies in Newfoundland, meanwhile, say they've been overwhelmed by calls from people relocating back to the province after years away in Alberta or Ontario. The question remains whether it's a just "COVID blip," or a permanent reversal of the province's historic out-migration patterns.
There have been obvious economic hardships from the protective measures brought in to slow the coronavirus, too, particularly in the tourism and hospitality sectors that rely on visitors from outside the region.
In Halifax, hotels are operating at about 10-per-cent capacity, and some restaurants aren't expected to reopen. With infection rates remaining so low, calls are growing to ease more restrictions to help those businesses survive. "We're in a pretty special place in North America," said Patrick Sullivan, president and chief executive officer of the Halifax Chamber of Commerce. "So if we're living in a bit of a walled garden right now, can we not enjoy some of the benefits? We've put in a lot of hurdles to limit the spread of COVID in Atlantic Canada, and yet our restaurants are still facing many of the same requirements that restaurants elsewhere are facing."
He'd like to see faster testing at Nova Scotia's borders, so that out-of-region visitors can return, and easing limits on indoor gathering for restaurants so they can serve more customers. Office towers in Halifax still allow only two people in an elevator at a time, which Mr. Sullivan says feels like overkill when masks are mandatory and cases of the disease remain so low.
While Atlantic Canadians did what they could to support local businesses this summer, those "bubble vacations" typically benefited rural businesses instead of urban ones, as people took the opportunity to get out of cities, he said.
At the Cabot Cape Breton golf resort in Nova Scotia, where in a normal year 80 per cent of visitors come from outside Atlantic Canada, it's been a challenging time. The luxury golf destination, which often caters to international guests who fly in to the Sydney airport on private jets, had to trim its work force, reduce fees and pivot to attract locals this summer.
That's meant empty fairways some days, quiet patios and hotel rooms going unused.
As the pandemic rages in other parts of the country, staff here are just trying to remain optimistic the crowds will come back in 2021.
"Once everybody realized the severity of this thing, cancellations started pouring in," said Andrew Alkenbrack, the resort's general manager. "We just have to see how this thing plays out."

Full text: Amazon.com Inc. says it will hire 3,500 new corporate and tech-focused employees across Canada in the coming years, including 3,000 in downtown Vancouver, which would bring its total employment there to 8,000 by 2024.
The e-commerce and cloud services giant had previously said it wanted to bring its office-based work force to 5,000 people in British Columbia's biggest city, just north of its headquarters in Seattle. But the plans are expanding as Amazon prepares to become the sole corporate tenant in the combined 35 floors of two towers on the site of Vancouver's former central Canada Post office.
The company is taking the space in part because it sees in-person interactions as critical, even as other large companies become more flexible in work-from-home arrangements and, in some cases, sublease their spaces. In deepening its presence in Vancouver, Amazon will also likely further squeeze the Lower Mainland's tightening market for top tech talent.
Amazon also said it would add 500 people to the 1,600 corporate employees it has in Toronto. The newly announced jobs in both cities will be in divisions such as cloud services, Alexa voice assistance, advertising, retail and operations technology.
The Globe and Mail reported last November that Amazon had agreed to lease 1.1 million square feet in The Post development, which comprises an entire city block, making room for thousands of new corporate employees in Vancouver on top of the 2,700 it currently employs in the city, including in Telus Garden, at 475 Howe St.
and soon at 402 Dunsmuir St.
Although the pandemic has prompted many companies to implement work-from-home policies - including Shopify Inc., which announced 1,000 jobs in Vancouver last January before becoming permanently "remote by default" - Amazon says it wants to tap into Canadian talent while giving employees the ability to work from an office when the pandemic subsides.
"What we've heard is that [employees] really value being able to be together, and interact in real time to solve interesting customer problems, but they also value the flexibility created by work from home," said Jesse Dougherty, an Amazon vice-president and its Vancouver site lead, in an interview. "We look at finding solutions that provide both of those values," he said, adding, "We like to be in the community we work in, and creating a central location helps us do that."
The new Toronto employees will be based on five floors of a new office tower at 18 York St. - adding to Amazon's downtown space that includes five floors in Scotia Plaza and at 120 Bremner Blvd. Both 18 York St. and The Post are owned by Vancouver's QuadReal Property Group Ltd.
By playing host to teams from numerous corporate divisions in the rapidly expanding Vancouver office, Mr. Dougherty said, Amazon hopes employees will feel comfortable shifting between divisions and projects to remain engaged and happy. Doing so would also relieve pressure among employees to either move to a U.S.
office or leave the company altogether.
In both Vancouver and Toronto, Amazon says it will hire software engineers, user experience designers, speech scientists for Alexa, cloud-computing architects and sales and marketing executives.
Amazon, whose market capitalization is more than US$1.5trillion, says it has invested US$11billion in Canada since 2010 - as it has both hired Canadian talent and expanded its warehouse and cloud-computing networks in the country. Including its warehouse fulfillment employees, Mr. Dougherty said the company directly employs more than 21,000 full- and part-time workers in Canada.
Local tech-sector experts said last November that the massive hiring spree is expected to trigger a talent war, boost wages and drive immigration to the Lower Mainland while putting further pressure on one of Canada's hottest housing markets.
The massive Vancouver headcount will prompt Amazon to compete for workers with branch offices from other U.S. powerhouses such as Microsoft Corp.
and Facebook Inc., and is expected to only increase the war for talent between the U.S. juggernauts and the city's growing startup scene.
Real estate service CBRE reported last year that Vancouver has nearly 75,000 tech jobs at an average annual wage of about $84,000. The average Amazon software engineer in Canada makes closer to $99,000, according to the compensation research service PayScale.
In 2018, KPMG issued a report that found that the growth of B.C.'s tech scene was "outpacing the rate at which provincial schools and training organizations can provide new blood."
The hiring spree could have trickle-down effects into the city's startup scene as well. Vancouver was Canada's third-biggest destination for venture capital investment in 2019 with $1.05-billion invested, according to the Canadian Venture Capital & Private Equity Association - behind Montreal and Toronto. It was also home to one of the country's biggest venture deals that year - a $333.5-million growth-financing round in the legal software company Themis Solutions Inc., which operates as Clio.
Mr. Dougherty, who was born on the Sunshine Coast in B.C., said Amazon recognized that Big Tech employees often take their experience and launch startups of their own - which he said could benefit the local startup ecosystem as well.
Amazon has been on a massive hiring spree since the COVID-19 pandemic prompted a surge in ecommerce, and said two weeks ago that it soon hoped to hire 100,000 new workers in Canada and in the United States.
In recent years, Amazon has faced allegations from employees of difficult working conditions.
The New York Times has described its workplace culture as "bruising," while The Guardian has described "gruelling" warehouse conditions. Reuters has reported that the government of California is investigating Amazon's treatment of workers during the pandemic. The company says it works to keep its employees as safe as possible, has made more than 100 process changes because of COVID-19 and operates like a startup, where a focus on innovation often comes with high pressure.)
Earlier in September, Amazon also announced two new warehouses to fulfil orders in Hamilton and Ajax, Ont., promising to hire 2,500 workers there. The two new warehouses would bring the company's total in Canada to 16.

Full text: 5 Honey Locust Ct., Vaughan, Ont.
WOODLAND ACRES Asking price: $6,880,000 Selling price: $6-million Taxes: $6,000 (2019) Days on the market: 139 Listing agent: Voula Argyropoulos and Jerry Hammond, Hammond International Properties Ltd.
THE ACTION Even in the best of times it can take up to a year to sell a house in this upscale neighbourhood in York Region.
This newly built house had the misfortune to list in early March just as the coronavirus pandemic was gearing up. But local shoppers began to trickle in over the summer.
"Before the spring market, things were looking good and picking up since the fall of 2017, so we thought it was perfect timing," agent Voula Argyropoulos said. "And shortly after we listed, COVID hit, so that put a damper on our marketing and interest in showings.
"Woodland Acres is a community of properties that sit on at least 1, 11/2 to 2 acres. There was quite a bit of inventory at the time, but this particular property was the only new-build."
WHAT THEY GOT The house sits on a 231-foot-by-228-foot lot at the end of a cul-de-sac. It has 8,650 square feet of living space.
The living and dining rooms are separated by a grand foyer.
Stretched across the rear is a large family room with 25-foot ceiling and a full-height fireplace. The kitchen has been outfitted by Irpinia Kitchens with two islands and a butler's pantry.
There are multiple doors to a covered veranda with an outdoor fireplace.
The master bedroom, the largest of five in the house, has a separate dressing room and bathroom - one of eight in the house.
Outside is a porte-cochère and triple attached garage. The basement is unfinished.
THE AGENT'S TAKE "It was finished in late 2018, so it was the largest, most expensive and newest home," Ms. Argyropoulos said.
"The ceiling heights, transitional style, the flooring used, and the kitchen were the key elements in getting this house sold to those particular buyers."

Full text: Brookfield Property Partners plans to whittle down its portfolio of U.S. malls in addition to reducing staff by 20 per cent at its U.S. retail division after the coronavirus pandemic upended shopping centres.
The global real estate owner said it was forced to accelerate plans to overhaul its suite of more than 170 U.S. malls after local government restrictions temporarily closed indoor spaces, which contributed to Brookfield's huge second-quarter loss.
Mall landlords have had to deal with growing vacancies as retailers big and small file for creditor protection or shut their stores.
But chief executive officer Brian Kingston told investors that the company would not be rushing sales.
"The number of malls we will have at some point in the future will be fewer than the number of malls we have today," he said at its parent company's investor day, which was broadcast online. "That does not mean we are running out there trying to sell malls in a market like we see today," he said.
Mr. Kingston's comments come after Brookfield told its employees on Monday that one-fifth of its approximately 2,000 retail employees in the U.S. would be laid off. The company, which has US$203-billion in assets under management, owns real estate around the world, including 253 office buildings, 180 apartments, student housing, storage warehouses and hotels.
Brookfield became the second-largest shopping centre operator in the U.S. when it acquired GGP's 125 malls a few years ago.
Mr. Kingston said there is too much retail space in the U.S. But he said if retailers were reducing the number and size of their stores, they would likely choose to stay in or relocate to a Brookfield mall, many of which are in densely populated areas.
Brookfield and the largest U.S. mall operator, Simon Property Group, have proposed buying department store chain J.C. Penney Co. for US$1.75-billion.
The retailer is currently restructuring under creditor protection.
The deal would be financed from Toronto-based parent company Brookfield Asset Management Inc.'s US$5-billion fund to prop up retailers by providing capital in exchange for non-controlling stakes in the business.
At the investor event, Mr. Kingston said the purpose of the fund was to draw on the company's knowledge of retail to invest in brands that will succeed in the future. He said "historically, the department stores have not really fit into that category," but called J.C.
Penney an opportunity given the size and scale of the chain's business. Mr. Kingston said Brookfield would invest to expand the department store's online and distribution capabilities.
Brookfield is not the only mall owner struggling during the pandemic. Canadian real estate companies Cadillac Fairview, Ivanhoé Cambridge and Oxford Properties have had to provide rent deferrals for their hardest-hit tenants during the pandemic. Ivanhoé, a global real estate player owned by Quebec's pension fund, Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, has been trying to sell some of its 25 Canadian malls.
Brookfield Property has lost 40 per cent of its value on the stock exchange since the beginning of the year and has had to buy back units to help prop up the price.
Brookfield Asset Management said that as of June 30, Brookfield Property represented US$14.4-billion of its US$45.3-billion invested capital.

Full text: TORONTO Stand at any corner at the windswept intersection of Kennedy Road and Eglinton Avenue East and look across to any other, and it's like déjà vu all over again. Nothing rises over five storeys - save for one 1990s tower in the distance - and strip plazas and gas stations dominate the flat landscape.
Yet, in the middle of Eglinton, work progresses in what was, formerly, six lanes of blacktop as the 19-kilometre Crosstown light-rail line prepares to open in 2022.
Standing 500 metres away on a triangular, city-owned piece of land a stone's throw from the TTC's Kennedy station and the Kennedy GO commuter station, Rich Analytics chief technology officer Mark Richardson marvels at the massive parking lot at our feet and the empty air above our heads: "So you've probably got about $15billion worth of transit infrastructure that intersects at this corner - and there's nothing here."
"This is actually the only intersection in the city that has a GO, a TTC and an LRT," says architect Naama Blonder of Smart Density.
Ms. Blonder, Mr. Richardson and the four others assembled here - Andrea Adams of affordable housing builder St. Clare's; Diane Dyson of community builder The Neighbourhood Group; urban planner Alexei Guerra of Sweeny&Co.; and Smart Density's Joshua Papernick - aren't here to throw shade. Rather, they're here to discuss their advocacy and pro bono work that ensures that, when the City of Toronto does build affordable housing on this site through its "Housing Now" initiative, the maximum number of units get built.
They have reason to be wary. In January, 2019, Phase One of Housing Now presented 11 sites to the public. Of the four "fast track" build-outs, Mr. Richardson says, "two of them were really successful, one was not really successful and the other one was a total disaster" insofar, as the Warden Ave/St.
Clair Ave. E. site is three times the size of Kennedy/Eglinton, yet only 600 units will be built there. Many of the sites haven't gone through the approvals process yet.
"From a site plan perspective, they don't utilize the land," Ms. Blonder says. "I'm not even talking about height."
Again, these HousingNowTO volunteers are not throwing shade at the City of Toronto's efforts; there is a very real affordable housing crisis and the city is finally working hard to address it. It's just that after seeing how the first 11 didn't squeeze enough proverbial juice out of the lemon, they decided to react with greater speed when Round 2's six sites were announced in May, 2020 (most on parking lots by transit, which Mr. Richardson calls "lazy land").
Within three weeks, HousingNowTO had produced detailed site plans, renderings, shadow studies and all sorts of other hard data to "anchor our numbers" to each site "before the city got a plan out the door," Mr. Richardson says.
Was this to shame them, this writer asks? "No," Mr. Richardson says. "It's to show the opportunities that are there if you're not tied down by local political considerations."
"I think that [the city] is actually pretty grateful that we exist," Ms. Blonder adds.
"We ended up doubling the number of units they targeted."
For instance, on this lot beside Kennedy station (which also sports an abandoned, one-storey auto repair shop), Smart Density illustrates in an eight-page report that three towers - one at 36 storeys, another at 20 and a third at 19 - would provide more than 800 units, a community centre, school and daycare facility. The towers, it should be noted, would respect all legal setbacks from the railway corridor to the east and the hydro corridor to the north, and the distance between the towers and their angular planes (to transition to the lowrise neighbourhood beyond the hydro corridor) would adhere to city guidelines.
Most importantly, however, there would be more than enough market-rate ownership units and market-rate rental units to enable the city to provide one-third as affordable rentals.
"We need to make these buildings big enough to make the affordable component, the green component, all the math work," Mr. Richardson says, "and it only works if you're going to step over what the planning guide from 20 years ago said for this district."
And that's the rub: Parking for hundreds of cars just won't cut it in the 21st century, even in car-centric Scarborough. As Ms. Blonder points out, she jumped on a GO train at Union Station and stepped off at this site in less than 20 minutes ... that's not the Scarborough our grandparents knew.
And remember, Toronto expects to welcome hundreds of thousands of new residents in the next few decades. Where will we put them?
Yes, some will protest the loss of parking (it happened at a Housing Now site at Wilson subway station) and residents of single-family homes will worry that shadows will fall on their patios (Ms. Blonder assures me that at Kennedy, the hydro corridor buffer will prevent that). But since these six sites are going to be developed no matter what, what's better? The city's estimated 1,400 to 1,700 units, which would provide 530 to 620 affordable-rent units. Or HousingNowTO's estimate of 2,600 - 2,700, which would generate 900 affordable units?
"This is tabula rasa," Mr. Richardsonsays.
"You could have shovels in the ground here really quickly, [in] these big suburban parking lots near transit.
"People might not always like our advice, but no one has said our math is wrong."
The City of Toronto has targeted 40,000 new affordable housing units by 2030. To learn more about Housing Now, visit bit.ly/2FJ1JZw or createto.ca/housingnow/. To follow the efforts of the advocacy group HousingNowTO, visit their Twitter feed.

Toronto-area market remains competitive: NEXT MOVE

Full text: In Toronto and the surrounding Greater Golden Horseshoe, house hunters are entering bidding contests with resolve.
Many pockets of Toronto are still "insanely competitive right now," says John Pasalis, president of Realosophy Realty Inc.
"It's like an extension of the summer," Mr. Pasalis says. "I think most people have been shocked by how busy and competitive the market is."
Mr. Pasalis says government support has helped to buoy the economy, which in turn has kept the housing market lively.
A slight lull leading up to Labour Day has given way to people renewing their efforts to move in September, he says.
Still, the frenzy of July has calmed somewhat.
In the popular Leslieville neighbourhood where Realosophy is based, homeowners might receive between two and four offers instead of the 10 they were tallying at the height of the summer.
"It's not quite as crazy as it was two months ago."
Still, Mr. Pasalis has been surprised by the recent strength. After sales plummeted in March and April, he expected the market to remain flat for a time.
Many trends were hard to predict, he says, including the urge many people had to move out of condo towers and into a home with a backyard.
"It's hard to predict the behavioural changes as the result of a pandemic."
Mr. Pasalis is hearing from people who are leaving the city in the search for more space in the suburbs or Ontario small towns.
"We're still getting calls from people who are contemplating a move out of the city."
Some businesses in the downtown core have seen employees gamble on being able to continue working from home indefinitely.
"Their staff have been moving out with the expectation that they could permanently work from home."
For some people, a suburban home with a swimming pool has suddenly become attractive. People who weren't even contemplating a move in February changed their minds quickly when lockdown came into effect.
People aren't able to travel, so they're willing to spend money on fun and recreation at home.
"As you start moving out of the downtown core, the idea of having a pool-sized backyard has become a bigger priority than it
was a year ago. If you talk to pool people, they're booming."
In Mississauga, Janice Goss, broker with Re/Max Professionals Inc., recently had 10 bidders vying for a house with a pool and a fish pond in the backyard. The four-bedroom house at 1590 Tipperary Ct. sold for $1.53-million one day after being listed with an asking price of $1.29-million.
Ms. Goss says the pool may have drawn some prospective buyers, but the property is also on a dead-end street in a popular subdivision with many more expensive homes nearby.
"It's a good price point for that neighbourhood," she says. "It's a good entry level."
Parks, schools and the downtown Port Credit area are all nearby.
Still, Ms. Goss did not set a date for reviewing offers because she did not think the property would attract as much action as it did.
"The first offer came the first day," she says, and it was good for 24 hours. "In that time, another nine came in."
Ms. Goss says that the market at $1.5-million and below is very active in Mississauga, but it cools above that level.
"Some in that same sub-division are at $1.7-million and they haven't sold."
At the $3-million mark and above, some sellers are reducing asking prices or taking offers at substantial discounts.
In West Hamilton, real estate agent Angela Hogben of Re/Max Escarpment Realty Inc. recently sold a four-level backsplit for $760,000 after listing the property with an asking price of $749,900.
Ms. Hogben set an offer date the following week. The first day, a couple came in with a bully offer and the owners accepted.
Ms. Hogben says the threebedroom house at 623 Cherrygrove Cres. is not large, but it is nicely renovated and has a pleasant backyard.
The buyers are local, she adds.
Despite all the tales of people migrating out of Toronto, she finds many clients these days are swapping properties closer to home.
"People who live in Hamilton would also like a big yard. People have been cooped up in the house for so long," she says, and the common sentiment is, "we want out and we want out yesterday."
Ms. Hogben recently helped buyers purchase a small, entrylevel house in Brantford, Ont. for $400,000.
Ms. Hogben says the owners set an asking price of $399,900 and an offer date, but no bidders came to the table.
"When people hold back offers, it can blow up. You always run that risk," she says. "A lot of people are turned off by that."
The listing agent pressed the buyers to go to $420,000, but Ms. Hogben held firm.
"We're still literally the only offer available," was her reply.
Ms. Hogben is also seeing an upswing in buyers seeking country properties amid the wineries and farms of Lincoln and Pelham, Ont.
"I'm going to buy a cornfield and build a house," is a common refrain, she says.
But Ms. Hogben points out that the rules surrounding construction loans are different than conventional mortgage.
In Toronto, Mr. Pasalis says that the cohort heading away from the big city is only a small slice of the market. Many more transactions in the Toronto market stem from residents moving within the city. For many people, trading up means moving to a semi-detached house with a small amount of outdoor space for the children.
"A yard is a yard," he says. "A massive yard and a detached house are not a priority for everybody."
Looking ahead, many market watchers are keeping an eye on the so-called deferral cliff this fall. When financial institutions phase out their programs that allowed homeowners to defer mortgage payments, some forecasters cautioned that those owners would not be able to get back on track.
Mr. Pasalis doesn't believe significant numbers of homeowners will bail. One harbinger that mortgage brokers are watching is the activity at private lenders.
Typically people who have trouble paying their debts will refinance at a higher interest rate at a second-tier lender.
"That's what you do first before you hand over your keys," he says.
So far, activity at private lenders is very quiet, according to Mr. Pasalis's contacts in the industry.

Industry veterans call for calm as Ottawa offices sit empty

Full text: Ottawa's top employer is showing no signs of encouraging its staff to return to their offices, but commercial real estate industry veterans say now is not the time to panic about a mass exodus from the city's downtown core.
The federal government employs more than 120,000 people in the Ottawa region, according to the Treasury Board of Canada, and Ottawa-Gatineau's total office inventory is pegged at approximately 41 million square feet, according to CBRE Group Inc., with the federal government occupying 40 per cent of the office space in the city and owning 68 office buildings.
So, what's a city to do when its largest commercial real estate tenant may keep its office workers at home for the long term?
Despite "sleeping with an elephant," Martin Aass, broker of Ottawa-based record and managing principal of Cresa, says of the federal government's massive impact on employment and office space, things aren't as bad as they may seem at first blush - even with the city's corporate crown jewel, Shopify, putting 170,000 square feet of space on the sublease market in early September.
If the federal government continues to encourage work-fromhome for just 20 per cent of its work force, 10 per cent of the whole of Ottawa's downtown would be vacant, Mr. Aass says, adding that the federal government tends to move slowly.
"We haven't heard about departments downsizing or changing their footprints," he says.
"That's not immediately in the cards."
Mr. Aass says in speaking to Ottawa landlords they are starting to hear discussions around government entities surrendering space. That was to be expected, he explains, given how much money has been injected into various parts of the Canadian economy through COVID-19 relief programs. "They want to save money," he says.
Alain Belle-Isle, a spokesperson for the Treasury Board of Canada (the government's employer), said in an e-mail to The Globe and Mail that the government is reviewing its "human resources policies and practices."
He said employees of every organization under the federal umbrella who need or want to come back to work are given reasonable notice before returning. It doesn't, however, seem like Ottawa's biggest group of office dwellers will be doing that anytime soon.
"As public-health authorities have signalled that physical-distancing requirements will remain in place, many employees will continue to work remotely for some time to come," he said.
Ashley Hopkins, chief executive of Paradigm Properties - a commercial property management firm in Ottawa with government clients - says during the onset of what was dubbed "Workplace 2.0," in the early 2010s, there was concern that Ottawa's downtown office space would become a wasteland after the government shrunk its footprint by 25 per cent.
That doomsday never came, however, and recent conversations with those in the federal work force are pointing to a hybrid model of work from both the office and home, she says.
"People can't work from home forever," Ms. Hopkins says. "The doom and gloom [about] all the businesses going bankrupt because no one would be working from the office shouldn't be as heavy."
While Ottawa has experienced some softness in its commercial real estate market in the past, urban technology companies such as Shopify, SurveyMonkey and Telesat flourished in the government's place - like when it downsized in the mid-2000s - according to one Ottawa commercial real estate expert.
Technology is now the secondlargest user class in the city's downtown core.
"Ottawa has been isolated by ups and downs in the market because we've always been a government town," says Shawn Hamilton, senior vice-president of CBRE Ottawa Inc. "[Shopify] putting space on the sublease market is our first foray into acting like we have a private, sector-driven downtown core. We're going to be sensitive to the ups and downs that come with that until we get used to it."
Courtney Schaefer, a researcher with CBRE in Ottawa, says an increased presence of urban tech in the city's core means swings in vacancy rates will also increase, as the tech industry responds more rapidly to economic change than does the government.
That's not a bad thing, she points out, for a city that is becoming a major tech hub in North America.
"It is inevitable that vacancy rates increase during uncertain times," Ms. Schaefer says. "It happened in the early 1990s, 2000 and 2008 and [now] we're seeing signs of rising vacancy rates in response to the COVID-19 pandemic - primarily due to Shopify placing space on the market for sublease."
Ms. Schaefer adds: "Our view is that this phenomenon is cyclical; and with all cycles, there will eventually be a period of recovery."
Some real estate pundits feel Shopify putting its whole Elgin Street office on the sublease market is sparking some of the local concern Ms. Hopkins alluded to.
But that shouldn't be the case, says Rai Sahi, CEO of Morguard Corp., and the landlord of Performance Court at 150 Elgin St.
Shopify is keeping its other office in the city's downtown core, and Mr. Sahi says Morguard and Shopify have not had any serious discussions about the space at this point.
"We're not concerned about it.
Morguard is the largest landlord in Ottawa, as well as the largest landlord of the provincial and federal governments," Mr. Sahi said. "Each office is just four walls."
Mr. Sahi says it wouldn't be difficult to rework the footprint of Shopify's space for other tenants. Since it's on the sublease market, Shopify will have to bear some of the responsibility of finding a new tenant for its space.
"Either we'll work out a deal with them or we will lease it," he says.
Even with the nearly 200,000square-foot Shopify space now on the market, the total sublease market in Ottawa is below the 17year average of 600,000 square feet.
It's a far cry from 2003, according to CBRE data, which showed 2.1 million square feet available.
In 2008, there were one million square feet available.
While some Ottawa experts feel the federal government could occupy Shopify's space - given its idyllic downtown location, Mr. Hamilton says it's more likely a group of startups, or a U.S. company keen to take advantage of Canada's welcoming immigration policies and Ottawa's sizeable tech talent pool, could slide in.
Despite the federal government's hesitation to bring its massive Ottawa-based work force back to the office, "for every business that is heading out the door," Ms. Hopkins says, "there seems to be another one behind it."

Full text: Vancouver Mayor Kennedy Stewart is launching a bold push to create cheaper forms of housing in Vancouver's singlefamily neighbourhoods by calling for the city to allow up to six units on any residential lot.
The catch is that two would have to be rented or sold at below-market rates permanently.
That could be a first for Canada and is only outdone by Portland, Ore., which recently passed a similar policy in midAugust except that it required three "affordable" units if there were six built on a lot. Fourplexes would be allowed outright under Vancouver's new proposal.
Most other U.S. cities looking at housing reform in singlefamily neighbourhoods have not proposed anything beyond allowing triplexes.
Mr. Stewart said the new approach is desperately needed because it would provide affordable options "in the 60 per cent of the city that is simply out of reach to average families, couples and those looking to downsize their homes."
A single detached three-bedroom house in Vancouver was selling for $2-million in August, while a three-bedroom townhouse was $1.4-million, according to statistics from real estate site and lister zolo.ca.
The mayor's idea, if endorsed by council, could see as much as 50 per cent more buildable floor space allowed than even the most generous current zoning provision in single-family areas. That would mean allowing as much as 4,800 square feet of housing on a regular Vancouver lot, instead of the current 2,800 square feet that is standard or the 3,260 sq. ft. allowed on lots where there is a laneway house linked to a pre-1940 house.
Any extra density would only be granted if one or two below-market homes were included, to be registered with the city and kept below-market permanently.
The mayor said surveys have shown that more than 70 per cent of residents want to see new housing options. Local homeowner representatives did not have a response to the mayor's idea immediately, saying they needed more time to look at it.
One urban design professor who is vocal about city planning said Mr. Kennedy's proposal is a good model, but has one major flaw.
"I think requiring any less than three [affordable] units of the six is a missed opportunity and will lead to inflated land prices," University of British Columbia professor Patrick Condon said.
The local group that supports more housing options, Abundant Housing Vancouver, is solidly behind the idea.
"About 55 per cent of new floor space built in Vancouver is detached houses that just replace old detached houses with no increase in homes. This is a good first step toward addressing that wasted opportunity while providing some enhanced affordability," said AHV's Owen Brady.
Mr. Stewart's proposal - which his team crafted in consultation with a group that included small-home builders, an architect and a planner - will be included in Wednesday's council meeting as an amendment to a housing motion already on the schedule from Councillor Lisa Dominato.
The plan is for staff to come back with guidelines in the middle of next year, then begin with 100 applications in a pilot program.
The program wouldn't be open to owners of homes with renters or homes on the heritage register.
It is likely to become a campaign issue in the 2022 civic election, given the frequent divisiveness in the city over allowing denser housing in existing neighbourhoods.
City staff had been working on a new policy to allow housing options with more density - everything from duplexes to small apartment buildings - in small transition zones next to major streets, but that work has been moving slowly.
With his amendment aimed at more aggressive action, Mr. Stewart said he hopes the new initiative will be a compromise that a majority of councillors and residents can get behind.
The Vancouver builder who came up with the original version of the idea a couple of years ago, Jake Fry, said he believes his solution is a way out of some of the current impasses over how to add new homes to the city.
"I think this is really the only progress we've seen that addresses homeowner affordability without changing the fabric of the neighbourhood. This is something we can do and have low visual impact," Mr. Fry said.
He championed the hugely popular laneway houses more than a decade ago and his company, Smallworks, has built hundreds of them since they were first allowed in 2009.

Full text: On the 14th floor of a tower filled with cramped workspaces in China's high-tech city, a small military contractor is building tools to track politicians, aerospace entrepreneurs, scholars and other influential people around the world, including thousands in Canada.
The office of Shenzhen Zhenhua Data Information Technology Co. Ltd. is modest. When a Globe and Mail reporter visited, three people sat at desks in what appeared to be a converted studio apartment, with the bathroom door open. One person was entering code into a computer, while another worked on a PowerPoint presentation. The third person said the company has a work force of more than 30 employees. And although she said Zhenhua is expanding, that's small even by China's startup standards.
Its ambitions, though, extend far beyond its small real estate footprint. It is building tools to process the world's opensource information about influential people - culled from Twitter, criminal records, LinkedIn posts, YouTube videos and more - into data that can be analyzed and used by universities, companies, government actors and the Chinese military. "Our client base is a bit special," the woman said.
The Globe and a consortium of international journalists have accessed an early copy of the company's Overseas Key Information Database (OKIDB), which shows the type of information Zhenhua is collecting for use in China.
The information includes records on small-town mayors in Western Canada, where Chinese diplomats have sought to curry favour.
The company claims to have built tools to manipulate content on Twitter, WhatsApp and other platforms, including Facebook - which says it has banned Zhenhua from gathering data on its platform.
The company declined an interview request, saying it was not "convenient" to disclose trade secrets. Its website became inaccessible after The Globe visited its office, which is located in a government-backed business incubator building across the street from an investigative centre for the local Public Security Bureau - all a short drive from the headquarters of some of China's most important technology companies and civilian military contractors, including Tencent and China Electronics Corp.
The company, led by a former IBM data centre management expert, has also described its work online in job postings, LinkedIn records, blog articles and software patents. One employee described work "mining the business needs of military customers for overseas data." Before it became inaccessible, Zhenhua's website listed a series of partners that included important military contractors.
It claims to have collected information on more than 2.4 million people and 650,000 organizations from about two billion social-media articles.
Together the documents reveal a Chinese firm with a keen interest in advanced forms of warfare, the structure of the U.S. intelligence apparatus and the use of social media to achieve military victories.
The company has secured a software patent for a "social media account simulation system," a title that connotes a tool for managing networks of fake social-media usernames in ways that emulate human characteristics, making them more effective at spreading messages.
Zhenhua's name translates to "China Revival," a reference to a mantra of President Xi Jinping, who has proclaimed the "great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation."
"It seems to be collecting information about people who are around things that China would be interested in. The question is whether this is a database of potential targets that could be used by the intelligence services of China to get what they want," said Stephanie Carvin, a former national security analyst who is now an associate professor of international relations at Carleton University.
Prof. Carvin looked at the database on behalf of The Globe and said it wasn't clear whether it was being used by Chinese intelligence or had simply been created by a company hoping to sell it to Chinese intelligence.
But she found it curious that it contained records on people such as Ella-Grace Trudeau, the 11-yearold daughter of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, and Jeremy Fry, the adult son of long-time MP Hedy Fry. That, Prof. Carvin said, suggested an attempt to learn more not just about the people in power in Canada but about those around them.
"Why have these people in some kind of database? That, to me, is the question that national security agencies in the West have to figure out. That's the thing I worry about," Prof. Carvin said.
"Is this an attempt to create a database of targetable individuals?
And what are they trying to do with that?" A version of the Zhenhua OKIDB database analyzed by The Globe contained almost 16,000 entries mentioning Canada.
Its files seem to have been cobbled together from various sources. Some catalogue news stories, including hundreds of Globe articles, while others are archived Facebook posts from U.S. President Donald Trump about trade tariffs. A large portion of the data appears to have been extracted from the business information website Crunchbase and serves as a Rolodex of social-media accounts and contact information for people in all sorts of occupations, from tech executives to university professors. Roughly 70 per cent of the people captured in the data are men.
The database appears to have a special focus on mayors of Western Canadian towns, as well as academics and bureaucrats who focus on international relations.
However, the effort is broader than it is deep.
Jeremy Kirk, an information security analyst who said he gained independent access to the database earlier this year, said he didn't see any sign that it was a tool of an intelligence service.
"This is data that anyone could find through a Google search. So far, none of the data has been linked to a non-public data source. As it stands, it doesn't represent a threat to any country," said Mr. Kirk, who is the executive editor of the Australia-based Information Security Media Group. "But people should be mindful of what they post publicly on the internet, as it could be collected by other countries for commercial gain or intelligence purposes."
The vast majority of the files contain little more than what can be found about the individuals on social-media websites such as Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn. If the person of interest has a police record, links are included to newspaper stories about their cases.
The mass scraping of data contravenes Facebook's policies, spokeswoman Liz Bourgeois said.
"We have banned Shenzhen Zhenhua Data Technology from our platform and sent a cease and desist letter ordering them to stop," she said. LinkedIn does "not permit the use of any software that scrapes or copies information from LinkedIn," spokesperson Billy Huang said. "If any violation of our user agreement is uncovered or reported, we investigate and take necessary steps to protect our members' information."
The database also contains a shorter list of 3,767 Canadians who have been assigned a grade of 1, 2 or 3. Those assigned a 1 appear to be people of direct influence, such as mayors, MPs or senior civil servants, while those assigned a 2 are often relatives of people in power, such as Mr. Trudeau's daughter and Ms. Fry's son.
Those assigned a grade of 3 often have criminal convictions, mostly for economic crimes.
Dozens of current and former MPs dot the list, including new Conservative Party Leader Erin O'Toole, whose file includes a link to the web page of his official parliamentary profile and, like most, a seven-digit ID number.
Others with files assigned a grade of 1 include senior bureaucrats at the Canadian Nuclear Safety Commission, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, the Treasury Board, the Transportation Safety Board, Export Development Canada - even the Office of the Privacy Commissioner.
The justice system appears to be another focus of the database, which contains entries on judges up to and including current and former members of the Supreme Court of Canada.
Notable individuals assigned a grade of 3 include former theatre impresario Garth Drabinsky, who was convicted of fraud in 2009, former SNC-Lavalin executive Riadh Ben Aissa, who pleaded guilty to corruption charges in Switzerland before testifying against his superiors in Canada, and Nicola Iammarrone, a former Canada Revenue Agency auditor who pleaded guilty to taking bribes.
It is unclear how often the database is updated, as several names on the list appear to correspond with those of prominent Canadians who have died, in some cases many years ago.
Entries about Canadian criminals feature prominently. The database lists 198 people it says are associated with narcotics, 178 with conspiracy, 162 with fraud and 100 with money laundering.
A handful of people are mentioned multiple times, including Gilles Vaillancourt, the former Laval, Que., mayor jailed in 2016 on fraud charges; Amin Mohamed Durrani, jailed after being arrested in the 2006 Toronto anti-terrorism sweep; and Michael Witen, an accountant who was found guilty of defrauding the federal government.
Zhenhua appears to be "a company hoovering up open-source intelligence, and one of the things where there is a lot of open-source intelligence is around criminal records and court records," said Garrett Graff, co-author of Dawn of the Code War: America's Battle Against Russia, China, and the Rising Global Cyber Threat.
According to database timestamps, all of the Canadian entries analyzed by The Globe were collected in mid-to-late 2018.
Data collection on this scale is not without precedent. The internet made collecting massive amounts of general-purpose data infinitely easier, giving rise to "data brokers." Today these companies sell datasets ranging from credit-card purchasing histories to cellphone geolocation data, and their clients rely on the information for everything from tailoring advertising campaigns to calculating credit scores.
But other evidence points to Chinese players attempting to take in large amounts of data. A series of data breaches between 2013 and 2018 attributed to Chinese hackers stole personal information from Marriott hotels, the United States Office of Personnel Management and health insurer Anthem. China routinely denies involvement in hacking.
Each individual collection of data may be of limited value. But "when you begin to layer these databases on top of one another, it provides an arguably unparallelled window into human targeting - backgrounds, personal motivations, personal weaknesses - and provides a roadmap for influencing people," Mr. Graff said.
Zhenhua's data is structured in a way similar to that of Factiva, a research tool from Dow Jones that also catalogues influential people around the world. In fact, the woman at the Zhenhua office likened the company's products to those of Dow Jones and Wind Information, a Chinese provider.
"Some foreign software companies are able to obtain content such as videos, text and music from social media posts. What we can do is to get them all at once," she said. The company describes OKIDB as tracking people, institutions, connections and relationships. The people include "global leaders and core figures in the fields of military, politics, business, science and technology, media, civil organizations" and the like.
Zhenhua's clients are in government, the military, universities and academic institutes, the woman at the company said, adding they can use the company's technology to "conduct a more detailed analysis of a certain professor." She said the company is not merely a technology provider, as its employees actively work with customers and are based in cities across China, including Nanjing and Wuhan.
Western intelligence services now estimate that "China has collected personally identifiable information on 80 per cent of the U.S. population," said Nicholas Eftimiades, a former senior U.S. intelligence officer and China expert who recently published Chinese Espionage: Operations and Tactics. For a company like Zhenhua, applying artificial intelligence tools to a trove of socialmedia data can help its customers attain their "goals locally, regionally, nationally or commercially," he said.
"You're talking about the ability to influence academics, political leaders ranging from mayors up through senior leaders in a government. It's about influencing them to serve the Chinese Communist Party's desires, their goals."
Online, Zhenhua stresses its military connections. On LinkedIn posts, a senior R&D engineer describes working on a "social media cultivation system, and military deployment simulation demonstration system," while a product sales manager discusses "mining military customers' business needs for overseas data." A job posting seeks a candidate that can manage sales and focus "management systems at the direction of the Party, government, and military."
Zhenhua also lists a series of corporate partners with ties to the security establishment. Wenge Group uses big data and artificial intelligence to aid "smart law enforcement." LSSEC Tech provides encryption tools and IT equipment to national security and military customers and has trained its employees to keep secrets on weaponry research. GTCOM sifts social media to spot the development of heated public opinion, equipping authorities to "minimize the probability of group incidents." TRS lists the police and the Communist Party as customers for software services that include online relationship mining, a "public opinion management system" and a "crystal ball intelligence analysis platform." CHRTC provides "urban governance" products to the country's security apparatus.
Zhenhua itself has been granted 10 software patents, Chinese records show, for systems that include searching global think tanks, monitoring personnel appointments and removals around the world, gathering real-time telecommunications content - and social-media account simulation. The latter appears to describe a technology to teach a computerized system to better mimic humans on social media.
"The ultimate intent of this sort of thing is to get attention, to stimulate phony online traffic," said Wu Fei, director of the AI Research Centre at Zhejiang University.
When people see content that has already received thousands of likes or comments, "the majority of which may be created and stimulated by the system - they would immediately be interested."
Zhenhua said on its website that its system manages multiple social-media accounts belonging to virtual humans - bots. When an "assigned task is received, the user can select all social media accounts or part of them to execute the assigned instructions."
Such tools can be used by companies to promote products. But Zhenhua has explained how they could also hold military value.
The company has published extensively on "Number 99 Institute," a blog account on the WeChat messaging app. Its articles reveal an interest in the structure and hierarchy of U.S. intelligence agencies, as well as in future forms of conflict. One, which was also posted to the Zhenhua website, describes social media as important tools for "hybrid warfare," explaining how the manipulation of public opinion through social media can be a cost-effective and powerful way to prevail in battle.
"Social media can manipulate reality and weaken a country's administrative, social, military or economic power," the company wrote. "It can also lead to internal conflicts, social polarization and radicalization in a country."

Full text: It's a photograph that really does speak a thousand words: an overcast, grey-white day in snowy Toronto, with a dirty Gooderham (Flatiron) building on the right, the silvery (and relatively new) Commerce Court in the distance and a lineup of about a dozen people on the left.
In stark contrast to the washedout landscape - and the object of desire for those queuing up - are bright orange, curvaceous letters spelling out "karelia" filling the upper-left portion of the frame, and, underneath that, a warm, wood-slatted interior with colourful posters and housewares.
It's almost as if Torontonians discovered colour on that day.
But, in reality, it was just an ordinary Saturday in the 1970s, and morning lineups at 67 Front St. E.
were not unusual. By the time that photograph was taken, Karelia - the first retailer to bring Finnish design powerhouse Marimekko to Canada - had been in operation since 1959, and its founder, Janis Kravis, had helped educate the city on how to have fun.
"Saturdays, it became a thing for a lot of the design community," Mr. Kravis's youngest son, Guntar Kravis, 56, says. "Go to Karelia and you'd run into your peers ... eventually, there were so many designers and architects that we opened up the coffee shop on Front Street as well, and my mom would make little openfaced sandwiches and we'd get pastries from the Danish Pastry Shop.
"I think Toronto was hungry," Mr. Kravis, a successful photographer, continues. "My dad remembers when they would pull the curtains across the windows at Eaton's on Sundays because they didn't want people to be tempted to shop."
This past July, surrounded by Guntar Kravis and his two brothers, Janis Kravis, 84, passed away.
But his life, and the colourful legacy he left Toronto, would make for a riveting screenplay.
At the tender age of 9, young Janis, his sister and his parents had escaped, via fishing boat, from their native Latvia during the Russian reoccupation; because of the difficulty in arranging pickups due to patrols, the family spent a week living in the forest before embarking for the island of Gotland, Sweden.
After building a life there - Arvids Kravis was an architect and master cabinetmaker - the family chose to relocate to the very conservative Toronto of 1950.
Janis Kravis would be accepted into the University of Toronto's school of architecture a few years later, where he would learn of the legendary architect Alvar Aalto and, by extension, of the Finnish design movement. After graduation, he'd find work with the largest Modernist firm in Canada, John B. Parkin Associates; ironically, when Viljo Revell won the Toronto City Hall competition in 1958, the Finn would be paired with the Parkin office to get his project realized (foreign architects must work with a local firm).
It was around this time that Janis Kravis, then 24 years old, realized he could not find Finnish design in Toronto stores.
"I think it was a timing thing," Mr. Kravis says. "He did have formative years in Sweden so he was exposed to a lot of Swedish design, but then with Viljo Revell's staff, they knew all the dealers, all the people in Finland who were making beautiful things."
So, after receiving catalogues from 20 interested companies, Mr. Kravis sold his used car to finance a trip to Finland, where he met with Armi Ratia, the co-founder of Marimekko (and her son, Ristomatti, who would become a lifelong friend), and other luminaries, and was "able to secure the rights" to represent them in Canada.
The first Karelia was located in the waiting area of a Swedish beauty parlour on Bayview Avenue. Interest was good enough that, by 1961, Karelia Studio Ltd.
relocated to the pre-Yorkville hipster area of Gerrard Street Village (where Toronto's beatniks, artists, poets and intellectuals hung out) where, ironically, a restaurant run by Finns was located across the street.
As more architects and designers discovered the shop, expansion was needed once again, and the next move, to Lothian Mews, brought the company tantalizingly close to the Bloor Street design crowd. Designed by Webb Zerafa Menkes, the intimate, courtyarded space won a Massey Medal in 1964, and was also home to the beloved Hungarian restaurant the Coffee Mill.
A few years after this, Mr. Kravis would design the total interior - including some of the furniture - for George Minden's Three Small Rooms in the basement of the Windsor Arms Hotel. Architect Bruce Kuwabara, a U of T student when the restaurant was "the place to go," remembers that Mr. Kravis "choreographed an intriguing journey" through each room to create "an atmosphere that was immersive and intimate."
Around the time Guntar Kravis was learning to ride his tricycle on Don Mills's Cedarbank Crescent, his parents were considering Front Street, which was met with opposition: "At the time there t was really nothing down there, p and people thought it was a bad e idea in terms of the location, but s Janis [thought] there are thou- t sands of people going to the [St. V Lawrence] market; they'll proba- t bly want to come over here."
Turns out they did, and there c were "fashion shows in the store v [and] at one point Marimekko o came and they set up a whole b screen-printing demonstration t inside the store. t "The parties at Karelia were " just incredible," Mr. Kravis says. o "All this food and everybody smoking and drinking. ... I don't w even know what the reasons for a the parties were, but they were su- " per exciting and there was always t a throng of people." m Of course, Toronto had come a f long way by then. Not only did the w city boast a completed futuristic p (and Finnish) city hall, the buil- a dup and aftermath of Expo 67 (awarded to Montreal in late 1962) K brought new ideas and attitudes. 1 Add the groovy Yorkville scene to J the mix, and it only makes sense k that Karelia was pulsating and place-making, and that it would expand on Front Street to 35,000 square feet, then open other locations in Manulife Centre (1973), in Vancouver and, briefly, Edmonton.
In the rich tapestry of today's cosmopolitan Toronto, Janis Kravis provided a crucial - and colourful - piece. Architect Leslie Rebanks says that he "influenced the acceptance of modern architecture in Canada" and that he "should have received the Order of Canada."
Luckily, says his son, Mr. Kravis was able to celebrate Karelia's legacy in 2019 at the Gladstone Hotel.
"He really felt that that event at the Gladstone was kind of like a memorial that he got to be at," he finishes. "It was a nice party, there were so many familiar old faces, people spoke and said nice things, and he said: ‘How lucky am I?' " Karelia filed for bankruptcy in late 1980.

Full text: 123 Crescent St.
PETERBOROUGH, ONT.
Asking Price: $3,300,000 Taxes: $14,815.75 (2020) Lot Size: 1.18-acre Agents: Jack Cole, Dominic Cole, Miles Groome, Ball Real Estate Inc.
THE BACKSTORY Nancy Waddell first passed by the historic home at 123 Crescent St. in downtown Peterborough, Ont., when it arrived on the real estate market in the early 2000s. The property sat in a prominent location across from the city's Little Lake, but the tired white clapboard exterior did not inspire Ms. Waddell, so she kept going.
"A year later I met the woman who owned it and she invited me for dinner," Ms. Waddell says.
After an evening spent looking out over the lake from beside the backyard pool, Ms. Waddell told her husband she had found the perfect family home in Peterborough.
"It was when I sat on the inside that I really saw the potential," she says of the view from the property. "The road disappears and it just looks like you're sitting right on the water."
According to the City of Peterborough's heritage register, the house was built in the mid-1800s and is likely the oldest building in the Crescent Street area. The property was purchased by Charles Ware in 1871 and was later sold to local butcher and drover Henry Winch.
In 1939, Alleric Letellier converted the building to "ultra-modern" apartments, according to his advertisements of the day.
When Ms. Waddell visited, the dwelling was no longer used as an apartment building, but it still contained some of the remnants of those past divisions. She urged Hugh Waddell to have a look.
"He came to see it and he fell in love with it as well," she says.
The couple had undertaken many renovations over the years and they could easily envision the transformation of 123 Crescent into a grand single-family home again. They purchased the property and immediately began planning the restoration.
THE HOUSE TODAY The old home had lost most of its original features and looked as if it was last updated in the 1960s or 70s, Ms. Waddell says.
"It had flowered wallpaper on the walls and mismatched trim everywhere," she says. "We had to completely gut the whole place."
The couple tore down old additions that cut off some parts of the interior from others. One bedroom, for example, could only be accessed from the rear of the house.
They found one window and one doorway that had trim that matched quite closely. They decided to extend that style throughout the interior.
Similarly, they located one section of baseboard that was substantial but simple at the same time. "We had enough milled for the whole house."
They created an open plan so that light would flow through the main floor. New French windows and doors swing inwards to allow fresh air in.
During the demolition, the couple discovered that the original part of the home was of post-and-beam construction.
Their plan to expand the small kitchen into a larger one wouldn't work because of those heavy wood supports.
"We had two huge posts and beams that we couldn't take down," she says. "We had to add on an entire kitchen."
The former kitchen currently serves as a pantry, while the new kitchen has floor-toceiling cabinets, a large stainless-steel range, built-in appliances and a large central island. There's also a breakfast area and a coffee bar.
The expansion nearly doubled the size of the house to 5,500 square feet.
In addition to the new kitchen, the main floor has a living room, dining room, family room and laundry.
Upstairs, the couple created a large master suite with a reading nook, his-and-hers bathrooms, and walk-in closets.
The Waddells added three additional bedrooms with ensuite bathrooms for their four children.
Downstairs, the basement is partially finished.
After they purchased the property, the Waddells applied to sever two lots. Permission was granted at the time, they say, but a severance never took place.
Over the years, the couple explored the possibility of building a condominium project on the lots, in keeping with Peterborough's aim to increase density, but they decided they weren't interested in taking on a development project.
"It's a very viable option for somebody, but not for us," Ms. Waddell says.
The house is listed on the city's heritage register, but not designated, which means its inclusion on the register does require an owner to provide 60 days' notice of intention to demolish a structure.
Ms. Waddell says the house can remain a single-family home forever.
"It will easily stand another 130 years."
Real estate agent Dominic Cole of Ball Real Estate Inc. says this summer has seen a rush of people from Toronto and its suburbs moving east to Peterborough.
The area provides quick access to cottage country and nearby ski hills, and the city's arts and culture scene is lively, he says. The extension of Highway 407 makes travel to the Greater Toronto Area very smooth, he adds.
"It's really very vibrant now," he says of the city's traditional downtown.
The Crescent Street house is poised right at the edge, overlooking the Centennial Fountain. "You can walk to everything from this location."
THE BEST FEATURE The property sits on a gentle rise above street level, says Ms. Waddell, so people sitting in the backyard can look out toward the lake and watch the sun come across the water. The yard has mature trees, a refurbished in-ground pool and a hot tub.
The secluded cabana has a fireplace and a bathroom. Ms. Waddell likes to use the setting for outdoor movie nights for the couple's grandchildren.
They've also had several big celebrations, including a sit-down dinner for 167 people.
"We had our daughter's wedding there," Ms. Waddell says. "It turned out to be a wonderful place to entertain."

Full text: Vancouver Mayor Kennedy Stewart wants the city to consider temporarily sanctioning a homeless encampment as an emergency measure, a reversal of his earlier position, which emphasized more permanent options.
With changing conditions and COVID-19 cases on the rise, city staff must consider all options, which also include buying units in hotels or single-room occupancy buildings, or temporarily converting city-owned buildings, he said on Tuesday.
But some councillors are wary of the proposal, saying it's the province's responsibility to provide housing. They are instead recommending that the city focus on temporary disaster relief shelters as a short-term measure until hundreds of units of provincial housing come online next year.
The mayor has called a special council meeting for Friday to vote on his motion asking city staff to report by Oct. 2 on the cost and feasibility of the options.
The dismantling of homeless encampments at Oppenheimer Park and Crab Park this year led to a large encampment at Strathcona Park, which is in a more residential area of East Vancouver.
Relocating some campers to a hotel in the downtown core has resulted in growing tensions among some locals, who say they feel unsafe and are uncomfortable with deteriorating neighbourhood conditions, including open drug use by some.
Mr. Stewart previously rejected the idea of a sanctioned encampment, saying the city needs permanent housing solutions, but said on Tuesday that "changing circumstances" necessitated a rethink. Increased visible homelessness and housing projects that won't be ready for months mean immediate, alternate measures must be considered, he said.
"I've been increasingly concerned with what's happening with homelessness right across our city ... if you look at Yaletown, the West End, Crosstown, Gastown, Chinatown and Strathcona," Mr. Stewart said in an interview. "We're really seeing an increase in homelessness, tents where we've never seen them before, folks sleeping rough and, of course, the growing encampment in Strathcona. I've been talking with senior levels of government to see what they might be open to do at this point, but it really seems they need a push from council."
Mr. Stewart's motion asks for staff to work with BC Housing and other government agencies to secure long-term options, and for the mayor to request federal and provincial funding to cover costs associated with any alternatives approved.
Councillor Rebecca Bligh expressed skepticism over the proposal, noting that the clearing of Oppenheimer Park showed that merely providing housing does not work. Some homeless people were moved in May to a hotel purchased by the province, while others relocated to other parks.
"[The hotel] just gets filled up" and nothing changes, Ms. Bligh said. "Why would we do the same thing again? ... We have people who have [single-room occupancy] rooms living in the park." Ms. Bligh also resisted the idea of providing a sanctioned encampment: "We don't want to be seen to be doing the job of the province," she said.
Ms. Bligh and Councillor Michael Wiebe have drafted their own motion proposing a "hyperfocused" plan that would entail talking to homeless people individually about what they need.
Temporary disaster relief shelters would provide services such as harm reduction supports for drug users, housing and health referral, options for both low-barrier and sober living, and traumainformed and culturally appropriate supports, their motion states.
The motion says the shelters would be provided "as a way to facilitate decampments in Vancouver parks, and specifically Strathcona Park," and staff to report after six months on their effectiveness and whether to continue with them.
"We need to make sure we are stepping up as a city," Mr. Wiebe said. Housing is a provincial responsibility, but "it is our jurisdiction to take care of our residents."
The 2020 Metro Vancouver Homeless Count, conducted over a 24-hour period in March before COVID-19 restrictions were enacted, identified at least 2,095 people experiencing homelessness in the city of Vancouver, according to preliminary numbers. This included 547 people who were unsheltered and 1,548 with either no fixed address or who were living in temporary shelters.
Cities across Canada have reported increases in homelessness and related issues during the pandemic. Victoria, which experimented with a sanctioned encampment before the province dismantled it under a public safety order, passed a motion last month that would give priority to housing for homeless people who have lived in the area for more than a year.
In Toronto - which, unlike Vancouver and Victoria, is responsible for its social housing - staff put forward a report last Friday proposing ideas like leasing office space and converting it to housing, turning shelter space into permanent housing and ramping up the construction of temporary modular housing.
That report, going to council on Sept. 22, was prompted by the growth of downtown encampments after shelter space for homeless people was reduced because of safety precautions around the pandemic.
Vancouver's single-room occupancy (SRO) hotels have for decades provided hundreds of relatively affordable housing units, even as residents and advocates raised concerns about health and safety in old, deteriorating buildings. After years of such complaints, the city ordered two of the most rundown SROs, the Regent and the Balmoral, to be closed. The Balmoral stopped operating in 2017 and the Regent in 2018. Together, the two provided about 300 units of housing.
The buildings are owned by companies controlled by siblings Pal Singh Sahota, 81, and Parkash Kaur Sahota, 90, according to court filings.
The city in July, 2018, announced plans to expropriate both buildings. In November, 2019, council voted unanimously to expropriate them for $1 each, based on a city staff report that said it would cost millions to renovate the properties and that the city's efforts to negotiate a purchase with the owners had failed.
The owners in December, 2019, filed a petition for judicial review in B.C. Supreme Court, challenging the city's legal authority to expropriate the buildings and the process it used to approve them.
A court hearing is scheduled for October.

Companies look to sublease space in Toronto, Vancouver as big firms move to make home offices more permanent

Full text: PricewaterhouseCoopers, Cisco Systems Inc. and several other major companies are trying to offload some of their office space in Toronto, as the coronavirus pandemic continues to keep large numbers of office workers at home.
Space available for sublease in downtown Toronto nearly tripled to 1.7 million square feet in August from the end of last year, according to data from commercial real estate company Avison Young. That's higher than the level that followed the global financial crisis of 2008, and it has helped push the office vacancy rate to 3.2 per cent in the downtown core, compared with 2.1 per cent at the start of the year.
The same is true in downtown Vancouver, where the space available for sublease more than tripled over the same period.
PwC, an accounting and consultancy firm, is trying to sublet two floors, or about 53,000 square feet, of its Canadian headquarters in the business node south of the financial core, according to Avison.
Other well-known companies - Oracle Corp., Air Canada, PC Financial and St. Joseph Communications - have recently put some of their downtown Toronto office space on the sublet market, according to the companies or brokers.
"Those are stable, blue-chip companies that are obviously looking to rightsize their premises," said Bill Argeropoulos, Avison's head of research. "The question is, are we going to see others in these sort of professional services arenas or perhaps financial institutions, such as the banks, follow suit?"
A wave of tech companies tried to get rid of their space earlier in the pandemic, including Ritual Technologies Inc., CrowdRiff, Tulip, Rangle.io and other relatively new downtown Toronto tenants.
Now, big companies are looking to shrink their footprint as they keep people at home. Cisco, which is trying to sublet 27,518 square feet at its office by the waterfront, said it was "taking steps to ensure efficient use of our facilities and align for future work force demands," including consolidating larger spaces that are no longer being fully used as its employees "increasingly adopt more flexible working patterns."
Air Canada said with the onset of the pandemic it no longer needed the additional space it had recently leased. PwC said "it is prudent for all companies to evaluate options." Oracle declined to comment. PC Financial and St. Joseph Communications did not respond to a request for comment.
In downtown Vancouver, the increase in subleases helped send the office vacancy rate to 3.5 per cent from 2.6 per cent, according to Avison. (Sublease space is counted as vacant and is included in the vacancy rate.)
Across the Greater Vancouver area, vacancy rates are up 30 basis points to 4.7 per cent over the same January-August period.
Traction on Demand, a tech consulting company, recently put 48,000 square feet on the sublet market. Mobify and Stemcell Technologies Inc. did so earlier in the pandemic.
With most of its staff working from home, Traction reversed plans for a large office and is now seeking a slew of smaller offices throughout mainland British Columbia and Vancouver Island to cut down the commuting and to accommodate a more flexible schedule. "We want to bring our offices to our employees," said Traction chief executive officer, Greg Malpass, who said he was not a big believer in whole offices going virtual because it passes the burden onto employees.
Although most of Canada's economy has reopened, the hub of downtown Toronto office towers has been one of the last areas to revive. Tens of thousands of office employees in the financial district have worked from home since mid-March, devastating the local restaurants, coffee shops and retailers that serve them.
No one knows to what degree working from home will become permanent for the business community. Some big office tenants such as Shopify Inc. and Facebook Inc. have told their employees they can work remotely permanently. Big banks, such as Toronto-Dominion Bank and Bank of Nova Scotia, have told their employees they can stay at home until January. Other companies are experimenting with bringing staff back but at reduced numbers for now. Some landlords say they are getting requests for more space to accommodate physical-distancing requirements.
In the meantime, some businesses are making the decision to get rid of space and conserve cash.
"Our clients are basically saying that they have too much office space and that there are a number of people that simply will not come to work full-time and have dedicated space," said Stan Krawitz, vice-chairman with commercial real estate company Savills Canada, who represents tenants. (He was not speaking on behalf of any of the companies named in this story.)
"It is not necessarily layoffs. It is that they are rethinking, repurposing and reusing their space," he said.
Typically, a company subleasing space will seek to dump it for the rest of their lease term. Demand is not as robust as before the pandemic when all types of companies and entrepreneurs were frantic to secure office space in Toronto and to a lesser extent in Vancouver.
Major office landlords have sweetened their incentives for brokers to secure new leases.
QuadReal is offering brokers a Peloton bike, which retails for about $3,000 in Canada, if they lease a minimum of 5,000 square feet in a new downtown building with a minimum five-year term.
Oxford Properties and GreatWest Lifeco doubled their commission to about $2 a square foot from $1.
QuadReal said the incentive was one of the ways it was working with its brokers during the tough market conditions and said the Peloton bike was a "creative way to focus on health and wellness and acknowledge the current demand for in-home exercise equipment."
Great-West Lifeco CEO Paul Finkbeiner said other landlords increased broker fees so his company was going with the market rate.
Oxford said it recognized it has been a difficult time for brokers with leasing activity slowing down and would pay half of the bonus commission with Oxford gift cards, which will help support retailers.

Full text: A mix of worry and resignation is discernible behind the masks of parents picking up school textbooks in a working-class Spanish neighbourhood with a steady rise in new coronavirus infections.
Authorities in Madrid, the European capital experiencing the worst second-wave outbreak, are introducing new curbs on social gatherings starting Monday. The restrictions coincide with the opening of most schools, which is perceived as a potential tipping point in the battle against the virus.
The focus is especially on areas such as San Diego, a culturally diverse neighbourhood of narrow streets and small apartments where many residents continued commuting to work over the summer, often to do manual labour and unstable jobs.
"The south of Madrid is where the north's cheap labour crams into small apartments," said Simona Filip, 44, a migrant from Romania whose six-year-old son is set to go back to school on Tuesday.
Her son struggled with online learning ever since Spain went into lockdown in mid-March and a non-profit organization gave the family an electronic tablet for the boy to use. "The kid needs proper studies because I can't help him and my husband needs to work," she told the Associated Press this week. "We have no other choice but to hope that the school will keep him safe."
In the past two weeks, Spain has had a cumulative incidence of nearly 213 confirmed virus cases for every 100,000 residents, four times the European average.
But in the southern Vallecas district with San Diego at its centre, that index closely watched by pandemic experts rose to 1,300 last week and remained on Friday above 1,000 cases.
Jorge Nacarino, president of the local neighbours' association, said that poverty and years of inadequate investments for the area are behind the spike. Tiny, cheap apartments built five to eight decades ago have not been replaced and now house extended families or groups of migrants who can't afford real estate price hikes in other neighbourhoods.
As happened during the first wave, social distancing is again difficult in the apartments, and many of those who had contact with people already infected with the coronavirus can't afford to quarantine and miss work, Mr. Nacarino said.
"We need a serious plan of public investment in the area, from health centres and sports facilities to social programs," he said. "It's been through decades of neglect that San Diego has fallen behind the development seen in surrounding areas."
With Spanish unemployment on the rise in the wake of virusinduced lockdowns, "narcoflats," or vacant apartments taken over by gangs as drug distribution and consumption dens, are likely to spread, Mr. Nacarino said. So are gambling parlours, which are seen as a source of social problems in the area, with at least seven establishments operating along a short stretch of one of San Diego's main streets.
Since most of the new recent infections have been tied to gatherings in private homes, the regional government on Friday extended a ban on outdoor gatherings of more than 10 people to include indoor gatherings as well. Attendance to funerals, burials, weddings or religious celebrations, as well as group visits to museums or guided tourism will also be restricted starting on Monday, authorities said.
That comes on the heels of a crackdown on nightlife entertainment, early closure for the city's parks to prevent youth from drinking alcohol and partying in large groups, and a ban on outdoor smoking, all of these measures announced in response to Madrid's spiral of new cases since mid-July.
The Spanish capital, home to 6.6 million and a magnet for workers from around the country, accounted last week for onethird of Spain's new virus infections. At least 16 per cent of beds in Madrid's hospitals are currently occupied by patients with COVID-19, the highest rate of all Spanish regions.
Spain, which is closing in on a half-million confirmed cases since February, is leading the pandemic's second wave in Europe.
At least 29,234 people have died in Spain during the pandemic, although the real number is believed to be higher because many who died during the March and April peak of the outbreak were never tested.
The northern region of Navarra was Spain's first to launch a new school year on Friday, with masks mandatory for all students aged 6 or above and physical-distancing measures in schools.

Full text: Toronto's housing market hit new record highs in August, with sales and prices spiking, as low mortgage rates fuelled competition for homes despite economic uncertainty brought on by the novel coronavirus pandemic.
Last month, 10,775 homes sold in the Toronto region, a 40-percent increase over August, 2019, driven by especially strong demand in the suburbs, according to the local real estate board. Although the volume was slightly lower than in July, last month was the strongest August on record and the third straight month of frenetic activity.
The average selling price across all types of homes reached $951,404, according to the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board (TRREB). Average prices for detached houses and semidetached houses in the City of Toronto spiked just more than 20 per cent to $1,505,100 and $1,166,226, respectively.
"Competition between buyers was especially strong for low-rise home types," Jason Mercer, the board's chief market analyst, said in a statement accompanying the results.
The TRREB home price index, which corrects for distortions in the average selling price, also reached a record high of $890,400, an increase of 11 per cent over August of last year.
With mortgage rates at record lows, it has become cheaper for home buyers to borrow. The popular five-year fixed-rate mortgage rate is below 2 per cent, which allows homeowners to put more of their payments toward the principal debt instead of the interest.
Before the pandemic slowed activity for about eight weeks across March, April and May, the Toronto region's housing market was overheating with properties starting to fetch multiple offers.
But now, there is heightened interest in the suburbs and cities outside of Toronto, with buyers placing a premium on bigger properties and outdoor spaces.
The home price index for every region outside of the City of Toronto recorded a steeper increase than the city's 9-per-cent gain. Durham region's index, east of Toronto, was up 15 per cent year over year.
Realtors in the suburbs have reported properties selling within days of being listed. The softest part of the housing market last month was condos, as more buildings are developed and demand weakens due in part to the slowdown in immigration and desire for larger properties and outdoor space.
Over all, the shortage of properties has increased competition.
Last month, the number of new listings rose 57 per cent and the total volume of properties for sale was up incrementally over last year.
It is unknown how the end of the mortgage deferrals that banks have granted customers and other government aid will affect the housing market when they begin to be phased out this fall.

Full text: There isn't much Zhao Yougang can do to help sell a home in the distant northwest of China these days.
Like many people in Urumqi, capital of the Xinjiang region where a July outbreak of coronavirus cases prompted authorities to maintain a sweeping and lengthy lockdown, Mr. Zhao cannot move around the city.
"We can't take clients to visit houses now," said the real estate agent. "We can't even step out of the gate of our residential communities."
But that hasn't stopped the phone from ringing, as he fields an unusual number of calls from people looking to leave Urumqi. "Compared to the situation a few months ago, there's an obvious increase in the number of people who want to sell," he said.
He pointed to typical late-summer factors, including parents of high-school graduates looking to move to be near their children's universities.
But some callers are motivated by the crushing effects of a pandemic that has played out differently in Xinjiang - a place where authorities have wielded immense power over people's lives, including the forcible political indoctrination of many members of the largely Muslim Uyghur population - than elsewhere.
"Some people can't handle the situation here.
So they decided to leave," Mr. Zhao said.
Inside China, the severity of the pandemic lockdown has earned few comparisons with the treatment of Uyghurs, many of whom have been incarcerated without charges, although authorities have generally won praise domestically for their response to what officials call a problem of religious extremism.
But the anger among Han Chinese residents in Xinjiang at the pandemic measures forms one of the first wide-scale expressions of dissatisfaction at the tactics employed by the region's authorities.
Locking large numbers of people in apartments for weeks and months has created discontent, particularly after the region reported no new cases since Aug. 16.
People in Xinjiang have posted to social media a litany of complaints about local coronavirus measures, which in some cases have been more harsh than those in Wuhan, the city at the epicentre of the global COVID-19 pandemic.
The complaints have been serious enough that authorities responded by posting cellphone numbers of local officials who could respond to complaints.
"There are thousands of families and each of them have different problems now," said Liu Haijiang, a leader in Dabancheng District - an area that is also home to one of the region's largest centres for political indoctrination and skills training, where many Uyghurs have been incarcerated.
Mr. Liu said restrictions in the area had been loosened, and people allowed to step out of their homes.
"We have made our anti-virus work more human and more colourful," Mr. Liu said.
"We've launched various kinds of online activities, and made great efforts to help people secure basic necessities."
Such reassurances, however, have done little to quell anger in Xinjiang. Social-media expressions of unhappiness - photos of at least two people handcuffed to metal fences, personal accounts of people locked inside for 65 days and night-time video of numerous people screaming together in anger from apartment buildings - have been punctuated by messages from people who say they've had enough and now want to leave the region.
Many posts have been censored, creating even more anger.
"I've been under home quarantine since July 15," said Ms. Qi, a woman in Urumqi. The Globe and Mail is not identifying her in full because of the risk of reprisal to people in the region who speak out. Authorities sealed her door with tape. She risks weeks of detention and a large fine if she opens it.
"I've made up my mind, I will leave Xinjiang right away once this epidemic is over," she said.
Since bringing the coronavirus largely under control, authorities across China have received plaudits for their response. New eruptions of the virus in different parts of the country have been met with swift measures to lock down specific areas at risk. In Beijing, an outbreak at a large market in June brought "wartime measures" and mass testing - but was declared under control just two weeks later, after 256 people were infected.
Urumqi, a city of 3.5 million, has reported 826 new cases since July 15. Local authorities have not updated death numbers since the end of July, but have said 2,506 people remain under medical observation, a term that often describes enforced quarantine.
Because the lockdown remains in place for many, people aren't yet able to move freely, much less move homes, meaning accurate statistics aren't available on how significantly pandemic enforcement will affect the willingness of people to live in Xinjiang.
Local authorities denied any problems. "As far as concern about people leaving Urumqi, that's not something I've heard about at this moment," said Qiao Quan, Communist Party secretary in Midong District.
The Chinese government has for years encouraged people from elsewhere in China to move to the region. Three-quarters of the population in Urumqi is Han Chinese, according to the most recent statistics.
For Ms. Qi, the lockdown has been worsened by her troubles in securing the anti-depressants she relies upon. Early in the lockdown, she ran out. "Since nobody was allowed to leave their homes, I mentioned what I needed to the community. But they were unable to get the medicine, either," she said. It was only when she committed self-harm that she was taken to a hospital and provided the necessary medication.
"My mind is filled with unhappiness and disappointment," she said. "The quarantine policy is what has pushed me to this point."
Others have expressed similar sentiments.
"It's true that Xinjiang is a good place. It's also true that the policy here is terrible," one person on social media wrote, after describing previous ambitions to settle down and have a family in Urumqi. "Now for the happiness of the next generation, I will sell my house - maybe in a year, when the real estate market goes back to normal," the person wrote.
Not even immediate removal of quarantine measures would "compensate the hellish pain I've suffered in this past month," wrote another, who described feelings of anger, anxiety, fatigue, loneliness and depression. "The most baffling thing is that I live in a low-risk district, and things are still so ugly. I look forward to the day of being set free and leaving this land behind."
In response to local criticism, officials in Urumqi have cut some taxes and allowed businesses to defer payments of social insurance and other obligations.
But Mr. Zhao, the real estate agent, says it's not enough. Among those looking to leave are people who have "decided to sell their properties here because the epidemic has crushed the local economy, making people's income and life less stable," he said.

After 15 years of silence, son of assassinated Lebanese PM calls for ‘complete divorce' between Lebanon, Hezbollah

Full text: For 15 years after the assassination of his father, Bahaa Hariri avoided public attention while his brother tried in vain to fill the void in Lebanese politics.
In the wake of the Aug. 4 explosion that destroyed the port of Beirut, the eldest son of former prime minister Rafik Hariri decided he could no longer stay on the sidelines. He opened Twitter and Instagram accounts, and began criticizing the corruption that many Lebanese believe led to the port disaster.
Two weeks later, when an international court in The Hague convicted a Hezbollah member of the 2005 car bombing that killed his father and 22 others, Bahaa Hariri went on television to call for a "complete divorce" between Lebanon and the Iranian-backed militia that has taken a stranglehold on his country's politics.
Now, the man who chose to continue with his business career 15 years ago - even though mourners were chanting his name at his father's funeral - is shoulders-deep in the quagmire that is Lebanese politics.
In an interview with The Globe and Mail, he said that he was working with the country's top Christian cleric, Patriarch Bechara Boutros al-Rai, as well as Lebanese civil society leaders, to try to find a prime minister and cabinet that can tackle the twin challenges of ending corruption and disarming Hezbollah.
"Hezbollah and the warlords, and all who supported them for the past 15 years have led us to the abyss. And we are in the abyss - we are not just looking into the abyss anymore," the 54-year-old construction and real estate mogul said by Skype from his temporary base in London.
Mr. Hariri said the combination of the port explosion - which many Lebanese blame on the culture of corruption that allowed a mound of ammonium nitrate to sit unattended in a warehouse for six years - and the guilty verdict delivered by The Hague-based Special Tribunal for Lebanon had fundamentally altered the political map of his country.
"Hezbollah before had the Christians giving them their consent," Mr. Hariri said, referring to the power-sharing agreement reached between Hezbollah, a predominantly Shia Muslim movement, and President Michel Aoun, who is a Christian. "Today, the Christian community is against [Hezbollah], the Sunni community is against, and also civil society and all the moderates of all other religions are against. So, we are not the minority any more. We are the majority."
Echoing the demands of protesters who have taken to the streets of Beirut since last fall - demonstrations that resumed with new anger following the port explosion - Mr. Hariri said that all of those who worked with Hezbollah over the 15 years since his father's murder should be removed from power. "And I mean all."
It's a not-too-subtle jab at his 50-year-old brother Saad, who was drafted into leading Lebanon's Sunni community after their father's assassination. In the name of keeping the sectarian peace, Saad Hariri reached a series of informal agreements with Hezbollah over the past 15 years; until last fall he served as prime minister in a national unity government dominated by allies of the Shia militia.
Under the agreement that ended Lebanon's 1975-1990 civil war, the country's president must always be a Christian, the prime minister a Sunni, and the speaker of parliament a Shiite.
The prime minister's post has been vacant since Aug. 10, when Hassan Diab resigned in the wake of the port explosion, which killed at least 180 people and devastated entire neighbourhoods.
Mr. Diab, whose appointment was supported by Hezbollah, remains as caretaker while the country searches for a replacement who can win the support of parliament.
During the interview, Bahaa Hariri at first insists he doesn't want the prime minister's job for himself "ever." But later, the billionaire businessman said the job shouldn't go to an unknown technocrat who lacked popular appeal - and gave himself some wiggle room to change his mind. "Definitely, I intend to lead in serving my country in one way or another. I cannot say now [in which post] because hasty decisions are bad decisions."
Mr. Hariri's emergence as a political persona - if not yet formally a politician - comes amid swirling international drama over the fate of Lebanon. French President Emmanuel Macron is due to arrive in Beirut on Tuesday to propose a "new political deal" for the former French colony.
Canadian Foreign Minister François-Philippe Champagne visited Beirut on Thursday, to see for himself the destruction caused by the port blast, and to add his voice to those calling for sweeping reforms. "I said to the president and I will repeat it here in the media, listen to the street," he told reporters after meeting Mr. Aoun at his office. Mr. Champagne said that his message was: "Listen to the young people. Listen to these women. ... They want change; they deserve change."
The first step is choosing a new prime minister who can oversee expected early elections. Saad Hariri was initially considered a front-runner to return to the job, but made it clear this week that he wasn't interested in serving a third term.
Some believe his brother is positioning himself as an alternative. "Bahaa is sensing a local gap while his brother Saad continues to lose relevance in both local Sunni leadership and that of Lebanon at large," said Imad Salamey, an associate professor of international affairs at the Lebanese American University.
Prof. Salamey said it was unclear whether Bahaa Hariri's appearance on the political scene was at the behest of Saudi Arabia, historically the main backer of Lebanon's Sunni community, or part of a new Turkish push for influence in Lebanon, a country that was once part of the Ottoman Empire.
Mr. Hariri avoided questions from The Globe and Mail about his links. In the interview, he said that while he wishes Mr. Macron well in his push to encourage reforms, Lebanon's problems had to be resolved by the Lebanese themselves. He said his father's vision was to separate religion and politics in the country, so that merit, rather than sectarian interests, would dictate who got top government jobs.
But on the key question of how to persuade Hezbollah to disarm and relax its grip on Lebanese politics, Mr. Hariri said the decision would be made in Iran, not Lebanon.
"It's not Hezbollah's decision, they don't make the decisions, Tehran makes the decisions," he said. "But at the end of the day, we the people of Lebanon, have had enough."

Full text: THE LISTING A failed condominium development project in Toronto's east end has laid bare a multimillion-dollar dispute between the sons of a former banker who fled charges of embezzlement and fraud in Iran and a family of Saudi Arabian investors.
At the centre of the insolvency proceedings for 1001 Broadview Avenue Inc., initiated in early 2020 by private lender Centurion Mortgage Capital Corp., is restaurant investor Khashayar Khavari.
The report from receiver BDO describes a series high-interest loans and a string of missed payments connected to a land assembly deal in 2017 by Mr. Khavari and his brother Ardavan for a site at the corner of Mortimer and Broadview Avenues in Toronto's East York neighbourhood.
Centurion is the first-ranking lender on the file, and is owed $8,067,628 after agreeing to lend $44-million for construction of a seven-storey condominium building. Despite receiving planning permission for the condo, almost no work has been done aside from the demolition of a popular local eatery and banquet hall known as Whistler's Grille and Café Bar that formerly anchored the site.
"What this community has ended up with is an empty lot full of grass, weeds and garbage, while these millionaires are fighting," said Councillor Paula Fletcher, who voted with Toronto council to approve the project's rezoning.
"It should never have happened," she said. "What the hell are these big money investors doing at this little corner in East York?" The company also owes $146,291 in unpaid property taxes to the City of Toronto.
Some explanation about what went wrong can be found in a set of affidavits connected to a second unsecured mortgage on the property held by a company called 1001 Broadview Investment Inc. The investors in that company include a high-networth family from Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, led by Amr Abdulwahab Attar, who brought an unsuccessful insolvency application for the property in 2019.
Mr. Attar's affidavit provides an intimate look at how wealthy foreign investors came to participate in an investment in Canada's real estate market. He describes meeting Michael Decauni, an executive at the small Canadian investment company Callian Capital Partners Inc. (of which the Khavari brothers were equity partners), in Geneva, Switzerland, in 2015 that led to an investing relationship. "For the past few years, my family and I have been interested in investing in the North American real estate market, and possibly immigrating to Canada. In June of 2017, Decauni told me that he and his partners, Khash, Ardavan Khavari and Khalid Khashoggi ("Khalid"), had placed a deposit on [1001 Broadview] using $2.1-million of their own money, and a further US$10million was required to purchase the land."
Mr. Attar said he had turned down an offer to get an 18-percent return on a $3-million investment when the condo project was complete, but he agreed to invest if his money would get a 15-percent return, paid semi-annually, after being promised his investment would be safe in the event of an insolvency. "Decauni informed me that, more likely than not, the land would be sold at a premium of no less than 25 per cent within the first year, and the Project would not be developed," Mr. Attar said.
In August, 2017, Mr. Attar, his father and sister each pledged $1million to the project, and in November his mother and a cousin named Walid added another $5million (the Walid investment would be structured to be compliant with Sharia law). Mr. Attar himself subsequently joined Callian Capital as an executive.
In 2018, the Attar family members received their scheduled returns: US$75,000 twice that year as the project continued (except for Walid, whose $4-million contribution earned him US$300,000 payments). But in November, 2018, the payments were delayed until January, 2019, after which no further payments were made.
In a responding affidavit Mr. Khavari agrees with most of those events, but he and Mr. Attar disagree as to why the payments stopped. Mr. Khavari alleges demands from Mr. Attar for extra payments for financing fees and legal fees drained the project's budget, while Mr. Attar points the finger back at Mr. Khavari and his brother alleging instances of improper invoices. The affidavits also show that the $2.1-million the Khavaris pledged to the project as equity was actually a high-interest loan from a third party, and funds were also taken out of the project budget to repay that loan.
None of the allegations have been tested in court.
Ultimately, the application to appoint a receiver by Mr. Attar was postponed and his family syndicate must now wait for Centurion's loan to be paid back through the sale of the land before applying to receive any remaining funds.
Missing from the Attar and Centurion filings is some context for the Khavari family. Khashayar Khavari is the son of Mahmoud Reza Khavari, who in 2011 resigned his job as managing director of Iran's state-owned Melli Bank and fled to Canada amid allegations of embezzlement and financial fraud. Iran accuses the elder Mr. Khavari - a dual citizen of Iran and Canada - of helping embezzle US$2.6-billion out of the country. In 2014, billionaire businessman Mahafarid Amir Khosravi was executed in Iran for his role in the scheme. In 2017, according to Iranian state media, Mr. Khavari was convicted in absentia by an Iranian court and sentenced to 30 years in prison.
Bank Melli and another bank Mr. Khavari led have been accused by the European Union and United States of laundering funds intended to finance international terrorism and support Iran's nuclear and missile programs. The allegations have not been tested in a Canadian court, and while Iran has demanded Mr. Khavari's return Canada has no bilateral extradition treaty with the Islamic republic. There is no indication that Mahmoud Reza Khavari is himself involved in the Broadview project.
It's not the first time the family has been involved in court actions in this country. In 2016, details about the Khavari family's business dealings in Canada came to light in lawsuits between them and Sam Mizrahi, a Toronto real estate developer constructing Canada's tallest residential building at 1 Bloor St. Mr. Mizrahi's testimony in those cases described feeling pressured to conceal the Khavari connection to two luxury condo projects on claims that the family's bank accounts in Canada had been frozen after the embezzlement allegations, Mr. Mizrahi also alleged that he was later threatened with financial and reputational ruin by the Khavari brothers.
The court ruled in Mr. Mizrahi's favour, denying the Khavaris the $35-million they were seeking.
Despite the public and acrimonious dispute, Khashayar Khavari continues to tout the connection, describing Mr. Mizrahi as a former "general contractor" on the website for his H&CO Developments website.
Mr. Khavari and Mr. Attar did not respond to requests for comment from The Globe and Mail; Dominique Michaud, a partner with Robins Appleby LLP who is representing Centurion, said his clients declined to comment on the decision to lend money to Mr. Khavari.

Full text: DOG Things you don't need when you're working from home: 1) pants; 2) combed hair; 3) makeup. Shares of Estée Lauder tumbled after the cosmetics giant said sales tumbled 32 per cent in the quarter ended June 30, as closed stores, pandemic-related travel restrictions and the workfrom-home trend hurt demand for foundation, eyeshadow, lipstick and other substances human beings ritualistically smear on their faces. With Estée Lauder also cutting up to 2,000 jobs, there is makeup running everywhere.
EL (NYSE), US$207.01, down US$5.08 or 2.4% over week STAR So bricks-and-mortar stores are dying, are they? Not if Target has anything to say about it. The discount retailer posted a 24.8-per-cent surge in sales for the second quarter ended Aug. 1, as customers concerned about the coronavirus pandemic ordered more merchandise online for instore pickup, drive-up service or same-day delivery fulfilled by the local Target store. With Target's earnings of US$1.69-billion or US$3.38 a share smashing expectations, reports of retailing's death have been greatly exaggerated.
TGT (NYSE), US$153.63, up US$17.10 or 12.5% over week DOG Okay, so not every retailer is hitting it out of the park. Shares of Kohl's cratered after the U.S.
department store chain said sales plunged 23 per cent in the second quarter ended Aug. 1, hurt by pandemic-related store closings and weak back-to-school clothing sales amid uncertainty about when students in many parts of the country will return to class.
With Kohl's margins taking a hit as it discounts merchandise to clear out inventory, shareholders are getting a harsh lesson in the pitfalls of investing in retail.
KSS (NYSE), US$18.90, down US$4.50 or 19.2% over week STAR The coronavirus pandemic has been a disaster for many retail-focused real estate investment trusts. But for CT REIT, it's been pretty much business as usual. The REIT - which derives most of its revenue from Canadian Tire and its affiliated banners - collected 97.3 per cent of rent for the second quarter and recently announced a 2-per-cent distribution increase. The hike - which came earlier than usual this year - "should leave the door open for another increase in [the second half], provided the operating environment does not meaningfully deteriorate," Desjardins analyst Michael Markidis said in a note. REIT on! CRT.UN (TSX), $14.09, up 17 cents or 1.2% over week STAR Number of years it took Apple to reach US$1-billion in market cap: 42. Number of years it took Apple to get from US$1trillion to US$2-trillion: Two. Not that tech valuations have become divorced from reality or anything, but since mid-March Apple's shares have more than doubled, making Apple the first U.S. company to crack the two-trill mark.
With all the money they're making, Apple investors might even be able to afford the latest overpriced iPhone without taking out a bank loan.
AAPL (Nasdaq), US$497.48, up US$37.85 or 8.2% over week

Full text: Russia's top opposition figure was fighting for his life on Thursday, after an apparent poisoning that his allies immediately blamed on the Kremlin.
Alexey Navalny, the loudest and most persistent critic of Russian President Vladimir Putin, and one who had refused to be chased into exile, collapsed while flying home to Moscow from a tour of Siberia to support anti-Kremlin candidates ahead of local elections next month.
In a video posted to social media by passengers on the same plane, the 44year-old Mr. Navalny can be heard howling in pain from inside the airplane bathroom.
Other videos, taken after the plane makes an emergency landing in the city of Omsk, show a seemingly unconscious Mr. Navalny being lifted onto a stretcher, and then into a waiting ambulance.
By evening local time, he was in a coma and breathing with the support of a ventilator. The German charity, Cinema For Peace, said Thursday that it was sending an air ambulance to Omsk to bring Mr. Navalny to Berlin's specialist Charité hospital, where Russian-Canadian activist Pyotr Verzilov was treated after his own suspected poisoning in 2018.
"We suspect Alexey was poisoned with something mixed into his tea. It was the only thing he drank all morning," Mr. Navalny's spokeswoman, Kira Yarmysh, who was travelling with him at the time of the incident, wrote on Twitter. "Doctors said that the toxin was absorbed more quickly through hot liquid."
Mr. Navalny's allies quickly interpreted the incident as an attack on his life. "Why is it the opposition always ends up in intensive care?" political activist Ilya Yashin wrote on his own Twitter account.
Mr. Yashin was alluding to the long list of Putin critics who have died or fallen seriously ill since he took power more than 20 years ago.
Poison is a frequent tool: journalist Anna Politkovskaya fell seriously ill under remarkably similar circumstances - after drinking tea on an internal Russian flight - in 2004. She survived, but was shot dead two years later.
Other poisoning victims include former Ukrainian president Viktor Yushchenko, whose face was disfigured by mysterious dioxins in 2004, and ex-KGB agent Alexander Litvinenko, who died after drinking tea laced with radioactive polonium in 2006.
Earlier in 2018, Sergei Skripal, another former KGB agent, survived an assassination attempt in which the assailants used the nerve agent Novichok in the English city of Salisbury. A British woman died coming into contact with trace elements of the nerve agent three months later.
"It's like a horrible Groundhog Day," Vladimir Kara-Murza, an opposigtion politician who was hospitalized twice after poisonings in 2015 and 2017, told The Globe and Mail. "Poisoning gives the Kremlin plausible deniability, they can say they had nothing to with it - but somehow we have a whole slate of Kremlin critics who have had this happen to them."
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Mr. Putin was aware of Mr. Navalny's hospitalization, and the reports that he had been poisoned. "Doctors are doing everything that needs to be done, the best doctors in Omsk are engaged," Mr. Peskov said. "We certainly wish a speedy recovery to him, like to any other citizen of our country."
However, the scene at the Omsk hospital, where police quickly filled the hallway outside Mr. Navalny's room and prevented even his wife, Yulia Navalnaya, who flew in from Moscow, from seeing him, added to the sinister atmosphere around the incident.
"No one is allowed to see Alexey Navalny, medical records are not shown. His condition is grave," said Anastasy Vasilyeva, Mr. Navalny's personal doctor, who flew to Omsk along with Ms. Navalnaya. Dr. Vasilyeva said she had officially asked the Kremlin to help evacuate Mr. Navalny to a specialist poison-treatment centre in Europe.
However, Anatoly Kalinichenko, one of the doctors at the Omsk hospital, told Reuters that it wasn't clear that Mr. Navalny had been intentionally poisoned.
Dr. Kalinichenko said tests were continuing, and that "natural poisoning" was one of several possible diagnoses.
Mr. Putin wasn't Mr. Navalny's only enemy. The lawyer-turnedpolitical force first rose to prominence a decade ago by blogging about corruption in and around the Kremlin, famously labelling Mr. Putin's United Russia movement "the party of crooks and thieves." That effort grew into the Anti-Corruption Foundation, a team of young activists who scour government contracts and other open-source information, linking suspicious business deals to real estate, yachts and business jets owned by Russia's business and political elite.
While other Russian opposition figures have gone into exile under pressure from the Kremlin, Mr. Navalny remained, enduring repeated arrests and physical attacks. That persistence, combined with his ability to mobilize large crowds of supporters onto the streets of Moscow and other cities, has made him perhaps the single biggest threat to Mr. Putin's grip on power.
He was apparently poisoned at a time when the Kremlin is nervously eyeing a popular uprising in neighbouring Belarus in which hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets to protest against election fraud. The demonstrations threaten to end the 26-year rule of strongman Alexander Lukashenko, an ally of Moscow who has appealed to Russia for help "ensuring security" in Belarus.
Mr. Navalny's Siberia trip was intended to mobilize voters around a slate of anti-Kremlin politicians that he was supporting in local elections there. "If you want to be like Belarus," he wrote Tuesday on his blog, "here is your list of candidates."
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, an opposition businessman who now lives in London after serving a 10year jail sentence linked to his opposition to Mr. Putin, predicted that Mr. Navalny's attack was linked to whatever the Kremlin planned to do next in Belarus.
Mr. Kara-Murza, who moved to the United States after the second poisoning incident, said the focus today should be on saving Mr. Navalny's life. Afterward, Mr. Kara-Murza said, the international community would need to raise its collective voice.
Several European countries released statements of concern about Mr. Navalny's suspected poisoning on Thursday, and both German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron said their countries would be willing to give the Russian opposition leader medical treatment. U.S. President Donald Trump said his administration was "looking at" the reports about Mr. Navalny.
"It's time to call things what they are," Mr. Kara-Murza said.
"The people who did this to him and to so many other people should be held accountable. The propagandists who cover for them should be held responsible.
This impunity is not going to last forever."

Ontario Centres of Excellence to take over OneEleven startup hub

Full text: The Ontario Centres of Excellence, a government innovation agency, is taking over Toronto's OneEleven startup hub after a months-long power struggle over its future.
Both Oxford Properties Group, which is OneEleven's landlord and long-time backer, and the federal-provincial agency confirmed Tuesday that Oxford would transfer OneEleven's brand and intellectual property to OCE after talks that stretched back into the spring.
Technology news websites The Logic and Betakit reported the OneEleven takeover on Monday evening. Oxford spokesperson Daniel O'Donnell said Tuesday that the brand transfer would come at no cost, and that any financial terms would be for a lease agreement. Neither party confirmed the agreement's value.
OneEleven was launched in 2013 as a non-profit and rose to become one of Canada's most well-known startup hubs. The OCE, an agency that funds commercializing new technologies, was one of its original founders, alongside Ryerson University and the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System pension fund, better known as OMERS.
It became a for-profit startup hub in 2018, with its chief backers shifting to OMERS and Oxford Properties Group, the pension plan's real estate wing.
But after the pandemic struck, OneEleven said in April that the prospect of future financial constraints was forcing the hub to shut down permanently, leaving dozens of startups uncertain about their future and 15 staff laid off - despite a staff proposal to keep the hub both open and cashflow-positive, sources told The Globe and Mail in June.
Numerous suitors approached Oxford about the OneEleven brand, including Paramount Fine Foods founder Mohamad Fakih, who hoped to keep the startup hub private rather than government-funded, like many of Toronto's other prominent startup organizations.
OCE has offices in the same Oxford building on Toronto's Front Street West as OneEleven. Oxford said it would lease one floor to run OneEleven, as opposed to the two it operated on prior to the pandemic. Oxford plans to eventually tear the building down for a development called Union Park, but does not expect to break ground until 2023.
The government agency said in an e-mailed statement that it "looks forward to working closely with all of our partners to support the revitalization of an important element of the local tech community and we will share further news in the coming weeks."
An OCE spokesperson said in June that the agency had been approached by several OneEleven companies "to explore opportunities to restore the community and maintain continuity." Oxford said at the time that about a third of the hub's desks for startups had been vacated since the April shutdown announcement.
OneEleven's alumni include Canadian financial technology companies Wealthsimple Inc.
and Borrowell Inc.
"Our involvement with OneEleven has always been driven by our desire to assist Toronto's tech community and we are thankful a solution has been found to achieve this goal," Mr. O'Donnell said in an e-mailed statement.

Full text: This week, real estate agent Alexis Victor will give residents of a small town on the east side of Lake Simcoe their first taste of a phenomenon that Toronto real estate buyers know all too well: Ms. Victor is setting an offer date for her newest listing.
The architect-designed house on the main channel in Lagoon City is an area landmark, she says, but nevertheless, she believes the strategy has never been tried in the community built on canals north of Toronto.
So what's the reaction when she tells other local agents her plan?
"Shock," Ms. Victor says. "All eyes are on me right now, all over town."
Ms. Victor is listing the sevenbedroom house locals have dubbed the "Flying Nun" with an asking price of $1.2-million.
Her target market is the cadre of people streaming out of Toronto during the coronavirus pandemic. Many will expect a bidding war for their city home and they won't hesitate to enter competition in cottage country, she figures.
Multiple offers have begun popping up for high-end Muskoka cottages already.
The health crisis was still a distant threat to most Torontonians when she sold her own semi-detached house near High Park in February. By the time she closed the deal on a three-acre property at the north end of Lake Couchiching, the city was under a state of emergency.
"We moved on April 4th," she says. "The following Wednesday they actually shut down the moving company."
Many people have been asking Ms. Victor if she has a crystal ball.
But she already knew from her own circle in Toronto that a lot of people were feeling the strain of massive mortgages and tiresome commutes. The ability to live mortgage-free was appealing even before work-from-home became the norm.
Her previous career in advertising gave her experience in projecting trends.
"My whole strategy when I got into real estate was bringing city buyers to the country," says Ms. Victor, of Royal LePage Signature Realty.
When Ontario all but shut down in the spring, people had time to stay home and think about a new lifestyle, she says.
"That's when I started to get calls from all of my old ad colleagues," she says.
"People say, ‘I could take my foot off the gas.' " Ms. Victor grew up in the area around Lake Simcoe and she knows what to look for in a rural or lakefront property.
High-speed internet access is at the top of the list of needs for people who plan to continue working, she says. Some country properties have strong WiFi and some areas barely get a cell signal, let alone WiFi.
Even a stand of trees can block transmission, says Ms. Victor, who recommends bringing in a local service provider before purchasing a house.
"Every property's different when it comes to getting a signal," she says.
People who do want to stay in Toronto are making changes as well, says real estate agent Davelle Morrison of Bosley Real Estate Ltd.
"It just seems like people have been cooped up for three months, they're making up plans in their head," she says.
"Decisions that would have taken years, people are doing right away."
Whether they're moving from a small condo to a larger one or a condo to a house, people want more space indoors and out, she says. They also want more light.
If they can't afford to trade up, they're appealing to the "bank of mom and dad," she says.
"People are definitely calling parents a lot more often - no matter their ages."
Ms. Morrison says she has been somewhat surprised at the heat in the Toronto market this summer, but she figures people want to get on with their lives before the uncertainty of the fall.
She's advising her own clients to list now if they're thinking about selling.
Robert Hogue, senior economist at Royal Bank of Canada, notes in a recent report that people continued to pour into the market in July across much of the country.
"Buyers who bided their time at the height of the pandemic clearly have played catch-up these past couple of months, displacing the spring season into the summer," he says. "But so have sellers."
Mr. Hogue expects July's vigour to continue in August - and perhaps September.
"We believe there's still some pent-up demand left to satisfy," he says.
In the Greater Toronto Area, sales gained 29.5 per cent in July compared with July, 2019, data from the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board show.
New listings in the GTA swelled 24.7 per cent in July from the same month last year.
The high demand pushed the average selling price up 16.9 per cent from the same time last year to a record $943,710.
"Supply has not kept up with demand," Mr. Hogue says. "We estimate the GTA swung back into a position favouring sellers."
Mr. Hogue says that Torontoarea buyers were particularly keen for houses in the suburbs.
Sales of detached houses in the 905 area code soared 48.3 per cent and the average price increased 14 per cent in July from the same time last year.
Condo apartments, meanwhile saw sales rise a more tepid 4.7 per cent in the core and 11.7 per cent in the 905 in the same period.
Condo prices rose 8.8 per cent, on average, in the 416 area code and 10.6 per cent in the 905 on a year-over-year basis.
Looking ahead, Mr. Hogue cautions that the phasing out of the Canada Emergency Response Benefit and other financial support programs, high unemployment and lower immigration will likely cool housing demand later this year.

Full text: Lounging on the leather couch, positioned in front of a 12-foot-high window, we watch the summer thunder storm, and its accompanying winds bustle through the tree tops. As I take a slug of my local IPA, the rain whips at the window, coming horizontally in bursts and the tops of the surrounding pines thrash violently, "but see, no movement, totally stable," Cam Green says. "You wouldn't know that we're in a tree house, would you."
Yes, kind of like Tarzan, we are at home in the trees.
Thirteen feet above ground, we're sat in the main living space of a splendidly luxurious tree house. At 370 square feet, with an additional 210 if you include the outdoor deck space, this home-on-high, this tree fort for grownups, is the brainchild of Mr. Green and his partner, Lauren. Costing a cool $300,000, the structure, near Minden, Ont., includes a full bathroom with flushing toilet and shower. There's a king-size bed high in the mezzanine, and the aforementioned living space, which is climate controlled with a heat recovery ventilator, includes sofa, coffee table and propane stove, plus a kitchen area complete with fridge and space for food preparation.
Mr. Green has been fascinated by building in trees since his childhood. "Borrowing" materials from the burn pile behind his parent's cottage on Balsam Lake, he and his buddies would knock together tree houses in the bush, much like many other kids. But, while others grew up and forgot about their aerial construction projects, Mr Green's interest in architecture and the potential for building in trees blossomed. In 2014 he took a course in sustainable tree-house design and construction, at the Yestermorrow Design Build School, in Waitsfield, Vt. "We learned how to build the specialized foundation structure that you need to support a tree house in a growing tree," Mr. Green says. "I'd always wanted to turn my dreams into a reality and now I had the skills to do it."
But, time has a way of getting away on you and it wasn't until 2019 that the couple could begin their build. The design, by Mr. and Ms. Green, and overseen by B.C. architectural designer Lindsay Duthie of Lindsay Duthie Design Studio, is a tale of two parts. Mr. Green focused on the structural and engineering aspects, while Ms. Green undertook the interior and aesthetic design of the building.
Most critical was the attachment to the two red maple trees, which support half of the building's weight. Specially engineered for the project by Oregonbased tree-house guru, Charlie Greenwood, the tree-house attachment bolts (TABs) are a dynamic fixing that runs right through the heart of the tree. The rod and bolt system supports two steel arms that carry heavy I-beams, on which the main structural members of the wooden floor system sit. Additionally, three steel posts support the rear of the building, keeping it totally stable.
"The most important element on this kind of project is, of course, the trees," Mr. Green says. "And with that in mind you must work clean. By that I mean that no dirt or foreign bodies can be allowed to get into the wound that you create in the tree while installing the TAB because they have the potential to infect and damage the tree."
To this end every cutting and boring tool was sanitized, holes were cleaned out and sanitized as soon as cut and a painton sealant that helps the trees heal applied as soon as the TABs were in place.
"The tree is kind of your reason for building a tree house," Mr. Green says, "so protecting it is paramount. Even the ground under it was covered with wood chips and plywood while heavy construction took place. We wanted to be sure not to damage or compact the roots."
The deck on which the building is constructed is massive. Three large 13-inchby-7-inch glued laminated timbre beams form the foundation, upon which Douglas fir joists, each 4 inches by 12 inches are laid. All "float" 13 feet above the forest floor. From here on up, to its 33-foot tall peak, the tree house is a fairly conventional stick frame build.
"The only differences are the corrugated steel structure of the wall around the big window, to stop deflection, and the fact that we used screws instead of nails so that they wouldn't pop due to any unforeseen movement," Mr. Green says.
Aesthetically, the vibe is all clean, modern lines with a "woodsy" twist. This is where Ms. Green comes into her own.
Cedar is the predominant material externally: the deck, penny joint siding and privacy screens for the outdoor shower, all hewn from the hard-wearing wood. Invisible glass handrails border the deck, giving a real sense of being truly among the trees. Inside, the cool grey of the straw and clay floor - a super environmentally friendly product, laid by a local artisan - is complemented by Baltic birch plywood paneled walls and ceiling.
"Lauren has a great eye for this kind of design. I just do the grunt work," Mr. Green says with a laugh.
Signature pieces, such as the mini propane stove and ladder to the mezzanine, are black, adhering to a minimal colour pallet informed by the window and door frames. The bathroom, too, is all dark tones; the hexagonal floor tiles and almost mirror-like black wall tiles contrasting nicely with the quirky, black trimmed white enamel sink.
A chunky leather couch and woollen throw rug soften the aesthetic and add a cozy feel to the living space, which will be especially welcome in winter months, when the family is really looking forward to living amidst the snow blanketed forest.
The Greens have managed to successfully turn a life long ambition into a reality, and a burgeoning business opportunity, as their new tree-house building company, Fort Treehouse Co., gets off the ground (if you'll pardon the pun) with the completion of this wonderful build.
As for the couple's two boys - Arlo, who is two, and Sidney, just weeks old - as they grow up they'll have the best tree house in town. But, it's a safe bet that dad will be helping them build their own, something more rough and ready like those from his childhood, soon enough.

Full text: DONE DEAL 6516 Bowwood Dr. NW, Calgary BOWNESS Asking price history: $499,900 (March, 2020) Asking price: $489,800 (April, 2020) Selling price: $467,500 (May, 2020) Taxes: $3,606 (2019) Days on the market: 71 Listing agent: Kelsey Jones, CIR Realty THE ACTION This 10-year-old semidetached house has been on the market for more than a year, listed with several agents. To offset its location next to commercial businesses and high inventory levels in the neighbourhood, agent Kelsey Jones gave the house a stylish makeover and priced it under $500,000.
Complicating matters, COVID-19 kept buyers away, despite the sellers moving out and strict showing protocols.
"We came to market on March 10, the same week the Alberta government started to impose restrictions and just days before the City of Calgary declared its state of local emergency," Ms. Jones said.
"The sense of fear in the marketplace had already begun, so we knew we had to really get competitive on pricing if we hoped to have a chance of selling at all. We did end up implementing one price reduction to $489,800 to keep some action on the property and encourage showings."
WHAT THEY GOT The 1,625-squarefoot house has three-bedrooms and an additional 775 square feet of living space in the finished basement. There's also a double garage on the 25-foot-by-125-foot lot.
Interior finishes have been upgraded, with granite kitchen counters, new hardwood flooring and a gas fireplace in the living and dining area.
There's an office, four bathrooms and a laundry room upstairs.
THE AGENT'S TAKE "How buyers viewed spaces during this time quickly changed," Ms. Jones said.
"All of the sudden you needed a property where you had space for an office, a place to roll out a yoga mat or complete an at-home workout with gyms and yoga studios shut, and of course a yard so that you could step out and get some fresh air and maybe grow a few vegetables with a lot of the parks being shut down. This home offered the space to do it all."

Full text: TORONTO This week, real estate agent Alexis Victor will give residents of a small town on the east side of Lake Simcoe their first taste of a phenomenon that Toronto real estate buyers know all too well: Ms. Victor is setting an offer date for her newest listing.
The architect-designed house on the main channel in Lagoon City is an area landmark, she says, but nevertheless, she believes the strategy has never been tried in the community built on canals north of Toronto.

For Drew Facey, it's exit, stage left

Full text: Vancouver set and costume designer Drew Facey is a fixture of the local theatre community, designing shows here and beyond for theatre and opera productions, winning 18 Jessie Richardson Theatre Awards along the way. Now, Facey is leaving Vancouver - and theatre. COVID-19 has claimed another professional casualty.
"In one week in March I lost 14 months' worth of contracts," Facey says in his nearly empty East Vancouver condominium, the one he and his partner decided to sell after the pandemic hit (his partner works in hospitality, which has also been hard hit).
"I obviously went through a difficult, dark time emotionally," Facey continues. "I focused singularly for the last 15 years on building this design practice, and it was wiped out in a week. And there was really no kind of sense that companies were going to be supporting artists and that we would be able to survive this."
Seeing the writing on the wall, Facey, 39, spent the past few months retraining in 3-D visualization, while collecting the Canada Emergency Response Benefit. He spent hours each day teaching himself the sometimes frustrating technology. On Thursday, Facey takes off for Merida, Mexico, where he and his partner will open an interior design business in the Yucatan state capital using the complicated digital technology.
His departure is a huge loss for the theatre scene, and a scary sign of what may be to come.
Because of COVID-19, performing arts companies have cancelled their coming seasons - and the contracts that came with them. There is no indication of when it will be safe - or legal - to gather in theatres again.
"The theatre industry is so fragile and freelance theatre artists are so vulnerable," says Facey, who is beloved as much for his positive energy as his creativity. "I worry constantly for my colleagues in such uncertain times and I feel that the conversation hasn't really begun around what's next for all of us."
Facey was born and raised in Kelowna, B.C., where he obtained a subscription to Architectural Digest when he was 10. He studied at Concordia University in Montreal, and in Vancouver at Emily Carr University of Art and Design and Langara College's Studio 58 theatre school. He has worked for a long list of companies, designing nearly 170 professional productions, ranging from The Sound of Music to Shakespearean tragedies to an opera based on Shane Koyczan's novel-inverse Stickboy.
When the nominations were released for the 2014 Jessie Awards, for instance, Facey had a jaw-dropping seven of them, and walked away with the award for Significant Artistic Achievement for his body of work, among others. Most recently, he won the Jessie in June for outstanding set design (large theatre) for Cost of Living at The Arts Club Theatre Company.
"He is a great positive spirit, a mass of talent and he's got a marvellous optimistic encouraging way about him," says Christopher Gaze, the long-time artistic director at Vancouver's Bard on the Beach. "So when you talk to him, you just feel that almost anything is possible and won't it be fun to do it."
It's a lot to walk away from, but Facey is not feeling much optimism about theatre's immediate future.
COVID-19 further highlighted the issues that were already making him uncomfortable about how the industry operates. He felt his life wasn't sustainable - working on overlapping shows, travelling several months of the year, all to support life in an expensive city like Vancouver.
He made a decision to stop working in what he calls dysfunctional situations, or for companies where he has witnessed bullying and racism - he declines to give details - and then felt more centred; he could sleep again. Then the pandemic hit.
"A lot of theatre companies are keeping vague promises of work on the horizon and I think that it is giving artists false hope that their jobs are going to return soon," Facey says. "But when I talk with [artistic directors] about what the future holds, any that I have spoken with are very worried about how limited programming and opportunities are going to be when and if theatres reopen."
He is also frustrated with the pandemic divide between freelance artists like himself, and some people employed in senior positions by theatre companies.
"They're working, they're collecting their salaries, they're going to work every day. And then on the other side of it, you have the actors and choreographers and directors and designers and everybody else, and we're all out of work," Facey says. "That is frustrating. And knowing that that doesn't seem like it's going to change any time soon is difficult."
We were speaking a few days before his departure, and Facey pulled out his laptop to demonstrate his new line of work. He scrolled through a series of photos of a derelict property in Merida; then new photos, reimagining digitally what the home could look like. This kind of 3-D visualization can help a real estate agent sell a property; then maybe Facey will get an interior design gig from whoever buys the place.
"I feel like I grieved this career that I spent 15 years building and sort of went through this quite dark process and then made a decision that I had to just be strong and build out. I built a design business once; I can do it again," he says.
He is clearly excited about the work. But his departure leaves a chasm - that likely won't be unique.
"It's a sad testament of this pandemic that people will be changing gears; they'll be finding other ways to earn livings. And maybe they won't come back to the theatre," says Gaze, who worries about losing all that experience and depth. "It's dangerous.
And there could be many losses over the next while."

Full text: Unless one is in a forest, with dappled sunlight dancing at one's feet, birdsong tickling the eardrums and a soft breeze rustling the leaves, calm does not come naturally. Calm is created by design.
That fact is evident in the kitchen of Zaiba Mian, interior design professor at Humber College, and her husband, Jeremy Mendonca, an interior designer at Diamond Schmitt. Here, during a recent walkabout with your humble Architourist, the conversation changed from the planning and implementation of recent renovations to their 1890 Victorian home in South Riverdale to that of travel and inspiration.
Mexico City's beauty, Chicago's influence and the sculptural qualities of Brasilia were discussed. "To think about design as a sculptural form that informs people's movement through space, but just on a larger scale," Ms. Mian said, "that's why Brasilia was one of the most amazing places."
We spoke about how architecture students don't receive enough education about interiors, but they should. It's the human-scaled stuff we touch and interact with, after all.
But back to the kitchen: As with most Victorians, it's at the rear of the house. But while most self-confessed "modernists" and "minimalists" would blow out the back wall and add some sort of glass box, here, window openings have been left untouched.
The kitchen, therefore, remains sheltering and cozy. Yet, since it contains angular, logical millwork without distracting handpulls, a palette of only creamy white, chrome and stainless steel, the eye and the mind can rest - and with rest comes introspection and a conversation change.
Similarly, one room over - separated by a monumental tall white cabinet of Mr. Mendonca's design - diners experience calm through a large, round marble table purchased on Gerrard Street long before the renovation, a translucent marble-shaded fixture from Britain, and lightweight sculptural chairs by Italian manufacturer Pedrali. Only when one of the couple's cats walks through the gap between cabinet and wall and burbles a kitty-hello does one become distracted.
"We didn't leave [the gap] for the cats," Ms. Mian says with a laugh. "We left it so that it does look like a piece of furniture rather than taking it to the wall."
Walk any further toward the front of the house, however, and things get busy, visually. In the double living room, foyer and hallway, it's a riot of high baseboards, crown moulding, wooden window frames, plaster ceiling medallions, arches, an ornamental fireplace and a staircase that would wow Scarlett O'Hara.
Upstairs, too, restored hinges and a curious coffered ceiling made from stair handrail off-cuts make for a visual feast that causes the contemporary brain to race, to inspect, to marvel. Only a visitor from H.G. Wells's time machine would feel calm here.
But that's okay, Ms. Mian said, because "the guy who lived here was so interesting," and he'd done such a meticulous job of restoring so much of the Victoriana, it was decided that "whatever has value, we will leave, and anything we add will be contemporary, but we will respect the integrity of the architecture."
According to a 21/2-page, singlespaced "dissertation" handed to the couple when they purchased the house in 2003, the previous owner, Sean O'Reilly, spent "more than two decades" on a "Quixotic quest" to restore as many features as his bank account would allow.
The staircase, in particular, needed to have missing or broken balusters "respindled" at "a mere cost of $1,000 for a set of seven spindles!" the unnamed author exclaims. Mr. O'Reilly's life was "cut short before he could complete the restoration," he or she continues, and the dining room and kitchen were restored only "in part."
In fact, the house and Mr. O'Reilly's quest were so well known in this tight-knit neighbourhood (now a Heritage Conservation District) that, in their first few years of ownership, Ms. Mian and Mr. Mendonca received a number of visits by local craftspeople who claimed they'd worked on a particular piece or project.
"This is the first time we walked into a place with such a strong presence," said Ms. Mian, who remembers looking at 52 houses before choosing this one. So strong, in fact, that the couple didn't do anything for the first decade and, when they finally did wield their drafting pens, chose "insertions" rather than big moves.
But little insertions can provide big payouts. In the couple's backyard, for instance, a wide barn door to the alleyway and a rusting steel wall to shield diners from the parked car make for a warm and welcoming space. On the second floor, the renovation of the bathroom and the addition of thin strip lighting to illuminate artwork is all that's required to contemporize the space. Of the master bedroom, Ms. Mian says, "we didn't do anything."
In the front rooms downstairs, only sexy, black-and-tan flooring - leftovers from a W Hotel in Atlanta Mr. Mendonca worked on while employed at Burdifilek - and thin-framed doors into the hallway have been inserted, yet these add thick modernist layers to the Victorian onion. In fact, the couple has even added to the Victorian charm by placing Ms. Mian's mother's antique sofa and rug here - when in Rome, right?
Over all, Ms. Mian's and Mr. Mendonca's handling of two very different eras is deft and inspiring; any future owner could take things in either direction, designwise, and have an easy go of it.
"It's not our place," Mr. Mendonca said. "In the time that we'll have this house, to ruin those things or set them back? All we've tried to do is bring more light in and fix the systems."
"We didn't want to decorate anything," Ms. Mian said.

Full text: 11 Checker Court, Vaughan, Ont.
THORNHILL Asking price: $998,000 (April, 2020) Previous asking price: $1,125,000 (March, 2020) Selling price: $940,000 Previous selling price: $301,000 (1990) Taxes: $5,060 (2020) Days on the market: 16 Listing and co-op agent: Belinda Lelli, Royal LePage Real Estate Services Ltd.
THE ACTION The owners of this detached house could not avoid listing it in late March, so their agent devised strict viewing protocols, increased cleanings between visitors and provided sanitation stations. After a couple of weeks of sluggish buyer turnout, the price was dropped by $127,000 in April.
"The [market] conditions weren't the same [as] the month previous, so we priced it to sell and we had five offers in two days," agent Belinda Lelli said.
"The sellers made the decision to choose a lower-priced offer that was firm with a quick closing. The sellers did not want to take any unnecessary risks given the uncertainty of the real estate market during the COVID-19 market."
WHAT THEY GOT This 2,128-squarefoot house was built on a 30foot-by-110-foot lot about 30 years ago, with formal living and dining rooms. It also has a family room with a gas fireplace above the double garage.
Casual lounging can also be done in the rear sunroom, which exits to a south-facing backyard, or the basement, which features open entertaining area and a second kitchen.
Upstairs, the largest of three bedrooms contains a walk-in closet and fourth bathroom.
THE AGENT'S TAKE "An above average home inspection and a separate entrance to a fully finished basement helped to draw great interest, as the potential for rental income was attractive to the majority of buyers," Ms. Lelli said.
"This home, situated on a quiet cul-de-sac, is ideal for young families. Schools, parks and shopping are also within walking distance, as is the local community/recreation centre."

Full text: Canada's two hottest real estate markets spiked for the second straight month, hitting record sales for July and pushing up prices as low mortgage rates and limited supply boosted competition despite the pandemic.
In the Toronto region, sales jumped 30 per cent over the previous year, to 11,081 homes, and the average selling price rose 17 per cent to a record $943,710, according to the local real estate board. The sales were 50 per cent higher than June, when activity rebounded sharply after two months of pandemic restrictions.
In the Vancouver area, sales increased by 22 per cent compared with July, 2019, to a record 3,128 homes, according to the local board. That was nearly 10 per cent above the 10-year sales average for July, and 28 per cent higher than June.
"We're seeing the results today of pentup activity, from both home buyers and sellers, that had been accumulating in our market throughout the year," Colette Gerber, chair of the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver, said in a statement. "Low interest rates and limited overall supply are also increasing competition."
Mortgage rates have dropped to record lows, with some lenders offering five-year fixed rates below 2 per cent, pushing up home prices and making it easier for homeowners and potential buyers to pay off home loans.
"Low interest rates are the rocket fuel that drives house prices," said Carl Gomez, an independent real estate economist.
Although more homeowners put their homes up for sale in the Toronto and Vancouver areas as the pandemic eased, the total inventory of available properties in each market was approximately 15 per cent below July of last year, making it harder for buyers.
In the Toronto region, the rise in the average selling price was driven in part by detached houses, which soared 26 per cent to $1,541,003 in the city of Toronto and climbed 14 per cent to $1,060,318 in the surrounding suburbs, according to the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board.
From June to July, the average selling price across all types of properties was up 5.5 per cent.
The home price index, an industry calculation that helps mitigate distortions from the top end of the market, rose 10 per cent year-over-year in Toronto to a record $880,400.
Before the pandemic, the board forecast the average selling price for the year would be $900,000. The board did not say whether it would update its forecast, but said increased competition "fuelled a further acceleration" in price growth last month.
"The market seems to be extremely hot in certain sectors," said Shawn Zigelstein, a broker with Royal LePage Your Community Realty in Toronto. "The freehold market in both the suburbs, as well as the city, all seem to be selling very well, and as long as they are priced well, are getting multiple offers and much more showing interest than we've seen in recent months."
In the Vancouver region, the home price index climbed 4.5 per cent over July of last year to $1,031,400. Detached houses rose by 5 per cent, followed by semidetached houses and condos, according to the price index. The month-to-month price change was up incrementally.
Some realtors have speculated that this summer was the delayed spring selling season, which is normally the busiest time of the year. But Ms. Gerber dismissed that theory, and said so far the rebound is similar to what occurred after the Great Recession of 2008-09 and the 2015 oil crash, when renewed confidence in the country's economy reignited activity.
"Once people see that things will be okay, the economy is going to recover, they will keep their jobs. ... When you see there is stability, that is when you step back in the market," she said.
The jump in sales last month in Vancouver more than mitigated the eight weeks of tepid activity early in the pandemic. Sales from January through July have surpassed the number over the same seven months last year. "I couldn't believe the numbers," Ms. Gerber said.
Although a shortage of properties has spurred bidding wars and homes selling well over asking prices, record-low mortgage rates are also contributing to severe price inflation.
However, Mr. Gomez said that the summer rebound may not be sustainable.
"Like the economy itself, I feel like things are likely to cool off after this initial rebound," he said.

Full text: In the dining room of Jason Bykewich's childhood home, his parents had a black-and-red candelabra with a fiddlehead shape. As a baby, he was drawn to this fixture. When his father carried him past it, he'd grasp at it. "I wanted to touch it and see it up close," he says. He was similarly transfixed by the ornate balusters beneath the armrests of the livingroom couch. He's disinclined to read too much into these childhood fascinations.
Clearly, even then, he liked irregular shapes. Perhaps it was their distinctiveness that appealed to him. Or their resemblances to natural forms - snail shells, tendrils, aloe plants.
As an adult, Mr. Bykewich developed an interest in Art Nouveau - the decorativearts trend that flourished in Europe and the British Isles from 1890 to 1910. The Nouveau movement - with its sinuous, elongated and asymmetrical forms - took inspiration from wild nature. It was a folksy alternative to the neoclassical style, which was all about symmetry and grandeur and had dominated for much of the previous two centuries.
When Mr. Bykewich and his wife, Geneviève, a journalist, acquired a $405,000 property in Edmonton's Old Strathcona neighbourhood, he saw a chance not only to build a forever home for his family (the couple has two young boys) but also to experiment with curvilinear shapes, the kind you don't often see on the Prairies. As the principal of Ethos Engineering, a local consulting firm, Mr. Bykewich possessed the expertise necessary to pull such a project off. And while the house is by no means an exemplar of Art Nouveau design - it feels, with its heavy timber, rough finishes and rugged masonry, very much like a Prairie home - it nevertheless draws loosely on Nouveau principles. It is an assemblage of irregular, curvy forms in a city where such things are rare.
If, in Edmonton and elsewhere, homebuilders tend to prefer angular over curved structures, it's partly because these are the easiest forms to create. Lumber comes in planks. Bricks and cinderblocks are rectangular. To arrange or stack these materials in the most sensible way is to build a house that looks, well, like a house - a boxy structure, perhaps with a gabled or hipped roof.
Sure, you're free to bend the walls or sculpt the rooms if you want to, but this takes effort, time and engineering savvy.
On the other hand, when else was Mr. Bykewich going to get such a chance?
"This was the first project in my career where I had a blank page," he says. "I thought, ‘If I want to realize some of the crazy ideas that have been floating around in my head, what would that look like?' It's not very often that you get an opportunity to build something from scratch."
Using Autodesk Revit, a 3-D-modelling application, he designed a two-storey, 1,950-square-foot home with a rounded front façade, a terraced second-floor balcony and two main spaces - a kitchen-dining area with concrete floors on the ground level and a living room with maple floors above - both with irregular shapes.
(The more conventionally shaped master bedroom is tucked behind the upstairs living room, and the children's bedrooms are in the basement, overlooking a lightwell.)
To produce curved walls, a builder must find ways to make rounded forms out of rectangular materials. Using a jigsaw, Mr. Bykewich cut sinuous, parabolic strips of plywood. These pieces served as the bottom plates for the walls. He mounted vertical studs on top of them and then wrapped the drywall, which had been watered down to increase malleability, around the studs so that it mimicked the curvilinear shapes of the underlying plates.
The walls aren't the only distinctive feature in the home. Mr. Bykewich had all of the front-facing windows custom fabricated; like the rooms, they are more pondshaped than circular. The exposed beams on the ground floor are arranged in a treelike pattern. Thick spans of Douglas-fir glulam, an engineered wood product, extrude diagonally from a central concrete column. These pieces then bifurcate and give way to lighter beams, just as a bough gives way to branches and twigs.
The best element in the house is the first one you see. In the foyer, a few feet past the entrance, Mr. Bykewich set a fivefoot-high trombe wall - a masonry structure that absorbs solar energy streaming in through the windows, thereby cooling the interiors by day. It is clad in a mixture of found stones and salvaged bricks, all set in a "free lay" pattern: the rows bend and turn randomly, as if drawn by hand. "The wall looks geological," Mr. Bykewich says, "like a natural deposition."
These unique flourishes belie the technical sophistication of the home, which is outfitted with thick exterior walls, an energy-recovery ventilator and a hydronic heating system, whereby water is pumped though a network of tubes beneath the floors. Unlike a conventional radiator, which blasts heat from a fixed point, this system runs everywhere and therefore heats the home with minimal energy inputs. To get a room up to a comfortable 20 degrees, you must heat the water to a mere 22 degrees. Because he put in much of his own labour, Mr. Bykewich kept construction-and-material costs down to $475,000, and he expects to save on energy expenditures as the years go by.
For such an experimental project, there's a strong element of Prairie pragmatism at play. The house has little of the delicacy one associates with Art Nouveau. But that's not the point. Imagine an alternative universe in which elements of Nouveau had somehow migrated to the Prairies and become enmeshed, however vaguely, in the local building vernacular.
Mr. Bykewich's house exists in such a world. When discussing his stylistic choices, he speaks not in the manner of an effete craftsman but rather like a pioneer homesteader. "This is our piece of land," he says. "We can do whatever we want with it."

Full text: THE LISTING A power struggle for control of the condominium board at the exclusive Shangri-La Hotel and residences has spilled into Ontario Superior Court with residents filing applications arguing the board is no longer a legally constituted governing entity following a raft of resignations.
At stake for the sole remaining elected board member, board president Mario DaMicheli, is control over the building's $7-million budget and the clout that comes with it. In the year since Mr. DaMicheli took control of the Toronto Standard Condominium Corporation No.
2258 ("TSCC 2258"), he and his board allies have fired and hired multiple condo management firms, and battled with the Shangri-La hotel management - including withholding hundreds of thousands of dollars in payments for water and shared amenities. The condo also now faces a demand from City of Toronto building inspectors to immediately undo unpermitted construction work city staff says threatens critical fire-safety systems.
Internal conflicts over the management of the high-end condo building have simmered for years, but residents who spoke to The Globe and Mail claim a breakdown of normal governance has accelerated in recent weeks. On July 2, Ross Barristers brought an application on behalf of building residents Althea Dempsey and Leonard Eisen, alleging the board of directors of TSCC 2258 lost quorum on June 17.
The residents are asking Justice Carole Brown to invalidate three recently appointed directors: Fadi Swaida, James Obaji and Ash Singh. It also seeks to stop the board from making decisions for the corporation until a new board can be elected, and appoint an administrator to run the corporation through to an impartial election process at the annual general meeting (currently scheduled for Aug. 24). A hearing was to take place to this week.
Affidavits filed in the case provide a window into the conflict. The board needs three of its five members present to have the quorum to legally act. The question of quorum centres around the timing of resignations of three members - William Waldman, Vito Romita and Ian Sansom - in mid-June.
After the publication of a Globe story about dysfunction at the condo on June 10, Mr. Romita and Mr. Sansom resigned their director roles on June 14 and 15. The application claims that on June 16, 2020, TSCC 2258's corporate lawyer Carole Dirks advised the board not to appoint any more voting members, but later that night Mr. DaMicheli arranged an emergency board meeting via teleconference and proposed Dr. Swaida, a dentist, as a new voting member.
The affidavits from Mr. Waldman and Mr. DaMicheli agree on some elements of what happened on that call, but their interpretation of the events stand in stark contrast.
According to Mr. Waldman, the mention of new directors caused him to interrupt the call to object to any such course of action and then hang up without registering a vote on the proposed candidate, denying the meeting quorum and ending its legal ability to decide corporate matters.
Mr. DaMicheli suggests in his affidavit that Mr. Waldman abstained on Dr. Swaida before hanging up: "Waldman did not voice any objection at that time to Dr.
Swaida's appointment to the Board. As such, in keeping with the board's standard practice, the decision to appoint Dr. Swaida was deemed to have been ratified." Mr. Waldman disputes any claim of a vote or an abstention and maintains the board - with only two members (Mr. DaMicheli and recently appointed Arsalan Poorsina) left in the meeting - had no quorum to decide anything after he left the call.
That same night, building property manager Daniel Mousavi of Nadlan Harris Property Management Inc. sent an owners an Information Certificate Update claiming Mr. Swaida had been added to the board.
The next day, June 17, Ms. Dirks sent the board an e-mail warning them "this is not a legal appointment under the Condo Act or By-law No. 3 of TSCC 2258," concluding this way: "there is a problem now because you have made a public announcement of an appointment that is neither legal or effective. Dr. Fadi has no authority to do anything on behalf of the Corporation in these circumstances."
Mr. Mousavi responded in an e-mail The Globe has obtained, chastising the lawyer for not co-ordinating with Mr. DaMicheli or himself and told her not to bill the corporation for this legal advice.
Mr. Waldman resigned from the board the same day, after Ms. Dirks's e-mail. The application claims the board now only has two legal directors, as Mr. Waldman's departure from the teleconference deprived the board of quorum to appoint Dr. Swaida, and his resignation the next day ended the board's quorum to make any future decisions.
Two more board members - Mr. Singh and Dr. Obaji - were added in subsequent days, and Mr. DaMicheli stated in an Affidavit on July 17 this new board "has not caused TSCC 2258 to enter into or terminate any major contracts." Despite that assurance, the building's own minutes from a June 22 meeting show the new board members voted to terminate its largest contract: a $630,000 annual contract with Condor Security. It has also adopted a reserve fund study and raised the condo fees 2 per cent, approved a window cleaning contract and began negotiations to change the valet service provider.
In recent days bulletins posted in the building and distributed on screens in the elevators have proclaimed the new board is working on a raft of new services for residents. Also, the board has moved the AGM from September to August and has rejected calls for a third-party administrator to run the election for five new members.
"The conduct of DaMicheli, Poorsina and Mousavi [the property manager] since June 16, 2020, demonstrates that these individuals cannot be trusted to manage the corporation's Affairs," the application states. "In particular, they cannot be trusted to organize and run a fair AGM in a month," the application alleges, going further to accuse Mr. DaMicheli of creating a "toxic environment" on the board. None of these allegations have been tested in court, and the resident's lawyers have not been willing to comment on the proceedings.
"Our firm has a policy of not discussing matters that are before the courts," said Eric Brousseau, associate lawyer with Ross Barristers.
"Our goal until the AGM election is to unite owners in an effort to find an amicable resolution to the current litigation, in a civil and fair manner, and we invite the Plaintiff to join this approach instead of wasting owner dollars," Mr. DaMicheli wrote in an e-mailed response to Globe questions. Mr. Mousavi did not respond to a request for comment. Mr. Poorsina could not be reached for comment.
The latest urgent issue to arise is a July 21 directive from city building inspectors that The Globe has obtained.
"I am reviewing the violation orders issued by Toronto Building, and came across the above order that was issued by us on May 15th, 2020 and is still no compliance has been achieved. I am involving Toronto Fire Service also, since it is a serious matter that the Sprinkler room/Mechanical room [1808] has been divided to create an office space," wrote Surindera Gupta, senior building inspector with the City of Toronto. "Since it is a life safety issue, therefore, compliance has to be achieved immediately without any further delays. You would have two weeks to assist us in achieving compliance, failing which, we shall initiate legal process including issuing tickets for Building code violations." Mr. DaMicheli did not respond to questions on this subject.
The corporation's relations with the hotel have also degraded. In a recent newsletter to owners, the board claimed it was seeking a $300,000 rebate on a water bill, and was withholding another $252,000 from the hotel it is required to pay under a reciprocal agreement that covers the funding of amenities shared by hotel and condo residents. The Globe has obtained a sharp e-mail rebuke from Theo Ong, an executive at Westbank, the developer of Shrangri-La and owner of the hotel franchise. It demands the condo corporation meet its obligations.
"On a few occasions now you have indicated that we have a good working relationship with you and the board. I can unequivocally say that THIS IS NOT TRUE, rather it is the complete opposite," Mr. Ong writes to property manager Mr. Mousavi. "I am at a point now that I do not even know if we can work with you or your board - as your behaviour is not how a condo corporation should be run."
Mr. Ong declined further comment.

Full text: Like many realtors working Canada's recreational markets, David Jurek says he's seen properties move unusually quickly since the start of COVID-19.
The Re/Max real estate agent in 100 Mile House, B.C., recently listed a $140,000 home in an off-thegrid region where he's had difficulty in the past: "The last and only sale that we had there took about three years to sell," Mr. Jurek says. "I listed this property thinking, ‘Okay, well, this year maybe we'll get more action.' " But shortly after listing, Mr. Jurek started receiving daily inquiries on the house. Before long, he had three offers on it.
"Some of the stuff that normally would sit, that wasn't as choice of a property necessarily in the past is now selling very quickly," Mr. Jurek says.
He attributes the quick heat-up in the B.C. recreational property market to COVID-19 lockdown orders, part of a growing trend in which Canadians are looking to vacation property in search of space, an alternative place from which to work remotely or a driveable vacation destination while travel is not an option.
He's seen month-over-month sales increase by an estimated 30 per cent in his region since the start of the pandemic. And while demand has risen across the market, he says prices have yet to climb to match, so those looking to buy should explore their options quickly.
The same has occurred in the greater Vancouver region, home to the Sunshine Coast and Whistler, according to Colette Gerber, realtor at Sutton West Coast Realty and chair of the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver. "Last month we saw a 21-per-cent increase in sales," Ms. Gerber says.
The Muskoka region and other parts of Ontario's cottage country have seen similar upticks in demand, according to David Reid, sales representative at Enjoy Muskoka Realty in Gravenhurst, Ont., and former president of the Ontario Real Estate Association.
"One of the big drivers really is high speed internet," he says.
"You've got such great quality internet now and the paradigms have changed."
Not every cottage comes with strong cell or web service, of course, and for many this is a nonstarter. Those unfamiliar with the area in which they're shopping should look for a realtor who knows the region well, all three agents suggest.
While this rule typically goes without saying, it's especially important when searching for lakefront, rural and two- or three-season properties, which come with their own quirks. In B.C., for example, it's important to understand the underground system from which a property sources its water, Ms. Gerber says. "You need local knowledge to know what the ramifications are, how to deal with a well, how to deal with septic fields," she says.
Recreational properties also come with their own specific maintenance requirements.
While year-round homes have owners' constant attention, summer spots need an extra set of eyes (and hands, in the event of snowfall) during colder months.
Mr. Reid suggests finding a helpful neighbour or enlisting the services of a local road maintenance or cottage sitter program, such as Muskoka Cottage Sitters, which typically comes with fees of a few hundred dollars a month but offers owners peace of mind and protection from accidents.

New condo sales in the GTA drop to lowest level since early 2009

Full text: New condo sales in the second quarter in the Toronto region fell to their lowest level since the Great Recession, as developers stopped launching projects when the COVID-19 pandemic shuttered the economy and slowed home building.
The largest residential market in the country had a total of 1,385 new condo sales in April, May and June, according to Urbanation, an industry group which tracks condo building trends in the Greater Toronto Area. That was the weakest activity since early 2009 when the global economy cratered after the U.S. housing crash.
The sales were down 85 per cent compared with the same period last year, which Urbanation said was attributed to fewer project launches. Over the second quarter, six projects totalling 1,176 units were launched.
That was down substantially from the same period last year when 40 projects totalling 11,415 units launched.
"There was a delay in launches. Everyone was apprehensive due to COVID," said Rodrick Wallace, a realtor with IPRO Realty, who works with condo investors and home buyers.
The average selling price of new condos across the GTA weakened to $889 per square foot from $903 a year ago, with four of the six new projects outside of the expensive downtown core.
Noëlla Ingabire, a realtor with Re/Max Condos Plus, said she is selling more townhouses now than condos. She said her condo investors are looking for deals but there are none to be had in downtown Toronto.
Condo weakness is also playing out in the resale market where they have shouldered steeper sales declines than detached and semi-detached houses. In June, condo sales in the Toronto region were down 16 per cent compared with last year, though the average selling price was up by 7 per cent to $631,704, according to the local real estate board. In contrast, resales of detached houses climbed and the average selling price soared above $1-million in the city and the surrounding suburbs.
"It will take a few more months to tell how much underlying housing demand has been permanently impaired by the recession," said Robert Hogue, senior economist with Royal Bank of Canada. "This is especially true for the new condo market where first-time home buyers and investors play significant roles," he said.
It has been harder for firsttime home buyers to get a big enough mortgage to buy in Toronto, with home prices climbing and increasingly stricter loan qualifications. In the first half of this year, first-time home buyers accounted for fewer mortgage registrations in Ontario than in the same period during the Great Recession, according to new data from Teranet, which operates the province's electronic land registry system.
For investors, who make up nearly 40 per cent of condo owners in the Toronto region, the investment strategy of covering mortgage payments with rental income or expecting prices to climb is less compelling. The pandemic has slowed migration to the city, dried up tourism and slashed jobs. That, coupled with an influx of new condos and Airbnb units turning into longterm rental apartments, has pushed rental vacancies slightly higher and rental prices down.
"The investment strategy of most condo investors has, for the most part, not been about cash flow, it's mainly been about speculative future price growth," said Carl Gomez, an independent real estate economist. "If investors do not feel confident about the potential direction of condo prices in the future, then they will bail today. And I think that's exactly what they are doing," he said.
Mr. Wallace said he is telling his condo investors to stay away from preconstruction condos in downtown Toronto at the moment given the price per square foot and softening rental market.
"It is probably not the best investment right now," he said.
Despite the lacklustre second quarter, the surge in resales and home building in June has given developers confidence to launch projects this year. Urbanation said it expects to see an improvement in the third quarter. So far, more units were launched in July than in the entire second quarter.

Full text: A silver, 37-storey office tower in downtown Calgary has sat devoid of any workers since mid-2019 and is frequently held up as a glaring symbol of the economic slump that has ravaged the city's commercial real estate market.
At the former headquarters of Nexen Inc., doors at the street level and the second-floor skywalks of what's known in Calgary as the Plus 15 network are locked. Merchants in the food court have long since closed down. The ground-floor atrium still looks tidy and filled with greenery, but no one is there to enjoy it.
This is more than a story about Calgary's weak economy, however. Behind the scenes, the tower has been the subject of a nasty legal battle over alleged contamination that has played out for well over a year. It pits the owners and landlord against the subsidiary of a Chinese state-owned oil company that last occupied it.
CNOOC Petroleum North America ULC vacated the premises last year, claiming it is laced with dangerous concentrations of asbestos and the landlord refused to properly get rid of the carcinogenic material. The company says that constitutes a breach of the lease and seeks damages of $70-million.
The building's owners, which include Ontario government pension plan OPTrust and a group of prominent Calgary investors, accuse CNOOC of vastly exaggerating the problem so it could break its long-term lease and snap up space in one of the city's premier office towers at a fraction of the cost.
Few punches are pulled in court documents: The owners point to CNOOC's past oil spills and fatalities in the oil sands as evidence of its own lax approach to safety and say Beijing is pulling the strings.
The case shines a new light on part of the city's ailing downtown core, where office vacancy rates are now as high as 27 per cent from the effects of a fiveyear oil industry downturn exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. To be sure, the Nexen building dispute has a sizable impact on the local economic crisis: The tower on the western side of downtown accounts for more than 5 per cent of the 11.5 million square feet of vacant office space in the core as reported by real estate firm CBRE.
"Due to the asbestos contamination, the building is not fit for occupancy as headquarters for a global energy company; it does not meet minimum regulatory standards, let alone the standards of a first-class office tower," CNOOC says in its statement of claim.
"Contrary to its obligations, the landlord has made it clear it will not fully remove the asbestos. Instead, the landlord seeks to manage the deteriorating asbestos fireproofing in place, minimizing any commercial impact on the landlord by imposing unacceptable health risks onto CNOOC's employees."
CNOOC filed suit in May, 2019, after the landlord went to court to seek a judge's ruling on whether there were grounds to break the lease. More than a year on, the legal to and fro continues. CNOOC submitted an amended claim this past May.
OPTrust and its partners, Centurion Holdings Ltd., Quantico Capital Corp., Westhills Land Corp., Canadian Income Fund Group Inc. and Tokay Capital Corp., have countersued. The partner firms are owned by such local business leaders as oil men Tony Vanden Brink and Kent MacIntyre and real estate investor Joseph Killi.
The group said, as landlord, it responded to CNOOC's concerns with extensive testing and a plan to address any problems within legal guidelines - that is, spot abatement where needed.
It said the testing revealed the asbestos fibre concentrations, discovered as part of the fireproofing in the 38-year-old tower, are minute and can be dealt with safely without evacuating the building. CNOOC is using the presence of asbestos as an excuse to bail on a lease that had more than a decade remaining after extensive layoffs that left many floors vacant, the owners charge.
"By the fall of 2017, CNOOC found that its premises were much larger than it needed, and that it remained committed to pay rental rates significantly higher than prevailing market rates. CNOOC set about trying to break its lease," the owner group said in its statement of defence.
CNOOC subsequently subleased space in the Bow, the curvy and swish landmark tower on the other side of downtown that has been the headquarters of Encana Corp. (now known as Ovintiv Inc. and headquartered in Denver) and Cenovus Energy Inc.
Angular and imposing, the 600,000-square-foot Nexen tower was built in 1982 as the corporate base of Nova Corp., the former pipeline and chemical conglomerate. Emblematic of the city's brash corporate ambitions at the time, the sign at the front entrance once proclaimed it proudly as Nova's "World Headquarters." The plaza in front has always been dominated by a silver block-like sculpture called Nova Gate, by the Russian-born artist Kosso Eloul. Nova was acquired by TransCanada Corp., now TC Energy, in 1998.
Oil producer Nexen Inc., which had previously been known as Canadian Occidental Petroleum, leased the building in 2000, and in 2013 Nexen was taken over by CNOOC Ltd. in a controversial US$15.1-billion deal that required approval by Ottawa because the buyer was a Chinese state-owned enterprise. At the time, opponents of prime minister Stephen Harper's government expressed concern about growing Chinese control over Alberta's oil sands. To help gain the approval, the company committed to maintaining employment levels.
CNOOC renegotiated the lease that year, when the average rent for top-tier space in Calgary was more than $40 a square foot. It is now less than $25, according to CBRE. CNOOC extended the lease to 2031. According to the landlords, the company had 2,300 employees and contractors working in the building at the time. By 2017, after an oil price collapse and operational difficulties at Nexen's Long Lake oil sands project in northern Alberta, the number had fallen to about 1,000.
Both sides agree the building has asbestos. Just how much, and what should be done about it, are in dispute.
CNOOC says it discovered the material in the fireproofing that coats the inside of the air distribution system in late 2017. Asbestos fibres, when released into the air in high enough concentrations, have been proven to cause such conditions as asbestosis and mesothelioma. As the fireproofing deteriorated, the contaminated dust collected on the ceiling tiles and wafted down to the work spaces below, presenting "grave danger" to staff, CNOOC said.
By the following July, CNOOC found 500 locations in the building with asbestos-contaminated debris. It said it was forced to vacate entire floors and close scores of offices and meeting rooms on floors that remained open. In its claim, CNOOC said it hired a consultant, Eco Abate, which conducted testing and concluded that the contaminated material was found throughout the building, the fireproofing had degraded in many areas and the tower should be evacuated to be remediated.
The company quoted provincial Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) rules stating that a building is unsafe if asbestos fibres may be released.
Meanwhile, studies by the landlord's own consultant, WSP Canada, also showed the fireproofing to be in fair to poor condition, and it recommended the materials be removed, CNOOC said.
CNOOC said it kept the landlord apprised of its concerns and by November, 2019, the owners implemented an asbestos management plan that included monitoring the degradation of the fireproofing and remediating any problems in place. But the company deemed the response insufficient and demanded more testing. By May, 2019, CNOOC, blaming the landlord's intransigence, terminated the lease and vacated the building, it said.
The owners tell a much different story. In its statement of defence, the group says it responded "quickly, diligently, and completely" to CNOOC's concerns with extensive testing and the development of a comprehensive plan to deal with the problem within the stipulations of the lease agreement and the law.
The landlord sought to work co-operatively with CNOOC but found the company to be "resistant and secretive." Despite what CNOOC claims, the owner group says its own consultant concluded that the asbestos was contained in a "cementitious, monokote-type" fireproofing product that was unlikely to release fibres. It said the material contained vermiculite from a mine in Libby, Mont., which had 0.1per-cent asbestos content.
CNOOC threatened to stop paying rent while abatement was taking place, the owners claim.
The oil company also said it would calculate how much rent money should be reimbursed while the company was unable to use several floors, according to the counterclaim.
The landlord began a pilot abatement program in the summer of 2018 that successfully rid an area of the building of asbestos, with CNOOC's consultant, Eco Abate, monitoring the work.
OHS reviewed the work and determined that abatement could be done safely in the occupied building, the landlord said.
But the owner group says CNOOC still appeared bent on tearing up its lease, using employee safety as an excuse. In its statement of defence, the group also shot a barb at the company by bringing up two recent incidents when CNOOC's own commitment to safety was called into question.
In 2019, the company was fined $450,000 in the deaths of two workers in an explosion at its Long Lake oil sands project. A year before, it paid a $750,000 fine after pleading guilty of federal and provincial environmental laws over a 2015 oil spill at Long Lake.
"After experiencing environmental spills and workplace fatalities for which it pleaded guilty to offences and was fined over a million dollars, CNOOC had nonetheless decided to try to avoid its lease obligations on a pretext of ‘safety,‘" they said. "By this action, it seeks to make the court part of that effort. The effort is without merit."
CNOOC declined to be interviewed for this story. In a statement to The Globe and Mail, the company said it sued its landlord after discovering asbestos during planned renovations. It said the legal action stems from its commitment to provide a safe environment for its staff. "The discovery of hazardous materials presented an unacceptable safety risk to our employees and resulted in management making a safety-first decision to relocate our population to a safer workspace," the company said.
A major question is how the two sides can have such divergent interpretations of the extensive testing that has been done. Blair Yorke-Slader, lawyer for the owner group, said numerous older buildings in Calgary, including schools, hospitals and office buildings, have been found to contain more asbestos than the Nexen tower and have workable removal processes in place.
He uses Foothills Medical Centre, a hospital in the city's northwest, as an example of a major structure with an active asbestos management plan.
Today, the landlord is trying to attract new tenants, but the glut of vacant office space because of chronic economic weakness, coupled with the pandemic, have made for a dearth of interested parties. Indeed, there are acres of available office space downtown and three other buildings have been reported to be empty. Meanwhile, the owner group is out about $500-million in terms of the present value of the remaining rent on CNOOC's lease, Mr. Yorke-Slader says.
"It seems to me that when you have a building where you've had hundreds, if not thousands, of tests conducted - this might be the most tested building in Alberta - and not a single test has revealed asbestos at a level that would be harmful to human health, then you can make some conclusions from that," he says.
A court date has yet to be set.

Full text: Small businesses operating in government-owned buildings say they're struggling to stay afloat because their landlords are ineligible for the federal-provincial rent relief program.
Ottawa, the provinces and territories announced the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance (CECRA) program in late April. The program offered to cover half of many small businesses' rent for three months if they paid a quarter and the landlord didn't charge for the final quarter. The program has drawn heavy criticism, particularly because the landlord must apply - leaving tenants powerless while giving some landlords huge amounts of paperwork for numerous tenants.
But Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp., which runs the program, says governments themselves are ineligible as landlords, leaving small-business owners who rent from government agencies frustrated that they're being left behind by a government-designed program.
"I'm trying to figure out what help the program is actually supposed to supply, if it's not helping small businesses," said Jordan Craig, president of the Performance Solutions special-effects and design company, which operates in a City of Toronto-owned building in the city's Port Lands.
His neighbour Shakir Omar, who runs the Keating Channel Pub & Grill, wonders why governments aren't talking to each other to solve their problem.
"We're the small businesses that all this was intended for, and you guys are the landlord - why can't you make it happen?" The restriction around government landlords is yet another constraint to the widely criticized CECRA program, affecting hundreds, if not thousands, of businesses countrywide.
Entrepreneurs want governments to revamp the program to better address their mounting rent burdens.
"This is another example of how the design of the program is working against helping business owners who need help in a way that is completely arbitrary and unfair," said Laura Jones, executive vicepresident of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business.
Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp.
says that although some governmentfunded institutions such as hospitals and universities can be CECRA-eligible landlords, the program was "designed to support property owners who are non-governmental entities."
"Where government is the property owner and has a direct lease with a tenant, then the government entity is best placed to work directly with its own tenants to provide rent relief under their leases without accessing CECRA," CMHC spokesman Leonard Catling said in an email.
"This avoids transfers of CECRA funding to other levels of government."
Despite this, federal Finance Ministry spokeswoman Maéva Proteau said late Thursday that small-business tenants in federally owned and Crown corporationowned buildings should be offered the same 75-per-cent rent reduction for April, May, June and July rents as CECRA.
"The government has decided that they, as well as Crown corporations, should provide rent reduction to their commercial tenants, in alignment with CECRA intent and core criteria," Ms. Proteau said in an e-mail.
It was not clear late Thursday whether or how this decision would be extended to provincially or municipally owned buildings.
Landlords can apply for CECRA on behalf of tenants who pay less than $50,000 in rent monthly, earn less than $20-million in gross annual revenue and have seen at least a 70-per-cent drop in revenue from the pandemic.
Mr. Craig and Mr. Omar's buildings are managed by CreateTO, a city agency overseeing Toronto's real estate assets. They were offered rent deferrals, but like many entrepreneurs across the country, would prefer to have their rent covered for the period that government-ordered shutdowns diminished their revenues - rather than simply owe more money later.
CreateTO spokeswoman Susan O'Neill said in an e-mail that despite the limitations that CECRA imposes, the agency is supporting its tenants in other ways, including by deferrals.
"We continue to work with our tenants and in some cases, rent relief has been extended beyond three months for those who need it," Ms. O'Neill said.
Very few small businesses or landlords have been satisfied with CECRA. Beyond neither group wanting the onus to be on landlords, CECRA was also announced and rolled out later in the pandemic than other programs.
And governments have had to both clarify and change eligibility requirements since CECRA's announcement after media outlets pointed out inconsistencies and roadblocks for entrepreneurs.
Mom-and-pop shops often have thin margins and high overhead costs, the biggest of which is usually rent. Many struggled to stay afloat during widespread economic shutdowns this winter and spring.
Even as revenues began inching upward as provinces gradually reopened, physical distancing and other safety measures have prevented income from reaching normal levels.
The Sushi Eben-Ezer restaurant in Maple Ridge, B.C., was only able to reopen in late June, and was offered a rent repayment plan by its landlord - the City of Maple Ridge. But owner Sally Kang says she's struggling to figure out how to repay several months' rent when business is slow.
"It's worse than before," she said.
Her husband, James McDevitt, said that when CECRA was announced, it felt like "we won the lottery. And when we found out we're not qualified, it felt like it was taken away from us."
He and Ms. Kang have since launched a petition asking the federal government for more flexibility with the program.
The mayor of the Lower Mainland city, Mike Morden, said he was among Ms. Kang's supporters hoping the federal government would modify the program.
"Our hope was that the spotlight on this topic here in our community, and in communities across the country, would have resulted in a modification of the program for, minimally, local governments who would have to fund any support programs with local tax dollars," Mr. Morden said in an e-mail.

Full text: THE LISTING Real estate startup Justo Inc. is getting a funding assist from a group of investors that includes all-star Toronto Maple Leafs forward Mitch Marner.
For Mr. Marner, who turned 23 in May and signed a six-year US$65.358-million NHL contract prior to the 2019-20 season, the equity investment is about planning for the future.
"Hockey is not going to last forever. For me, it was just seeing an opportunity here and seeing something I think is really going to blow up," Mr. Marner said about his first venture investment. "This is what I'm really looking forward to doing, and get more involved with ... it's gotta be the right companies and the right picks."
Justo, founded in 2017, is a real estate brokerage focused on the greater Toronto market with a couple twists on the traditional ways of doing business in Ontario: Its 10-person sales staff aren't paid through commission, and the commissions the brokerage charges are discounted. The company won't disclose the other investors in the group or the exact amount they have raised other than to say the total investment is in the single-digit millions.
Robert Reichmann, also an investor in Justo who has served as the startup's chief development officer since July of last year, said the company needs the money to boost its sales staff, marketing presence and digital infrastructure.
"Housing prices have doubled and commissions have stayed the same, there's no good reason for it," Mr. Reichmann said.
"Our game plan is very much to disrupt the Canadian market in a significant way ... we're in our second year of active operations and have done $200-million in volume." (Volume is not revenue - it's a measure of the value of the homes bought or sold with Justo agents, on which Justo takes a small slice.)
Justo's key pitch is that people who buy a house with one of its agents gets cash back in the form of half of the traditional buyer-agent commission. Selling and buying agents typically split commissions in Ontario, and in the Toronto region those fees vary: Where 5 per cent (split evenly) is typical, some agents offer more or less in commission. For sellers working with Justo, the commission is 1.25 per cent. So far, the company has handed back close to $2million in cash to its clients.
Brokerages that give clients a discount on commissions typically offer less service to clients, but Mr. Reichmann says Justo is still a full-service brokerage on a slimmer commission and even offers extras such as free home inspections for buyer clients and free 3-D tours for sellers.
"Another thing that really sparked our mind - why we thought it was a really good fit - is that they told us they would donate a minimum of $100 [to Mr. Marner's charity] for every home sold through the brokerage ... that's for a minimum of three years," Mr. Marner said. "It felt like a company that's not just an investment deal, it feels like a family deal in that you can be really close with everyone in the community and help everyone." Mr. Marner's charity, the Marner Assist Fund, has in the past run hockey tournaments for young people (cancelled this year owing to the pandemic) and has recently been helping to provide meals to front-line health care workers.
Mr. Marner, who was born in Markham, Ont., and grew up in Thornhill, says his father - a former realtor - has always stressed the potential of real estate. "Still to this day, his thing to me is always real estate, and land will never go down in money," he said. So far, Mr. Marner has bought a cottage and a house, a personal experience in paying high commissions that convinces him Justo's approach will have legs.
Mr. Reichmann also has a deep family history in real estate: His grandfather was Albert Reichmann, one of the five brothers who came to Canada and the United States after the Second World War to build up Olympia and York Developments into an international property empire. It went bankrupt in the 1990s. In addition to founding Consequential - an investment firm focused on real estate innovators - Robert Reichmann is president of Reichmann Rothschild, a family office that manages private equity deals and philanthropic giving.
"We are not one of these unrealistic ridiculous tech startup companies; I take pride in the fact we are down to earth and realistic," said Mr. Reichmann, who approached Mr. Marner initially through his management agency. "We're not looking for dumb money, I was very happy with the reception to what we were up to and what we were doing. I don't think [Mr. Marner] is making investments like this on a typical basis. I'm very excited about it. ... I don't want to question it too much."
It's somewhat unusual for young athletes to be focused on a posthockey career and portfolio, but Mr. Marner credits his former teammates for getting him thinking about his financial future.
"I remember Patty [Patrick Marleau] was always telling me about markets and watching stocks and all this stuff," he said.
"His thing was ... obviously there's going to be a day where you don't play hockey any more, and you gotta make sure that when that happens you can still run your life without going down the drain; you gotta make sure you're ready to have backup plans that will help you out.
"Another [influence] was my parents, they were really big on that ... of making sure that you build yourself a brand that when you're done the hockey you can hop out of it and still work and still be successful."
As the pandemic continues, leaving the interrupted NHL season in limbo, posthockey planning seems like the head's up play.

Full text: Sunflower Farm, 165 Concession Rd. 5 SUNDERLAND, ONT.
Asking Price: $2,999,999 Taxes: $12,773.33 (2019) Lot Size: 160 acres Agent: Hannah Math Slan, Harvey Kalles Real Estate Ltd.
THE BACKSTORY In 2005, Florence Minz purchased 100 acres of undulating farmland north of Toronto and began making plans to build a country house. Ms. Minz conferred with architects and explored the potential for building an environmentally friendly dwelling that would make use of the latest green technologies.
During that process, a parcel came up for sale directly to the south. That property offered 60 acres of scenic countryside - and an existing circa 1870 farmhouse.
The yellow-brick Victorian provided a lovely vista toward the rolling hills on the land she already owned.
"You get a wonderful view with that 100 acres," Ms. Minz says.
Ms. Minz learned that only four families had owned the farm over the years. She decided to acquire the property and refurbish the century home.
The farm had become incredibly rundown under the most recent owner Ms. Minz says, but she admired the layout and such Victorian details as the contrasting brick inlay and gingerbread trim.
The lady who owned it had also been a wonderful gardener.
"Nevertheless, I was a little delusional," Ms. Minz says.
She figured she could cart away the quirky assortment of plastic swans and other collectibles that filled many of the rooms, then freshen up the interior with lots of paint.
But when Ms. Minz decided to replace an ill-suited addition, the engineers discovered that the entire structure was unsound. The wood trim on the porch was rotting and a couple of the farm's outbuildings were dilapidated.
"My original idea of just painting was not on," she says.
THE HOUSE TODAY With a more ambitious project ahead of her, Ms. Minz brought in the prominent heritage architect Gordon Ridgely.
"What I loved about Gordon's work is he created a real sense of comfort," Ms. Minz says.
She also knew he would respect the provenance of the original house.
She recalls seeing Mr. Ridgely standing for hours in front of the house as he contemplated where to place the garage.
Their collaboration would last four years - until Ms. Minz moved in in the summer of 2009.
Today, the five-bedroom house has two additions, which are artfully hidden so that the original house appears little changed from the front. Ms. Minz installed geothermal heating and cooling, and the interior was completely revamped by the architect.
"The way he reorganized the floor plan was amazing," she says of the 5,000 square feet of living space. "It's really a new house."
The original staircase at the front of the house was removed, for example, and an elevator was installed. Mr. Ridgely designed a new stairwell with a skylight framed in copper above.
In the expansive new west wing, Mr. Ridgely created a large kitchen with a vaulted, beamed ceiling and a lounging area around the two-sided fieldstone fireplace.
Ms. Minz enlisted the help of a trained chef to design the kitchen so that she can provide meals for a crowd. At Thanksgiving, for example, Ms. Minz's annual celebrations include up to 70 people.
The main floor also includes a living room, dining room, family room and a private home office with views over the landscape.
Mr. Ridgely was very talented, she says, and that meant he could also be very bossy. The only area where they disagreed was in choosing some of the materials.
But Ms. Minz knew what she needed in order to create a restful retreat.
Throughout the interior, Ms. Minz used reclaimed wood floors and heritage paint colours. For the bathrooms, she chose pale grey marble.
"The house is very comfortable," she says. "There were places where he wanted more formality, but it's a country house." Upstairs, the master suite has a luxurious bathroom and a bedroom with vaulted ceilings and doors opening to a deck. There are four more bedrooms on that level.
For the exterior, Mr. Ridgely was able to find bricks to match the original colours at a brickyard in Toronto, and Ms. Minz found a local bricklayer who skillfully matched the century-old methods.
Tucked behind the house, a large deck made from Brazilian hardwood provides a peaceful place for al fresco dining or gazing at the pond.
Ms. Minz has spent many years working to improve the landscape at the 160-acre property she christened Sunflower Farm.
Cornfields were replaced with red clover in order to nourish the soil. There are pear and apple orchards and a 5,000-square-foot organic produce garden.
"I wanted to encourage birds and butterflies," Ms. Minz says. "I don't use pesticides anywhere."
The property has a spring-fed pond and waterfall, perennial gardens and stands of mature trees. Landscape architect Neil Turnbull nestled a root cellar with a green roof into the contours of a rock garden.
A stone silo draped in vines stands near the vegetable garden and a horse barn is fitted with beautiful stables, Ms. Minz says.
"There are a lot of places that somebody could ride right on the property."
For additional rusticity, there's a circa-1800s log cabin, which the third owners acquired in upstate New York and transported to the farm on a flatbed truck.
It takes a little more than one hour to drive from Toronto to the tranquility of the farm and surrounding countryside, Ms. Minz says.
"By the time you're halfway through your drive, you've started to relax. It's not on the cocktail circuit - that's not what I wanted. I wanted a place to really get away."
THE BEST FEATURE The farm provides serenity in all four seasons, Ms. Minz says.
With so much organic produce coming from the garden in summer, Ms. Minz has vegetables preserved and stored in glass jars with the Sunflower Farm label.
Those become her favourite host and hostess gifts in the winter months, she says.
Winter visitors can ski or snowshoe or just stay cozy in front of the wood-burning fireplace.
Every October, pumpkins from the fields are made into pies for the Thanksgiving festivities.
"It's beautiful in the fall," Ms. Minz says. "I've had really wonderful times."

Full text: 273 Glen Manor Dr. E.
TORONTO Asking Price: $6.25-million Taxes: N/A Lot Size: 93 feet by 135 feet (irregular lot) Agent: Shea Warrington, Royal LePage Estate Realty THE BACKSTORY The stately stone home for sale in the Beaches on the winding Glen Manor Drive turns out to have a deep connection to Hogtown history, deeper even than the owner knew.
In 2012, John Sterling, co-founder of investment fund ROI Capital, bought the house from Bay Street impresario and former Dragon's Den star Michael Wekerle.
"I lived in the Beach before-hand, and I remember saying ‘I want to buy that house,' " Mr. Sterling said. "The biggest charm in the whole house was the stonework.
You don't see a lot of stone houses in the Beach."
Mr. Sterling had been told the house had a connection to R.C.
Harris, famed Toronto city-builder behind the Bloor Viaduct and the eponymous R.C. Harris Filtration Plant, an art deco Beaches landmark immortalized in Michael Ondaatje's 1987 book In the Skin of a Lion.
Rather, it appears the house was built in 1924 for a different Harris (not believed to be related), Joseph Henry (Joe) Harris who would become one of the city's more prominent citizens, growing a family-owned meatpacking empire while also serving as a member of Parliament from 1921 until his death in 1952. The W.
Harris & Co., from its Strachan Avenue abattoir and headquarters, would begin consolidating the meat-processing business that put the Hog in this town's nickname with a series of mergers in 1927. The new entity, named Canada Packers, would grow into one of Canada's largest food companies, eventually evolving into the Maple Leaf Foods Canadians know today.
Mr. Harris was a life-long Conservative, and the house is also small-c conservative in its scale.
It's on the corner of Glen Manor Drive and Pine Glen Road, and overlooks the footbridge that connects the east and west side of Glen Manor over the Glen Stewart Ravine, and the lot is expansive for a Beaches property (95 feet on the ravine side). Successive updates across the decades have blended the home's heritage character with modern amenities and uses, not least of which is the pool in the backyard. A few years back, Mr. Sterling had the slope that runs up the side and front lots completely relandscaped, transforming it from a mix of brush and scrub to a manicured garden that is serviced twice a week.
Listing agent Shea Warrington said that even before the house officially went on the market, there had already been a few showings for Beaches locals who, like Mr. Sterling, have long admired the house from the street. "A house of this calibre already has a fair bit of interest," she said. "I find many buyers right now want to expand their space - people working from home, kids not going to university. Travel is unlikely in the near future. Creating your own private ‘resort destination' is appealing.
Not that the Glen Manor price point is in everyone's snack bracket." THE HOUSE TODAY The front door and driveway is on Pine Glen. The arched front door leads into a reception hall at the centre of the house. To the right is the formal dining room with coffered ceiling, to the left (past the stairs that wind to the second level) is what might once have been a library but is now a cigar room. To the left of this and one step down is a sunroom that is one of Mr. Sterling's favourites in the house.
"That's where I read the paper in the morning," he said. "Or if I come home after work, and I feel like a drink ... it's got good light, it looks out on the pool."
There is a doorway to the rear yard and its expansive patios, views into the ravine, a barrelshaped standalone sauna, and a secluded al-fresco dining area.
Back inside, from the reception hall there is a large rounded archway to the central family room on the back of the house, with sitting areas, a TV, fireplace, easy access to the kitchen and many windows into the backyard. This is your classic mid-century family room, even if Mr. Sterling and his children don't use it nearly as much as they do other entertainment spaces in the house.
The kitchen, accessible from the dining room and family room, is all updated and wide open, with a big marble-counter island in the middle and an eat-in nook tucked into the lead-paned bay window facing the backyard. Just next to the kitchen is the mudroom, which accesses the backyard and the garage.
Mr. Sterling barely changed the main floor, but he did some extensive work in the basement and upstairs. The basement has a spare bedroom with a stone fireplace, a custom-built, climatecontrolled wine-cellar, even a nook for a pinball machine ... but the show-stopper is a theatre room with three-tiers of platformed seating. He had one at his previous house, he has one at his cottage and he needed one here, too.
"I like a theatre room ... it's not like I watch tons of TV, but after dinner with a glass of wine, it's great," he said.
Lately, he's been catching up on Netflix documentaries and the classics. "I'd never seen Romancing the Stone [the 1984 jungle romcom featuring Michael Douglas, Kathleen Turner and Danny DeVito]. We enjoyed watching that."
The second floor was not changed too dramatically either,
though there are a few surprises.
There are five bedrooms: Two have walk-in closets and are connected by a jack-and-jill walkthrough semi-ensuite bathroom, one that is currently an office and has no closet, and a standalone bedroom with no walk-in (there's a separate four-piece bath on this level, too) and the master suite. In the master, the lockable walk-in closet is concealed behind some built-in cabinets, and there's a five-piece ensuite bathroom. This floor has one more secret: a door that looks as if it could be a linen closet but that actually leads to the third level.
This is the most unusual space in the house: What was just an attic is now a huge vaulted room filled with sky-lights, exposed stone and nooks tucked into dormers. "I built a bar, and was thinking I would have people over for football ... well that never happened," he admits. Among the current uses, it's Mr. Sterling's gym ("I don't like working out in basements") with his Peloton machine. It once had a karaoke machine and disco ball for his daughter (heading to university soon) and his son plays a lot of Xbox on the TV tucked into a nook in the far side of the room. There's a full bathroom with shower up there, and it could be a teenager's dream room, or just the party room.
NEXT CHAPTER Mr. Sterling sold his company five years ago and is planning to move into a converted church in Toronto's Summerhill neighbourhood.
His passion these days is Saulter Street Brewery, which he opened in Riverside.
He's decided that the old Harris mansion is just too big. Other than his bedroom, he really only uses four rooms in the house - kitchen, sunroom, theatre and gym attic - and would like something a little more modest in scale.
It's been the home of Toronto business leaders since its creation and, priced in the $6-million bracket, it's likely that another tycoon will take it on. Ms. Warrington hopes it will be someone with a family looking to add to the house's long legacy.

Full text: Home sales in Montreal and Quebec City spiked to record highs in June, two more major cities that have seen real estate rebound and boom quickly after the novel coronavirus pandemic slashed activity in April. But economists don't expect the national home-buying frenzy to last while the economic recovery remains uncertain and unemployment high.
Last month, 4,980 homes sold in Montreal, a 16-per-cent increase over June, 2019, while 924 residential properties sold in Quebec City, a 47-per-cent gain over last year, according to the Quebec Professional Association of Real Estate Brokers. Sales volumes set a record for June in both cities.
The recovery in home sales is also strong in other major cities - including Toronto, Vancouver and Ottawa - that were showing signs of overheating before the pandemic spread in March.
But economists predict the furious pace will not last.
"This catch-up phase might run for another month or two, but we expect high unemployment will restrain demand thereafter," said Robert Hogue, senior economist with Royal Bank of Canada.
In the Toronto region, the biggest real estate market in the country, sales volumes last month almost matched June of last year, while the average home price climbed 12 per cent year over year. In the Vancouver area, Canada's most expensive market, sales rose 18 per cent year over year. In Ottawa, sales were similar to June, 2019, and the average selling price of a house was up 15 per cent.
Even in Calgary, which has shouldered two oil price crashes over the past seven years, sales recovered to prepandemic levels.
Meanwhile, Toronto suburbs and other cities in Southern Ontario reported strong sales, in part because of increased demand from Torontonians searching outside the city for more space, according to local realtors.
The median selling price in Montreal rose by 12 per cent for houses and 17 per cent for condos, year over year. In Quebec City, the median selling price climbed 2 per cent for houses, but fell 6 per cent for condos, according to the association.
Across most major real estate markets, a lower volume of properties for sale has spurred bidding wars and price inflation. One realtor called buyers who have not lost work during the pandemic "brazen" with their willingness to take out mortgages and make purchases.
Benjamin Tal, the deputy chief economist with Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, said June was the delayed spring buying season, which is typically the busiest time of the year for real estate transactions. But this year's April and May sales were weak after governments restricted many sectors of the economy to stop the spread of the virus.
"You cannot sustain this kind of activity," Mr. Tal said. "The real test is going to be the winter, the possibility of a second wave [of coronavirus cases] and increased economic uncertainty, and increased in duration of unemployment, more permanent job loss - that's when we might see the market softening," he said.
Since mid-March, millions of Canadian residents have lost work and income because of the pandemic. In the interim, the federal government and banks have provided a buffer to the economic hardship.
Ottawa has extended its Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) for individuals. The $2,000 in taxable income a month can be tapped for a maximum total payout of $12,000.
As well, banks have deferred mortgage payments for about 15 per cent of their residential loan portfolios and recently extended the deadline for mortgage deferral applications.
"The expiry of mortgage payment deferrals and the possible phasing out of government support programs, including CERB, later this year could prompt more people to sell their property," RBC's Mr. Hogue said. "Any material rise in supply could lead to price declines in some markets down the road."

Full text: Toronto home sales rebounded in June, with the average selling price up 12 per cent over the past year, as competition heated up after a brief slowdown from the coronavirus pandemic.
Once again, properties across the Toronto region are fetching multiple offers and bids well over asking prices. Ultralow mortgage rates, a shortage of properties for sale and strong demand is leading to bidding wars and higher prices.
Home buyers were forced to put their purchases on hold when the COVID-19 pandemic hit in March. Now that Ontario and Toronto are starting to allow more businesses to reopen and are easing restrictions, buyers have started to pounce.
"Before the onset of COVID-19, there was a great deal of pent-up demand in the market. This pent-up demand arguably increased further over the past three months," Lisa Patel, president of the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board, said in a statement accompanying the results.
Other cities that had robust sales before the pandemic also saw strong recoveries last month. Vancouver sales were higher than June of last year and prices rose by 3.5 per cent, according to its home price index, an industry calculation of a typical home price.
In Ottawa, sales were essentially flat on a year-over-year basis in June, but the average selling price rose by 17 per cent for condos and 15 per cent for houses.
In the Toronto region, sales and prices have rebounded to pre-COVID-19 levels.
The largest residential market in the country saw 8,701 homes sold in June, up 84 per cent on a seasonally adjusted basis from the previous month and a similar volume of sales compared with June, 2019, according to the board.
Although new listings increased 2 per cent year over year, the number of active listings was about one-third less than June of last year.
The average selling price across all types of homes in the Toronto region rose 12 per cent to $930,869, compared with the same month last year.
Toronto realtors have described a hectic market where certain properties attract about 100 private showings or sell within days of being listed. According to data on online brokerage HouseSigma.com, some semi-detached houses have fetched between $300,000 and $450,000 more than the asking price.
Steven Green, a realtor with Royal LePage, said two of his clients' homes sold in less than a week: A condo sold in one day and a house drew multiple offers the first day it was listed.
"Almost everywhere in the greater Toronto area is more competitive for buyers," said Mr. Green, who has worked as a realtor in the area for more than three decades.
That competition is reflected in the price inflation. In the city of Toronto, the average selling price of a detached house climbed 14 per cent to $1,523,770 in June, and a semi-detached house jumped 22 per cent to $1,287,832, according to the board.
The average selling price of townhouses and condos rose about 6 per cent over June of last year.
In the surrounding suburbs and nearby cities, prices also surged, in part because of demand from Torontonians looking for more space, according to local realtors. In the parts of the Greater Toronto Area surrounding the city, the average selling price for a detached house rose 12 per cent to $1,027,634 and a semi-detached house increased by 9 per cent to $752,808.
As a result, the board said its price forecast for the year could exceed its initial estimate of an average sale price of $900,000 for the Toronto region. However, the board lowered its annual sales forecast to 80,000 homes from the previous outlook of 97,000 sales, because of the 10-week slowdown that started mid-March.
After the province stopped non-essential work mid-March, sales slowed considerably in April and prices remained flat. Before the pandemic, the average selling price across all properties in the Toronto region was increasing by double digits. In April and May, sales were considerably lower than last year, although prices held steady in the first full month of the pandemic and started rising again in May.
The rebound in June does not mean it will hold until the end of the year. The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. has predicted national home prices will decline and reach a low next year, after loan deferrals arranged during the pandemic are due to expire.
Banks have deferred mortgage payments for about 15 per cent of their residential loan portfolios. The deferrals last for up to six months and many mortgage holders are due to resume payments in the fall. If homeowners cannot do that, they may be forced to sell their properties, which could add more supply and depress prices.

Hong Kong's immigration offices have been deluged - and the exodus is likely just beginning

Full text: One young registered nurse is preparing to leave Hong Kong and take a pay cut as a home support worker in Canada. A kindergarten teacher in the Asian financial centre is getting ready to take a job as a Canadian live-in nanny. And one of the city's private bankers is so determined to leave that he has seriously considered becoming a pig farmer on the other side of the Pacific.
Across Hong Kong, the offices of immigration consultants have swelled with people seeking to depart since Beijing said in late May that it would impose national-security legislation on a city whose streets have frequently become battlegrounds for protest and violent conflict over the past year.
Many, consultants say, want to come to Canada, in a new echo of past moments of crisis that led large numbers of people to leave Hong Kong for Vancouver and Toronto. An estimated 300,000 people with Canadian passports currently live in the city, a testament to the close ties established over the past three decades.
This time, however, fear is driven by national-security legislation that, after its imposition this week, allows Beijing to define what constitutes secession, subversion, terrorism or foreign interference.
It is legislation that Chinese authorities say is needed to restore stability, but that critics say blurs the boundary between the authoritarian mainland and a city that has cherished freedoms akin to those in Western democracies.
The day Chinese authorities said they would impose the legislation, May 21, was the busiest day immigration consultant Andrew Lo can recall in more than three decades. "Everybody is panicked. We even have clients calling to say, ‘Can you help me move tomorrow?' " By his staff's count, the number of immigration companies advertising their services in the city has swelled to nearly 200 from just more than a dozen 13 months ago.
That number will only increase after Hong Kong police arrested residents on Wednesday over protest signs and chants that contravene the sweeping law.
Interest in immigration began to increase last summer, after the Hong Kong government introduced an extradition bill that raised fears local residents could be sent to China to face justice in courts under the control of the Communist Party. That bill was later withdrawn, but not before months of protests, some violent, began to snarl the city.
The national-security legislation, which criminalizes a wide range of conduct - from legislative filibusters to "Liberate Hong Kong" chants - has added new impetus.
Chinese authorities have said they will protect freedom of speech and assembly. In Hong Kong, critics question Beijing's commitment to upholding liberties that are sharply curtailed in mainland China.
In normal times, people interested in emigrating from Hong Kong might be 45 years old to 55 years old, said Jean-François Harvey, a Canadian lawyer who is worldwide managing partner for Harvey Law Group, which specializes in immigration and taxation. "Now it's 18 to 80," said Mr. Harvey, who is so busy that he just doubled his office space and staff retinue.
That includes young graduates groomed for success in a city that has grown rich bridging mainland China with the outside world: people who speak Cantonese, Mandarin and English.
"They just want to leave this place," said Alisha Ma, a licensed immigration consultant who is the founder of Halcyon Counsel.
"They don't feel safe here.
They don't want to bring up their children here. And their parents are asking them to leave." Some of those are contemplating leaving good jobs in Hong Kong for smaller salaries and less professional security abroad - including the teacher and the nurse looking at lower-paying work in Canada.
Ms. Ma can't escape a feeling of sadness as she watches people enter her door, knowing that they are intent on leaving, and taking with them valuable skills.
One recent client was a mid-level manager fluent in four languages and rapidly progressing in her career.
"Every country would like to have that person," Ms. Ma said.
"And Hong Kong is losing her."
"It's very emotional to see the change," she added. "It's very sudden. And it's not subtle."
Exact current statistics are difficult to obtain. But the Hong Kong police issue certificates of no criminal conviction to people applying for visas or immigration.
Those figures show an 8-percent increase in the first five months of 2020, despite the pandemic and the widespread interruptions to international travel.
In March, the number of applicants was up nearly 40 per cent over 2019.
One of Mr. Lo's clients, a private banker, was so eager to leave after the announcement of the national-security law that he latched on to a pilot agri-food immigration program to Canada that promises residency for people qualified to work as butchers, ranchers and farmers. "I said, ‘Are you serious?' " recalled Mr. Lo, the founder of immigration company Anlex.
"He said, ‘I'm serious. Because I just want to go.' " Mr. Lo eventually talked the man out of it.
Canada continues to rank among the most desired destinations for people seeking to leave Hong Kong, alongside Australia and Ireland.
But those are hardly the only choices. Unlike the years between the Tiananmen massacre in 1989 and the 1997 handover to China, when people in Hong Kong had few options, numerous countries now have policies that provide residency to investors and home buyers. Bulgaria, Greece, Malaysia, Montenegro, Thailand and Turkey have all become potential destinations.
Immigration lawyer François Mandeville has been approached by consultants from Ireland, Portugal and Germany, looking for qualified people. They see Hong Kong "as a very good source of immigrants," said Mr. Mandeville, the founder and managing partner of Mandeville & Associates.
"It's a centre of wealth, and also it's a centre of knowledge."
In past moments of exodus from Hong Kong, people left because they were uncertain about what the future would hold.
"Nowadays, it's not that they don't know about the future. It's that they don't like the future," Mr. Mandeville said. To many, Hong Kong looks as if it will "become more and more like a Chinese city," he said.
Others have said their fear is not China, but the U.S. response to Beijing's actions. When U.S.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo threatened sanctions against Hong Kong, wealthy residents suddenly began to worry that their economic well-being could be affected.
"Politics is one thing. But when this has a direct impact on their assets, then those people say, ‘now it's getting serious,' " Mr. Harvey said.
For those eyeing Canada, meanwhile, the most attractive destinations remain Vancouver and Toronto. In Vancouver, real estate agents seen an increase in queries from Hong Kong.
"We have seen a noticeable uptick in interest and that's while travel is still severely restricted and the economy is still locked down from COVID-19," said Macdonald Real Estate Group president Dan Scarrow.
But a small minority of people looking to leave Hong Kong have grown so displeased with China's treatment of the city that they are looking for options outside major centres.
Roughly one in 10 people say they want to "go where there are not many Chinese, especially mainland Chinese," Ms. Ma said.
"Psychologically, they want to avoid that oppression - and anything to do with Mandarin."

A new plan to tackle the housing problem

Full text: Compared with the normally sluggish pace of most construction projects, the development of two new City of Toronto affordable housing complexes will have a kind of don'tblink-or-you'll-miss-it quality.
The projects - one in the west end and the other in Scarborough, and both designed by Montgomery Sisam Architects (MSA) - will have 56 and 44 units respectively. Each 250-squarefoot studio contains a single main room, a kitchen and a bathroom, and is intended as housing for a currently homeless individual.
Their most distinctive feature, however, is mainly invisible: Both are being built using "modular construction" techniques, with each apartment unit assembled entirely in a Grimsby, Ont., factory, transported to Toronto and craned into place like so many Lego blocks. From site preparation to occupancy this fall, they'll each take about four months to complete, says Daniel Ling, a principal and director with MSA. A similar undertaking using conventional construction methods would drag on for 12 to 18 months, he adds. "It's a very significant time savings."
While these proposals, which received a green light from Toronto council this week, have been the target of some NIMBY grumbling, they're also drawing attention to the potential for modular and prefab development in a city where construction sites, with all their familiar disruptions, can persist for years.
But besides speed, proponents of this approach also point to other benefits, including improved energy performance, smaller carbon footprints, reduced cost and more consistent quality control.
Countries such as India, China and Finland have shifted their construction sectors to far greater reliance on prefabricated building components, while in Hong Kong, local authorities won't issue a building permit to developers who can't demonstrate that some elements of their proposed projects are factory built, according to University of Alberta professor of construction engineering Mohamed AlHussein, who has advised on prefab apartments that were completed in weeks.
In British Columbia, provincially funded affordable housing projects are now mandated to use modular design; indeed, Mr. Ling says the two Toronto projects rely heavily on designs that have been tested in 30 such apartments, several built by Calgary-based Horizon North, a modular manufacturer.
The domestic market for factory-made components has not only grown sharply in the past decade, but is attracting new entrants. The number of certified producers in Canada jumped from 85 to 147 between 2009 and 2020, while 36 importers - mostly American and Chinese - now sell into the Canadian market, according to data compiled by the Canadian Home Building Association (CHBA).
One Alberta homebuilder, Landmark, now produces all of its dwellings in an automated 150,000-sq.-ft. Lethbridge factory owned by ACQBuilt. The London, Ont.-based construction giant Ellis-Don is in the midst of constructing a 300,000-sq.-ft. factory in Hamilton that will pump out steel-frame prefabricated modules.
Meanwhile, Element5, a fiveyear-old mass timber startup armed with $10-million in venture capital backing from Kensington Capital Partners, is building a 120,000-sq.-ft. plant in St.
Thomas, Ont. Using automated production equipment supplied by Ledinek, a Latvian firm, Element5 will turn out engineered beams and wall assemblies from wood processed in a pair of Northern Ontario saw mills, founder Patrick Chouniard says.
"We're in this revolution in the construction industry."
The revolution has been notably slow to start. In contrast to the global manufacturing sector, which shifted aggressively to justin-time supply chains and automation three decades ago, the Canadian construction sector has been sluggish to modernize, with the result that projects are delayed because of perennial scheduling conflicts involving skilled trades, subcontractors and municipal inspectors.
But in recent years, says Kathleen Maynard, CHBA senior director for building innovation, worsening labour shortages among electricians, plumbers and carpenters have forced construction companies to turn to prefabricated components, from retrofitted shipping containers to roof assemblies and completely framed wall panels fitted out with doors, windows, insulation and exterior cladding.
The shift to factory-made elements typically means safer working conditions and less waste.
Prof. Al-Hussein's research has also shown substantial reductions in not only idle time, but also wasted drywall, cardboard and other building materials.
The result, Mr. Chouinard says, is that construction costs can come in 5 per cent to 20 per cent lower than conventionally built structures. "The motivation for the developer is that they can build it cheaper and faster."
While early demand for prefab units typically came from builders of cookie-cutter single-family homes, Ms. Maynard says more than 80 per cent of the production now finds its way into affordable housing, apartment buildings and offices. Mr. Chouinard's firm is one of several aiming to tap into demand for mid-rise post-and-beam office buildings made from engineered wood.
"That's the sweet spot," he says.
LGA principal Janna Levitt, whose firm designed Stackt Market, a shipping container complex in downtown Toronto, also points international examples, including boutique hotels, student residences and all-wood apartment buildings, as proof that modular structures are becoming less utilitarian and more suitable for innovative design.
LGA is currently working on a small prefab arts and recreation facility situated in the middle of an Etobicoke park. The project, Maple Arts, is linked to a nearby affordable housing complex. Ms. Levitt says the motivation was to erect the small building without overrunning a busy park with construction equipment.
As for the two Toronto affordable housing sites, the approvals process was sharply accelerated after a spate of COVID-19 outbreaks in homeless shelters forced the city to scramble to find alternatives.
With construction crews set to begin building the foundations and elevator shafts in the next few weeks, skilled trades at the Grimbsy plant will start erecting the 100 units, which will be hauled on flatbed trucks to Toronto later in the summer. "Everything is installed in the shop," says Mr. Ling, the architect. Once they're lowered into place, the landscape will be completed and the apartments turned over to the new occupants. "It's pretty simple and straightforward."

Full text: A British safety company is expanding further into Canada with the acquisition of a software company that allows businesses to manage and vet contractors.
The purchase of Toronto-based ContractorCheck is the second Canadian acquisition for Cardiff-based Alcumus Group Ltd. in less than a year.
Alcumus, whose customers include major real estate developer Canary Wharf Group PLC, made its first foray into North America last year with a $40-million investment in a Toronto software company called eCompliance.
This latest purchase will allow Alcumus to tap businesses that use contractors, such as construction companies. ContractorCheck says their software accredits contractors and helps businesses reduce risk by allowing them to "access real time contractor information to ensure the health and safety" of their workers.
Alcumus declined to say how much it paid for ContractorCheck. The acquisition would make up less than one-10th of its overall business and help round out its workplace safety services in North America, according to its local president.
Alcumus, which said it has more than 40,000 clients globally, said North America was the largest and "highest growth" area in the world.
Alcumus said its software has helped modernize workplace safety by digitizing compliance, accreditation and safety checks, which companies have done using spreading spreadsheets and paper forms.
Other Alcumus clients include homebuilder Mattamy Homes and miner Kirkland Lake Gold Inc.

Full text: Vancouver has become a draw for major institutional investors seeking to invest in the city's real estate market, and increasingly, the way in is to partner with local developers, industry experts say.
Institutional investors are companies that invest money on behalf of clients, such as hedge funds, pension funds, mutual funds, insurers or real estate investment trusts (REITs), and typically seek real estate holdings in robust urban markets.
With its growing job market, low vacancy rate with high rents and resilient real estate market, Vancouver is becoming increasingly attractive to big investment.
"The bigger institutions all want to own more in Vancouver," says Jason Kiselbach, senior vice-president and managing director for brokerage company CBRE Vancouver. "If you can find willing owners of properties here, there is no shortage of capital partners."
He says investors want their portfolios spread across Vancouver, Toronto, Montreal and Calgary, but most of them have not hit their target for Vancouver.
Real estate is also seen as a safe harbour, particularly after COVID-19 struck and the stock market showed its volatility. Mr. Kiselbach and others saw a bump up in institutional interest at the start of the pandemic. And Vancouver prices so far have held strong. But in the Metro Vancouver market, large-scale opportunities are fewer because the market is smaller and local private ownership groups tightly hold a lot of it, Mr. Kiselbach says.
"As a result, I think some of [the investors] have found a potential solution in just partnering with some of the local owners who already have decent opportunities. [These developers] own the properties, they don't want to dispose of them, but they don't mind spreading the risk around and taking on a partner to develop the project."
Allied REIT, which specializes in office properties, has made it a goal to add significant Vancouver real estate to its portfolio, according to a press release the company issued in April.
The company has partnered with Vancouver-based developer Westbank Corp., best known for its high-profile residential projects on several mixed-use developments, including the distinctive new 24-storey tower in downtown Vancouver at 400 W.
Georgia St., which is Deloitte's new headquarters. Apple Inc.
and co-working company Spaces are also tenants.
The tower, currently under construction, is across the street from Amazon.com Inc.'s future office space at the former Canada Post building, a 1.13-millionsquare-foot redevelopment called the Post that is key to the city's emerging tech industry sector. Allied has also purchased the commercial heritage building the Landing, located in Vancouver's Gastown neighbourhood.
Once the Westbank building is complete, that will bring the REIT's Vancouver property holdings to 820,000 square feet, Allied president Michael Emory said in the release.
Vancouver's mid-size developer PC Urban Properties Corp., which develops all types of properties, entered into its first partnership with a major institutional investor when it recently closed a deal to purchase a 9.7acre industrial property with Toronto-based private equity real estate investment firm KingSett Capital. The Richmond property, Viking Way Business Centre, is fully occupied, but the owners have plans for redevelopment, to be announced this fall.
It is PC Urban's largest acquisition to date, according to chief executive officer Brent Sawchyn.
In a press release, KingSett cited PC Urban's experience for redeveloping industrial properties, and the developer called the partnership a "natural progression of the company's growth."
Mr. Sawchyn also cited the City of Richmond's vacancy rate of less than 1 per cent. The developer and KingSett declined a request to comment further on the partnership.
Mr. Kiselbach, who was not involved in the Richmond deal, says there can be sensitivity around these financial arrangements.
"A lot of people are nervous about being out there too much, I guess, talking about the secret sauce," he says with a laugh.
"They don't want to clue too many people into their strategies."
But Mr. Kiselbach expects Toronto-based companies such as KingSett and Crestpoint Real Estate Investment Ltd., as well as the Blackstone Group, a multinational private investment management company based in New York, will continue to make further moves into the Lower Mainland, looking for more lucrative partnerships. It puts a new spin on foreign buying. Last year, Blackstone purchased 80 per cent of the downtown Bentall complex with Los Angeles-based Hudson Pacific Properties, which owns the remainder. Hudson Pacific manages the four towers, which recently became the headquarters for Canadian tech success story Shopify Inc.
"What's happened is that more of the big institutions from Toronto and even the U.S. have seen the fundamentals in Vancouver over the past five years.
We are a growing city and we have more positive immigration happening. That's leading to tech companies coming here and improving the labour market - it's like a snowball effect," Mr. Kiselbach says. "That's created this growing demand from the bigger institutional players."
But not all partnerships are suitable, he adds.
Vancouver-based Cressey Development Group has a large portfolio of rentals, but for the most part, the family-run company has chosen to maintain full control of those particular assets, says Tom Johnston, vice-president of asset management.
"When you have partnerships in assets that make returns over a long period, you set yourself up for when one partner may need to exit for whatever reason," he says.
Mr. Kiselbach says that a few local developers who've been approached by institutional buyers have turned down the offers because the developers want to remain nimble and not have to get approval to close a deal. But for small- to mid-size developers, a partner can get them the growth that would be unattainable otherwise.
"They are in that mid-tier group and want to scale up and find opportunities. Sometimes [a partnership] is a way for [the developers] to say, ‘I've got assets in Vancouver. You have some in Toronto. I want exposure to that market. Maybe we can go back and forth with this a little bit.' " Developer Zack Ross, chief operations officer of the Vancouver-based Cape Group, focuses on the residential rental sector, and he is also seeing increasing interest from Toronto investment companies.
"They are looking outside of Toronto [to] diversify," Mr. Ross says. "Vancouver is obviously a very attractive market, and people want to live here, which has led to some of the money coming out here.
"We have a strong rental market and I think that is where the money will be focused. I have had discussions with a few larger funds that are looking. I don't have anything lined up with them, but there is definitely interest in Vancouver."

Full text: Travel accommodation provider Sonder Holdings Inc. has raised US$170-million in venture capital funding despite a severe downturn in the hospitality industry after the Montreal-born rival to Airbnb took quick action early in the pandemic to protect its business.
The company, one of the most highly valued startups to launch from Canada in the past decade, is poised to emerge from the pandemic in a stronger position than many of its rivals that offer managed shortterm accommodations - including Stay Alfred and Airbnb-funded Lyric Hospitality, Zeus Living and Oyo Homes and Hotels - but have either suspended operations or severely retrenched.
Sonder, which had about 5,000 units available for guests in North America and Europe as of February, began planning for the worst that month as the novel coronavirus hit Asia and Europe.
In March, it cut or furloughed about a third of its 1,200-plus employees, slashed costs, sought rent relief from landlords and slowed its pace of expansion. It also shifted its strategy to offer extended stays to health care workers, displaced students and stranded travellers at discounted rates, rather than marketing short stays to business and vacation travellers.
As a result, Sonder says occupancy is now about 75 per cent. That's 31 percentage points above the industry average in the week ended June 20, according to industry research firm STR.
Sonder chief executive Francis Davidson "basically went from a peacetime CEO growing his company like crazy to a wartime CEO making sure we'll be ahead of the curve once we come out of this, not knowing when we're going to come out [or] how deep we'll have to go," said Chris Arsenault, partner with Montreal's Inovia Capital, which co-led the financing with other previous Sonder backers Fidelity and WestCap.
"The company is an outperformer."
Sonder, which moved to San Francisco from Montreal in 2016, is now valued at US$1.3-billion, meaning investors pegged the company's worth at roughly the same level as when it last raised venture capital in 2019.
By contrast, Zeus, a smaller competitor, took a reported 50-per-cent cut in valuation when it raised US$15-million in May.
The Globe and Mail first reported in April that Sonder had raised about half of a targeted US$150-million to US$200-million financing. Sonder said Wednesday it expects to raise another US$30-million to reach US$200-million.
"We're incredibly proud to have been able to raise this much capital from this high-quality investor group at ... a very compelling valuation," Sonder chief financial officer Sanjay Banker said. "To do that for a travel business during the pandemic ... is a real testament" to Sonder's quick response to the crisis.
Mr. Davidson launched the company in 2012 after his freshman year at McGill University, renting his Montreal apartment to travellers to earn extra money. The next summer, the Gatineau native managed vacant apartments for other students; by 2014 he was generating $1-million in revenue and quit school.
Sonder's growth plan differed from Airbnb as it leased its units directly from real estate companies, giving it more control over spaces and furnishings. (Sonder does advertise listings on Airbnb's platform.) It targeted digitally savvy millennials seeking "authentic" experiences rather than generic hotels or the uneven quality of Airbnb accommodations.
Forgoing costly amenities such as room service, front desks and gyms, it provided keyless entry to rooms appointed like hip boutique hotels, scattered in buildings in cosmopolitan neighbourhoods. Sonder instead offered "digital concierge" services to guests through their phones, connecting them digitally to local services such as food delivery.
In 2018, Sonder stepped up expansion efforts, leasing more than 1,000 rooms a quarter, and attracted copycat rivals. By the end of last year it was generating US$260million in annualized revenue and taking over management of boutique hotels.
While Sonder has weathered the sharp downturn better than the rest of the industry, Mr. Davidson said in April he anticipates a "difficult and deep and long recession," but he added "this might be one of the best opportunities" to add properties.

Full text: Alberta's government-owned investment fund parted company this week with executives responsible for a $2.1-billion loss on trades linked to market volatility, as its board of directors completes an audit and brings in an outside leader.
Alberta Investment Management Corp., known as AIMCo, oversees $119-billion on behalf of 31 clients, including pension plans for health care workers and police officers and the Heritage Savings Trust Fund.
In an e-mail to clients on Wednesday, chief executive Kevin Uebelein said executive vicepresident of public equities Peter Pontikes "is no longer employed with AIMCo."
Separately, AIMCo said portfolio manager David Triska, who ran the volatility-based strategies, also left the Edmontonbased fund manager.
AIMCo did not tell its clients why Mr. Pontikes left after spending 19 years at the Edmonton-based fund manager and the Alberta government, and a spokesperson declined to comment on the two executives' departures.
Mr. Pontikes was AIMCo's third-highest paid employee last year, earning $1.93-million.
Sources who work with AIMCo and its clients said the two former executives were directly responsible for the fund manager's recent losses on derivativesbased investments tied to market volatility. The Globe and Mail agreed to keep the sources' identities confidential because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.
As The Globe first reported, AIMCo's public equities portfolio included a strategy that essentially bet against sharp swings in stock prices, an approach that made modest returns in recent years, but resulted in significant losses when the global pandemic sent markets on a roller-coaster ride in late March. In April, AIMCo decided to wind down the investments, a process that took until mid-June.
In early April, AIMCo executives told clients the fund manager did not fully understand the risks they were taking on volatility-linked investments. In a press release at the end of April, Mr. Uebelein said the performance "is not acceptable" and said: "Anytime you are counting in the billions, it is a big number worthy of attention, and I certainly would never want to experience such an outcome from a strategy."
In mid-May, AIMCo's board announced it hired senior partners in KPMG's financial risk management team to provide an independent review of the fund manager's investment and risk management processes. The board said KPMG would provide a report by mid-June. In addition, former Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan chief risk officer Barbara Zvan volunteered to review the fund manager's operation, and her report was also scheduled to be delivered last week. On Wednesday, an AIMCo spokesperson said the board expected to release the reports to clients and the Alberta government by the end of the month.
Last week, AIMCo announced former Canada Pension Plan Investment Board CEO Mark Wiseman will become the fund manager's chair on July 1, after former Enbridge chief financial officer Richard Bird finishes a three-year term. Mr. Wiseman was terminated in December from his previous job as global head of active equities at BlackRock Inc., which oversees US$7trillion, for violating the New York-based fund manager's code of conduct by failing to report a relationship with a co-worker.
Public filings from AIMCo clients show the fund manager was one of Canada's worst-performing pension plans in the first three months of 2020, and has consistently missed performance benchmarks.
The $3-billion Special Forces Pension Plan for police officers, an AIMCo client, reported in early June that its fund was down 12.2 per cent in the first quarter of this year, compared with a 6.7-per-cent decline in their benchmark. AIMCo posted a 10.2-per-cent loss on a $50-billion portfolio belonging to its largest client, a fund for health care and municipal workers called the Local Authorities Pension Plan or LAPP. The average Canadian pension plan lost 8.7 per cent of its value in the first three months of this year, according to consulting firm Mercer.
In addition to losses on volatility-linked strategies, filings from clients show AIMCo turned in poor results in the first three months of the year in stock, bonds, real estate and private equity investments. Last year, LAPP said AIMCo's results fell short of the pension plan's value-added expectations for 46 consecutive quarters, or 11 years and six months.
AIMCo employees are among the best-paid government workers in Alberta: Its CEO and chief investment officer made $3.4million and $3.6-million, respectively, last year.
Alberta's governing United Conservative Party announced plans last fall to move an $18billion retirement fund for the province's teachers under the AIMCo umbrella next year, a move the teachers' unions opposes. Alberta Premier Jason Kenney has also raised the idea of moving Alberta's contributions to the Canada Pension Plan into AIMCo.

Full text: When Mark Zuckerberg hosted a town hall in late May with Facebook Inc.'s 48,000 employees, some were tuning in from new cities they had scrambled to move to as the pandemic hit.
Mr. Zuckerberg had a clear message for them: If you plan to stay, expect a change to your pay.
"That means if you live in a location where the cost of living is dramatically lower, or the cost of labour is lower, then salaries do tend to be somewhat lower in those places," he said on the video conference, where he announced more employees would be allowed to work remotely permanently.
Mr. Zuckerberg gave Canadian and American workers until Jan. 1, 2021, to inform the company about their location, so it can properly complete taxes and accounting and use virtual private network checks to confirm staff are where they claim.
The demand is part of a new reality Canadian workers are being confronted with as employers try to quell the spread of COVID-19 and increasingly consider making remote work permanent.
The shift means many companies are having to rethink salaries and compensation, while grappling with the logistics of a new work model.
Only one-third of Canadians working remotely expect to resume working from the office as consistently as they did prepandemic, while one in five say they will remain primarily at home, according to a June study from the Angus Reid Institute.
Like Facebook, Canadian technology companies Shopify Inc. and Open Text Corp. have already announced more employees will soon have the option to permanently work remotely.
Both declined interviews with The Canadian Press, but Richard Leblanc, a professor of governance, law and ethics at York University, said he wouldn't be surprised if their staff that relocate will see their pay change.
"It's inevitable because the cost and expense structure of work has changed," he said.
"If you, for example decide, that you could do the majority of your work from well outside the Greater Toronto Area ... and you want to buy a home in Guelph or in Hamilton, should we expect the base salary for those individuals might change?
Yes, because your cost of living has changed and your expenses have changed."
If companies calculate salaries properly, neither the business nor workers should feel their salary adjustments are unfair, Prof. Leblanc said.
However, figuring out what to pay staff transitioning to permanent remote work is tough, especially with a pandemic raging on and forcing some businesses to lay off workers or keep companies closed.
Owners have to consider what salaries will help them retain talent, but also how their costs will change if workers are at home.
Companies, for example, may be able to slash real estate costs because they don't need as much - or any - office space, but may now have to cover higher taxes, pay for their workers to buy desks or supplies for their homes or offer a budget for them to use on renting spaces to meet clients.
"[Businesses] are looking at every line item on their income statement ... because they want to make sure they can survive and thrive over the long-term," said Jean McClellan, a partner at PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP's Canadian consulting practice.
Companies such as GitLab, an all-remote company in San Francisco focused on tools for software developers, may offer some clues about how Canadian companies opting for permanent remote work can tackle salaries.
When GitLab started offering permanent remote work years ago it built a compensation calculator combining a worker's role and seniority with a rent index that correlates local market salaries with rent prices in the area.
Anyone can visit GitLab's site and plug in a role, experience level and location to find a salary.
GitLab's junior data engineers, for example, make between $50,936 and $68,913 if they live in Whitehorse, Yellowknife or Iqaluit, where the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation said the average rents for a two-bedroom home last October were $1,695, $1,100 and $2,678 respectively.
That salary shoots up to anywhere from $74,359 to $100,603 for those living in Toronto, Vancouver or Victoria, where CMHC reported the average rents for a two-bedroom home last October were $1,562, $1,748 and $1,448 respectively.
Prof. Leblanc warned that varying remote work salaries can create "a global competition for talent in an online world."
People who apply for permanent remote jobs, he said, may find they're fighting for the role against far more people than ever before because companies will be able to source talent living anywhere in the world.
The companies that don't offer remote work at all could also find themselves at a disadvantage, if their industry starts to value flexibility and look less favourably at companies that don't offer it.
GitLab settled on its model and calculator because the company said they offer transparency and eliminate biases around race, gender or disabilities.
Its co-founder Sid Sijbrandij wrote in a blog that the calculator was dreamed up because every time he hired someone, there was a conversation around reasonable compensation.
The negotiation would usually revolve around what the person made beforehand, which was dependent on what city they were in. Gitlab scrapped that model in favour of the calculator and also started letting workers know if they move their salary could change.
However, GitLab acknowledges that many people see paying someone less for the same work in the same role regardless of where they live as "harsh." The company disagrees.
"We can't remain consistent if we make exceptions to the policy and allow someone to make greater than local competitive rate for the same work others in that region are doing (or will be hired to do)," it says.
"We realize we might lose a few good people over this pay policy, but being fair to all team members is not negotiable."

Despite COVID-19, Ottawa market roars ahead

Full text: Natalie Sauve gets emotional talking about her childhood home. It's about 20 minutes from Ottawa's downtown on a cul-de-sac with a pool and a big backyard that backs onto a park, just steps from a school.
She had hoped she would raise her own children in the house some day.
But when it as time for Ms. Sauve's mother, Liliane, to move, they decided to test the market.
Immediately, they realized the offers were too good to pass up.
After a coat of paint and some minor repairs, the home went on the market on May 21. Five days later, it sold. There were 61 showings and 18 offers - all over asking. The accepted deal was $92,000 over the list price of $514,900.
"It's insane," says Geoff Walker of Re/Max Absolute Walker Realty, the listing agent for the elder Ms. Sauve's property.
Even as other major markets such as Vancouver and Toronto have begun to bounce back after the pandemic's devastation, Ottawa has led the pack. Average prices for homes in May, according to the Ottawa Real Estate Board, jumped 11.2 per cent year over year. Condo prices have gone up 15.5 per cent over the same time frame. The year-todate average sale prices for homes and condos in the city has gone up 13.8 per cent and 17.8 per cent, respectively.
Mr. Walker has worked in Ottawa for 19 years. He says this is the first time he's seen such a lack of balance in the marketplace, driving places such as Ms. Sauve's - which, despite her nostalgic connection, is a fairly run-of-the-mill three-bedroom, three-bathroom home, he says - to price points that were previously unheard of.
There is excessive demand in Ottawa, Mr. Walker says, and it's creating a multiple-offer environment. He says he's seen more homeowners invest money into their own property and stay in their homes instead of trying to buy. Two sellers of his, he says, were on the market and then decided to take their properties off for fear of selling, but then not being able to buy another home.
"Selling is not the issue," he explains, "finding the correct home [to buy] is."
According to the Real Estate Investment Network's COVID-19 special real estate cycle update report, all major real estate markets in British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario are in a steady decline because of the economic impact of the pandemic shutdown, except for one: Ottawa.
Analysts say the resilience of Ottawa's real estate market has much to do with the makeup of the local economy. Ottawa's job market is dominated by sectors less affected by the pandemic, including the public service, technology, health care and education. Ottawa-Gatineau's jobless rate increased from less than 5 per cent earlier this year to approximately 7 per cent in May.
But even at that, it is still the third-lowest jobless rate of any major metropolitan area in the country, according to Statistics Canada.
Deb Burgoyne, the president of the Ottawa Real Estate Board, was critical of the Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corp.'s recent forecast for Canada's housing prices, declaring them "pretty bleak."
The CMHC's broad-based analysis for the country as a whole does not reflect what is transpiring in Ottawa, she says.
"All we can say with confidence is that your house will sell," Ms. Burgoyne says, pointing to recent figures from the OREB that show more than 90 per cent of all recent sales are going into multiple offers and above list price.
"[CHMC] has got to put it into perspective. Ottawa, for over three years, has been in this feeding frenzy and we had a supply problem before we went into this.
We were geared up for a very strong market."
Mr. Walker says Ottawa's market is out of sync, in terms of supply and demand.
The long-time agent says the current market is unhealthy, but he's hopeful for a resurgence of inventory to help balance it out, especially as Ottawa's economy shows no sign or letting up.
While the numbers show homes in the Ottawa area are costing more, the process to find a home has become a bit easier, according to recent house hunter Matt Harris.
Mr. Harris, a radio producer, and his partner had been casually pondering the idea of buying a home when they found themselves expecting their first child.
With a baby on the way, the search was on, and fast.
With a budget of about $600,000, Mr. Harris says they put in an offer on a detached home, about 25 minutes east of Ottawa's downtown, without stepping foot in it.
"There was always a ‘but' with the other places we looked at, but we found this place that ticked all the boxes. As much as it's not the same as going in to view a home and see it, you get a sense on the virtual tours," says Mr. Harris, who nonetheless insisted on seeing the house in person before signing the deal.
Buying was easy, Mr. Harris says. Moving has been the hard, with the long lineups and restrictions at supply stores complicating the process.
"Buying a house ‘virtually' in Ottawa was easier than shopping for moving supplies," he says.
While Mr. Harris seemed to have sailed through his home buying experience, Ms. Sauve found the pace of the action somewhat more exhilarating.
"Our house went straight from ‘Coming Soon' to ‘Sold,' " Ms. Sauve says. "It was a little closer to chaos."

Full text: 18 Fallingbrook Rd.
TORONTO Asking price: $2.65-million Selling price: $2.8-million Taxes: $9,681 (2019) Lot Size: 50 feet by 122 feet Agents: Shea Warrington, Royal LePage Estate Realty THE BACKSTORY The home at 18 Fallingbrook Rd.
was built in 1852, but has been owned by just two families since 1933. When the house was remodelled in 2007, the current owners wanted to make sure the sweep of that history remained intact.
"We see people coming in and tearing down an old house and building a great brick and stone mansion - to me, it doesn't fit in The Beaches," Shelby Leeder said.
That's why she kept cedar shakes on the exterior and tried to keep the scale of the remodel modest.
"We didn't want a new home ... I wanted to nod to the character of the Beach. We're across the road from the water, we have lake views, we walk to the water every day when we had a dog three times a day. There's something a little East Coast about it. I think the McMansions don't relate to that at all."
Ms. Leeder sold her first house in The Beaches while she was on honeymoon in Martha's Vinyard with her husband in 1991. The couple hadn't yet landed on a new house, but upon their return to Canada saw a newspaper advertisement for a rental house on Fallingbrook Road. "Character home for rent in the beaches," Ms. Leeder said. "We thought, we'll take a chance and have a look.
"It was a very odd home. We understand it evolved that way organically. It had all sorts of doorways in and out and it was tiny. The landing for the main staircase entered into the bathroom and you had to go through it to the bedrooms."
The structure had started out as a coach house, then a hiredman's house for a nearby estate.
But for 60 years, it was owned by Marcus and Jean Ageney. Their son, Chris, was managing the property when the Leeders came along. In 1993, he agreed to sell them the house outright.
Along with the house, Ms. Leeder took possession of some of Jean Ageney's writings and clippings from local news coverage. In one letter, Ageney describes "our house" as they first found it in 1928 (the Ageneys had also rented the house before agreeing to purchase it).
"The house sat in its garden as if it had grown there," the letter reads. "This part of the city has neither proximity to the business centre nor the approval of society to recommend it, but artists, and people who love the water, parents who want healthy children and old men who like to grow flowers in their gardens, live there." Much of that remains true today, though "society" has more approval of the area now; it's one of the most desirable districts in the city.
Prior to Ms. Ageney, one of the previous owners was an architect, Norman Robinson, who was the subject of Canadian artist Charles Comfort's portrait The Dreamer.
Ms. Ageney was so interested in her home's history that she struck up a correspondence with Mr. Comfort, who had gone on to serve as a director of The National Gallery of Canada in the early sixties and was awarded the Order of Canada in 1972.
Buyers got wind that 18 Fallingbrook was coming to market and the house has been sold even before it was properly listed. "Right now, homes have become more important than ever," listing agent Shea Warrington said this week. She said she has already sold seven houses during the pandemic. Prospective clients cal her, looking to trade up from simple "living space" to a "home base."
"There have been people who maybe have lived conservatively, and are facing two people working from home for a long time. A big new-build with a home office and a home gym is a lot more relevant now."
THE HOUSE TODAY From the street, you can see how renovations have maintained the house's distinctive oddities. The chimney on the front of the house is an unusual sight and the walkway through the landscaped front garden to the covered front porch takes you past the front room to the entryway.
Inside the foyer is a powder room and a short hallway leading to the rear of the house. On the left side of the hallway are two doors into the original sitting room and dining room, preserved to reflect the tastes of the Ageneys. The wide cedar planks on the walls, stained a rich red, and the original brick fireplace pull you backward in time.
"It's a great place for long chats when we get the fire roaring and it's also our Christmas room," Ms. Leeder said. "That room informed every other decision, including the siding and beams in the new parts, the reclaimed barn-board elm floors. We took references from that space and tried to blur the lines between old and new and make it seamless."
The furnishings match the cedar, even the trim on the windows and the shutters match.
This is the core of the house and the 2007 additions wrap around it. The stairs leading upstairs are at the back of the dining room, next to double doors that lead directly into the kitchen. A door on the left under the stairs takes you into the butler's pantry that runs between the garage past
the mudroom into the kitchen.
"It's my command post," Ms. Leeder says of the new kitchen.
"It's been designed so that you can see in every direction what's going on in the house. If you've got kids, it's a nice thing to have. I love to cook so it's my dream kitchen because I don't feel like I'm in the back corner of the house somewhere."
The kitchen is central, with a sunny breakfast room with windows on three walls off to the left.
Behind that is the mudroom with entrances to the attached garage and a side door. This is truly a room designed for mud, with a dog shower in the corner and a Dutch door connecting to the house: vital for beach-loving fourlegged sand-magnets to rinse and dry off in comfort. On the other side of the kitchen is a living room with a television and fireplace to the right (just beside that is the stairs to the expanded basement).
The wainscotting and beams throughout this space are in a similarly knotty cedar as the original sitting room to tie them together.
At the top of the stairs is the first of four bedrooms (one is currently a home office). The 13-footby-16-foot bedroom with windows facing the street has a walkthrough closet to the semi-ensuite bathroom. The second bedroom is just next to this bathroom, and is a more modest 10 feet by 16 feet. On the other side of the staircase is the laundry room, across from the office with its walkout to a balcony deck facing the backyard. The backyard is terraced, with a huge patio sitting area and a secondary patio up the terraced hillside toward the back of the lot.
The master suite occupies the remaining two-thirds of the rear portion of the house, featuring his and hers walk-in closets and spacious ensuite bathroom with standalone claw-foot soaker tub and separate shower, alongside two pedestal sinks and vanity.
THE BEST FEATURE The house has a lot of praiseworthy features, but what drew the Leeders to it when it was a ramshackle affair and kept them there for decades was the neighbourhood.
Fallingbrook is one of those Toronto districts filled with lore and local legend. In the late 1800s, it was a playground for railroad barons and other wealthy Torontonians. It sits between the art deco palace of the R.C. Harris Water Treatment Plant and the Toronto Hunt Club, and remains one of the few areas in the city that features homes with private lake access. At the end of the street was once a public beach access known as the One Hundred Stairs (closed for more than a decade) that crawled precariously down the Scarborough Bluffs to the beach and from the 1920s a waterside dance hall named Fallingbrook Pavilion. It had another name: The Bucket of Blood (thanks to semi-frequent brawls), and Chris Ageney regaled the Leeders with tales of his youth, riding the small radial railway installed to supply the pavilion, hanging out at the dance hall and on the beach (which also had a boat launch).
The hall burned down in the 1960s, but Fallingbrook still draws the wealthy looking for a connection to the lake.

Airbnb bookings picking up again in Vancouver

Full text: Short-term rental bookings are starting to climb from the lows of the pandemic shutdowns, potentially shifting the picture for long-term renters in British Columbia's near-zero-vacancy cities and its vacation communities.
Many housing advocates and tourist cities here and elsewhere had seen the collapse of Airbnb-type bookings in March and April as a sign of potential relief for renters in the Lower Mainland's near zerovacancy rental market hoping those shortterm units will be converted to housing and for communities fearing travelling vacationers during a pandemic.
But that relief appears to be diminishing.
"A number of Airbnbs have transitioned to long term for the moment. But I suspect now we're going to have a lot of people out of their home," said Vancouver Councillor Pete Fry, who had a motion before council this week calling for new rules for shortterm rentals because of the pandemic. (It was deferred to a later meeting.)
He also said that the residential-tenancy board could end up being overwhelmed with complaints, as short-term rental operators try to evict those people they rented to for longer terms as they see the shortterm market coming back.
New bookings for short-term rentals in Vancouver have grown from a low of 535 for the week ending April 20 to 1,047 for the May 25 week, according to data provided to The Globe and Mail by airdna.co, a private company that tracks bookings and revenues for short-term rentals around the world.
That trend is also showing up for B.C.
and the country as a whole, as well as the U.S. The airdna.co website shows that bookings in Canada have grown from a low of 18,000 for the April 6 report to 48,000 in the June 1 report, which was posted this week. It was 61,000 in the first week of February.
On top of that, the world's prime shortterm vacation rental platform, Airbnb, is announcing a new initiative to promote and facilitate rentals that are within an easy drive of people's permanent homes, because that's what surveys show potential vacationers are looking for.
"Airbnb ... launched Go Near, a new initiative to support economic growth through local travel," said a news release from the company Thursday. "In a survey commissioned by Airbnb, nearly half of US respondents said they'll prefer to stay within a day's drive for their first trip once lockdown restrictions lift. Since the pandemic began, the percentage of bookings made on Airbnb within 200 miles, a round trip travelers can generally complete on one tank of gas, has grown from one-third in February to over half in May."
All of that is adding more complexity to what many say is a very muddled and potentially concerning picture in B.C. about the future of both vacation rentals and long-term rentals.
Vancouver-area landlords have been reporting very slight rises in vacancy rates in the last month.
It's not the only factor, though. Landlords and property managers say there are many dynamics at play, with many of them being impossible to assess at the moment.
"The biggest wild card is what's going to happen with international students in the fall. They take up a lot of units," said Nick Marini, who oversees rentals for about 2,500 investor-owned units on behalf of Macdonald Property Management.
Some are wondering whether the turmoil in Hong Kong will lead to more demand for housing here and more pressure on the rental market as a result. "Vancouver is a special case, because it has the flow from Asia," said Professor Ken Rosen, the chair of the Berkeley Haas Fisher Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics in California.
On the other side of the housing-demand picture, Prof. Rosen expects that many cities, especially San Francisco and likely Vancouver, will see some younger people move away to the suburbs because they won't need to work in a downtown office.

Full text: TORONTO As Ontario moves ahead with cautious plans to reopen the province's economy and ease restrictions keeping people at home during the coronavirus pandemic, some residents of the Greater Toronto Area are looking north to the pristine lakes and tranquil forests of cottage country for a safe haven.
In Muskoka, Paul Crammond of Chestnut Park Real Estate Ltd.
says he is hearing from city dwellers who want to ride out the summer of 2020 surrounded by shimmering blue water.
"No one's going to Europe this year. No one's going to Walt Disney World. All of the kids' camps are closed," Mr. Crammond says.
"There is definitely an urgency to this activity. Everyone wants a closing by the first of July."
April was a quiet month, says Mr. Crammond, who received a handful of calls from opportunistic buyers who thought they might snag a deal from cottage owners facing financial hardship.
But that mindset began to change as the lockdown across the province was extended, schools remained closed and people realized they would not have the opportunity to travel outside of Canada any time soon.
Heading into the second week of May, the thinking suddenly became, "let's get a cottage and let's get one now," Mr. Crammond says.
All price segments sprang to life in the Muskoka area, where entry-level cottages sell above $1million and family compounds on the "big three" lakes of Joseph, Rosseau and Muskoka can fetch $10-million or more.
One property sold firm for about $5.7-million in May, Mr. Crammond says, and another sold conditionally for more than $11-million.
In some cases, cottage sellers are receiving competing offers.
"People want move-in ready and they're willing to bid for it."
The burst of activity is a surprise to Mr. Crammond, who expected the slump that hit Toronto real estate in March to extend to cottage country. A vacation home is a luxury and a discretionary purchase, he points out.
"With the dramatic slowdown in the Toronto market, it was a natural assumption that Muskoka would slow down as well," he says.
And just as city buyers think it's a good time to own a vacation property, cottage owners who might have listed are staying through the summer, Mr. Crammond says.
"A lot of people who were thinking about selling are holding off."
That shortage of inventory is keeping prices steady with sale prices in 2019, he says.
Meanwhile, agents have to work around restrictions on driving and showings.
Some cottage owners are refusing interior showings the first go-round, Mr. Crammond says.
The potential buyer is invited to visit the property and walk around the exterior of the cottage.
If the buyer is serious about moving forward, only then is an interior showing permitted - and only for the actual buyers.
"This is not the time to bring kids and grandparents and interior decorators," Mr. Crammond says.
He adds that it's also not the time to do a "Muskoka 101" tour to become acquainted with the area. From March through until mid-May, government leaders from the Premier down to local mayors were urging city residents not to drive to cottage country while only essential travel was permitted. "Logically you could argue that it's not essential for you to buy a cottage," Mr. Crammond says.
Anita Latner of Anita Latner Realty Inc. says showing cottages during the time of COVID-19 comes with added complications.
"It's a very delicate dance," she says. "You don't want anyone getting sick on your watch."
She has some snowbird clients who are currently living in their cottages after spending the winter south of the border. She says some of those owners may hold onto their cottages longer than planned because they may not feel ready to travel to Florida and other parts of the United States next winter.
She adds that the tight market has kept prices firm but she believes some sellers are too optimistic.
"I think some of the pricing is way out of whack. Some people think they can ask whatever they want and they're going to get it - and that's not necessarily going to happen." She expects that lenders will be more conservative about lending money to cottage buyers and allowing homeowners to draw on the equity in their home in the city in order to buy a vacation property.
For her part, when Ms. Latner is representing a seller, she asks for a deposit of at least 10 per cent from a buyer.
"If you can't come up with 10 per cent for a cottage, you probably shouldn't even be looking," she says.
Ms. Latner says inquiries about rentals have also surged in recent weeks but cottages book up months in advance.
"It's too late in the season - even if we weren't in the middle of a pandemic," she says.
A little to the east in the Haliburton area, the market became "insane" about three weeks ago after two gloomy months, says Jeff Strano, a real estate agent with Re/Max Professionals North.
That region is also seeing scant inventory and an increasing number of buyers. Mr. Strano says some Toronto-area condo dwellers who typically take two or three vacations a year appear to be reassessing their priorities.
Some are looking for a waterfront cottage to provide a weekend escape on some of the area's most popular lakes, which include Kashagawigamog, Haliburton, Kennisis and Redstone.
Other potential buyers are looking to make a more permanent move to a year-round residence away from the density of cities and suburbs.
Mr. Strano says non-waterfront residential listings in the Haliburton region have fallen 52 per cent for the year to date compared with the same period in 2019 while sales for that category have dropped 49 per cent this year compared with the same period in 2019.
Waterfront listings in the area have dropped 39 per cent so far in 2020 compared with the same period last year. Sales have fallen 59 per cent year-to-date compared with the same period in 2019.
Meanwhile, Mr. Strano says, the median sale price for a home that's not on the water has risen 6 per cent to $292,500. The median price for a waterfront home has risen 4 per cent from this time last year to $517,500.
As cottage country heats up, some city dwellers fear being shut out this year.
"It's very, very hard on buyers," he says, as they watch their buying power erode when competing buyers bid up prices. "Some of our buyers are losing a little bit of hope. They just can't afford to play the game."
Mr. Strano says his office is requiring buyers and sellers to sign declarations and follow protocols designed to keep everyone safe.
"The tire kickers just disappear," he says of the practice.
The buyers that remain are committed, he adds.
"This could be, oddly enough, one of our best years ever - which back in March and April was hard to imagine."

AIMCo's risky strategy led to higher losses than most pension plans

Full text: Alberta's government-owned fund manager confirmed significant investment losses on Wednesday, adding fuel to a heated debate over Premier Jason Kenney's plan to shift more of the province's retirement savings into its care.
The Alberta Investment Management Corp., known as AIMCo, took a 10.2-per-cent loss in the first three months of the year on a $50-billion portfolio belonging to the largest of its 31 clients, a fund for health care and municipal workers called the Local Authorities Pension Plan, or LAPP.
AIMCo also invests the Heritage Savings Trust Fund, a provincial war chest funded by royalties on oil and gas companies.
This was the first public release of overall performance at AIMCo.
The loss came when industry data show the median return for Canadian pension plans in this period, which includes the COVID-19 induced market selloff in late March, was a 7-per-cent decline.
Another AIMCo client, the $3billion Special Forces Pension Plan for police officers, reported on Wednesday that their fund was down 12.2 per cent in the first quarter, compared with a 6.7-per-cent decline in their benchmark.
A significant portion of AIMCo's decline reflected investments linked to market volatility. The Edmonton-based fund manager previously estimated it will lose a total of $2.1-billion on this strategy, on total assets of $119-billion.
But figures released on Wednesday show the fund manager turned in poor results in stock, bonds, real estate and private equity.
"The volatility strategy was an unfortunate situation that has had plenty of attention, but these numbers do confirm that AIMCo has underperformed compared to benchmarks across virtually all of the asset categories in which they invest for us," LAPP chief executive Chris Brown said in an interview. LAPP's own results were tempered by a "downside protection" strategy it employed on its own, which counteracted the losses by $1.9-billion.
It assured its members that the plan remains well funded and their retirement savings are safe.
Last year, LAPP said AIMCo's results fell short of the pension plan's value-added expectations for 46 consecutive quarters, or 11 years and 6 months.
AIMCo CEO Kevin Uebelein said the Crown corporation felt the "extreme pain" experienced by all investors.
"We actively reviewed and recalibrated our strategies to limit losses and have openly communicated with our clients through this challenging quarter," he said in a statement. "Meanwhile, we've already seen global markets rebound from their first quarter lows." AIMCo employs a diversification strategy, but it proved to be less beneficial when all asset classes suffered at the same time, spokesman Denes Nemeth said.
AIMCo's performance is a significant political issue for Alberta's governing United Conservative Party, which announced plans last fall to move an $18-billion retirement fund for the province's teachers under the AIMCo umbrella next year, a move the teachers' unions opposes. In a press release on Tuesday, the Alberta Teachers' Association said: "The Alberta teachers' pension fund would be worth $1.3 billion less today if it had been managed by AIMCo rather than the Alberta Teachers' Retirement Fund."
The teachers' union found their existing fund managers turned in better performance than AIMCo in each of the past seven years. Alberta Teachers' Association president said the results "refutes the government's ongoing claim that the management transfer to AIMCo will save money through reduced expenses."
Mr. Kenney also raised the idea of moving Alberta's contributions to the Canada Pension Plan into AIMCo. A 2019 study by the Fraser Institute found that over the past decade, Albertans made a cumulative net contribution of $27.9-billion to the CPP.
The study concluded: "Alberta disproportionately contributes to a host of national and federal programs."
While AIMCo does not release quarterly results, data released by LAPP as part of its normal quarterly disclosure shows that the fund manager's equity market investments were down by 24.1 per cent, compared with a 16.5 per cent decline in its benchmark. The poor performance reflected volatility-linked investments and a heavy weighting on value stocks, which fared poorly during the market's nose dive in March.
In April, Mr. Uebelein apologized for the losses on volatility trading, and said in an open letter: "Let me be clear, the performance of this investment is wholly unsatisfactory, and AIMCo's board and management share the frustration and disappointment of our clients, their beneficiaries and all Albertans."
AIMCo's real estate investment, which include shopping malls, were down by 4.1 per cent, compared with a 1.8-per-cent rise in the benchmark. Its private equity investments were down 1.5 per cent, while the bench mark in this asset class was up by 2.2 per cent. The fund manager's infrastructure investments were down 3.5 per cent, while the benchmark rose by 1.7 per cent. AIMCo's fixed income investment were up by 0.2 per cent, while the benchmark was up 1.7 per cent.
Last month, AIMCo's board launched an independent investigation into the fund manager's losses on investments linked to volatility, led by accounting firm KPMG LLP and a former executive at the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan. AIMCo employees are among the best paid government workers in Alberta: Its CEO and chief investment officer made $3.4-million and $3.6-million, respectively, last year.

Full text: Home sales in Toronto, Vancouver and Calgary rebounded in May, after collapsing in April as the novel coronavirus pandemic took hold.
Activity in May was still well below levels over most of the past year, however, and economic turmoil will likely hamper any broader housing recovery, experts said.
"There looks to be a fledgling recovery from the extreme conditions in April, but it's early days and we have a long road to climb," said Douglas Porter, chief economist with Bank of Montreal.
"It's very challenging to project what's ahead for the housing market with such an uncertain backdrop for the broader economy and how policy makers will respond to it in coming months."
In the Toronto region, the largest residential market in the country, 4,606 homes sold in May, up 53 per cent on a seasonally adjusted basis from the previous month. But that was 54 per cent lower than the same month last year, with condo sales leading the way down.
In the Vancouver area, 1,485 homes sold last month, a 34-per-cent increase from April, but a 44-per-cent drop compared with May of last year and well below the 10-year average.
In Calgary, which has also been hit by the sharp drop in oil prices, sales nearly doubled from April to 1,080, but were 44 per cent lower than May, 2019, with condos recording the steepest decline.
The Toronto Regional Real Estate Board said it is "very possible that home sales will continue to improve," if the economy continues to reopen. But economists warned against reading too much into the one-month rebound.
"Don't be fooled by May's large percentage gains," said Robert Hogue, senior economist with Royal Bank of Canada. "They will reverse only part of the huge declines in March and April. Activity in both markets is still running well below normal."
Before the pandemic shuttered large swaths of the country, housing markets were overheating in Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal, Ottawa and most of Southern Ontario.
Although sales dropped to near-record lows in April, prices remained relatively flat in May, with homeowners choosing to either suspend or avoid listing their properties.
In the Toronto area, the overall average real estate price was steady month to month.
But the home price composite index, which is an industry calculation that adjusts for shifts in types of homes sold, rose 9.4 per cent to $870,000, according to the local board.
Home prices in the Vancouver region, the priciest market in the country, also remained high. The home price composite index across all types of residential properties was $1,028,400 last month, flat compared with April and up 2.9 per cent from May of last year. Every type of property - including detached houses, townhouses and condos - recorded a small price increase, according to the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver.
With the number of coronavirus cases dwindling in B.C., the province started reopening businesses and buyers felt more comfortable resuming their home searches, according to mortgage brokers and realtors.
The real estate board said if home buyers and sellers can see that prices have not cratered, it gives them confidence to enter the market. Buyers are saying "prices are not running away from me," and sellers are saying "yes, there are buyers in the market. Let's do what we can to facilitate a sale," said Colette Gerber, board's chair.
Meanwhile, in Calgary, the benchmark price last month was $411,600, off slightly from April and down about 2 per cent from May, 2019.
Major losses of highly paid energy and tech sector jobs, along with a surplus of real estate, is expected to push prices down further.
In the Toronto and Vancouver regions, new listings continued to move in lockstep with sales - increasing from April to May, but falling compared with the same month last year.
The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. has forecast that national home prices will decline as much as 18 per cent from peak to trough. It expects prices to hit bottom in the second quarter of next year. That will occur after mortgage deferrals arranged during the pandemic are due to expire.
Banks have granted deferrals of up to six months for about 15 per cent of their mortgage holders. If those homeowners are unable to restart mortgage payments, they may be forced to sell their homes quickly and that could also depress prices.

Full text: DONE DEAL 653 Nolan Hill Blvd NW, Calgary NOLAN HILL Asking price: $500,000 Selling price: $485,000 Taxes: $3,270 (2019) Days on the market: 12 Listing agent: Jesse Davies, Century 21 Elevate Real Estate THE ACTION This standard threebedroom house on Calgary's far northern reaches was largely overlooked by buyers for five months. To get better traction, it was relisted early this year with another agent for a similar price but prepared and promoted differently.
"I asked the sellers to do a couple things around the house, in terms of staging and fixing some things. And we did some social-media campaigns and digital marketing, and we got an offer really quickly," agent Jesse Davies said.
"This home is in a more attractive price point because it's around $500,000, so it's more attractive to first-time home buyers. And in that community, they range from $450,000 to $750,000, so the higher-end stuff is harder to move."
WHAT THEY GOT Situated across from a local park, this four-yearold house offers more than 1,750 square feet of living space with interior access to a double garage and an exit to the 29-foot-by-114foot grounds through the eat-in kitchen.
There are entertaining areas on each level, including one with a gas fireplace on the main floor, and another in the 629-squarefoot basement.
There are four bathrooms and a laundry room on the second floor.
Homeowner association fees are $107 annually.
THE AGENT'S TAKE "It's across from a school and green space, so it's attractive to families," Mr. Davies said.

Full text: The first inkling that COVID-19 was inside Anson Place Care Centre, a seniors' residence in Southwestern Ontario, came through a phone call in midMarch from the local public health unit: An animal handler who brought a parrot, a snake and a ferret to the home to entertain residents had been exposed to the virus at another seniors' facility.
The privately owned home immediately went into lockdown, but lifted it three days later under the guidance of health officials. It would prove to be one of a series of fatal errors that allowed the virus to ravage the home in the rural community of Hagersville, near Hamilton, killing 27 of its 101 residents.
A Globe and Mail investigation found the outbreak resulted from failings at every level in the system designed to protect the frail elderly. The home, doctors at the local hospital, publichealth officials, provincial safety inspectors and Ontario's top medical officer all missed early opportunities to prevent the spread of the virus.
Everyone from the management of the home to the Premier's Office was slow to respond to cries for help from front-line health care workers, who were forced to ask both an Ontario Superior Court judge and the province's quasi-judicial Labour Relations Board to intervene.
It was only on April 21 - nearly a month after the first outbreak at a nursing home in Ontario - that Chief Medical Officer of Health David Williams ordered local public-health units to test everyone in long-term care homes for COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus.
The Globe investigation is based on hundreds of pages of documents filed in Ontario Superior Court, internal corporate records, Ministry of Labour inspection reports and interviews with several individuals close to the situation at Anson Place.
Among the findings in the investigation: Management at Anson Place did not follow its own pandemic plan, but instead kept residents made ill by COVID-19 alongside the healthy, causing the virus to spread.
Public health erroneously blamed the outbreak at Anson Place on those who attended a former resident's funeral, while not doing enough to help the home contain the spread of the virus.
The Ministry of Labour, which is responsible for ensuring that employers comply with workplace health and safety standards, has routinely inspected seniors' homes by phone rather than in person during the pandemic. Of the 612 COVID-19-related inspections done since March 12, only 25 were in person, according to ministry figures provided to The Globe.
Premier Doug Ford waited until mid-April to temporarily ban staff from working at more than one facility, even as the pandemic laid bare long-standing vulnerabilities in Canada's nursing homes: Low pay and a lack of full-time hours have forced staff to work at multiple homes.
Lisa Roth, executive director of Anson Place, said the home was guided in its handling of the outbreak by public-health officials, and has worked closely with the local health unit and the provincial government to update its infection-control and outbreak-management policies as health experts continue to improve their understanding of the new virus.
"Due to COVID-19's impact," she said, "our team was faced with unprecedented challenges."
The two-storey home has a retirement residence with 40 private rooms on the first floor and a long-term care unit on the second, with all but three of the 61 beds in shared wards. The longterm care unit was hit hardest, with 23 residents succumbing to the virus - a fatality rate of just less than 38 per cent. Four residents in the retirement unit died of the virus.
Anson Place is one of 11 forprofit homes in Ontario owned by Rykka Care Centres, a private Toronto-based company incorporated in 2006 by Ben Friedman and Sy Schachner, according to registration records. Mr. Friedman is the owner and chief executive of Saucham Holdings Ltd., a private real estate holding and development company. (Neither he nor Mr. Schachner could be reached for comment.)
The vast majority of Rykka's homes are older facilities, where up to four residents share a room and one bathroom. All but two are classified as "C" homes, meaning they meet the provincial Ministry of Long-Term Care's 1972 design standards.
Eight of Rykka's homes have had outbreaks of COVID-19, according to the Long-Term Care Ministry. The courts ordered three of those homes where 112 residents died of the virus - Anson Place, Eatonville Care Centre in Toronto and Hawthorne Place Care Centre in North York - to provide nurses with access to N95 respirator masks and other personal protective equipment.
The Ontario Labour Relations Board ordered the Ministry of Labour to conduct weekly, on-site inspections at Anson Place and Eatonville.
"Shame on people that it takes an order either from a court or from the Labour Relations Board to do the right thing to keep people safe," said Sharleen Stewart, president of SEIU Healthcare, which represents 60,000 workers.
Arthur Harek, a 95-year-old retired farmer, was the first victim of the virus at Anson Place, but no one suspected it at the time.
In the days leading up to his death on March 16, Mr. Harek was rushed to the hospital in Hagersville four times, said his daughter, Barbara Lalonde. Doctors at West Haldimand General Hospital attributed his difficulty breathing, lethargy and a cough to his heart condition, and sent him back to the retirement home. The day before he died, she said, he was back in the hospital. "I felt his back and it was rattling like crazy."
Shortly after, Ms. Lalonde, along with 11 members of her family, all tested positive for COVID-19.
"We've come to the assumption that Dad had it and that's where we got it," she said.
Her family was shocked when the Haldimand-Norfolk Health Unit publicly blamed the outbreak at the long-term care facility on Mr. Harek's funeral. "Staff have determined that a significant number of positive cases at Anson Place can be traced to attendance at a funeral," a news release dated April 5 says.
Both Ms. Lalonde and the
owner of the funeral home said that statement makes no sense.
No one from Anson Place attended the funeral, Ms. Lalonde said, and no one from her family had any reason to return to the home after her father's death.
Jill Thompson, the owner of Thompson-Mott Funeral Home, said 42 people, mostly family members, attended the service on March 20. No one from Mr. Harek's family contracted the virus from her funeral home or any of its staff members, she said, adding that her own test results came back negative.
"I don't understand why the medical officer said this," Ms. Thompson said. "To say it started here just medically doesn't make sense."
Shanker Nesathurai, the medical officer of health for Haldimand-Norfolk, said in an e-mail to The Globe that the health unit does not comment on matters involving individual community members. "Assessments of this nature cannot be used to attribute blame to any individual," he said.
Ms. Roth declined to comment on Mr. Harek's death, citing privacy concerns.
A copy of an Anson Place employee's Workplace Safety & Insurance Board report obtained by The Globe shows that a postmortem confirmed the first COVID-19 death at the home was March 16, the same day Mr. Harek died. It is not clear when the postmortem was done. A hospital official declined to comment, citing privacy concerns. Ms. Lalonde said no one told her family about the postmortem.
Two days after Mr. Harek's death, a public-health official warned Anson Place about a potential exposure to the coronavirus.
Rebecca Piironen, a personal support worker at Anson Place who answered the phone call, said the official asked if an animal trainer had visited the home.
When she said the trainer had entertained residents in the home's retirement unit on March 6, she said, the official "let us know the handler had come in contact with COVID-19 at another nursing home."
The next thing she knew, retirement residents on the first floor were confined to their rooms for three days, and staff on their unit were wearing full PPE.
But Ms. Piironen and other front-line staff who work on the long-term care unit on the second floor were not given PPE, she said, creating fears the home wasn't taking proper precautions to protect workers and residents.
Staff on the retirement and longterm care units share the same lunchroom and change room.
Another employee who asked not to be named out of concerns for her job said staff repeatedly asked the home's executive director, Ms. Roth, why the unit had been locked down. "She just kept saying, ‘Don't worry. It's not COVID related,' " the employee said. "She kept telling us that over and over again."
Anson Place ceased "isolation protocols" after receiving direction from public health, Ms. Roth said in an e-mail to The Globe.
The home relies on the health unit for advice during respiratory outbreaks, she said, and officials never clarified whether the potential exposure in the home from the animal handler was COVID-19.
Dr. Nesathurai said in the email to The Globe that his health unit advised Anson Place on the most appropriate approach to manage the exposure, while protecting a community member's confidential information. "As such," he said, "health unit practice related to exposures of this nature does not include disclosing the specific disease."
With regards to ending the isolation protocols, he said the decision was made based on the "course of the exposure."
Earlier in the pandemic, he said, patients were tested only if they had symptoms of the disease, adding that there can be a long time between exposure and laboratory confirmation of COVID-19.
The animal handler declined to talk to The Globe. His lawyer said no one who works for the handler had any symptoms of the virus on March 6, but would not say whether her client eventually tested positive for the virus.
It would be March 27 before Anson officially declared an outbreak. That same day, Mr. Harek's close friend in the retirement unit, Ruby McCarroll, tested positive for COVID-19.
Her son, Mike McCarroll, said his mother, a 95-year-old retired teacher, was mentally sharp in early February when she celebrated her grandson's birthday at a Red Lobster restaurant. But on March 23, she was hospitalized with a low-grade fever. She died on March 30.
"To figure out where the virus came from, the medical officer [of health] should have talked to people," said Mr. McCarroll, the lead plaintiff in a proposed classaction lawsuit against Anson Place. "He never talked to me."
By the end of March, the virus had spread quickly from the retirement residence on the first floor to the long-term care unit on the second floor. Staff were also getting sick, including Ms. Roth. She tested positive on March 31, according to her affidavit filed in court.
When staff at Anson Place complained to the Ontario Ministry of Labour about unsafe working conditions, including a lack of PPE, Shelly Speir, an inspector at the ministry, followed up by telephone instead of visiting the home.
Anson Place breezed through the first review on March 30, without a single order issued against it, according to a copy of the inspection report. In the second review on April 8, also by phone, the inspector told Anson Place to make face masks available for night staff, the report says.
On April 24, the Ontario Labour Relations Board ordered the Ministry of Labour to conduct weekly in-person inspections at Anson Place for the next two months. Three days later, Ms. Speir showed up at the home to see things for herself. She found plenty of problems that day.
In her written report, obtained by The Globe, Ms. Speir cites Anson Place for nine violations of provincial laws designed to protect workers from hazards on the job.
Among them: The person screening staff and visitors at the front door was not wearing protective eye goggles, and had to be reminded three times to take Ms. Speir's temperature; boxes of surgical masks were left open in a hallway, exposing them to contamination; workers who left the home during breaks returned wearing the same potentially contaminated face masks. By that time, 27 of the 101 residents had died and all but 29 of the survivors had tested positive for COVID-19. The home accounts for all but four deaths from the virus in the rural community.
Ms. Speir declined to comment when reached by The Globe. A spokesperson at the Ministry of Labour said it halted in-person inspections during the pandemic to help stop the virus from spreading in long-term care homes. Many complaints have revolved around PPE, the spokesperson said. "Often, these concerns can be dealt with remotely to the satisfaction of both the worker and employer without orders being issued."
The Ontario Nurses Association (ONA) accuses three of Rykka's homes in court documents of keeping residents made ill by COVID-19 with the healthy, causing the virus to spread, and of "severely" limiting staff members' access to PPE, including N95 respirator masks.
Ian Dick, a lawyer for Rykka, argued in court on April 22 that Anson Place is exempt from a provincial directive requiring sick residents to be segregated from healthy ones because of its small size. The long-term care unit has 15 rooms with two beds and seven with four beds, according to Rykka's service-accountability agreement with the province.
The directive from Ontario's Chief Medical Officer says, "In smaller long-term care homes or in homes where it is not possible to maintain physical distancing of staff or residents from each other, all residents or staff should be managed as if they are potentially infected."
Staff are required to wear surgical masks and other PPE.
Anson Place, it turns out, did not follow its own pandemic plan. A copy of the document dated May 14, 2018, prepared by Responsive Management Inc., Rykka's operating partner, says "residents will be segregated in specific areas in order to separate influenza and non-influenza residents to minimize the potential spread of organisms."
Instead, Anson Place closed a cloth curtain between ward beds to try to stop transmission of the virus. It also assumed all residents had tested positive for COVID-19, meaning they were kept in their rooms at all times, including for meals.
An Ontario Superior Court judge ordered the Rykka homes to make PPE available to nurses and to isolate residents sick with the disease during the crisis.
No one at Anson Place has died since April 22, and only 22 residents remain ill with the virus, prompting Ms. Roth to say she believes the home is "turning the corner."
Ms. Piironen, the personal support worker who has been off work sick since early April with many symptoms of the virus, but tested negative, says she feels betrayed by everyone responsible for safe-guarding the home.
"They didn't protect us. They didn't protect the residents. They didn't protect our community," she said.

Full text: The coronavirus crisis has prompted governments everywhere to launch major technological initiatives at a frenetic pace. Many of the world's most powerful tech companies have already chimed in.
Yet earlier this month, Google affiliate Sidewalk Labs abandoned one of the most ambitious "smart city" projects on the continent when it withdrew from a proposed 12-acre, technology-laced community to be built on old industrial land on Toronto's waterfront.
After 21/2 years of courting support and generating controversy, the urban-planning subsidiary of Mountain View, Calif.-based Alphabet Inc. said May 7 that the pandemic's economic fallout had killed the business case for its calling-card project.
Outfitted with robotic garbage sorters, adaptive streetlights, heated pavement tiles and - potentially - reams of data-collecting sensors, the project, called Quayside, was supposed to be a showpiece for the city and the company. Three levels of government had signed on to support creating something far grander than the generic condo towers that line much of the rest of Toronto's downtown waterfront.
But the death of Quayside was part of a pattern of internal and external clashes and disappointments that stretches back nearly to Sidewalk's inception.
What began with a blank canvas to reimagine cities often became defined by a tug-of-war between competing interests: first between urbanists and technologists, then between Sidewalk, its government partners and the city it hoped to build in.
The Globe and Mail has spoken with more than a dozen sources close to Sidewalk and its Toronto project for this story, including people familiar with its earliest days, people close to its management and people close to significant decisions made by its government partner, Waterfront Toronto. (The Globe is not identifying the sources because of potential professional repercussions.)
Sidewalk Labs declined to comment on the details of this story, including regarding whether there was a pattern of clashes and disappointments. But the ideas it established in Toronto "represent a meaningful contribution to Sidewalk Labs' future work of tackling big urban problems, particularly in the areas of affordability and sustainability," spokeswoman Keerthana Rang said in an e-mail.
Torontonians are now left with the same empty half-billion-dollar plot of land they started with, and Sidewalk's future is unclear.
"Sidewalk has produced remarkably little - a handful of struggling startups and an exhibition centre for a failed real estate project," says Anthony Townsend, author of the 2013 book Smart Cities, who subsequently did paid contract work for Sidewalk.
"I suspect that a lot of important people in Mountain View are wondering whether it has a future."
Years before Sidewalk Labs tried to reinvent Toronto's shoreline the way Google changed how people navigate the internet, Google co-founder Larry Page and his executive chair, Eric Schmidt, reached out to former New York deputy mayor Dan Doctoroff in November, 2014.
Mr. Doctoroff, now 61, was winding down his time running information giant Bloomberg LP, with founder Michael Bloomberg set to return as CEO.
Within Google, Mr. Page had developed a secretive group - called Javelin - for side projects and he was thinking about how technology could improve cities. With experience in business and politics, Mr. Doctoroff signed on as CEO of the company that became Sidewalk.
He and Google recruited a cadre of technologists and urban-affairs experts, and sold them on a vision of making city life easier. But some of them quickly soured on the dream. People close to the company say many came to see those ambitions as a glossy veneer masking a real estate play.
A source close to current management disagreed with this characterization, pointing out that Sidewalk at this time was also investing in tech firms such as Cityblock Health, a digital health care company.
Sidewalk has said in marketing materials that urbanists and technologists have a natural difference of viewpoints that can create "powerful outcomes," but the company's first two years were marked by a clash of visions between the two worlds. Sources say Google-style technologists wanted to get some kind of product to market quickly - possibly in a standalone community - while urbanists treaded more slowly, cautioning about the slow pace of city building. It could be a difficult place to work, and some clashes turned into angry blowups.
The source close to the company's management said many of the tensions were natural for a startup with growing pains, enhanced by the desire to bridge these disparate perspectives.
In the early days, Mr. Doctoroff was also in the midst of merging an ad company and an urban-tech firm into a new business called Intersection, which he now chairs. That company went on to join a consortium that installed LinkNYC-branded WiFi kiosks across New York City. Those kiosks have created controversy over the user data they collect and because municipal officials revealed last March that Intersection hadn't paid millions of dollars it owed to the city. (Sidewalk and LinkNYC declined to comment on this.)
In his 2017 memoir about his time as deputy mayor, Greater than Ever, Mr. Doctoroff describes a strong interest in dense Olympic Games bid books dating back to the 1990s and his involvement in bids to bring the Games to New York.
As staff sought to get Mr. Page's blessing to find a partner city to develop a technology-infused community, Sidewalk's first major project was a bid book of its own. Sheathed in a lemon-coloured cover, the 437-page 2016 document became known as the "Yellow Book." It was the source of much internal frustration and caused an uproar among surveillance experts when The Globe revealed its contents in 2019.
Sidewalk brought in dozens of urban-affairs experts to consult for the book, but did not incorporate many of their suggestions in the book's final text, sources said, even as the book highlighted their involvement. Sidewalk declined to comment on this.
The process was also disorganized, sources said.
The experts were supposed to be given American Express gift cards worth thousands of dollars as thanks for their contributions, but sources said more than $100,000 worth of these cards were forgotten in a drawer for months.
Some staff were uncomfortable with the book's data-use proposals: A "Project Sidewalk" community might not just track individuals' movements, but could try to predict them. Other ideas were considered bizarre, if not infeasible, such as putting a dome on top of the community. It also suggested Sidewalk get the power to levy its own property taxes and control some public services.
Sidewalk last year said the book's ideas were the result of a "wide-ranging brainstorming process" and they were not under consideration by the time it was working on the Toronto project.
Mr. Page regularly beamed into the New York office from California for video conferences, sometimes while walking on a treadmill, said people who witnessed these calls. But when Sidewalk executives brought the Yellow Book to Mr. Page in Mountain View in the spring of 2016, people familiar with the meeting said he described different expectations than the ones outlined in the book. Through Alphabet, a representative for Mr. Page did not respond to requests for comment, while the source close to Sidewalk Labs management said Mr. Page approved a majority of the book's proposals, encouraging the company to seek out a partner city.
Sources familiar with the meeting's result, however, said the Google co-founder asked if a city could be built in as little as five years, and wanted it to be primarily low-rise, despite urbanists' natural push for density.
Location was another issue, those sources said.
Mr. Page wanted to build across San Francisco Bay in Alameda, while some Sidewalk executives and staff preferred Denver or Detroit; one person involved in the Yellow Book thought Sidewalk might even try to buy a Detroit automaker to help with driverless vehicles.
The sources described the period after the meeting as a long hangover, as Sidewalk tried to align Mr. Page's expectations with what was possible in today's cities, while the company put more focus on launching urban-tech startups.
The hangover didn't last long.
In June, 2016, a Waterfront Toronto manager who'd worked on New York's Olympic bid with Mr. Doctoroff in the early 2000s sent him an e-mail. "My new CEO and I are very interested in what you are doing at Google and would like to talk to you about a potential pilot in Toronto," he wrote, according to a later report by Ontario's Auditor-General, Bonnie Lysyk.
That CEO, Will Fleissig, wanted to do something innovative with the 12-acre parcel of land at the foot of Parliament Street called Quayside. Waterfront Toronto is a partnership created by the federal, provincial and municipal governments in 2001 to help revitalize the city's lakeshore. Developing Quayside was a crucial part of that, and Waterfront was reaching out to a handful of suitors to gauge their interest - although Ms. Lysyk later found Sidewalk had received more information than others.
While Sidewalk developed a bid for the site, sources close to the bid say people inside the company spoke about it as though it had already won.
Waterfront Toronto opened the project for bids in March, 2017. Sidewalk won the following October and it has always maintained, including in response to Ms. Lysyk's report, that it had no influence over the bidding process.
During its 21/2 years in Toronto, Sidewalk became embroiled in controversies about the privacy and data implications of the Quayside project, and - eventually - its extensive plans to have influence over a much wider portion of Toronto's lakeshore.
The Waterfront board's vote to partner with Sidewalk was later described as rushed, with little time to study the proposal.
As the project advanced, several people who shepherded it early on quit or were fired. They included Mr. Fleissig, who resigned from Waterfront in the summer of 2018 - a natural step, he said, as Quayside went from theory to reality. But several sources told The Globe last year that the board had been dissatisfied with his leadership.
Many Quayside critics said data governance was their foremost concern. The project's many sensors could collect massive amounts of information about people.
Sidewalk promised to respect privacy, and to share some royalties from new tech built with the data Canadians generated. But opponents, including the Canadian Civil Liberties Association, feared that such mass data collection could, accidentally or otherwise, set an example of a high-surveillance future. Several expert advisers left in 2018 over such concerns, including former Ontario privacy commissioner Ann Cavoukian.
That December, the Auditor-General published a highly critical report on the project. Ontario Premier Doug Ford's cabinet soon fired the three Waterfront directors it had appointed, including chair Helen Burstyn.
Later that winter, media obtained an internal Sidewalk Labs document showing the company hoped to get a cut of property taxes and other fees in exchange for its investment on the lakeshore, including in transit infrastructure. This prompted a renewed outcry from critics - although a person close to Sidewalk said that people in the office described it as a tentative idea meant to keep Alphabet satisfied that the project could eventually be profitable. The source close to Sidewalk management disagreed with this characterization, echoing earlier Sidewalk comments that it was a serious attempt to fund transit to make the community more accessible.
After a behind-the-scenes campaign led by Toronto Mayor John Tory, veteran developer Stephen Diamond was appointed Waterfront's chair in early 2019. That June, Sidewalk published its long-delayed master plan for Toronto. In another massive, Olympic-bid-style document, Sidewalk said it wanted rights to plan and put technology across 190 acres - a site 16 times larger than Quayside.
Sidewalk had hinted at such ambitions in its original bid and had discussed the need for a larger site inside the company. But the move struck opponents and governments as a massive overreach. Mr. Diamond began a four-month campaign to make Sidewalk come to Waterfront's terms.
On Oct. 31, Sidewalk acquiesced, returning to 12 acres and granting more favourable terms for Canadian data and intellectual-property rights. Though not fully detailed, the latter shift appeased critics such as BlackBerry pioneer Jim Balsillie, who had warned Alphabet, but not necessarily Canadians, could be further enriched by intellectual property generated with Canadians' data at the site. The new deal also marked a shift in tone: Mr. Doctoroff became cautious in public, regularly noting that Sidewalk had to make a financial case for the reduced size.
Waterfront and Sidewalk spent the first few months of 2020 negotiating terms ahead of a final June 25 Waterfront board vote on whether to proceed. While Waterfront was satisfied with the most recent negotiations, it wanted guarantees that Alphabet would financially backstop the project, a source said.
But by that point, Mr. Page had stepped down as Alphabet's CEO and the company began cutting back on side projects. Then COVID-19 hit.
The world's economy was thrown into tatters and commercial real estate started looking far less lucrative. Alphabet reportedly began pulling back on real estate investments in California. Sidewalk was largely silent - though Mr. Doctoroff did pen a New York Times op-ed about how the city could weather the crisis.
The article did not mention Toronto - but did seem to acknowledge lessons learned there, calling for a "robust framework for data governance, ensuring that people don't have to choose between their health and their privacy."
In the late afternoon of May 6, Mr. Diamond and Waterfront's government partners, including Mr. Ford, found out from Sidewalk that it was walking away.
They spent the evening figuring out how to deal with the news.
The next morning, Sidewalk e-mailed the media: It was abandoning Quayside, citing the pandemic's economic devastation for its decision to shift away from its city-building vision for Toronto; the company said it was going back to its earlier focus on startups and individual city-related technologies.
Joe Cressy, a Toronto councillor who represents the city on Waterfront's board, says that Sidewalk launched important conversations about how Toronto should plan for its future - but that the project was undercut by two "original sins."
He believes that Sidewalk overpromised and underdelivered: that the partnership was announced with great excitement but unclear details about its execution, while Sidewalk was far too confident it would get the extra land beyond Quayside that it sought.
"The scope, and lack of specificity, contributed both to the public debate but also, ultimately, the financial-viability [argument]" for Sidewalk walking away, Mr. Cressy says.
Waterfront still plans to build a "next-generation community" on Lake Ontario, but as it examines how life will change after the pandemic, "we will take the time necessary to determine what our next steps will be to bring this valuable asset to market," spokesman Andrew Tumilty said.
Sidewalk says it will keep a presence in Toronto, redeploying as many of its 30 local staff as possible to other initiatives. A second source close to Sidewalk management said that the company is talking with other cities they declined to name, noting that it often has such talks with potential partners. The company is willing to deploy individual technologies or package them in ways similar to the Quayside project, the source said.
The company says it will keep investing in urban tech, including in-house projects around efficientenergy usage; automation of building-design processes to accommodate local needs; and sustainable construction of wood-structured buildings. "Tall timber" wood buildings were to be a key part of Quayside, which would have included a component factory in Ontario. While Sidewalk will still pursue a factory, it will no longer guarantee it will be in the province.
Mr. Doctoroff is also a director of Sidewalk Infrastructure Partners, a partnership with Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan announced last year, which will invest in technology-infused infrastructure across North America - building on Mr. Doctoroff's long experience financing projects in New York.
"The current health emergency makes us feel even more strongly about the importance of reimagining cities for the future," the CEO wrote in a blog post the day of the cancellation. Sidewalk has yet to announce any specific initiatives connected to the pandemic.
Shannon Mattern, a professor at New York's New School for Social Research who studies urban technology, said she thinks public pushback played a large role in the cancellation, but the company has framed itself as ready and able to help other cities and could soon appear elsewhere.
"History tells us that there's something very appealing to administrations about the solution-in-abox model of addressing multiple urban concerns simultaneously," Prof. Mattern says.
People who've been on the inside, however, wonder if cities will examine Sidewalk's track record.
"Sidewalk came out of the gate promising to reinvent the city," says Mr. Townsend, the smart-city expert who consulted for the company. "What it has produced are a handful of slow-growing startups and an untested scheme for tall timber that's years behind Europe's leaders."

Full text: Almost a decade ago, after having moved into an older downtown condominium, my wife and I attended our building's annual general meeting. After discussing routine items, the condo president's voice developed a noticeable shake as he handed out a rather innocentlooking sheet of paper: due to deferred maintenance, we, personally, owed $17,000 as part of a special assessment. As we picked our jaws up off the floor, a much calmer, older gentleman raised his hand and asked to speak. Since his much larger unit necessitated an even larger sum - I believe he also owned one of the commercial units in the building - he quite reasonably asked what efforts the condo board had put into finding other sources of revenue (or savings) before, well, sticking us with the bill.
In Europe, he continued, concierge staff do much more than accept packages and push the button that unlocks the front door: They fix things, do a little cleaning during the night shift, change light bulbs and even assist older residents with certain tasks.
While this didn't seem like much, over the decades, he argued, it could've saved our building a lot of money.
And while this sage advice fell on deaf ears that day - after living there for eight more years, we were slapped with a second special assessment - I couldn't help but think of this as I pored over an interesting study by Quadrangle Architecture + Interiors titled Neighbourhood Nests.
Here, the condo concierge or security guard's role as "passive gatekeeper" has been reimagined and rechristened as the much more active "nest curator."
Three weeks ago, I wrote about what the post-COVID world of architecture might look like; Quadrangle, logically, has anticipated that we might not have the luxury of time. Before we can build new, we'll have to alter existing architecture to meet the demands of the next pandemic or climatechange emergency. And we'll have to do it in the most friendly and familiar way possible, says Quadrangle's director of innovation, architect Michelle Xuereb.
"One of the overlapping factors that came up in all of our shared spaces that we love was it had the barista, or it had the bartender, or it had that person that we liked," she begins. "So, in a building where you've already got a person who is sitting there all day ... what if you changed their job description? If their job was to be inclusive rather than exclusive, not keeping people out, but welcoming people in, having a coffee station set up, having a shelf for books for kids, different kinds of seating around ... and then it's about what that person does to curate that space and make it a place that people want to be."
Of course, Ms. Xuereb isn't speaking about an average Tuesday. She's speaking about what a condominium lobby could become if, say, Toronto finally sees a sequel to Hurricane Hazel in the next few years. People from all over the neighbourhood - people who wouldn't normally hang out in a building they don't live in - would know to congregate at their neighbourhood nest for shelter and have a hot coffee while they strategize, pool resources and remotely check in on loved ones. And because that building would be equipped with backup power, critical-goods refrigeration and a reserve of clean water, their minds would be on how to help others, not their own safety.
During a physical-distancing event, while that same lobby might be empty save for the nest curator, those same locals would know to check notices posted in the nest's window for critical information or even a cheer-me-up graphic.
And those who live inside the building would also benefit, the architect says: "One of the things that came up was grocery delivery; imagine if [the nest curator] booked a couple of delivery dates and reached out to everyone in the building? Then they could curate people coming down to pick up their groceries, so then you don't have people worried about going out." And then, as things got back to normal, the nest curator could keep everyone informed as he or she orchestrated the rollout of phases.
The creation of neighbourhood nests wouldn't mean that libraries or community centres would lose their importance, either.
"Those are on a certain scale," Ms. Xuereb says. "Our idea behind this was what if you could increase the fabric of that, provide a whole bunch of smaller nodes within the larger one?" "It's really about our social infrastructure. That's our resilience."
And, save for a few upfront costs for a backup generator or water reservoir - nature has taught us that redundancy is key to survival - much of what it would take to transform a space into a neighbourhood nest would involve a change of furniture or traffic patterns, a nice coffee machine perhaps and, most importantly, a change in human behaviour (as we've seen in recent months, when faced with a common threat, that can be achieved pretty quickly).
"If one piece of the spider web breaks, it's not necessarily catastrophic," Ms. Xuereb finishes.
"And that's the idea: You build enough social connections that you keep going."

Full text: At first glance, the diminutive red house in Toronto's East Chinatown appeared dark and cramped and in need of TLC.
But architects Winda Lau and Andrea Yeatman of Studio Lau felt a surge of exhilaration when they walked through the door.
"We were excited about the transformation we could do," Ms. Lau says.
Their next task was to inspire the same enthusiasm in the new owners.
The clients were a young couple who took over the two-storey home near Dundas Street East and Broadview Avenue from the husband's family.
The young man's grandmother had purchased the sturdy detached house in 1970 and he had fond memories of spending time with her in the east end neighbourhood close to Riverdale Park.
When his grandmother moved to new accommodations, the young man's relatives urged him to keep the home in the family.
His wife was a little more hesitant to give up their comfortable, west-end condo for an older house that often felt chilly and dark.
But her husband's nostalgia for visiting local shops with his grandmother and careering down the toboggan run at Riverdale Park won her over. They both liked the renewal coming to the area, with an A&W and cool, independent coffee shops opening up between the traditional Chinese grocery stores.
Once the couple committed to the move, they thought about tearing down the house and starting over, or topping it up with a third floor, but Ms. Lau and Ms. Yeatman saw potential in the existing structure.
The architects pointed out that expanding at the rear would be less costly than the expense of building up.
"That's part of the fun - it's a bit like a puzzle," Ms. Lau says of figuring out the best use of space within the constraints of a budget.
They came up with a design for a modern rear addition that added bright and modern spaces while preserving some elements of the original home.
"We wanted to really open up the space," Ms. Yeatman says of the new plan, which replaces an interior of small compartments.
The house is now approximately 2,200 square feet above ground, which is the maximum the zoning would allow without getting special planning permission, the architects say. By staying within the regulations, the homeowners didn't face long delays waiting for approvals.
Today the front door opens to an intimate foyer that the architects created with the use of white oak accents that define the space while adding warmth and texture.
The existing staircase was torn down and rebuilt with one step that wraps around to become a long bench - painted black to add interest.
The architects brought in a structural engineer to hide a column in the combined closet and dividing wall between the foyer and the living room. That way they could tear out the support walls that compartmentalized the interior and create a modern, open plan.
Beyond the foyer, the space suddenly opens up to a larger area for lounging, with a kitchen and dining area at the rear.
The architects drew up a few different configurations, they say, that could have put the dining area in the middle of the house, for example, and a family room at the rear. In the end, the couple opted for an expanded living area that gives them room for a large sectional sofa and space to lounge in front of the television.
The kitchen is at the rear, with a dining area beside the sliding glass doors that open to the garden.
The grandmother's living room at the front of the house is still there, with the original window opening. Removing the trim from the window made it look bigger, and the architects reconfigured it so that there's a large expanse of glass and a smaller, operable portion beside it.
They added a deep sill to bring in more light and provide a place for plants.
The fireplace has been transformed with paint in a deep shade of charcoal and a thin oak mantle.
"When there are nice old elements in a house we like to keep them," Ms. Lau says.
"When we do our interventions, we like them to be contemporary."
An alcove - painted in dramatic black - leads to a powder room tucked in beside the foyer.
The expansive new kitchen gives the couple much more space than they had in their condo. One homeowner likes to bake and now has plenty of space to lay out trays of pastries on the large island.
Extra-deep sinks accommodate the largest pots and pans.
The architects provided lots of storage space and built-ins so that small appliances can remain hidden and the kitchen stays uncluttered.
Ms. Lau and Ms. Yeatman had the island painted in a deep, rich blue that provides contrast with the white cabinets. They also chose the light fixtures above the island and throughout the main floor.
"That's part of our holistic approach," Ms. Lau says. "We think every element that's attached to the house is part of it."
Upstairs, the architects removed remnants of a tenant's kitchen and bathroom to return the dwelling to a single-family home.
A skylight above the hallway brings light into the centre of the house.
There are two bedrooms at the front of the house, one in the centre and a large master suite at the rear.
In the new addition, the architects created a large bedroom with built-in closets and a picture window with a built-in oak window seat overlooking the backyard.
The ensuite master bath provides luxurious touches such as heated floors, a stand-alone tub and a walk-in shower.
The architects created a wet area that places the tub and shower behind a glass partition at the back. The dry area at the front has a vanity with double sinks and wood veneer.
The mix of black-and-white tiles in a geometric pattern is timeless, Ms. Lau says.
"I think the black tub is really striking."
Outside, the architects gave the exterior a more calm and contemporary look. The brick had already been painted red so they painted over that and used black metal window frames and siding to complement the soft ecru.
The basement is also newly excavated so the couple can work on finishing it over time.
The architects had a few challenges to overcome along the way, they say, because the site is so confined and parking is scarce on the one-way street. The only access to the backyard is through a narrow walkway that runs alongside the house, so using large equipment to dig out the basement was not an option.
Curious neighbours who remember the grandmother often dropped by to check on the progress.
Gradually problems were overcome and, after about one year of construction, the house was move-in ready.
The couple will work on landscaping as the weather improves. They also plan to have lots of family gatherings.
The clan is amazed at the transformation, the couple says, and family members enjoy coming over to visit. But the shock hasn't completely worn off: One or two members of the older generation are taking a little time to get used to how modern the cherished red house has become.

Full text: Canada's national housing agency is predicting home prices could plummet up to 18 per cent and mortgage arrears could soar to 20 per cent, a forecast some economists and real estate experts say is a particularly dire assessment of the pandemic's effect on the housing market.
Late on Tuesday, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. chief executive Evan Siddall said average home prices could drop between 9 per cent and 18 per cent over the coming 12 months. He said mortgage deferrals could jump from 12 per cent to 20 per cent by September, and that as much as one-fifth of all mortgages could be in arrears if the Canadian economy has not recovered sufficiently.
"The resulting combination of higher mortgage debt, declining house prices and increased unemployment is cause for concern for Canada's longer-term financial stability," Mr. Siddall said in prepared remarks to the federal standing committee on finance.
CMHC's forecast is more pessimistic than those of big-bank economists. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce expects home prices to fall between 5 per cent and 10 per cent this year compared with 2019.
Royal Bank of Canada sees a decline of 7 per cent from the peak to trough and and Bank of Montreal expects a drop of about 5 per cent for the MLS home price index, which adjusts for shifts in the types of homes sold.
A price drop of 18 per cent would far surpass those of previous downturns.
The steepest declines occurred from 1981 to 1982 and from 1994 to 1995, when the average selling price across the country fell 5 per cent, according to data from the Canadian Real Estate Association.
"[Mr. Siddall] that all these things will happen if the economy ‘does not recover sufficiently.' That's a very broad statement," CIBC deputy chief economist Benjamin Tal said. "Without looking at the assumption behind that statement regarding GDP growth, unemployment rate and so on, it is very difficult to assess the likelihood of such a prediction. Is it a worst-case scenario, or the base case? I think he was highlighting a worst-case scenario," he said.
Douglas Porter, chief economist with Bank of Montreal, called the prediction for an 18per-cent drop in prices to be "oddly specific given the massive degree of uncertainty around the outlook at this time."
The latest real estate statistics show national home sales declined 57 per cent from March to April and the average selling price fell 10.9 per cent over the same period, although the sales volume was low and the drop in luxury home sales skewed the average.
Since the pandemic slammed the economy in March, real estate associations have painted a relatively rosy picture. In the Toronto region, where activity had been overheating before the pandemic, its local board said home prices would remain flat compared with last year because sales and new listings have so far declined in tandem and reduced competition for properties.
"Eighteen per cent is a crazy prediction. I am shocked they would say that," said Christopher Alexander, Re/Max's regional director for Ontario and Eastern Canada. He said properties in Toronto, Ottawa and Vancouver continue to draw multiple offers during the pandemic.
But given the millions of job losses and collapse in economic output, mortgage expert Robert McLister said it was a rational outlook.
"Canada would be incredibly lucky to get away with only a 10per-cent home price sell-off.
CMHC's 9-per-cent to 18-per-cent price drop estimate is completely reasonable, knowing how futile forecasting is with so many unknowns," said Mr. McLister, founder of mortgage brokerage RateSpy.com.
CMHC also highlighted the country's record level of household debt, which skyrocketed after the Great Recession because of rock-bottom interest rates and soaring home prices, and said the ratio of debt to disposable income could jump to more than 200 per cent next year from 176 per cent last year.
Mr. Siddall said his agency is getting ready for a "growing debt deferral cliff that looms in the fall, when some unemployed people will need to start paying their mortgages again."
He said that as much as onefifth of all mortgages could be in arrears if the Canadian economy has not recovered by then and said CMHC may have to start tightening underwriting standards for borrowers who have less than a 20-per-cent down payment on a property and require home insurance.
As of mid-May, banks have provided mortgage deferrals to more than 740,000 homeowners, according to the Canadian Bankers Association, which represents 15 per cent of the number of mortgages in bank portfolios. The deferrals started in March and are for a maximum of six months.
"Mortgage payment deferrals have been a necessary step to help Canadians weather the storm brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. However, they have also introduced a potential scenario where the rate of residential mortgage delinquencies could materially surpass the highest levels ever recorded," National Bank of Canada said in a note to clients.
According to CBA data, the arrears for bank mortgages rate peaked at 0.65 per cent in 1992 and 1997. A mortgage is considered in arrears if the borrower has missed payments for a minimum of three months.
Canadians may get a better understanding of the mortgage default risk when banks start reporting their latest quarterly results next week.
"Further concessions will have to be made once this six-month period expires," said Dustin Van Der Hout, investment adviser with Richardson GMP Ltd.
"You can call it what you want, deferrals, arrears or defaults, but if someone hasn't paid you for six months-plus, it's just by the lenders' choice they aren't forcing a default. And I don't think they're doing it because they're lovely institutions. It's not in their interest to foreclose on everyone all at once."

Full text: DONE DEAL 20818 McDougald Road, Summerland, B.C.
SUMMERLAND Asking price: $5.2-million Selling price: $5.2-million Previous selling price: $3.1-million (2015) Days on market: 14 Taxes: $13,641 (2020) Listing agent: Richard Deacon, Engel & Völkers Okanagan THE ACTION A Calgary investor had purchased the acreage at a deep discount in 2015. They listed the property late last summer and the agent received an offer two weeks later which was accepted.
Mr. Deacon believes that the buyer is U.S. based. It was a complicated purchase, with negotiations over numerous upgrades and the deal finally closed on Feb. 26.
"It had 30 or 40 enquiries, which is rare for a $5-million property," Mr. Deacon said. He also received a back-up offer, which is an ideal situation for a seller.
WHAT THEY GOT This 13-acre property includes a commercial winery, a special event space, 1,000 feet of lake front and a five-bedroom, four-bathroom house, which had been rented out as an Airbnb guesthouse.
Listing agent Richard Deacon said the owners of Penticton, B.C.based Evolve cellars had leased the property for several years and now another local winery has taken over.
THE AGENT'S TAKE Mr. Deacon said the real estate market in April was dead, but now he's "working around the clock."
People nearing retirement are driving the market, mostly coming from B.C.'s Lower Mainland and Alberta, seeking either primary or secondary homes in wine country, where their dollar goes further. And then there are international buyers leaving the urban areas.
"COVID has accelerated their decisions to purchase based on lifestyle."

Full text: 500 Richmond St. W., No. 307, Toronto FASHION DISTRICT Asking price: $999,900 Selling price: $984,500 Previous selling prices: $450,450 (2011); $437,500 (2009); $380,000 (2006); $263,500 (2002); $193,338 (2000) Taxes: $3,486 (2019) Days on the market: Four Listing agent: Christopher Bibby, Re/Max Hallmark Bibby Group Realty THE ACTION During first half of March, agent Christopher Bibby rushed to list three suites as sellers sensed a global pandemic might impact the local real estate market. In the case of this twostorey unit at Cityscape Terrace, it was deep cleaned, staged, filmed and photographed in less than 48 hours. The sellers moved out, which allowed for a dozen showings, and returned after a deal was signed on Friday the 13th.
"We were pushing everything out as fast as possible because we had an idea of what was about to come," Mr. Bibby said.
"When Premier Doug Ford announced the closure of non-essential businesses that's when a lot of transactions came to a halt, so our timing was ideal."
WHAT THEY GOT This 20-year-old mid-rise is well known for its collection of large two-storey suites, such as this 1,141-square-foot version. It has two bedrooms upstairs and an open principal room below with access to a south-facing balcony.
The semi-ensuite bathroom was recently updated, and the kitchen was given new granite counters and stainless steel appliances, including a gas stove.
The unit comes with laundry machines, a storage locker and parking. Water costs are covered by monthly fees of $610.
THE AGENT'S TAKE "A lot of neighbouring buildings along Brant and King [streets] have more one-bedroom units from 400 to 600 square feet or two bedroom [plans] around 800 square feet," Mr. Bibby said.
"This almost feels like a townhouse more than anything else."
This third-floor unit also has unexpected vistas. "One of the unique features is that, where we were situated in the building, you had a south view all the way down Brant Street," Mr. Bibby said.

Full text: People across Britain packed golf courses, tennis courts and public transit on Wednesday as the country's near-total lockdown eased for the first time in nearly two months.
The U.K. had been under tight restrictions since March 23 but this week Prime Minister Boris Johnson unveiled a multistage plan to lift the lockdown over the next three months. The first step began Wednesday, with people allowed to leave their homes for outdoor activities. Mr. Johnson also encouraged people who can't work from home to return to their jobs and he said some businesses, such as garden centres, could reopen.
By Wednesday morning, outdoor enthusiasts had headed to golf courses and tennis courts and many tourists flocked to seaside beaches. "It was lovely," said Ray Holder as he finished 18 holes at the Hunstanton Golf Club in Norfolk. "It's so good to be back playing. It's been 50 days." The club was only open to members and players had to book tee times online. They also couldn't linger on the course and the clubhouse remained closed along with practice greens.
Real estate agents began showing houses again on Wednesday and Ford Motor Co. announced plans to reopen its two plants in Wales and England next week.
Not everyone welcomed Mr. Johnson's plan. Several union leaders worried about scenes of overcrowded underground trains and buses in London, and many businesses have yet to outline physical-distancing guidelines.
"Maintaining social distancing on trains and the tube is a massive logistical exercise that requires planning," said Mick Cash, general secretary of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers. "RMT has made it clear that our members have a right to refuse to work in unsafe conditions."
Mr. Johnson's decision to stop urging people to stay at home has also caused deep division among regions. Several seaside resorts have balked at reopening beaches and parks, fearing that visitors might spark a resurgence of the virus. The tourism board for Blackpool changed its name on social media this week to "Do Not Visit Blackpool" in a bid to dissuade tourists. "There's nothing we can do, given the Prime Minister's advice, to stop people walking on the promenade or the beach, [but] we urge people to not visit Blackpool at the current time," council leader Simon Blackburn told local reporters this week.
The First Ministers of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have also refused to adopt Mr. Johnson's plan and kept restrictions largely in place. Most of the powers related to the lockdown have been devolved to the regional governments and they have yet to agree on a U.K.-wide approach to managing the pandemic. Scotland's First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, said on Wednesday that her government might remove some restrictions next week, but it wasn't clear if she would go as far as the Prime Minister. "If I get things wrong, I would rather the price of getting things wrong is that people stay in lockdown for a few more days and that the price is not measured in unnecessary deaths," she told the Scottish Parliament.
Mr. Johnson has dismissed the criticism and insisted the country was working together. "All those who talk about confusion and mixed messages are grossly overstating their position," he told the House of Commons on Wednesday. "The common sense of the British people is shining through.
They can see where we want to go."
The Prime Minister has been motivated in part by dire warnings about the state of the economy. Figures released Wednesday by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed the economy shrank by 2 per cent in the second quarter, which ended on March 31. That included only a few weeks of the pandemic, which took hold in Britain in midMarch. The ONS said the economy contracted by 5.8 per cent in March and most economists have forecast a far steeper decline in the third quarter. The Bank of England has said the country was on track for the worst recession in 300 years in 2020.
"The speed by which this crisis has onset has been alarming," said a report by James Smith, a developed-markets economist at ING. Mr. Smith also held out little hope the economy would rebound next year. "The prospects of a ‘V-shape' recovery have long since faded, and we don't expect the size of the U.K. economy to return to pre-virus levels until at least 2022."

Deep retrofits are key to climate change progress

Full text: When Allied Properties Real Estate Investment Trust last year established a dedicated budget for energy and water conservation measures in some of its centuryplus brick-and-beam office buildings, the results produced almost immediate gains.
Instead of one-off upgrades, as before, Allied assessed its entire portfolio to identify those buildings with above-average utility costs, a reasonable rate of return for the proposed improvements, eligibility for government incentives and the potential to improve indoor comfort for tenants. With a budget of $2.3-million, including $350,000 in government incentives, Allied generated $1-million in energy savings in 24 buildings in just less than two years.
Successful energy retrofits of commercial buildings, especially for Class B and C, are seen by conservation advocates as the next frontier if Canada, as pledged by the federal government, is to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 30 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030. Canada's buildings represent 11 per cent of GHG emissions and are more energy intensive than those in other developed countries with similar climates, according to the federal government's 2019 expert panel on sustainable finance, which targeted insufficient "deep retrofit" efforts in mid-size and smaller buildings.
"When it comes to existing buildings, the [real estate] industry has done a very good job in managing and retrofitting the larger office buildings in Canada," says Thomas Mueller, president and chief executive of the Canada Green Building Council. "When it comes to Class B and C offices, the industry has done very little to improve energy efficiency or improved carbon performance."
Those who have taken measures, he adds, incorporate practices such as staff training and tenant collaboration into their corporate culture.
Scott Rouse, managing partner of Energy@Work, which advises companies on shaving energy and utility costs, puts a premium on training front-line operators.
Of 27 Toronto-area buildings his company tracks for energy performance, four are not hitting their targets.
"Success depends on having a process, energy management products and trained people in place," he says. "Often not hitting a target can come down to people issues because of inadequate training, not the process or products."
One of his clients, Torontobased Crown Property Management Inc., a commercial real estate investment and management firm, took advantage of then-available incentives from Toronto Hydro to map out an energy management "action plan."
For low and no-cost savings, the company revised schedules for lighting, heating and cooling, but also carried out formal energy audits. Building operators received regular training and over time, unprompted, spotted other cost savings. As a result, eight of the company's Toronto-area buildings cut kilowatt hour usage by 21 per cent over the past two years, as verified by Toronto Hydro.
"It is an awesome achievement when we save anything," says Gary Summers, partner, operations and construction for Crown. "It allows us to put more [of] our resources towards managing our tenants and working with them to stay."
At Allied, the company in 2018 introduced a "sustainable well-being program," with tools for benchmarking energy, water and waste performance; regular staff training; and tenant engagement strategies.
"It starts with measurement and benchmarking," says Powell Talverdi, director of capital projects for Allied. "We want to know where we stand with energy and water consumption in each property: How do we compare against the industry? Where are the opportunities to improve? And when we do fall behind, we can understand what is happening."
When the company combined its own spending and government incentives to retrofit 13 buildings with LED lighting, the investment repaid itself in less than two years, with an average 60-per-cent drop in lighting consumption.
In seven Toronto buildings, where electric baseboard heaters typically ran all winter, including on weekends, Allied installed smart controls to adjust for outside temperatures and indoor occupancy. With the new controls, the heat was off 77 per cent of the time, mostly during unoccupied hours.
Allied is currently installing automation systems in two large buildings to enable heating, cooling and other systems to communicate with each other to improve operational efficiency.
Tenant engagement is part of the overall strategy, says Barbara Ciesla, Allied's vice-president of experience. With tenants, she says, "we form a ‘council of occupiers' who work with us and inform the process. They let us know their objectives on sustainability and we share ours."
On recycling, lighting reduction and other conservation campaigns, Ms. Ciesla says Allied and its 240 tenant organizations across Canada participate in "Partners for Sustainable Wellbeing" sessions, with the building owner and tenants committing to activities with collective impact.
"We try to include behavioural science into the campaigns, with incentives to start a [positive] behaviour and social norms to bring [tenants] together and share what each other is doing," she says.
Government incentives speed up the payback period for conservation measures, but tenant satisfaction and leasing rate premiums also factor into the calculation.
"Whether there are incentives or not, there is clearly a business case to do energy efficiency projects," says Bala Gnanam, vicepresident of energy, environment and advocacy for the Building Owners and Managers Association (BOMA) of the Greater Toronto Area, which participates in a national environmental and certification program for existing buildings.
In Ontario, the Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO) agency that oversees the province's electricity market, currently offers $141-million in retrofit incentives. But industry applications are lagging, possibly because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Energy conservation "is the cheapest resource we have," says Terry Young, vice-president of policy, engagement and innovation at IESO. The agency estimates that, since 2015, its retrofit program has saved 4.2 terawatt hours of electricity savings, more than annual use by the city of London, Ont.
Industry veterans see no "silver bullet" for building retrofits.
BOMA Toronto chair-elect David Hoffman, the former general manager of the TD Centre (the first property in North America to produce a building-level sustainability report in 2013), cites targetsetting and reporting, training, effective operational practices and occupant engagement as ingredients for success.
"It is not a sprint, it is a long marathon," says Mr. Hoffman, general manager of CIBC Square, a downtown Toronto office complex now under development.
With the clock ticking on climate change pledges, many see the pandemic as an opportunity to redouble retrofit efforts that, by definition, would spur local employment and economic recovery.
"The amount of buildings we are retrofitting is well under 1 per cent of the existing building stock," says Brendan Haley, policy director for Efficiency Canada, which advocates for an energy-efficient economy. By contrast, some European countries have set a target of 3 per cent a year.
"We need to increase the rate of buildings done per year, but also the depth of the energy savings in the retrofits and move those buildings to low-carbon emission systems," he says.
Even more blunt is Robert Sroufe, a business sustainability professor at Duquesne University and co-author of The Power of Existing Buildings.
"Commercial building owners who think they are not part of the problem might be part of the pollution," he warns. "If they want to differentiate their companies, they need to invest in existing buildings and show they are places and spaces that people want to be in."

Full text: 208 Rose Park Dr., Toronto MOORE PARK Asking price: $2,580,000 Selling price: $2,635,000 Previous selling price: $1,260,000 (2013) Taxes: $11,305 (2019) Days on the market: Three Listing agents: Jim Warren, Doug Gubitz and Christopher Killam, Chestnut Park Real Estate Ltd.
THE ACTION The agents spent two weeks preparing the marketing material for this two-storey duplex on a 34-by-143-foot lot, from professional photography to home inspections. But one of the earliest visitors produced an offer so quickly after launch in February that further tours were unnecessary.
"There was one [property] on St. Clair that was on the fall market and was relisted for $50,000 less than a week and a half before we went on and it sold for full price. So it was a good indication there was strength in the market," agent Jim Warren said.
"The [buyer] decided to come up with [an] offer that came in over asking because they wanted to close the deal."
WHAT THEY GOT This and five other duplexes were built in the 1930s on this quiet street near Moorevale Park and Moore Park Ravine.
Over 2013-14, renovations created two stylish two-bedroom suites.
Each suite has a gas fireplace in the living room, a private outdoor space and parking. The main floor unit is somewhat larger than the upper unit, having an additional office, recreation room and secondary bathroom in the basement.
THE AGENT'S TAKE "It was completely renovated and gutted, so everything was new, except for three original windows," Mr. Warren said.
"It was the perfect opportunity for a young family or downsizers who wanted a nice place with great income."
Local attractions sweetened the deal. "You could walk to Yonge [Street] and one of the best schools in Toronto - Whitney Jr.
[Public School]," Mr. Warren said.
"And it's on a nice tree-lined street near the ravine system."

Alternative mortgage lender suspends redemptions amid pandemic uncertainty

Full text: Westboro Mortgage Investment LP has suspended redemptions, the latest alternative lender to stop investors from taking their money out because of the tumult from the coronavirus pandemic.
"Given the current lack of visibility on the severity and duration of the economic downturn, our management team has concluded that it is in the best interest of the fund and all fund investors to temporarily suspend redemptions for a period of time," Westboro said in a letter to investors obtained by The Globe and Mail.
The Ottawa-based lender mostly provides residential loans in Southern and Eastern Ontario and its portfolio holds more than 800 mortgages, according to its website.
"There have been no redemptions paid out since the crisis began. It was determined that the temporary suspension will protect the long-term interests of all unitholders during this period of economic uncertainty and limit the effects of the pandemic," the letter said.
Westboro did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Westboro is one of hundreds of mortgage investment corporations that have blossomed as demand for real estate has soared. Although alternative mortgage providers have been around for decades, the number has spiked since the Great Recession as rising prices and stricter bank underwriting standards have made it harder for some home buyers to qualify for a loan from a bank. As well, demand from investors increased as they expected to get a higher return with real estate-related assets.
Mortgage investment corporations pool funds from individual investors and those funds are used to provide loans to real estate borrowers.
However, the slowdown in the economy has prompted some real estate and debt funds to halt redemptions. That includes two of the country's largest private debt funds, Bridging Finance Inc. and Romspen Investment Corp. Romspen said it was reasonable to assume that distributions will be reduced.
As well, Vancouver-based Trez Capital, which provides mortgages to commercial real estate developers, froze redemptions on more than $3-billion of investors' assets. And Canada Life Assurance Co. has temporarily halted all investor activity on its Canadian real estate funds.
The huge loss of employment has increased the risk that more homeowners will default on their mortgage payments, which would reduce returns for all lenders. Since the end of April, the country's biggest banks have provided mortgage deferrals for more than 700,000 Canadians.
The national housing agency, Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp., has estimated that 10 per cent of homeowners with a CMHC-insured mortgage have deferred payments.
Westboro said it would continue to pay its regular annualized 6.5-per-cent dividend for April. "There has been no indication of a decrease in real estate values, but it is very early and the fallout from the current lockdown on the housing market is unknown," the letter said.
"We are monitoring the return on a monthly basis and will notify investors of required changes to the advance rate in future months."
Home sales in Ottawa, Vancouver and Toronto have dropped precipitously in April, but overall prices have remained steady or increased. In Ottawa, the average selling price of a residential property increased 7 per cent over the previous year, according to the local real estate board.

Full text: Home sales in Vancouver, Calgary and Toronto plunged in April, according to local real estate boards, as the COVID-19 pandemic closed businesses and led to mass layoffs across the country.
In the Vancouver region, 1,109 homes sold last month, a 40-percent drop over last year and a near four-decade low.
In Calgary, where the housing market had started to rebound from the 2015 oil crash and recession, sales fell 63 per cent to 573 properties.
And in the Toronto area, the largest residential market in the country, 2,975 homes sold, down 67 per cent compared with the previous year, with condo sales recording the steepest drop, at 72 per cent.
Although real estate work is deemed essential in British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario, physical-distancing requirements and fear of contracting the virus that causes COVID-19 kept home buyers from viewing and purchasing property.
"Home buyers were taking a pause, saying, ‘Whoa, what's going on. Let's see where this will go,' " said Elton Ash, Re/Max's regional director for Western Canada.
Sales started falling off a cliff mid-March when the provinces restricted activity and implored residents to stay at home. As well, regional real estate boards warned realtors against holding open houses, and banks started tightening their underwriting standards for borrowers.
Despite the steep drop in activity, home prices rose in the Vancouver region in April. The composite benchmark price, an industry metric, for all types of residential properties in the Vancouver area was $1,036,000 last month. That was 2.5 per cent higher than April of last year and the third straight month of yearover-year increases.
The prices continued to rise as the number of new listings continued to fall, decreasing 60 per cent in April compared with last year.
"Home sellers became very uncomfortable with having people come into their homes," Mr. Ash said.
In Calgary, the number of new listings fell by 50 per cent. But the inventory of homes for sale remained elevated, contributing to an 8-per-cent drop in the average selling price across all types of homes to $422,655, according to the Calgary Real Estate Board.
With the rout in oil prices crippling the province's economy, the board said it expected challenges in the housing market to "persist throughout this year."
In the Toronto region, new listings sank 64 per cent. Price increases in attached houses and townhouses offset decreases in condos and detached houses. The average selling price for an attached house rose 7 per cent compared with last year, while condos fell 1.7 per cent and detached houses slumped by 3.5 per cent, according to the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board.
Over all, the average selling price across all types of residential real estate rose 0.1 per cent to $821,392.
"There has continued to be enough active buyers relative to available listings to keep prices in line with last year's levels," said the board's chief market analyst Jason Mercer in a statement accompanying the results.
Since last year, the Toronto and Vancouver housing markets have been recovering from the slowdown from the stricter mortgage rules and taxes on foreign buyers.
Until mid-March, those markets were starting to overheat with properties receiving multiple offers over the asking price. Today, there is less competition among buyers, but also fewer properties for sale.
The number of people who entered into new agreements to rent one-bedroom and two-bedroom condos fell more than 50 per cent last month, while the average rent for a one bedroom was down nearly 3 per cent to $2,107, according to the Toronto Real Estate Board.
Residential sales are expected to fall in May even though the real estate industry has been forced to embrace technology that allows homeowners to show their homes virtually and the popular five-year fixed mortgage is slightly lower than it was at the end of March.

Full text: 26 Biggar Ave.
TORONTO Asking Price: $2.199-million Taxes: $6,455 (2019) Lot Size: 40 feet by 141 feet Agents: Josie Stern and Valerie Benchitrit, Sutton Group Associates Realty Inc.
THE BACKSTORY Aubrey Spring used to walk to work with his two sons when he taught elementary classes at Humewood Community School in the early 2000s. Every morning, his wife left their house and cycled in the other direction to her medical practice just south of Christie and Bloor Streets. Their short commutes to work usually took longer than expected.
"Any time you walk around our community, you see some friends," Mr. Spring said. "It's inevitable to stop and talk to parents and students and people you know."
And most people in the Hillcrest Village neighbourhood, just south of St. Clair Avenue West, knew the Springs. They were the family of four in the three-storey home on 26 Biggar Ave. with a rink behind it - one that was kept clean and flooded in winter so that the kids in the community could come and skate. Their big brick home was every young family's dream - there was ample parking, a close-by grocery store and more than enough space to play in and around the house.
But now, 20 years later, keeping up that space is at times cumbersome for Mr. and Ms. Springs.
The children - now grown men - have moved out, and the six-bedroom house with three finished floors is too big for two emptynesters.
"It's going to be hard to leave this place," Mr. Spring said.
"There are great memories. I feel so comfortable here, but it is a big home."
THE HOUSE TODAY The house, built in 1912, is a busy combination of charming heritage elements and modern additions. The ceilings are high, the living-room wallpaper is vintage yellow and green and the floors, pocket doors and entire staircase are all gracefully aging hardwood.
When the Springs bought the home in 1997 and became only its second owners, they stripped layers of linoleum and broadloom off the floors and walls, in the process revealing intricate patterns of woodwork.
Since then, they've redone the kitchen to allow for more sunlight and a view of the backyard.
They opened up the dining-room area to have more space to entertain extended family and friends.
And they added two solar panels to the roof shortly after buying the house.
"We were sort of pioneers when we got those installed," Mr. Spring said.
Their most prized renovation piece is the main bathroom - the Springs refer to it as the powder room - where they had a Toto toilet installed with heated seats and a built-in bidet function.
"We had been to Japan in 2012 and fell in love with their toilets," Mr. Spring said with a laugh.
Their time in Asia also inspired a backyard makeover. By then, the children were older and less interested in skating, so the Springs transformed the rink space into a garden, which was professionally designed and landscaped by local gardening guru Marjorie Harris. Shades of green, purple and red shrubbery surround rows of growing vegetables.
"My wife is a big veggie grower," Mr. Spring said. "I get out to prune and weed."
A path of cement tiles follows the green space and leads to a three-door garage, a rare sight in Toronto. The Springs rarely used three cars, but a space to store cars could come in handy to new buyers, should they choose to take full advantage of the property. The home's lot includes plans for building a 1,400-square-foot, two-storey laneway house next to it, useful for when a teenager wants to move out - or when an elderly parent wants to move closer - and does not want to spend millions on another property in the city.
"For a growing family," Mr. Spring said, "this place has a lot of potential."
SELLING IN A PANDEMIC Yet, trying to sell a house in the thick of the COVID-19 crisis comes with its inherent challenges. So far, Mr. Spring has left his home each time a potential buyer has visited, and has prepared the place to be viewed and not touched.
"If someone comes in," he says, "we leave all the lights on and closets open so that nobody has to touch anything."
Real estate agent Josie Stern has organized one-person-at-a time viewings and ensures that potential clients and agents wear a mask and gloves. She says that while most clients have put their moving plans on hold during the pandemic, 26 Biggar has already had five viewings in the 10 days it has been on the market.
"As it turns out, this is a really good pandemic house," Ms. Stern said. "People want this space when working from home - here they don't have to be crammed in a basement. Some of these bedrooms could be turned into a nice office with great lighting."
On top of the in-person viewings, Ms. Stern has offered virtual tours of the house through Zoom, Facebook and Instagram.
Her business partner, Valerie Benchitrit, methodically went through the exterior and the interior of the house using her phone to showcase each room and feature.
Ms. Stern is confident the house will sell for its originally listed price of $2.199-million. Before the pandemic, she tended to underlist houses to elicit interest and create bidding wars between clients. But that strategy, while still used by some agents, does not hold during periods of physical distancing, she said.
For now, Ms. Stern is selective about which clients get to visit the property.
"People who come in are serious buyers, and are not ‘just looking,' " she said. "That's why we are sticking with a price we think is fair. The house's charm with the wood is quite rare and it's beautifully maintained."
While Mr. Spring is upset to part ways with his home, he is confident that it will go to appreciative hands.
"It's got the space and the neighbourhood vibe that a growing family would appreciate ... it's something we loved about it."

Commercial tenants, landlords say rent-relief plan lacks clarity

Full text: With May's rent due at the end of the week, commercial property tenants and landlords are confused over Ottawa's rent assistance because the scant details about the program have left them unsure of whether they are eligible and for how much.
Tenants and their landlords are uncertain over a raft of requirements, including whether the $50,000 monthly rent cap is for the base rent or gross rent, which includes shared operating costs such as maintenance and realty taxes.
Under the Canada Emergency Commercial Rent Assistance program unveiled Friday, property owners could apply to the country's housing agency for taxpayer funds that would cover half of its distressed tenant's rent for April, May and June. The landlord and the tenant would each be responsible for one-quarter of the total rent.
The landlord is eligible for the funds if its tenant has lost a minimum of 70 per cent of its revenue and the monthly rent is $50,000 or less.
"I don't know if the landlord will apply or not," said Kerry Warnaar, owner of Jungle Oasis, an indoor playground in Orangeville, Ont., whose revenue fell to zero in mid-March when the province shut non-essential work to slow the spread of the coronavirus.
Although Ms. Warnaar and other small businesses welcomed Ottawa's support, the rent relief program lacks details. Ms. Warnaar worries about whether the operating costs are included. She said her monthly base rent is $4,786 but the gross rent, including all additional fees, is $10,113.08.
For businesses with multiple locations, they do not know whether the $50,000 cap is per location or across their entire portfolio. Another source of confusion is whether a property owner without a mortgage can apply for the relief, as the federal Finance Department's website specifies a "mortgaged property owner." But the Finance Department told The Globe late on Monday that the assistance will be available to commercial property owners who don't have a mortgage.
Another source of confusion is whether a property owner can apply on behalf of one tenant or whether the landlord will have to submit an application for the entire building, which could mean the entire building would get a break on rent.
"The main concern that I am hearing from our clients, is that the landlord may be reluctant to enroll in the program out of fear of losing the 25 per cent from their office tenants or those tenants that have the ability to pay," said Stan Krawitz, vice-chairman with commercial real estate company Savills Canada, who represents tenants of all sizes.
"There is no clarity on whether the landlord can apply on a tenant-by-tenant basis or buildingby-building basis."
In response to Globe questions on Monday, Ottawa repeated that it would unveil more details in coming days. It has said the program will be up and running by mid-May.
For Jungle Oasis, the difference in monthly payments between subsidizing rent and subsidizing all related costs alongside it is more than $3,500. "I don't want to go further into debt because of this," said Ms. Warnaar, who has already taken out an interest-free $40,000 Canada Emergency Business Account loan. "The stress of not knowing is what's so upsetting to me."
Ms. Warnaar's April rent was deferred. She is waiting to hear back from her property manager and does not know what she has to pay when rent is due Friday. "I don't know if I will have to pay $10,000," she said.
Landlords big and small have said they are open to applying for the subsidy and taking the 25per-cent reduction to pass the savings to their tenants.
Joel Posluns just paid off the commercial loan for his building in North Vancouver in March.
He's semi-retired and uses it as an income property and, in normal times, teaches aikido in one of the units. Because he has no mortgage on the property, he believes he's ineligible to apply for the forgivable loan to pass on savings to tenants, which include a local comic, toy and game shop called Big Pete's Collectibles.
"It seems to me that this program is more aimed at keeping the commercial lending portfolios of the banks whole, at the expense of small landlords like myself," he said.
In April, big retail landlords such as Ivanhoé Cambridge, RioCan REIT and SmartCentres REIT offered rent deferrals for some of their hardest-hit tenants. SmartCentres has said it is open to taking the 25-per-cent reduction for some of its tenants.

Alberta's Heritage Fund hit hard by AIMCo's bad bet

Full text: Significant losses at Alberta's government-owned money manager have dealt a major setback to the province's flagship Heritage Fund.
Amid unprecedented swings in the market owing to the impact of the COVID-19 virus, Alberta Investment Management Corp. (AIMCo) lost an estimated $4-billion in recent weeks on derivatives, investments that pay off only if stock prices remain stable, according to sources at AIMCo clients. This is in addition to other losses on its stocks, bonds and real estate. The money manager oversees 31 provincial pension plans and endowments and has a portfolio of $119-billion.
The Globe and Mail disclosed the losses on Wednesday and is not naming the people because they are not authorized to speak about AIMCo's performance.
Some AIMCo clients, including the $50-billion Local Authorities Pension Plan, and the $4.8-billion Universities Academic Pension Plan, told AIMCo to limit their exposure to strategies tied to market volatility, or use more than one investment manager. As a result, these plans expect to be spared from some of the fallout from AIMCo's poor performance.
But the $18-billion Alberta Heritage Savings Trust Fund, which was built from oil and gas royalties, is 100 per cent managed by AIMCo, and was fully exposed to the fund manager's strategies, resulting in a significant loss in March and April, sources said.
Income from the Heritage fund - $43-billion since it was founded in 1976 - is earmarked for public projects such as schools and hospitals.
Earlier this year, Alberta Premier Jason Kenney proposed moving Alberta's contribution to the Canada Pension Plan into the Edmonton-based AIMCo. The provincial government also announced plans last year to move the independently run, $18-billion Alberta teachers' pension plan into AIMCo.
Mr. Kenney said the idea of moving Alberta's CPP funds is not based on AIMCo's investment strategies, but the fact that the contributions are a net transfer of wealth outside the province.
"It's quite reasonable for Albertans to ask whether we'd be better off and be able to operate a public pension plan with lower premiums that would help us to create more jobs while keeping those returns here in Alberta," he told reporters on Wednesday.
He said the question would be addressed when the health crisis is over and after a report is released from a panel studying whether federal programs serve Alberta well.
Critics pointed to AIMCo's losses as a reason to abandon any notion of expanding the fund manager.
Rachel Notley, leader of the opposition NDP and former premier, said she was troubled to learn that "specific management decisions" have made the stock market crash worse for AIMCo, and called for more information on the losses.
"This is a clear message to Jason Kenney and [Finance Minister] Travis Toews to stop all talk of forcing Albertans to put their CPP money into AIMCo, and also they should stop all talk of forcing the teachers to put their pension money into AIMCo," Ms. Notley said.
On Wednesday, Jerrica Goodwin, spokeswoman for Mr. Toews, said AIMCo's volatility-based strategy was put in place before the UCP government was elected a year ago. She also said the Crown corporation makes its investment decisions independent of the government. She declined to comment on whether the strategy's level of risk was acceptable.
"We understand AIMCo has been briefing its clients and will continue to do so," Ms. Goodwin said in an e-mail. "The minister has been briefed and will be receiving updates as AIMCo conducts its review, and will scrutinize that review.
"The Premier has been very clear that any hypothetical change to an Alberta pension plan would be put to a democratic referendum to be voted on by Albertans," Ms. Goodwin said. "In any event, no decision has been made on whether to even try pursuing an Alberta pension plan."
Last year, the Kenney government passed legislation that will put the pensions of the province's teachers under the umbrella of AIMCo. The Alberta Teachers' Association (ATA) has been staunchly against the move, arguing that its current manager, the Alberta Teachers Retirement Fund (ATRF) has provided aboveaverage returns for its retirees for decades and gives members a say in investment strategies.
Jason Schilling, president of the ATA, said AIMCo's loss has only added to teachers' fears of being exposed to higher risk after the shift, which is due to be completed at the end of 2021.
"What we have out of the Globe and Mail article that was released yesterday was kind of teachers' worst fears," Mr. Schilling said. "I know that teachers have been contacting MLAs, they've been phoning them, they've been e-mailing, they've been trying to impress on them that they still have time to repeal Bill 22."
The union will express concerns to the government as well, he said.
The teachers' fund said in a statement that it is working to ensure its members are not exposed to "extreme risk" as it transfers administration to AIMCo.
"We are concerned about the additional losses that AIMCo clients are incurring as a result of a specific strategy," ATRF chief executive officer Rod Matheson said in the statement. "We have focused on setting up the relationship with AIMCo in a way that protects the interests of our plans and plan members, and this is a good reminder for us of the importance of that work."

Toronto home sales drop nearly 70% in first half of April compared with last year

Full text: Toronto home sales tumbled in the first half of April, down 69 per cent compared with the previous year, as the coronavirus pandemic led to an economic slowdown and a huge spike in unemployment.
In the first 17 days of this month, 1,654 homes sold in the Toronto region compared with 5,343 in the same period last year, according to the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board (TRREB).
That followed the 16-per-cent decline in sales in the latter part of March, when federal and local governments clamped down on non-essential work and urged Canadians to maintain a physical distance from each other when out in public.
"Home buyers and sellers have concerns about the economy and indeed their own employment situations," the board's president Michael Collins said in a statement accompanying the results.
"On top of this, many buyers and sellers are avoiding any type of in-person interaction," he said.
The mid-month report provides the first comprehensive look at the state of the country's largest real estate market during the government shutdowns.
Although sales started deteriorating after mid-March, open houses were still taking place and many realtors were completing transactions that occurred earlier in the year.
The Canadian Real Estate Association has said preliminary data from the first week of this month suggest sales and new property listings across the country were only about half of what would be normal for that time of the year.
In the Toronto region, condo sales declined the most, falling 72 per cent year over year.
TRREB, which typically reports activity once a month, said condos traditionally attract a high share of first-time buyers, who in times of uncertainty can put their decision to purchase on hold.
Sales of detached houses more than $2-million also decreased, which pulled down the average selling price.
Over all, the average selling price across all types of homes fell by 1.5 per cent to $819,665 from $832,430 a year ago.
Meanwhile, the number of new property listings fell in lockstep with the number of sales, down 64 per cent to 3,843.
The board called the drop in sales temporary and predicted that activity would accelerate once the economic recovery begins.
The housing market in Toronto and Southern Ontario had been overheating in the months leading to March with a shortage of properties for sale driving up competition, multiple offers and deals well more than the asking price.

Full text: Alberta's government-owned money manager has lost more than $4-billion on what clients are calling a wrong-way bet against sharp swings in stock prices, dealing a heavy financial blow to a province already reeling from falling oil prices and the COVID-19 pandemic.
Alberta Investment Management Corp., known as AIMCo, suffered far larger losses than comparable funds after investing in contracts that pay off only if stock markets remain stable. It lost billions of dollars when the economic collapse wrought by COVID-19 sent the S&P 500 and other stock benchmarks on a roller coaster ride, putting it on the losing end of the trades, according to several senior pension plan officials and other sources who are familiar with the situation.
The Globe is not naming the people because they aren't authorized to speak publicly about AIMCo's investing strategies.
The Edmonton-based Crown corporation manages about $119billion on behalf of 375,000 members of provincial public retirement programs as well as public accounts such as the province's $18-billion Heritage Savings Trust Fund. With investment decisions that affect pension beneficiaries as well as Alberta taxpayers, the loss raises questions about whether the strategy was too risky.
The sources said that AIMCo now acknowledges its executives were not fully aware of the risks they were taking.
A $4-billion loss would equate to more than a third of AIMCo's 2019 net investment income of $11.5-billion.
AIMCo's hit on volatilitybased investment strategies came on top of a sharp drop in the value of its traditional equity, bond and real estate investments in March, when virtually every investor lost money. The average Canadian pension plan lost 8.7 per cent of its value in the first three months of this year, according to consulting firm Mercer. When it formally reports quarterly results to clients later this month, AIMCo is expected to be down far more than this.
AIMCo declined to discuss details of its investing strategies.
However, its director of corporate communications, Denes Nemeth, said it has not breached any internal or external rules or regulations related to the risk it can take on as a fund manager acting on behalf of pensioners and government accounts.
"The level of volatility that markets experienced in March, 2020, the result of the COVID-19 pandemic, during which volatility rose faster, and on a more sustained basis than at any other time in history, is exceptional," Mr. Nemeth said in an e-mail.
"AIMCo acknowledges that it is not immune to the challenges, unique as they may be, that institutional investors around the world have experienced."
AIMCo executives have kept clients apprised of the market conditions' impact on investment performance, he said.
Markets were relatively placid in recent years, and clients said AIMCo made consistent 6-percent to 7-per-cent returns on the volatility strategy, which is meant to be a low-risk way of generating dependable results that are not linked to the performance of public market investments such as stocks or bonds.
AIMCo's past returns on the strategy are now overshadowed by losses on the unprecedented moves in stock prices that played out in March, when volatility reached all-time highs, exceeding records set in the 1929 stock market crash.
AIMCo told clients in early April it is terminating the money-losing approach. However, some of its contracts with institutions such as global investment banks will not expire until June.
The sources said AIMCo already booked about $2-billion in losses in March on this one strategy, and expects $2-billion or more in additional losses as the remainder of its contracts expire, although calmer markets could reduce that.
AIMCo's results are known in the industry because it reports to clients every three months, while most other plans disclose performance numbers once a year, or semi-annually.
Sheri Wright, vice-president of the Edmonton-based Local Authorities Pension Plan, known as LAPP, would not discuss specific investments, but said plan officials were briefed on the impact of the market meltdown in early April.
AIMCo invests $50-billion on behalf of LAPP's 275,000 members, who include Alberta's hospital workers and other current and retired government employees.
"We have heard from AIMCo, in a preliminary reporting, that the first-quarter report is likely to show significant losses as a result of the severe market volatility that characterized the first few months of 2020, in reaction to COVID-19," Ms. Wright said.
"AIMCo is fully aware, and we communicate to them on a regular basis, that our risk tolerances are as much a reflection of our pension obligations as the need for positive investment gains," she said.
Alberta regulations require LAPP to use AIMCo as its fund manager. The pension plan has flagged poor performance as a problem for many years, noting in its most recent report that "AIMCo has been short of LAPP's value-added expectations for 46 consecutive quarters, or 11 years and 6 months."
Other clients gave AIMCo qualified support. The fund manager oversees $150-million for the city of Medicine Hat, and city controller Dennis Egert said AIMCo provided a recent update on its performance. In an e-mail, Mr. Egert said: "We appreciate the unique COVID-19 impact on the financial markets, however, we also appreciate the nature and behaviours of the capital markets."
Early this month, AIMCo reported a return of 10.6 per cent for its 30 pension-plan, endowment and government clients in 2019. It warned in its report that 2020 would be "unparalleled" because of the impact of COVID-19 and the oil price crash on all asset values. AIMCo warned it was dealing with "a period of sudden and unprecedented volatility" in investment markets.
"Our team is responding decisively in an effort to protect our clients' liquidity and assets in the near and medium term, while still identifying longer-term investment opportunities that will come out of these challenging market circumstances," chief executive officer Kevin Uebelein said in a statement announcing the 2019 results.
Investment industry experts are warning pension plan members to brace for a shock when they see recent performance numbers, and focus on their long-term goals. Andrew Whale, a principal at Mercer, said in a recent report: "There is no doubt that funded positions are down and almost every defined-benefit plan will feel this economic and public health crisis, but we're optimistic that plan sponsors can avoid a pension crisis with smart and strategic decision-making."
AIMCo has been at the centre of controversy over the past year.
Union leaders and Alberta's opposition NDP opposed legislation passed by Premier Jason Kenney's UCP government in late 2019 that brought teachers' pensions under the AIMCo umbrella.
The government said the move was aimed at saving taxpayer dollars.
The Alberta Teachers' Association has argued that its members have been well served by the Alberta Teachers' Retirement Fund, which has managed their pensions for decades and has modelled itself on the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan. The transition is not due to be completed until the end of 2021, so AIMCo's loss does not affect Alberta's teachers and retirees.

Full text: One of the most highly valued startups to launch from Canada in the past decade, travel accommodation provider Sonder Holdings Inc., is closing in on a nine-figure financing investors believe will help it ride out the economic impact of the pandemic.
Sources familiar with the situation told The Globe and Mail that Sonder, an alternative to Airbnb Inc. and traditional hotels, has closed almost US$100-million of an intended venture capital funding of between US$150-million and $200million, valuing it at roughly US$1.1-billion prior to the receipt of funds. That is unchanged from the valuation Sonder, which moved to San Francisco from Montreal in 2016, attained after raising US$225-million in 2019.
Observers say that is a considerable feat considering the dire state of the global hospitality trade. Some Sonder rivals, including Stay Alfred, have suspended operations or cut staff since travel largely ground to a halt in March. The Globe is not identifying the sources because they are not authorized to speak publicly about the deal.
Sonder in March laid off 22 per cent of its roughly 1,250 staff and furloughed another 11 per cent, largely sparing its Canadian operation, where 15 of 162 people were affected. Sonder also wrung $20-million in concessions from landlords.
But existing investors were willing to put more into a technology-enabled hospitality company they believe has the right strategy and team to emerge from the crisis in better shape than its rivals, sources say.
Sonder's Canadian founder and chief executive officer, Francis Davidson, declined to confirm any details of the financing, which the market has been expecting, after comments he and at least one investor have made to U.S. media indicating the company was talking to investors about raising an unspecified amount. "We're really happy to ... continue to have the support of investors, but we're not ready to comment on any kind of capital raises at this time," he said in an interview.
Mr. Davidson did say that Sonder, which has raised more than US$350-million to date, had started the year intending to raise up to US$200-million in 2020.
Mr. Davidson launched the company in 2012 after his freshman year at McGill University, renting his Montreal apartment to travellers to earn extra money, while also valeting their cars and providing bottles of wine to guests.
The next summer the Gatineau native managed vacant apartments for several students; by 2014 he was generating $1-million in revenue and quit school. He raised $5-million from Canadian backers in 2015, including Business Development Bank of Canada and Real Ventures, and has since added big-name U.S. investors including Greylock Partners, Spark Capital, Valor Equity Partners, Greenoaks Capital, Fidelity Investments and Canada's iNovia Capital.
Sonder's growth plan differed from Airbnb as it sought to lease directly from real estate companies, giving it more control over spaces and furnishings. It targeted digitally savvy millennials seeking "authentic" experiences. Forgoing costly amenities such as room service, front desks and gyms, it provided keyless entry to rooms appointed like hip boutique hotels, scattered in buildings in cosmopolitan neighbourhoods in cities across Canada, the U.S. and Europe. Sonder instead offered "digital concierge" services to guests through their phones, connecting them digitally to local services such as food delivery.
By 2018, Sonder had figured out the unit economics of its model and stepped up expansion efforts, leasing more than 1,000 rooms a quarter, up from less than 400.
Sonder ended 2019 with 14,000 rooms under contract, up from 4,000 a year earlier, and had 5,000 properties available for guest bookings at the end of February. It was generating US$260-million in annualized revenue and taking over management of boutique hotels where it could bring its economies of scale to bear. Its imminent plans included selling copies of the art and furnishings in rooms to guests, reaching profitability and gearing up to go public in the next few years, Mr. Davidson said.
Plans changed in February. In addition to cost-cutting efforts and curtailing expansion, Sonder slashed rates by 45 per cent and marketed its properties as temporary shelters for health care workers, displaced students and stranded travellers. That helped it reach nearly 50-per-cent occupancy, although revenue for each room is expected to drop by 50 per cent to 70 per cent in April.
Mr. Davidson anticipates a "difficult and deep and long recession" that could last two or more years. "But," he added, "at the same time this might be one of the best opportunities" to add properties. Amid the crisis, "it's probably one of the most important moments for our business model to shine."

Full text: Property manager John Butler is one of many on the front lines caring for commercial buildings suddenly emptied by the COVID-19 pandemic.
"It wasn't that things slowed down for me," says Mr. Butler, property maintenance supervisor for WTC1 Inc., which manages more than 200,000 square feet of commercial space in Waterloo, Ont.
"It was that things got busier."
As for everyone, the deadly coronavirus has upended daily routines in the commercial real estate sector over the past month. In response to an invisible enemy, property owners and managers are rewriting their playbooks to protect buildings now and prepare them for reoccupancy after an all-clear signal from governments.
"We did have pandemic plans and business continuity plans in place pre-COVID-19," says Neil Lacheur, executive vice-president of real estate management services in Canada for Avison Young, a global commercial real estate firm. But when building occupancy plummeted from near 100 per cent to 10 per cent in mid-March as tenants relocated to work from home, he says "we did have to adapt significantly on the fly because of the speed with which this [virus] came about."
An immediate issue was the redeployment of cleaning staff.
Without tenants on site, janitors could clean offices faster than normal (sometimes in the day instead of at night) and redirect their efforts to disinfect highpriority common areas where visitors enter a building. Other staff, who typically respond to repair and other requests from tenants, could increase the time devoted to preventive maintenance.
"The buildings are still open, and we are still responsible for protecting the owners' assets and the assets of tenants," Mr. Lacheur says.
As a result, property management companies report a small drop in the number of cleaning staff - and no decline in security guards.
But public-health rules on physical distancing have prompted changes in staff schedules.
At Jones Lang Lasalle Inc., whose commercial real estate activities include property management, shifts for janitorial staff and others were staggered so they were not in close contact with each other.
"We are trying to keep the social- and physical-distancing rules as best we can and where they [cleaners] have to work together they are in full personal protective equipment," says Ron Fiell, vice-president of national practice, lead property management for JLL. In his company's coronavirus response, front-desk security staff pose health and safety questions to contractors and others before they enter a building.
One thin silver lining of the empty-building phenomenon is the enhanced opportunity for preventive maintenance.
"Now there are buildings where 85 per cent of the lights are out and we can work on making the building more efficient," says Mr. Fiell, such as checking on the optimal operation of energy systems. "There is technology we have in place in some buildings for some of this equipment that we can tweak as we go," he says.
"Now they [property managers] have this opportunity to really dig in and find those efficiencies." With buildings in enforced "hibernation," as one industry official puts it, the legal obligations of landlords and tenants are unchanged, says Yan Besner, a Montreal partner in the real estate practice of Osler, Hoskin & Harcourt LLP.
"You need to make sure you keep the property on proper life support so that when things go back to normal, whatever that new normal may be, that the lights can be proverbially turned out again without a hitch," he says. Property owners and tenants with buildings in multiple provinces, he adds, need to fulfill their respective contractual obligations while keeping abreast of virus-related government directives.
"Hopefully, there is going to be a lot of good-faith understanding between both sides coming out of this," he says.
To that end, effective communication is proving to be a valuable lesson in managing the current disruption.
"We had to stay steady and consistent in our communication, so people felt that sense of comfort that everything was being taken care of and their health and well-being was covered," says Avison Young's Mr. Lacheur, who described his company as being "in overdrive" to communicate to its tenants and investor clients.
Internal communications are no less important.
Early last month, two days before the National Basketball Association cancelled games because of the virus, Avison Young set up internal teams at its global, North American, Canadian and local levels to share information and solve problems. "We kept very clear channels throughout the organization so people did not feel like they had to develop their own solutions," he said. "Everything flowed upstream and downstream."
Another lesson, industry officials say, is an emergency response plan that is ready to go, not dormant on a shelf.
"What this [virus] scenario has highlighted is the importance of keeping it [the plan] operational and not just operational within an organization or building but across the neighbourhood, the community and between buildings," says Bala Gnanam, vice-president of energy, environment and advocacy for the Building Owners and Managers Association of the Greater Toronto Area.
Two weeks ago, in response to the swift emptying of office towers, BOMA Toronto released a sixpage checklist developed by one of its industry-member advisory councils to identify issues - from security to daily digital technology inspections - triggered by "building extended closure."
A previous version of the checklist was "completely revamped for the COVID-19 scenario," says Mr. Gnanam, whose organization is holding coronavirus webinars for its members.
Back in Waterloo, Mr. Butler still starts his day at 7 a.m., but much of his daily schedule has been revised by the pandemic.
Without repair requests coming from tenants, he now enters their empty offices to check on washrooms, lights and other utilities. Armed with company-supplied protective gloves and a surgical mask, he uses hospitalgrade disinfectant to wipe down door handles and railings. When contract plumbers and electricians visit, sometimes in hazmat suits, they answer questions about their health. More than before, Mr. Butler has time for preventive maintenance.
Industry officials have nothing but praise for the current work of janitors, security officials and property managers, such as Mr. Butler, as the first line of defence in safeguarding vacant buildings.
"When things are going tickety-boo and everything is great, [building staff] are the first line of people who deal with the tenants," says realtor John Whitney, a principal with WCT1, Mr. Butler's employer. "When things don't go well and we are in a pandemic like now, they are equally as valuable to make sure the assets are looked after."

Full text: With evidence building that the nationwide effort to contain the novel coronavirus is working, the conversation has shifted toward reawakening the economy.
This past week, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the federal government is in discussions with the provinces about easing restrictions, although he warned that any significant changes are still weeks away.
The timing and method of orchestrating a recovery that won't jeopardize the health of Canadians has become the economic policy challenge of a generation.
To stave off utter economic devastation, the federal government and the Bank of Canada have already unleashed a barrage of fiscal and monetary firepower. Ottawa has announced more than $260-billion in new spending and other assistance, and the Bank of Canada has injected more than $200-billion into the financial system. Much more stimulus is on the way.
While those measures will soften the blow, they can't restore the economy to its former glory. Canadians who don't have jobs to go back to won't spend like they did before. Even workers who avoided being laid off may be in no rush to book a flight or eat in a restaurant. And for businesses that thrive on crowds, the pandemic is a potential extinction event.
"Once you hit pause on the economy, hitting unpause is not so easy," said Trevin Stratton, chief economist at the Canadian Chamber of Commerce.
Economics textbooks don't say anything about the effects of shutting down much of the global economy, or what might occur after the lockdown is lifted, because nothing like it has ever happened before.
So, economists were operating more on guesswork than anything else when they began to assess the financial damage unleashed by governments as sweeping social and industrial restrictions were enacted around the world to contain the spread of the virus.
As recently as February, many forecasters envisioned a temporary disruption, followed by a swift return to precrisis activity levels. This is the coveted V-shaped recovery - a precipitous decline, proceeded by an equally sharp rise back to full economic health.
Fighting the pandemic, however, has already exacted an immense toll, with the unfolding recession likely to be the worst economic collapse since the Great Depression, and far more severe than the one that came after the 2008-09 global financial crisis.
Undoing the damage already done will be no small feat. And the longer the Great Lockdown drags on, the greater the risk of doing irreversible economic harm.
Because this recession has no historical precedent, the nature of the recovery is also shrouded in uncertainty. Besides V, the letters of the alphabet enlisted to invoke the potential shape of the recession cycle now also include U, W and L.
Whatever the shape of the recovery, one element now seems inescapable - Canada faces a long and difficult economic convalescence in the months and years ahead.
The pandemic hit crisis levels in Europe and North America so quickly, there was no time to consider the lasting effects of economic lockdowns.
Though Canada had its first diagnosed case of COVID-19 in January, until mid-March, it was pretty much business as usual. And then it wasn't.
In a bewildering seven-day stretch, the United States suspended travel from Europe, the National Basketball Association shut down its season, the Italian health-care system was brought to the brink of collapse, global stock markets crashed, Sophie Grégoire Trudeau tested positive for the virus, and the provinces of Ontario and British Columbia declared states of emergency.
The other provinces and territories soon followed suit, closing non-essential businesses, schools and daycares, and ordering much of the Canadian work force to stay home.
In the early days, Bay Street was banking on a brief idling of the economy - just long enough to conquer the virus - after which everything would quickly return to prepandemic form. But now, the prospects for a V-shaped recovery have all but evaporated.
First, a sharp rebound needs a distinct and solid starting point. It also needs catalysts - several of them.
Under normal circumstances, the path out of a recession is dictated by a broad array of economic conditions, including interest rates, employment and consumer confidence. Right now, however, government policy and public health directives remain in control of the business cycle.
In that kind of environment, traditional economic models don't apply. Even the Bank of Canada admits to being in the dark about what lies ahead. It eliminated economic projections from its quarterly monetary policy report, released this past week, saying it can't forecast "with any degree of confidence."
Countries further along the curve of coronavirus infections at least offer some clues. China, for example, saw its outbreak plateau in late February and is experiencing a revival in its manufacturing and service sectors. Both are far from a full recovery, but are at least expanding.
Some European countries are also easing restrictions. Even Spain, which has had the most infections of any country outside the United States, is starting to send factory and construction workers back to work.
The shutting down of productive capacity, however, can't just be immediately reversed. How fast a factory can get back up and running depends in large part on its own supply chain. "You don't just start up an auto plant the next day. Their suppliers are all shut down as well, so there's a lag effect," said Richard Powers, a business professor at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management.
Even before the pandemic upended global commerce, Canadian businesses were reluctant to invest. The trade war between the U.S. and China discouraged Canadian manufacturers from adding capacity. The energy sector didn't have the option to grow, given punishing declines in global oil prices that began in 2014 and no available pipeline capacity to move additional production.
Those concerns now seem minor compared to the social and economic havoc wrought by the worst global health crisis in a century. It's going to take a long time for Canadian businesses to regain the confidence to spend, said Beata Caranci, chief economist at Toronto-Dominion Bank. "There's going to be some residual scarring, and I think it'll be most evident in business investment."
In March alone, Canada's GDP shrunk by a stunning 9 per cent - the leading edge of what the Bank of Canada said will be the sharpest downturn on record. TD expects the Canadian economy to shrink at an annualized rate of 25 per cent in the second quarter.
Even with a big rebound in growth the second half of the year, which depends on easing of business closures and physical distancing rules, Canada will probably only recover half its lost output by the end of this year, Ms. Caranci said. A full rebound looks to be at least two years away.
As the scope of the lockdown now rules out more optimistic forecasts, the Bay Street consensus has shifted to a U-shaped recovery. In that scenario, business and social restrictions drag into the summer, and recouping all of Canada's lost output gets pushed further into the future. Just how far depends in large part on Canadian consumers, and like many businesses, they were already stretched even before the pandemic took hold.
In a typical recession, the manufacturing sector helps lead the way into a recovery. This time, with businesses big and small shuttered, the risks are heavily concentrated in services, which employ the vast majority of Canadian workers in industries such as restaurants, tourism and real estate.
"It's going to be the service sector that will really tell the story of the recovery," Ms. Caranci said.
Within the sector, retail is the largest industry, employing roughly 12 per cent of the entire Canadian labour force.
With Canadians urged to stay home, consumer spending has collapsed. During the week that ended March 30, credit and debit card spending in Canada fell about 60 per cent from the same period last year, according to data from Royal Bank of Canada.
One of the few areas of strength is online retail.
For proof of e-commerce exuberance, look at Amazon.com Inc.'s share price, which soared to all-time highs this week as the company received huge surges in orders.
Prospects are grim, however, for many small bricks-and-mortar retailers. They're worried customers will never come back, and e-commerce giants are getting even bigger at their expense.
In Victoria, the doors are still open at Pets West, a pet-supply store, because the province deemed it an essential service. But after an initial wave of panic buying, owner Lisa Nitkin said sales have slowed considerably. "I think [the pandemic] is going to completely shift consumer habits."
Not only are consumers physically unable to patronize many businesses deemed non-essential, the recently unemployed may be less inclined to do so anyway. March saw more than one million Canadians put out of work. Another 2.1 million worked less than half their usual hours.
"People are losing their jobs," said Ethan Song, the CEO of Montreal-based clothing retailer Frank And Oak. "They're not excited about shopping that much." Mr. Song said he can envision a "slow, progressive return to normal," wherein retail stores are initially open for limited hours, allowing few customers inside, and with staff under tight health protocols.
But those kinds of restrictions may be unrealistic for industries that rely on closeness between their staff and customers, like bars and restaurants.
"I don't know if it's even possible for the whole industry to come back again," said Vikram Vij, the restaurateur and former Dragons' Den judge, who guessed up to 50 per cent of restaurants could fold.
There's no guarantee that diners will return en masse to those that reopen, either. The pandemic will have a lasting effect on the psychology of consumers, the U of T's Mr. Powers said. "People are going to continue to be very wary of their surroundings. They're not going to change their behaviour just because of a government proclamation."
Even before COVID-19, Canadian consumers were already looking tired. Retail sales in 2019 grew by a paltry 1.6 per cent, the slowest annual growth since 2009. The household debt burden is close to a record high, savings rates have recently plumbed multi-year lows and consumer insolvencies are on the rise.
In a public health crisis, economic policy takes its cues from public health officials. "I used to say to staff, ‘Stay two steps behind the chief medical officer of health,' " said Michael Decter, a former deputy minister of health in Ontario. " ‘Whatever he or she says, that's what we're doing.' " Saving as many lives as possible is the only priority early on - at any cost.
Aiding the economy comes afterward. Ottawa's more than $260-billion in assistance includes emergency spending, lending support and tax deferrals. The Bank of Canada is continuing to pump billions into the financial system through quantitative easing - something it didn't do during the financial crisis. The central bank buys government and corporate bonds in the open market, thereby injecting cash into the system.
But governments and central banks can only keep the country on life support for so long. "Once you get past two or three months, it's going to be very difficult for governments to continue to backstop the entire economy," Ms. Caranci said. Federal spending cannot prevent mass layoffs and business failures, and cities are facing deep revenue damage.
Prematurely opening the economy, on the other hand, could trigger a spike in infections and lives lost to COVID-19. This is the grim calculus now facing policymakers in Canada and around the world.
That prospect has led many forecasters to consider a possible W-shaped recovery: a tentative economic rebound, followed by a second wave of the outbreak in the fall or winter. Economists are watching China for signs of this scenario.
China's government has slowly lifted travel restrictions and restarted factories after a disastrous first quarter. So far, nationwide infection rates remain low, but local transmission ticked up this past week, with Beijing seeing its first new cases in three weeks.
As in China, the process of getting Canadians back to work will surely be tentative, starting with low-risk sectors and regions where the outbreak has been most manageable. In Saskatchewan, which is down to one to three new COVID-19 cases per day, a plan to gradually reopen the economy could be released in the coming week, Premier Scott Moe said.
This is how the Canadian economy is going to be reinstated - slowly and incrementally. "You don't have to have a one-day reopening of everything to get a pretty profound bounce," said Mr. Decter, the former health official and now Bay Street fund manager.
Despite talk of a reopening and some encouraging signs, the pandemic has also forced economists to consider potential outcomes that just a few months ago were outside the realm of possibility.
Much of the economic data starting to roll out have no analog other than to the Great Depression, raising the question as to whether something similar is upon us. This is one of the prospects under an L-shaped recovery, whereby the persistence of the outbreak prevents an economic revival before a vaccine can be mass produced, and the downturn lasts for years.
There is no formal definition for a depression, but it is generally considered to be a prolonged slump involving at least a 10-per-cent decline in real GDP. On Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund published global projections suggesting Canada's economy would shrink by 6.2 per cent this year, before rebounding by 4.2 per cent next year.
Even within the depression category, the Great Depression stands alone for its decade of misery, which included double-digit unemployment, bank runs, and waves of credit defaults that central banks did little to try to prevent. "We think a replay of 1929 is unlikely," Martin Roberge, a portfolio strategist at Canaccord Genuity, wrote in a report.
"Contrary to 90 years ago, central banks and governments have acted sooner and bolder with various backstops."
But a depression on a lesser scale is quite possible if the virus cannot be contained enough to resurrect the economy.
"With a depression, the first factor is depth, and the second is duration. And I don't think we're there," Ms. Caranci said. "But if we're still in this state by the end of the summer, it certainly becomes more probable."

Full text: Short-term rental services Airbnb and Vrbo are seeing business evaporate in Canada as travel has all but stopped and several provinces have restricted the use of their services due to the pandemic.
The number of new bookings across the country on Airbnb and Vrbo dropped from 72,000 in February to 23,000 in early April, according to new data from AirDNA, a research firm for real estate investors and property managers.
The country's major Airbnb markets took a big hit, with revenue in Toronto and Vancouver sinking nearly 70 per cent over the past three months, and declining 42 per cent in Montreal, according to AirDNA. New bookings in the three cities were down between 55 per cent and 67 per cent from late February to late March.
"This drop in new bookings shows the extent to which travelers aren't willing to make future plans considering the unpredictable nature of the pandemic, and as well as how the crisis might have a lasting effect on hosts' short-term rental calendars," Scott Shatford, AirDNA's chief executive, said in an e-mail.
Industry watchers say the decline could lead some property owners to put their short-term units on the long-term rental market - which could cause rents in major cities to ease - or put them up for sale.
"We are seeing people who were Airbnb investors deciding to just ditch it and go onto something else," said Carl Langschmidt, owner of brokerage condos.ca, who noticed one Airbnb host list her property this week.
The collapse in travel has slammed the accommodation industry.
More than half the hotels in Canada have temporarily closed, and upward of 200,000 jobs have disappeared.
The travel industry has been calling for government aid.
Airbnb sent Ottawa a letter in March asking for tax relief and employment benefits for its hosts.
Airbnb said on Friday that there has not been any meaningful change to its supply in its major markets.
It said hosts are accepting longer-term stays and many are providing discounts for stays of one month or longer.
An Airbnb spokesperson said on Friday that fewer than 200 active listings have come off the platform in Toronto.
Active Airbnb and Vrbo listings in Canada dropped slightly from 161,000 in February to 148,000 in early April, according to the research company.
With a shortage of housing in major cities and many people unable to afford rent, local governments had already started to restrict short-term rentals. The pandemic triggered further limits in Ontario and Quebec.
Tim Syrianos, a broker with Re/Max Ultimate Realty Inc. in Toronto who used to head the local real estate board, said the city and board have always tried to figure out how many properties were used for Airbnb. "I believe the virus will flush some of the info out," he said.
He is anticipating that Airbnb and Vrbo hosts will convert their properties to long-term rental or be forced to put them on the market, which is starting to occur.
As well, rental prices in the Toronto area are starting come off their peaks. Mr. Syrianos said he has noticed $50 to $150 discounts on one-bedroom condos and one-bedroom plus den condos.
The slight dip in prices for long-term rentals is occurring as thousands of new condo units and apartments are scheduled to be completed in the greater Toronto area this year. That was expected to provide additional housing and potentially ease rental prices in a city with a vacancy rate of 1.5 per cent. Vancouver and Montreal's vacancy rates are below 1.5 per cent, according to the country's national housing agency.
The addition of Airbnb and Vrbo properties could further reduce rents.
"Thousands of housing units have been converted into fulltime short-term rental or removed from the rental market," said David Wachsmuth, a McGill University professor who studies the short-term rental market. "To the extent that they are coming back now, that means there is more housing available for people, and that's going to lower rent and increase the vacancy rate."
Mr. Wachsmuth is tracking new long-term listings on Craigslist and Kijiji and matching them to Airbnb listings. "A bunch are coming up now that are clearly former Airbnb," he said.

Consumers cast doubt on China's economy

Full text: The world's factory may be back in business, but its people are still reeling, as China's first-quarter economic performance - its worst in more than 50 years - serves as a new warning about the depth of the crisis created by the pandemic.
China's GDP contracted 6.8 per cent in the first three months of the year, breaking a decadeslong growth streak. Behind that dire number stands an uneven recovery from the severe lockdowns imposed to slow the spread of the virus, with heavy industry back on its feet while consumers, who have become the real backbone of the world's second-largest economy, continue to stagger.
Take the numbers in March, when parts of China began to emerge from lockdown: Industrial production slipped just 1.1 per cent over the previous year; retail sales, however, fell 15.8 per cent. Chinese policy makers have succeeded in getting big business back to work but have had much less success persuading people to start spending.
"It points to the divide between China's ability to resume production (fast) and its ability to create demand for goods and services (much less obvious)," wrote Alicia Garcia-Herrero, the chief economist for Asia Pacific at Natixis, a French corporate and investment bank, in an emailed response to questions.
China is known to massage its statistics for political reasons; some Western economists estimate the real first-quarter contraction hit 20 per cent. (After weeks of accusations that Chinese authorities have understated the country's death toll from the virus, the number of dead in Wuhan, the epicentre of the outbreak, was revised upward Friday by more than 50 per cent, to 3,869.)
Analysts and economists in China emphasized what they said were positive trends that demonstrated the resiliency of a country battered by a deadly virus but now racing to resume normal life.
If China can constrain COVID-19, "the second half of the year should be better than the first," said Mao Shengyong, a spokesman for the National Bureau of Statistics, on Friday.
"If we compare China with other big global economies, in particular, our economic performance and the speed with which work has resumed in the postepidemic period are very outstanding," said Mei Xinyu, a researcher with the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, a research body under the Ministry of Commerce.
"The data suggests that in March our economy has stood firm," added Yu Miaojie, a scholar at Peking University's National School of Development, pointing to improvement in some indicators relative to January and February.
Other indicators suggest considerably more difficult circumstances. By the end of March, real estate sales and coal consumption for electricity had risen to levels roughly parallel with those of 2019. Both have since declined again. Coal use is now down almost 11 per cent from last year, while real estate sales measured by floor space sold were off 36 per cent this week over the same period in 2019.
The first-quarter performance, meanwhile, is the worst since 1967, according to an analysis by Iris Pang, the chief economist for Greater China with ING Economics.
China has begun using some traditional tools of economic management to revive output.
The issuance of local government special bonds has now exceeded $200-billion, said Ms. Pang, and some of that money is expected to fund big-project spending, a favoured method in China for undergirding growth - although policy makers are now promoting "new infrastructure" that includes data centres and towers for the expansion of 5G mobile networks.
But it's not clear how much these measures can achieve if people are too nervous to open their wallets. Officially, China's urban unemployment eased in March to 5.9 per cent. Some Western economic observers, however, estimate that at least 10 per cent of the country's labour force is out of work.
And while the Communist Party's economic controls can substantially shift the flow of investment and capital spending, the country's leadership has struggled to nudge consumer spending in meaningful ways. In 2014, China's private consumption as a percentage of GDP stood at 37.8 per cent; last year, it was 38.7 per cent. In Canada, private consumption makes up almost 60 per cent of GDP.
"Stoking demand, supporting demand - at this point, that's the absolutely critical policy imperative," said Andrew Polk, founding partner of Trivium, a Beijingbased business advisory firm.
"Businesses will not normalize their output unless they have a customer. And that means both households and other businesses."
But doing so "might be harder for China, because that's not their normal [modus] operandi," he said. Consumer sentiment "very much relies on momentum and psychology" rather than massive outlays of investment such as those that have underpinned past Chinese stimulus programs.
Chinese officials have been directing cash into local stimulus programs that provide vouchers.
Other programs have sought to revive car sales in particular, including bonuses for people who trade in old models.
"People were running scared in the first half of March. They were scared about losing their jobs. They were scared about dying. They were scared about stock and real estate prices collapsing," said Shaun Rein, an expert in consumer behaviour and the founder of China Market Research Group. Chinese passenger car sales were down 48.4 per cent in March. But, Mr. Rein said, there has been "a reasonably strong rebound in the second half of March across many sectors."
Some spending has returned on food, beverages and health care. But there has been less appetite for jewellery or furniture and other household goods. "It would be premature to conclude the worst is past," HSBC economists Julia Wang and Erin Xin wrote in a research note.
Yet there is institutional resistance to helping consumers.
Voucher programs "will only encourage people and companies to maintain bad habits and their heavy reliance on government," said Mr. Mei. Better, he said, to "ease the regulatory burden and restrictions on the development of businesses, thereby injecting more vitality into our economy."
Prof. Yu pointed to small and medium-sized manufacturers, which have "faced the most difficulties and are therefore most in need of help." He said "a massive stimulus program is a must."

Crisis a wake-up call to drive innovation, BMO CEO says

Full text: Bank of Montreal chief executive Darryl White says one unexpected consequence of the global pandemic could be a jolt to Canada's lagging productivity, if key sectors capitalize on the pace of change adopted in response to the coronavirus crisis.
Business leaders and policy makers have focused on the pressing need to safeguard employees, stabilize financial markets and support the companies and workers bearing the brunt of an abrupt slowdown in economic activity.
In an interview, Mr. White urged executives and business owners to also think about how Canada can take advantage of the crisis as a way to become more innovative in the years ahead.
The recovery will be uneven whenever it occurs, he said. Sectors such as travel and entertainment "might take years to get back to normal," while others "could actually outperform over the medium-term." But the wrenching changes that physical distancing and stricter public health measures forced upon most businesses also present opportunities to become more productive under normal circumstances, he said.
On Friday, BMO will release a new report by its chief economist, Douglas Porter, highlighting sectors the bank believes have opportunities to be seized. Among the promising areas are supply chains, remote work, digital commerce, robotics and artificial intelligence, e-learning, local tourism and autonomous vehicles.
"There's a really difficult amount of sledding that will be ahead of us," Mr. White said. "But at the same time, we tried to get the periscope up a little bit above the water line and ask ourselves, what does the world look like out on the horizon? What does it look like in two years?" Canada's "productivity rut" has been a persistent challenge, as growth in labour productivity has trailed the United States and other major economies for most of the past two decades, Mr. White said.
Yet the speed at which the COVID-19 pandemic has swept around the world has forced businesses, including BMO, to cut out "low-value work" - including scores of meetings, slide presentations and multilayered approval processes - and act faster.
Mr. White said BMO's business clients have told him 85 per cent to 90 per cent of the quick decisions they've made in responding to the virus have been the right ones, "with 10 to 15 per cent of the process," he said. Corporate finance work that took six to eight months "in the pre-COVID world" has been done in "six or eight days," even without developing new technology.
If that can be sustained, "you end up leapfrogging in productivity," he said. "The risk, of course, is that in six months from now, we all go back and say, ‘Let's just put all those pieces back together the way they were.' " The potential to shorten some supply chains could give a boost to manufacturing activity in North America, Mr. Porter says in his report, and many firms may boost stockpiles of raw and intermediate materials. But because "firms will still look to minimize costs" and source materials efficiently, he predicts that some of buying behaviour that has been changed by the coronavirus won't be permanent.
It's important for Canada "to get some of the supply chains redomiciled, but I think there's a risk of going overboard," Mr. White said. "It's not to say that we can do everything, or we should do everything here. It's a matter of understanding where the reliability of your allies are in your supply chain."
As companies stockpile more inventory, and as online shopping increases, Mr. Porter predicts there could be increased demand for industrial and warehouse space. That could help offset some of the pain felt by the commercial real estate industry as remote working becomes more common, leading to a drop in demand for office space.
Canada could capitalize on an existing competitive advantage in robotics and technology, where "we've got such a head start from an intellectual capital perspective," Mr. White said. Robotics will change the jobs of some workers, but also fill gaps where there are labour shortages. Firms are keen to harness more real-time data.
And a larger number of deliveries could be made by self-driving vehicles and drones, reducing human contact when moving goods.
And while the travel industry is likely to suffer for some time - even after restrictions on crossborder movement ease - local tourism could surge in popularity, especially while gas prices remain low. This could benefit the motels, restaurants and fuel stations needed to reach nearer destinations.
"It's not just to make us feel good, so that we can feel positive about something for a change," Mr. White said. "It's the accountability of all of us in the leadership ranks to think about, how are we going to make things better when we get out the other side of the tunnel?"

Full text: Real estate lawyer Mark Weisleder has some pragmatic advice for buyers, sellers and real estate agents facing conundrums around closing deals: "You must find a way to make it work."
The partner with RealEstateLawyers.ca LLP says the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic is leading to all manner of glitches between the time when a buyer and a seller sign an agreement of sale and the transaction closes.
"We're in a different world now," Mr. Weisleder says. "You have to understand what you took for granted can't happen."
Some of the issues surrounding real estate deals involve buyer's remorse. Lenders, appraisers and movers all face disruptions to their way of doing business.
Mr. Weisleder has been sorting through such dilemmas with local real estate boards around Ontario. In February, he couldn't get five people to join his online sessions, he jokes.
"Now I'm getting 500 people on my webinars."
Feelings of buyer's remorse surface when people who purchased property during the frothy days of February and early March wonder if they paid too much to beat out legions of competing bidders for a property.
Some of those deals were ink- ed during a time when buyers were paying astounding amounts above the asking price and some bidding wars drew 30, 40 or even 70-plus offers.
By mid-March the market stalled as many sellers pulled their listings, buyers largely retreated and the Government of Ontario began imposing increasingly stringent rules around physical distancing to prevent the spread of COVID-19.
Some of those purchasers may lose their jobs or see their income fall before the closing date.
Others may worry about the risks of moving during a health crisis.
And some may just fear they overpaid.
Mr. Weisleder believes some buyers were unsettled by so much uncertainty.
"People wonder, how is this crisis going to affect prices and values?" Once an outbreak of COVID-19 was declared in Canada, a lot of consumers were under the impression they could back out of a deal, Mr. Weisleder says.
"It doesn't work that way."
He points to April, 2017, when the market fell almost 20 per cent overnight after a foreignbuyers tax and other cooling measures were implemented by the provincial government.
Buyers backed out of agreements and sellers either couldn't find another buyer or had to sell at a price substantially less than the first buyer agreed to pay.
The buyers who walked away were often under the mistaken impression they could just forfeit their deposit. In the courts, many ended up being forced to pay for the seller's losses.
"Sellers sued buyers for substantial amounts of money," Mr. Weisleder says.
April Esteves, a Toronto-based real estate agent with Royal Le- Page Real Estate Services Ltd., has not come across any deals that have come apart because buyers fear they overpaid before the crisis.
In the opening months of 2020 right up until mid-March, there was huge demand from buyers, she says.
Buyers looking for condos in the $600,000 range up to $1-million or so have had a hard time in competition.
"When they finally do get something, it's a relief."
Ms. Esteves sold a three-bedroom, semi-detached house in Toronto's High Park neighbourhood on March 16 for $1.63-million, or $400,000 above the asking price of $1.23-million.
A week earlier, Ms. Esteves says, concerns about COVID-19 were ramping up, so she cancelled the open houses she had planned for the property at 200 Indian Grove in Toronto's west end. Undaunted, potential buyers booked private appointments instead.
"We had a huge amount of showings."
On offer night, multiple offers arrived electronically.
"For the most part, people are really happy to get into these neighbourhoods," she says.
"They may have waited a long time.
The morning following that sale, the agents in her office packed up their belongings and began working from home.
Ms. Esteves says buyers have mostly moved to the sidelines and agents are reluctant to take on new listings unless a homeowner urgently needs to sell.
She adds that many agents are also discouraging buyers who are hoping to be opportunistic from looking for a deal now because most people don't want to visit a property in person.
"I don't think a lot of agents would take that upon themselves."
Ms. Esteves says some sales are still happening because an estate needs to be settled or a couple is divorcing. Some people have already given notice on a rental or they are moving into the city for the first time.
She has also heard of a trickledown effect when it comes to closing time. If one party hits a snag, everyone has to work together to work it out.
For example, if a landlord sells an income property and the tenant doesn't leave by the closing date, the parties have to work out an arrangement.
"We're really not in position to force that tenant to leave."
She says relationships between tenants and landlords, buyers and sellers, and competing agents have all become more co-operative than ever before.
"It really is down to a lot of open communication," she says.
"It's not adversarial."
Mr. Weisleder also believes that parties need to be transparent and flexible.
He says some buyers do try to negotiate a reduction in price - which the seller may agree to rather than have the deal collapse.
Mr. Weisleder says he typically urges both sides to reach an agreement, whether that involves an extension of the time until closing or an adjustment to the price.
Mr. Weisleder points out to sellers that suing a runaway buyer may not bring a satisfactory result in any case. A first-time buyer, for example, may not have enough assets to make a court battle worthwhile.
"What's the point of suing someone who doesn't have any money? We do our best to get the deal done."
In some cases, a buyer may want to go ahead with a purchase but may not be able to obtain a mortgage for the agreed-upon price. In that case, a vendor may consider extending a loan - which the buyer can pay back over a couple of years - for the difference between the mortgage provided by the lender and the sale price.
Mr. Weisleder cautions, however, that some lenders do not allow second mortgages, so buyers must beware of the small print.
Another hitch can arise if a deal is conditional on a home inspection and the inspection can't be done because of safety measures. Some home inspection companies have temporarily suspended operations altogether.
In cases where an inspection can't be completed, Mr. Weisleder has suggested sellers offer warranties against flaws in major elements such as the heating and air conditioning system or the roof.
And if an appraiser is reluctant to enter a property, perhaps he or she can wear gloves and a mask and keep the visit very short, the lawyer says. The appraiser may be able to walk around the exterior and come up with an appraisal that satisfies the lender, he says.
"Lenders are being creative too," he says. "I haven't heard of deals cancelling because of this."
In their own practice, Mr. Weisleder and his partners are doing all of their business with electronic document signing and online payments. Upon closing, keys can be sheltered in a lockbox, he says, and the code is supplied to the buyer once they have transferred the money to the lawyers.
As for registering title, Mr. Weisleder says the province's land registration system is still operating.
Many agents who raise questions during the webinars worry about the possibility of the system closing down, or what happens if there's a snafu between closing and the time title is registered.
Mr. Weisleder points out many buyers also acquire title insurance to protect against loss or damages from things such as liens and encumbrances. Socalled gap coverage, he explains, is designed to bridge that time between closing and registration.
One setback his practice has come across is that the banks still require that funds provided to pay off the seller's existing mortgage be handed over in the form of a certified cheque.
Mr. Weisleder would like to see that changed to an electronic funds transfer.
"The bank is so set in their ways," he says. "If it takes a crisis to change this, it should."

Full text: Back in October, long-time residents of North Vancouver, B.C., might have been confused by a real estate flyer hailing their neighbourhood as "The Next Palm Springs." Although it's a bit of a stretch to compare the luxurious desert retreat of Hollywood stars to a middle-class neighbourhood perched below the ski slopes of Grouse Mountain, the two communities do have one thing in common: outstanding examples of mid-century modern architecture.
Palm Springs is code for a kind of West Coast cool - referencing post-and-beam construction, an open interior plan, grand floor-toceiling windows that "let the outside in" and wraparound decks and shallow rooflines with generous overhangs.
The house at 4089 Skyline Dr.
was being marketed by West Coast Modern, a team of real estate agents with backgrounds in advertising and branding. The "Vista House" invite-only event featured B.C. wines, artisanal cheeses and a jazz guitarist, and saw more than 250 people pass through on a rainy midweek school night. The foyer was filled with Blundstone boots and Arc'teryx jackets as young families from Yaletown and East Van toured the charming, yet modestly sized house.
"Vista House was a Bob Lewis restoration that had been on the market for over a year with little interest," West Coast Modern partner Trent Rodney said. "We created a [marketing] campaign that compared Lewis's homes with those built by Joseph Eichler, a California builder whose homes command a premium in that redhot housing market. The house had yet to be listed on MLS, but we had an offer by 8:06."
Back in the 1950s, young Vancouver architects embraced modern home designs popular in California and adapted them to the rugged rain forest of coastal British Columbia. Architects such as Arthur Erickson, Ned Pratt, Fred Hollingsworth and Ron Thom embraced the rocky, lichen-covered outcrops and forest canopy by siting homes that took advantage of sweeping views and natural light. They borrowed the simple functionality of post-andbeam construction used by Austrian-American architects Rudolph Schindler and Richard Neutra, who visited Vancouver on numerous occasions and whose ideas strongly influenced artists Bert and Jessie Binning, whose Binning House is listed on Canada's historic register.
Vancouver architects and builders made their own interpretations of the "rules" of modernism; Erickson's geometric "half Aframe" Mitchell Residence, (renovated in the past decade), is something of a head-scratcher. In the same North Vancouver neighbourhood, Fred Hollingsworth - a British draftsman who once turned down a job offer from Frank Lloyd-Wright - designed kithomes for postwar families; simple, flat-roofed houses he called "Neoteric" homes. Among the architectural cognoscenti, the Capilano Highlands subdivision became known as "Hollingsworth's Oak Park." Mr. Rodney recently sold a Hollingsworth Neoteric near Edgemont Village earlier this year that was a masterpiece in brick - both inside and out.
There are dozens of West Coast mid-century modern homes still standing in the Edgemont Village, Forest Hills and Montroyal areas of North Vancouver. But as their original owners downsize or pass on, many are knocked down and replaced by opulent spec homes; 6,000- to 8,000-square-foot mansions maximized for resale value.
But even those whose owners decide to renovate can be endangered. Despite best intentions, renovations can bring surprises along the way; structural defects can see costs rapidly escalate and such projects are rarely straight forward. Consequently, well-renovated mid-century modern homes are in high demand.
In February, realtor Derek Grech ran a contest to "win a trip for two to Palm Springs and $500 spending money" to drum up interest in a mid-century modern property at 4448 Skyline Dr. Set back on a large massive forested lot that slopes down to a gushing mountain creek, the dramatic post-and-beam home was designed by architect D.W. Lichtensteiger to house his family of four back in 1957. The side-split home was crafted from carefully selected old-growth timber beams that run the entire length of the house.
Futuristic design touches included hot water radiant heated floors, custard-coloured Scandinavian couches and built-in Hi-Fi and TV cabinets.
The house had gone through an ownership change or two when a family with deep roots in North Vancouver purchased the house for $600,000 in 2002. Six years later, 90 per cent of the rest of the house was rehabilitated for a price well above replacement cost. The exposed beams, which had been painted over, were reclad in Douglas fir. Kitchen cupboards were refashioned in ash.
For earthquake safety, steel rods were integrated into frame. Van Dusen Gardens landscaped the property with native plants. "It's like living in Stanley Park," Mr. Gretch says. The current list price is $3.498-million.
The future is less bright for some other nearby MCM homes.
Near the top of Skyline Drive, a dense forest of second-growth fir and cedar hides what was once an outstanding post-and-beam home. The house itself was doubtless a beauty back in its day, but has now been vacant for several years. It sold last fall for $900,000, essentially, lot value. Clearly, the intention is to demolish, but even that will be an expensive proposition. Closer to Edgemont Village, a Hollingsworth Neoteric which backs onto a municipal park is being marketed as a place to "build your dream home." No fancy Palm Springs comparisons, here; the asking price is $2.1-million.
Still, Mr. Rodney remains optimistic that many of the remaining mid-century moderns can be saved from the wrecking ball.
"The market for these homes is international. I've had people come from Los Angeles and Chicago to look at homes on the North Shore." But there's a great deal of local interest as well, even if the cost is well above what many people can afford. "A lot of people who are interested in these homes - especially young professionals here in Vancouver -are stretched to the limit if a house is more than $2.5-million. We have dozens of young families who would love to breathe new life into these homes."

Full text: Home sales across Canada slumped in the second half of March and deteriorated further in early April, as the coronavirus pandemic shut down activity and thousands of jobs disappeared.
Last month, 38,911 homes were sold on a seasonally adjusted basis.
That was down 14 per cent from 45,410 in February, according to the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA), with activity declining sharply in Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver and the country's other large markets.
The real estate association said preliminary data from the first week in April suggest both sales and new property listings were only about half of what would be normal for that time of the year.
"As we get further into this quarantine, we are seeing it wind down increasingly," said Shaun Cathcart, the group's senior economist.
Sales started plummeting in the second half of March when the federal and local governments restricted activity and warned Canadians to stay at home. In the weeks leading to mid-March, real estate markets in Southern Ontario, Montreal and Vancouver were overheating with buyers competing for properties and driving up prices.
"Home sales and listings were increasing heading into what was expected to be a busy spring," CREA president Jason Stephen said in a statement accompanying the results.
"After Friday the 13th, everything went sideways."
In Alberta, where the economy has struggled since the 2015 oil crash, sales plummeted by 27 per cent in Calgary. In Edmonton, sales dropped by 15 per cent.
In Ontario, it wasn't just major cities that suffered.
Smaller regions that had seen a surge in investor demand also took a hit. Sales in Niagara, which borders the United States, dropped 26 per cent; the Hamilton-Burlington area in Southern Ontario fell by one-quarter. Kitchener-Waterloo, London and St. Thomas also saw double-digit declines.
However, the average selling price of a home across the country rose slightly to $530,433 in March from $527,416 in the previous month. The real estate association said the price growth reflects what was occurring in the first half of March, not the current situation. Calgary and Toronto each recorded a tiny price decline monthto-month, while Saguenay and Sherbrooke in Quebec saw prices ease in the low single digits.
"The numbers that matter most for understanding what follows are those from mid-March on, and things didn't really start to ratchet down until week four," Mr. Cathcart said.
Although the Bank of Canada cut the benchmark interest rate from 1.75 per cent to 0.25 per cent in March, fixedmortgage rates are not down as dramatically.
This week, lenders started reducing those rates after raising borrowing costs at the end of March. The most popular type of mortgage in Canada, the five-year fixed-rate mortgage, is similar to what it was prior to the pandemic.
The cheaper loans are not encouraging potential home buyers to get into the market. At the same time, fewer homeowners are putting their properties up for sale.
The number of newly listed homes declined by 13 per cent in March compared with February. The shortage of listings coupled with the lack of demand could keep prices from spiralling down.
"As much as sales are slowing, so are listings," Mr. Cathcart said. "The market balance has not changed. It is still tight. It seems like everyone is putting activity on pause."

Canmore housing corporation cuts rents amid pandemic

Full text: The town-owned housing corporation in Canmore, Alta., has cut rent prices by 25 per cent to offset the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in a region where the tourism-dependent economy has been hit particularly hard.
The economic impact of the shutdowns and physical-distancing measures are making things worse for a community that already has acute housing problems, with a shortage of units driving up rents and home prices.
Landlords across Alberta are facing pressure to either defer rental payments or offer a break to tenants who are facing sudden unemployment. The provincial government has prohibited rent increases and evictions for missed rental payments during the pandemic.
In Canmore, the town owns and operates Canmore Community Housing Corp., which was launched 20 years ago to increase the supply of affordable permanent and rental housing to the local work force and long-term residents.
The housing corporation's "perpetually affordable housing," as it's called, provides homes and rentals for residents at a cost less than Canmore's market prices.
Mayor John Borrowman said that just prior to the widespread response to COVID-19, Canmore's real estate prices were some of the highest in the country. He said the increasing prices of rental and permanent housing have even driven out some of the town's residents who couldn't keep up.
"We don't know where the COVID situation is going to leave us in regards to the issues we're talking about: housing, employment and all of that," said Mr. Borrowman, who also sits on the housing corporation's board.
"But for the town, we're doing what we can in terms of the housing corporation, we're doing what we can to provide relief to residents in the community."
There are 165 units in town that benefit from below-market rates through the housing corporation; 125 of them were allowed to apply for the 25-per-cent rent reduction.
A housing-needs assessment conducted by the town's housing corporation and Bow Valley Regional Housing reviewed the housing situation in 2016. It found 663 renting households, about 29 per cent, spent too much of their income on housing, labelling them in affordability need.
About 200 people of them spent more than half their wages on housing, the assessment said.
Mr. Borrowman says he believes the rent reduction helped the vast majority of tenants make their payments, but won't know how effective it is until CCHC receives the numbers later this month.
Unlike CCHC, the Bow Valley Regional Housing facility in Canmore is run by the province and doesn't have the option of cutting rent prices to the 58 low-income social housing units in the town.
Bow Valley's portfolio is primarily seniors with pensions and income supplements, said Grant Canning, chair of the facility's board. He doesn't expect that those tenants will find it difficult to make the month's rent.
"Where I do think we're going to run into a bit of a challenge, and we know this is coming, is in our social housing portfolio," Mr. Canning said.
"People who, you know, are really struggling to pay rent already and now a lot of them have probably been laid off and they're going through the process of applying for the emergency relief benefit and things like that."
Mr. Canning said the housing facility had been notified that at least 30 per cent of residents were going to have difficulty paying their rent. They haven't received word from the province on how to handle the challenges that tenants are facing, Mr. Canning said, but are working on a case-by-case basis for the time being.
While Bow Valley's facility awaits orders from the province, Canmore's housing corporation will determine if it needs to extend the opportunity for rental relief to next month as well.

Full text: If you've seen an influx of sourdough starters on your Instagram stories, you're not alone.
Over the past three weeks, Google Trends searches for "bread" have hit all-time highs, #breadmaking has garnered nearly half a million posts on social media and grocery stores are facing flour shortages.
"We've seen close to a 700-percent increase in flour sales from our shop. The demand picked up shortly after panicked shoppers started emptying grocery shelves," says Matthew Faust, general manager of Brodflour, an urban mill and bakery in Toronto.
The bread hype prompted Burdock, a craft brewery in Toronto, to include "MOM," what it calls its sourdough starter, for free with local beer deliveries. High demand has caused them to consider charging a nominal fee and donating the cash to charity. "We noticed a huge uptick in people baking sourdough at home and when we put a call out to see who was interested in MOM, the response was incredible," says Matt Park, co-owner and brewery director at Burdock. "We've given away over 300 sourdough starters in the last two weeks."
On the surface, it's easy to attribute the rise of timelapsed loaves to boredom - it's a wholesome activity to pass the time while social distancing - but it turns out there's a scientific reason why everyone's hopping on the breadbaking bandwagon.
In times of crisis, people covet creature comforts, and few things are as simple, yet satisfying, as freshly baked bread. Dating back to the Stone Age, bread making is one of the earliest chemistry experiments in human history. The first loaf was an accidental discovery after one of our Neolithic ancestors ground wild seeds and grains, added water and left the lumpy "dough" on hot stones in the embers of a fire.
To this day, the ingredients of flour, water, yeast and salt are cheap and cheerful - and psychologically reassuring to our sapient selves that we can take survival into our own hands.
Our brains have limited bandwidth, and lately the majority of our mental real estate has been overtaken by anxiety and fear, but the holy grail of grain gives our monkey minds an easily digestible diversion.
"Eating carbohydrate foods like bread stimulates insulin, which raises the uptake by the brain of the essential amino acid, tryptophan," says Harvey Anderson, professor of nutritional sciences at the University of Toronto. "Tryptophan in the brain increases production of serotonin, a neurotransmitter that promotes calm and sleep in times of stress. So enjoy your fresh bread, just don't eat the whole loaf at one time."
Remember Maslow's hierarchy of needs from first-year psychology? The five-level pyramid is another reason we're indulging in carb therapy. Providing warm food for ourselves and others incites a primal sense of security, while learning a new skill elicits positive feelings of accomplishment related to personal growth.
During periods of high stress and hardship, the motivation to fulfill these needs becomes stronger.
"For me, bread making is therapy," says Joel Harrower, a musician and home chef based in Huntsville, Ont., who showcases his creations on Instagram. "Often, the tempo of life doesn't allow for 18 hours of any one thing.
Baking slow-fermented bread forces me into its cadence and giving up that control over my schedule is very relaxing."
The process engages all five senses. Kneading dough is rhythmic and repetitive, a cathartic activity that makes people feel purposeful and productive. The tactile task is like a kitchen meditation; while our body is busy, our minds have room to relax, regroup and refocus.
Watching dough rise and shapeshift triggers pleasure centres in the brain, while the smell of freshly baked bread instigates a Pavlovian response through "odour-cued memories," according to food scientists at University College Dublin's Institute of Food and Health, sparking familiar, cozy feelings from childhood.
Listening for "the hollow sound" is another crucial component of the craft. If you tap on the loaf and hear a dull thud, it's not quite ready, but if you strike it like a drum and there's a slight reverb, a "hollowness," it's good to go.
Bakers often describe loaves as "singing," "crackling," "popping" and "whistling" as the crust contracts and cools.
When faced with emotional and financial scarcity, our brain naturally reverts to ways it can boost our spirits and stretch our dollars. Baking bread satiates those cravings. We also prioritize instant gratification when the future feels foggy. In chaos, people cling to what they can control and following a recipe is a process that yields predictable results.
"That feeling of pulling a freshly baked loaf out of the oven carries over into the next day, making the baker more likely to keep on with the act of creative cooking," writes Dr. Tamlin Conner, psychologist and professor at the University of Otago in New Zealand and lead author of the study Everyday Creative Activity as a Path to Flourishing published in the Journal of Positive Psychology.
Creating something from nothing and witnessing the fruits (or grains) of our labour is rewarding during these trying times while reminding us of the science of life. So, bake on. It won't be this crumby forever.

Full text: Hemmed in by the ocean, mountains and protected lands, space-starved industrial properties in greater Vancouver are hungry to operate closer to e-commerce driven urban markets.
In response, some B.C. developers are finding ways to build up, not out, to intensify employmentgenerating warehouse, distribution and light manufacturing businesses.
Two projects under construction in Vancouver - one downtown and one in the suburbs - are current Canadian examples of a global phenomenon known as "stacked industrial." In effect, developers build multiple storeys (two or higher) for industrial users, one above the other, instead of housing each in traditional one-storey warehouses.
Such vertical-prone projects, developers and real estate analysts say, suit markets with a limited supply of employment lands, low vacancy rates (currently 1.4 per cent in Vancouver) and high demand for warehouse, distribution and manufacturing space.
"Looking through the lens of the needs of Vancouver, this [stacked industrial option] is a necessity for places like us because we are geographically constrained and we have very limited land supply left," says Chris MacCauley, a Vancouver-based senior vice-president who specializes in industrial properties for CBRE Ltd. "This is how we are going to cope with it," he says.
Like others, he also cautions: "It is not the answer for all our industrial needs."
One of Vancouver's stacked industrial projects is on the eastern edge of False Creek Flats, close to downtown, transit and bike trails.
Before its purchase by Vancouver developer PC Urban Properties Corp., the site housed a building of about 35,000 square feet with half a dozen employees, says Matt Smith, vice-president of industrial at Colliers International and listing agent for PC Urban's project.
Construction began recently on PC Urban's replacement building that offers 105,000 square feet on four storeys for purchase, not lease, by a variety of industrial users and possibly up to 400 employees. The building, with high ceilings ranging between 16 and 20 feet high and large central freight elevators, includes two levels of underground parking. It is set to open in September, 2021, with 40 per cent of the space already sold prior to construction.
The site intensification, permitted under local zoning rules, supports Vancouver's goal to generate employment, Mr. Smith says.
By design, PC Urban chief executive officer Brent Sawchyn says, the False Creek project known as IntraUrban Evolution "is more for local and regional businesses that have difficulty finding functional space unless they go way out [into the suburbs]."
He adds, "there are consequences for these businesses to be way off in the suburbs, often away from where their employees are."
With growth in e-commerce and traffic congestion, some manufacturers and distributors need to be close to their urban markets.
"We have no land, generally, in Metro Vancouver," Mr. Sawchyn says.
"How are we going to accommodate all these businesses? The only way to do that is by going vertical."
Another version of the stacked industrial concept is under construction in suburban Burnaby, where Oxford Properties Group is building a two-storey, 707,000square-foot industrial facility at the company's 65-acre Riverbend Business Park.
Located on a site that once served a former paperboard milling plant and a 14-acre landfill, the master-planned park will house a total of six warehouse and distribution facilities (four are already built) and offer a variety of employee-friendly amenities.
The multilevel building, set to open in mid-2022 with LEED-certified environmental ratings, has ground-floor space of 437,000 square feet and a higher-thanaverage ceiling height of 32 feet for extra clearance and 270,000 square feet on the 28-foot-high second floor that includes its own-level parking for tenants.
The building will have a heated exterior ramp for 53-foot trailers to make deliveries and a 130-foot court for trucks to circulate.
"A lot of thought went into the design to make sure this building functions as any other standard distribution building," says Jeff Miller, Oxford's head of industrial properties. "We didn't want to sacrifice any physical attributes for having this building stacked."
While the two Vancouver projects are among the first in Canada, stacked buildings are well established in other global centres, in Asia and parts of the United States, where industrial space is at a premium and demand runs high from tenants with a growing e-commerce business.
In 2018, San Francisco-based Prologis Inc. built a first-of-itskind three-floor industrial warehouse close to downtown Seattle, including second-storey access for tractor-trailers. The 590,000square-foot facility includes Amazon and Home Depot as its firstand second-storey tenants, respectively.
"As retailers look to cut delivery times from days to hours, particularly due to the rise of e-commerce, it is critical for them to locate their distribution facilities closer to consumers," Prologis director of communications Paul Frankle stated in an e-mail. "Going vertical is one of the innovations Prologis has developed as a way to provide our customers with modern space near consumers in dense, urban areas. While multi-storey logistics facilities are fairly new to the U.S., we have been developing multi-storey logistics facilities for years in other markets around the world, most notably in Japan."
Still, stacked industrial buildings come with challenges. A 2019 report by Colliers International cites industry estimates that these vertical buildings cost up to three times as much to build as a conventional warehouse. Oxford's Mr. Miller says, "the market fundamentals need to be really strong to justify this type of construction."
The upside of going higher, of course, is the potential for more rentable space from the same-size lot as a conventional building.
Mr. Smith, of Colliers, says he knows of several groups in Vancouver now weighing plans to build stacked industrial projects over the next three to five years.
"When I have been asked to provide purchasers with a list of options to stay in Vancouver, they might have only one option," he says. "Now these stacked industrial projects are providing them with a few more options where they can expand and stay [close to their markets]."

Full text: 26 Stuart St.
GUELPH, ONT.
Asking price: $1,775,000 Taxes: $7,577.00 (2019) Lot size: Under 1/2 acre Agent: Aimee Puthon (Coldwell Banker Neumann Real Estate) THE BACKSTORY One landmark property that draws the attention of passers-by in Guelph, Ont., is an English Tudor revival home in the historic enclave of St. George's Park.
The house on a corner lot at 26 Stuart St. is the former coach house of a stately home nearby.
The mansion, known as Ker Cavan, was built between 1854 and 1856 for Rev. Arthur Palmer, who was the rector of St. George's Anglican Church across the river.
The 23-acre estate sat on a bluff high above the Speed River.
Decades later, in 1925, the manse was purchased by the insurance executive Henry Higinbotham.
During an extensive overhaul of his newly acquired estate, Higinbotham tore down an old barn and stable and replaced them with a building to house his limousines. The gardener and chauffeur also lived in the new coach house, which was built in 1928.
Higinbotham's gardener, George Davies, raised five children there with his wife, Edith. The chauffeur, Alvin Ward, lived with his family above the garage.
The coach house also contained the heating system, which funnelled warmth to the main house through an underground tunnel. That way, if there was a fire or explosion in the furnace room, the main house could be protected from the inferno.
A glass greenhouse on a stone foundation was attached to the coach house so that Davies could tend flowers and vegetables for the estate.
Over time, the Ker Cavan property was carved up to create a leafy residential area that connects to downtown Guelph through a historic footbridge over the Speed River.
"This neighbourhood sits on the river's edge where the Speed meets the Eramosa," says real estate agent Aimee Puthon of Coldwell Banker Neumann Real Estate. "The setting is really quite something in all four seasons."
As the land was sub-divided, a more recent house was built between Ker Cavan and its coach house.
In 1988, the city of Guelph designated the coach house as a heritage property protected under conservation rules. The designation covers the white stucco exterior with black strapping, some of the towering trees that line the grounds and a picturesque wishing well.
"It's kind of famous in the Guelph community," says Ms. Puthon of 26 Stuart, which was featured on the Doors Open architectural tour in 2017.
Two of the visitors who joined a tour of the property were the daughters of the former gardener, Davies.
THE HOUSE TODAY Owners Lynne and Rob Wolstenholme purchased the three-bedroom house in 2014.
"It's a lovely old home," Ms. Wolstenholme says. "There is so much history."
She enjoyed collecting old stories and vintage photographs, which she plans to leave for future owners.
Soon after purchasing the property, the Wolstenholmes undertook their own renovation to update the interior while preserving the exterior and grounds.
The home needed new insulation to replace the old horse hair in the walls and newspaper around the chimneys. There's a new furnace and modern kitchen and bathrooms.
Today, the house has more than 4,000 square feet of living space, including a deep basement.
Guests arrive to a foyer that leads to a great room with living and dining areas.
A wall of French doors overlooks the garden.
Ms. Wolstenholme says she learned from local residents that the great room has a concrete floor below the hardwood because that was the area that housed the cars in the 1920s.
"I still learn because it's a famous little house in Guelph."
The original kitchen was cramped and hemmed in by a large brick fireplace.
"This was servants' quarters," she points out.
The Wolstenholmes took over a sitting area and removed the fireplace in order to create an expansive new kitchen with a large island and breakfast bar.
The kitchen has built-in appliances, a coffee bar and a window seat.
Upstairs, the house has a master bedroom with an ensuite bathroom. The couple updated the bathroom with a walk-in shower and his-and-hers vanities, but they kept the fixtures - such as a deep claw foot tub - in keeping with the heritage of the home.
In the main bathroom, the couple preserved a cast iron tub that Ms. Wolstenholme believes is original to the house.
There are two additional bedrooms and an open landing overlooking the living area.
Downstairs the home has a basement with a 10-foot-high ceiling. The deep basement - unusual in a coach house - was created to keep the heating system.
Today, the basement provides a large recreation room and the tunnel has long been filled in.
The former entrance is hidden behind a bar and entertaining area.
Ms. Wolstenholme has visited Ker Cavan and seen the other end of the tunnel, which appeared rather grim.
"It's certainly not romantic. It's utilitarian for sure," she says.
On the main floor of the coach house, the former potting shed has been turned into a mud room close to the garage.
Outside, there's a stone terrace and extensive gardens.
Ms. Puthon says the home remains on the market during the COVID-19 crisis, but there are no open houses and strict precautions are being taken around showings.
She has created a website with virtual tours and photo galleries online.
The market in Guelph is still moving, she says, but the real estate business is adapting on a daily basis to the state of emergency.
"We're watching it in slow motion from country to country and it feels fast and slow at the same time," she says of the pandemic.
THE BEST FEATURE The gardens are the creation of John Reinhart, who has been tending the property since the 1990s, Ms. Wolstenholme says.
Mr. Reinhart, grounds manager at the University of Guelph, designed the main garden in 1993.
When the Wolstenholmes took over, they replaced one of the home's two driveways with a new garden area.
Mr. Reinhart planned the walkways, trellises and plantings for the expanded gardens, she says.
Today the property is sheltered by trees that were planted more than a century ago. There's a long-established lilac bush, forsythia growing over the trellises and beds full of perennials and tall grasses.
In the spring, an abundance of tulips come into bloom.
"People just stop and stare at the gardens," Ms. Wolstenholme says.
Children love the antique wishing well, which stands in an area her grandchildren call the "secret garden," she says.
"It makes a good little scary place for Halloween."

Full text: Home sales in Toronto and Vancouver soared in the first half of March and then plummeted in the second as the spread of COVID-19 prompted provincial governments to shut down activity, according to the local real estate boards.
"There was a clear break in market activity," said the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board.
In the first half of March, 4,643 homes sold in the Toronto region, a 49-per-cent increase over the same period last year. In the second half of the month, 3,369 homes sold, a 16-per-cent decline over the same two weeks last year.
Similarly in Vancouver, there were an average of 138 daily residential sales in the Vancouver region in the earlier half of the month. In the latter half, the daily average fell to 93 sales, the Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver said.
"The first two weeks of the month were the busiest days of the year for our region, with heightened demand and multiple offers becoming more common," Ashley Smith, the board's president, said in a statement accompanying the results.
"This changed as concerns over the COVID-19 situation in our province grew."
Over all, 2,525 homes sold in the Vancouver region in March - a 46-per-cent increase over last year, when buyers were still coming to terms with tougher mortgage rules.
That's the ninth consecutive month of double-digit year-overyear increases.
But Ms. Smith said many of the sales were in process before the provincial government declared a state of emergency and curtailed non-essential activity.
In the Toronto region, 8,012 homes were sold last month, an increase of 12 per cent over March, 2019.
Although the majority of sales occurred before the province started shutting down non-essential services and Canadians were told to stay at home, there were still reports of properties receiving multiple offers in the last few days of the month.
The average selling price for a home was $902,680 in March, 15 per cent higher than last year. But the average selling price in the second half of the month was lower than the first half.
Since last year, the Toronto and Vancouver housing markets have been rebounding from the slowdown brought on by a tax on foreign buyers and stringent loanqualification rules.
By January, February and early March, the market had become highly competitive owing to the shortage of homes for sale.
That competition was starting to push home prices higher.
In the Vancouver region, the benchmark price or the industry calculation for all types of homes was $1,033,700 last month. That is a 2-per-cent increase over March, 2019.
Whistler and Squamish recorded the steepest increases, with both areas up a minimum of 4 per cent year over year.
With fewer sales and warnings against holding open houses, realtors predicted that home prices would remain flat.
"I don't see how we can see an increase in prices with the decline in number of sales happening," said Richard Laurendeau, manager of Re/Max Westcoast.
Although the Bank of Canada cut interest rates three times in March - they're now at 0.25 per cent - the mortgage rates on new loans aren't that much lower than they were earlier this year. Government shutdowns have closed most industries and led to scores of job losses.
Realtors have been deemed an essential service in British Columbia and Ontario, but many buyers and sellers have put their plans on hold.
"We'll need more time to pass to fully understand the impact the pandemic is having on the housing market," Ms. Smith said.

Landlords push back against rent-relief requests from big firms

Full text: Commercial property landlords are balking at requests for rent relief from big companies, saying they need to focus on helping vulnerable smaller tenants such as independent restaurants, clothing stores and barbershops that may not survive the huge losses from the coronavirus pandemic.
With non-essential retail outlets shut down across the country, and small businesses of all kinds seeing revenue vanish, many are saying they will simply not pay rent on April 1, and are asking for more prolonged waivers or deferrals.
The trouble for many commercial property owners is that several big companies are also asking for breaks, including Canadian Tire Corp. Ltd.
and A&W Canada. Two sources told The Globe and Mail that Canadian Tire has asked for a six-month abatement on rent and operating costs starting May 1 for its non-Canadian Tire brands, which include the sports retailer Sport Chek and the clothing chain Mark's.
The sources were granted confidentiality because they were not authorized to speak publicly.
Canadian Tire said in an e-mailed statement to The Globe that it was "navigating through these unprecedented times. We are working with all of our strategic partners through this difficult time and we are confident we will reach a mutual agreement."
But many commercial landlords object strongly to those sort of requests from large tenants.
"When a company that is well capitalized that has a legal obligation to pay rent, doesn't pay rent, I think it is bad behaviour," said Michael Cooper, chief executive with Dream Office REIT, which owns 32 office properties, mostly in Toronto.
"They hurt landlords' ability to be able to help people that need it the most. If companies have the money, they have the legal obligation," Mr. Cooper said.
"If they don't pay the rent, they are taking advantage of people in a very dire situation and that really is unseemly."
Canadian Tire and other big names are able to flex their muscle because they are considered top tenants that can withstand economic downturns. Their tenancy often makes it easier for property owners to get lower mortgage rates and they can make a shopping centre more desirable because they draw more traffic to the property.
In return, landlords often ask for less rent and give into their demands, which they do not do with smaller businesses.
"That is the reality of playing in the playground with the biggest kid. The biggest kid is the most powerful," said Steven Pearlstein, a lawyer with Minden Gross LLP, who specializes in commercial real estate. "That is human nature, the guy who has the most power dictates the terms."
But the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic has created immediate and widespread problems for landlords. If a tenant does not pay the rent, then the landlord will have a harder time paying his or her bills, including taxes, insurance and loan payments.
Those shortfalls, in turn, will hit lenders and government coffers. In some cases, insufficient funds will eat away at the returns of pension funds that own commercial properties.
Commercial property brokers and lawyers have been warning clients on both sides - tenants and landlords - not to take a hard line with one another by refusing to pay rent or threatening immediate eviction.
If a tenant refuses to pay the rent and is evicted right away, both sides could suffer once the economy recovers. The landlord will have empty space and the tenant will have a bad reputation and no means of making up lost revenue.
Ontario, British Columbia, Quebec, Nova Scotia and Alberta have temporarily halted evictions for some or all residential tenants hurt by the pandemic. However, similar moratoriums are not in place for commercial tenants except in New Brunswick.
Technically, if a tenant does not pay rent, the tenant has defaulted on its lease and the landlord has the right to lock the tenant out. But some tenants doubt courts will look favourably on an eviction during a global crisis.
That could be a risky assumption for those tenants, however. "If you are an opportunist, you will have a black name next to your tenancy," said Stan Krawitz, vicechairman with commercial real estate company Savills Canada.
Dream Office and other larger landlords such as mall owners, Oxford Properties and Ivanhoé Cambridge, have said they would defer rent for some of their struggling tenants. But other landlords are still telling their tenants they must pay the rent.
Many small retailers and restaurants say they simply don't have enough money to pay the rent, and some are withholding their monthly payments or sending cheques they know will bounce.
"Quite frankly, we won't be able to pay. I guess it will go to the bank and be withdrawn and then it will bounce," said Takaaki Masuda, whose family has four restaurants in B.C., including a successful highend sushi restaurant in Vancouver called Kamei Royale. The family's monthly rent of more than $150,000 was due on Wednesday.
The family has been trying to negotiate with four landlords and is getting wildly different answers from them, Mr. Masuda said. One property management company, acting on behalf of a group of investors from China and another owner, sent the family a letter simply saying it's "business as usual" and that the rent is due.
But a local commercial landlord has offered to defer rent for a month and said he will reassess after that. Another has talked about wanting to get just the base rent for now.
In Toronto, Chris Hammell, who operates two barbershops, has been keeping in touch regularly with one of his landlords, Carol Mair. She told him she expects rent on April 1 (the shops were open for half of March) but was willing to discuss a compromise if closings dragged on.
"If this thing goes longer, and there is no subsidy for rent, I don't know how I'm going to survive," Mr. Hammell said. "This rent goes to her being able to survive, too."
Ms. Mair still isn't sure what kind of relief she'll be able to access as a landlord, but wants to be compassionate. "Whatever breaks I can get, I can then give breaks to my tenant," she said.
Even with financial relief from the federal government's 75-per-cent wage subsidy for small businesses, rent remains a substantial fixed cost for commercial tenants.
Ottawa has not introduced specific financial aid to help commercial property landlords. Banks are considering sixmonth mortgage deferrals for small businesses, including property owners, and some municipalities have postponed realty taxes for two months.
But many landlords and tenants have little idea what, or when, relief will arrive.

Full text: The Bank of Canada's third interest rate cut in March is not expected to boost the country's real estate market, which has slowed significantly over the past week along with the rest of the economy because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
"The rate cut won't do much to stop the housing market from grinding to a virtual halt in many parts of the country as a result of social, physical distancing orders and or outright real estate industry lockdown," said Robert Hogue, senior economist with Royal Bank of Canada.
After the first 50 basis point rate cut on March 4, major lenders responded by cutting their fixed mortgage rates with some offering deals as low as 2.29 per cent for a five-year fixed mortgage. (There are 100 basis points in a percentage point.) Mortgage brokers and lenders were flooded with requests for new loans, refinancings and renewals.
But after the central bank announced its second 50 basis point rate cut on March 13, major lenders including Bank of Nova Scotia, Toronto-Dominion Bank and MCAP started raising some of their fixed mortgage rates. One bank said their funding costs were increasing.
Mortgage brokers attributed the higher borrowing costs to the rising risks for lenders to make loans with the economy falling into a recession.
On Friday, after the Bank of Canada's third 50 basis point interest rate cut to 0.25 per cent, lenders were still expected to increase their fixed mortgage rates.
If banks cut their prime lending rate, homeowners with a variable mortgage rate and Canadians with a line of credit would pay less interest on their loan. (The variable rate is tied to the lender's prime rate.)
"Borrowers on floating rates can benefit directly from the Bank of Canada moves. But such relief is for now being swamped by the closure of much of the economy," said Douglas Porter, chief economist with BMO.
The banks have been inundated with requests for mortgage payment deferrals as thousands of Canadians lose jobs and entire industries shut down.
Meanwhile, real estate activity in Toronto, Ottawa and elsewhere in Southern and Eastern Ontario had been strong up until early last week with properties fetching multiple offers and overasking prices. But as the number of coronavirus cases increase and job losses mount, sales and listings have been drying up.
"Some really need to buy or sell but everyone else is putting their plans on hold. A lot of buyers are reluctant to go out and look," said Christopher Alexander, Re/Max's regional director for Ontario and Eastern Canada.
"There is more concern about jobs," he said.
Vancouver, Victoria and other cities' housing markets have also slowed, according to local realtors.
However, the rock-bottom interest rates - the lowest since the 2009 financial crisis - are expected to help the Canadian economy recover in the future.
"When the worst of the crisis has passed, rates are likely to remain low for an extended period of time, to help support a forceful recovery. And housing will likely play a big role in that recovery," Mr. Porter said.

Full text: The money that normally flows into Gordon Bohlmann's small physiotherapy business in south Vancouver stopped dead last week, after he became one of the many businesses forced to close because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Now, he's facing a $10,000 rent payment in less than a week with no money to pay it. He can't reach his landlord in person and he's heard no word from any level of government about any help for people like him - small, independent business owners that can no longer operate because of increasingly restrictive policies aimed at reducing personto-person contact.
"They're going to have to provide some relief and it has to be done quickly," said Mr. Bohlmann, who has operated Marpole Physiotherapy for 20 years. "Our bank account just doesn't have the money."
He is one of thousands of small and medium-sized business owners across the country who feel as though they are invisible, as governments scramble to provide help for renters, employees and, it seems at times, almost everyone else.
In Western Canada, businesses are facing different variations of a similar problem, depending on where they are located. Increasing property taxes and a tight real estate market were already squeezing businesses in the Vancouver region, while in Alberta, a stubbornly sluggish economy had left the balance sheets of many companies and landlords in dire circumstances even before the latest turmoil from the pandemic.
"They just don't feel heard. It's now Day 10 and the overall sentiment is that ... we need to reduce their fixed costs," said Sandip Lalli, chief executive officer of the Calgary Chamber of Commerce. "It's great we're stabilizing others and there's one-to-one help. But companies are saying, ‘I need my business stabilized so that I can build in resilience and gainfully employ people again.' " Business advocates are calling for government help while also asking landlords to work with their tenants to offer flexibility, through measures such as reducing or deferring rent payments.
"B.C. came out with a renters' program, but that's just for residences; small businesses are struggling, too," said Muriel Protzer, a policy analyst with the B.C. branch of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business.
"We were hoping to see commercial and industrial tenants in that."
Neil Wyles, who runs the Mount Pleasant business improvement association, said private landlords and tenants need to work together to negotiate some kind of temporary plan.
"If a landlord has a tenant now, that is a bird in the hand that he should keep. I think the reality is that a lot of businesses are not going to weather this. There will be a glut of space after this," Mr. Wyles said.
Jeff Jamieson, co-owner of the Proof cocktail bar and Donna Mac restaurant in downtown Calgary, said many restaurants are enduring week-to-week. They simply won't survive if they are forced to pay rent - potentially for months without any revenue coming in.
"I think we're in the same situation as most: We're out of dough," said Mr. Jamieson, who also co-owns the Vine Arts wine and liquor stores, which remain open.
"It's impossible now with no money in the bank. You're going to see a lot of closures."
Mr. Jamieson said he's been negotiating with his landlords, although with April 1 quickly approaching, they face a tight deadline to figure something out. He said governments could do more to help commercial tenants and their landlords defer rental payments.
"We don't want to step way from our obligations and we're not trying to take advantage of a bad situation," he said.
"It's simply the fact that if you want these businesses to be here in three or four months so people can get hired back and the rent can keep coming back in, something needs to be done today."
Governments have announced various measures to help businesses and property owners, though none specifically targeted at rental relief.
The federal government has offered wage subsidies for small employers while Ottawa and provincial governments have extended tax filing deadlines. There are low-interest federal loans available to some companies and major banks have announced mortgage payment deferrals in some circumstances.
Local governments, for example in Vancouver and Calgary, have allowed property tax deferrals or are considering it.
In Vancouver, all property taxes, normally due at the beginning of July, have been deferred two months. In Alberta, payments for workers' compensation have been deferred and the City of Calgary was considering deferring property taxes in a meeting Thursday.
Percy Woods of BOMA Edmonton, which represents commercial building owners and property managers, said that sort of relief should make it easier for landlords to help tenants. He said many landlords, particularly privately owned local and regional players, are in the same boat as tenants, with few options to cover their bills if rental payments dry up.
"It's a lot easier to work with somebody that's in place and find somebody to replace them," he said.
"We've got to keep the business is going on. From our perspective, the best way for that to happen is to get popped up for a short time and defer."

A textile-factory loft weaves in new and old

Full text: 5265 Ave. De Gaspé, apt. 203 MONTREAL Asking Price: $895,000 Taxes: $4,672 (Municipal, 2020); $765 (School, 2019) Monthly maintenance fees: $486 Size: 1,800 square feet Agents: Jeff Lee and Marie-Claude Bergeron, Engel & Völkers Montréal THE BACKSTORY Selling a high-end loft in the entrepreneurial hot-bed of Montreal's Mile End should be as easy as falling off a log. And in any other market it would be, but it's not a done deal yet and the timing has Jeff Lee of Engel & Völkers worrying over whether this is the last transaction he'll record in 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic crashes into every sector of the economy.
"The deals we're securing right now are probably our money for the spring into the summer," he said. The hope is the virus will be under control in the fall. Until then, he'll sweat even sure bets such as the 1,800-square-foot loft that is one of only 31 apartments at Lofts de Gaspé, a fourstorey former textile factory converted to housing about eight years ago.
When the sellers, Francis Gosselin and Gabrielle Madé, moved here three years ago it was love at first sight.
"We weren't really looking for a place ... we visited only this on, and made an offer the same day," said Mr. Gosselin, an economist and consultant who was working in Mile End at the time.
"We travel quite a lot for work and we think it's one of the coolest places to live. It's mostly offices for technology, [video game giant] Ubisoft has more than 3,000 workers on the street. It's the No. 1 street for guys walking around in T-shirts with six-digit salaries," Mr. Gosselin said.
"The zone where it's residential has artists and small boutiques, there are not any brands in the neighbourhood: not one MacDonald's or Tim's. Only places like Café Olimpico that are all pretending to be the best at their craft. It's a short walk to St. Viateur or Fairmont [famed rival Montreal bagel shops] depending on which church you pray too."
"Mile End has been raging for years now," Mr. Lee said.
"Montreal is still the best kept secret in North America: it's a real city, but still very cheap to live in." THE HOUSE TODAY The loft is essentially a long rectangle that has been subdivided into as few separate spaces as possible. From the door you can see in a straight line to the windows at the opposite end that fills the space with light, bouncing off the polished concrete floor.
Closest to the door are storage closets and the laundry space, but just beyond that is a vast kitchen - 27 feet long - separated from the hall by a long white island with double sink and a glasstopped electric range. The original owners, a duo of graphic designers who bought it from plans, opted not to have a builder kitchen and had a custom one installed once they moved in. A full wall of cabinets on both ends of the space - one a pantry and wine storage and the other side with fridge and wall-mounted oven and microwave - bracket a wide expanse of the exposed concrete wall that has nothing but decorative storage shelving. There is another unique feature on that wall: a sort of tapestry of tea towels, a concept the couple copied from the original owners by having all their housewarming guests bring a piece of jacquard fabric as a gift.
Opposite the kitchen is an office space that is tucked away behind a custom bookshelf, not walled off but see-through. A huge steel support beam adds to the factory feel in what could be a second bedroom with some creative fixes. The bookshelf, made by a local woodworking artisan, comes with the loft: "It weighs 800 pounds, and our next place could not fit it," Mr. Gosselin said.
Around the bookcase is the liv-
ing/dining room, which is 34 feet long and really sells that loft feeling.
"It's a huge place per Montreal standards, in square footage and the ceilings are 12 feet high," Mr. Gosselin said. "We have had several thematic parties, like May the Fourth, for Star Wars - we had more than 100 people in the room. We had an art show with Olicorno, he used our apartment for a full day - invited some of his buyers and enthusiasts - he sold them all in one day."
Along one wall is a vast collection of books, colour-coded but definitely read by these bibliophiles. But even with that the space almost feels underfurnished even with a sectional couch, a dining room and a few modernist chairs spread about.
The wall of square-paned windows frames the room, and the loft, and looks across to more busy urban life.
Ms. Madé was until recently a talent manager for online influencers and the Instagram-worthy loft and neighbourhood have often served as a backdrop in her clients' content: videos, photoshoots, even a TV show about technology.
FAVOURITE SPACE "I became a Lush addict because of the bath in the bedroom, it's absolutely great to take a bath in the room that's not the bathroom," Ms Madé said. The standalone bath sits tastefully back from the windows, along the wall that separates the master bedroom from the en suite with huge dark-tiled walk-in shower and closet space. Her favourite product? A tough one, but she prefers to fill her bedroom with the scent of the the lush "Peachy" bath bomb, that is indeed shaped like a ripe fruit.
Once, a client of hers, "YouTubeuse" Rosalie Lessard, even did a photoshoot in her precious bath ... filling it with milk and Froot Loops cereal and then submerging herself almost entirely in it.
"I don't enjoy the bath stuff," said Mr. Gosselin, who prefers the shower. But the openness (there is no door to the bedroom) reminds him of another selling point: they have two dogs and "1,800 square feet without any doors makes a great playing field.
The dogs loved it, they could run all the way to the end of the house and back." There's also a dog park about 800 metres away, past all those boutiques and tech bros.
Their next place has a similar feel, but is about five kilometres closer to downtown Montreal near where Ms. Madé's new job will be. Surprise: it's another converted industrial space, former home to printing presses for the Gazette and La Presse.
"You're living in something that had roots and history," she said. "These are the best places to live in: you are borrowing the history for a short time."

Full text: ‘I love hotels," said Mark Harmon, founder of Auberge Resorts Collection, as he opened his 2017 Ted Talk. "A hotel holds the promise, everyday, of adventure and romance, of intrigue, mystery, betrayal, affairs of the heart, dangerous liaisons; where else can you find that in fiction and in film?" Mr. Harmon, who admitted during "The Soul of a Hotel" that he'd unwittingly created a hotel with no soul (and then divested it), went on to list the four elements that go into creating something so "intangible" as soul: "Great design; a sense of place; a connection or being a part of the community in which the hotel is located; that the hotel inspires great affection or love through and for the people working there."
I was thinking about these things as I got out of my car at the intersection of King and Queen Streets in downtown Kitchener, Ont., just last week.
There, a great pile of red bricks, The Walper Hotel, has commanded the southwest corner since 1893, when Abel Walper hired architect Jonas Knechtel to design a Beaux-Arts building to replace the 1820 inn that Phineas Varnum had built (which his brother, Curry Walper, would purchase in 1886) but had been destroyed by fire.
While not much is known about Mr. Knechtel - the Biographical Dictionary of Architects in Canada lists only that the locally born builder-turned-architect died the year after the hotel opened at the age of 52, that his son, Charles, took over and that Knechtel may have been the only practicing architect in what was then the Town of Berlin - we do know that he had talent. The Walper's brickwork is refined and delicate, the window placement is rhythmic and pleasing, and the cornice is striking and bold.
So that takes care of Mr. Harmon's first two requirements.
The third, that connection to the community, is harder to confirm, since the grand old dame has recently undergone a reset of sorts by the Perimeter Development Corp., which purchased the property in 2013 for $4.65-million.
(Perimeter was joined by partners Zehr Group, David Struke, and hotel managers CK Atlantis Ltd., with an announced renovation budget of $3.5-million.) Slowly, as Perimeter transformed the dated old hotel into a hip boutique hotel worthy of Kitchener-Waterloo's new status as "Silicone Valley North" and long-time businesses, such as the barber shop (which was replaced by a different barber shop), the dollar store and the pub were given their walking papers, one might argue that the old soul had been yanked out as well.
Or, perhaps that soul had already evaporated: "The hotel was in, not full disrepair, but it was no longer what it once had been," began Elie Newman, a principal at BNKC Architecture, who also recounted the local folklore of the once-proud Walper as counting Louis Armstrong, the Queen Mother, Eleanor Roosevelt, and various Canadian prime ministers as overnight guests. "Gradually it does what many of these hotels do. It's a residential hotel, people are living here, it's all cut up. I won't dwell on it, but by the time you get to when it was bought, it was no longer in its heyday."
The same could be said of Toronto's bookends, the Gladstone and the Broadview hotels, now both owned by Streetcar Developments. Before their transformations, these were not places one might hold a business meeting, unless that "business" involved illegal substances. Today, however, because of great care in how each reset was managed, and by involving architects and designers who exhibit sensitivity for each individual building's history, soul has returned.
At the Walper, says Mr. Newman, a similar (and soulful) team was assembled. Starting at the top of his own firm with Joseph Bogden, who cut his heritage teeth with the award-winning College Park (Toronto) restoration and reimagining in the late-1960s, to Jill Greaves Design and Dubbeldam Architecture + Design (for work on the guest rooms), and Dialogue 38 (for the lobby and public spaces), all the way to how the new retailers have curated their spaces, there has been much blood, sweat and tears put into the place.
The key was to take things slowly, Mr. Newman explained.
"This was part of the first phase, I think it was 2018," the architect said as the elevator door opened to the sexy, wine cellar-like design of TWH Social Bar & Bistro in the basement. "This place is really popular now; you come in here for a business lunch or something and it can be fairly busy."
Does that mean Mr. Harmon's third requirement has been met?
Up in the hotel's famous Crystal Ballroom, Mr. Newman elaborated on the phased approach and how each of the five floors was presented to the public only when completely ready. He also spoke of structural problems, both large and small, that his team faced: Since the hotel had been expanded over the years - early photos show a four-storey building with a one-storey high corner tower and others show a buff brick building to the west that was absorbed - there was an odd truss system buried inside the demising walls (with major components cut) and, on a smaller scale, so many subtle changes in flooring heights that a complete levelling out was necessary.
Adding modern HVAC and a sprinkler system was no picnic either.
"They're so much fun to work on, they're one big royal pain in the ass to work on," Mr. Newman said with a smile as we gathered our things in the lobby. "It's always these little wrinkles that you get, it's never boring, it's never the same thing."
Just before I left, I asked the desk staff about the announcement to close the hotel for a month due to the COVID-19 crisis.
As they spoke, I could see the deep concern in their eyes ... then again, with "great affection" comes great sadness. Check the box on No. 4.
The Walper Hotel recently won the Lieutenant-Governer's Ontario Heritage Award for Excellence in Conservation. The 92-room hotel plans to reopen on April 22, 2020.

Full text: With the Tokyo Olympics postponed until 2021, now comes the multibillion-dollar question: Who pays the bills for the delay, and how large will they be?
The most likely answer is: primarily Japanese taxpayers.
"Of course there will be costs," organizing committee CEO Toshiro Muto said when the postponement was announced. "As for how much, we have no figures with us right now. As for who will shoulder these costs?
Needless to say, they are not going to be easy discussions, so we are not sure how long they will take."
The Japanese financial newspaper Nikkei put the added cost at US$2.7-billion, citing an estimate from local organizers.
Tokyo organizers will have to renegotiate new leases on venues, pay for maintenance at arenas and maybe find different fields of play. They will also have to deal with real estate developers who are already selling off thousands of apartments at what will be the athletes village. The organizing committee also employs 3,500 staff members, and some may lose their jobs to cost cutting.
Tokyo, driven by advertising giant Dentsu Inc., has sold US$3.3-billion in local sponsorships, more than twice any previous Olympics. Those brands will be clamouring to know what they get for their money. Refunds? Make-good deals? New contracts?
And nothing much can be done until new dates are set to replace what was to be this year's Olympics: July 24 through Aug.
9, 2020.
"The general target is summer of next year," said Yoshiro Mori, president of the organizing committee and a former Japanese prime minister. "We have to go through scheduling, international events. Many things will have to be adjusted before we come up with a certain time frame."
Of course, all of the rescheduling problems are compounded by the uncertain spread of the virus and the recent downturn in the economy.
Muto acknowledged tough talks are ahead with the International Olympic Committee, which controls the games but leaves the host country to pick up most of the costs.
First, some Tokyo Olympic financing basics.
Local organizers and Japanese government bodies say they are spending US$12.6-billion to put on the Olympics. However, a national government audit report in December put costs at US$28billion. There is always debate about what are - and are not - Olympic costs, and creative accounting is not unknown.
When Tokyo won the Olympic bid in 2013, it said the total cost would be US$7.3-billion.
Private-sector money makes up US$5.6-billion of today's total budget. The rest - whatever the grand total - is public money.
Tokyo has spent almost US$7billion on temporary and permanent venues - about 85 per cent from public funds. The most expensive venue is the new national stadium, a national government project billed at US$1.43billion.
For its part, the Switzerlandbased IOC has contributed US$1.3-billion to finance the Tokyo Olympics, a small fraction of the total cost. The IOC had income of US$5.7-billion for the last four-year Olympic cycle (2013-16). Almost three-quarters of the income is from selling broadcasting rights, with another 18 per cent from sponsors.
The IOC also has a reserve fund of about US$2-billion, and insurance to cover losses.
Bent Flyvbjerg, an author of The Oxford Olympics Study 2016: Cost and Cost Overrun at the Games, said in an e-mail to The Associated Press that the IOC should share more of the costs, and termed it a "monopoly." The study found the Olympics have the "highest average cost overrun of any type of mega-project."
Flyvbjerg said the IOC should "pick up a larger part of the bill for the games, which the IOC profits from. Tokyo and Japan will pick up the added cost, unless the IOC makes an exception and expands the reserve fund, which is what the IOC should do from an ethics point of view."
Tokyo was planning to use 42 venues for 33 sports. One extra venue was planned for the Paralympics. Muto said it was not clear how many venues would be available a year from now.
"Some venues we might have to keep renting until next year," he said. "Because at some venues it takes about a year to get them ready. We can't take them down and then set them up again for the Olympics. That also means added costs."
The biggest headache could be the athletes village, which is to house 11,000 Olympians and staff, and 4,400 Paralympians and staff. The sprawling site on Tokyo Bay - 5,632 apartments - is to be sold off after the Olympics and reports say one-quarter have already been sold. Some cost more than US$1-million.
One of the developers, Mitsui Fudosan Co., said it has suspended sales at the complex, which will include 23 buildings.
Even lining up 80,000 unpaid volunteers again could be expensive and create more work. The city of Tokyo was also planning to use 30,000 added volunteers to help fans find train lines and street addresses, and dish out general help for non-Japanese speakers.
Ticket demand has also been unprecedented with 7.8 million available, and demand exceeding supply by 10 times. Ticket sales are expected to raise about US$1-billion for local organizers.
All tickets have a force majeure clause, which might get organizers off the hook of paying refunds if the coronavirus is deemed to be "beyond Tokyo 2020's reasonable control."
"We don't have a final conclusion about what our policy will be," Muto said. "As much as possible, we want to make sure that people who have already bought tickets will get special consideration."

Retailers seek rent relief as shopping centres close

Full text: With malls closing and shops deserted because of provincial shutdowns and the coronavirus pandemic, retail tenants are scrambling for relief from their landlords.
Some say they will refuse to pay the rent and others are asking for a waiver or a deferral as federal and local governments clamp down on activity and tell Canadians to stay at home.
"We are definitely considering withholding rent. We don't have the sales from the previous month to provide us with rent for April," said Brad Chenkis, owner of After Five Fashion, a family-run evening wear store that leases space in a Cadillac Fairview mall in Richmond, B.C.
"We saw a massive decline in shoppers. Our sales have hit an all-time low."
Cadillac Fairview, which runs 19 malls across the country, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
Quebec's provincial government told movie-theatre chain Cinémas Guzzo to close its doors as of March 15. Chief executive Vince Guzzo has sent letters to the landlords at his cinema properties, informing them that he would not be paying rent as long as the theatres remained closed.
He said he would defer those payments and add them on to the end of his leases.
Also a landlord himself, Mr. Guzzo said he has provided similar flexibility to his tenants. "If mortgage payments are suspended, landlords really don't need the money," he said. "The biggest fear we all have is to keep our cash flow available for the real emergencies."
Vanessa Yakobson, CEO of Blo Blow Dry Bar, said the franchisees who operate the chain of hair-styling salons have asked their landlords for rent relief and have yet to hear back.
The chain has locations in Ontario and British Columbia, as well as across the United States.
Leases, which include force majeure clauses that cover events outside of the parties' control, typically require the tenant to continue paying the rent.
Events such as "rebellion, insurrection and act of God," can delay services but does not "excuse the tenant from payment of rent or the landlord from payment of amount that it is required to pay," one mall tenant's lease viewed by The Globe and Mail said.
"People are looking at the force majeure clauses in their leases, which deftly preclude situations such as this," Ms. Yakobson said.
It's a huge problem for retail landlords and their tenants, both of which have bills to pay.
In Ontario and Quebec, three major mall operators closed their shopping centres after provinces halted non-essential work.
Oxford Properties, Ivanhoé Cambridge and Cadillac Fairview have shuttered their malls in the provinces with only drugstores and some food retail open. That includes well-known malls in Toronto, Oxford's Yorkdale and Cadillac Fairview's Eaton Centre, which, like all other shopping centres, have suffered from a precipitous drop in traffic in March.
They are continuing to operate in other provinces at reduced hours and are only allowing takeout at their food courts.
Some landlords have been pro-active with their tenants.
Ivanhoé Cambridge, the real estate company owned by the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, is deferring rent for their mall tenants in Quebec.
Ivanhoé Cambridge has not provided relief for Ontario tenants, although has said it is "evaluating similar scenarios in the different provinces" in which it operates.
Neither Oxford nor Cadillac Fairview has said publicly whether it would offer tenants relief.
Walmart Canada said on Wednesday that it would waive rent for a two-month period for the hundreds of tenants that operate shops within its stores.
Many of those shops, including hair salons, lottery shops, nail salons and others, have had to close their doors because of the shutdown.
"The idea that they would have to pay rent in a situation where they're either forced to shut down or might be operating but not at the same level of customers would be a significant burden," said Rob Nicol, Walmart Canada's vice-president of corporate affairs.
Walmart Canada is among the few retailers, including grocers, discount stores and drugstores, that have seen a jump in sales as Canadians race to stock up on food, toilet paper and other supplies.
Meanwhile, malls and other retailers are virtually empty if not closed.
"The landlord needs the rent to pay their obligations," said Alex Arifuzzaman, a retail real estate consultant. "Morally, however, it is a conundrum. Almost like a game of musical chairs.
How can they pay rent if they are legally obligated to shut down?" After a report on Tuesday that Subway Restaurants had sent a letter to landlords in the U.S. saying it might delay or cut rent payments, Subway Canada said it had not sent such letters but is helping franchisees to navigate rent abatement, reduction and deferral.
RioCan REIT and SmartCentres REIT have said they are deferring rent on a case-by-case basis for tenants that have suffered great losses owing to the coronavirus crisis.
But tenants don't even think a deferral is enough with no revenue coming in.
"The fear is that even if these payments get tacked on at the end, these aren't people who are generating tons and tons of cash flow," Ms. Yakobson said.
"To put them in a position where they need to set aside thousands of dollars to make deferred rent payments, that's only going to contribute to economic strife down the road."

Home building gets an alternative approach

Full text: When Toronto City Council last month approved the final plan for a locally contentious mixed-income apartment development near Wilson subway station, the number of affordable rental units was actually 25 per cent higher than the initial proposal, which was made public only a year ago.
"That's probably the first time ever that the City of Toronto's affordable housing process has added hundreds of units during the consultation process," Mark Richardson, spokesperson for a grassroots advocacy organization called Housing NowTO, says.
The group's name is a reference to a council strategy, first bruited by Mayor John Tory, to develop 10,000 new market and affordable apartments on 11 cityowned parcels, several of them near subway stations. Unlike an earlier generation of city land deals, these sites won't be sold to developers, but rather leased for 99-year terms to property management firms and non-profits.
While council approved the Housing Now policy, responsibility for delivering on its promise has fallen to a newly ascendant municipal agency called CreateTO, which has emerged as an influential and closely watched player in the often byzantine process of redeveloping city land.
Headed by long-time Mattamy Homes executive Brian Johnston, CreateTO grew out of the 2018 merger of two arm's length city agencies - the Toronto Port Lands Corp. and Build TO - that were tasked with managing or selling municipal real estate, but often ended up feuding with city hall, or one another.
CreateTO, officials say, embodies an alternative philosophy about the raison d'être of cityowned real estate - a giant portfolio that includes 8,000 parcels of land ranging from tiny parkettes to sprawling brownfield sites. As Mr. Johnston explains, the city saw that it has to take a more strategic approach to those assets instead of either using them for one purpose only or selling off surplus land to builders. "Taking a holistic view of all these assets is just common sense," he says. "We don't have a profit motive. We have a public good motive."
The agency has also been directly involved with a push by the city to rationalize its office space, now spread across 52 locations. As well, CreateTO is in the process of absorbing Toronto Community Housing's highly integrated development and construction division, which has been responsible for rebuilding and intensifying older public housing complexes, such as Lawrence Heights. CreateTO is also overseeing higher profile redevelopment projects for sites such as the TTC head office and the Etobicoke Civic Centre.
Toronto-Danforth councillor Paula Fletcher, a CreateTO director, says the agency's mandate reflects a growing awareness that the city-building potential of all those far-flung land holdings far exceeds whatever financial windfall they may have generated on the open market.
RioCan president Jonathan Gitlin adds that CreateTO has been set up to allow the city to bring development deals to fruition far more quickly than was the case under the previous system, which gave every municipal department the right of first refusal on any parcel slated to be sold. "It's certainly an improvement from what they had before," he says. "It makes for a more fluid system."
Mr. Johnston, who has been in the job for a year, is described as a forthright, no-nonsense developer who is eager to get deals done but wants to be measured by his ability to make a dent in the city's affordable housing shortage. He says he was initially skeptical about consummating lease-based development deals that didn't involve a land sale.
But he now believes there's a strong market for such arrangements, especially among institutional funds that invest in purpose-build rental buildings and won't be spooked by a looming pandemic-induced recession.
The CreateTO backstory traces to amalgamation, in 1998, when the city's real estate holdings were divvied up among 24 departments and agencies, each with its own competing land agenda. The result is that many sites are single-use parcels (e.g., libraries, fire halls, community centres), often with plenty of surface parking.
The Toronto Parking Authority, in particular, has long held on to lands that sit directly adjacent to subway stations. (Several are now on CreateTO's radar as future mixed-income apartment complexes that will be part of the Housing Now strategy.)
Mr. Tory and his advisers had their eyes on the fractured real estate division as early as 2014.
After he was elected, city officials created, for the first time, a comprehensive registry of all those parcels, as well as a centralized list of future land requirements for city facilities that were slated to be expanded or rebuilt.
Insiders say city officials had a wake-up call back in 2013, when BuildTO, the agency responsible for selling surplus municipal real estate, threatened to go to the Ontario Municipal Board over the city's own plan for a Front Street site that once held the Greyhound Bus terminal. The unseemly intramural bickering offered vivid proof that a city agency mandated to maximize the return on land value was willing to ignore other city priorities.
That outlook has been shelved, as have BuildTO's more recent plans to sell off several choice commuter parking lots to developers. Instead, Mr. Johnston cites the example of an aging fire hall on Adelaide Street West, near John Street. CreateTO will build a new station on the Metro Hall lands and is combining the previous site with a cityowned parking lot immediately to the north, on Richmond Street West. Mr. Johnston says his planners are developing a precinct plan so whatever goes up on those now conjoined downtown lots will provide a range of amenities, including open space, a daycare centre, as well as a mix of housing types.
Some CreateTO projects have run into roadblocks - local councillors objecting to a loss of parking, as happened with the Wilson site, or residents complaining about too much density.
When it was established, council gave the agency all sorts of clout to ensure it didn't become ensnared in bureaucratic battles or local backlash. But, Mr. Johnston says, he's more interested in moving the Housing Now deals along expeditiously than obtaining consensus. "I'd rather not worry about getting every site absolutely correct," he says.
Deputy mayor Ana Bailao, who also sits on the CreateTO board and represents the Davenport ward, insists this influential new player won't be running roughshod over the concerns of communities and local councillors. But, she adds, the municipality has no choice but to engage in "tough conversations" about the need for more affordable housing in a city with a 1per-cent vacancy rate, skyrocketing rents and increasingly unattainable house prices.
Says Ms. Bailao: "People have realized that there's going to be some changes if your son, your daughter or your mother is going to continue to live in the city."

Full text: DONE DEAL
1500 Alberni St., No. 12C, Vancouver WEST END Asking price: $1.599-million Selling price: $1.599-million Days on market: 19 Taxes; $4,614.41 (2019) Monthly maintenance fee: $883.54 Buyer's agent: Nicolas Blachette, Re/Max Crest Realty THE ACTION Nicolas Blachette, the buyer's agent, says the unit sold because of its unusually large square footage.
It amounts to $965 for each square foot, which is reasonable in the prime location, within steps to Robson Street and Coal Harbour. The seller was a longtime owner and the buyer plans to live in the unit. The deal closed in January.
WHAT THEY GOT This 1,657-squarefoot West End unit with views of Stanley Park is in a luxury tower that was built in 1992, when units tended to be bigger.
It has a balcony, two bedrooms, three bathrooms, a family room, foyer, walk-in closets, air conditioning, nine-foot ceilings, 24-hour concierge, two parking spaces and storage locker. The unit could use a few updates, such as new appliances, according to Mr. Blachette.
THE AGENT'S TAKE "Not many buyers are looking to purchase over $1.5-million downtown right now," Mr. Blachette said. "The majority of buyers in this price range are locals upsizing or downsizing from their existing home, or Canadians who are relocating, coming back home."

Full text: One of Canada's biggest commercial property landlords said it is deferring rent for its retailers in Quebec and others are working on rent deferrals for their hardest hit tenants, as the country shuts down in an attempt to stop the novel coronavirus from spreading.
Ivanhoé Cambridge, which operates 22 malls across the country, said the rent reprieve is aimed at alleviating the liquidity problems of tenants at its shopping centres in Quebec and to support the province's economy. Shops, restaurants and other businesses have seen their revenue evaporate after local and federal governments closed schools, halted non-essential activity and told Canadians to stay at home.
"We are implementing exceptional measures in order to respond to an exceptional situation. Each of us must do our part to support the well-being of our community," said Nathalie Palladitcheff, CEO of Ivanhoé Cambridge, the real estate company owned by the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec.
The province's economy minister said Ivanhoé would announce a six month moratorium on rent. However, the company said the length of the deferment will be determined "according to the evolution of the situation." Ivanhoé said it is evaluating similar scenarios in the other provinces in which it operates. Other retail operators said they were getting requests from their tenants.
"The bulk of our tenants are supermarkets, drugstores, Costcos and they don't need any help," said Ed Sonshine, CEO of RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust, one of the country's largest property owners with malls, shopping plazas, offices and apartments in major cities.
"But then you have tenants like the nail store and it is not life as usual.
"With those tenants, we are going to work with them. We are not going to start forgiving rent because we can't, but we will certainly work on deferrals and so on."
It's a similar situation at SmartCentres REIT, which operates 165 retail plazas in the country and leases space to 115 Walmarts.
Although business has spiked at grocers and discount stores such as Walmart, many other retailers are facing mounting bills without any revenue.
"I spoke this week with one small independent retailer whose business is very affected by the virus and I assured them that we have every intention to stand by her and help her through this, even if it includes a form of rent deferral," said Mitchell Goldhar, chief executive of SmartCentres, adding that very few tenants have requested deferrals and of those, all are small businesses and they make up less than 5 per cent of its space.
The country's other big mall operators, Cadillac Fairview and Oxford Properties, have kept their properties open but are allowing only takeout from restaurants in their food courts. Spokespeople for the two real estate companies declined to comment on rent deferrals.
Malls, along with department stores and other physical retailers, were already under pressure to retool their business with growing competition from Amazon.com Inc. and other online retailers. Now with Canadians staying at home, dozens of retailers are closed or empty.
"Top of mind is not buying a new jacket for spring," Mr. Sonshine said. "Business, except for the essentials, is slowing down dramatically for everyone."
The slowdown is also affecting owners of office buildings, where cafés and other shops typically occupy the basement and ground floor. In Toronto, the country's financial capital and biggest job market, offices are virtually empty after federal and provincial governments urged people to work from home.
"If the government is telling the store to shut down, how does the store pay the rent?" said Alex Arifuzzaman, owner of retail real estate adviser InterStratics Consultants Inc.
Dream Office REIT, which owns 32 office properties, most of which are in Toronto, said right now it is mostly retail, not office tenants, that are feeling the pain.
"It is still very early in this so we are just talking now. Mostly the retail tenants are struggling," Dream CEO Michael Cooper said.
Brookfield Asset Management, one of the largest property owners globally with two dozen office towers in Toronto, Ottawa and Calgary, has not received many requests but is considering rent deferrals on a case-by-case basis for its hardest hit tenants, according to a person close to Brookfield. The Globe and Mail granted confidentiality because the person was not permitted to speak publicly.
Toronto Mayor John Tory is asking landlords to help small businesses on the timing of rent payments in light of the severe cash-flow difficulties many are facing, according to his spokesman, Don Peat. "Getting through this pandemic requires an effort from everyone."

Alberta economy reels as oil prices plummet

Full text: Eileen Kelly had already been out of work for several months and scratching around for something - anything - when oil prices fell off a cliff early in the new year.
Ms. Kelly, a born-and-raised Albertan who has worked at oil and gas companies for decades, most recently working on regulatory documents, had been through this before, having been laid off at the bottom of the province's recession in 2016.
It took her two years to find full-time work at Accel Energy Ltd. But late last year, the company filed for protection from creditors as it became one of many small oil companies that were no longer able to pay their bills.
In recent weeks, as she waited for signs that Alberta economy was turning itself around, there were suddenly ominous headlines about pandemics, a possible global recession and an energy industry caught in a punishing international price war.
"You just don't even want to hear any more terrible news," said Ms. Kelly, 54, who lives in Calgary. "It's just doom and gloom everywhere you look."
Ms. Kelly, whose family has been able to make do on her husband's salary, EI benefits and odd jobs she's been able to pick up, said it was already difficult to even get a job interview in a depressed market.
The combined hit of the rapidly escalating COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Saudi price war that sent oil prices crashing this past week could not have come at a worse time for her family - and the entire province.
"You just can't win. It's frustrating," Ms. Kelly said.
Despite decades of discussion of economic diversification, Alberta's economy remains dependent on the vagaries of global crude markets. And it has been reeling for years.
The province was still shaking off the effects of the financial crisis when oil prices plunged in late 2014.
That set off a two-year recession that pushed tens of thousands of people out of work.
The recovery since then has been painfully slow, and in recent months there were already signs that it had been grinding to a halt, or that Alberta was sliding backward.
Now, the novel coronavirus outbreak is weakening demand for oil and depressing prices, placing even greater pressure on the economy and the provincial government's finances.
The oil price crash, which has brought prices for benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude down to about US$30 a barrel, from above US$60 at the start of the year, has turned the renewed unease about Alberta's economy into a full-blown crisis.
The historic rout in oil prices and resulting stock market swoon has done even more damage to the value of the province's dominant industry, oil and gas. It
had already been under financial pressure as investors turned their back on the sector after years of regulatory uncertainty and delays in adding badly needed export pipeline capacity.
The S&P/TSX Capped Energy Index has lost 53 per cent of its value over the past month, tumbling to an all-time low.
Alberta Premier Jason Kenney now warns of imminent layoffs and has signalled his government may have to abandon its plans to balance the budget two years from now.
"This is the worst I've seen in energy in my 20-year career," said Martin Pelletier, portfolio manager at Trivest Wealth Counsel in Calgary. "And it's getting worse, so buckle up."
From employment to insolvencies to real estate, the state of Alberta's economy appeared grim even before the events of the past few weeks.
Unemployment in the province was 7.2 per cent last month, about where it's been for the past two years, compared with a national average rate of of 5.6 per cent. The anemic labour market continues to hit young men the hardest.
When people lose their jobs, they are out of work for an average of about 20 weeks, and the province has a record incomesupport caseload of roughly 62,000.
Median home prices in Calgary and Edmonton are down about 1 per cent, year over year, after several years of steady declines, according to real estate boards in the two cities. Vacancies in Calgary's downtown office towers remain high.
The oil price crash has also cratered the Kenney government's budget, tabled last October, which projected a deficit this year of $6.8-billion on the assumption that the price for WTI would be US$58. Balancing in two years depended on prices reaching US$63 by then.
Critics said the price forecasts, as well as predictions for GDP growth and employment, were too optimistic. The past two weeks have added credence to that assessment.
Outside economists have suggested the Alberta government's revenue will fall at least $5-billion short of projections this year. Finance Minister Travis Toews said his department is still working out the numbers, but acknowledges those estimates are likely not far off.
"I wouldn't go a long ways to dispute that, but there's a lot of uncertainty and we really don't know where this is going to land," Mr. Toews said in an interview.
"We weren't fully recovered from the previous downturn, and so this catches us as a province at a weaker point."
The government has already signalled it doesn't intend to impose significantly steeper spending cuts and will be looking to increase stimulus, such as infrastructure spending in some areas.
In addition, the response to the COVID-19 outbreak will add pressure to health spending, something Mr. Toews said could be absorbed through contingencies already in the budget.
The oil price outlook had already darkened in early March as members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia met to discuss limiting output to guard against global economic weakness brought on by the coronavirus contagion.
The talks broke off with no agreement, however, and Saudi Arabia and Russia have dug in for what looks like a long price war to wrest market share from each other.
Over the past two weeks, the price of U.S. crude has declined by more than 30 per cent, settling on Friday at US$31.92 a barrel.
"When you look at pandemics, that's not new to commodity markets. When you look at price wars, that's certainly not new to commodity markets either. But we've never had both at the same time," said Michael Tran, managing director, Global Energy Strategy for RBC Capital Markets.
"We're dealing with a supply shock and a demand shock, and that's completely uncharted territory for the oil market."
With Russia and Saudi Arabia unlikely to blink any time soon, U.S. crude could average in the mid-US$30s a barrel for 2020, Mr. Tran said.
The Canadian oil sands and heavy oil benchmark, Western Canadian Select, was selling this past week at a discount to WTI of about US$12, putting its value at around US$19 a barrel.
At that level, Alberta's energy industry cannot operate profitably, and scores of companies have slashed capital spending or halted it altogether.
On Monday, Cenovus Energy Inc., the oil sands producer, slashed its capital expenditure program for the year by about $450-million, or 32 per cent. The move came soon after the company's shares lost more than half their value in a single session.
Husky Energy Inc. followed suit on Thursday with $1-billion of spending cuts and plans to shut down unprofitable production.
In Alberta, the oil crash is reverberating through the economy. Calgary's real estate market was setting up for another depressed year before this month's oil price crash.
Commercial real estate company Avison Young had predicted office vacancy at 24 per cent in 2020, up about a percentage point from last year, even with some expectation of an increase in local GDP.
Some towers, such as the former 37-floor former Nexen building on the west side of downtown, are empty.
The biggest hit has been to sub-premium properties outside the downtown core, where vacancies have topped 30 per cent.
That was the market served by Strategic Group, whose 56 Alberta buildings were forced into receivership in late 2019, leaving lenders and other creditors out more than $700-million, making it the largest casualty in the province's property market so far.
Gleaming new towers have only recently been completed in the core, adding to available square footage. Brookfield Place East, Eau Claire Tower and Telus Sky have pulled tenants away from older, lower-quality properties.
Alberta's hotels, also dependent on the energy economy, have bled revenue and guests since the price of oil plunged five years ago. As drilling and production activity in the energy sector contracted, small-town inns were no longer packed with oil workers, with average occupancy in 2016 dropping by 10 per cent from the year before.
The loss of corporate bookings was particularly acute in downtown Calgary, which went from being the best city hotel market in Canada to one of the worst in just half a decade.
Dave Kaiser, president and chief executive of the Alberta Hotels and Lodging Association, said it didn't help that Alberta added the most rooms of any province last year after projects planned during the boom finally opened their doors.
Mr. Kaiser said the fallout from COVID-19 is still unknown, but it will likely compound years of hurt with cancelled business events and general unease around travel.
"Is there light at the end of the tunnel? If there was, it seems like it's probably been shut off here with the events of the last couple of weeks," he said.

Full text: GIVING BACK The gift: Expanding Church Community Volunteers When Church Community Volunteers launched more than 50 years ago to drive elderly people to medical appointments in Mississauga, Lorna Kay was among the first drivers.
Lorna, now 84, is still a volunteer and, a few years ago, her daughter, Janet Kay, and son-inlaw, Bob Atkinson, joined as well.
Janet also became a board member, along with Mr. Atkinson, who is now president.
The charity provides free rides for dozens of people around southwest Mississauga and demand for the service has gone beyond the elderly. "We serve a lot of elderly people, but also people living on their own or not capable of driving, or who don't have family to help," said Janet, 53, who is a real estate agent. Her husband added: "If you're stuck and you have no way to get to an important medical appointment, what do you do? Sometimes you don't go."
The charity relies on financial support from a group of local churches and operates with close to 40 volunteer drivers. It was founded by a group of mothers who ran it largely during the school year. Janet and Mr. Atkinson hope to expand it into a year-round service. While they have been involved for about three years, some volunteers have been active for decades.
"We are simply carrying on the torch," Janet said.
"It's a great cause where there's an obvious need," said Mr. Atkinson, 60, who is semi-retired and previously worked in banking. "Most of these people are invisible in the community."
One of the drivers recently received a note from a woman who'd been given a lift. "I really appreciate this help," the note said. "It will change my life."

Full text: Eileen Kelly had already been out of work for several months and scratching around for something - anything - when oil prices fell off a cliff early in the new year.
Ms. Kelly, a born-and-raised Albertan who has worked at oil and gas companies for decades, most recently working on regulatory documents, had been through this before, having been laid off at the bottom of the province's recession in 2016.
It took her two years to find full-time work at Accel Energy Ltd. But late last year, the company filed for protection from creditors as it became one of many small oil companies that were no longer able to pay their bills.
In recent weeks, as she waited for signs that Alberta economy was turning itself around, there were suddenly ominous headlines about pandemics, a possible global recession and an energy industry caught in a punishing international price war.
"You just don't even want to hear any more terrible news," said Ms. Kelly, 54, who lives in Calgary. "It's just doom and gloom everywhere you look."
Ms. Kelly, whose family has been able to make do on her husband's salary, EI benefits and odd jobs she's been able to pick up, said it was already difficult to even get a job interview in a depressed market.
The combined hit of the rapidly escalating COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Saudi price war that sent oil prices crashing this past week could not have come at a worse time for her family - and the entire province.
"You just can't win. It's frustrating," Ms. Kelly said.
Despite decades of discussion of economic diversification, Alberta's economy remains dependent on the vagaries of global crude markets. And it has been reeling for years.
The province was still shaking off the effects of the financial crisis when oil prices plunged in late 2014.
That set off a two-year recession that pushed tens of thousands of people out of work.
The recovery since then has been painfully slow, and in recent months there were already signs that it had been grinding to a halt, or that Alberta was sliding backward.
Now, the novel coronavirus outbreak is weakening demand for oil and depressing prices, placing even greater pressure on the economy and the provincial government's finances.
The oil price crash, which has brought prices for benchmark West Texas Intermediate crude down to about US$30 a barrel, from above US$60 at the start of the year, has turned the renewed unease about Alberta's economy into a full-blown crisis.
The historic rout in oil prices and resulting stock market swoon has done even more damage to the value of the province's dominant industry, oil and gas. It
had already been under financial pressure as investors turned their back on the sector after years of regulatory uncertainty and delays in adding badly needed export pipeline capacity.
The S&P/TSX Capped Energy Index has lost 53 per cent of its value over the past month, tumbling to an all-time low.
Alberta Premier Jason Kenney now warns of imminent layoffs and has signalled his government may have to abandon its plans to balance the budget two years from now.
"This is the worst I've seen in energy in my 20-year career," said Martin Pelletier, portfolio manager at Trivest Wealth Counsel in Calgary. "And it's getting worse, so buckle up."
From employment to insolvencies to real estate, the state of Alberta's economy appeared grim even before the events of the past few weeks.
Unemployment in the province was 7.2 per cent last month, about where it's been for the past two years, compared with a national average rate of of 5.6 per cent. The anemic labour market continues to hit young men the hardest.
When people lose their jobs, they are out of work for an average of about 20 weeks, and the province has a record incomesupport caseload of roughly 62,000.
Median home prices in Calgary and Edmonton are down about 1 per cent, year over year, after several years of steady declines, according to real estate boards in the two cities. Vacancies in Calgary's downtown office towers remain high.
The oil price crash has also cratered the Kenney government's budget, tabled last October, which projected a deficit this year of $6.8-billion on the assumption that the price for WTI would be US$58. Balancing in two years depended on prices reaching US$63 by then.
Critics said the price forecasts, as well as predictions for GDP growth and employment, were too optimistic. The past two weeks have added credence to that assessment.
Outside economists have suggested the Alberta government's revenue will fall at least $5-billion short of projections this year. Finance Minister Travis Toews said his department is still working out the numbers, but acknowledges those estimates are likely not far off.
"I wouldn't go a long ways to dispute that, but there's a lot of uncertainty and we really don't know where this is going to land," Mr. Toews said in an interview.
"We weren't fully recovered from the previous downturn, and so this catches us as a province at a weaker point."
The government has already signalled it doesn't intend to impose significantly steeper spending cuts and will be looking to increase stimulus, such as infrastructure spending in some areas.
In addition, the response to the COVID-19 outbreak will add pressure to health spending, something Mr. Toews said could be absorbed through contingencies already in the budget.
The oil price outlook had already darkened in early March as members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and Russia met to discuss limiting output to guard against global economic weakness brought on by the coronavirus contagion.
The talks broke off with no agreement, however, and Saudi Arabia and Russia have dug in for what looks like a long price war to wrest market share from each other.
Over the past two weeks, the price of U.S. crude has declined by more than 30 per cent, settling on Friday at US$31.92 a barrel.
"When you look at pandemics, that's not new to commodity markets. When you look at price wars, that's certainly not new to commodity markets either. But we've never had both at the same time," said Michael Tran, managing director, Global Energy Strategy for RBC Capital Markets.
"We're dealing with a supply shock and a demand shock, and that's completely uncharted territory for the oil market."
With Russia and Saudi Arabia unlikely to blink any time soon, U.S. crude could average in the mid-US$30s a barrel for 2020, Mr. Tran said.
The Canadian oil sands and heavy oil benchmark, Western Canadian Select, was selling this past week at a discount to WTI of about US$12, putting its value at around US$19 a barrel.
At that level, Alberta's energy industry cannot operate profitably, and scores of companies have slashed capital spending or halted it altogether.
On Monday, Cenovus Energy Inc., the oil sands producer, slashed its capital expenditure program for the year by about $450-million, or 32 per cent. The move came soon after the company's shares lost more than half their value in a single session.
Husky Energy Inc. followed suit on Thursday with $1-billion of spending cuts and plans to shut down unprofitable production.
In Alberta, the oil crash is reverberating through the economy. Calgary's real estate market was setting up for another depressed year before this month's oil price crash.
Commercial real estate company Avison Young had predicted office vacancy at 24 per cent in 2020, up about a percentage point from last year, even with some expectation of an increase in local GDP.
Some towers, such as the former 37-floor former Nexen building on the west side of downtown, are empty.
The biggest hit has been to sub-premium properties outside the downtown core, where vacancies have topped 30 per cent.
That was the market served by Strategic Group, whose 56 Alberta buildings were forced into receivership in late 2019, leaving lenders and other creditors out more than $700-million, making it the largest casualty in the province's property market so far.
Gleaming new towers have only recently been completed in the core, adding to available square footage. Brookfield Place East, Eau Claire Tower and Telus Sky have pulled tenants away from older, lower-quality properties.
Alberta's hotels, also dependent on the energy economy, have bled revenue and guests since the price of oil plunged five years ago. As drilling and production activity in the energy sector contracted, small-town inns were no longer packed with oil workers, with average occupancy in 2016 dropping by 10 per cent from the year before.
The loss of corporate bookings was particularly acute in downtown Calgary, which went from being the best city hotel market in Canada to one of the worst in just half a decade.
Dave Kaiser, president and chief executive of the Alberta Hotels and Lodging Association, said it didn't help that Alberta added the most rooms of any province last year after projects planned during the boom finally opened their doors.
Mr. Kaiser said the fallout from COVID-19 is still unknown, but it will likely compound years of hurt with cancelled business events and general unease around travel.
"Is there light at the end of the tunnel? If there was, it seems like it's probably been shut off here with the events of the last couple of weeks," he said.

Full text: COSTCO PAST FIVE DAYS STAR Panic selling: What's happening on the stock market. Panic buying: What's happening down at your local Costco. Fearing that the coronavirus will render them housebound if they get ill or face quarantine, millions of shoppers emptied Costco's shelves of hand sanitizer, disinfecting wipes, bottled water, canned goods and toilet paper.
Costco's same-store sales soared 12.1 per cent in February, the company said, attributing about onethird of the increase to coronavirus fears. With the lineups only getting longer in March, investors apparently think it's time to load up on Costco's stock.
COST (Nasdaq), US$311.34 up US$30.20 or 10.7% over week S&P 500 PAST FIVE DAYS STAR Everyone knows the stock market is volatile, but this is getting ridiculous. After plunging 11 per cent the previous week - its biggest weekly drop since the financial crisis - the S&P 500 surged 4.6 per cent on Monday, plunged 2.8 per cent on Tuesday, rebounded 4.2 per cent on Wednesday and skidded 3.4 per cent on Thursday. "In the index's history dating back to 1927, we've never had a week of alternating gains and losses of more than 2 per cent from Monday through Thursday," Bespoke Investment Group said. The good news is that, even after Friday's 1.7-percent decline, the S&P 500 eked out a small gain for the week. Are we having fun yet?
S&P 500, 2,972.37 up 18.15 points or 0.6% over week GILEAD SCIENCES PAST FIVE DAYS STAR The novel coronavirus may be bad for the global economy, but it's been good for shareholders of Gilead Sciences. The company's experimental antiviral drug, remdesivir, was originally developed as a treatment for Ebola. But after showing effectiveness against other coronaviruses in lab experiments - as well as in cases in which remdesivir was provided on a "compassionate" basis to severely ill COVID-19 patients - the drug is now in formal clinical trials in China and the United States, with more countries to follow. When the results are known in April, Gilead's stock price will tell you everything you need to know about whether the drug worked or not.
GILD (Nasdaq), US$80.22 up US$10.86 or 15.7% over week SPIN MASTER PAST FIVE DAYS DOG Investors' heads must be spinning after all the bad news from Spin Master. In January, the toy maker warned that gross product sales would fall 1 per cent in 2019, down from a previous estimate of low single-digit percentage growth. In February, it announced the departure of two senior executives. And this week, the company posted a fourthquarter net loss of US$17.2-million and said it expects 2020 gross product sales to fall "toward the higher end of the mid-single-digit range" in part because of "supply chain and other disruptions" from COVID-19. Who knew toys could make people so unhappy?
TOY (TSX), $16.78 down $13.14 or 43.9% over week INTERRENT REIT PAST FIVE DAYS STAR Think apartment rents are outrageous? Apartment real estate investment trusts aren't exactly a bargain, either. Driven by high occupancy levels and a dearth of new supply, residential REIT unit prices have been surging as apartment owners spruce up their units and jack up prices for incoming tenants. Shares of InterRent continued their dizzying climb this week, lifted by strong fourth-quarter results. But with the units now trading at more than a 20-per-cent premium to the REIT's net asset value, investors might want to think twice before signing a lease.
IIP.UN (TSX), $18.67 up $2.08 or 12.5% over week

Toronto seeks to tame ‘Wild West' of short-term rentals

Full text: THE LISTING
The City of Toronto is in the process of designing a regulatory and enforcement regime for short-term-rental (STR) operators. But if the experience of other cities is any guide, the new rules could kick off a high-stakes game of cat-and-mouse with hosts bending the rules to continue their lucrative businesses.
This spring, Toronto will begin registering short-term-rental operators. It will then begin enforcing the rules first passed in 2017.
Those rules were upheld in 2019 by the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal after commercial STR hosts filed an appeal.
"The city will first focus on educating the public about the new regulations. City staff will also work with both short-term-rental operators and companies to ensure compliance," said Carleton Grant, executive director of the municipal licensing and standards division. "The city has the authority to cancel registration rights of short-term rental operators, if a short-term operator does not carry out activities with integrity and honesty, violates any federal, provincial or municipal law or bylaw, or conducts activities in such a way that infringes on the rights or endangers the health and safety of the public."
As recently highlighted in The Globe and Mail, many short-term rental operators may already be violating the city's existing bylaws around rooming houses and the provincial fire code.
The Globe highlighted the case of a listing calling itself "The Mansion" in North York, a single house for which there were 35 individual listings. The operator was known to have played host to more than 20 people at a time in triple-bunk beds packed into almost every room in the mid-century house at 1 Toba Dr.
After the story appeared, local councillor Jaye Robinson's office notified the licensing and standards department and an investigation was opened. On Feb. 21, bylaw investigators issued a notice to comply with zoning and an order to comply with property standards.
A spokesperson from Airbnb said that when a listing is brought to their attention that could affect the safety of the community they may take action against a listing - including suspension or removal.
To date, 1 Toba's host, listed only as "Walter," still has an active account. The "Mansion" listing has been taken down, but his account still shows a second rented house being sublet on Airbnb at 411 Carlton St., although his profile is filled with automated reviews notifying users he has cancelled many coming stays.
Harmari STR, a compliance services company active in many U.S.
states, did a data analysis of Toronto to estimate how widespread the rooming house issue was. The company's Torontobased chief executive officer, Allen Atamer, searched the database the company has built for commercial clients - including 15 condo buildings in Toronto and 47 municipalities in North America - for "listings that include the keyword ‘bunk' in their reviews, plus any [STR] listings that advertise over 12 guests." More than 400 examples with multiple bedrooms and claims of being able to accommodate between 13-18 guests at a single property showed up on such platforms as VRBO, Airbnb and Booking.com.
"It's still the Wild West in this industry," Mr. Atamer said.
Harmari STR got its start nine years ago in an earlier era of digital disruption, when it would analyze sites such as Kijiji and Craigslist for police and motor vehicle regulators seeking information about those using the classifieds platforms as a vector for stolen cars and other forms of insurance fraud. "We are applying that expertise and skill to STRs, to find and identify them. Without knowing where they are [cities] can't police them. That's where the gap is with the platforms and municipalities," he said.
Harmari examines 60 sites that do short-term bookings, although Airbnb is still the market leader estimated to control close to 80 per cent of Toronto's listings.
Some listings Harmari found sublet as many as seven bedrooms per house, well above the city's limit of three per STR site, and some even advertise their likely status as an unlicensed rooming house in the listing name: "Toronto 6 Bedroom entire House," "Lavish townhouse w/ sauna & jacuzzi - Sleep 18," and "81 Fancy Entire House for Up to 20 people".
"[Airbnb's] whole business model hinges on them downloading responsibility to thousands of individual hosts and not being held accountable for what they post on their platform," said Thorben Wieditz, an activist and spokesperson for the Fairbnb coalition that has pushed Canadian cities toward harsher regulations on the industry.
Toronto's bylaw says hosts can rent up to three bedrooms in a unit for an unlimited number of nights a year (up to a maximum of 28 days per stay) or their entire home for a maximum of 180 nights a year. The major roadblock for commercial operators in Toronto's bylaw is a restriction that only a host's principal residence can be used for short-term rentals.
According to Mr. Atamer, there are already more than 30 largescale property management companies operating STRs in Toronto - some with 100 or 200 rooms under management - that could evade this rule today using a web of identities. "One of the classic examples I can give, you see an Airbnb hosted by a very attractive female blonde, in the reviews it's all comments about her ‘friend Yuri' handling the listing. You'll see him 20 times in the reviews, and then in other reviews on other listings. It's all a façade," Mr. Atamer said.
So far, Harmari's Toronto clients have been condo boards that ban short-term rentals, and the service is also attractive to buildings with an integrated hotel component - such as the former Trump Tower, now the St. Regis Hotel, at 325 Bay St. - that property managers are loathe to undermine.
Mr. Atamer said Toronto hosts attempting to evade scrutiny are also beginning to borrow a tactic his company has identified elsewhere: vampire listings.
"Vampire listings pop up at night and go down during the day, they are trying to hide from condo security guards, from bureaucrats and others," he said. In a snippet of research Harmari published last year, about 12.6 per cent of the 4,914 STR listings in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., were intermittent "vampire listings" that hosts remove and repost every day. Sonoma County, Calif., a popular wine region, saw 14 per cent of its 5,156 listings behave the same way.
According to a spokesperson for licensing and standards, Toronto is considering hiring outside contractors to build up its monitoring systems. A contract to build the registration system was awarded to accountancy giant KPMG, but a request-for-proposals for the investigative tools has not been awarded yet.

Full text: One of Vancouver's most successful restaurateurs - an icon who pioneered the concept of a contemporary British Columbian cuisine, groomed countless industry leaders and set a benchmark for fine dining - says he is retiring, a victim of skyrocketing rents and property taxes.
John Bishop will be closing Bishop's in Kitsilano on Aug. 1, after a multiaward-winning and influential 35-year run, because he says he can no longer afford to keep the doors open.
"The economic pressure on small businesses these days - the rising rents, the property taxes, the general cost of operations - well, it tends to keep you awake at night," Mr. Bishop, 75, said in a phone interview on Tuesday.
Until recently, Mr. Bishop had been protected from rising rents by an accommodating landlord who owned the two-storey building at 2183 West 4th Ave., in the bustling thoroughfare of Vancouver's tony Kitsilano neighbourhood.
Mr. Bishop's landlord died four years ago and the estate has since boosted the rent. "Not by a huge amount," Mr. Bishop says. But the property taxes have become untenable. The property was recently appraised at $5-million. Mr. Bishop pays one-third of the taxes and overhead on the building - approximately $19,000 last year, in addition to licensing permits ($2,468) and rent ($60,600).
"I don't want to retire, but I don't want to get to the point where I would have to declare bankruptcy, not after all these years. I thought about putting this in the press release. I didn't want to cry the blues. But that's the real story. I'm closing the restaurant because I'm no longer able to maintain it."
Ian Tostenson, president and chief executive of the BC Restaurant and Food Services Association, says this "shocking" news will be a sobering wake-up call for politicians.
"People think if you're John Bishop, you've got it made. He's the classiest guy in the industry.
And he's there every night - not off in some office - practically parking the cars by himself.
"If this is what it's going to take to get everyone to wake up and realize that Vancouver is no longer a place where people can afford to do business, then it's really sad."
Skyrocketing land values in certain commercial districts - the result of speculative buying or rezoning allowing greater density - have pushed assessments and tax bills up and have hammered small businesses.
Almost all business owners who rent are required to pay the taxes for the building they occupy - what's known as a triple-net lease. The way the property-tax system works now, commercial properties are assessed based on sales of nearby properties with similar characteristics. That means the low-rise building where Mr. Bishop's restaurant is could end up with the same valuation as if a multistorey condo complex with retail along the bottom was built there.
The assessed value of the building has more than doubled in only four years, going from $3.7-million in 2016 to $8.4-million in 2020 for the building, which has a few apartments over the restaurant.
Cities in the Lower Mainland have been asking for relief, but when the province unveiled its solution last week, the mayors said it was so deeply flawed as to be unworkable.
The Welsh-born chef's contribution to the culinary scene has been huge. He opened Bishop's in 1985 after being fired as head chef by the comptroller at Il Giardino, which had been hard hit by the recession.
He wasn't the first Vancouver chef to celebrate local ingredients, but he was the most influential and famous, especially after 10 years on television with Umberto Menghi. At a time when most restaurants were still flying in Dover sole from Europe, he put Pacific sablefish on the menu, and cultivated strong relationships with farms and foragers. By the early aughts, his menu was almost all organic.
"John Bishop has always been known as the grandfather of local eating in Vancouver," says Burdock & Co.'s Andrea Carlson, one of many female chefs he employed at a time when restaurants were still boys' clubs.
One of the last small fine-dining holdouts in Vancouver, Bishop's set a high bar for gracious hospitality in an elegant room, where the tables are still set with white linen and antique silverware. The walls, cleaned with a fresh coat of paint every year, have always been adorned with the works of local artists (many long before they were famous), including Bill Reid, Gordon Smith, Robertson Davies, Toni Onley and Jack Shadbolt.
"John has a subtle way of making every customer feel like they're the most important person in the room," says Vikram Vij of Vij's, one of many in an illustrious list of alumnus that includes James Walt (Araxi) and Adam Busby (now a director at the Culinary Institute of America).
"This restaurant is still such a cute little place," says Mr. Bishop, who had hoped to go out on a higher note, but felt "obligated" to ring the alarm bells for the rest of the industry. "It would be the perfect restaurant for a young chef to take over. But how would they even begin to pay the costs?"

Full text: A major public pension fund and a Crown corporation have teamed up to develop 520 acres northwest of downtown Toronto, in what will be the largest urban development project in the country.
Public Sector Pension Investment Board (PSP Investments) - the pension plan for federal public servants - and federal landowner Canada Lands Co. are in the early stages of figuring out plans for a new business and residential community on neighbouring lands they each own in the Downsview area.
The vast site has been used by the Canadian Forces and by aircraft manufacturers since the 1920s. Its current use by Bombardier Inc., including a 2.25-kilometre runway, has kept much of the land empty and imposed height limits on nearby buildings.
The pension fund recently created a real estate development company called Northcrest Developments to work on the project.
"This is about creating a new centre in the city," said Chris Eby, the executive vicepresident of Northcrest and former chief of staff for Toronto Mayor John Tory. "It has the potential to be a place that has it all."
The plans will require the land to be rezoned because they are meant to be employment lands, a process that could prove controversial. An arbitrator has turned down a rezoning application for the area once already and a city councillor has already objected.
Northcrest and Canada Lands are just the latest to announce ambitious plans to develop offices and residential properties in a city that is growing rapidly and suffering from a housing shortage. In Toronto, rents are soaring and the average selling price of a detached house is well over $1million.
Northcrest, Canada Lands and its architects all said they want to transform the land into a vibrant community for residents, workers and businesses. Their ambitions mirror those of other large urban and suburban landowners, such as SmartCentres Real Estate Investment Trust with its Vaughan Metropolitan Centre project north of downtown Toronto.
At Downsview, PSP owns 370 acres, which now houses a Bombardier aircraft facility due to move by the end of 2023. Canada Lands owns 150 acres of land that is now part of the redevelopment, as well as the federally run Downsview Park, which occupies nearly 300 acres. The parkland is not included in the redevelopment.
The site, which was first used by De Havilland Aircraft of Canada in 1929, contains more than a dozen heritage buildings and is now home to a college campus and a variety of retail and recreational facilities.
Canada Lands started talking to PSP in 2018, after the pension fund bought its land from Bombardier for nearly $1-billion - at the time, the highest-value land deal in Canadian history. The removal of Bombardier's runway is a "big game-changer," said David Anselmi, senior director of real estate for Canada Lands; by removing height restrictions on the area, it allows for taller buildings and denser development.
At 520 acres, the combined site is about the size of Toronto's downtown core. It is adjacent to three municipal subway stations and a GO Transit commuter train station.
However, most of the area is zoned by the City of Toronto as employment lands. The developers aim to remake the site with a mix of residential, commercial and office uses, along with park space.
This could be controversial.
The provincial land arbitrator recently ruled to keep the site as employment lands, which is viewed as important to protecting industrial jobs. But the Downsview site is still subject to another appeal.
"Negotiations [about] other land uses are part of that process," said Toronto chief planner Gregg Lintern. "The process will include consideration of current land use, the potential for new employment, the three subway and one GO stations that serve the area."
While local city councillor James Pasternak has expressed concern about development on the site, Mr. Tory says he is now open to a review of the site.
"We have always expected and anticipated that the redevelopment of this Downsview site will [include] thousands of jobs," said the mayor's spokesman, Don Peat. "It will also, more than likely, include a significant number of residential units, including affordable housing." He cited the precedent of the Christie's Bakery site in Etobicoke, where employment lands are being rezoned for a major mixed-use development by First Capital Realty Inc.
In Downsview, the developers will begin an application process with the City of Toronto this year to change the zoning on their lands. It could take more than 30 years to develop the entire site, they said. Mr. Eby and Mr. Anselmi started preliminary meetings with the city this year. They characterized their meetings as positive.
The developers have hired a design team including Danish architects Henning Larsen, Toronto's KPMB Architects, Danish landscape and architecture firm SLA and Toronto planning firm Urban Strategies Inc. Most of these consultants are also working on another major Toronto redevelopment project, East Harbour. That 39-acre site near downtown was recently bought by the real estate arm of the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan.

Full text: When interior designer Michael Godmer and his architect husband Mathieu Turgeon went looking for a new residence that would also serve as Michael's studio, little did they expect that they would end up buying half a house - literally.
Located in the heart of Montreal's hip Le Plateau-Mont-Royal borough, the three-storey building is an oddity in being only 12 feet wide, half the standard 24foot span of the typical abode in the neighbourhood.
"It piqued our curiosity. There was something ultra-charming about it," Mr. Godmer says.
They also saw the place had potential as the ideal staging ground for a three-tiered space in which one moves seamlessly from the public to the private: the ground floor as studio/meeting room, the main floor as living space/showroom and the top floor as private quarters.
The challenge was to make maximum use of the limited space while also retaining key elements and details of the original house, built in the late 19th century.
A pediment-topped darkgreen door framed by stonework serves as a welcoming entrance to the Maison-Boutique Coloniale, as it is dubbed. Once inside, one is struck by the clean lines of the natural-light-filled collaborative workspace. There is a long desktop along one wall. Shelves mounted along the wall hold sample materials from different projects. Against the opposite wall is a floor-to-ceiling String shelving unit.
Occupying a prominent place is the original winding staircase that leads to the first floor. Beyond it is a newly built passageway giving access to a meeting room at the very back.
The room, which once housed the hot-water heater, has been transformed into a cozy conference area complete with velvet terracotta-coloured curtains, a triple-globe hanging light fixture and exposed brick-and-stone walls. In stark contrast to the front room with its white surfaces and airy feel, the space is meant to have a touch of "speakeasy atmosphere" to it, Mr. Godmer said.
Cleverly integrated along both sides of the passageway, concealed behind white panelled doors with brass knobs are storage and service units as well as a striking minimalist powder room with whitewashed brick and black-and-white terrazzo.
The pine floors, both in the workspace and elsewhere in the house, were kept intact but bleached.
"The pine floors are original.
We bleached them to get more of a Scandinavian look and create a light-reflective, open feel," said Mr. Godmer, 29, whose husband works outside the home studio at an architectural firm. (There are two other members of the family: poodles Jacques and Barbara.)
The first floor boasts a highly functional kitchen that makes the best of limited space. A long marble-topped counter in the centre of the room includes deep pull-out drawers that store the dishes. The terracotta floor is a nod to the original terracotta that was in too poor a condition to salvage.
Custom-made oak cabinets are highlighted by recessed brass pulls. The black-framed sliding doors give onto the postagestamp-size deck. At 11 feet, the high ceiling adds a welcome sense of openness.
Just off the kitchen, a delicate brass light fixture hangs over the 19th-century Shaker dining-room table.
In keeping with the brass motif, a long, thin shelf of brass tops the marble backsplash behind the kitchen's range.
Off the dining area, facing a mid-20th century walnut sideboard, is the original staircase, with its unusual banister that sweeps upwards in dramatic vertical fashion.
In the living room, with its stark white-brick wall and floorto-ceiling curtains, two reproductions of the iconic 1925 Wassily Chair by Bauhaus member Marcel Breuer add a classic modernist touch.
The living room serves to showcase different design concepts and furnishings. Mr. Godmer regularly rotates different pieces through the space. "We want to highlight local artists and artisans," he says.
These days, a work in acidetched and laser-cut steel by Montreal-based artist James Kennedy is featured on one wall.
Clients and would-be clients drop by for prearranged visits and consultations, but Mr. Godmer tries to keep visiting hours within reasonable limits, and is also careful to maintain a firewall between the public and the private spheres.
For the official launch of the space last October, Mr. Godmer stuck cards on the walls next to the various design elements, similar to the explanatory notes adjoining artworks in a gallery, with information on the materials used and the artisans and suppliers involved.
"I used to rent an office but I wanted my own space and not have to be working on the countertop in the kitchen. I also wanted to be able to receive my clients in an actual living space," he said.
He is keen on providing them with an authentic experience, something he feels is superior to visiting an artificial showroom.
The private space on the third floor consists of two bedrooms and a bathroom. The centrepieces of the sparsely furnished master bedroom are a Floyd platform bed and free-standing full-length mirror.
Much of Mr. Godmer's attention these days is focused on clients' primary and secondary residences. One recent project - Résidence Elmwood - involved a major revitalization of a Victorian two-storey home in the Montreal borough of Outremont. In similar fashion to the redo at MaisonBoutique Coloniale, which was completed last year, the mission was to strike a balance between the traditional and the contemporary.
The Maison-Boutique is also intended to be a meeting place for cross-disciplinary ventures involving designers, architects, artisans and suppliers. "I want to break down barriers between the different disciplines and get everyone around the table in a convivial frame of mind," Mr. Godmer said.

Toronto considering tax on empty storefronts

Full text: Toronto will explore the feasibility of a tax on vacant storefronts in an attempt to revitalize commercial streets and discourage speculators from sitting on real estate.
The issue has gained local prominence in a hot real estate market that creates what Councillor Brad Bradford dubbed "a perverse incentive" to keep a store empty and watch its value climb.
"Many of our main streets are dying," said Mr. Bradford, who introduced the motion at city council calling for a report into such a tax. "We see blocks and blocks of retail that's been boarded up, not for six months, not for the duration for a transit project, but for years and years and years, because of rampant speculation."
Such a tax is being considered in Vancouver, where a staff report earlier this month showed the storefront vacancy rate in some neighbourhoods surpassing 10 per cent. In New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio has called for a similar measure, and residents in San Francisco will vote next week on a tax on empty storefronts. Toronto used to offer a rebate for owners of vacant retail and industrial properties, as a way to help their owners cope with missing rental income. That was cancelled in 2018 out of concerns it was providing the wrong incentive.
Toronto city council voted to approve Mr. Bradford's motion on Wednesday, asking staff to report back this year on the vacant storefront tax, with information on how such a tax might work and what impact it might have on the number of empty stores.
But Ed Sonshine, real estate developer and founder of mall owner RioCan REIT, said that a vacant storefront tax would constitute a "double hit" for landlords who lack a tenant and whose properties are not in line for redevelopment. "Not sure why there is an assumption that every vacant store is being kept purposefully vacant," he said in an e-mail. "Sometimes it just takes a while to find a tenant."
Montreal academic Jacques Nantel, who studies retail commerce, said such a tax could be punitive if applied to owners in a struggling local business environment or those hurt by the rise of online shopping. But he said it might have the desired policy impact on landlords who are speculating. "So, depending who's owning the real estate, it will have a different effect, but over all it won't have a huge effect," said Mr. Nantel, a professor emeritus at HEC Montréal. "When you add up everything, it probably won't change a whole lot on the dynamic of the market. It certainly will not change the equilibrium of the city."
Toronto city staff, who are working separately on a strategy to help main shopping streets, said Wednesday they do not track either the number or duration of storefront vacancies.
Mr. Bradford also didn't have numbers, but said vacant stores are a concern commonly voiced by residents. He said the point of the tax was not to raise money but to encourage behaviour. And he argued it should be no disincentive to developers trying to assemble land.
"It doesn't preclude any sort of development potential, but what it does is make sure that our main streets are vibrant and animated in the interim," he said. "What we don't want is main streets that are vacant and we want to make sure that we are encouraging, from a policy perspective, landlords to look at options to support local business."
A handful of city councillors were opposed to adding the motion to the agenda of Wednesday's council meeting and then voted against asking for a report. Several of them raised concerns about the difficulty in determining whether a property was truly vacant, and how staff could differentiate between speculators and landlords hurt by neighbourhood conditions.
Councillors Josh Matlow and Mike Colle both pointed to struggling property owners along Eglinton Avenue, where retailers in their wards have been hurt by years of construction for the Crosstown light rail line.
"I think it is a very inappropriate motion ... because it almost sends a message that the people who now have lost their business, or may lose their business, are now going to be hit by an extra tax," Mr. Colle said.
"At this very sensitive time, and we're dealing with 140 stores that have closed [along] Eglinton, I cannot even entertain looking at a vacant store tax."

Full text: The pension plan for federal public servants is getting into real estate development, hiring an executive from an established Canadian builder and creating a separate company to develop a sizable swath of land northwest of downtown Toronto.
Public Sector Pension Investment Board (PSP Investments) has set up a new company called Northcrest Developments to develop its 371 acres in Toronto's Downsview area.
The land is mostly vacant, except for Bombardier's aircraft assembly site, which is due to move in 2023.
The land, which is accessible by Toronto's subway system, is seen as prime real estate in a city grappling with a shortage of housing and office space.
"This is one of the biggest city building opportunities in a generation," said Chris Eby, Northcrest's executive vice-president and a former chief of staff to Toronto Mayor John Tory.
Northcrest recently hired Derek Goring, a top developer from First Gulf Corp., who helped lead development of 38 acres of unused land east of Toronto's financial district, which has since been purchased by Cadillac Fairview for $690-million. Mr. Goring has been named executive vicepresident of development.
Mr. Eby said his team of five will spend the rest of this year talking to area residents, community groups, local politicians and businesses to come up with a new land use and development plan for the Downsview land.
"You have to get the right plan in place and you have to get buy-in for the plan," Mr. Eby said.
Bombardier said in December it will vacate the property by the end of 2023, part of the deal brokered when PSP Investments bought the Downsview property from the aircraft maker for $825-million in 2018. Bombardier is moving its operations to a new facility at Toronto Pearson International Airport.
Mr. Eby said there is an opportunity to deliver investment returns to PSP Investments and support public policy goals of increasing housing supply.
However, the land is currently zoned for employment, not residential use.
"There is unquestionably an opportunity to revisit the land use," Mr. Eby said. However, he said it was "too early in the process to lay out specific numbers" on residential, office and retail properties.
Mr. Tory has previously said that preserving employment lands was a priority and that his office's policy, in the case of the Downsview property, would be to keep the current zoning.
Employment lands are taxed at a much higher rate, and they need fewer services than residential zones.
On Monday, however, Don Peat, a spokesman for the mayor, said large sites such as Downsview will "more than likely include a significant number of residential units, including affordable housing. The site has new transit infrastructure and the mayor supports transit-oriented development."
He said city staff are working with PSP Investments to determine the "right mix" of employment and housing for the site.
PSP Investments, which is also the investment arm of the pension plan for the Canadian Forces and the RCMP, is the fourth-largest pension fund in the country with $168-billion of net assets under management as of its annual report released last March.
PSP is the latest Canadian pension fund to launch a separate real estate company. British Columbia Investment Management Corp. created QuadReal in 2016. Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System invests and develops real estate through Oxford Properties and the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan's real estate company is Cadillac Fairview.
However, unlike the other pension funds' real estate companies, Northcrest's only mandate right now is to develop the Downsview property. It will not run PSP Investment's $24-billion real estate portfolio, which includes investments in apartments in Canada and office buildings in Australia.

Full text: After Tao Yi was laid off from his job in Calgary's energy sector in December, 2016, the instrumentation control engineer spent more than two years looking for work. With no sign of an end to the oil industry's slump, Mr. Yi decided to change his approach.
"I can still learn new stuff, so why not transfer to another career?" the 45-year-old said. When a friend told him about a new tech-training program at Bow Valley College, Mr. Yi went online to learn more. Thinking it was a good fit, he applied.
"It's hard to go back to the oil and gas industry, so I decided to find a new path," said Mr. Yi, one of 50 people accepted to the first year of Bow Valley College's Tech Skills to Employment initiative in 2019. The free program for unemployed and underemployed Albertans offers four months of classroom training in data science and a 10-week work placement.
He finished the course last summer and is now working for the Tech Skills initiative as a casual education assistant, while he continues to look for a full-time data analyst job. He remains positive about his prospects, given he has applied to about 60 IT jobs in under six months. "At least you can send your résumé out. For engineering, you had almost no chance to send it out," Mr. Yi said.
Many of Mr. Yi's fellow classmates are benefiting from the program, said David Harvey, dean of Bow Valley College's School of Continuing Learning. Evaluations completed 90 days after its end show about 65 per cent of all learners are employed, with about 50 per cent of all learners are working in tech-related fields.
"We think that's a pretty good number, but we're striving to get that number higher," he said. Earlier this month, the Alberta Ministry of Labour and Immigration gave the program a two-year extension. With $1.4-million of funding from the provincial and federal governments, spots will open for 100 more learners to transition to tech.
While numerous training initiatives are under way in Calgary to match people who lost oil and gas jobs with openings in technology, challenges remain for both workers and companies.
Leaders from postsecondary institutions, the city's economic development agency and industry are working together to address gaps, with diversifying the economy top of mind for all.
Calgary's tech sector is not nascent, but it's now attracting more attention amid a downturn that began when oil prices crashed in October, 2014, leading the energy sector to lose tens of thousands of jobs. "What makes this experience different [from previous downturns] is that there was not a rebound, basically of any kind, in oil and gas following the drop in oil prices," said Trevor Tombe, associate professor of economics at the University of Calgary. That prolonged and persistent drop in energy sector activity has led to big pockets of people still out of work, Prof. Tombe said. Calgary had an unemployment rate of 7.2 per cent in January.
Meanwhile, uncertainty remains over how Alberta's United Conservative government views the tech sector. Last fall, Premier Jason Kenney's first budget saw the cancellation of business tax credit programs many in technology saw as beneficial.
The tech sector is the city's path forward, said Mary Moran, president and chief executive at Calgary Economic Development.
"We know that this is the only way that we're going to create companies here, fill office space and provide jobs for the future, because the energy industry just isn't going to be the mega job creator it once was," she said.
Her organization's latest initiative is the EDGE UP: Energy to Digital Growth Education and Upskilling Project, funded by the Future Skills Centre, a national organization helping prepare people for employment success.
Ms. Moran said close to 400 people applied for 75 spots in the pilot program, which starts this month.
The program is for mid-career oil and gas workers, such as engineers and geoscientists. They receive training in one of three areas: information technology project manager, data analytics or full-stack/software development.
In addition to technical training at local postsecondary institutions and work-placement assistance, Ms. Moran said students also get comprehensive "cultural training."
"We want to make sure that there's assimilation into the big cultural change between an energy company and potentially a tech company," Ms. Moran said.
People accustomed to their own office, Fridays off, a gym membership and a parking spot will face differences at tech companies, she said, including in compensation, hours and office environment.
Making that cultural change is only possible if you're able to land a job, though, and while career strategist Jackie Rafter is seeing a lot of short-term support for professionals transitioning to tech, she's not seeing a lot of people actually getting hired. "The majority of tech jobs that are available are for true techies. So these are people with computer science degrees and extensive technical training, not a six-week or six-month boot camp," said Ms. Rafter, who, five years ago, founded Higher Landing, which offers job transition services to laid off oil and gas workers.
Cristian Tibrea, a client of Higher Landing, has experienced that struggle. Mr. Tibrea was an electronics technician with a decade of experience when he moved to Calgary from Romania in 2001. He went on to become an engineer, working in the oil and gas sector until a layoff in 2015.
In 2019, Mr. Tibrea took a new four-month program to transition to IT, aiming to become a network specialist. While Mr. Tibrea felt the technical training he received was good, he was disappointed the program didn't include work experience or industry-recognized certification. He later completed a Cisco CCNA certification, but said with no recent IT work experience on his résumé, finding a job has remained challenging. He's now considering leaving Calgary, possibly returning to Romania. "It's the only chance to do something, because here, now, there's nothing," he said. Ms. Rafter said oil and gas workers can also face barriers because some employers may have a certain impression of them, including assumptions that the workers won't stay in a new industry, are entitled, want too much money or aren't prepared to start at the bottom.
HR manager Anette Ceraficki points to another reason why the move to tech may not be so easy: not everyone wants it. "The big dream when we first started talking about these retraining programs three or four years ago was that we would take all those unemployed petroleum engineers and transform them magically into software developers," said Ms. Ceraficki, who has worked in human resources in Calgary's tech sector since the mid 1990s, currently with Getty Images. "But the reality has been not all petroleum engineers want to be software developers."
And not everyone needs to be a developer, Amin Lalani said. At Avanti Software, which he acquired in 2016, the co-CEO has hired people with oil and gas experience for client-facing roles, as opposed to highly technical ones.
He believes some skills are easily transferable between the fields, without the need for extensive retraining. "It's not all about reskilling and upskilling to become a developer," he said. Ms. Ceraficki added that "tech-adjacent" jobs in Calgary are being filled, such as in digital marketing or client support. But, "when it comes to software developers, data scientists, search engineers, cloud engineers, those kinds of roles, we have a shortage, and that is one of our biggest limiting factors to tech really exploding," she said.
Staffing challenges are not new to Calgary's tech industry, which has long had to compete financially with what oil and gas companies could offer employees. The playing field has changed and while all transitions may not be seamless, they can happen. Monika Wasylkiewicz recently made the switch, leaving an engineering job in oil and gas in 2018 to start a one-year master's degree in software engineering at the University of Calgary.
Ms. Wasylkiewicz is now an application development engineer at a Calgary software company that automates oil and gas control room operations, called Crux OCM. "I love it," she said. "It's an ideal fit for my skill set and my knowledge, because I can now apply all those learnings from the software degree, as well as everything I learned in oil and gas, into creating something that can help the industry."

Full text: SIX FLAGS PAST FIVE DAYS
DOG Think riding a roller coaster is scary? It's nothing compared to the scream-inducing ride that theme park operator Six Flags Entertainment gave investors this week. The shares suffered a highspeed vertical drop after the company swung to a fourth-quarter loss and slashed its dividend by 70 per cent, citing soft attendance at its domestic theme parks. With Six Flags also terminating a development agreement in China after its partner there defaulted on payments to the company, investors have had enough of this ride.
NORTHVIEW PAST FIVE DAYS
DOG Groupon's deals may save people money, but the stock just cost investors a pile of cash. With business stalling amid fierce competition, the online coupon company posted a 23-per-cent drop in fourth-quarter revenue, causing earnings to miss expectations and sending the stock to a steep loss. Groupon now plans to exit the physical goods business and focus on "local experiences" - which include dining, attractions and health and beauty services - in a bid to return to long-term growth. Judging by the stock's decline, however, investors aren't buying it.
GROUPON PAST FIVE DAYS
STAR Hard: Trying to find a reasonably priced apartment. Easy: Making money on apartment real estate investment trusts. With rents shooting higher amid stratospheric housing prices and tight rental supply, apartment REITs have been surging as investors flock to the sector. Northview Apartment REIT's units soared after private real estate companies Starlight Investments and KingSett Capital announced plans to buy Northview for $4.8-billion or $26.25 a unit - a 12-per-cent premium to the price before the deal was announced. That'll pay a few months' rent.
BLUE APRON PAST FIVE DAYS
DOG Blue Apron investors are blue, all right. Shares of the mealkit delivery company - already down about 97 per cent from their 2017 initial public offering price - got clobbered after Blue Apron reported a fourth-quarter loss of US$21.9-million or US$1.66 a share as net revenue skidded 33 per cent. In light of the dreadful results, the company plans to close a production facility in Arlington, Tex., and is "evaluating a broad range of strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value," including a possible sale or a capital raise. But given the company's trajectory, it's hard to imagine anyone banging on Blue Apron's door.
FLUOR PAST FIVE DAYS
DOG Fluor investors just got floored. Citing a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into the company's past accounting and financial reporting, the engineering and construction giant said it will delay filing its full-year financial statements until the end of February at the earliest. Fluor said it "has not made a determination at this time as to whether there are prior period material errors in its financial statements," but plenty of investors have made a determination they won't wait around to see how this ends.

Rooming houses run rampant as rules go unenforced

Full text: The house listed on Airbnb at 1 Toba Dr. in North York looks like a typical product of 1960s upper-middle class suburban living - a brick and siding structure with a steep driveway on a corner lot next to a ravine park. Inside is a very different scene: Room after room is filled with racks of bunk beds. What was a living room now has 13 beds (four racks of triple bunks and one extra cot) and a full-sized refrigerator.
The man who opened the door on a recent afternoon - he called himself Jimmy - says 20 people are currently living in the fivebedroom family home. The house actually has 35 separate "rooms" listed for rent on Airbnb (some of which are actually just one of the bunks) for bargain prices as low as $10 a night.
"I received a bunk bed and had to share the room with three other people," user Arul Prakash wrote in a recent review of his stay in what is grandly called The Mansion.
"A guy was making phone calls in the night and another guy was watching movies with loudspeaker on at 4 a.m. and I couldn't really sleep. They don't provide toilet papers in the lavatory and the guests had to bring their own.
This is fine for people who are staying for long, but can you expect tourists to carry around toilet papers?" Aside from the discomfort of guests such as Mr. Prakash, the house on Toba Drive, a cross between a hostel and a rooming house, represents the extreme edge of the Airbnb model. It is an example of the multiple ways an operator can exist on the sprawling hospitality platform while flouting municipal rules and safety regulations.
According to the city's bylaw enforcement portal, there are no current investigations into 1 Toba Dr. Several neighbours The Globe and Mail spoke to had no idea that the house had been operating as a short-stay hotel since 2019.
The Airbnb listing is registered to a man named "Walter," but the house does not appear to be owned by him.
Property records for 1 Toba Dr.
show it was purchased for $4.7million in 2016 by Yuming Chen and Fang Dong, and it was listed for lease on Toronto's local MLS site in 2019. Another house listed by Walter on Airbnb, 411 Carlton St., is registered to Kenneth Green, and also appears to be leased.
Walter declined to answer some of The Globe's questions, but did say he has been an Airbnb operator for four years and claimed to have multiple houses under multiple identities on the platform.
Walter is far from the only operator on Airbnb in Toronto who could run afoul of the city's new rules that limit the number of bedrooms in a rental to three, and cap a whole-home rental to 180 nights a year. According to McGill researcher David Wachsmuth, as of April, 2019, there were more than 21,000 short-term rentals in Toronto listed on such platforms as Airbnb, VRBO and HomeAway.
According to data activists at InsideAirbnb.com, there are 136 host identities in Toronto alone with eight or more room or house listings to their name. Across Canada, Airbnb has close to 150,000 listings.
A cursory search of the platform finds multiple examples of a listing that would be a de facto rooming house (in Toronto, any house, apartment or building where four or more people pay individual rent and share a kitchen or washroom could be defined as a rooming house). The economic logic for packing in renters is clear: At its current occupancy, 1 Toba Dr. could be pulling in as much as $6,500 a month, maybe as much as $10,000 if every bunk was full. Parts of the house have also been advertised on other platforms for longer-term stays, for as low as $380 a month.
Toronto only allows rooming houses in the districts of Etobicoke, York and the old city of Toronto. Scarborough and East York also ban rooming houses. It's easy to find examples of listings in those areas that would flout rooming house rules, which to Airbnb means those operators may not be in compliance with the platform.
"When hosts sign up on Airbnb, they must certify that they will comply with local rules before they list their space," Alexandra Dagg, director of public policy at Airbnb, said in a statement.
"We also have a hosting responsibilities page that reminds people to check their local laws and regulations and includes additional information and resources."
Airbnb has in recent months taken steps to address safety risks that arise from younger users holding parties that have turned violent in several instances, including a Jan. 31 shooting in a downtown Toronto condo that left three dead. But safety risks for rooming houses have not received special attention.
"There are no regulations about the number of beds that people can put in the room they are renting short-term. However, people can not short-term rent each bed as a ‘room.' The city's enforcement initiatives will be implemented for rooming houses attempting to operate as shortterm rentals," said Carleton Grant, executive director, Municipal Licensing and Standards division for the city of Toronto.
Fire is one of the chief risks associated with illegal rooming houses. Between 2014 and 2018, about 40 fire loss incidents a year were recorded at rooming-house/ boarding-house establishments in the province, according to Ontario's Office of the Fire Marshal.
Seven people died in rooming house fires in that time, and more than $10-million in damages were recorded. In those incidents, open flames or smoker's articles were the primary cause of the fires (28 per cent of the time), while another 25 per cent of the time the cause was undetermined. The fires started in living areas or kitchens 66 per cent of the time.
The interior rooms of the Toba listing smelled of marijuana smoke, and while purchase and consumption has been legalized, smoking marijuana indoors remains a flashpoint for rental providers, not least because of safety.
Rooming houses are required to have two exits to an exterior door for second floors or basements, and Toba's second floor had only a single interior staircase to exit. Having CO2 detectors is a legal requirement in Ontario for rental operators, but the Toba Drive listing states it has none.
Ms. Dagg said Airbnb's rules on disclosure of CO2 detectors were updated in 2018, and the company "recommends the purchase of a portable detector for use during travel, given they are not common in many parts of the world."
Despite safety concerns and being illegal in much of the city, rooming houses are some of the most affordable housing stock available to Toronto tenants. The small number of licensed rooming houses is believed to be vastly outnumbered by illegal operators, but city hall remains split on how to bring them out of the shadows.
"For the past 10 years, every year the city of Toronto discusses rooming houses and how to deal with them. A lot of these illegal rooming houses are filling that affordability vacuum," said Bahar Shadpour, with the Advocacy Centre for Tenants Ontario. "The victims of that are people that are forced to live in that shadow market. They might not call 311 to deal with any issues that might be a detriment to your health [mould or fire safety] because if they do, and the city comes and shuts down the rooming house and those people become homeless."

Full text: At this time last year, many real estate agents were watching the arrival of the U.S.-based Zillow Group into the Canadian marketplace with a mix of curiosity and trepidation.
For lots of people, searching real estate listings is as all-consuming as following Raptors basketball or scrolling Instagram.
And Zillow is a giant online data portal that feeds that obsession.
Consider the keen-eyed searchers looking at a four-bedroom detached in Lansing, Mich., who spotted the killer from the Scream slasher films lurking in some of the interior shots. It was actually the listing agent hiding in a bedroom closet with a butcher knife, but the stunt worked: 209 N. Chestnut St. rocketed to the top of Zillow's most viewed properties.
Last year, a red-brick Georgian in suburban Maple Glen, Penn., blew up on Redfin.com when online house hunters spotted a sex dungeon in the basement. People are paying close attention to those wide-angle photos.
Some Canadian brokerages embraced Zillow's arrival as an opportunity; others were spurred on to create more userfriendly websites for their own brand. The industry juggernaut realtor.ca undertook its own transformation as it prepared to face new competition.
Rick and Rochelle DeClute of Toronto-based Union Realty Brokerage Inc. are two agents who saw potential in Zillow early on.
Because the portal is a marketing company that doesn't employ any agents, they don't view the platform as competition so much as another tool they can use to draw eyeballs to their listings.
Zillow also offers the property's listing history and details about nearby schools. There are decorating blogs and walk scores. In the United States, sellers can tap into the platform's use of artificial intelligence software to produce a "Zestimate" of a property's market value.
"The power behind it is phenomenal," says Mr. DeClute, who is a self-confessed real estate junkie, searching listings all the time, all over the place.
The DeClutes began supplying listings to Zillow last spring.
Their listings also appear on the Canadian Real Estate Association's realtor.ca site, which displays properties from the Multiple Listing Service of real estate boards all across the country.
"It's not a platform people interact with well and look forward to using," Mr. DeClute says of MLS. "It's more of a sales tool than an information tool."
The DeClutes say the database is designed to funnel users to the listing agent.
"That benefits realtors really well, and I don't know that that benefits the consumer really well," Ms. DeClute says.
She says she believes some Canadian agents are reluctant to embrace evolving technology and new industry players because they are uncomfortable with handing power to the consumer with a lot of information - including previous sale prices - that used to be provided only by real estate agents.
But she says she believes agents can add value in many ways. When she bought a property in Florida, for example, she hired a local agent to represent her at the table. Even though she has years of experience in buying and selling real estate, she knew the Florida agent would know the ins and outs of local transactions.
She says she believes agents need to provide invaluable insight to buyers and sellers who can already find a trove of information online.
"It makes us up our game."
Some Canadian agents are unsettled by Zillow's practice in the United States of allowing real estate agents to pay a fee in return for the contact information of consumers who submit a query on the site.
So if a house hunter submits an online form asking for more information about a two-bedroom condo in Seattle, for example, the person who gets back to them may not be the listing agent, but a competing agent who paid for that lead.
"Agents who are afraid of the platform say, ‘they'll take our leads and sell them back to us' - which they may do," Mr. DeClute says. "I think there's a fear that it will diminish the control over the transaction a realtor will have," he says.
"Speaking to colleagues in the United States, some of them are resentful of the investment they're making every month," Ms. DeClute adds.
The bottom line for the DeClutes is that they know from talking to their clients that sellers would prefer to have their properties receive international exposure on Zillow. The client's priority is the sale of their own home - not the business expenses of the listing agent, Mr. DeClute says.
From Vancouver, Zillow's chief industry development officer Errol Samuelson declares the company's foray into Canada a success so far.
After one year, property views on the Zillow site had increased 400 per cent and the number of inquiries to agents jumped 300 per cent, Mr. Samuelson says.
He adds that 80 per cent of respondents to an online survey of Canadians used a website or mobile app in their purchasing journey, according to research conducted by Ipsos on behalf of Zillow.
"Canadians have clearly shifted to looking online," Mr. Samuelson says. "Our phones are becoming this lens through which we interact with or view the world."
He adds that after going live with listings of resale properties in Canada, the platform added listings for rental properties and new construction. That way users can peruse a developer's plans and lots for a subdivision before it's built.
The goal is to let consumers see all of their housing options on one site, he says.
Mr. Samuelson says agents in Canada who supply listings to Zillow can currently add their own profiles free of charge. Zillow also plans to launch a service in Canada that allows agents who specialize in representing buyers to advertise to users, but he doesn't have a date for the rollout.
"A lot of times it's good practice to have a buyer's agent who specifically represents you instead of dealing with the listing agent."
Another line of business currently up-and-running in 21 markets in the U.S. is Zillow Offers.
Sellers with a property on the platform can submit information about the home's size and condition and so forth "Typically, within 24 to 48 hours, we'll come back to you with an offer," Mr. Samuelson explains.
If the homeowner finds the offer acceptable, Zillow sends out an evaluator to check that the property measures up to the homeowner's description. Then Zillow makes a final offer, minus a service fee.
The service appeals to sellers who don't want to worry about cleaning the place up for showings or finding somewhere to take the dog, Mr. Samuelson says.
The seller can choose a closing date anywhere between five and 90 days.
"It seems to tap into this consumer desire for ease," Mr. Samuelson says, explaining that the service fee of 7.5 per cent is higher than the fees an agent charges but some people prefer to opt for certainty and low hassle.
"It's a fascinating business in the U.S. right now," he says.
Mr. Samuelson says it's too soon to say if Zillow will import that business to Canada but no plans are in the works.
"It's early days - even in the United States."
In Ottawa, the Canadian Real Estate Association says the competition heating up the industry is good - the pace of change at its realtor.ca site is quickening as a result.
Realtor.ca, which contains listings from real estate boards across the country, has vast amounts of information plus high recognition with consumers, CREA president Jason Stephen says.
"No question the private sector has a lot more money to throw at those portals, but what they don't have is the data," he says.
Mr. Stephen says a house hunter submitting a form for information on a property will always hear back from the listing agent.
"The consumers want the most knowledgeable person on that property."
CREA's members stress that what they're looking for from the site is the ability to generate more and more leads, he says.
Mr. Stephen, who represents Royal LePage Atlantic in Saint John, makes note of the huge shift in recent years as house hunters use technology to search for information that was previously only available from an agent.
Prospective buyers can search themselves for the previous selling price of a property since the courts in Canada cleared the way for the sharing of those data.
They also use Google Street View to check out the neighbouring houses and anything else they can find.
"Buyers scrutinize what they're looking at more and more and more," he says. "It's the biggest purchase they're going to make so they do a lot of research."
But agents have a chance to provide guidance that isn't available online, he says. They have local knowledge and experience in negotiating, among other skills.
A consumer searching online might see one of Mr. Stephen's listings and send a query on realtor.ca to ask about the heating costs, for example. If the searcher isn't already working with an agent, he has the opportunity to turn that lead into a client.
He adds that he is hearing from residents of British Columbia and Ontario these days who are considering a move to New Brunswick, where real estate is more affordable. Many of them are launching their search from their home province.
One of Mr. Stephen's neighbours is a recent transplant from Toronto who compiled a shortlist of places in Saint John and Moncton just by looking online.
"That person did all that research before they even had a plane ticket to come down."
At Royal LePage, president Phil Soper and chief operating officer Carolyn Cheng both have backgrounds in information technology. As a result, the nationwide company has a tech bent, Mr. Soper says.
"We pour a ton of effort and resources into it."
Mr. Soper says Royal LePage has taken advantage of the gradual liberalization of rules that has allowed competing brokerages to co-operate in sharing listings. The company has beefed up its own website to make it more appealing to searchers.
Ms. Cheng says the firm looks outside of the real estate industry to what the tech giants are doing. This year, Royal LePage will be serving up listings to searchers in the same way that Netflix suggests your next binge watch based on your viewing history and Amazon makes reading recommendations based on books you and people with similar tastes have bought.
So a house hunter might see a pop-up saying "people who looked at this house also looked at this one over here."
Royal LePage already caters to consumers who want an online assessment of the value of their home, Mr. Soper says, because of the data available through other divisions under the Brookfield umbrella. Royal LePage is owned by Brookfield Asset Management.
While many industry players fought against change for years, he says, he pushes for transparency and the sharing of information.
"If you share, consumers will reward that trust."

Full text: A remote parcel of land in northern Mozambique is being touted as the world's most valuable real estate, attracting US$55-billion in planned investment by multinational companies in an emerging gas boom of extraordinary proportions.
The site is the Afungi peninsula, on the Indian Ocean coast near the Tanzania border. Companies such as Exxon Mobil Corp. and Total SA are pouring billions of dollars into offshore gas projects around the peninsula. A city of 150,000 is being planned on a site where just a few thousand now live.
The boom will transform the economy of one of Africa's poorest countries. Standard Bank, a South African bank and major financier in the Afungi projects, says the projects could turn Mozambique into the world's fourth- or fifth-biggest producer of liquid natural gas, giving it an annual growth rate of 10 per cent and turning it into a middle-income country.
The International Monetary Fund says the projects "could lift millions of people out of poverty."
But the projects face some fearsome challenges: a raging Islamist insurgency in northern Mozambique; the threat of pirate attacks on supply ships in the nearby Mozambique Channel; angry protests by communities complaining of jobs going to outsiders; and an economy plagued by gross inequality and state corruption, which could funnel the benefits to a small elite.
Exxon Mobil and Total this month reportedly asked the government to send military reinforcements to guard their operations in Cabo Delgado, the northern province where a shadowy insurgency has killed more than 500 people and forced 100,000 to flee their homes over the past two years.
There are already several hundred troops in the region, along with 200 mercenaries from a Russian private firm, but they have failed to quell the attacks, prompting the investors to seek hundreds of additional troops, the reports said.
The insurgency has been linked to Islamist extremists, but analysts say the rebels are exploiting the grievances of impoverished local communities, which fear that the benefits from the gas boom are being monopolized by outsiders. A report by the Africa-based Institute for Security Studies warns that "social exclusion" is a key factor in the insurgency. Gas project convoys have sometimes been directly targeted by the insurgents.
"The money isn't benefiting the local people," Estacio Valoi, co-author of the ISS report, told The Globe and Mail. "Many of the workers are being recruited from outside."
To make room for an LNG plant, hundreds of people in the Afungi peninsula are being resettled. "Fishermen are losing access to the coast and they're being told to become farmers," Mr. Valoi said. "They're worried about it."
Somali pirates are another potential threat. Although they haven't attacked any ships in the Mozambique Channel since 2011, there are fears they could be lured back by the flow of supply ships for the LNG projects. A maritime surveillance plane, operated by Canadian company PAL Aerospace, was recently spotted at Pemba Airport, near the Mozambique Channel, reportedly on a U.S. anti-piracy contract.
Mozambique could begin exporting gas as early as 2022. Standard Bank estimates the LNG projects will trigger as much as US$128-billion in capital investment across Mozambique, driven by rising LNG demand as China switches to gas from coal. An estimated 40,000 construction jobs will be created on the Afungi peninsula alone.
The government's strategy is to generate enough income from the projects to benefit low-income people in the region and across the country. But this will take careful planning.
"Revenues from gas and oil should go mainly to the agricultural sector," said Higino Francisco de Marrule, Mozambique's Minister of Agriculture and Food Security.
"As a government, we don't want to lose our focus on development and creating better conditions for the people. We can't eat oil and gas."
The gas revenue will allow the government to devote at least 10 per cent of its budget to agriculture, almost double the current percentage, he said, and the project supply chains could spread the benefits to farmers and other local suppliers. "Anything you do in agriculture has a very high multiplier effect," the minister told The Globe in an interview.
The French multinational energy company Total says its gas project will award up to US$2.5billion in contracts to Mozambican companies. It is already holding meetings with the business community to discuss opportunities in engineering, road construction, camp management and security services.
The government is also considering the creation of a sovereign wealth fund to manage the gas revenue. It has signed an agreement to receive expert advice from Norway, an oil and gas exporter that has one of the world's biggest sovereign wealth funds.
But in a country plagued by corruption, where studies have estimated that several billion dollars have been stolen or diverted from state coffers in the past two decades, many people are skeptical that the benefits of the gas projects will trickle down to the poor.
"I don't believe these projects will benefit Mozambicans," said Edson Cortez, an anti-corruption campaigner who heads the Centre for Public Integrity in the capital of Maputo. "We don't have any authority that has the expertise to control the revenue."
Ivan Amade, a banker and business consultant in Maputo, said the country doesn't have enough small and medium-sized enterprises to take advantage of the supply chain opportunities.
Without those companies, the benefits are likely to flow into the pockets of foreigners, he said.
"The gas projects will have an impact mainly on the rich."

Tree tussle: Battle to save an urban forest in Port Hope

Full text: A three-hectare urban forest on a historic estate in Port Hope, Ont., shelters bats, yellow-bellied sapsuckers and butternut trees, a protected species. Biologists and tree experts hired by a real estate developer - as a step in an application for rezoning - label this old-growth forest "significant," noting white pine trees the height of a 15-storey building. White pines of that size, common when Europeans arrived, are rare today.
Even so, the developer has sought permission from the municipality to cut more than 900 trees, and save about 33 trees "if possible," to make way for houses. The plan to clear-cut pits Mason Homes against a vocal group of Port Hope residents, who vow to pack council chambers on Feb. 18 in their bid to save the forest.
The tree tussle has galvanized some comparatively recent arrivals to this quiet port town on Lake Ontario, pop. 17,000, who fled the rapid transformation of greater Toronto. The locals cherish Port Hope's tranquility, perhaps typified by the clock at the town hall.
Dating from 1855, it needs no electricity - a man climbs wooden stairs in the dark twice a week to wind it. The clock chimes on the hour; anglers hear the bells as they fish for steelhead trout at the mouth of the Ganaraska River.
But with Port Hope just an hour's train ride from Toronto's Union Station (and talk of GO Train service to supplement the current VIA trains), development pressure is growing. Already, Mason Homes, based in Stouffville, Ont., has completed Phases 1 through 3 of a large new community of single-family homes here.
A group of concerned citizens gathered on a recent weekday morning at Basil's Market and Deli, a cozy spot known for its potato salad. They joked about who owns the older house. Greg Burns moved from Cambridge to a millhouse here that dates from 1833.
Sue Stickley, here since 1971, has a newer house - from 1854.
"I retired, I got tired of the rat race on Bay Street and the unaffordability of our own house," said Mike Goldstein, a landscape architect who lived in Toronto for 27 years. He chairs Port Hope's tree advisory committee and capped the committee's sevenpage paean to save the woodlot with a warning that "continuing to allow developments like this with no environmental integrity ... will turn Port Hope into another Ajax or Scarborough" - suburbs in Toronto's east that have sprawled exponentially in the postwar period and now are home to hundreds of thousands of people in car-dependent communities.
Development is already well under way. West of the threatened woodlot, a graded expanse of clay spreads to the horizon, devoid of a single tree. This is Mason Homes' Phase 4, for 166 residences. Stacks of pipe and lumber abut piles of deracinated tree roots and jumbled heaps of freshcut pine logs covered in snow.
The ring of hammers punctuates the roar of forklift and cement trucks. On a recent weekday, a visitor surprised a pair of foxes. They bounded into the forest.
Phase 5 would replace the woods with 326 houses and 43 townhouse units. The name of this development, Penryn Mason Homes, appears to trade on the cachet of this spot, Penryn Estate, built by a commander who fought in the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. The late commander's 1828 home is listed in Canada's Register of Historic Places.
Treescape Certified Arborists surveyed the forest over the past two years for Mason Homes. They said almost half the trees are Norway maples, an introduced species. Still, native oak, sugar maple, cherry and walnut trees abound. Treescape counted four butternut trees; provincial rules forbid removal of healthy native butternut trees.
Biologists with Niblett Environmental Associates Inc., hired by Mason Homes, spent four hours last summer at the forest.
"Although this woodland was considered ‘significant' based on its size, the quality of the woodland on the property was degrading," the biologists wrote. "The removal of the woodlot ... would not pose a significant impact to the overall diversity of the area."
They recommend installation of 20 bat boxes nearby to mitigate the forest's disappearance, and posit that wildlife can relocate to forest patches and a golf course to the south. Locals decry the brevity of the biologists' visit and argue that, as a home for birds and animals, a golf course is no substitute for a forest.
The Ganaraska Region Conservation Authority also disagrees with the developer's biologists.
These woods lie in Ecoregion 6E, known as "mixedwood plains," that stretches from Quebec City to Windsor. In a December report, the conservation authority cited provincial policy that "development and site alteration shall not be permitted in significant woodlands in Ecoregion 6E." It added, "by clear-cutting the Significant Woodland, there will be a negative impact to the natural feature as the feature will cease to exist, along with the Significant Wildlife Habitat it contains." Mason Homes did not return repeated calls.
The development proposal puts Port Hope council in a tight spot. At 278 square kilometres, this is geographically a big municipality, almost the size of Mississauga. But as a map on the wall at the Port Hope planning office makes clear, provincial policies restrict development to a small quadrant, near Lake Ontario, that includes the woodlot. Only here may Port Hope grow - hence the pressure to approve the Mason Homes project. Council gets the final say on this project.
Meanwhile, the town's tree canopy faces another threat. The Port Hope Area Initiative, funded with $1.3-billion in federal money, aims to clean up low-level radioactive waste dumped here in the mid-20th century. The plan involves cutting trees in many areas to remove contaminated soil beneath. Given this extra threat to local trees, Tom Dodds, Port Hope's director of community development, says, "the issue of trees is incredibly sensitive."
Les Andrews, Port Hope's deputy mayor, understands his town's appeal. "A lot of people from Ajax and Whitby have moved here because they had established a lifestyle that no longer exists - because Whitby has become downtown Toronto," he said.
Still, Mr. Andrews says, "Council and the mayor have to be good listeners on both sides. We have to listen to citizens and we have to listen to the developers and we have to make sense of it all." Port Hope council plans a public meeting on the development on March 10.
Jane Zednik lives north of Port Hope's built-up area and is active in the campaign to save the woods. "We keep losing our biodiversity in Southern Ontario," she said. "It's a death by a thousand cuts."

Housing advocates call for more regulation of above-guideline rent hikes

Full text: THE LISTING Ontario housing advocates are demanding changes to provincial regulations to ensure tenants will be notified when they are owed a rental rebate from landlords.
Anyone who has rented in Ontario in the past decade has likely heard of a landlord requesting an "above-guideline increase," or AGI, to raise rents to help pay for capital repairs or improvements on a building. In the Landlord and Tenant Board's (LTB) most recent annual report, there were 717 applications for a rent increase above the guideline filed in 201819, a 28-per-cent increase from the 559 applications in 2017-18. The totals fluctuate a little each year, but the most recent numbers are almost double the figures from a decade ago: In 2010, there were just 391 AGIs filed.
But few Ontarians know that most AGIs (which are limited to a maximum of 9 per cent) are typically time-limited; they are intended to last only for the "weighted useful life" of the expenditure. That means the rent increase should expire once the cost of the improvements is paid down. When an AGI expires, any tenants who have stayed in the building during that time are entitled to have the AGI increases removed from their rent. In some cases, that can amount to hundreds of dollars a month for tenants. Spread across the province, it could add up to millions in rebates owed as more and more AGI's expire in the coming years.
The Federation of Metro Tenants Associations has been tracking new AGI applications over the past decade, but only now that some of the old orders are expiring has its staff uncovered issues with expirations. A landlord can simply ignore the mandated rent reduction because there's no mechanism that notifies tenants they are owed money, and there's no application a tenant can file with the LTB to enforce a rebate.
It isn't clear how many tenants are owed rebates, not least because there's no provincial or municipal systems for tracking existing AGIs and their expiration dates. The FMTA has collected hundreds of applications, and while it knows of a half-dozen buildings with expiring AGIs in 2020 (and more than two-dozen in 2021) it has more limited data on about a thousand filings. Even with its incomplete data, the group has identified more than 124,000 apartments affected by AGIs filed in the past decade, that at some point will be owed a rent reduction.
Brendan Jowett, a staff lawyer for the downtown Toronto Neighbourhood Legal Services clinic (covering an area between Yonge Street and the Don Valley that includes rental hubs such as Ryerson University, Cabbagetown, the Distillery District and St. James Town) recently sought clarification on how he should advise tenants on the lack of regulation to enforce an AGI-related rent reduction.
Correspondence he received from Steve Clark, the provincial Minister for Municipal Affairs and Housing, suggested Ontario has no plans to change the status quo, but did offer a method for tenants to test their luck: "Since the order requires a landlord to reduce rent, a tenant can enforce the order by simply reducing rent paid to the landlord in accordance with the provisions of the order. If a landlord in such a case were to allege that the tenant is not paying rent owed, the landlord could apply to the LTB based on alleged arrears and demonstrate that the rent charged is lawful," the minister wrote to Mr. Jowett, a member of the FMTA board.
"As far as I'm concerned that wasn't an adequate response," said Suze Morrison, a Toronto MPP and NDP Opposition critic on tenant rights and housing.
"The LTB process can be quite daunting and impose a significant hardship."
Ms. Morrison and her staff recently worked to help tenants in her riding get a rent reduction owed because of an expired AGI.
"What we ended up having to do was we door-knocked the building three or four times to identify tenants, and we had to write a letter to the landlord," Ms. Morrison said. The landlord in that case did not lower the rent on its own when the AGI expired, but after months of organizing and multiple communications, eventually some of the tenants got their rebate. "It shouldn't take an MPP to go and knock on doors in a riding to sort this process out ... but if we hadn't, those tenants would still be paying extra rent."
The Globe and Mail contacted tenants who had successfully obtained AGI-related rent reductions, who were reluctant to speak on the record for fear of reprisal. In one case, a landlord had purchased a building from a previous owner during the period when the AGI was still active, and later attempted to argue the new ownership group would not have to honour rent reductions incurred by the previous owner.
The same landlord argued that a phased-in increase (for example, an increase that rose 3 per cent each year for three years) should be phased out on the same schedule. While there was only one expiration date on the order in that case, tenants were hesitant to run afoul of a landlord's wishes.
Section 131 of the RTA mandates that tenants are entitled to a rent reduction when a landlord's property taxes have been reduced by more than 2.49 per cent from one year to the next. Ontario currently requires municipalities to notify all tenants when a rental building receives such a property tax reduction. According to the Casey Brendan, director in the City of Toronto's Revenue Services department, in 2019 Toronto issued about 9,500 rent reduction notices to landlords and sent 33,000 tenant notices. However, the city does not collect or maintain statistics on the number or whether rent reductions are implemented for individual properties.
Wendy Lum, a tenant organizer with the FMTA, argues the province should mandate that cities perform the same job for AGI reductions. "There's a lot of grey area," Ms. Lum said. "It would be great if the government took that up, so there would be no argument and confusion."
In the meantime, if you're a tenant who kept your paperwork on an AGI and want your rent reduction, Ms. Lum suggests you check with a local legal aid clinic for advice, or even go to an LTB hearing site and seek out the duty counsel.

Full text: Row upon row, they sit. Fake muntin bars in every window, manufactured stone veneer walls, complex roofs peppered with multiple vents to exhaust multiple bathrooms and that mix-and-match of architectural eras - turrets and half-timbering and fake keystones - that most new home developments wear.
Drive too quickly along Dundas Street in north Oakville and that's all that will register, too. But if a traffic jam, say, causes a slowdown around Sixth Line, which divides Dundas into East and West, a handsome, red-brick, late-1800s church, Munn's United, will come into view. And across the road, a cemetery. Perhaps one's GPS will display its name: Munn's Pioneer Cemetery.
And while that same driver - surely in rush to get to work or home - won't venture into that thicket of stone veneer, a quick jog up Post Road, just past the retention pond, would reveal one more piece of the Munn story.
Here, at 3020 Post Rd., the redbrick Jordan Munn house sits, an anachronistic heritage needle in a bland haystack, awaiting new ownership. And those who love heritage can thank the dynamic heritage-loving duo of Mandy Sedgwick and Mirella Marshall for the TLC it has received.
But first a little about the Munns: Daniel Munn, a United Empire Loyalist, built a farm at this intersection in 1803. Soon after, he allowed church services to be held at his home. Mr. Munn, with his wife, Millicent, also operated a tavern and inn for those en route to the waterfront, nine kilometres to the south. By 1844, on land Mr. Munn donated, the first church was built and, by all accounts, Munn's Corners was a happening little hamlet.
According to a 2019 City of Oakville "Notice to Designate," Jordan Munn built himself a timberframed home near his father's at some point between 1816 and 1841, and added a brick portion between 1830 and 1860, "when the Classical Revival style was prevalent in Ontario."
While simple, the Munn home does sport a dramatic roof peak with deep returned eaves, a wide cornice, dual chimneys, symmetrical windows with wooden shutters, neat Common Bond red brick and an off-centre door.
But to learn a little more about the women who co-ordinated moving Mr. Munn's house to that new subdivision, we must fastforward to the 1990s, when both were volunteering at the Milton Historical Society. There, Ms. Sedgwick and Ms. Marshall became key players in saving James Waldie's 1865 blacksmith shop from demolition, which took seven years. (The last blacksmith had been Alfred Waldie, who closed up in the early 1970s.)
"At first, it was really difficult, because nobody could see the potential in the building," says Ms. Sedgwick, who remembers the building from when she was little.
"But once you go in and you see it restored - and now especially with TV shows like Forged in Fire - and now they have blacksmithing classes there. It's really evolved; it's a busy place."
In the early-2000s, with a development boom in Milton and Oakville, the women - who both live in heritage homes - found themselves "fighting to save houses all over the place," Ms. Marshall says.
"It was frustrating, of course," she continues. "So, finally, we just said: ‘What if we use our own resources, let's see if we can just buy a house at a time and see if we can save it and then we'll sell it. And then we'll do it again.' " Their first move as Sedgwick Marshall Heritage Homes Ltd. was one-half of a 1910 duplex in Milton, Ont. A few years later, the duo caught wind of a pair of houses on Mary Street (again, in Milton) that were being offered up by the town so a parking lot could be constructed. With no takers, the women purchased one - a Regency cottage - and had it moved by Charles and Roger Matthews (now both deceased, I met and profiled the brothers in this space in 2004) to a lot they'd purchased around the corner and helped facilitate moving the other one.
After Sedgwick Marshall moved a few more, word got around to developers, who often don't know what to do with the designated century houses that come with their farmer's field purchases. The first to call was Mattamy Homes, who needed a triple-brick, 1850 house once owned by Richard Harrison, the son of Milton's first schoolteacher, moved, restored and updated so it could be put on the market.
In the decade since, with their small crew of carpenters and masons, they've co-ordinated moves for other developers, including a stone house for Branthaven Homes, while continuing to purchase for their own company.
"We understand what the process is, what it is the [heritage] committee looking for," Ms. Marshall says. "So, if a developer brings us in early on, we can help them get through the whole process, because they find that very overwhelming and daunting."
And since new additions are usually required - these are small houses by today's standards - Sedgwick Marshall will ensure they don't overwhelm the original and contain period appropriate finishes.
If there is one tiny complaint this author had after touring the Munn residence a few weeks ago, it's that vintage interiors are nonexistent. Then again, with a price tag of $1.5-million, expecting purchasers to ooh and aah over creaky old cupboards and beat-up wainscotting is a silly notion. It was, however, a real treat to see the rough-hewn, half-logs that have held Mr. Munn's floors up for a century-and-a-half.
"People love these houses.
They just want them finished," Ms. Marshall says simply.
"It's modern amenities in an old shell, basically," Ms. Sedgwick says.
But there's nothing "basic" about it: Commitment, drive, patience and boundless energy are all required to save these pieces of local history and make them marketable to today's harried consumer.

Full text: 268 Henderson Ave., Markham, Ont.
POMONA VALLEY Asking price: $1,750,000 Selling price: $1,698,000 Previous selling price: $1,228,000 (2015) Taxes: $8,750 (2019) Days on the market: 28 Listing agent: Bill Thom, Re/Max Realtron Bill Thom Group Realty Inc.
THE ACTION Just a few doors south of the Ladies' Golf Club of Toronto, this detached house was first listed by its owner. By late October, agent Bill Thom was recruited to market it instead, and a new asking price of $1.75-million was extensively promoted through his client database, local publications and various social-media channels.
"My marketing materials and targets were different, and the price was adjusted because it was too high," Mr. Thom said.
"We had two offers; we took the second one. The first wasn't nearly as good."
WHAT THEY GOT This two-storey, brick house underwent a $400,000 renovation job in 2015.
The roof, windows and doors were replaced, and the 80-footby-140-foot lot was landscaped, complete with a circular stone driveway to the double garage.
Inside, the mechanical systems were updated, and a fourth bedroom was converted into a walk-in closet for the master bedroom, which also houses the largest of five bathrooms.
There are formal living and dining rooms, in addition to casual recreation areas with fireplaces on the main and lower levels. The eat-in kitchen features granite counter tops, heated floors and patio doors to an in-ground pool.
THE AGENT'S TAKE "In that area, it's a fairly good size home with a family room and a main floor library," Mr. Thom said.
"Pomona Valley is an established area in Thornhill, so a lot of properties seem to have a pool - and this one has one too!"

Full text: The Ontario government has named a former chief lobbyist for Toronto's real estate development industry to the province's powerful land-use tribunal, while stripping it of four adjudicators with environmental backgrounds.
The Local Planning Appeal Tribunal (LPAT), formerly known as the Ontario Municipal Board, hears appeals over local development decisions across the province, deciding, for example, how tall condominium towers can be and whether farmland can be turned into subdivisions.
In December, the government appointed Bryan Tuckey, who served as president and chief executive officer of the Building Industry and Land Development Association (BILD) from 2012 to 2017, as a part-time LPAT adjudicator. Mr. Tuckey, also a former chief planner of York Region, was a vocal critic of elements of the previous Liberal government's anti-sprawl policies while at the helm of BILD, whose members include the largest home builders and developers in the Greater Toronto Area.
Meanwhile, the Progressive Conservative government has also declined in recent months to renew the appointments of four LPAT adjudicators with environmental backgrounds. The group includes three who also sat on the province's Environmental Review Tribunal (ERT), which hears appeals on environmental matters, including wind and solar projects.
Those not reappointed to the LPAT with environmental CVs were: Justin Duncan, a former staff lawyer for activist group Ecojustice who once sought a federal NDP nomination in Toronto; Marcia Valiante, a University of Windsor environmental law professor; Hugh Wilkins, a lawyer who worked for the World Wildlife Fund and Ecojustice, and Paula Boutis, an environmental lawyer. All had expected to stay on before the government declined their reappointments, in some cases with little notice. The departures came as the government said it needed more adjudicators to deal with a backlog of housing units before the LPAT - a backlog that the government has blamed for worsening the province's housing crunch.
Mr. Duncan, now a lawyer for the City of Winnipeg, said he is concerned that the two tribunals will lack a wide cross-section of people with different views: "Anybody who had ever been a publicinterest environmental lawyer or consultant or worked with an environmental group was shown the door."
Toronto City Councillor Josh Matlow, a vocal critic of the LPAT and the Ford government's other moves to reduce burdens on developers, said the appointments should be a concern to everyone in Ontario.
"Ford is choosing people who will put developers' financial interests ... over the interests of communities and the environment," Mr. Matlow said.
A spokeswoman for Tribunals Ontario, which oversees the LPAT, said Mr. Tuckey declined to comment for this story. When he appeared before the legislature's standing committee on government agencies in December, Mr. Tuckey noted that his time advocating for developers ended in 2017.
Even as head of BILD, he said, he was bound by the rules of the planning profession, and "was a planner first and acted in the public interest." He also noted his decades of public service as a planner in York Region and North York, and said he would "unbiased and professional."
The LPAT has been a focus for the Ford government, which last year scrapped the previous Liberal government's changes that scaled back the tribunal's powers and gave municipalities more say over land-use planning. The development industry welcomed the PC government's reversals, saying it would reduce the power of local councillors to block projects. Prospective LPAT adjudicators apply through the government's Public Appointments Secretariat. Appointments are recommended by Attorney-General Doug Downey and approved by cabinet. The LPAT has more than 30 members, and includes lawyers, planners and former municipal politicians. Full-time adjudicators start at $110,000 a year, while part-time adjudicators earn at least $427 a day.
Legislation brought by the Liberals in 2009 said the appointment process should be meritbased, and that the criteria for candidates must include both "experience, knowledge or training in the subject matter and legal issues dealt with by the tribunal" and "aptitude for impartial adjudication."
Jenessa Crognali, a spokeswoman for Mr. Downey, said the appointments are made in consultation with the LPAT and Tribunals Ontario, and that all candidates go through a competitive interview process. She said the government has appointed 18 new members and reappointed six members in the past seven months alone. As a result, she said, the tribunal is resolving cases at a faster rate and has since reduced the LPAT's backlog of cases by almost 20 per cent.
But among those new members are also at least two LPAT adjudicators with PC ties.
In June, the government named David Brown, a planning consultant who is also a threetime failed former PC candidate - most recently in 2014 in Hamilton-Stoney Creek - to the tribunal.
And in September, the government appointed Steven Cooke, a former school trustee and oneterm town councillor in Clarington, Ont., to the LPAT. He lost his bid for re-election to Clarington Council in 2018. Previously, he sought the PC nomination in Durham in 2014. Mr. Cooke has also served as the local riding association's vice-president and worked as an aide to then-provincial PC cabinet minister Jim Flaherty and Conservative federal finance minister Joe Oliver.
Mr. Brown did not respond to an e-mail requesting comment. A spokeswoman with Tribunals Ontario said Mr. Brown declined to comment. Mr. Cooke, reached at his home in Bowmanville and asked about his party connections, said his post is "supposed to be apolitical." His four years on Clarington's council and eight years as a school trustee, he said, are an asset in making decisions on the LPAT.
The Ford government has faced steady criticism for appointments handed to people with party links or relationships with the Premier's inner circle. Most prominent among them was the government's attempt to hire Toronto Police Superintendent Ron Taverner, a personal friend of the Premier, as commissioner of the Ontario Provincial Police.
NDP MPP Taras Natyshak, the opposition's ethics critic, said the latest appointments are more of the same and threaten to undermine public confidence in the LPAT. "It's a disturbing pattern and it shows that Doug Ford has not learned his lesson," Mr. Natyshak said.

Full text: The Ontario NDP wants provincial election officials to investigate any possible links between the Progressive Conservative government and an obscure group called Vaughan Working Families, which was behind a series of pro-government newspaper ads.
The ads, which ran last weekend in The Globe and Mail, the Toronto Star, the National Post and the Toronto Sun, echo the government's language in its labour dispute with the province's teachers and accuse the unions of using students as "pawns." The ads appeared just after talks between the government and the unions broke down and teachers vowed to continue an escalating series of one-day walkouts.
A spokeswoman for Education Minister Stephen Lecce - who represents a Vaughan riding - said Mr. Lecce had no role in or any knowledge of the ads before they ran. The office of Premier Doug Ford and the PC Party also issued similar statements.
On Friday, NDP MPP Peter Tabuns wrote a letter to Greg Essensa, Ontario's Chief Electoral Officer, calling for an investigation into whether Vaughan Working Families was working "in collusion" with the PC government, which Mr. Tabuns said would violate the Election Finances Act.
Under the act, third-party political advertisers are not allowed to "act in co-ordination" with political parties or candidates. The NDP has also raised concerns that the ads ran as two Ottawa-area by-elections are under way. Elections Ontario said Friday it does not comment on investigations.
The name Vaughan Working Families was registered in 2018 by a corporation called Vaughan Health Campus of Care. According to corporate records, the corporation's president is prominent Toronto-area developer Michael DeGasperis, a donor to the PC Party. Mr. DeGasperis did not respond to requests for comment.
The lawyer who registered the name, who is also listed as a director of Vaughan Health Campus of Care, is Quinto Annibale, a large donor to the PC Party whom the Ford government has named vice-chairman of the Liquor Control Board of Ontario.
In a story published online Thursday evening, the Toronto Star reported that invoices for the ads had been sent to the offices of Mr. Annibale's Etobicoke law firm, Loopstra Nixon LLP. The law firm's address is also the listed address for Vaughan Health Campus of Care. Full-page ads would typically cost tens of thousands of dollars each.
Mr. Annibale did not respond to requests for comment.
On Friday, the law firm's managing partner, Allan Ritchie, issued a statement saying that Mr. Annibale serves on the board of Vaughan Working Families/Vaughan Health Campus of Care in his personal capacity. The statement said the views expressed by the group were not those of the law firm or its staff, which hold a "wide variety of political opinions."
Mr. Tabuns acknowledged he had no evidence that the government was involved in co-ordinating the ads. But he said the situation warranted a probe.
"The story that Lecce and the Ford government knew absolutely nothing about a six-figure campaign run by a party insider is simply not believable," Mr. Tabuns told reporters at Queen's Park.
According to corporate records, Vaughan Health Campus of Care was established in 2007. The organization was set up to lobby for a new hospital in Vaughan, aiming to raise private- and public-sector funds for it and seeking to be involved in its construction. But the advocacy group became embroiled in a tangled dispute with the city and the province over its role in the development of some of the land earmarked for the facility.
In addition to Mr. DeGasperis and Mr. Annibale, the other listed directors of Vaughan Health Campus of Care are: Sam Ciccolini, co-founder of Toronto construction insurance firm Masters Insurance and a well-known philanthropist; Robert Colelli, a senior vice-president of the commercial real estate firm Cresa; and Robert Maggisano, an affiliate scientist in cardiac and vascular surgery at Toronto's Sunnybrook Hospital. None responded to repeated requests for comment this week.
All have donated money to the PC Party in the past. Mr. Annibale and his professional corporation have given more than $30,000 to the PC Party and various PC candidates since 2014, according to Elections Ontario's financial contributions database.
Mr. DeGasperis has donated to both the Liberals and Progressive Conservatives. Mr. Ciccolini has given nearly $11,000 to the PC Party or its candidates since 2014, while Mr. Colelli and Dr. Maggisano each donated smaller amounts.
Alexandra Adamo, a spokeswoman for Mr. Lecce, said the minister had not spoken to any of the men about the ads: "The Minister was not involved or aware of the creation of these advertisements."
According to Elections Ontario, Vaughan Health Campus of Care was registered as a third-party political advertiser in 2018 and in 2014. Elections Ontario says third-party advertisers must register upon spending $500 during an election period. The group spent just $5,922 from May to September of 2018 on third-party political activity, according to election records, and $83,768.27 from May to September, 2014.
Vaughan Health Campus of Care made headlines in 2011 when critics seized on a move by the then-Conservative federal government to pledge $10-million toward the group's efforts to develop plans for ancillary health-care facilities that would accompany the new hospital. The grant money was promised just after local Conservative MP Julian Fantino won a 2010 by-election. Mr. DeGasperis and Mr. Ciccolini were both fundraisers for Mr. Fantino's campaign, according to media reports at the time.
But as Vaughan Health Campus of Care's vision ran into various obstacles, it would only end up receiving $1.2-million of the federal funding, which it spent on consultants to draw up its plans, the Vaughan Citizen reported in 2012.
Mr. Lecce, a former aide to prime minister Stephen Harper, worked as campaign spokesman for Mr. Fantino in 2011.
Reached this week, Mr. Fantino - who left politics in 2015 after losing his seat - said he did not know who was behind Vaughan Working Families.
The Globe and Mail declined to comment on the ad. Calls or e-mails to the Star and Postmedia, owners of the Sun and the National Post, were not returned. The Star has said the ad did not meet its standards and slipped through inadvertently.

Full text: The Ontario government has named a former chief lobbyist for Toronto’s real estate development industry to the province’s powerful land-use tribunal, while stripping it of four adjudicators with environmental backgrounds.
The Local Planning Appeal Tribunal (LPAT), formerly known as the Ontario Municipal Board, hears appeals over local development decisions across the province, deciding, for example, how tall condominium towers can be and whether farmland can be turned into subdivisions.
In December, the government appointed Bryan Tuckey, who served as president and chief executive officer of the Building Industry and Land Development Association (BILD) from 2012 to 2017, as a part-time LPAT adjudicator. Mr. Tuckey, also a former chief planner of York Region, was a vocal critic of elements of the previous Liberal government’s anti-sprawl policies while at the helm of BILD, whose members include the largest home builders and developers in the Greater Toronto Area.
Meanwhile, the Progressive Conservative government has also declined in recent months to renew the appointments of four LPAT adjudicators with environmental backgrounds. The group includes three who also sat on the province’s Environmental Review Tribunal (ERT), which hears appeals on environmental matters, including wind and solar projects.
Those not reappointed to the LPAT with environmental CVs were: Justin Duncan, a former staff lawyer for activist group Ecojustice who once sought a federal NDP nomination in Toronto; Marcia Valiante, a University of Windsor environmental law professor; Hugh Wilkins, a lawyer who worked for the World Wildlife Fund and Ecojustice, and Paula Boutis, an environmental lawyer. All had expected to stay on before the government declined their reappointments, in some cases with little notice. The departures came as the government said it needed more adjudicators to deal with a backlog of housing units before the LPAT – a backlog that the government has blamed for worsening the province’s housing crunch.
Mr. Duncan, now a lawyer for the City of Winnipeg, said he is concerned that the two tribunals will lack a wide cross-section of people with different views: “Anybody who had ever been a publicinterest environmental lawyer or consultant or worked with an environmental group was shown the door.”
Toronto City Councillor Josh Matlow, a vocal critic of the LPAT and the Ford government’s other moves to reduce burdens on developers, said the appointments should be a concern to everyone in Ontario.
“Ford is choosing people who will put developers’ financial interests … over the interests of communities and the environment,” Mr. Matlow said.
A spokeswoman for Tribunals Ontario, which oversees the LPAT, said Mr. Tuckey declined to comment for this story. When he appeared before the legislature’s standing committee on government agencies in December, Mr. Tuckey noted that his time advocating for developers ended in 2017.
Even as head of BILD, he said, he was bound by the rules of the planning profession, and “was a planner first and acted in the public interest.” He also noted his decades of public service as a planner in York Region and North York, and said he would “unbiased and professional.”
The LPAT has been a focus for the Ford government, which last year scrapped the previous Liberal government’s changes that scaled back the tribunal’s powers and gave municipalities more say over land-use planning. The development industry welcomed the PC government’s reversals, saying it would reduce the power of local councillors to block projects. Prospective LPAT adjudicators apply through the government’s Public Appointments Secretariat. Appointments are recommended by Attorney-General Doug Downey and approved by cabinet. The LPAT has more than 30 members, and includes lawyers, planners and former municipal politicians. Full-time adjudicators start at $110,000 a year, while part-time adjudicators earn at least $427 a day.
Legislation brought by the Liberals in 2009 said the appointment process should be meritbased, and that the criteria for candidates must include both “experience, knowledge or training in the subject matter and legal issues dealt with by the tribunal” and “aptitude for impartial adjudication.”
Jenessa Crognali, a spokeswoman for Mr. Downey, said the appointments are made in consultation with the LPAT and Tribunals Ontario, and that all candidates go through a competitive interview process. She said the government has appointed 18 new members and reappointed six members in the past seven months alone. As a result, she said, the tribunal is resolving cases at a faster rate and has since reduced the LPAT’s backlog of cases by almost 20 per cent.
But among those new members are also at least two LPAT adjudicators with PC ties.
In June, the government named David Brown, a planning consultant who is also a threetime failed former PC candidate – most recently in 2014 in Hamilton-Stoney Creek – to the tribunal.
And in September, the government appointed Steven Cooke, a former school trustee and oneterm town councillor in Clarington, Ont., to the LPAT. He lost his bid for re-election to Clarington Council in 2018. Previously, he sought the PC nomination in Durham in 2014. Mr. Cooke has also served as the local riding association’s vice-president and worked as an aide to then-provincial PC cabinet minister Jim Flaherty and Conservative federal finance minister Joe Oliver.
Mr. Brown did not respond to an e-mail requesting comment. A spokeswoman with Tribunals Ontario said Mr. Brown declined to comment. Mr. Cooke, reached at his home in Bowmanville and asked about his party connections, said his post is “supposed to be apolitical.” His four years on Clarington’s council and eight years as a school trustee, he said, are an asset in making decisions on the LPAT.
The Ford government has faced steady criticism for appointments handed to people with party links or relationships with the Premier’s inner circle. Most prominent among them was the government’s attempt to hire Toronto Police Superintendent Ron Taverner, a personal friend of the Premier, as commissioner of the Ontario Provincial Police.
NDP MPP Taras Natyshak, the opposition’s ethics critic, said the latest appointments are more of the same and threaten to undermine public confidence in the LPAT. “It’s a disturbing pattern and it shows that Doug Ford has not learned his lesson,” Mr. Natyshak said.

Full text: The Ontario NDP wants provincial election officials to investigate any possible links between the Progressive Conservative government and an obscure group called Vaughan Working Families, which was behind a series of pro-government newspaper ads.
The ads, which ran last weekend in The Globe and Mail, the Toronto Star, the National Post and the Toronto Sun, echo the government’s language in its labour dispute with the province’s teachers and accuse the unions of using students as “pawns.” The ads appeared just after talks between the government and the unions broke down and teachers vowed to continue an escalating series of one-day walkouts.
A spokeswoman for Education Minister Stephen Lecce – who represents a Vaughan riding – said Mr. Lecce had no role in or any knowledge of the ads before they ran. The office of Premier Doug Ford and the PC Party also issued similar statements.
On Friday, NDP MPP Peter Tabuns wrote a letter to Greg Essensa, Ontario’s Chief Electoral Officer, calling for an investigation into whether Vaughan Working Families was working “in collusion” with the PC government, which Mr. Tabuns said would violate the Election Finances Act.
Under the act, third-party political advertisers are not allowed to “act in co-ordination” with political parties or candidates. The NDP has also raised concerns that the ads ran as two Ottawa-area by-elections are under way. Elections Ontario said Friday it does not comment on investigations.
The name Vaughan Working Families was registered in 2018 by a corporation called Vaughan Health Campus of Care. According to corporate records, the corporation’s president is prominent Toronto-area developer Michael DeGasperis, a donor to the PC Party. Mr. DeGasperis did not respond to requests for comment.
The lawyer who registered the name, who is also listed as a director of Vaughan Health Campus of Care, is Quinto Annibale, a large donor to the PC Party whom the Ford government has named vice-chairman of the Liquor Control Board of Ontario.
In a story published online Thursday evening, the Toronto Star reported that invoices for the ads had been sent to the offices of Mr. Annibale’s Etobicoke law firm, Loopstra Nixon LLP. The law firm’s address is also the listed address for Vaughan Health Campus of Care. Full-page ads would typically cost tens of thousands of dollars each.
Mr. Annibale did not respond to requests for comment.
On Friday, the law firm’s managing partner, Allan Ritchie, issued a statement saying that Mr. Annibale serves on the board of Vaughan Working Families/Vaughan Health Campus of Care in his personal capacity. The statement said the views expressed by the group were not those of the law firm or its staff, which hold a “wide variety of political opinions.”
Mr. Tabuns acknowledged he had no evidence that the government was involved in co-ordinating the ads. But he said the situation warranted a probe.
“The story that Lecce and the Ford government knew absolutely nothing about a six-figure campaign run by a party insider is simply not believable,” Mr. Tabuns told reporters at Queen’s Park.
According to corporate records, Vaughan Health Campus of Care was established in 2007. The organization was set up to lobby for a new hospital in Vaughan, aiming to raise private- and public-sector funds for it and seeking to be involved in its construction. But the advocacy group became embroiled in a tangled dispute with the city and the province over its role in the development of some of the land earmarked for the facility.
In addition to Mr. DeGasperis and Mr. Annibale, the other listed directors of Vaughan Health Campus of Care are: Sam Ciccolini, co-founder of Toronto construction insurance firm Masters Insurance and a well-known philanthropist; Robert Colelli, a senior vice-president of the commercial real estate firm Cresa; and Robert Maggisano, an affiliate scientist in cardiac and vascular surgery at Toronto’s Sunnybrook Hospital. None responded to repeated requests for comment this week.
All have donated money to the PC Party in the past. Mr. Annibale and his professional corporation have given more than $30,000 to the PC Party and various PC candidates since 2014, according to Elections Ontario’s financial contributions database.
Mr. DeGasperis has donated to both the Liberals and Progressive Conservatives. Mr. Ciccolini has given nearly $11,000 to the PC Party or its candidates since 2014, while Mr. Colelli and Dr. Maggisano each donated smaller amounts.
Alexandra Adamo, a spokeswoman for Mr. Lecce, said the minister had not spoken to any of the men about the ads: “The Minister was not involved or aware of the creation of these advertisements.”
According to Elections Ontario, Vaughan Health Campus of Care was registered as a third-party political advertiser in 2018 and in 2014. Elections Ontario says third-party advertisers must register upon spending $500 during an election period. The group spent just $5,922 from May to September of 2018 on third-party political activity, according to election records, and $83,768.27 from May to September, 2014.
Vaughan Health Campus of Care made headlines in 2011 when critics seized on a move by the then-Conservative federal government to pledge $10-million toward the group’s efforts to develop plans for ancillary health-care facilities that would accompany the new hospital. The grant money was promised just after local Conservative MP Julian Fantino won a 2010 by-election. Mr. DeGasperis and Mr. Ciccolini were both fundraisers for Mr. Fantino’s campaign, according to media reports at the time.
But as Vaughan Health Campus of Care’s vision ran into various obstacles, it would only end up receiving $1.2-million of the federal funding, which it spent on consultants to draw up its plans, the Vaughan Citizen reported in 2012.
Mr. Lecce, a former aide to prime minister Stephen Harper, worked as campaign spokesman for Mr. Fantino in 2011.
Reached this week, Mr. Fantino – who left politics in 2015 after losing his seat – said he did not know who was behind Vaughan Working Families.
The Globe and Mail declined to comment on the ad. Calls or e-mails to the Star and Postmedia, owners of the Sun and the National Post, were not returned. The Star has said the ad did not meet its standards and slipped through inadvertently.

Full text: THE LISTING Residents of a boutique Hamilton condominium are contemplating selling off the entire building and terminating the condo corporation as a way to ward off a financially ruinous special assessment for repairs.
According to some of the building's owners, studies commissioned by the condo board show a series of construction issues have created the need to raise as much as $3-million. Because there are only 12 units in the building and 11 owners, even if the bill for repairs was spread out, each unit-holder could end up on the hook for as much as $250,000.
"It's insane. It's the worst real estate transaction I've done in my life," said Nancy Forrester, a Hamilton real estate agent and a former member of the condo board, speaking of her decision to buy in the building at 35-43 Duke St. in 2014. "I look at the worst-case scenario: Either we can't sell [the building] for enough, or we make 12 people go bankrupt and then the property is worth nothing."
Built in 1856, the limestone building is a federally and provincially recognized heritage property known as Sandyford Place. It's comprised of a row of four triplex townhouses, and is done in a Renaissance Revival style typical of this era of pre-Confederation Hamilton. The row was formerly owned by the City of Hamilton and was converted into a single condominium corporation after its 1979 heritage designation.
None of the owners from that time remain in the building, but, according to property records some residents have been there for decades. The current condo corporation, Wentworth Condominium Corp. No. 96, was registered in 1984.
The most critical repairs relate to a balcony on the rear of the building: Installed by the City of Hamilton, the balcony provides rear-access for several units.
There's an often-broken elevator for accessibility, the repair schedule for which has been the subject of Human Rights Tribunal hearings and complaints in recent years.
"There had been plans to do work on the balcony pretty much most of the time I've been there.
They were originally talking about repairing it, but we've gotten to the point where that repair doesn't seem to be enough," Ms. Forrester said. The steel and concrete structure apparently has significant corrosion and water damage. "The problem is in getting people to agree what needs to be done. We got different opinions from engineers and we put it out to tender, results came back with $1.4-million to $1.8-million."
Under Ontario's Condominium Act, condo boards must perform reserve fund studies to ensure the corporation has the money to pay for needed maintenance to a building's common elements.
When the funds are short, the board can issue legally binding special assessments that owners must pay. Failure to pay can result in a condo board taking back a unit and reselling it. Residents say Sandyford Place's most recent reserve fund study suggests the corporation needs to raise close to $3-million.
"In principal, I completely approve of selling the building," said Philip Gardner, a reverend with West Plains United Church. "It's not that I don't love the place ... the building has aged and we've ended up financially on the hook for it. There's coping with the $20,000 variety [of special assessments], which I've had to do twice in three years, but what happens when a special assessment is catastrophic? Selling the building to some agency with deeper pockets seemed to be the only way out. My personal bill was $280,000 ... there's no way I can borrow that."
The process the board is contemplating is found in section 124 of the Condominium Act. It allows for a corporation to dissolve itself and distribute the proceeds of a sale of all the units and the land the building sits on. This procedure has only been used once before in Ontario, in 2017.
The first step is to find a buyer.
In November, the board listed the entire building for sale for $4,999,999, and according to Ms. Forrester it was conditionally sold, but negotiations on price and other issues are currently ongoing. Section 124 requires that 80 per cent of owners and lenders in a building agree to the terms of the sale. And the process differs in other ways from a typical real estate transaction. For instance, "on closing, there's no discharge of the mortgages - they are just wiped off title," said Greg Marley, a real estate lawyer who worked on the sale of 39 Roehampton Ave. in Toronto, a 27-unit condo and the province's only prior Section 124 transaction. "There was no process in place to address it. We gave comfort letters to each of the banks letting them know the loans would be repaid. A couple had some issues and we had to walk them through the process."
Mr. Gardner bought his unit in 1999, making him the longest-tenured resident after Joan MacDonald, who has been in the building since 1989. Ms. MacDonald, formerly the condo board's president, has brought a number of legal actions against the condo board in recent years and is currently embroiled in litigation with the corporation. In 2017, the corporation filed a lien for $12,529 against the title of her townhouse in relation to a previous special assessment (she repaid and discharged that lien).
The current condo board president is Sam Nash, a partner in Hamilton's George Street Law LLC, and head of its commercial litigation group. Mr. Nash, who bought his townhouse in 2014, was unavailable for comment. Chris Kernjeta (who purchased his unit in 2014), is also on the condo board, but didn't respond to attempts to contact him. Anna Procwat, who with her husband, Eugene Miner, owns two townhouses (one purchased in 2003 and the other for well-below market price in 2018) in the complex and was recently added to the condo board, declined to comment when reached. Ms. Procwat's brother, Alex, also owns a unit in the building, purchased in 2008. Donna Bacher, a local realtor, believes the individual condos could fetch as much as $750,000 on the market and she has heard from some residents who worry any offer might not reflect fair value.
"I can see this is a very vulnerable group of people; they don't live extravagant lives," Ms. Bacher said. Some of the units in the complex are 2,000 square feet in size.
In a tightening downtown Hamilton market, people might be taking on new debt in retirement or near-retirement to move into a condo apartment half that size in a new building such as the nearby Connaught on King Street.
Greg Evans, a broker with Behar Group Realty Inc. who worked on the Roehampton deal, has consulted on a number of Section 124 attempts since 2017, but none have come to fruition. He predicts that more will happen, particularly to smaller condo buildings on land with great development potential and where it's not as difficult to wrangle all the parties. The trickiest part, he said, is managing expectations.
"I think there's an immediate response from the owners: They think it's a lottery ticket. ... This land is worth a fortune because they are going to build a condo here and they don't know the timelines and economics and the risks involved from the development side," Mr. Evans said.
"[In Roehampton] we were able to educate the owners and manage their expectations, while at the same time give them the confidence they weren't being taken advantage of by the big bad development community."
In the case of Sandyford Place, the motivation to sell seems to be the stick of a special assessment more than the carrot of a developer's offer. But Mr. Marley suggests there is a third way: "Loans are an option: The act requires if you're going to borrow any money [as a corporation] you have to pass a by-law." Paying off the loan would raise the condo's fees, but it might not require an enormous special assessment. Sandyford's condo board has yet to present any finalized purchase offers to its membership for a vote.

A story in Friday's Real Estate section regarding a Hamilton condominium facing a $3-million repair bill contained a reference to a lien on one owner's property that had been paid out. In fact, the owner, Joan MacDonald, is disputing the lien in court.

Full text: Google plans to more than triple its work force in Canada over the next three years to as many as 5,000 employees across Toronto, Montreal and Ontario's Kitchener-Waterloo region.
The expansion will include three new offices, the company said Thursday, with the biggest growth in Kitchener, where it could have up to 3,000 employees working by 2022.
Google declined to say how much it would spend on the plan, which follows similar expansion proposals from Amazon.com Inc.
and Shopify Inc. in Vancouver, and is expected to help stem the brain drain of Canadian talent to Silicon Valley - although it may also compound the shortage of tech workers for the domestic startup ecosystem.
Ruth Porat, the chief financial officer for Google parent Alphabet Inc., made the announcement in Toronto on Thursday. "We see incredible momentum in Canada in our business, and we want to have the capacity for it," she said in an interview.
In last year's federal election campaign, all major parties promised to tax the revenue of advertising-driven digital giants such as California-based Alphabet. But internal communications from the Prime Minister's Office, obtained last year by The Globe and Mail, show that Justin Trudeau and his government have an interest in expanding Alphabet's presence in Canada.
In an e-mail, Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains called the announcement "a testament to our country's reputation as one of the world's most innovative economies," adding that Ottawa hopes it will nurture a tech ecosystem that will also allow Canadian companies to "thrive and scale."
Hiring thousands of positions, however, can have cascading consequences. Benjamin Bergen, executive director of the Council of Canadian Innovators, said that while new jobs are always helpful to the technology ecosystem, "this creates serious pressures on Canadian companies trying to grow, employ more Canadians in both technical and non-technical fields, and commercialize their technology from Canada to the benefit of all Canadians."
The expansion marks a significant investment in Canada by one of the world's biggest companies.
Google has bet big on Canadian talent before, hiring University of Toronto professor emeritus Geoffrey Hinton - considered the "godfather" of the deep-learning branch of artificial intelligence - in 2013. The company also announced Thursday that it would give $2.5-million for scholarships to charity NPower Canada, a digital-skills training organization, for certification programs.
Google's Kitchener expansion is to include a previously announced new facility across the street from its current office to flesh out its cloud services, Gmail, Chrome browser and other teams.
It will also include an accelerator for startups - part of a global network of startup hubs that have received mixed public responses.
"We want to identify interesting companies from across the country where we think we can add value," said Steve Woods, Google's Kitchener-based senior engineering director.
Its Montreal team will expand to as many as 1,000 employees in an office on Avenue Viger Ouest as it builds out a previously announced development studio for its gaming service, Stadia. And its Toronto operations will be based in a new downtown building near King and Yonge streets, housing as many as 1,000 people in cloud, artificial intelligence and sales and marketing teams there.
Alphabet's Ms. Porat said the new Toronto office would not necessarily interfere with a proposal revealed in January by Google's urban-planning sister company, Sidewalk Labs, to build a headquarters at Quayside, the 12acre plot along Lake Ontario that Sidewalk Labs won the right to plan in 2017. "That's certainly an opportunity," she said, but deferred to negotiations with public agency Waterfront Toronto that are "still in the process."
Sidewalk chief executive officer Dan Doctoroff suggested last month that a Google headquarters could be built at Quayside after Waterfront Toronto declined in October to grant Sidewalk access to a broader site for its plans for a technology-filled "smartcity" development.
Ms. Porat declined to answer questions about Alphabet's view of the Quayside project, including whether the parent company would be willing to absorb extra costs from deploying new technologies - except to echo Mr. Doctoroff in saying that it would need to be financially viable. (Either Waterfront or Sidewalk could still walk away before the public agency's board votes May 20 on whether to proceed.)
Domestic and international technology giants have been on Canadian hiring sprees in recent months. Google's expansion intentions come after a series of tech-sector job announcements in Vancouver, where Amazon will lease enough space for 10,000 workers, and in Ottawa, with ecommerce company Shopify planning to hire 1,000 employees for a new office. Unlike Mastercard International Inc., which just announced a new, $510-million cybersecurity office in Vancouver, Google said it had not accepted grant money from the Canadian government for its expansion.
Mr. Bergen, whose innovators' organization represents more than 100 fast-growing Canadian tech companies, said he worried that Canada does not focus enough on its domestic industry.
"Our politicians, policy makers and industry leaders need to focus their efforts on supporting the growth of Canadian-based companies that are already generating job growth, but also all the attendant wealth effects associated with being an anchor firm in Canada."
The consequences of such a hiring spree would spread beyond the tech sector, which would see salary increases and talent wars in Google's expansion regions. In Vancouver's case, where Amazon could employ as many as 10,000 people, local industry leaders expect postsecondary institutions and retraining centres to expand, while its real estate market would get tighter and more expensive.

Full text: 199 Allan St.
OAKVILLE, ONT.
Asking Price: $2,299,000 Taxes: $7,940 (2019) Lot Size: 34 feet by 142 feet Agent: Alex Irish (Sotheby’s International Realty Canada) THE BACKSTORY For 40 years or so, the circa 1925 house at 199 Allan St. was home to the same Oakville family. Eventually they sold the red-brick house to a builder who started a top-to-bottom renovation. But the project stalled and the property landed back on the market in 2016.
That’s when Christine Hibberd Ionescu and Andrei Ionescu came along.
Ms. Hibberd Ionescu, an orthodontist, and her husband, an endodontist, were both starting out in their careers. The couple also had two children and a third on the way. They saw the unfinished property as an opportunity to move into the coveted Old Oakville area.
“When we purchased it, it was torn apart,” Ms. Hibberd Ionescu says. “It was down to the studs.”
By coincidence, her sister had bid on the property a few years earlier but lost out to the builder.
But Ms. Hibberd Ionescu knew a little of the house’s history and that it had been well cared for by the previous family.
And because the renovation was in the early stages, the couple had the chance to tweak the plans to suit their family.
“Our biggest thing was we were able to customize it,” Ms. Hibberd Ionescu says.
They wanted to preserve many of the house’s traditional details, such as the original banister on the staircase, the heavy oak front door,and the antique grates over the heating vents.
They both loved the wavy old glass in the windows at the front of the house. At that time, the basement hadn’t been excavated and the rear addition hadn’t been built, but the couple could envision a large and family friendly home.
THE HOUSE TODAY The Ionescus continued working with the builder, who dug out the basement and put a two-storey addition on the rear.
The expanded house has five bedrooms and four bathrooms in 2,835 square feet of above-ground living space.
The house is located in the Trafalgar Heritage Conservation District, so the couple followed the guidance of the Oakville Heritage Committee in refurbishing the exterior and choosing historic paint colours.
The couple oversaw the project while working at their busy dental practices and raising their young sons.
“It was sort of a whirlwind,” Ms. Hibberd Ionescu says.
Ms. Hibberd Ionescu grew up in Oakville in a family of nine children and today her parents and several of her siblings live in the area. As her parents began planning to downsize from their large house, she anticipated that the Allan Street house would take over as the setting for gatherings of their large clan.
She and her husband ensured the house can comfortably accommodate plenty of visitors. Sitdown dinners for 16 people are a regular event and the youngest generation now includes 12 grandchildren.
The original house was expanded at the rear to create a great room with a large, open kitchen and a lounging area with a gas fireplace. The dining area has a built-in corner bench under the window.
“We put a lot of little people in here so the bench was really important to us.”
The kitchen has floor-to-ceiling white cabinets, a large island and a chef’s range for Mr. Ionescu, who loves to cook for family parties.
The great room’s sliding doors open to the deck and backyard.
A butler’s pantry provides lots of storage space and a connection to the formal dining room, which also served for a time as a mainfloor space for the little ones.
“This was the playroom, which was ideal because I could see them right from the kitchen,” Ms. Hibberd Ionescu says.
The family rarely uses the front door, Ms. Hibberd Ionescu says.
Instead, they use a side entrance that leads right into the mud room with lots of built-in storage.
The kids also use that door to head outside, with the side and rear yards enclosed by a fence.
“If the kids go out, they can go right into the backyard and I don’t have to worry about them wandering.”
The main floor also has a powder room and a music room where the kids play piano.
Ms. Hibberd Ionescu says the couple planned to stay until the kids were grown.
“We really planned for this to be our forever home – then we had another baby.”
With four children now, they’ve done some more rejigging of the rooms.
Upstairs, three-year-old Amy and two-year-old Leah each have their own room on the second floor. The home’s original cramped bathroom has been expanded to provide a larger shared bath for the girls.
A master suite at the rear of the house has a bedroom with cathedral ceilings, an ensuite bathroom with a stand-alone tub and walk-in shower, and his-and-hers walk-in closets. Another room in the suite is currently an office but has been a nursery for the littlest ones.
Throughout the house, closets have been made larger and extra cupboards have been tucked under the stairs.
“Every nook and cranny has stuff.”
After their youngest child arrived, the Ionescus decided to renovate the third floor and create a bedroom for Jack, 7 and Henry, 6.
The boys share a bathroom with a shower on that floor.
“They love it up here,” Ms. Hibberd Ionescu says.
Downstairs, the basement has a large recreation room and a guest bedroom and bathroom.
Ms. Hibberd Ionescu says the neighbourhood has lots for the kids to do. There’s a community centre with a skating rink and the kids visit a nearby park nearly every day. The shops and restaurants of Lakeshore Road are a short walk away.
“It’s a really lovely area – I know all the neighbours,” she says.
THE BEST FEATURE The large backyard has an interlock brick patio and an outdoor kitchen with a built-in barbecue and beer taps. There’s a spacious lounging area around the gas fireplace.
A line of columnar Dawyck beech trees provides privacy and four-season interest in the garden.
Some winters, Mr. Ionescu creates a backyard skating rink for the kids.
There’s also a hot tub, which the family uses often. Sometimes the family stages outdoor entertainment nights, with movies or basketball games projected onto the fence.
“The kids love it,” Ms. Hibberd Ionescu says.

Full text: A story in Friday’s Real Estate section regarding a Hamilton condominium facing a $3-million repair bill contained a reference to a lien on one owner’s property that had been paid out. In fact, the owner, Joan MacDonald, is disputing the lien in court.

THE LISTING Residents of a boutique Hamilton condominium are contemplating selling off the entire building and terminating the condo corporation as a way to ward off a financially ruinous special assessment for repairs.
According to some of the building’s owners, studies commissioned by the condo board show a series of construction issues have created the need to raise as much as $3-million. Because there are only 12 units in the building and 11 owners, even if the bill for repairs was spread out, each unit-holder could end up on the hook for as much as $250,000.
“It’s insane. It’s the worst real estate transaction I’ve done in my life,” said Nancy Forrester, a Hamilton real estate agent and a former member of the condo board, speaking of her decision to buy in the building at 35-43 Duke St. in 2014. “I look at the worst-case scenario: Either we can’t sell [the building] for enough, or we make 12 people go bankrupt and then the property is worth nothing.”
Built in 1856, the limestone building is a federally and provincially recognized heritage property known as Sandyford Place. It’s comprised of a row of four triplex townhouses, and is done in a Renaissance Revival style typical of this era of pre-Confederation Hamilton. The row was formerly owned by the City of Hamilton and was converted into a single condominium corporation after its 1979 heritage designation.
None of the owners from that time remain in the building, but, according to property records some residents have been there for decades. The current condo corporation, Wentworth Condominium Corp. No. 96, was registered in 1984.
The most critical repairs relate to a balcony on the rear of the building: Installed by the City of Hamilton, the balcony provides rear-access for several units.
There’s an often-broken elevator for accessibility, the repair schedule for which has been the subject of Human Rights Tribunal hearings and complaints in recent years.
“There had been plans to do work on the balcony pretty much most of the time I’ve been there.
They were originally talking about repairing it, but we’ve gotten to the point where that repair doesn’t seem to be enough,” Ms. Forrester said. The steel and concrete structure apparently has significant corrosion and water damage. “The problem is in getting people to agree what needs to be done. We got different opinions from engineers and we put it out to tender, results came back with $1.4-million to $1.8-million.”
Under Ontario’s Condominium Act, condo boards must perform reserve fund studies to ensure the corporation has the money to pay for needed maintenance to a building’s common elements.
When the funds are short, the board can issue legally binding special assessments that owners must pay. Failure to pay can result in a condo board taking back a unit and reselling it. Residents say Sandyford Place’s most recent reserve fund study suggests the corporation needs to raise close to $3-million.
“In principal, I completely approve of selling the building,” said Philip Gardner, a reverend with West Plains United Church. “It’s not that I don’t love the place … the building has aged and we’ve ended up financially on the hook for it. There’s coping with the $20,000 variety [of special assessments], which I’ve had to do twice in three years, but what happens when a special assessment is catastrophic? Selling the building to some agency with deeper pockets seemed to be the only way out. My personal bill was $280,000 … there’s no way I can borrow that.”
The process the board is contemplating is found in section 124 of the Condominium Act. It allows for a corporation to dissolve itself and distribute the proceeds of a sale of all the units and the land the building sits on. This procedure has only been used once before in Ontario, in 2017.
The first step is to find a buyer.
In November, the board listed the entire building for sale for $4,999,999, and according to Ms. Forrester it was conditionally sold, but negotiations on price and other issues are currently ongoing. Section 124 requires that 80 per cent of owners and lenders in a building agree to the terms of the sale. And the process differs in other ways from a typical real estate transaction. For instance, “on closing, there’s no discharge of the mortgages – they are just wiped off title,” said Greg Marley, a real estate lawyer who worked on the sale of 39 Roehampton Ave. in Toronto, a 27-unit condo and the province’s only prior Section 124 transaction. “There was no process in place to address it. We gave comfort letters to each of the banks letting them know the loans would be repaid. A couple had some issues and we had to walk them through the process.”
Mr. Gardner bought his unit in 1999, making him the longest-tenured resident after Joan MacDonald, who has been in the building since 1989. Ms. MacDonald, formerly the condo board’s president, has brought a number of legal actions against the condo board in recent years and is currently embroiled in litigation with the corporation. In 2017, the corporation filed a lien for $12,529 against the title of her townhouse in relation to a previous special assessment (she repaid and discharged that lien).
The current condo board president is Sam Nash, a partner in Hamilton’s George Street Law LLC, and head of its commercial litigation group. Mr. Nash, who bought his townhouse in 2014, was unavailable for comment. Chris Kernjeta (who purchased his unit in 2014), is also on the condo board, but didn’t respond to attempts to contact him. Anna Procwat, who with her husband, Eugene Miner, owns two townhouses (one purchased in 2003 and the other for well-below market price in 2018) in the complex and was recently added to the condo board, declined to comment when reached. Ms. Procwat’s brother, Alex, also owns a unit in the building, purchased in 2008. Donna Bacher, a local realtor, believes the individual condos could fetch as much as $750,000 on the market and she has heard from some residents who worry any offer might not reflect fair value.
“I can see this is a very vulnerable group of people; they don’t live extravagant lives,” Ms. Bacher said. Some of the units in the complex are 2,000 square feet in size.
In a tightening downtown Hamilton market, people might be taking on new debt in retirement or near-retirement to move into a condo apartment half that size in a new building such as the nearby Connaught on King Street.
Greg Evans, a broker with Behar Group Realty Inc. who worked on the Roehampton deal, has consulted on a number of Section 124 attempts since 2017, but none have come to fruition. He predicts that more will happen, particularly to smaller condo buildings on land with great development potential and where it’s not as difficult to wrangle all the parties. The trickiest part, he said, is managing expectations.
“I think there’s an immediate response from the owners: They think it’s a lottery ticket. … This land is worth a fortune because they are going to build a condo here and they don’t know the timelines and economics and the risks involved from the development side,” Mr. Evans said.
“[In Roehampton] we were able to educate the owners and manage their expectations, while at the same time give them the confidence they weren’t being taken advantage of by the big bad development community.”
In the case of Sandyford Place, the motivation to sell seems to be the stick of a special assessment more than the carrot of a developer’s offer. But Mr. Marley suggests there is a third way: “Loans are an option: The act requires if you’re going to borrow any money [as a corporation] you have to pass a by-law.” Paying off the loan would raise the condo’s fees, but it might not require an enormous special assessment. Sandyford’s condo board has yet to present any finalized purchase offers to its membership for a vote.

Full text: A Turkish airliner skidded off a runway, crashed into a ditch and broke apart while landing in bad weather in Istanbul Wednesday, killing three people and injuring dozens more.
Passengers had to scramble through the split fuselage to escape.
The aircraft, operated by low-cost carrier Pegasus Airlines, was arriving at Istanbul's Sabiha Gokcen airport from the western Turkish city of Izmir with 183 passengers and crew on board when it had what the Transportation Ministry described as a "rough landing."
Istanbul Governor Ali Yerlikaya said the plane failed to "hold onto the runway" and skidded some 50 to 60 metres before it dropped into the ditch from a height of about 30 metres.
"We are deeply saddened. ... [But] we are very happy that we escaped a greater accident," Mr. Yerlikaya said, adding that the plane could have burst into flames.
Health Minister Fahrettin Koca reported early Thursday that three people had died and 179 required care at multiple hospitals.
Emergency workers, assisted by an excavator, recovered one body from beneath the wreckage before the rescue mission ended.
The airport was shut down after the incident, which occurred at around 6:30 p.m. local time, and flights were diverted to Istanbul's main airport.
Survivor Dogus Bilgic, 24, told Turkish television channel NTV that he fled the smashed plane by way of a gap near his seat and was one of the first passengers to get out.
"We travelled [on the runway] for some 20 or 30 seconds, then all of a sudden we flew off the runway," he said while seated in a wheelchair because of a leg injury. "It happened in seconds."
"I was seated in 25C. I believe the plane broke apart at row 26," Mr. Bilgic recalled, adding that he threw himself out of the plane when he saw the opening.
"The front [of the plane] was in a terrible state. I saw, after I was on the ground, that it had completely broken apart," he said.
As other passengers emerged from the wreckage, Mr. Bilgic said he helped two or three to the ground.
"I carried them somewhere because they weren't doing as well as us," he said, then ran away from the plane with others, fearing a possible explosion.
"There was complete chaos," he said.
Video obtained by the Associated Press showed the wreckage of the plane in a field adjacent to the end of the runway.
The video shows heavy rain and strong winds at the time, with smoke coming from one of the engines as passengers climb out of the fuselage onto the wings of the plane and away from the crash site.
Eyewitness Hasan Eraydin, who shot the video, said he had been driving home from work when he heard a rumble.
"We were about 30 metres away we tried to get to the scene to help, but there was some sort of a canal in between and it was impossible. We thought ‘God willing, no one has died.' " Dozens of rescue crew members swarmed around the floodlit fuselage, including around the cockpit, which had flipped over. The plane was a Boeing 737 that was 11 years old, according to the flight-tracking website Flightradar24.
"We continue to receive reports out of Istanbul, Turkey, regarding the accident involving Pegasus Airlines," Boeing said in a statement. "Our top concern right now is for the safety and well-being of the passengers and crew onboard. We are in contact with our airline customer and have offered them our support. We stand ready to assist in any way possible."
NTV said the injured included the plane's two pilots, who it said were in serious condition. The television channel broadcast a recording of the communications between the pilots and air traffic control in which the pilots are told that previous flights had reported strong tail winds.
"According to the information we have, there was a rough landing. The accident occurred after [the plane] could not decelerate and rammed into a field from the end of the runway," Turkey's state-run Anadolu news agency quoted Transportation and Infrastructure Minister Mehmet Cahit Turan as saying.
Prosecutors opened an investigation of the accident, Anadolu reported.
Pegasus is a privately owned, low-cost carrier based in Istanbul that flies 97 routes, mostly within Turkey and to destinations in Europe, the Middle East and Central Asia. It is majority owned by Turkish billionaire Sevket Sabanci and his family, who have big investments in the country in areas as varied as real estate, clothing, health clubs and packaging materials. The accident comes a month after a Pegasus plane with 164 people on board skidded off the runway at the same airport in Istanbul. There were no deaths or injuries in that incident on Jan. 7.
In January, 2018, another Boeing 737 in the Pegasus fleet slid off a runway at northeastern Turkey's Trabzon Airport and down a dirt embankment. The plane came to rest in the dirt above the Black Sea with its nose pointed toward the water. None of the 168 passengers and crew members were injured.
Planes are designed to absorb impact forces in the bottom of the fuselage to improve the chances that passengers in the cabin above will survive.
In 2013, the tail of an Asiana Airlines Boeing 777 broke off after the jet hit a seawall during approach to San Francisco International Airport. Three people died, 49 were seriously injured and scores more suffered minor injuries, according to the U.S. accident report.
That same year, a Lion Air Boeing 737 split in two after landing in shallow water short of the runway in Bali, Indonesia. All 101 passengers and seven crew members survived.

Islanders playing protective role for Harry and Meghan: Since the Sussexes arrived in December, British Columbians have been happy to give the royals space and shield them from the press

Full text: As far as landing pads go, North Saanich seems at first glance an unlikely choice for Prince Harry and Meghan.
But maybe it’s not. Fruit stands and the odd, errant sheep dot the winding country roads surrounding their rented estate. It’s not unusual to see horses trotting down the middle of the single-lane road fronting the $14-million home on Patricia Bay.
The locals, with their gumboots, walking sticks and wet Labradors, really put the British in British Columbia. Harry must feel right at home. The nearby deli carries curry pies, Cornish pasties and Scottish crisps. Sea Cider, a local cider house, offers decent scrumpy. Saanichton butcher Fraser Orr is said to be “the best haggis maker on this side of the Atlantic.” Every afternoon, the Fairmont Empress Hotel in nearby Victoria serves an elaborate high tea. There’s an island youth cricket league with 15 teams.
Ever since Harry and Meghan, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, decamped for Vancouver Island with their son, Archie, late last year as a prelude to stepping down from their royal duties, British Columbians have been reacting with bemusement over the bit role the island has been playing in the psychodrama roiling England.
E News reports that the couple is considering a relocation to Los Angeles for the summer, but while they remain on Vancouver Island, the young family’s mostly septuagenarian neighbours on “the peninsula,” as the Saanich Peninsula is locally known, are feeling deeply protective of them.
“We just want them to be left alone,” said one woman, who asked not to be named for fear of being mobbed by British press.
She feels “sick” whenever she sees a boat on the inlet, she added, worried that a paparazzo is training a long lens at the young family.
She needn’t worry. Many of the island’s boat operators are refusing to take photographers to the waters surrounding the estate.
“I take people out to take pictures of eagles, whales and seals – things people should be looking at,” said Reg Kirkham, who owns Island Water Taxi. “I don’t go peeping in windows.” Mr. Kirkham said he has refused multiple offers from paparazzi. “We all put our pants on one leg at a time.
They’re humans, too.”
The nearest café, where Harry has stopped for sandwiches and coffee, has posted a sign reading “No press zone” to its front door, making its allegiance clear. “They keep coming and coming,” the woman working the till said of the paparazzi, rolling her eyes. “They don’t seem to understand the meaning of the word ‘no.’” One of their neighbours has formed a Facebook group, where members can identify locations of paparazzi, when they spot them, to help the couple’s security team.
Others are delighting in toying with visiting British press. When reporters stopped the royals’ 83year-old neighbour to ask if he had seen “them,” he stonewalled: “Who?” He then stared blankly back at the journalists. “Oh, right, them – yeah, Archie’s been keeping us up all night with his wailing.”
After Meghan and her eightmonth-old son were photographed from behind bushes in Horth Hill Regional Park last week, a young father bawled out the American paparazzo who took the pictures, a confrontation caught by CHEK, a local TV station. “I spent the last 11 days in the community,” photographer Derek Shook said in defending himself. “Do you think a guy like you does anything for this community?” the local replied.
Meghan and Harry are not unaware of the locals’ mother-hen instincts. Miles Arsenault, who runs a taxi boat from nearby Deep Cove, said he received a phone call from Meghan herself – whom he described as “sweet, real and sincere” – after it was reported that he’d refused to take Japanese photographers to shoot their home abutting the Tseycum First Nation.
(Tseycum leadership have taken the opportunity to note that the stunning, four-acre headland where the estate lies was stolen from their ancestors, who were crowded onto a reserve totalling less than one square kilometre.
Harry and Meghan, on their way to Victoria, likely drive through it.
They might notice that the busy roadway, which was built without consent on Tseycum burial grounds, bisects the reserve, cutting off access to the ocean.)
Islanders are also getting a taste of the “fact-checking” that goes into royal coverage from abroad. More than a month into Meghan and Harry’s Canadian sojourn, Vancouver is still being confused with Vancouver Island, which has been described as a “largely uninhabited” resort island, with “few highways.”
The Canadian news media has been considerably different, in keeping with its own traditions.
Victoria’s Times Colonist, the biggest newspaper on the island of 800,000, declined to report on their presence until after they returned to London briefly early in the new year: “Their connection to our island is worthy of note,” editor and publisher David Obee wrote in an editorial, “but their day-to-day existence here is not.
Let them be.”
When it comes to writing about the private lives of politicians, hockey players and movie stars, Canadian news media have set an unusually high bar. Unless a public interest case can be made, extramarital affairs and step siblings tend to be out of bounds.
This makes Canadian outlets unlikely to dispatch photographers to haunt the bushes outside Meghan and Harry’s home, or publish anything Meghan’s family, the Markles, have to say.
It’s all very Canadian, not that the locals surrounding the peninsula’s royal guests are apologetic.
“I deal with millionaires and billionaires all the time,” said Mr. Kirkham, the water taxi operator who has taken several other celebrities to private islands in the Strait of Georgia. “We just respect it. They’re safe here.”

Q Management seeks cash for property fund: Riding high after recent Toronto-area rental unit sell-off to Starlight, private equity firm aims to raise $500-million

Full text: Following its billion-dollar sale of 44 rental apartment buildings in the Greater Toronto Area, private equity firm Q Management LP is fundraising for a $500-million war chest to do it all over again.
In November, Q sold a collection of rental apartments, known as Continuum Residential REIT, to Toronto-based Starlight Investments for $1.7-billion, including debt. The sale price translated to a 3.5-per-cent capitalization rate, among the steepest valuations in Canadian commercial real estate history, relative to the properties’ rental income.
Q is now back in the market to raise money for its sixth multifamily property fund, as rental apartments are known in the real estate world, and the proceeds will be used to purchase more rental apartments in the GTA.
Despite the quick turnaround from the recent sale, Q chief executive Dan Argiros said he is encouraged by the speed with which Q was able to invest the $350-million it raised in 2018 for its fifth fund, and by investors’ hunger for rental apartment buildings in Canada – particularly in the GTA.
A mix of extremely low vacancies, strong population growth and muted supply increases have turned these towers into lucrative investments.
Seemingly out of nowhere, Canadian apartment buildings have become one of the hottest asset classes in the world, and institutional and high-net-worth investors who are desperate to find the next great deal are likely to invest through local players such as Q. Recently, private equity giant Blackstone has partnered with Starlight to invest in two portfolios of rental properties in Canada.
“There is a strong desire to be in this segment of the real estate market because there’s real growth,” Mr. Argiros said.
Driving this growth is the potential for rent increases as tenants turn over, because rental supply across the country, and particularly in the Greater Toronto Area, is extremely tight. Hardly any apartment buildings have been built since the 1970s, and that’s pushed vacancy rates to 1.1 per cent in Toronto. Across the 44 Continuum buildings, the average vacancy rate was just 0.3 per cent.
A number of publicly traded real estate investment trusts (REITs) also invest in multifamily properties, and across their portfolios there are examples of rents jumping 25 per cent to 30 per cent when there is tenant turnover.
Q has raised money for multifamily funds for roughly two decades, but its bet on the GTA, particularly on properties close to the GO commuter trains that travel into Toronto, has paid off lately because people are flooding into the region.
“Population growth is the single most important factor in the long-term value of real estate,” Mr. Argiros said.
Toronto isn’t alone. The federal government is welcoming newcomers to help fuel economic growth and other cities such as Montreal and Vancouver have become hot spots for global tech talent.
But the problem is particularly acute in Canada’s largest city. In 2018, Toronto’s population jumped by 125,298 people, but new completions of all housing types rose by 37,750 units.
A similar housing shortage, particularly for rentals, is becoming more common across the Western world, prompting some backlash. In 2019, the United Nations’ housing adviser called out private investors for turning rental properties into commodities, creating the potential for tenants to get squeezed – particularly in the United States.
Starlight, the company to which Q recently sold its large apartment portfolio, just raised $216-million to deploy into rental properties in the United States, telling investors there is the potential for “significant increases in rental rates” by making minor fixes to the properties and then hiking rents.
Q’s Mr. Argiros said that while his firm is not building new rental supply, which would help to alleviate the current vacancy crunch, many of the properties Q purchases “have been undermanaged and undercapitalized.”
When Q purchases a property, he added, “we invest in the building.”

Despite boom times, Montreal is plagued by empty storefronts: City searches for answers and solutions, with fingers pointing at everything from greedy landlords to high municipal taxes to changing consumer habits

Full text: On the corner of Montreal’s historic Saint-Laurent Boulevard and trendy Saint-Viateur Street – known for the 24-hour St-Viateur Bagel Shop – lies an empty storefront that has become a symbol of the city’s retail woes.
And Danny Lavy, co-owner of the company that owns the building, has joined a list of real estate players fingered as neighbourhood villains in various pockets of the city.
Mr. Lavy and other landlords are accused by local residents, city politicians and small-business owners of being major contributors to the wave of vacant storefronts plaguing such storied Montreal arteries as Saint Denis Street, Sainte Catherine Street and Park Aveue.
The city last month began holding public consultations to gather suggestions on what to do about the estimated 15 per cent of street-level retail space that sits empty despite a growing population and booming economy.
Those who appeared before the committee cited city taxes, lack of parking and changing consumer habits to explain the problem.
But many also expressed frustration with what they called avaricious landlords, who they say are snapping up buildings in popular neighbourhoods, forcing out long-standing tenants with rent hikes and then letting the storefronts sit empty.
Mr. Lavy says anyone who believes that doesn’t understand basic economics and the realities of running a business in Montreal.
“Are you joking?” he said in a recent interview at the suggestion his company purposefully lets storefronts sit empty.
“We are willing to take … lower and lower rent. You think I’d rather pay my mortgage and city taxes and be empty?” Buildings on popular streets such as Saint-Viateur are worth a fortune, he said, adding that former owners on the strip were more than happy to sell to him.
When you factor in new mortgage payments, city taxes and renovation costs, landlords need to find tenants who can pay prices that reflect the market’s new value.
The empty store at the corner of Saint-Laurent and Saint-Viateur used to house a café and music venue selling a meatless menu to a mostly young and bohemian clientele. But Coop Le Cagibi was forced out in 2018 when the previous landlord jacked up the rent.
The space has been empty since.
City councillor Richard Ryan is running the consultations and says the city doesn’t have the data to quantify the role real estate speculators and wealthy landlords are playing in the vacancy problem.
But Mr. Ryan, who represents the Mile End district where Le Cagibi was located, said there is “no reason” a renter can’t be found to replace it.
Roughly 14,000 workers around the neighbourhood shop and eat on Saint-Viateur daily, Mr. Ryan said in a recent interview.
Mile End is also one of the most densely populated parts of the city. Saint-Viateur, he said, “has all the elements.”
Mark Lazar, a real estate developer with mixed-use properties across the city, said it’s easy to blame so-called greedy landlords for vacancies, but a deeper reflection on the matter reveals other causes.
A lot of vacancies on commercial arteries are big spaces that don’t respond to the current needs of the market, Mr. Lazar said in an interview.
Fifteen years ago, many of these spaces were filled with spacious restaurants feeding large crowds, he said, but today “entrepreneurial young chefs” are opting for cozier spaces.
Additionally, landlords have to pay hefty upfront costs to renovate before tenants move in. “Today, the cost of [having] a tenant is not well understood,” Mr. Lazar said. “They think any tenant can walk in like they walk into an apartment that is already furnished.”
A business owner on Sainte Catherine Street, who didn’t want to be named because she is in litigation with her landlord, said in an interview she had tried in vain a couple of years ago to negotiate an affordable rent for several unoccupied retail spaces on the street.
But at least four times, she said, the various real estate agents didn’t want to negotiate because the owners allegedly didn’t care whether it was rented or not. Even empty, the buildings were “just gaining value,” she was told.
But Mr. Lazar and Mr. Lavy say the main factor behind the vacancies is taxes.
Global real estate consultant firm, Altus Group, calculates that Montreal has the highest commercial real estate taxes among large Canadian cities.
Montreal taxes, Mr. Lavy said, “are completely out of whack for a retail operation. Retail is already destroyed because of the internet.”
Mr. Ryan said he’s heard from fiscal experts that big landlords can write off losses associated with empty properties to reduce taxes on revenues from other buildings in their portfolio. Alternatively, he said, the big players have the financial cushion to let the space sit empty and wait until a major chain comes knocking with the means to pay the high rent.
Ron Rayside, with architecture firm Rayside Labossiere, filed a submission to Mr. Ryan’s committee, in which he suggested the city impose a tax on owners who let their storefronts sit empty for long periods of time, with the levy increasing the longer it is left empty.
A commercial artery is the heart of a neighbourhood, he said in a recent interview, and there is growing concern that too many are being allowed to wither. “It’s where people walk around, where there is life, where you can meet people,” he said.
Mr. Lavy said he had good news for those worried about Saint-Viateur: He found a business to replace Coop Le Cagibi. “I’m putting a lot of money into it. It’s going to be open by the summer,” he said.
“I can tell you every place I have on Saint-Viateur will be open by the summer. And I happen to love Saint-Viateur. Not like – love.”

Full text: This was supposed to be easy.
Luc Desjardins, chief executive at Superior Plus Corp., announced plans last June to sell the propane distributor’s chemicals business, a profitable but low-growth remnant of a previous CEO’s strategy. Mr. Desjardins had every reason to expect a bidding war for the division, which sells products to everyone from pulp and paper producers to airports that need to de-ice planes. The expectation among analysts was rival chemical companies would face off against the seemingly limitless wallets of private equity funds.
PE funds, after all, are flush with somewhere in the neighbourhood of $2.5-trillion, and fund managers only earn fees on this capital – known as dry powder – if they put it to work. Mr. Desjardins was only looking for about $900-million of that historically unprecedented pile of cash.
A chemical producer with dependable customers is the type of business that sets hearts aflutter in the PE community, especially since banks are willing to lend at low rates to the companies targeted by the PE buyers, turbocharging potential returns for funds as they leverage their investments with additional debt.
Yet no buyer stepped up. In the latest of a series of proposed corporate auctions that ended without a sale, Toronto-based Superior Plus shut down the auction on Tuesday. “The sales process attracted considerable interest for specialty chemicals,” Mr. Desjardins said in a release. “The final bids, however, did not meet our expectations.”
The consistent message from private equity fund managers, some of the savviest and wealthiest investors around, is that sellers are asking too dear a price for their businesses these days. As North American stock markets continue to hit record highs, notwithstanding Friday’s setback, the PE crowd is signalling they see valuations getting frothy. Fund managers are willing to sit on record amounts of capital, even if that hurts short-term performance, rather than commit money to businesses they judge as overpriced.
“There is concern on valuations across the private equity industry, and that means some sales processes at corporations are going to fail,” said Brian Hanson, chief executive of the Canadian branch of investment bank Lazard Ltd. However, Mr. Hanson said over all, the strength of the economy and dynamics of capital markets mean “you will still see plenty of transactions get done.”
Private equity activity in Canada peaked in early 2017, according to data from the Canadian Venture Capital & Private Equity Association, or CVCA. In the second quarter of 2017, funds invested $8.8-billion on 178 transactions.
Since then, deal-making has slowed, with fewer buyouts getting done and less capital being put to work. In the third quarter of 2019, the most recent period tracked by the CVCA, funds put $1.8-billion to work in 94 deals.
Both figures represented fiveyear lows.
The slowdown in private equity-based takeovers means Mr. Desjardins has plenty of company in the failed corporate auction club. Renewable energy producer Northland Power Inc. put itself up for sale two years ago, in part to allow its founder to cash out, but failed to attract an acceptable offer from bidders that included PE funds. Northland’s founder, James Temerty, opted instead to exit by selling $750-million of shares on public markets. Shaw Communications Inc. tried to find a private equity buyer last year for its stake in Corus Entertainment Inc., but also ended up selling its Corus shares for $548million to public investors.
Theatre chain Cineplex Inc. is taking an unprecedented step to entice a Canadian private equity buyer, such as a deep-pocketed pension fund, into topping a $2.2billion friendly takeover bid from Britain’s Cineworld Group Inc.
that was unveiled in December.
Toronto-based Cineplex persuaded the buyer to agree to a discounted “break fee” of $27.7-million that would be paid to Cineworld if its offer is topped by a Canadian bidder. If a non-Canadian bidder makes a better offer, however, the break fee doubles to $55.4-million. Cineplex hoped that slashing the fee for Canadians would make a deal more appealing for a local bidder.
“Cineplex is a proudly Canadian company and our board wanted to use the lower break fee as a way to encourage a Canadian company to come forward,” Ellis Jacob, president and CEO of Cineplex, said in an e-mail to The Globe and Mail.
Despite the enticement, and strong performance from another European theatre chain owned by the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System and Alberta Investment Management Corp., Cineplex has yet to attract a better bid. The seven-week “go shop” period ends Sunday.
The private equity sector’s current cautious approach has been demonstrated by Onex Corp., a pioneering PE company that is sitting on US$6.7-billion of committed capital. Onex executives openly admit they are struggling to find a place to put that cash to work.
In a recent conference call, senior managing director Robert Le Blanc said: “It continues to be a challenging investment environment. Competition is intense, interest rates are low, credit is readily available and valuations are high.”
Private equity firms such as Onex are buying fixer-uppers, as witnessed by the Toronto-based company’s $3.5-billion acquisition of WestJet Airlines Ltd. last year. The bid came after airline stumbled on its expansion into international flights, posting weaker-than-expected results that sent the stock price down by 37 per cent and opened the door to a friendly takeover.
Real estate is the one sector that seems immune to a slowdown in PE activity, with takeovers continuing to play out against a backdrop of investor demand for alternative assets and customer demand for office and residential space. Data from investment bank Crosbie & Co.
show property company transactions are continuing at a brisk clip, including September’s $6.2billion purchase of Torontobased Dream Real Estate Investment Trust by New York private equity giant Blackstone Group.
Experts say companies of all descriptions, including PE funds and strategic buyers, are becoming more cautious around acquisitions, mainly on concerns that an economic slowdown in inevitable. Sam Sivarajan, managing director at Crosbie & Co., said Canadian merger activity softened in the third quarter of 2019 “following an extended period” of strong deal activity.
Where does that leave Mr. Desjardins at Superior Plus? If the CEO is patient, analysts say he’ll eventually find a buyer.
“We continue to believe it makes strategic sense to divest the specialty chemical business, and think that the company could look to divest the business when the environment is more favourable,” Nelson Ng at RBC Dominion Securities Inc. said in a report last week, and he cited some history to back his argument.
“Superior Plus ran a sales process for its construction products distribution business in 2014, decided to retain and improve the business, and subsequently divested the business in 2016 for US$325-million,” Mr. Ng said.
These deals are just never as easy as a CEO expects.

Full text: Kevin Ford’s company doesn’t make iPhones, goose-down parkas or jet airplanes—products that are easy for investors to understand and for analysts to value. Calian Group supplies specialized systems, training and software to several sectors, ranging from the military to health care. The firm also builds satellite equipment at a factory in Saskatoon, selling its wares across North America and Europe.
Calian’s stock has traded at a modest 15 times trailing earnings recently. “I think we got a bit of a discount because of our diversity,” concedes the 55-year-old bespectacled tech industry veteran. “At some point, fundamentals will be sexy again, and I’ll be one of the top 10 sexiest CEOs.”
Amid the hottest stock run in history, there are still solid, unglamorous performers that somehow get overlooked by most investors.
Several of these companies share traits. Some are conceptually challenging, or have specialties that look risky or bewildering at first glance, such as subprime lending or making internet protocol equipment and software for broadcasters. Others produce reliable profits and share-price appreciation in humdrum but essential businesses like rental housing, iron ore mining and managing local hockey arenas.
After a 10-year bull market that’s looking long overdue for a correction, dogged value investors are searching for bargains that might provide safety in a storm. And companies like Ford’s are hidden gems ready to be found, priced well below the traditional value investor’s price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio threshold of 20. Finding them takes work, however.
To discover how the leaders of these companies have improved on traditional strategies, we searched beyond the financial statements. We called 10 of them to find out what their organizations actually do—and all were eager to tell their stories.
CALIAN GROUP LTD.
REVENUE: $343 MILLION PROFIT: $20 MILLION THREE-YEAR PRICE GAIN: 51% P/E RATIO (TRAILING): 15.3 Calian CEO Kevin Ford doesn’t have a spectacular idea to sell to investors.
Unlike other Canadian tech companies that grew far bigger—Nortel and BlackBerry come to mind—his firm’s business is unlikely to grab headlines. But given those firms’ gargantuan flameouts, his approach might be wise.
What Ford’s company has are four segments, each a challenge to explain: Advanced Technologies, which makes
satellite components and ground systems, primarily in Saskatoon (its clients include the European Space Agency and Sirius XM); Health, which runs clinics for the Department of National Defence (DND) and Loblaw; Learning, which provides training programs and software to the DND and other public sector clients; and Information Technology, a grab bag of consulting services for enterprise systems and cloudbased computing.
Everyone got that? Ford tries an analogy: Calian is an engine with four pistons, “and even if one goes down, I still have three driving the company.” Founded in 1982, Calian has grown steadily and posted prof its for 72 straight quarters, going back to 2001.
And the company keeps investing substantially in R&D for its future—about $10 million since Ford took the helm as CEO in 2015.
Still, Calian’s stock market value has barely exceeded the top threshold for a small-cap stock recently—about $300 million. That can be frustrating. “We see people coming to IPO right now and blowing through our market cap in a couple of days,” Ford says. “We don’t do simple things. We do complex things, and we do them very well.”
GENWORTH MI CANADA INC.
REVENUE: $680 MILLION PROFIT: $452 MILLION THREE-YEAR PRICE GAIN: 69% P/E RATIO (TRAILING): 12.7 Canadian regulators have been so worried about a meltdown in the red-hot housing markets of Toronto and Vancouver that they’ve created one of the most profitable mortgage insurance sectors on the planet.
The tightening regulations have “made our business a lot less risky,” says Stuart Levings, CEO of Genworth MI Canada. The two biggest moves over the past decade were hiking the amount of capital that must be held by mortgage insurers and introducing a stress test for homebuyers in 2016, which gauges whether buyers could afford their payments under higher interest rates.
The test cut Genworth’s market by 20%, Levings estimates. But continued economic expansion, plus low and stable interest rates, have helped it resume its growth, he says. So has strong immigration.
Another very good thing for Genworth MI Canada is that mortgage insurance is not a competitive business.
“It’s an oligopoly, right?” says Levings, a straight-talking accountant who’s been with the company since 2000 and was promoted to CEO in 2015.
The federally owned Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. has about half of the market, Genworth Canada has about one-third, and the remaining 15% or so is held by Canada Guaranty Mortgage Insurance Co. “None of us wants anyone to get reckless,” Levings says.
The companies compete on service and relationships with lenders, not price.
This past year, Genworth MI Canada removed uncertainty about its ownership. In 2016, a Chinese company agreed to buy U.S.-based Genworth Financial Inc., which owned 57% of Genworth Canada. But Ottawa declined to approve the change in ownership. Last August, the private equity arm of Brookfield Asset Management purchased the share instead.
The company’s share price has climbed about 15% since the Brookfield deal was announced, but Levings thinks the stock is still a bargain.
“There’s absolutely more value to be had,” he says.
GOEASY LTD.
REVENUE: $506 MILLION PROFIT: $53 MILLION THREE-YEAR PRICE GAIN: 198% P/E RATIO (TRAILING): 15.3 Does a consumer lending company with the word “easy” in its name sound like a risky investment? How about one that boasts “We say YES more than anyone else” on its website?
Jason Mullins, who’s been the CEO of Goeasy, based in Mississauga, since 2010, will disabuse any misconceptions.
He has plenty of data showing his busi-
ness is neither shaky nor niche. About a third of all Canadian adults are belowprime borrowers, meaning banks consider them lending risks. Many had a “credit shock” in the past, due to an event like a job loss or divorce. Yet they still have to meet pressing financial needs, from auto or home repairs to kids’ summer camps.
Goeasy has more than 400 locations across Canada and grants mostly unsecured instalment loans of up to $35,000, for terms from nine months to 10 years.
They aren’t cheap—annual interest rates range from 19.9% to 46.9%.
But Mullins argues Goeasy’s loans are far better for borrowers than getting “trapped in a cycle of interest-only payments” on credit cards, or payday loans, which often lead to repeated borrowing at crushing rates. Instalments also help customers rebuild credit scores.
To limit risk, the company only approves about one loan applicant in seven. And by income and other demographic measures, Mullins says, “the typical customer looks identical to the average everyday working-class Canadian.” As a result, the percentage of loans that Goeasy writes off as unpaid is a manageable 13%, and has been remarkably stable in good times and bad.
Goeasy’s expansion has also been steady. Revenue has climbed from $66 million in 2001 to $506 million in 2018.
Total shareholder return over that time is 6,559%. Yet Mullins believes there is still plenty of room for the company to grow and that the stock is “cheap relative to its potential.” TRICON CAPITAL GROUP INC.
REVENUE: US$400.5 MILLION PROFIT: US$216.8 MILLION THREE-YEAR PRICE GAIN: 9% P/E RATIO (TRAILING) 13.3 When veteran Toronto real estate executive and Tricon co-founder David Berman and his son Gary saw a 50% to 70% plunge in house prices in the U.S. Sunbelt during the 2009 financial crisis, they started buying in the region as fast as possible. “It’s been an amazing ride,” says Gary, 45, who succeeded his father as CEO in 2015.
Tricon raised $69 million in an IPO in 2010. From 2009 to 2012, it bought close to US$1 billion in property. The company purchased bargain-priced land to start and then partnered with local investors to buy houses for rental purposes. It bought many in foreclosure auctions held on courthouse steps. The buyers paid with knapsacks full of cashier’s cheques.
Tricon now manages about US$8 billion worth of its own houses and apartments, and approximately US$2 billion for other investors. Roughly 90% of its holdings are in the fast-growing Sunbelt, and Berman says U.S. rental demand is huge—a US$4-trillion market.
The company has even automated the housebuying process. Computers scan MLS listings every 10 minutes, run new postings through 90 criteria and can file an offer within five minutes.
At that point, an underwriter will visit. Tricon buys about 800 houses every quarter this way.
As the firm hit its stride from 2012 to 2015, its share price tripled, but has since bumped along sideways. Tricon’s business isn’t easy to dissect—even for real estate investors. It’s not a REIT, and it has few marquee properties; the Selby rental tower in Toronto, opened in 2018, is probably the only one that’s recognizable. “The stock price is frustrating, but also incredibly motivating,” Berman says. “We’re, in a sense, trading at our book value, but not getting any value for the management company. Or for growth.”
Berman says expansion is inevitable: “I think we’re still in the early days of what Tricon is going to become.”
ROYAL CANADIAN MINT GOLD ETR REVENUE: N/A PROFIT: N/A THREE-YEAR PRICE GAIN: 28% P/E RATIO (TRAILING): N/A Gold bullion has been a store of wealth for millennia. And buying from a government mint seems like an obvious way to acquire it. Yet the Royal Canadian Mint, which stores and refines the precious metal—and sells a wide range of collectibles—was slow to see the opportunity in serving investors.
But in 2011, the Mint introduced bullion exchange-traded receipts (ETRs), which allow the purchase of bullion that is then stored in its vaults.
Norman Toye, the president of the Mint’s ETR program, says timing was a big factor. Bullion prices soared to an all-time high of close to US$1,900 an ounce that year, but there were just a handful of large North American bullion exchange-traded funds, including the giant SPDR Gold Trust, based in New York, and the half-century-old Central Fund of Canada. The price surge stoked investor interest, and the Mint raised $600 million in an IPO of its ETRs. “We kind of timed it to the top of the market,” says Toye.
But bullion prices then sank and drifted sideways, before starting to rise again in 2018. Bullion ETFs have outperformed many gold stocks, and the Mint’s ETRs have beaten its rivals’ recently, including the Sprott Physical Gold and Silver Trust (which bought the Central Fund in 2018) and the iShares Gold Bullion ETF.
There’s also a technical difference: The Mint’s ETRs give buyers titles to bullion, while competing funds’ units are shares of an entity that holds bullion. That said, you need to hold at least 10,000 ETRs from the Mint to cash them in for gold. Toye says only a few investors have done that to “kick the tires.”
In a way, though, the restriction adds cachet. The gold is locked in Canada’s equivalent of Fort Knox: the Mint’s castle-like 1908 headquarters on Sussex Drive in Ottawa.
CHAMPION IRON LTD.
REVENUE: $655.1 MILLION PROFIT: $147.6 MILLION THREE-YEAR PRICE GAIN: 435% P/E RATIO (TRAILING): 18.1 Talk about a buying opportunity. In December 2015, Montreal-based Champion Iron, chaired by savvy industry veteran Michael O’Keefe, agreed to purchase the huge Bloom Lake iron ore mine in northeastern Quebec. The deal pulled the property out of bankruptcy protection for just $10.3 million in cash plus the assumption of $42.8 million in liabilities (mostly environmental).
For that bargain price, Champion got a mine in which two U.S. giants had invested US$3.6 billion since 2009 to prepare for production, as well as a railway line to a new all-seasons export terminal on the Gulf of St. Lawrence.
Even so, Bloom Lake was no sure thing. The global price of ore had slid from a peak of almost US$190 a tonne in 2011 to a low of US$40 a tonne that December.
But the timing was near perfect. “I think we missed [the bottom] by a day and a half,” says CEO David Cataford, who was hired in 2014 as a vice-president and promoted to the top job this past April.
Iron prices have steadily climbed to about US$90 a tonne today, and the company has invested another $200 million. The mine began producing in February 2018 and will soon double its capacity to 15 million tonnes a year. Champion has also almost halved production costs to $49.50 per tonne through several improvements, including activating a 3.5-kilometre conveyor belt to transport ore from the mine for processing, rather than trucking it, and introducing a new system to store tailings. The cost reductions have made the company competitive with BHP Billiton, Rio Tinto and other global iron ore giants.
Even better, ore from northern Quebec now commands a premium of about US$10 a tonne over lower-grade product from Australia and Brazil. That’s thanks to China, which consumes about half of all ore and is eager to make its steel cleaner.
EVERTZ TECHNOLOGIES LTD.
REVENUE: $443.6 MILLION PROFIT: $78.5 MILLION THREE-YEAR PRICE GAIN: 5% P/E RATIO TRAILING: 18.3 Six generic-looking buildings in an industrial park in Burlington, Ont., generate the technical dazzle seen in big-time sports telecasts, including the NFL, NHL, Summer Olympics and many more.
Evertz makes equipment and software to edit and transmit images and sound. The company traditionally served broadcasters, but now works with just about any organization that uses audiovisual tools. Chief financial officer Doug Moore tries to describe things simply: If you’re watching a hockey game, there are cameras and microphones at the rink, and live action and replays appear on your screen. “All the stuff in between? That’s kind of what we do,” he says.
The company was founded as Dynaquip Electron Devices Ltd. in 1966 by husband and wife Dieter and Rose Evertz, and it made time-coding and closed-captioning equipment.
In 1997, annual sales were still only about US$2 million. But that year, Romolo Magarelli and Doug DeBruin, young executives with a rival video technology company, bought Evertz.
Their timing was auspicious. The industry was on the cusp of two massive shifts: from standard to high definition, and from traditional broadcasting to Internet delivery. Evertz’s sales soared to US$141 million in 2006, and it went public. Revenue has more than tripled since, and the company has more than 1,600 employees, about 1,300 of them in Burlington. “That’s quite a growth rate,” says Moore.
Yes and no. Other tech plays have grown much faster. And Evertz’s systems are specialized. But analysts are bullish. Here’s a hint from a recent Canaccord Genuity report: Evertz’s revenue tends to peak in Summer Olympic and U.S. presidential election years. “This could be a near-term tailwind for the stock,” the report says.
ALGONQUIN POWER AND UTILITIES CORP.
REVENUE: US$1.6 BILLION PROFIT: US$79.1 MILLION THREE-YEAR PRICE GAIN: 65% P/E RATIO (TRAILING): 18 Why would anyone shut down a “perfectly good coal plant” and replace it with US$1 billion worth of wind farms? Algonquin co-founder and 30-year CEO Ian Robertson asks that question rhetorically. He then quickly substitutes “operational” for “good,” because he doesn’t want to offend the environmental sensibilities of his 12-year-old daughter, Lauren.
This March, Algonquin will shut down a 1971 coal-fired electricity plant in Missouri; it plans to have wind farms in that state and Kansas, with a total capacity of 600 megawatts, in commercial operation by late 2020. The reason is simple: Wind is now cheaper than coal.
The wind farms will produce electricity for about 4 US cents per kilowatt hour to start. Under a production tax credit, new U.S. wind farms get a subsidy of 2.2 US cents a kilowatt hour for their first decade, bringing the price below that for coal power, which is about 3 US cents (the Trump administration has discontinued the credit). And the cost of wind, solar and other renewables is still declining. “Renewable energy has come of age economically,” Robertson, 60, says.
Over the next five years, Algonquin, based in Oakville, Ont., plans to boost the proportion of its power generated from renewable sources to about 75% from just under 40% now.
The company is a hodgepodge of assets. It started in Ontario’s then newly deregulated electricity market by opening a small generating station on a river near Peterborough in 1991.
Algonquin currently owns more than 70 power generation facilities and gas and water utilities in Ontario, New Brunswick and 13 U.S. states. It is still a fraction of the size of industry giants, such as Ontario Power Generation and Hydro-Québec, but it is also more nimble. “There is no way to get electricity any cheaper than through renewables,” Robertson says. “What a great turn of events for our customers and our kids.” CLARKE INC.
REVENUE: $6.9 MILLION LOSS: $600,000 THREE-YEAR SHARE PRICE GAIN: 33% P/E RATIO TRAILING: 7.1 Whether you call George Armoyan a catalyst investor or a raider—or both—he was on quite a roll in the early 2000s.
He accumulated significant interests in almost a dozen mostly beat-up mid-sized companies and then either turned them around or sold out for a quick profit. Shares in Clarke, Armoyan’s principal public company, soared from about $2 to almost $11 in 2007.
Alas, the shares tumbled back down to $2 during the financial crisis. Michael Rapps, who joined as vice-president of investments in 2011 and succeeded Armoyan as CEO in 2014, says Clarke got distracted. It needed to return to its core strategy: “to be an opportunistic investor with a concentrated portfolio focusing on distressed, out-of-favour or turnaround-type investments.”
Clarke has pared down to just five significant holdings today: minority stakes in two energy-related companies, full control of Holloway Lodging Corp. and a ferry service across the St.
Lawrence, and some real estate.
Investors have applauded. Clarke shares have climbed back above $12.
But there are caveats to consider. Much of the price gain has been fuelled by buybacks, which have reduced Clarke’s shares outstanding to about 12 million from 20 million.
Rapps also warns it can take years for any one of the company’s investments to pan out. In the meantime, its shortterm earnings can fluctuate wildly.
Clarke totals the market value of its investments at the end of each quarter, and records any moves up or down—temporary or not.
Rather than earnings, Rapps prefers to focus on Clarke’s tangible book value per share, which has been about $14 recently. The lower market price frustrates him. “We consider our stock cheap,” he says.
And Armoyan remains as 44% owner of Clarke and its executive chairman.
As in the early 2000s, you still gotta believe in his vision.
CANLAN ICE SPORTS CORP.
REVENUE: $87.6 MILLION PROFIT: $4.5 MILLION THREE-YEAR PRICE GAIN: 57% P/E RATIO (TRAILING): 18.5 If you’ve ever tried to book a rink during hockey season, you know the demand is intense. But turning Canada’s national passion into a profitable business has always been a challenge.
In the mid-1990s, what was then Canlan Investment Corp. boasted it was going to consolidate North America’s arena business. The company’s shares soared, further boosted by its extensive Vancouver real estate holdings. But the share price crashed by more than 90%. The Barker family took managerial control, raised its stake in the company (it now owns 75%), refocused Canlan on ice sports, cleared away debt and began a very long rebuilding process.
Current CEO Joey St-Aubin, a star Ontario Junior centre in the late ‘80s and early ‘90s, joined Canlan in 1997 and was promoted to the top job in 2009. Progress since then has been slow. Revenue has grown a bit, and Canlan operates 60 rinks and 20 other surfaces at 21 facilities—about the same total as a decade ago.
But Canlan’s share price has more than tripled, and St-Aubin says behind-the-scenes improvements continue. One is expanding the Adult Safe Hockey League, the largest recreational organization in North America, with 65,000 players. “We play more games in one week than the NHL does in a season,” he says.
Further growth will be tough in Canada, however. Building or buying more arenas in the red-hot Toronto and Vancouver real estate markets is very expensive. And Canlan competes with government-owned—and subsidized—facilities when selling ice time.
But there are promising opportunities in the United States and in other sports, including soccer, volleyball and basketball.
Expanding Canlan’s shareholder base isn’t an urgent priority—in addition to the Barkers, another family controls 17%—but the public float is now so thin, even buying or selling a few hundred shares can whipsaw the stock price. “Obviously, we’d like to be a little more liquid than we are today,” St-Aubin says.

Full text: Sales of new houses more than doubled in the Toronto region last year, and new condo sales rose 27 per cent, with robust activity in the city’s surrounding regions.
About 9,500 new single-family homes sold last year, compared with 3,710 in the previous year, although still below the 10-year average, according to real estate data company Altus Group.
Meanwhile, nearly 27,000 new condos sold last year, compared with 21,145 in the previous year, as a slew of new multifamily projects got off the ground.
Toronto was responsible for the majority of the new condo purchases, with sales of the preconstruction, under construction or newly built units increasing 5 per cent to 14,670.
But north of the city, in York Region, sales doubled. West of the city, in Halton, sales also doubled and in nearby Peel region, sales rose 55 per cent. (Although the number of units was much smaller than Toronto.)
A lack of housing in the country’s most populated city has triggered a wave of new multifamily projects. Dozens of condo developments are in the works, amid sustained demand from investors and residents who need a place to live.
Nearly 32,000 condos are scheduled to be completed this year, according to real estate consultancy Urbanation. That is an unprecedented number of new units with about two-thirds in the city of Toronto and the remaining in the surrounding regions including York.
Local governments and the federal housing agency have been pushing for more dense living arrangements such as condos and duplexes in order to make housing more affordable. Still, demand is high enough that prices have been steadily rising.
The benchmark price, or the average asking price of a new condo minus the lowest and highest values, rose to a record high of $916,585 last year in the Greater Toronto Area, according to the Altus report.
Part of that is driven by investors, said Simeon Papailias, a realtor with Royal LePage Signature Realty who specializes in preconstruction sales: “Regular people are seeking ways to grow their wealth and investments.”
Condos and other types of multifamily units are typically cheaper than a detached house.
But the Altus report shows prices for new single-family homes declined from the peak of the housing boom in 2017, amid a number of new policies aimed at cooling market including the mortgage stress test.
Implemented in 2018, the stricter rules require borrowers to qualify at a rate two percentage points higher than the market rate or the Bank of Canada’s benchmark five-year rate, which is at 5.19 per cent, whichever is higher. That along with three interest-rate increases created uncertainty in the market and sales of new condos and single-family homes declined in 2018.
The stress test “disproportionally impacted single-family homes because of the higher costs,” said David Wilkes, president of the industry group Building Industry and Land Development Association.
The Altus report shows the average prices for houses and condos converging. While the benchmark price for a new condo climbed over the past two years to $916,585, the benchmark price for a new single-family house fell to $1,088,317 over the same period.

Quebec pension giant Caisse picks Charles Émond as CEO: Banking veteran will face pressure to maintain good fund returns produced by his predecessor

Full text: The Quebec government has named former Bank of Nova Scotia investment banker Charles Émond as chief executive of the Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec, putting its faith in a fresh-faced deal maker amid more challenging times ahead.
The appointment of Mr. Émond, 47, was confirmed by the Caisse on Wednesday after a meeting of Quebec Premier François Legault’s cabinet. He replaces Michael Sabia, who is slated to leave at the end of this week after a decade-long tenure.
Canada’s pension funds have performed strongly through this bull market and Mr. Émond will be under pressure to maintain the 9.9-per-cent annual average return Quebeckers have gotten used to from the Caisse under his predecessor despite increasing economic volatility. He has the added provincial government-mandated obligation to promote economic development, something the pension fund has sometimes struggled with over the years.
“The next decade … won’t have the same tailwinds that we’ve benefited from,” Mr. Émond said in an interview Wednesday.
“For a similar level of return, you’ll have to deploy more efforts to actually get there.”
That means adding people who have complementary expertise to the Caisse’s current teams, he said. And it means consolidating its existing international footprint instead of expanding into new countries.
“[Michael Sabia and I] have different personalities, but the values are the same,” Mr. Émond said. “I intend on continuing building from the legacy that Michael has built.”
The Caisse had net assets of $326.7-billion at the end of June, 2019. Roughly twothirds of its geographic exposure is outside Canada.
Mr. Émond beat out other candidates that included Macky Tall, a Caisse veteran who leads the pension fund’s infrastructure investments, and André Bourbonnais, a former CEO of the federal government’s pension fund manager, PSP Investments, who now works for U.S. investment management giant BlackRock Inc.
Mr. Tall was the preferred candidate of the Caisse’s internal selection committee, Montreal’s La Presse newspaper reported, but the Quebec government had the final say.
Asked by reporters Wednesday morning why he chose Mr. Émond, Mr. Legault said all the candidates were “exceptional,” but noted Mr. Émond’s youth, calling him a “brilliant” executive. The Premier has shown a penchant for placing his faith in younger leaders. His cabinet is full of ministers with substantial business and public-service credentials, but hardly any experience running ministries.
“Mr. Émond is a generalist. His experience is global. And that’s key for this organization,” said Michel Nadeau, a former Caisse executive who now works as executive director of the Institute for Governance of Private and Public Organizations.
Bankers who worked closely with Mr. Émond during his tenure at Scotiabank emphasized his capable mind, but also his versatility at working with clients across a range of sectors and asset classes.
He’s said to be decisive and have a strong sense of humour.
Caisse chairman Robert Tessier praised Mr. Émond for his “rich combination” of experience and abilities, saying he has a deep understanding of Quebec’s business community.
“A seasoned negotiator, Charles has demonstrated throughout his career that he can successfully conclude complex and major projects by mobilizing his teams and managing stakeholder relationships with a long-term perspective,” Mr. Tessier said.
Mr. Émond was recruited to the Caisse a year ago after an 18-year career at Scotiabank, where he was a rising star who notably piloted the lender’s global investment banking and Canadian corporate banking businesses. A chartered accountant and business valuator, he steered Scotiabank’s international investment activities on four continents, planting its flag firmly in South America where the bank quickly became one of the main players in corporate finance and mergers and acquisitions.
He made his name running the bank’s Quebec business from Montreal. He then moved to Toronto, where he was named cohead of global investment banking in 2015.
He worked closely on key mergers and acquisitions files, both for clients and for Scotiabank. He was instrumental in Scotiabank’s two-year courtship of investment firm Jarislowsky Fraser Ltd., which the bank acquired in 2018 for $950-million.
“It was done with a very small team. It was basically Charles and I and Mr. Jarislowsky and a couple of his colleagues,” Brian Porter, Scotiabank’s CEO, said in an interview last year.
“He has worked very hard in his career to achieve what he has to date, but his intellect, gravitas and expertise is what makes him rise above,” said Camilla Sutton, CEO of Women in Capital Markets and former global head of foreign exchange at Scotiabank.
At the Caisse, Mr. Émond was initially in charge of the pension fund’s Quebec investment strategy and global strategic planning. But he was given added responsibility for all of its private-equity activities when another senior executive unexpectedly left the organization in November.
The Caisse has a dual mandate of maximizing returns for depositors and promoting Quebec’s economic development, the only Canadian pension fund with such a directive. In practice, that means its CEO needs to have a heightened political sensibility given their actions are scrutinized by the government, the population and the media.
Mr. Sabia, 66, led the Caisse through four changes of government in Quebec City, navigating those politically charged waters by defending the Caisse’s decision-making independence while boosting investments in local companies and real estate. He has always insisted that the best way to protect Quebec companies is by making them world beaters, a philosophy Mr. Émond said he shares.
Mr. Émond will face several immediate challenges on the corporate front. Chief among them: What to do, if anything, to help Bombardier Inc.
The Caisse owns a roughly 30-per-cent stake in Bombardier’s rail business, a US$1.5-billion investment it made in 2016 that “saved the company,” Mr. Sabia has said.
Bombardier is now searching for ways to generate cash to pay down debt, an effort that may include selling the rail business outright.

Former London banker aims to make digital local news a thriving business

Full text: Karl Hancock spent 25 years at the epicentre of London’s financial world, working for Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Berenberg Bank. He’s given that up for an unlikely crusade to revitalize local news and he’s planning on hiring 100 journalists in towns across Britain.
Mr. Hancock has launched Nub News, a hyperlocal media outlet that mixes old-fashioned reporting with computer algorithms to cover every aspect of small-town living from what’s on at the cinema to train schedules, road repairs, real estate listings and the latest council shenanigans. The service has expanded to 26 communities since it launched last year and Mr. Hancock says he’s just getting started. His aim to reach up to 700 towns and small cities with a team of more than 100 reporters.
There’s certainly a gap to fill. Like Canada, Britain has seen a steady drop in the number newspapers and journalists covering small communities. From 2005 to 2018, Britain lost 245 local papers and the downward trend shows no sign of slowing down, according to Press Gazette, which covers the British newspaper industry.
“There is a real demand for local news and that’s never gone away,” Mr. Hancock, 51, said from his home in Devon in southwest England. “The real problem is how does one pay for it and how does one make it work?” He acknowledged that Nub News is a long way from making money but revenue and readership are growing and he’s already had two rounds of financings from eager investors.
The venture is largely the brainchild of Dean Waghorn, a 51-year-old computer programmer who came up with the idea for Nub News after watching the slow decline of his newspaper in Bridgewater, south of Bristol. He decided to fill the vacuum by creating a website and writing short stories based on news releases from town officials and the police. He also developed a program that could aggregate local information from various websites such as National Rail, eBay, and property sellers such as Zoopla and Rightmove. He ran the site in his spare time and was soon getting 20,000 unique visitors a month. That was enough to encourage him to approach Mr. Hancock, an old friend from university, to see if the concept could be expanded. “I thought, bloody hell, that’s pretty impressive,” Mr. Hancock recalled. He took the idea to some investor friends and raised enough money to launch Nub News on a bigger scale.
Mr. Hancock said the business model is simple; keep each town’s website intensely local and automate as much of the non-news content as possible. That frees the reporters to write stories and work with contributors who add to the news coverage. Nub News has one reporter cover three towns and everyone works from home. The content is free and revenue is generated by local businesses sponsoring pages on the site, such as news, obituaries, travel or sports.
Mr. Hancock says he needs about £12,000 (about $20,480) in annual revenue in each town to break even.
One of his early hires was Tim Lethaby, a veteran local news reporter who had been laid off twice from papers that were downsizing. Mr. Lethaby, 40, jumped at the chance to join Nub News last April and he now runs five sites including one covering his hometown of Wells, a town in southwest England that has a population of around 10,000.
The Wells’ site is mix of hard news, such as a recent story about the potential closing of a local mental-health facility, and basic information including weather forecasts, movie listings and the location of speed cameras. There’s also classified ads, travel information, homes for sale and job postings. The latest figures show that roughly three-quarters of the town’s population has visited the site at least once. “You may only get a few hundred hits on stories, but if they are all local people and you are targeting local people, not clicks around the world, you’ve got a very engaged local audience,” Mr. Lethaby said. “People are getting a lot more locally focused and there isn’t anywhere else where they can get this kind information.”
Mr. Waghorn sees Nub News as something of a mission.
He remembers growing up reading the Bridgewater Mercury and he used to supply it with reports about his soccer team. The paper is now part of a collection of titles that are run from a city 20 kilometres away. Nub News “is all about the unloved, forgotten news deserts,” he said. “We want to come in and bring green shoots of news back into that desert.”

Why PEI suddenly has Canada’s worst rental crisis

Full text: Laura Sherry searched for a better apartment in Prince Edward Island for more than two years.
With a baby on the way, Ms. Sherry and her fiancé wanted to upgrade from their basement unit, which had mould issues. But the rental market had few options in their price range, and competition was fierce for new listings.
Making matters tougher, some landlords told her outright they didn’t allow children. So the young family has decided to call off the search and stay put.
“I have zero hope at the moment” for finding a bigger rental, Ms. Sherry said. “My goal within the next two years is to [buy] a house and be out of the rental market.”
Stories like this are common in PEI, where rental housing is in short supply. The circumstances behind its crisis mirror those of distressed markets such as Toronto and Vancouver: Years of lacklustre rental construction, combined with rapid population growth, led to a steep decline in vacancies.
In PEI, the transition was especially swift and severe. The apartment vacancy rate plunged from a lofty 7.1 per cent in 2013 to 0.3 per cent in 2018.
For three-bedroom units, nothing was available.
Of late, there’s been a hint of progress. The apartment vacancy rate improved to 1.2 per cent in 2019, according to recent Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. figures.
Even then, PEI remains the worst province for rental availability, highlighting the challenge ahead as policy makers devote millions in new money to helping alleviate the crisis.
“Are we moving in the right direction? Absolutely,” said Ernie Hudson, Minister of Social Development and Housing.
“Are we at the point that we want to be at? No, there is more work to do.”
Rental demand picked up speed under the previous provincial government, experts say. With PEI aging quickly, much like the rest of Atlantic Canada, the governing Liberals made population growth a central tenet of their economic plan, tapping into higher allotments of skilled immigrants to thwart, or at least slow, a demographic crisis.
For a province of slightly less than 145,000 people at the end of 2015, a big impact took little time to materialize. Over the past four years, PEI’s population has increased by 9 per cent (about 13,000), easily highest among the provinces, and well above 5.5-per-cent growth for Canada as a whole.
“PEI is such an anomaly, in terms of being a small market, that it can shift in any direction very rapidly based on an influx or an outflow of population, government policy changes, you name it,” said Chris Janes, senior analyst at CMHC.
Meanwhile, rental construction was anemic. Between 2000 and 2017, an average of 151 rental units were completed each year, with considerably more emphasis on building single, detached homes. That’s hardly surprising, given that modest home prices made ownership a realistic option for many residents.
“I bought my house five years ago, and I had options for under $150,000,” said Aimee Power of PEI Fight for Affordable Housing, an advocacy group.
More recently, PEI’s housing market has ignited. The median sale price for a detached home hit $260,000 in the fourth quarter of 2019, up 35 per cent from a year earlier, according to the Canadian Real Estate Association. That was a new record.
With ownership more expensive, renters snapped up available units, and price hikes often outpace wage gains. While the average monthly rent was $900 last year – the province has rent-control rules that cap annual increases for occupied units – new listings can easily command double that amount, putting a strain on finances.
Hannah Bell, an MLA for the provincial Green Party, said she knows an employed woman who was living out of her car before moving into an emergency shelter when temperatures dropped.
“She’s going to work every day; she just can’t find anywhere to live that she can afford,” Ms. Bell said. “On a minimum wage, you can’t rent in our market.”
The government has unveiled measures aimed at improving the situation. Last fall, the province’s capital budget included $17.5-million to build 100 publicly owned affordable housing units. The minority Progressive Conservative government has also tripled its funding of rental supplements to financially challenged households, to $6-million annually.
About 1,000 households now receive rental support, Mr. Hudson said.
Further, the government started a program in October that offers forgivable loans of $45,000 for every unit of affordable housing that gets built, subject to approval. To date, one development has been announced, for six units in Summerside.
Private developers have proven nimble, data suggest.
There were 615 rental unit starts in 2019, according to CMHC, a record high and nearly triple the previous 10-year average.
For the first time in years, local builders are putting more focus on rental units than detached housing.
“A lot of these builders may have never built a multi-unit apartment, but they’re quickly finding out how to do it and doing it successfully,” Mr. Janes said.
Rental demand should remain strong, reinforcing the need for greater supply. Over the coming year, Mr. Hudson expects the province’s population to increase by another 3,000 people, give or take.
But given how developers have responded, CMHC’s Mr. Janes expects the rental market to eventually show more balanced conditions.
“Right now, if the current build rate continues at what it is, I think we’d expect to see some normalization within the next two to three years,” he said.

Full text: VANCOVUER Is Vancouver really one of the most livable cities in the world? That depends if you include a decent income in your definition of “livable.”
The economic engine of a city is key to its success, and while Vancouver is regularly touted and ranked as one of the most livable cities in the world, the truth is that it has a long way to go economically. The affordability crisis isn’t just about a lack of affordable homes; it’s also about a lack of decent-paying jobs. While certain industries in Vancouver are seeing growth, many residents are struggling from paycheque to paycheque.
That’s part of the reason that Vancouver ranked way down the list, at No. 41 out of 100, on the Resonance Consultancy’s annual list of Best Cities, one of the most comprehensive rankings globally because its criteria include not just standard livability statistics such as crime and education, but also economic indicators. Vancouver gets its middling rank because of its high cost of entry.
“Always on the lookout for foreign investment, various incarnations of provincial and federal governments made citizenship available to foreigners with sufficient capital, with little oversight on taxing outside funds. As such Vancouver’s housing prices are now mostly hitched to a global context, largely decoupled from local wages,” says the report released earlier this month.
The city scored higher marks for its diversity of people and for promotion, at which it excels.
“It’s quite valid to look at that livability, but the reality we found in our research is that livability does not lead to prosperity,” says Chris Fair, president and chief executive officer of Resonance Consultancy. “Vancouver needs to become a great city to do business in, and to make sure there is a wide variety of opportunity here from an economic perspective, and that money doesn’t just come to live here, but it’s the place where money is made.
“We don’t spend enough time looking at Vancouver and why household incomes are so much lower than other comparable cities,” he adds. “I don’t think, realistically, housing prices are going to decline significantly. So the question becomes, how do we attract better paying employment?
… And how do we create affordable housing or more attainable housing, to make sure this can be a place for all kinds of people to live, and not just people working in the tech sector?” It’s the fifth year that Resonance has released its rankings and for the third year running London took top spot, followed by New York, Paris, Tokyo and Moscow. Toronto took 17th spot, Montreal is 45th, Calgary is 48th, Ottawa is 77th and Edmonton is 83rd on the list. Resonance judges each city with a population of more than one million by how it’s viewed by locals, visitors and businesses.
“I think certainly Vancouver is a city whose image and perception globally is higher than what the actual product delivers,” Mr. Fair says. “Vancouver under performs economically for a city of its size. But, that is also rapidly changing.”
Mr. Fair cites the significant increase in new office space and the arrival of major companies such as Amazon to Vancouver, which is bringing an estimated 5,000 jobs to the city, if not more. According to a Globe and Mail story from last year, the e-commerce company, based in Seattle, has a deal for 1.1 million square feet of office space in an office block downtown, leasing two new towers under development and making it the city’s biggest corporate tenant.
“I expect we’ll see that in rankings over the next four or five years, Vancouver will move up in that [prosperity] category and become not just a great lifestyle city, but a great city to do business in.”
Mr. Fair is a futurist who helps governments and developers gauge future growth and infrastructure and he studies cities in terms of real estate, economic development and tourism. About 80 per cent of his work is in the United States, such as working with the City of Los Angeles on its future needs when visitors to the 2028 Summer Olympics arrive.
For the past decade, he’s helped revitalize Calgary’s downtown.
He’s also worked globally, consulting for Copenhagen, Barcelona and Edinburgh.
As business picks up in the region, Vancouver’s high housing costs and traffic congestion won’t be a turnoff for those migrating to the city for jobs. Mr. Fair has found that people are quite willing to put up with high prices and some traffic to live in big, vibrant cities. San Francisco, Seattle, New York, Toronto, Sydney, Hong Kong and London are some of the most expensive and congested cities, and yet they are thriving. Mr. Fair has discovered that cities of all sizes see complaints about traffic, even his clients in Tulsa, Okla. And people who migrate to a city for a job generally don’t care about the high cost of housing.
Society adapts to the housing situation, he says.
“Housing affordability is a critical issue that all cities struggle with, but businesses and jobs are largely going to places which have poor housing affordability,” Mr. Fair says. “If cheap housing and no commute really were the most important things, we would all be living in small towns, and that’s not the case. In reality, we are making trade offs where there is more opportunity in places where housing is expensive and there is more culture.
“In an ideal world, a city like London would have no traffic and cheap housing, but that is never going to happen.”
However, there are increasing options for those who do want out of the concrete jungle. The growth of second-tier cities that operate just outside the hub of “superstar cities” is going to escalate in the next decade, he forecasts. In the case of Vancouver, second-tier cities already well underway include Victoria and Kelowna, where there are already tech job markets. Those cities are poised to grow even more, because of short commutes to Vancouver.
“They are also exploding and they are offering the goldilocks scenario of not too hot, not too cold, but just right, where you can have economic opportunities but more affordable housing, shorter commute time to work and hop on a plane and be in Vancouver in 45 minutes if you want to access the city for the weekend. We see that happening around New York, Chicago, Dallas, in these large cities where they are not going to solve the housing affordable problem.”
As a way of life, cities are booming and Canada is one of the most urbanized countries on earth, with 80 per cent of the population living in urban areas, Mr. Fair says. The primary factor for Canadian growth is international immigration and a population that is well educated and highly skilled. Toronto is the fastest growing city in North America because of immigration, according to a 2019 report from Ryerson’s Centre for Urban Research and Land Development, based on Statistics Canada data.
Immigration and diversity of people is not a universal feature of a city, and Toronto and Vancouver are outliers because of their diversity, Mr. Fair says. Vancouver’s multicultural landscape has helped drive the jobs market and he says we can thank U.S.
President Donald Trump for that.
As a result of our pro-immigration policies, the film industry, tech, engineering and professional services jobs are growing in Vancouver. Vancouver ranked sixth on the list in terms of diversity of people.
“I think we think that’s normal, but it’s actually quite exceptional. There aren’t that many U.S. cities that perform well in the people category – even Seattle is 31st. They just don’t have the same level of immigration and diversity that Canadian cities do.
And when you look at Trump’s immigration policy – and this is anecdotal, an opinion – but one of the best things that ever happened to Vancouver’s economy was Trump getting elected, because [tech companies] can put employees here, just two hours from their headquarters in Seattle and they can get visas for international talent and bring them into Vancouver.”
Jill Tipping, president and chief executive officer of tech industry association BC Tech, agrees that an open-door policy has played a key role in attracting skilled workers to Vancouver, which has helped grow the tech sector by about 6 per cent a year for five years. The average salary for a tech worker has climbed to $83,200, far higher than the average income earner. Tech workers want to be in creative, entrepreneurial environments. She says some of the most interesting tech work in the world is happening in Vancouver.
“Typically, a tech worker earns 40 [per cent] to 50 per cent more than the median worker, so they are well paying jobs,” Ms. Tipping says. “For a tech company whether it’s Amazon or a local startup, the most important thing is getting the highest quality talent you can get, so you have to pay them fairly or they leave.”
She also concurs that the high cost of housing does not turn workers away, although the shortage of rental housing in Vancouver is of major concern.
“In many ways, the struggle to get affordable rental housing for tech workers is affordability issue No. 1 for the tech sector in Vancouver.
“But the thing that’s interesting is if you look at the most successful tech eco systems around the world whether that’s San Francisco, Amsterdam, Berlin, Shanghai, they are all high cost of living cities, so it goes with the territory. The tech industry focuses in places where there are high clusters of highly intelligent, demanding-of-lifestyle people and those places tend to be expensive, because they are very attractive. It isn’t a barrier to growing a successful tech sector because we see lots of tech sectors all over the world in the most expensive places in the world.”
But Vancouver needs to step it up. Vancouver’s tech sector, while growing, isn’t keeping pace with comparable cities, she adds.
“It is slower than the growth of tech sectors in other comparable cities … and the reason is, if you ask any tech company in Vancouver or across the province, it’s the availability of talent. It’s at every level.”
As for Mr. Fair’s outlook on Vancouver and its future, he says the city should be careful what it wishes for. As it grows into an economically booming city, government has to plan accordingly for that growth.
“Vancouver has done a fantastic job of planning and positioning and promoting itself to the world, as well, if not better, than any city on the planet over the last 30 years and now we have to live up to it.”
He says quality of life and livability could decline, as well as the socioeconomic diversity of the people who live here. Low- to mid-income groups have already been hit hard by soaring housing costs, a crisis that has transformed the city.
“Vancouver is now on the map.
… The perception of this city internationally is as good as it can get, so mission accomplished there. Now the hard part is, how do we live up to it, to make sure all the things that make Vancouver great aren’t negatively impacted by that growth?”

Full text: Two Canadian pension funds are planning to build 37 new buildings west of Toronto, in what they say is the biggest development project in Canada’s history, as the companies race to capitalize on the housing shortage and low office vacancy rates in the country’s most populated region.
Oxford Properties, the real estate company of Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System, and Alberta Investment Management Corp.
(AIMCo) will spend an undisclosed sum on redeveloping the area around the popular Square One shopping mall in Mississauga.
Called Square One District, the development will encompass 130 acres of land and be home to 18 million square feet of new space, of which 13 million is slated for residential. The total is equivalent to about one-fifth of the total rentable office space in downtown Toronto, according to commercial real estate brokers.
“We think it will bring transformational change,” Mississauga Mayor Bonnie Crombie said. “Our plan is to make our downtown core more walkable and livable.”
Home builder Daniels Corp. will partner with Oxford and AIMCo on the first phase of development that includes a 36-storey apartment building and a 48storey condo tower. Construction is expected to start this summer. Ms. Crombie said the city is in negotiations with the developers over how much space will be set aside for affordable housing in the apartment buildings.
The first new apartment will be offered at market rents.
“The affordability will still be negotiated with Oxford,” she said. The city has approved the developers’ master plan, which means no new zoning is needed. However, Oxford will need permits to start building the new residential towers.
“Discussions on the first phase are well advanced and we are well positioned to start construction in the summer of 2020,” Oxford spokesman Daniel O’Donnell said.
Developing the entire downtown with 37 new towers is expected to take at least three decades.
The lack of housing in the Toronto region has driven up real estate prices and rental rates to levels that are well out of reach of many residents. Local governments have been pushing for denser living arrangements in order to accommodate the growing population in the Greater Toronto Area.
In Mississauga, the average rent for a condo was $2,296 in the last quarter of 2019, up 6 per cent over the previous year, according to real estate consultancy Urbanation.
Developers have focused primarily on new condos and Square One District marks the beginning of a wave apartments or purpose-built rental buildings in the city. Eventually, the new downtown is expected to have 18,000 residential units capable of accommodating 35,000 residents. More than half will be rental apartments.
It is the latest push into a large-scale development in the country. Real estate investment trusts such as RioCan and SmartCentres are ripping up the land around their retail properties and turning the spaces into a combination of apartments, condos, office towers and retail.
“The retail areas are ripe for development. They have large parking lots to develop on and you only have one story to tear down,” said John Crombie, a retail expert with commercial realtor Cushman & Wakefield. “They are finding they don’t need a sea of parking spaces.”
Mr. Crombie, who is not related to the Mississauga mayor, expects this trend to accelerate, as more residents prefer to live close to where they work and as the rise of e-commerce forces mall owners to redo their shopping centres.
Even tracts of land that were once considered a wasteland are now a hot commodity. Pension funds have acquired industrial land around Toronto’s international airport, as well as derelict land east of the city’s financial district.
This will be the second largescale development for Oxford.
The Canadian company teamed up with a U.S. real estate company to develop a new business district in Manhattan called Hudson Yards.
Oxford’s executive vice-president Eric Plesman would not say how much the development project is expected to cost except to say: “It is fair to say it is in the billions.”
This spring, the first office tower will be pitched to potential tenants. Oxford will not build the office space “on spec,” or if it does not secure a major tenant.
Even though Toronto has had the lowest office vacancy rate in North America for more than two years, demand was not as robust in neighbouring cities such as Mississauga.
That trend may be reversing with high office rental rates in the city forcing some businesses to find cheaper locations. “We are starting to see businesses return to the suburbs,” said Jon Ramscar, a managing director with commercial realtor CBRE Ltd.

Full text: Sitting in a sun-splashed office on the edge of the Rhine River that once belonged to West German presidents, Andreas Mundt leans his elbows on a table and nods to a yellow and blue experimental painting by the artist Maiken Bardeschi. It’s called Frei, he says – the German word for free. “I like that a lot,” he says. “Competition law is a lot about freedom. It’s about choice. And this matters a lot to me.”
Mr. Mundt has led the Bonn-based Bundeskartellamt, Germany’s competition watchdog, since 2009.
Over the past decade, he has grown increasingly frustrated with the amount of power the Big Tech companies have accrued because of their mass collection of user data. Most recently, the Bundeskartellamt head had become especially exasperated with Facebook Inc. Specifically, he wanted to put an end to its practice of combining user data collected from its proprietary platforms – Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp – as well as information from third-party websites to build eerily accurate profiles that help advertisers better target users. And he has taken his fight all the way to Germany’s highest court.
In Mr. Mundt’s mind, Facebook’s arsenal of digital data sources – not just the three largest social-media platforms in the world, but also countless other websites its 2.5 billion users visit that contain tracking codes that share data with Facebook – are unmatched and give the company enormous market power. And the granularity of the personal data the platform is able to accrue has the power to influence user behaviour on a mass scale through advertising.
Sometimes it’s as obvious as an ad for a pair of shoes following you around the internet after you browsed for them on Amazon. But such power can also have serious consequences: Russian entities are suspected to have used Facebook ads to help swing the 2016 U.S. election in Donald Trump’s favour. The subsequent Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which the company used Facebook users’ profile data without their permission to target them with political ads, only enhanced mistrust in unchecked data aggregation.
As Silicon Valley’s data-collection capabilities have deepened over the past decade, plenty of jurisdictions have started scrutinizing the role Facebook and other platforms play in the lives of their citizens.
But few countries have been as aggressive as Germany not just in calling them out, but in taking action to curb their Big Brother tendencies. While most recent antitrust rulings against data-driven players have focused on financial punishments (including the European Union’s 1.5-billion fine against Google last year for anticompetitive behaviour in online search advertising), Mr. Mundt didn’t think a mere fine sent a strong enough message. Instead, he wants Facebook to fundamentally change the business model that brings in tens of billions of dollars in ad revenue each year.
In February, 2019, the Bundeskartellamt announced it would prohibit the social-media company from combining user data from multiple platforms. The case is now before the Bundesgerichtshof, Germany’s top court. If he succeeds, Mr. Mundt hopes it will lead to a fairer social internet, one that would give users more freedom and control over how private companies profit from their personal information.
“If we want to deal with the market power of these companies and deal with abuse that might be happening,” he says, “we have to answer the fundamental question of how to deal with these data issues.”
Germany’s fight has potentially huge implications not just for Facebook and its Big Data brethren, but for the billions of people who use their platforms every day. And its privacy-first ethos is spreading.
Here in Canada, federal Privacy Commissioner Daniel Therrien is fighting for greater powers against data abusers. Canada also just spearheaded a move among global privacy commissions to call for greater collaboration with competition authorities to tackle data protection. Multiple U.S. states are building their own antitrust cases against the Silicon Valley giants, calling out their absolute control over consumers’ data (even as the companies themselves claim to face plenty of competition). Facebook’s home state of California has begun enforcing strict privacy laws of its own; New York is expected to follow suit.
Mr. Mundt’s home country is still at the vanguard, however. “Germany is the leading privacy and dataprotection country in the world,” says Ontario’s former privacy commissioner, Ann Cavoukian, who regularly liaised with the country’s privacy authorities during her three terms. “There’s nothing comparable to Germany.”
And Mr. Mundt is certainly not alone. Everyone from German Chancellor Angela Merkel (who late last year urged the European Union to wrest back control of citizens’ personal information and manage it more directly) to grassroots activists to the country’s Berlin-centred startup sector are onside with his crusade.
“Maybe we have to restrict business in certain situations to respect the privacy of every person,” says Samuli Siren, managing director of Redstone VC in Berlin. “I’m totally okay when business is limited when it comes to values that are important to us. I’ll put it this way: Let’s not do business for any price.”
Germany’s fierce pro-privacy bent has deep roots.
It’s been just three decades since the fall of the Berlin Wall – 30 years since the East German domestic spy agency, the Stasi, controlled a web of 90,000 staff and nearly twice as many informants, who tracked citizens to silence dissidents and build paranoia across the country. That, coupled with the Nazi regime’s pervasive use of surveillance and recordkeeping to track Jews and other targeted groups, has left many German people with a deep suspicion of mass data collection.
In 1970, the West German state of Hesse passed the world’s first data-protection law, prompting other states in the Federal Republic to do the same. National legislation requiring consent when a person’s data are processed followed in 1978. A subsequent court ruling that personal data should be constitutionally protected was later built into German law in time for reunification in 1990.
That legacy lives on. Germans still cling to cash, and few independent businesses accept credit or debit payments, wary of creating a digital trail.
There’s less social-media penetration, too: While 53 per cent of Canadians actively used Facebook each month in 2019, only 32 per cent of Germans did, according to research firm eMarketer.
When the EU began exploring a broad data-use framework for the bloc earlier this decade, not only did Germany take a lead in designing it, but the country’s laws served in part as a blueprint, says Sontje Julia Hilberg, a partner with Deloitte Legal in Berlin who focuses on data-protection law. (It was
also premised partly on “privacy by design,” a concept developed by Ms. Cavoukian in the 1990s that insists technology be built with privacy as a foremost consideration.) That framework became the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which went into effect in 2018 and applies to any company that does business in the EU.
GDPR grants EU citizens some of the world’s most extensive rights regarding data collection. People must be informed whenever their personal information is being collected by a website and give their express consent. (That stipulation has had ramifications for web users there and even worldwide, with a wave of consent requests about “cookies” popping up on virtually every site.) GDPR also gives Europeans extensive control over how their data are used.
That includes the right to decide whether those data are processed in the first place and to ask for it to be erased.
Companies that violate the regulations – some of which Facebook lobbied against, according to a Guardian report – can be fined up to 4 per cent of their global revenue. France fined Google 50-million ($72-million) in January, 2019, for providing users with an insufficient consent policy and for not giving them enough control over their data. This past November, Germany fined the real estate firm Deutsche Wohnen 14.5-million over insufficient data-retention procedures.
Privacy regulation isn’t the only front on which Europe is restricting data collection. The EU’s competition commission has served Google with billions of euros in fines because of concerns over the dominant position of its parent company, Alphabet Inc., in the search, app and ad-sales markets. More recently, the EU commission has been looking into the dominance of Facebook’s classified-ads division.
Although the fines have so far been minor (with annual revenue of US$137-billion in 2018, the EU levy was barely a slap on the wrist for Alphabet), the new regulations have brought the importance of data privacy into the public conversation and forced companies of all kinds to consider the value of data protection, Deloitte’s Ms. Hilberg says. “People are now more aware it,” she says, adding that its values are spreading beyond the EU: “It’s become a political instrument to make clear that data privacy should be a worldwide concern.”
Mr. Mundt has been obsessed with how the internet shifts market forces since he arrived at the Bundeskartellamt more than a decade ago. After first fighting resale price-fixing of products sold online, midway through the decade, he shifted focus to the accumulation of data, assigning an internal task force to examine its role in competition. By 2017, the agency had pushed legislators to update Germany’s competition act to factor in access to data when determining a company’s dominance. After all, the biggest digital giants – Facebook, Google, Amazon – built empires by learning all they could about their users.
Even when consumers don’t directly pay to use Big Tech’s services, the Bundeskartellamt argued that data collection created a multisided market in which data creates power.
“If we assume that these are really powerful companies, then we have to deal with the question of: Is the gathering of the data done in an appropriate manner?” Mr. Mundt asks. “For us, this is of special importance, because we are one of the rare countries where this a parameter that is mentioned in the law.”
The Bundeskartellamt’s case argues that the California company’s user terms and conditions, which allow Facebook to aggregate data from its multitude of apps and third-party datasets, are anticompetitive. Because there is no alternative social network with Facebook’s reach, the German agency says, users who want to take part have no choice to agree to its terms. Mr. Mundt believes this could also contravene GDPR, given its strict rules around data collection and consent. “If there were two social networks in terms of quality and network effects – one with privacy and one without – I have no doubt the consumer would choose the one with privacy,” he says.
In August, Facebook successfully appealed the Bundeskartellamt’s case in a regional court, prompting the competition office to take the matter straight to Germany’s highest court, from whom the parties now await a final decision.
Facebook declined to comment on the case, but said in a statement: “The Bundeskartellamt underestimates the fierce competition we face in Germany and the choices people have, misinterprets our compliance with GDPR and undermines the mechanisms European law provides for ensuring consistent data protection standards across the EU.” In short: Facebook believes consumers have plenty of choice – and warns that an EU country taking a standalone position on data runs against the spirit of GDPR.
The regional court also disagreed with Mr. Mundt’s argument that consumers have little choice but to agree with Facebook’s terms and data aggregation. Hamburg competition lawyer Stefan Horn, who has studied the decision, says the court found reasonable flaws in the Bundeskartellamt’s argument. “I would guess people agree with Facebook’s terms and conditions simply because they don’t care, and it does not have any negative impact on their economic freedom,” Mr. Horn said.
But freedom is the word Mr. Mundt has hitched both his career and his Supreme Court appeal to.
Even if he loses, he hopes to at least clarify the role competition law can play in making Big Tech fairer for consumers. “It cannot be,” he says, “that all the laws we have worldwide for the protection of competition are not applicable vis-à-vis these companies.”
Like Mr. Mundt, Germany’s tech sector has been finding new ways to deal with data collection. Although the startup and investment community in Berlin – sometimes jokingly referred to as Silicon Allee – was the second-biggest in the EU last year by venture dollars deployed, behind London, it hasn’t exactly flourished this century. Both capital and public awareness still tends to focus on more traditional manufacturers such as Siemens and Bosch, along with its robust auto sector, which includes Volkswagen and Daimler.
German investors are wary of venture-capital investing, and funds sometimes have an easier time attracting U.S. capital than domestic. Until a few years ago, many of the country’s digital stars merely mimicked successes from other markets, often backed by prominent Berlin venture firm Rocket Internet SE.
But the country’s stringent data-collection regulations might actually be the key to boosting its startup sector. A new generation of digital firms is using Germany’s GDPR-backed, privacy-first mentality to its advantage. “Short-term, it appears like a disadvantage,” says Christian Nagel, managing partner at Earlybird Venture Capital in Berlin. But as more jurisdictions become privacy-minded, he says, “I think it’s a matter of time before it comes to every country.”
Xain AG – short for “the Expandable Artificial Intelligence Network” – is building its entire business around maximum privacy. Machine-learning algorithms are key tools of today’s AI technology, capable of studying large pools of data to help find patterns and develop innovations. To do this, data usually need to be centralized and, under GDPR, sufficiently stripped of identifying information before it can be analyzed. Bringing data to the algorithms is costly and time-consuming, and can result in whole datasets being cast away because they aren’t properly anonymized. Xain’s algorithms work on data at the source with a sophistication typically reserved for AI powerhouses such as Google. Leif-Nissen Lundbæk, Xain’s chief executive, calls the startup a “GDPR-compliant layer for machine learning.”
In his office a few blocks from Berlin’s Brandenburg Gate, he explains the technology through a familiar German lens: cars. Training autonomous vehicles requires studying an extraordinary amount of data about the environment around a car and the human decisions that guide it. But these kinds of data can expose a person’s home, their workplace, their neighbours and passersby, which means it all has to be de-identified. “The problem is that all this data is vastly privacy-sensitive, because we can learn everything about you from you driving around,” Mr. Lundbæk says, adding that Xain has signed partnerships with both Porsche and Daimler (he declined to provide any details).
Xain has also developed an “accounting assistant” called ANDY that automates invoice processes while keeping data private. And the company hopes to integrate with all kinds of data-collecting technologies. As Xain product manager Lea Danschel puts it, “We could be the privacy backbone of every AI application.”
Another AI powerhouse – Google – is a looming presence in Berlin. The company’s local headquarters are here, and in 2016, it proposed building a startup hub in Kreuzberg, a bastion for artists, new immigrants, punks and anarchists just east of Berlin’s core. The proposed development, which would include workspaces, services and mentorship opportunities for local startups, was slated to occupy an abandoned electrical substation. But a local association called GloReiche quickly came out against the plan.
But the movement soon morphed from focusing on the gentrification of one of Berlin’s beloved affordable enclaves to a continuing protest of the power of Big Tech.
Smoking a hand-rolled cigarette last fall as he stood in front of the substation, GloReiche activist Stefan Klein proudly described the numerous demonstrations and sit-ins Kreuzberg’s eclectic residents have held to protest the campus. In October, 2018, the protesters got their wish: Google stepped back from the proposed redevelopment and said it would offer the substation to two social-focused organizations. The company declined to comment on the move, but it said in a statement that after “numerous discussions with initiatives and neighbours,” it had decided to cover rent and other costs for the organizations for five years.
Those two words – “five years” – make Mr. Klein uneasy. Google has a long-term lease on the space.
He worries the company could march back in later, jack up rents, and begin to buy up Berlin-based talent and startups to populate its campus.
One activist, from a prominent faction of the antiGoogle campaign composed of self-described nerds, spoke to The Globe and Mail about what the group sees as the company’s outsized power over the internet. (Their identity is being kept confidential because of potential professional retribution.) The activist said the group hopes to one day dismantle and decentralize that power, which Google accrued by amassing data about its users for nearly two decades across search, e-mail, mobile devices and more, fuelling one of the world’s most successful advertising programs. The activist admitted it would be naïve to believe that stopping the Kreuzberg campus will solve the problems presented by powerful tech giants such as Google. But if nothing else, the protests have made those problems more obvious to everyone around them. Similar groups worldwide now turn to Berlin’s activists to discuss tactics – including Toronto’s #BlockSidewalk campaigners, who are hoping to cancel a “smart” community designed by Google affiliate Sidewalk Labs.
It’s not just activists who are starting to adopt Germany’s approach to Big Tech. In November, Amnesty International issued a report arguing that Google and Facebook’s data-collection terms constitute a “Faustian bargain.” In order to enjoy the vast swaths of the internet to which they provide access, users must sign away their privacy right, creating “a system predicated on human-rights abuse.”
In the United States, antitrust action against Big Tech players has ramped up in the months since the Bundeskartellamt took aim at Facebook, with dozens of states using competition law as grounds to keep better tabs on it and Google. California, home to so many juggernaut tech platforms, has passed a new Consumer Privacy Act with many parallels to GDPR. It came into force in January, and a California Department of Justice study estimates compliance will cost businesses US$55-billion.
“Everybody was scared when [GDPR] came up, because they thought, ‘Oh, we can’t exchange data anymore,’ ” Berlin venture capitalist Christian Nagel says. ”Long-term, I think it will be an advantage, because I think it’s a matter of time before it comes to every country. Because the nature of people is to want security. They want data protection. They want to be in charge.”

Full text: 157 Queen St.
NIAGARA-ON-THE-LAKE, ONT.
Asking Price: $3.25-million Taxes: $10,037 (2019) Lot Size: 75 feet by 104 feet Listing agents: Susan Froese-McHardy, Chestnut Park Real Estate Ltd. Brokerage and Thomas Elltoft, Niagara-on-the-Lake Realty THE BACKSTORY A lot of homes have a story, but some have history. First built in 1792, the house at 157 Queen St. in Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ont., was destroyed during the War of 1812 in what we might today call a war crime, before being rebuilt on the same foundation in 1817.
The charming tourist town, home to the theatrical Shaw Festival, was almost wiped off the map before Canada was ever a country. On Dec. 10, 1813, American troops retreating from Fort George – captured that May from the British forces in Upper Canada – forced the 400 residents of the adjoining village of Niagara out of their homes and burned all the structures to the ground.
Local lore, as recorded in Margaret Dunn’s 1995 book, Historic Niagara-on-the-Lake, says that owner Mary Rogers saved at least one item from the original house: a Baroque Germanic mantelpiece and family treasure brought to Niagara by Conestoga wagon, which was dragged into the street to save it from the flames. It took pride of place in the rebuilt home’s parlour and survives to this day in the two-storey, fivebedroom, 3,300-square-foot mini-manse now being listed for sale by owners Ashley Howe and Michael Scissons.
“James Rogers informed the public that his large house when it was rebuilt was ‘ready to entertain genteel company in handsome style,’ and he added that ‘his liquors were pure and his table supplied with the best the market afforded,’ ” Ms. Howe reads from Ms. Dunn’s book. The descendants of the Rogerses occupied the house until at least the 1990s and it has been an inn and a bed and breakfast at various times.
That’s one reason the front door has a tasteful but prominent “Private Residence” sign. Ms. Howe recalls an instance during her 40th birthday party when a gathering of friends and family – complete with piano player – was crashed by passersby. “All the sudden four people walk in, I don’t know who, they were tourists who thought it was an inn.
They just thought they could drop by!”
It’s not hard to imagine why.
The house is in the city’s walkable historic “Old Town” core, just down the street from a Starbucks and across the street from a grocery store. Ms. Howe moved to Niagara-on-the-Lake when she was five years old and her mother rented a house in Old Town they shared in the summers with a couple Shaw Festival actors (“I had the best babysitters on the planet,” Ms. Howe said). Her mother remarried, bought a more suburban bungalow in town and getting back to Old Town suddenly involved a car, and even though all her summer jobs as a teenager were downtown it wasn’t the same. “As a teenager it felt very far. That was my gripe. … I used to wish that I lived there. Rich people lived there and we were not rich.”
Her career as a relationship therapist and media personality (she was a frequent expert guest on The Marilyn Denis Show, and was a spokesperson for Match.com) took her to Toronto and eventually New York. She got married to Mr. Scissons, also a Canadian but from Saskatoon, who has found success as a tech entrepreneur and serial co-founder. His company-creating track record includes a 2013 bankruptcy (Syncapse) and a 2017 sale (Flashstock sold to Shutterstock for $65-million) and he is currently CEO of recruiting firm Careerlist.
Coming home for the holidays to see Ms. Howe’s mother, who still lives in town, Mr. Scissons fell for the same Old Town neighbourhood she grew up admiring.
In 2017, the couple bought 157 Queen and undertook a year-long project with local heritage experts to restore it from a bed and breakfast into a single-family home. That first summer they spent three months in town, the next year it was more like three weeks, a month in December in the first year turned into only a few short years this Christmas.
New York commitments for their two children started to mean less and less time for Old Town.
“To own a house like this, to have three-day weekends in it … just doesn’t make sense,” she said. “What we thought would feel luxurious and like freedom to have this beautiful house that we can go back to in Canada where we’re from, is starting to feel like a strain or stress because we can’t get to it. Michael has security cameras and he’ll check in on it and I see the dark pictures of the house – it’s just sitting there empty and it makes me sad.”
And so, with reluctance and good advice from the relationship expert for anyone contemplating a breakup they are looking to sell: “Whenever something no longer feels amazing, don’t do it.”
THE HOUSE TODAY The house is basically a white two-storey Georgian rectangle on a corner lot complete with white picket fence. Originally clapboard, now with stucco, over 200 years the house has had a couple additions onto the back, including a garage. The restoration included a new cedar shake roof and all-new copper eaves and gutters. The windows have storm protections but are all built with the original construction methods as per heritage requirements.
The entryway is a centre hall
with staircase to the second floor dead ahead, with a living room on the left and a dining room on the right. It’s not clear if the floors here are original, but the wideplank pine is definitely ancient and it required specialist care to restore its original finish. Both of these front rooms span the length of the front of the house and have wide decorative archways inset in the walls. The living room has the relic of the war mantel (behind it is a more modest den that connects to the rear hallway).
Off the dining room is the kitchen, renovated in a French bistro style inspired by the gasrange and stove Ms. Howe spotted in a New York Williams and Sonoma (its brass fixtures make it look vintage, but it’s all new).
Above it is a custom-made hood strapped with brass, and the room is all white marble, tile and cabinets with brass hardware and fixtures. “I like gold as opposed to silver,” Ms. Howe said. On the wall is another set of stoves, the fridge and a vast squarish seating island fills the centre of the room.
The rear hall has a small hidden servery that connects to the front hall, a practical addition for a set of spaces built for entertaining. There’s a small powder room off the rear hall, but next to it is the door connecting the mainfloor bedroom (part of an addition) to the house. Ms. Howe had hoped her mother would move into this space (no such luck, Mom’s an independent sort) so what is now the guestroom has a solid wall of built-in closet and dresser drawers and a four-piece ensuite washroom done in black and white tile with brass fittings dominated by a large goldframed mirror. “A lot of our bathrooms are inspired by New York places,” Ms. Howe said. “For seven years that’s all we’ve seen: Upper West Side, prewar buildings that have contemporary fixtures and old details like marble and subway tiles.”
Upstairs there are four more bedrooms, along with threepiece, four-piece and five-piece bathrooms (fixtures upstairs are mostly silver, despite Ms. Howe’s affinity for gold). The small landing at the top of the steps splits in two directions.
The rear hallway connects the back bedrooms to a shared children’s bathroom with showerbath, skylight, double vanity and a pink-patterned wallpaper with a repeating motif of some sort of hipster bear with glasses, waxed moustache and a bowtie. To the right is a studio with a connecting door to make it the larger of these rear bedrooms with its own closet (this room also connects separately to the stair-landing). The other bedroom is teeny tiny and has no closet.
The smaller of the two front bedrooms has its own fireplace and a three-piece ensuite with walk-in shower and herringbone marble tile floors. The master suite is dominated by a huge fourposter bed, but has a walk-in closet and a four-piece bath with walk-in shower (the glass doors framed in antique brass, giving it an Art Deco feeling) and separate deep-soaker tub.
THE LOCAL MARKET The house is essentially used as an extremely high-end getaway and party house for her Canadian friends and family, Ms. Howe plays host to 40-odd people for Christmas in Mr. Rogers’s rebuilt house. But even in the short time they’ve owned it, Niagara-on-theLake has seen dramatic price increases.
As has been reported previously in The Globe and Mail, CREA data show the Niagara region has seen the typical home price increase 86 per cent in the past five years, faster than Toronto’s 58per-cent appreciation in the same time. The area includes towns such as Welland and Fort Erie, so the average home is still in the $431,000 range (half of Toronto’s $800,000-plus figure) but the search for affordability has driven more and more families and property investors to communities such as Niagara-on-the-Lake.
Ms. Howe purchased the place for less than $1.5-million in 2017 and after a spare-no-expense refit is asking $3.25-million in 2020.
“Something about restorations, you can’t put crap in. We always felt pride in owning something that’s a part of history,” Ms. Howe said. “We wanted things that matched the importance, that were unique and original because the house is. The house really deserved it.”
Old Town is clearly the upper end of the luxury market in the town of 17,000 people, but then again there aren’t a lot of heritage homes in Ontario with Upper West Side-inspired finishes that are veterans of the War of 1812.

Full text: The City of Vancouver has begun rolling out a new incentive program to encourage the development of rental housing projects, but there is one looming tower that will get more pushback than any of the others.
That is the 28-storey rental tower proposed at 2538 Birch St., at the corner of W. Broadway, which is an old Denny’s restaurant site. It’s by far the biggest rezoning proposal under the new pilot program and it’s also “higher than anything on the entire Broadway Corridor to date,” says observer Frank Ducote, an urban-design consultant and former senior urban designer for the City of Vancouver.
The Vancouver General Hospital Jim Pattison Pavilion tower is taller, but it’s several blocks further east and a couple of blocks off Broadway. At Kingsway and Broadway, further east still, there is the shorter 21-storey Independent, which caused huge controversy and community pushback because it looms over the Mount Pleasant neighbourhood. Mr. Ducote and others believe that while rental housing is crucial, that need doesn’t rule out other urban concerns. Mr. Ducote says it’s not only the height that’s raising eyebrows, but the usable floor space that is being considered – which is more than three times the zoned maximum for the site. That’s more density than the average building on downtown Georgia Street, according to one developer.
“There are those who ask, ‘But what about the need for rental housing, which this application proposes?’ ” Mr. Ducote wrote in an e-mail he sent while travelling. ”Oddly enough, I think the kinds of speculative demands for greater densities and resulting increases in land value that this project would engender could make rental housing for the local work force even more difficult to deliver.
“Further, I truly hope that this very valid need doesn’t lead to a willingness to introduce such scale-breaking developments, without the certainty that comes with a valid planning process.”
Rezoning for the project falls under the city’s Moderate Income Rental Housing Pilot Program (MIRHPP), which waives development levies in exchange for construction of buildings whose residential floor space are devoted entirely to rental units, with 20 per cent of that floor space reserved for households earning between $30,000 and $80,000. The new city council inherited the program, which is encouraging spot rezonings in the name of much-needed rental housing in a city with a vacancy rate of less than 1 per cent.
In December, council approved the first two projects part of the pilot program, on the city’s east side on Renfrew Street.
Council also approved a fivestorey rental building at Larch Street and West 2nd Avenue on the city’s west side, which was controversial with some city councillors because of concerns that the developer was getting a better deal than the city, with the majority of units rented at market rate and only 13 suites tagged for lower incomes. Jameson Development Corp. is the developer of both this site and the site at 2538 Birch St. For the Larch project, the developer got triple the density normally allowed, and because fees were waived, the project was subsidized. COPE Councillor Jean Swanson, one of three councillors who voted against the project, (along with NPA Councillor Colleen Hardwick and Green Party Councillor Adriane Carr), said there were concerns that the city was giving away far more than it was getting out of the deal.
Council will approve 20 projects for the first round of MIRHPP, and public hearings get underway Jan. 21 for the next three rezoning applications in the program. Those projects include two 14-storey rental buildings by PCI Developments on East Hastings, which have also been the subject of community pushback, and a site near Trout Lake on Stainsbury Avenue, for a five-storey building with 80 rental units, with about 13 of them for moderate incomes.
The proposal for the 28-storey rental tower at Broadway and Birch will dwarf all existing midrises in the area, and residents from the neighbourhood are gearing up for a fight. A date has not yet been confirmed, but it’s expected that it will also go to public hearing in the early part of the year. The developer, Jameson, had already been approved to build a 16-storey rental tower, which didn’t cause any apparent concerns with residents. But when the new rental incentives program came along the company applied to build to 28 storeys instead.
Out of 248 rental suites, 53 will be for MIRHPP. Residents are worried that it will be “the thin edge of the wedge” for more high-rises that will transform the fabric of the neighbourhood and drive up prices. The area is currently a blend of mid-rise and old three-storey walk-ups, with a paucity of parks and no elementary schools within walking distance.
In response to the 28-storey development, the grassroots Fairview/South Granville Action Committee formed in November, 2018. The committee has more than 600 supporters who are all residents of the area. It started the 28 Floors Campaign to advocate on behalf of the group regarding the project slated for 2538 Birch St., as well as the continuing Broadway Plan, and other development issues.
“With respect to the redevelopment of the Denny’s site, we support the approved 16-storey building and oppose the proposed 28-storey building,” member Sean Nardi says.
In an interview, Mr. Nardi said the proposal is “jumping the queue” on the City’s two-year plan for the area in preparation for the new subway line that will run along the Broadway corridor.
The plan looks at housing, jobs and amenities along the major transit route, and will determine building heights and density. Mr. Nardi, a technology consultant in financial services, says a major proposal such as the one at 2538 Birch St. should be part of those discussions, particularly when it could set a precedent for similarly dense high-rises in the area.
“I did a walk up and down Broadway, and when you start to look at the buildings in the neighbourhood and several blocks away, you are talking about something dramatically different from everything else,” Mr. Nardi says. “[The plan] is completely changing the landscape.” The group says they have faced the wrath of people who have called them NIMBYs, which they say is used to unfairly label residents with concerns about issues such as density, added congestion or height. They say it’s a tactic to shut down the conversation instead of listening to potentially valid concerns.
“The word has been weaponized,” says Ian Crook, a retired bank executive who lives in a mid-rise in the area, but not adjacent to the site. He doesn’t stand to lose his view and neither does Mr. Nardi. They are more concerned with a lack of infrastructure, building height and scale that will overwhelm the area, and the potential to set a precedent and raise land values.
“Anybody who speaks in opposition is called a NIMBY. So if you raise a question, you’re a NIMBY and by definition, you are a terrible person,” Mr. Crook says.
“It’s become about the same grade level as saying someone is a racist,” Mr. Nardi says. “After you say that, it’s like there is no battle. It’s an atomic bomb … and it’s cheap. So much for having a healthy dialogue about something and figuring out things collectively.”
Mr. Crook and Mr. Nardi are also critics of the MIRRHP program – although they stress these are their personal views and not those of the Fairview/ South Granville Action Committee. Mr. Crook, who spent 34 years in banking and continues to work as a consultant, acknowledges the city needs to offer inducements to build affordable units. But he says the argument for doubling the height of a building in order to build those units, especially given financial incentives from the city, doesn’t make sense to him.
Developer Michael Geller has successfully applied for many spot rezonings over the years in Vancouver, but he too has an issue with this one. It’s just too big, he says.
“They are calling me a NIMBY now,” he says with a laugh. “People don’t normally expect me to be on the side of a neighbourhood group opposing a taller building, and that’s one of the reasons I’ve publicly added my voice. They are not being NIMBYs, they are actually right in questioning this particular development at this particular time, with this particular history. In other words, it had already been rezoned.
“I’ve done a lot of spot rezonings, and I continue to advocate for rezonings where I think the zoning isn’t right. But the issue to my mind here is that the zoning that was already put in place – even though it more than doubled the zoning – was fine and the height going to 16 storeys was fine, because it’s a rental housing project, and you needed additional density to make the economics work.
“But now, as someone who’s looking at it from a planning point of view, in terms of what the building will look like for the next 50 or 100 years, I think this building is too big and I do not accept the fact that a percentage of the units will be affordable to those earning 30 per cent of the median income. That to my mind does not justify the additional height, with one exception. And that is if the city and Vancouver residents think that that level of density is acceptable along the Broadway corridor.
And then I think you could at least look at the application within the context of a Broadway corridor plan, given the SkyTrain is coming and so forth.
“But my personal view is that there are limits to density.”

Calgary housing prices down more than 10% over past five years

Full text: Calgary home prices have dropped by more than 10 per cent in the five years since Alberta’s economic downturn began, and the market is expected to dip down more in 2020 as slower sales and cautious buying become the “new normal” in Alberta’s largest city.
But even as a “persistent oversupply” of homes worth more than $500,000 remains, overall market prices will not drop by much this year, according to the Calgary Real Estate Board’s annual forecast on Tuesday.
The forecast from CREB chief economist Ann-Marie Lurie said that if the economic climate and employment levels do not worsen, and if population growth is steady and lending rates are favourable, the housing market should be more stable in 2020 than in the previous year.
Prices for all housing types – apartment-style condos, attached and detached homes – dropped an average of 3.4 per cent in 2019. The board forecasts a 0.7-per-cent price decline in 2020.
Overall sales activity, which dropped significantly two years ago, could improve slightly.
But a still-weak economy and the possibility of more job losses weigh heavily on Calgary. The unemployment rate is 7.1 per cent, well above the national rate of 5.6 per cent.
“We are settling into a new normal of slower sales, supply choice, limited price growth and a cautious consumer,” the forecast said.
In the first years after the price of oil dropped in late 2014, empty condo units in projects planned when crude prices were high were the biggest sore point in the city’s real estate market.
Today, Calgary still is oversupplied with apartment-style condos. But the problem of more supply than demand for higherend housing is the new focus of concern.
The city’s cohort of well-paid, white-collar workers in oil and gas and related sectors such as finance has been significantly whittled down.
The remaining jobs pay less and most job growth is in lowerpaid sectors.
Correspondingly, sales have increasingly been homes costing $500,000 or less. The weak job growth for higher-paying positions – along with stricter lender requirements – have hit demand for homes priced above $500,000.
Such residences make up 60 per cent of the Calgary sales inventory, the forecast says.
“Weakness in the higher-paid sectors of the job market, combined with the uncertainty regarding future job prospects in the city, will continue to create divergent trends in the housing market,” the CREB report said.
Calgary’s real estate market could do better than expected this year if changes to mortgage rules, decreases in mortgage rates, and positive momentum in construction of pipeline projects improve consumer confidence and job prospects.
But the changes may not materialize. The CREB report notes that job growth did get better in 2019, but at the end of the year, Calgary and other parts of the province recorded job losses.
Calgary stands in contrast to Ottawa, a similar-sized Canadian city, where a strong job market meant detached home prices increased by almost 9 per cent in 2019.
Just a few years ago, Calgary had significantly higher home prices than the capital. Now, the benchmark price for a singlefamily home is near identical in the two cities – $466,443 in Ottawa and $467,330 in the Calgary region, according to the CREB report.
Long-time local realtor Len T.
Wong said Calgarians have been affected by recent bad news, including layoffs at Husky Energy Inc., Encana Corp.’s decision to move its head offices to Denver and questions about how deep provincial government cuts to public sector spending will go. He said he believes Calgary home prices are likely to drop 3 per cent to 5 per cent this year, significantly more than the real estate board predicts.
“People are waiting and seeing what is going to happen,” Mr. Wong said in an interview.
A shift in mindset is taking place, he added. He’s having to tell potential sellers that if they bought their properties in the past decade, they’re likely to get only the same price they paid, or less.
“It’s something that we’re not used to.”

Together, under one roof: For everyone from cash-strapped millennials to multigenerational families, co-living spaces are becoming a more attractive housing option. Matthew Hague previews an Interior Design Show exhibition that gauges how much we’re willing to share

Full text: In order to live in a nicer home, move to a better neighbourhood or afford to buy a house at all, are you open to splitting with friends? If so, what rooms, exactly, would you be willing to share? You might have a bedroom to yourself, but could you sacrifice free rein in the kitchen? How about autonomous rule over your own bathroom or living area?
These are questions being asked by a provocative installation at Toronto’s Interior Design Show, on from Jan. 16 to 19. Dare to Share, designed by local architecture studio Picnic Design, is a house-shaped pavilion featuring mini models of different amenities such as laundry facilities and home gyms. As visitors pass through, they are given stickers that say “yes” and “no” and asked to fix their yeses to the parts of the house that they are happiest to designate common property, and the nos to those that are too precious to pool.
“We’re basically doing a big, analogue survey,” Picnic Design’s Joanne Lam says. “I am very curious to see what spaces people could imagine sharing.”
For a designer such as Lam, the interest is neither abstract nor academic. It’s her way to understand what people across a wide range of demographics want from increasingly in-demand co-living setups. For millennials, combining resources might be the only way to pay for Canada’s pricey real estate (home prices have tripled in some markets over the past 20 years). On the flip side, many seniors are starting to co-habitate to deal with what’s been referred to as a loneliness epidemic. According to the latest census data, one in four seniors lives alone, increasing the risk of depression, anxiety and heart disease.
Regardless of age, one common issue for the designers of coliving spaces is that no one over 21 wants to feel as though they are living in a seedy college dorm, with no privacy, prison-grade furniture and the kind of grungy showers that necessitate wearing plastic sandals. That’s where good architecture and interiors can help, elevating a humble concept such as co-living into something that feels more luxurious.
Some of Canada’s first largescale co-living projects are investing in design. When Node opens a 38-unit building in Kitchener, Ont., in 2021, it will have spaces created by Toronto’s DesignAgency. Its renderings depict inviting living spaces – exposed brick walls, white oak floors, mid-century-inspired furniture – that have more in common with the firm’s other projects, including the restaurant Momofuku, the private members club Soho House and the Broadview Hotel, all in Toronto, than undergraduate digs.
Common Living, North America’s largest co-living property managers, has its own in-house design studio that is currently working on plans for its first project in Canada, near downtown Ottawa. When complete in 2022, it will look nothing like university housing (fitting, given that the average age of Common Living building residents is 30). Rather than a long, dark corridor lined with pokey cells, each two- and three-bedroom suite will have a common kitchen and lounge areas, many with views of the Ottawa River. Also, each room will be fully furnished in a calm, Scandinavian aesthetic. Imagine lots of cool greys, offset with warm oaks and the occasional glossy subway tile.
“Residents can personalize their space,” says Brad Hargreaves, founder of Common Living. “It’s just that many people don’t necessarily have a lot of furniture, and don’t want the expense of buying it.”
A major benefit of sharing a Common Living flat is that the rents tend to be 30 per cent less than comparable one-bedroom units. Pricing for the Ottawa project is expected to start at $1,225 a month, and include WiFi, electricity and perks such as rooftop yoga and weekly housekeeping (a plus for preventing spats over unswept floors or crumbcovered counters).
Node and Common Living work particularly well for renters. But Picnic Design’s Lam also imagines that co-living can accommodate people who want to own as well, such as parents with children or seniors who no longer want to live by themselves. And rather than an expansive building, she’s picturing something low-rise, maybe three storeys, on a quiet residential street.
Right now, there is a dearth of such projects. Zoning is tricky, favouring single-family homes over anything that is remotely set up such as a rooming house. Similarly, mortgage financing is harder to secure. “Banks are risk averse,” says real estate agent Lesli Gaynor, whose company GOCO specializes in co-ownership properties and is a partnering with Lam on Dare to Share at the Interior Design Show. “Even though there are ways to structure the financing to avoid risks, many banks are hesitant to loan to anyone but married couples and direct relatives.”
“There are challenges,” Lam says. “But I’m optimistic that with the changing demographics, these arrangements will become more commonplace and acceptable.”
When that happens, Lam will be ready with designs.
From the outside, one of her mock-ups is indistinguishable from many contemporary urban houses: three storeys, charcoal cladding, flat roof. “The real difference is that, inside, there are separate suites on the upper floors,” Lam says. Some might have chidlren’s rooms, others not. But the suites don’t have their own kitchens, the way they might in a small rental building.
There’s only a single cooking space, on the ground floor, which is a more efficient use of space over all. It allows the individual units to have more square footage for spaces such as sitting areas for private time.
Notable in the design is that every suite has a little balcony, providing access to the outdoors, in addition to a shared backyard.
“That’s part of what’s nice about living in a building that’s low to the ground with access to nice outdoor space in a residential neighbourhood,” Lam says. “I have nothing against condos as a housing type. But not everyone wants to live 40 floors up, where it might be too windy to ever comfortably go outside.”
For the past 16 years, Cheryl Bradbee, a university and college professor, has been living in a Mississauga home custom-built for co-living. It’s one of only a few in the Greater Toronto Area, on a leafy side street in the Clarkson neighbourhood.
“People think this is a new concept, but it isn’t,” Bradbee says.
“Think of the Golden Girls. I started looking at the option in the nineties because I was a single woman, heading toward 40, and I thought it was a straight-forward way to gain equity. I also thought it made sense as a model for women who didn’t want to age alone. … [Women] live longer than men, but we don’t get paid as well as men, we often don’t have the money for retirement homes.”
In the house, a common ground floor with shared kitchen, living and dining areas has separate entrances for three apartments above, each with windows overlooking surrounding greenery. To finance the $1.5-million construction, it helped that one of her co-owners had inherited a million dollars from a grandmother.
Although the house is now for sale for $2.7-million (one of the co-owners was ill, and needed to move out for substantial care), Bradbee enjoyed co-living so much that she is keen for a repeat.
Her key learning was to ensure all contingencies were spelled out in advance. “It’s good to have a reserve fund in place for major repairs,” she says. “After my place sells, I plan on doing another coliving setup – this time, with my sister.”

Full text: 179 Old Yonge St., Toronto YORK MILLS Asking price: $4,295,000 Selling price: $4.2-million Previous selling price: $3,590,000 (2016) Taxes: $17,854 (2019) Days on the market: Three Listing agent: Stephen Sun, Re/Max Realtron Realty Inc.
THE ACTION In recent years, agent Stephen Sun has seen property values plummet 20 per cent to 50 per cent around York Mills Road and Yonge Street. Although this modern, side-split home was likely to stand out from predominantly traditional neighbours for many reasons, Mr. Sun heavily promoted it to younger locals and international buyers in late October.
“Just in the York Mills/Hoggs Hollow area, there were about 70 homes for sale and the average sale per month was about five or six homes, so a lot are still sitting on the market,” Mr. Sun said.
“It’s on a very unique street where you’ve got homes ranging from $2-million up to $9-million, depending on if they’re brand new, two-storey mansions versus older ones.”
WHAT THEY GOT A 76-foot-by-150foot corner property was redeveloped a few years ago to create this roughly 6,000-square-foot home spanning five levels, including the finished basement.
All above-ground floors feature 10-foot ceilings and oversized sliding patio doors line the dining room and two entertaining areas.
On the top two floors, all five bedrooms contain walk-in closets and private bathrooms. The master suite also has a balcony and a double-sided, gas fireplace.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “This is a very unique home because they don’t build side splits any more,” Mr. Sun said.
“This house was built like a California-style home with big patio windows that will slide open and disappear … [which] is not common to find.”
The heated double garage with a car lift was prized, as was its proximity to transit, with the York Mills subway station a 10-minute walk away.

Full text: 26 Fredas Point Extension CHESTER, N.S.
Asking price: $2,750,000 Taxes: $9,715.00 (2019) Lot size: 1.6 acres Agents: Margaret Craig (Engel & Volkers) THE BACKSTORY Tim Unwin and James Wright were friends at Dalhousie University in Halifax decades before the lawyer and the architect would collaborate on a project on the shores of Nova Scotia’s picturesque Mahone Bay.
In 1997, Mr. Unwin was a partner at Toronto-based Blake, Cassels & Graydon LLP when he purchased two vacant lots on a peninsula in the village of Chester and asked Mr. Wright to design a house for the property.
“Jamie is from Nova Scotia and he had a very good sense of what is Nova Scotian,” Mr. Unwin says.
The firm of Young + Wright was part of a partnership that designed Toronto’s SkyDome stadium in the 1980s. The architects’ other notable projects include the Rexall Centre, York University’s Schulich School of Business and OCAD University. Mr. Wright currently sits as a director at IBI Group Architects after it acquired his firm in 2008.
While he built his career working on large, public buildings, Mr. Wright welcomed the chance to design a family’s seaside escape.
“He was delighted to do this more residential project,” Mr. Unwin says, describing how the two spent many evenings together with pencil and paper, and the help of a little whisky.
Mr. Unwin describes the peninsula as “a very special part of Chester.” The land is actually an island, but today it is joined to the mainland by a causeway.
“Everyone calls it the peninsula,” Mr. Unwin says. “It’s a very desirable and lovely location.”
At one time the peninsula was entirely owned by the Pew family, he explains.
Joseph Newton Pew was a Philadelphia-based industrialist who founded Sun Oil Co. in 1886. The company grew to become one of the largest gasoline distribution companies in the United States and was later renamed Sunoco. As their business interests expanded, the Pews added shipbuilding and chemical operations to their holdings.
The Pew descendants had been summering in Nova Scotia since the late 1880s. Over time, they sold off land for development. Mr. Unwin purchased the last two parcels, next door to the original Pew family home.
The south shore of Nova Scotia continues to draw an international crowd, with visitors drawn to the area’s rocky promontories, fishing villages and sailing on the Atlantic Ocean.
“Because of the Pews, Chester has been a very popular destination for Americans over the years,” Mr. Unwin says.
THE HOUSE TODAY Mr. Unwin and his wife, Anne, favoured a dwelling in the traditional Cape Cod style.
Mr. Wright also introduced the couple to the work of celebrated American architect Robert Stern, who designed many significant coastal homes.
The six-bedroom home at 26 Fredas Point Extension, completed in 2000, has 5,850 square feet of living space under its cedar-shake roof. Grey siding and white trim add to the traditional Maritime appearance.
“It’s totally consistent with Nova Scotia,” Mr. Unwin says.
The building’s setting atop a spine running along the peninsula means the residents can gaze toward the bay and the Atlantic Ocean from all of the main rooms.
“We’re elevated, so we have a particularly nice view,” says Mr. Unwin, who can also see his golf club across the water.
Many windows face east, giving early risers a good view of the sunrise. “That old sun comes up, it blasts you if you forget to close the curtains or you’re not up early,” he says.
The opposite side of the property provides sunset vistas.
During the design process, one of the places the Unwins looked to for inspiration was Mr. Wright’s own country property. The architect had converted a barn north of Toronto into a spectacular home, Mr. Unwin says. “I had been several times and admired his great room.”
The expansive room was noteworthy for having a fireplace at each end, says Mr. Unwin, who asked for the same configuration in Nova Scotia.
The main floor great room has a stone fireplace in the living area and another framed by a wooden mantel in the dining area. There are oak floors, panelled walls and a beamed ceiling lightened with a wash of white. The built-in window seats also provide amazing views over Mahone Bay, Mr. Unwin says.
The kitchen – large enough to accommodate an East Coast kitchen party – has a vaulted ceiling, a large island and French doors leading to a stone terrace.
The master suite is separated from the main home by a slate breezeway. There are two bedrooms, an ensuite bathroom and a sitting room. Upstairs, two additional bedrooms have ensuite bathrooms and access to a long, wooden veranda.
Throughout the house, round and oval windows add a nautical feel.
The lower level has a home theatre and a recreation room with a fireplace and a bar with a granite top fashioned after one of Mr. Unwin’s favourite watering holes in New York during the time he was managing partner for his law firm in that city.
Outside, the home is surrounded by slate verandas and terraced perennial gardens. Mr. Unwin says the cedar-shake roof adds to the home’s character. To keep maintenance low, the roof is treated to prevent lichen from growing, he adds, and the exterior siding is made with a grey finish that doesn’t require painting.
Additionally, the property offers 30 feet of waterfront, and a 90foot dock that marks the finish line of Chester’s annual sailing regatta.
“We’ll go down on the wharf, take a picnic lunch and be almost part of the action.”
When the couple’s two children were younger, Mr. Unwin says, the family often ventured down the coast to visit Hirtle’s Beach and other favourite stretches of shoreline. Longer excursions took them to the Annapolis Valley and the province’s wineries.
Mr. Unwin does not sail, but the family sometimes hires a local fisherman to take them on an offshore outing on a fishing boat.
“We’ll have a Cape Islander come and pick us up and off we’ll go to an island for the day.”
THE BEST FEATURE One of the elements inspired by the work of Robert Stern is the octagonal wing, which provides a serene sitting area and library for the master suite.
“It’s like a lighthouse,” Mr. Unwin says. “It has a vaulted ceiling and a cupola above.”
There’s also a walkway around the exterior.
The lower level of the octagon has a bedroom with a full bathroom and French doors leading to the outdoors. “Guests that want a little more privacy really like it,” he says. “They can come and go through their own entrance.”

Full text: Tim Hortons has hired a senior marketing executive from one of its biggest rivals at a time when competition in the coffee sector has presented challenges for the brand.
On Friday morning, the coffeeand-doughnut chain’s parent company, Restaurant Brands International Inc., is expected to announce that Hope Bagozzi has left as director of marketing for McDonald’s Restaurants of Canada Ltd. to become Tim Hortons’ new chief marketing officer. Ms. Bagozzi, who joined McDonald’s in 2004, will be responsible for product development, customer analytics, marketing and advertising.
A number of changes have been made to the executive team for Tim Hortons. Last month, the company announced president Alex Macedo will leave in March.
In November, Tim Hortons hired Chris Main, who was Canadian Tire Corp. Ltd.’s retail technology vice-president, as its new head of restaurant technology, and in December, former Choice Properties REIT senior vice-president Trent Holfeld was named head of real estate development.
In its most recent earnings report in October, Restaurant Brands’ chief executive Jose Cil said Tim Hortons’ earnings “were not where we want them to be.”
While Burger King and Popeyes posted healthy sales increases, Tim Hortons had a slight decline for the quarter ended Sept. 30.
The hires reflect a variety of priorities for the company, RBI chief operating officer Duncan Fulton said in an interview. Mr. Main will be responsible for introducing digital menu boards in all of the chain’s drive-throughs, which will allow franchisees to display different items and promotions depending on factors such as the local weather; rolling out more ordering kiosks in restaurants; and developing the company’s loyalty program. Mr. Holfeld is tasked with finding new sites for Tim Hortons locations, renovating existing restaurants and testing the new smaller urban store formats.
Ms. Bagozzi will be responsible for modernizing the brand, overseeing the advertising fund and marketing strategies and new product development.

Housing starts flat in 2019 due to year-end condo slowdown

Full text: Canadian housing starts slowed at the end of last year, according to the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp., but the federal agency expects them to rebound in 2020 due to population growth and a lack of housing in Toronto and Vancouver.
Housing starts fell 3 per cent in December, 2019, compared with the previous month, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 197,329, driven largely by a decline in new construction of condos and apartments in Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal.
In Ottawa, construction starts of multifamily properties, largely condos and apartments, dropped nearly 50 per cent in December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4,188. Montreal eased 10 per cent to 16,520 and Toronto declined 16 per cent to 16,884.
The declines were offset by robust multifamily construction in Western Canada, with Calgary’s starts tripling to 21,336 seasonally adjusted units and Vancouver steady at 24,840 units.
Over all, CMHC’s preliminary results put starts for all home types last year at 196,729. That was virtually unchanged from 2018, with the growth in multifamily starts offsetting a decline in new detached housing construction. The housing agency cautioned that the annual numbers could be revised.
Economists said the overall slowdown was temporary given the strong population growth, particularly in Toronto, the country’s most populated city. “There is a lot of activity waiting to happen,” said CMHC chief economist Bob Dugan.
Home starts declined in Toronto last year after preconstruction condo sales fell in 2018. That year, fewer multifamily housing projects came to market after the boom of 2017 when home prices soared and developers raced to capitalize on the frenzy with new condo and rental apartment projects.
“Recognizing that the market was on fire in 2017, developers rushed to bring forward as many new launches as they could,” said Shaun Hildebrand, president with real estate consultancy Urbanation. “This left less product that was ready to be brought to the presale market in 2018.”
Mr. Hildebrand said preconstruction sales improved in 2019, which will lead to growth in construction starts this year.
CMHC forecasts a rebound in housing starts this year to as high as 204,300 across the country, owing to population growth, rising incomes and strong employment in British Columbia and Ontario.
The majority of the growth is expected to occur in condos and rental apartments, as CMHC, local governments and developers push denser living arrangements in an effort to deal with the housing shortage and unaffordable real estate prices prevalent in Toronto and Vancouver.
CMHC often compares the average density of Vancouver to New York, which is more than three times denser with 1,700 people for each square kilometre.
The expected rebound in new construction this year comes as Toronto’s resale housing market recovers from a brief downturn in late 2017 and early 2018, when interest rates were rising and Ottawa made it harder for prospective home buyers to get a mortgage.
The average sale price across all types of homes in the Toronto region was $819,319 last year. That was close to the record set in 2017.
“We do expect that condos will be a big part of construction,” CMHC’s Mr. Dugan said. “They will be a big part of the recovery in Toronto.”
CMHC is forecasting a rise in housing starts in Ontario, B.C., Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba, but slower activity in Quebec and Atlantic Canada owing to fewer people forming households.

New BoC survey delves deep for first time into consumers’ outlook on spending, wages and inflation

Full text: The Bank of Canada is about to introduce an important new addition to Canada’s suite of economic indicators – one that focuses on the Canadian consumer at what could be a key juncture for a huge and critical segment of the economy.
On Monday, the central bank will unveil the Canadian Survey of Consumer Expectations (CSCE), a quarterly poll of 2,000 Canadian households. It will release the poll at the same time as the quarterly Business Outlook Survey, its long-standing similar poll of business sentiment.
The CSCE asks Canadians about their expectations on inflation, interest rates, jobs, wages, spending plans and local house prices.
The survey will shed important light on what is unquestionably an underserved segment of the economy, in terms of economic data. Beyond the Conference Board of Canada’s Index of Consumer Confidence, there is little formal tracking in this country of expectations in the consumer sector, which accounts for roughly 60 per cent of Canadian gross domestic product.
Statistics Canada tracks numerous consumer and household trends, but it doesn’t conduct polls on consumer confidence or expectations. The Bank of Canada has been polling businesses for the past 15 years to gauge their expectations on inflation, hiring and spending intentions, but it hasn’t provided similar intelligence on the Canadian consumer until now.
Most importantly, the survey gives the bank key insights into consumers’ inflation expectations.
That’s vital information for a central bank that has relied on an inflation target to guide interest rates for nearly three decades now. As the bank said in a 2015 paper discussing its original creation of the survey, “Inflation expectations are … an important part of the information used by central banks to understand, forecast and control inflation, which is why it is important to have adequate measurements of these expectations.”
The Bank of Canada has actually been quietly conducting the survey since the fourth quarter of 2014, but has kept the results to itself until now.
With five years of data under its belt, it appears the bank feels there is enough historical data now to tell a meaningful story for public consumption.
Nevertheless, the survey hasn’t had a chance yet to span an entire business cycle. Indeed, it has only captured a slice of the expansion phase for the Canadian economy, albeit an important slice – roughly from the onset of the oil shock through the recovery, the start of interest-rate tightening, and the return of the economy to near full capacity.
The first publication of these survey results comes just nine days before the bank releases its quarterly update of its economic and inflation forecasts on Jan. 22. In the previous quarterly outlook in October, the central bank – with data from the survey in hand – forecast that household consumption and housing would improve modestly in 2020, after a sluggish 2019.
It will be informative to see how consumer expectations have evolved since then, and how big a role they play in the updated outlook.
Looking at the bigger picture, what comes next will be new territory for the CSCE, as we approach a phase in the cycle for which there is no historical comparison in this new-ish survey. Unlike with the older Business Outlook Survey, the bank won’t have nearly as good a handle on the likely implications for the economy of shifts in the consumer sentiment trends. Nevertheless, the survey will be an important new addition to the Bank of Canada’s continuing conversation with the Canadian public, about the economy and interest-rate policy.
Indeed, the consumer sector of the economy could well play a pivotal role in Canada’s economic fortunes from here, in what has already been one of the longest expansions in history.
Consumer spending and residential real estate have been critical growth engines for most of the past decade, aided by historically low interest rates. An unprecedented build-up of consumer debt has accompanied that expansion.
Whether consumers can maintain their enthusiasm as the cycle reaches maturity and, eventually, fades, will be a critical factor in where Canada’s economy goes from here.
Given how overextended many Canadian households have become with mortgage and consumer debts, their response to any economic adversity could well have a much larger-thanusual impact on the downside of this business cycle.
As the Bank of Canada looks for cracks in consumer resilience and worries about how debt loads could colour consumer behaviour, the survey could become an increasingly important tool in the bank’s forecasting and monetary policy.
For those trying to understand and anticipate interest-rate policy, this could quickly become essential reading.

Full text: I’d never heard of North Saanich, B.C., until Prince Harry and Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, decided to holiday there over Christmas.
Where exactly is it anyway?
Maybe I should check it out, too.
You’re not alone. North Saanich is a rural municipality on southern Vancouver Island, with fewer than 12,000 people, so it doesn’t get attention like Victoria does, 30 minutes away. But North Saanich is home to Victoria International Airport and the Swartz Bay ferry terminal, so chances are you’ve driven through it on a trip to Victoria and just didn’t know it.
Should I linger longer next time?
Only if you appreciate bucolic landscapes dotted with cows and sheep, shorelines with quiet coves and idyllic beaches, walking and hiking trails galore and charming roadside stands selling flowers and produce. If you enjoy food, North Saanich is also a bit of a hotbed for farm-to-table experiences.
That reminds me, it was because of some restaurant turning down Harry and Meghan that I heard about North Saanich in the first place. What was that all about?
That was unfortunate. Not that they were turned down, but because the area’s most esteemed eating establishment – the Deep Cove Chalet – got some bad press and angry e-mails as a result. The chalet is perennially popular and people would have made reservations for the Christmas holiday weeks, if not months, in advance, so the place was fully booked. You can’t blame the owners for honouring those bookings, can you?
You’ve got a point. But why is it so popular?
In three words, classical French cuisine. But it’s more than that.
The chalet looks west over the Saanich Inlet and the mountains beyond. In summer especially, it’s delightful to stroll the manicured lawn and garden. Indoors, soft candlelight creates a warm ambiance. Pierre Koffel, the chef and co-owner, is a perfectionist, while his wife, Bev, is a gracious hostess, chatting with regulars and taking time to make newcomers feel at home. And the food … You’re making me hungry. But if this place is so expensive and hard to get into, where else might I go?
For dinner, try Porto Osteria in Canoe Cove. It’s simple, unpretentious Italian food. They make all their pasta and bread from scratch. Thursday nights are flight nights with trios of wine. For lunch, the Roost is popular for soups and sandwiches. It began as a bakery and became locally famous when the authors of The 100-Mile Diet cited it as a source for red spring wheat.
On Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, head to the Dakota Cafe, by the airport. Locals line up for their made-from-scratch wonton soup. If you’re looking for picnic fare, stop at the Deep Cove Market or the Fickle Fig. By the way, Harry was spotted shopping at the Fig.
So back to the Royals, what else did they do, so I might copy them?
All we know is that they hiked in Horth Hill Regional Park, because locals spotted them there twice.
But honestly, the trails there are a muddy mess from people horseback riding. North Saanich has more horses for every square kilometre than anywhere else in British Columbia (or so they say).
Serious hikers should head instead to John Dean Provincial Park, recently renamed LAU,WELNEW/John Dean, to include the First Nations’ name for it, where you’ll find old-growth Douglas fir trees and sweeping views over the American San Juan Islands.
And if you’re a cyclist, you can circumnavigate the airport on a paved, family friendly trail.
Those both sound pretty strenuous.
Anything easier?
The footpath along Patricia Bay, with its large tidal flat, is lovely any time of day and particularly at sunset. You’ll also see planes on their approach to the airport.
And what if I prefer water to land?
No problem. With water on three sides – North Saanich is at the tip of the Saanich Peninsula – there’s 40 kilometres of shoreline to explore. Head to Canoe Cove and rent a kayak or canoe. You’ll see seals flopped on rocky islets and bald eagles gazing from treetops.
If you prefer underwater, Rockfish Divers will take you scuba diving. The marine life is amazing, including delicate nudibranchs and lion’s mane jellyfish.
Is there shopping?
Most of us go into Sidney, next door, to shop for everyday items, but North Saanich boasts interesting, one-of-a-kind businesses. Inca Dinca Do, for instance, operates a fibre mill, and even if you don’t have any wool to be spun, stop to see their adorable herd of long-lashed alpacas or to buy kiwi fruit. Speaking of fruit, the owners of Fruit Trees and More pioneered growing citrus trees in the area.
You’ll be amazed by their fully loaded lemon trees. And at the Saturday morning market in Deep Cove, look for handmade fruit pies. Scrumptious! And what if I just want to chill?
Well, the Pacific Ocean is cold year-round.
That’s not what I meant.
Oh, you mean relax? Buy a bottle of estate wine from the Deep Cove Winery and a copy of the West Coast classic memoirs The Curve of Time and find yourself a beach.
What about accommodation?
Harry and Meghan stayed at a multimillion-dollar waterfront mansion owned by Russian oligarch Yuri Milner, who is friends with musician David Foster, who is friends with the Royals. If you don’t have those kinds of connections, there are plenty of charming bed and breakfasts. Chances are, you’ll soon be looking to buy your own piece of real estate anyway in this B.C. paradise.

Shanghai is beating the world at video games: City spends millions on professional gamers and tournaments as China cashes in on booming e-sports industry

Full text: For 20 frenzied minutes, five young men sit side by side, staring at screens where colourful characters duel in flashes of weapons fire and bursts of flame.
“If you told me earlier you didn’t get him, I would have kept my best weapon for the last minute,” a voice calls out from the row of players, seated inside a marbled luxury villa that serves as their digital training ground.
“You’ve lost some blood,” a voice calls out. “I’m dead,” another responds.
It’s a sound sought by governments and well-heeled investors alike in Shanghai, a city at the forefront of China’s bid to grasp power and profit in a digital gaming world that, the industry estimates, generates more global revenue than movies and music combined.
Stadiums, professional leagues, million-dollar salaries, broadcasting and training facilities are all part of an ambitious Chinese strategy to profit from a fast-growing industry – but also to assert Chinese influence on an important, youth-dominated segment of the entertainment universe.
When the game ends, the young men gather in a half-circle around a large monitor, where Luo Shou, their manager at the Topsports club, shuttles through a replay of the League of Legends battle they’ve just completed. He is not pleased. The team has deviated from the strategy he had set out.
The players, who rarely leave this elevator-equipped luxury villa – sleeping on the third floor, training daily on the ground level, eating regional delicacies prepared by a dedicated nanny – defend themselves. One says he felt like giving up because the opponents “were so severe and cruel.”
Mr. Luo ends with a few words of praise.
Then, they swing back to their computers, beneath the writing on the wall that says, in English: “Set the goal of training the place where will never reach, sometimes you will feel tired, hesitate, even depressed, but don’t give up, because victory is not a miracle.” It’s an exhortation to achieve that could as well describe the ambitions of Shanghai, a port city that has itself been in search of greatness – not just in League of Legends, but in the broader esports industry of professionals playing and broadcasting.
The city wants to become what Zhu Qinqin, deputy director of the Shanghai E-Sports Association, calls “the e-sports centre of the universe.”
The dense coastal city, with some of the most expensive real estate in China, has devoted a sixsquare-kilometre commercial area to the industry.
It created an official identity certificate to register e-sports athletes inside its borders.
It has also succeeded in attracting major tournaments to the city, including the 2020 League of Legends World Championship, and eye-popping investment, with gaming company NetEase pledging to spend $945-million to build what it calls “China’s first large professional e-sports stadium.”
“From the perspective of policy and government, Shanghai’s esports development plan must be the biggest in the world,” Mr. Zhu said.
In part, it’s a bid to latch onto growth. Where other industries have stagnated in China, e-sports revenues are rising at greater than 20 per cent a year, he said.
“We can see the potential here,” he said.
But it’s also part of a wider Chinese effort to assert influence in an entertainment market with global reach, making e-sports perhaps the most robust soft power venture in modern Chinese history.
While the country’s investors and artists have an uneven track record in penetrating Hollywood, and Chinese musicians struggle outside their home borders, China has made much deeper inroads in digital gaming, bolstered by the size of the market at home.
The world’s largest video game company is Chinese tech giant Tencent, which owns Riot Games (creator of League of Legends), has a 40-per-cent stake in Epic Games (the company behind Fortnite), and has smaller stakes in Bluehole, Ubisoft and Activision Blizzard.
For Chinese authorities, foreign “soccer, American superstar movies, Japanese cartoons – they are a cultural infection,” said Hongyu Chen, a British-educated writer who follows the industry.
E-sports, however, have offered a way “to use culture as a weapon.”
At home, Mr. Chen said, esports “can unite people” – particularly youth – around the national flag, as they cheer on domestic teams that are increasingly successful. Abroad, e-sports can be used to inculcate elements of Chinese culture and enforce official dictates on foreign soil.
Earlier this year, for example, participants in Blizzard games raised controversy when they openly supported protesters in Hong Kong. Blizzard, in response, suspended several people.
In December, NetEase removed Mesut Ozil from its Pro Evolution Soccer 2020 game in China after the midfielder for the Arsenal Football Club in London spoke in defence of Muslim Uyghurs incarcerated in China. NetEase opened a Canadian production centre in Montreal this July.
Chinese gaming executives openly acknowledge objectives that go beyond profit. “This is how we want to pass on our cultural heritage to the younger generation and make them love the ancient culture,” Colin Yao, who leads TiMi Studios at Tencent, told Fortune, as he described the company’s Honor of Kings, the highest-grossing mobile game last year.
That game has also illustrated the difficulty in exporting Chinese values: An overseas adaptation called Arena of Valor has not been a runaway hit.
But China’s pursuit of supremacy in e-sports is proceeding undimmed. Some 40 universities now offer e-sports courses. Companies such as Shanghai-based ImbaTV have rapidly built up entirely new lines of business, including an e-sports hotel and an e-sports experience in a local shopping mall, in addition to competitions the company organizes.
Top e-sports hosts and commentators can earn nearly $2million a year, ImbaTV co-founder Zhou Lingxiang says. Live events in second– and third-tier cities sell out in minutes.
Top players, meanwhile, are signing contracts worth nearly $10-million – and at least 10 of the 16 clubs in the country’s League of Legends Pro League “can afford a price like that,” said Guo Hao, the team’s manager.
The Topsports club occupies three villas in a luxury development on the outskirts of Shanghai – temporary accommodations, until construction is completed on a purpose-built, sixstorey facility, complete with space for “game training, physical exercise, eating and sleeping,” Mr. Guo said. In total, it will measure more than 32,000 square feet.
Budgets are big. In the club’s first year, it spent more than $28million, money that is building both expertise and hopes.
“My goal in life is very clear and very simple,” says Bai Jiahao, a member of Topsports’ core elite group. “I want to be the world champion. Not just in China, but the world.”

Smaller cities see jump in housing as buyers look beyond Toronto: Niagara’s hot market emblematic of investors benefitting from the hunt for more affordable Ontario real estate

Full text: Cheryl Vanditelli and Robert Harris own five houses in Niagara Falls, Ont., the tourist city bordering the United States.
They bought them back in 2015 and 2016, and the market was so good, Mr. Harris quit his job as a tool and die maker to focus on managing and fixing up the properties.
“We went all in with everything we had,” said Ms. Vanditelli, 54, who has since retired from her job at a bank.
They live in one of the houses and keep the other four as rental properties. A local appraiser tells them that every property has doubled in value since they bought it.
Real estate investors are sensing opportunity and snapping up houses in smaller urban centres in Ontario, driven in part by the rise in home prices in Toronto, the country’s second-most expensive market, where the average selling price of a detached house in the city itself and most of the surrounding suburbs is more than $1million.
Toronto’s affordability problems have homeowners looking to locate in smaller cities far from a major job centre. The result is that real estate prices in places such as Niagara, St. Catharines and Kingston – though still about half the cost of a Toronto-area house – are now moving up quickly.
In the Niagara region – which includes towns and cities such as Fort Erie, Welland and Niagaraon-the-Lake – the benchmark price, or the industry representation of a typical home sold, was $431,200 in November. That is an increase of 8 per cent over last year, according to the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA) In comparison, the benchmark price in the Greater Toronto Area was $823,700 in November, a 6.5per-cent increase from last year.
The increase is steeper over five years, with the price of a typical home in the Niagara region up by 86 per cent, while the benchmark price in the Toronto area rose by 58 per cent over the same period, according to CREA.
It’s not just investors who are interested in cities such as Niagara and St. Catharines, Ont., where a two-storey house sells for about $450,000. The cheaper real estate prices have made it more desirable for baby boomers, immigrants and young families.
“Baby boomers are cashing out of wherever they are and buying in cash or not having a mortgage,” said Brad Johnstone, a realtor with Royal LePage who has worked in the Niagara region for more than two decades.
“We are also getting young families coming out of the Greater Toronto Area that can’t buy a house,” he said, adding that with more people working from home, it’s easier to settle outside of a major labour market such as Toronto.
“We have got flexible work schedules. All those factors have led to continuous growth,” he said.
It’s a similar story in other Ontario cities. In London, the benchmark home price was $420,494 in the third quarter. That is 10 per cent higher than the same quarter last year and nearly 20 per cent higher over a two-year period, according to Royal LePage.
In Kingston, the typical home price was $392,209 in the third quarter, a 3-per-cent increase over the previous year and a 17per-cent increase over a two-year period.
Unlike many suburban homeowners, who either commute or work in major job centres such as Toronto and Mississauga, this crop of buyers spends more time working from home, according to Royal LePage chief executive Phil Soper. They seek out smaller, cheaper cities “because of the affordability of living, affordability of housing and the fact that work is portable now,” he said.
Smaller markets have also generated interest from individual property investors such as Ms. Vanditelli and Mr. Harris.
The couple ventured into real estate for another source of income. At the time, Ms. Vanditelli’s employer was laying off her colleagues and the couple feared she would soon lose her job.
The first house they purchased in Niagara Falls was $154,000; the second house was $123,000; the third property, a duplex, was $178,000; the fourth purchase, another duplex, was $203,000; and the fifth property was $145,000.
“We felt that it was a hidden gem that nobody had tapped into at that point,” said Ms. Vanditelli.
“I think we got in at the right time,” she said. The couple now own a café in town.
Government efforts to cool the housing market had no impact on places such as Niagara and Kingston, according to local realtors. When the stricter mortgage rules went into effect in 2018, home sales and house prices declined in Toronto and Vancouver, the country’s most expensive real estate market. But Niagara continued to appreciate.
“We were undervalued for years,” Mr. Johnstone said.
Sarah Larbi, who owns 10 properties in Ontario and runs a real estate investment club, says interest is growing in property investing. The 35-year-old believes St.
Catharines is ripe for investment and shuns expensive areas such as Toronto, Mississauga and Oakville. Her real estate club’s monthly sessions attract upward of 200 people who want to learn more about how and where to invest.

Ottawa should exempt Alberta from mortgage stress test, Kenney says: Premier says ‘unfair’ federal real estate plan works for stronger housing markets

Full text: Alberta Premier Jason Kenney says Ottawa’s mortgage stress test is a solution designed for hot housing markets such as Toronto and Vancouver, and he believes the still-weak Alberta economy deserves an exemption from the process.
The Premier has called it a “prejudicial, regional, unfair” measure that has pushed the dream of home ownership away for some Albertans. He and his ministers have made this argument with their federal counterparts in recent weeks.
It’s clear why Mr. Kenney can make a political argument that the test was designed for other parts of the country. The head of the Canada Housing and Mortgage Corp. (CMHC), Evan Siddall, has bragged that changes to stress-test requirements since 2010 have helped reduce house prices nationally by as much as 3.4 per cent.
That’s a policy win for places such as Vancouver and Toronto, where housing costs have soared and keeping a lid on prices is key.
However, that message is cold comfort in Alberta markets, which don’t need any help with decreasing home prices.
“It’s really been challenging,” says Michael Brodrick, chair of the Realtors Association of Edmonton, who contends the economic situation on the Prairies wasn’t considered when stresstest policies were put in place.
“Real estate is hyper-local.”
But backers of the stress test say its real job is to keep people across the country from piling on too much housing debt they ultimately can’t manage. Household indebtedness is a key risk to the Canadian economy as a whole.
Some argue that’s especially relevant in Alberta and Saskatchewan, where consumer debt is high, and continued weakness in the resource-focused economies means the percentage of mortgages in arrears (where payments haven’t been made for three or more months) is significantly higher than in Ontario, Quebec or British Columbia.
Bob Dugan, chief economist for the CMHC, says higher levels of mortgage arrears in the two provinces “would suggest to me that maybe it is important to continue to be careful about the debts that people take on.”
There are actually two stress tests – one for people who are able to make a 20-per-cent or more down payment on their home (an uninsured mortgage), and one for people whose down payment is less than 20 per cent (an insured mortgage). Respectively, the two tests were put in place by the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, and the federal Finance Minister. Both were created in recent years, and both force borrowers to show they would still be able to make their payments if interest rates went up.
But while both tests have affected the prices of Canadian housing – lowering prices slightly – Mr. Dugan said the purpose of the stress tests is actually to make sure people don’t borrow to the absolute maximum, and can better withstand shocks such as a job loss or an economic slowdown.
But for Alberta, the downturn has already arrived. In Calgary, prices for properties on the detached side of the market have dropped more than 8 per cent since 2014, according to the Calgary Real Estate Board (CREB).
For apartment-style condos, prices have dropped 17 per cent.
There is excess housing supply in the market.
Some realtors and mortgage brokers say Alberta housing markets that have already been hammered by joblessness and a weak economy are being further restrained by the stress tests.
And the provincial UCP government – which has been focused on cutting rules and regulations it says stand in the way of economic recovery – is saying the same, arguing the stress tests are blunt instruments.
“We believe the mortgage stress test is not a tool that is calibrated for Alberta’s housing market and should be targeted to those areas of the country that require interventionist measures,” said Jerrica Goodwin, a spokeswoman for Alberta Treasury Board and Finance.
The province “is seeking an exemption to the mortgage stress test for all mortgages in Alberta, whether they are insured or uninsured.”
Calgary mortgage broker Cory Lewis says she understands why the rules were put in place for Vancouver and Toronto.
“Perhaps areas outside of these overinflated markets could have been subject to slightly looser guidelines,” Ms. Lewis says. “To paint the whole country with the same brush – it just doesn’t make a whole lot of sense.”
In general, the stress test has cut the borrowing power of individuals by more than 20 per cent.
Ms. Lewis says that some of her clients, many households with single incomes, would be approved to purchase condos in the Calgary area but are no longer able to qualify for a home – despite having a down payment, good credit and minimal debt.
Ms. Lewis said she also gets a call or two each week from people who now don’t qualify for their mortgage on their current home – in many cases because they made the purchase before the stress test was in place. Those people are hindered when trying to get a better rate from a different lender because they will need to pass the stress test if they switch.
The stress test has faced criticism from the housing industry across the country, and there are signs the federal government is open to reviewing the matter. In the mandate letter to Bill Morneau on Dec. 13, the Prime Minister asked the Finance Minister to consider recommendations for making the mortgage stress test “more dynamic.”
There may be tweaks, but concern about the accumulation of household debt will remain, and is likely to continue to guide Canadian fiscal policy. The most significant change to Alberta’s housing market will come if economic forecasts for 2020 and the years ahead come to be, and the province’s jobs and investment picture improves.

Full text: GOING GREEN GOT REAL “Climate emergency” is the Oxford English Dictionary Word of the Year, and in the world of fashion and beauty, a growing awareness of the industry’s impact on the planet kickstarted a push to make style more sustainable. Many brands, big and small, are taking action to become more environmentally friendly and ethical, thanks to customer demand.
One standout step forward in 2019 was a shift in how consumers look at the resale market, which reportedly grew 21 times faster than traditional retail, according to retail analytics firm Global Data. Calgary-based online luxury reseller the Upside is expecting to do $2.4-million in sales this year, while Quebec retailer Simons introduced vintage clothing to its offerings.
When it comes to the production of new apparel and cosmetics, brands continued to develop innovative sources of raw materials and packaging with minimal environmental impact. Frank and Oak introduced a sustainable outerwear collection made from recycled plastic, while beauty brands such as Clarins and Burt’s Bees made it their mission to ensure that their packaging was properly recycled, through new initiatives such as a partnership with TerraCycle, a company that comes up with green solutions for hard-to-recycle products.
At Aldo Shoes, 2019 was the culmination of a five-year sustainability initiative, a journey that included a 46-percent decrease in CO2 emissions and phasing out single-use shopping bags in favour of smart shoeboxes. CEO David Bensadoun, whose father founded the Montreal-based company in 1972, describes the past year as a positive step forward, but promises there’s more work to do. “It showed us what we can do and where we’re headed,” he says. “The goal is to continue to innovate, to improve, to challenge our way of working as an organization and others in the industry to be better, to be at the forefront of actual change.”
SHOPPING WENT GOURMET A big shift in shopping habits saw the grocery store become the retail destination of the year and that’s because the modern-day supermarket is anything but banal.
The elevated grocery shopping experience kicked off in January, when McEwan’s Yonge & Bloor opened its 17,000square-foot subterranean spot in downtown Toronto. The thoughtfully stocked aisles of ingredients and pantry staples are surrounded by prepared food options including a Fabbrica Pizza counter, a sushi bar and a carving station.
In November – and one block west – that was followed up by the highly anticipated opening of Canada’s first Eataly outpost, a three-storey temple to Italian cuisine. That month also saw the Time Out Montreal Market opening the doors to its 40,000-square-foot emporium in the Centre Eaton de Montreal on St. Catherine Street. It features food from 16 of the city’s top chefs including James Beard Award winner Normand Laprise of Toqué, a beverage program to complement the dining options, culinary lessons and a retail space.
According to TV food and lifestyle expert and writer Pay Chen, a key factor in the rise of the curated grocery store may be too much choice at the local supermarket. “I think people like to feel like someone has done the work of sifting through the options and choosing the best or most relevant or interesting items,” she says. Chen points out that these curated stores typically come with a staff that’s knowledgeable and approachable, comparing their role to that of a sommelier. “The expertise available makes the experience more enjoyable.”
BRICKS MET CLICKS It wasn’t so long ago that e-commerce threatened to wipe out traditional retail, with casualties that included some legacy brands such as Sears. Despite some highprofile bankruptcies in 2019, including Forever 21 and Barneys New York, this year, it became increasingly apparent that the in-person shopping experience isn’t likely to vanish any time soon.
In fact, it’s become a key strategy for digital natives, the term used to describe companies that were born online. A report by the International Council of Shopping Centers revealed that opening a physical retail space results in a 37 per cent average increase in web traffic. This positive relationship between bricks and clicks is dubbed the “halo effect” and it illustrates the fact that we aren’t strictly online shoppers or in-store shoppers, but a hybrid of both, with the path to purchase becoming increasingly nuanced.
Aly Damji, the executive vice-president of investments and asset management at real estate investment and development firm Hullmark, says it’s a phenomenon he’s witnessed at their properties firsthand. He points to Toronto meal-prep and food delivery service Fresh City Farms as an example of the “omnichannel” approach. “They were online and had a loyal following of their food delivery meal prep kits. Now, they have kits available in store, but then also built a traditional grocery business.”
At malls and in shopping districts across Canada this year, we’ve seen ecommerce leaders including Endy, Knix and Bon Look launching and expanding their storefront presence.
BRAND CANADA CAPITALIZED ON ITS CACHET With the NBA trophy awarded north of the border for the first time ever, all eyes are on Canada. And it’s no longer just for our maple syrup, as high-profile figures including the Duchess of Sussex and Hailey Bieber continue to sport Canadian fashion labels such as Nonie, Aritzia, Sentaler and Ecksand on the world stage.
“The perception of Canadian brands on the international scene has changed a lot,” says Natasha Koifman, president and founder of NKPR, a public-relations firm with offices in Toronto and New York.
“The overall increased global spotlight on our country, as well as our strong identity and values of integrity and inclusiveness have contributed to the increased interest in brands that are created in Canada.”
According to a survey by Price Waterhouse Cooper this year, 96 per cent of international respondents had a positive view of Canada, with 88 per cent of millennial respondents saying they have a strong interest in Canada.
Riding the wave are a handful of Canadian retailers that continued to expand globally this year. Canadian cottage staple Roots opened up its first experiential store on Chicago’s Magnificent Mile. Parka brand Moose Knuckles and CAFA 2018 women’s-wear designer of the year Marie Saint Pierre both opened stores in Manhattan. And jewellery brand Mejuri followed up its New York store with one in Los Angeles.
Of course, no one champions Canada quite like Drake, who marked a major milestone this year when he expanded his empire all the way to Japan with the opening of an impressive OVO flagship store in Tokyo.
CONSUMERS RECOGNIZED THEIR POWER TO AFFECT CHANGE With industry watchdogs such as Instagram’s Diet Prada and Estée Laundry drawing attention to the fashion and beauty industry’s many instances of cultural appropriation, racism, gender discrimination, workplace bullying and egregious environmental waste, these stories became mainstream news with bottom-line consequences.
After popular backlash, Dior pulled the videos from its Sauvage fragrance campaign, which featured Native American imagery; Elle Germany formally apologized for its “Black is Back” story about models of colour; and Gucci’s Alessandro Michele wrote an apology letter for a turtleneck design resembling black face. Loewe removed an outfit from its shelves that resembled a concentration camp uniform, while Kim Kardashian renamed her “Kimono” shapewear line “Skims.”
Sage Paul, a fashion designer and the founder of Indigenous Fashion Week Toronto, cites the recent cancellation of the Victoria’s Secret fashion show as an example of consumer action leading to industry evolution.
“Speaking up and consciously choosing what we consume does have an impact,” she says, adding that social media has opened up the conversation to be more inclusive. “While I think call-out culture has its problems, I do think it’s important to think critically and be accountable for how our choices impact those around us or perpetuate social issues, like racism. With tact, we can influence positive change by drawing attention to those issues and not contributing to them.”
Take the Savage x Fenty Lingerie by Rihanna collection. At the pop star’s fashion show in September, she was applauded for featuring models of all shapes, cultures, orientations, genders and abilities, and the line has become an industry standard for how to build an inclusive brand.

Full text: Li Yonghui is a millionaire many times over, a Chinese-born entrepreneur with a Canadian passport who has previously been jailed, fought accusations of fraudulent accounting and, for the past year, employed dissident tactics to mount a high-profile campaign against local officials cracking down on his company.
Last Friday, his efforts came to a dramatic head, when authorities seized him in Shijiazhuang while he was on a morning walk outside the 52-storey high-rise owned by the company he founded, the U.S.-traded Fincera Inc., which has built a financial technology business lending investors’ money to small and medium enterprises.
It was part of a co-ordinated sweep that, in short order, took down a company that had been held up as a Canadian success story in China. Now, it’s become a particularly vivid example of the potential consequences of doing business in a country where politics holds heavy sway and justice can be delivered bluntly.
Mr. Li has built multiple businesses – in real estate development, truck leasing and small-business lending. But his company, Fincera, prospered in a corner of the Chinese financial world, where other companies have committed major fraud. Fincera denies wrongdoing, but last Friday morning, its servers were abruptly pulled offline.
Police surrounded the company’s headquarters in Shijiazhuang, an industrial centre that is the capital of Hebei province in northern China. About 300 kilometres away in Beijing, dozens of officers descended upon a satellite office, detaining employees from morning until night, preventing them from using their phones and carting away computers and paperwork before loading about 10 people in a bus and driving them to Shijiazhuang.
In the following days, the number of detained employees rose to 38, out of roughly 750 in total. Border authorities have barred Mr. Li’s son, Spencer, who is also Canadian, from leaving the country, accusing him of involvement in illegal financing. (Although diplomatic tensions are high between Canada and China, there is no indication that the allegations against the men are related to their nationality.)
In a statement, Global Affairs Canada spokesman John Babcock said the department “is aware of the detention of a Canadian citizen in Hebei. Consular officials are in contact with local authorities and are providing consular assistance to the individual.” He added: “While Canada cannot control the laws or entry and exit requirements of another country, we hope and expect that Canadians are treated in a fair and transparent manner during their travels.”
What took place at Fincera was “a sudden attack,” said James, whose wife worked in the company’s accounting department and was among those detained. The Globe and Mail is identifying him by his English first name only because of the risk of speaking out in a continuing legal situation.
James was himself among those held by police last Friday, after rushing to the office to inquire about his wife after he stopped hearing from her. He was let go after five hours, urging his wife to “be brave” as he left.
Fincera was founded by Mr. Li, a serial entrepreneur who secured a Canadian passport in 2000, but did his life’s main work in Shijiazhuang, where Fincera’s assets reached nearly $900-million in value, according to company estimates this summer.
His was a career, however, marked by turbulence. Authorities once locked him up for three months when he tried to buy a state-owned hotel, before releasing him without charges.
Later, the company he founded, then called AutoChina International Ltd., came under attack by short-sellers who alleged financial fraud. Nasdaq delisted the company (it’s now traded over the counter) and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission issued market manipulation charges, leading to a US$4.5-million settlement in 2014. AutoChina admitted no wrongdoing.
Mr. Li’s most recent business created a large peer-topeer, or P2P, lending service, a financial structure that involves gathering money from investors and lending it out. Investors receive interest, small businesses obtain working capital and Fincera earns facilitation fees. It’s a model that gained rapid popularity in China over the past decade until a series of high-profile failures, with some companies exposed as Ponzi schemes that had attracted billions of dollars from investors.
Chinese regulators stepped in with a series of new rules in 2016, and by the end of June of this year, 4,748 P2P platforms had vanished. By this December, only 456 remained, according to industry statistics.
Fincera was among those holding on, with Mr. Li, 57, convinced he had made changes necessary to stay onside of the new rules, his son said. Instead, the company found itself increasingly squeezed by local authorities, told to cut its outstanding loans, which total $1.6-billion, by twothirds.
But “we refused to scale down,” Spencer said. “We follow central regulations.” But Spencer said some local leaders are conservative in their outlook and see P2P as tainted and risky. “They don’t want anything to happen on their watch.” Mr. Li has faulted officials in the office of the Shijiazhuang mayor and finance bureau.
In fact, regulators across China are “trying to wind down the entire industry in a gradual and orderly fashion,” said Zhu Ning, an expert on the Chinese economy who is deputy dean at Shanghai Advanced Institute of Finance. The idea is to prevent large well-developed firms “from getting into trouble. The advice is for the platforms to repay their existing obligations and reduce, if not stop, the issuing of new products.”
Fincera, however, sought to stand fast against the tide. Mr. Li adopted the tactics of a dissident. He used a megaphone outside local government offices to broadcast complaints. He posted critical open letters on social media, in which he combined arguments of legal defence with stinging corruption allegations. In one, he accused financial regulators of using well-placed family members to cash in on the industry they are meant to oversee.
Meanwhile, his business grew more difficult. Local authorities asked local P2P companies to voluntarily close down.
When Fincera refused, it began to run into obstacles. It failed in an attempt to move operations to Beijing, blaming interference from local officials. It was unable to raise cash by selling assets – because of local interference, it says. Government offices in Shijiazhuang then refused to process regular business paperwork.
Local officials told Caixin, a Chinese financial publication, that Fincera is a “highrisk institution.” As rumours spread that the company was under scrutiny, its non-repayment rate rose. Government pressure meant people didn’t “have any incentive” to repay, Spencer said.
Then, on Friday, officers descended.
Fincera is accused of illegal acceptance of public funds. The company called the allegations “without merit,” saying it “vehemently disagrees with the investigation.”
Statements from authorities, however, suggest “there’s very little chance the company will be reopened. I think investors will suffer some losses,” Prof. Zhu said. The company counts 26,117 borrowers and 77,172 lenders, Caixin reported.
“My dad didn’t really have to fight the government,” Spencer argued. Mr. Li simply wanted to support those who counted on his company, his son said. “He could have thrown in the towel, said, ‘I quit,’ and leave all our borrowers and customers hanging. It would have been fine. It would have been legal.”

Developers make the most of what history has to offer: In Winnipeg and across Canada, builders accentuate the best of the past to lure in workers of the future

Full text: The Johnston Terminal Building in the Forks District of Winnipeg has long been a part of the city’s industrial history, and it’s now destined to become a part of its postindustrial digital future.
It’s a property whose purpose has come in from the cold – quite literally. Constructed in 1929, the four-storey brick warehouse functioned as a cold-storage railway terminal before its first renovation in 1993. Today, this iconic building, in the middle of one of the most popular pedestriangathering areas in the Forks, will soon be a new home for Amazon Web Services (AWS).
First founded as an Indigenous settlement and with a history dating back more than 6,000 years, the Forks is named for its location, right at the junction where the Assiniboine and Red Rivers meet. A crossroads for Canada’s transcontinental railway and the fur trade, throughout history the region has witnessed the Industrial Age and welcomed waves of immigration.
Now, Amazon will be taking up residence, along with recent acquisition Thinkbox Software, a company founded in 2010 by Winnipegger and chief executive Christopher Bond, that supplies visual effects for film and video.
“When we were acquired by AWS, it just made sense to stay here. We have the talent and the know-how, but it’s also important to have a workspace that can attract new talent,” says Mr. Bond, whose tech tools have been used in Transformers: Dark of the Moon, Thor, Green Lantern, Harry Potter and Avatar, as well as videos and commercials.
AWS will occupy 13,000square-feet in the Johnston building, mirroring the continuing trend of smaller, less central cities seeking – and acquiring – major tech tenants. After gobbling up historic buildings in major centres such as downtown Toronto, San Francisco and elsewhere, developers and planners are discovering the virtues of older buildings in lesser-known areas that still have that all-important “cool” factor.
As the ideal bait for luring skilled millennial and Generation Z knowledge workers away from the bright lights of the GTA or Silicon Valley, companies are happy to pay less for leasing or purchasing such properties; for young workers, it’s the appeal of more affordable housing, shorter commutes but still gain access to exciting, well-paying employment.
For example, in Charlottesville, Va., (population 48,000) a fast-growing tech company is spending US$21-million to renovate and lease 85,000 square feet in a factory that once churned out scratchy wool U.S. Navy uniforms on land once owned by Thomas Jefferson.
The challenges can be both physical and regulatory, explains Brian Roy, the local developer responsible for converting the site, locally known as the Woolen Mills factory.
For one thing, the Charlottesville building is 118 years old – meaning the wiring, lighting, ductwork, structural integrity and everything else must be brought up to 21st-century standards, Mr. Roy says.
At the same time, heritage restrictions imposed by the city of Charlottesville are standing in the way of modern environmental and sustainability renovations that are considered indispensable, both for withstanding climate change and for attracting young, skilled workers.
“We looked closely at putting in solar panels for electricity, but it’s a heritage building and we’re operating under rules as [to] what we can do to physically alter the building for at least five years,” Mr. Roy says. “After that, we’ll see.”
“It isn’t easy but it’s where our workers want to be,” says Tobias Dengel, CEO of WillowTree, Inc., a provider of digital software enhancements to such major clients as National Geographic, HBO and Fox Sports.
In Winnipeg, because the Johnston building had already been redone in the 1990s, such hurdles were not as prevalent.
Nevertheless, converting any legacy building generally comes with all kinds of challenges, says Lyndsay Jones, vice-president, property management with Artis REIT, which manages the terminal building.
“These requirements often involve more time and increased cost,” Ms. Jones says. The Forks North Portage Partnership, which oversees the Winnipeg area, “has very stringent archeological requirements to which all service providers must adhere. It can be particularly challenging in an older building [such as the Johnston Terminal], particularly when it comes to excavating for new fibre lines.”
She adds: “Any changes to the building exterior have to be approved both by the Forks North Portage Partnership and by the City of Winnipeg. On the interior, we’ve tried to maintain as much of the original character of the building as possible. When designing tenant spaces, every attempt is made to highlight these features, such as exposed brick, and open ceilings so that the timbers are visible.”
According to Kate Fenske, chief executive for the area’s business association, Downtown Winnipeg, protecting the heritage of structures such as the Johnston Terminal Building and areas such as the Forks is important because these sites become magnets for jobs, retail and tourism.
“The Forks has been a destination for more than 20 years. People want a place to go to, and that’s important when you look at the core of the city and how the downtown competes with the suburbs to attract people,” Ms. Fenske says.
“The Johnston Terminal already has places within the building to get a bite to eat and to shop.
Adding a place where people work adds another dimension – it really helps create that livework-play space,” Ms. Fenske says. Both Ms. Jones in Winnipeg and Mr. Roy in Virginia agree that it’s important to provide office space that is somehow both retro and modern at the same time.
Despite its lack of sustainability features, the Charlottesville former mill features a penthouse meeting room that invites abundant sunlight and opens onto a balcony facing the city, including views of the hill where Jefferson’s Monticello estate is located.
“He’s still watching us,” Mr. Roy says.
In Winnipeg, the developers also paid close attention to the wants and needs of modern workers while respecting the past, Ms. Jones says.
“Fortunately, the building lends itself to large open spaces.
There are windows along the entire exterior perimeter of the building, which allow for beautiful river and city views.”
Ms. Jones adds: “The open workspace concept allows light to be drawn into the space, which creates an inviting environment for workers. Due to the architectural features of the building, such as timber columns and brick-bearing walls in an open concept layout, these features can be accentuated and become a design feature, instead of something hidden behind drywall.”
Getting to and from work is easier in a mid-sized town, Mr. Bond and Mr. Roy agree, especially with both buildings being centrally located.
“You can ride your bike to work,” Mr. Bond says – perhaps subconsciously overlooking the extreme winter weather that Winnipeg is known for.

Full text: Government policies aimed at reducing speculation in Vancouver’s property market have worked to curb foreign buying and speculative demand.
That was merely Part 1, says highprofile immigration lawyer and analyst, Richard Kurland, who’s been studying the impact of those policies.
“Part 1 was putting the machine together,” Mr. Kurland says.
“Part 2 is using the machine to go after tax evaders in the Vancouver property market. At the end of the day, we are going to know who owns what, and for every year. We never had that capability before.”
For 2020, he says we should expect to see those policies put to use to flush out buyers that have been failing to declare global income, as well as speculators who’ve been dodging their fair share of capital gains tax. Speculative buying in recent years has driven up prices for local incomeearners and shut them out of the market.
But the new collection of income tax data and identification of property ownership allows government to cross-reference with Canada Revenue Agency, Mr. Kurland says. The data, combined with recent changes to Quebec’s Immigrant Investor Program (QIIP), will have the effect of softening Vancouver’s high-end property market even further, the Vancouver-based lawyer says.
He adds that we shouldn’t expect another wave of buyers from Hong Kong who might be seeking refuge from current conflicts with Beijing.
Mr. Kurland says that people holding high-end properties who haven’t been transparent about worldwide income may choose to unload those properties instead of face an audit, bringing more supply onto the market.
“That’s how you get these multimillion-dollar homes that are barely occupied,” he says.
“Under the old way, if you had six of them, you declare each one as your personal residence. For each one you say, ‘I’m resident here for income tax purposes and I don’t have to pay capital gains,’ when in fact, none of the above is true.
They are not income tax residents, so they [are not allowed] a capital gains exemption and it’s not their principal residence. But no one checked. It was an honour system. But no longer.
“So the multiple property holds are now all subject to this new game. Their choice now is, ‘How do I unravel my holdings without taking a bath?’ ” The move that has had the biggest effect on regaining control of B.C.’s property market has been the province’s Speculation and Vacancy Tax (SVT), Mr. Kurland says. He calls it a ”triple play.” The tax will continue to play a crucial role because it collects information on whether the property owner is a resident of Canada, if they are paying any income tax here and if they are using a property as a principal residence. In the past, declarations were based on the honour system. A multiple property owner could say that they were the principal resident of each of their properties and claim the capital gains tax exemption, he says. However, the SVT declaration form, which includes a trove of useful information, such as social insurance numbers, is a game-changer, according to Mr. Kurland and other policy experts.
With tax residency information in hand, and all of a person’s property addresses available, those owners can no longer claim principal residency for each property.
As well, Mr. Kurland says, government now has the capability to look back several years into a property owner’s record and question them on previous declarations about principal residency.
“Here is the thing: Now that it’s possible to engage in data matching and run enforcement algorithms by CRA [Canadian Revenue Agency], we now enter the era of the audit for Vancouver property. It’s big,” he says.
In September, the provincial government announced that the tax was clearly working to curb speculation. It had generated $115-million so far, with twothirds of those taxpayers classified as foreign owners and satellite families.
Mr. Kurland also gives the City of Vancouver kudos for its Empty Homes Tax, which will go from 1 per cent on empty homes to 1.25 per cent next year. The city has pulled in about $40-million in revenues from the tax and Mr. Kurland says those are just the people who got caught in the first year.
Other new policies this year will also impact Vancouver, he says.
“At the same time, you have had a shutdown of intake of new immigrant investor cases from Quebec. They paused the whole program for a year.”
The federal government cancelled its immigrant investor program (IIP) in 2014 after determining that it wasn’t of benefit to Canada. The idea was to attract wealthy business people from abroad to invest in Canada, allowing wealthy immigrants to apply for permanent residency in exchange for handing over an interest-free, five-year loan of $800,000 to the government.
However, Quebec continued to run its own IIP, requiring loans of $1.2-million in exchange for permanent residency. And although the applicants are supposed to settle in Quebec, data overwhelmingly show they are using the program as a back door to Vancouver and Toronto. Mr. Kurland found that at least 95 per cent of the applicants were residing outside of Quebec.
The Quebec program is now on pause until next July. There is a backlog of around 20,000 people awaiting their applications for permanent residency to be processed. With heightened concern that the vast majority of applicants are not remaining in Quebec, Mr. Kurland says applicants are now facing new scrutiny, such as whether they own property, or have relatives elsewhere in Canada.
Although it was expected, another major boost to housing policy this year was the province’s win against a class action suit that claimed the tax discriminated against Asian immigrants and was unconstitutional. Simon Fraser University director of the City Program, Andy Yan, submitted a report on behalf of the province. He cited the global wealth phenomenon that drives property prices around the world and the negative impact it has on local citizens. As a consequence, the price of housing, he says in the report, has decoupled from local incomes. Justice Gregory Bowden ruled in favour of the provincial government.
It’s an important precedent for a tax that is gaining favour, Prof.
Yan says. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau campaigned on a promise to launch a 1-per-cent surtax on homes owned by non-resident non-Canadians.
Josh Gordon is an assistant professor at the School of Public Policy at Simon Fraser University, and he too has been a long-time advocate of regulation around foreign buying. As a policy analyst, he is a fan of both the foreign buyer tax and the SVT because of the impacts those taxes had on the market, and also because the SVT, in particular, forces transparency of tax residency.
Now, he wants to see the tax revised so that properties that are owned by foreign owners or satellite families are not exempt if they contain secondary suites.
Currently, foreign property owners can claim exemption if they have a secondary suite on the property rented out.
“That exemption should be eliminated,” Dr. Gordon says.
“The purpose of the tax was to discourage foreign ownership and to encourage those who own based on foreign income or wealth to pay their fair share of taxes. The purpose of the speculation component of the tax wasn’t to create foreign landlords, or satellite families [that have] secondary suites.”
Dr. Gordon says that the introduction of the SVT correlates with a sharp turnaround in the market, so it appears to have had an impact. He wants that impact to continue.
“The concern now is that with some of these exemptions existing, will people who want to skirt the purposes of the tax be able to? And if that’s the case, then the effectiveness of the tax will diminish.”
As to whether Hong Kong’s conflict with Beijing could cause passport holders in that city to return to Vancouver – and trigger another wave of property buying – Mr. Kurland doesn’t see it happening any time soon. He examined applications from Hong Kong for different kinds of sponsorships, work permits and study permits, and he couldn’t find any increases in people applying for entry.
“It was zero, across the board, and the data was as current as September,” he says. “I was flabbergasted. They are not coming.
They aren’t even applying to come here.”

Full text: 14405 8th Concession SCHOMBERG, ONT.
Asking Price: $2,389,000 Taxes: $5,436.61 (2019) Lot Size: 350 feet by 150 feet Agents: Lynda Laceby, roker, Laceby Real Estate Ltd.
THE BACKSTORY Ontario’s King Township is a real estate market of extremes: Dotted among the rolling hills and small towns are houses and condominiums in the submillion price range, but there are also a large number of estate homes on significant acreage running between $4-million and $10-million (and above).
Patrick and Shannon Cian, a duo of interior designers who moved to the township several years ago to find space for a growing family, have found their latest project sits somewhere in the middle of these extremes. Its 1.2 acres is sizable for those used to even large suburban lots, but not the 10 to 30 acres the area’s wellheeled mansion-builders covet.
The house has been thoroughly renovated and is an elegant example of contemporary country living (lots of wood and light, but not too farmhouse-cute). Its combined living space is around 4,000 square feet (if you include the updated basement), which is a step away from the 10,000 square feet (and above) typical of the sprawling mansions occupied by the region’s multimillionaires.
“It has everything you need, but it’s not that crazy McMansion, and not 8,000 square feet of cleaning,” said Mrs. Cian, who acknowledges that the house has been on the market with one price reduction since August.
“You see a lot of really monstrous new builds that are so huge, those are sitting on the market too.”
“We’re pushing it a bit; if it had been on 10 acres, it would have gone,” said listing agent Lynda Laceby, who says King is still a bit of a tough market. There are locals, she says, who have been keeping an eye on the house as they try to sell their own. It’s not the kind of market where you buy a house and hope you can sell.
“It’s the perfect retirement home for someone who doesn’t want to move into town,” she said.
A Google satellite view of the area shows a lot of big houses in the middle of a big parcel with a long laneway, the kind of thing you can’t see from the road.
Ms. Laceby, who helped the Cians buy their first home (and spotted this one, too) represents a lot of high-end clients who make their living in Toronto but want to live away from hustle and bustle. She drops hints about former Toronto Maple Leafs players whose mansions she sold after they recently moved out of town, or of a Maple Leafs Sports and Entertainment executive who moved from Arizona some years ago (the snow made his wife cry, apparently).
At the end of 8th Concession are also two stables where a lot of Toronto’s equestrians rent a stall, making the area with its kilometres of trails a popular spot for riding. Another neighbour who lives on an unpaved road (and was unable to overcome the horsey set’s objections to his proposal to pave more) has a special “toy box” trailer truck that he loads his Maserati supercar (one of many vehicles) on in order to ferry it past the harmful gravel down to the highway where he leaves his “toy box” on the shoulder so he can go cruise in style.
After committing to a king’s ransom on renovations (the roof had to come off, the basement was dug out, a new garage was added – quite a bit more than just updating the interiors) the couple began with the intention of moving in, child No. 4 changed their plans. Suddenly, three-plus one bedrooms just wasn’t enough. So, after buying the house in 2018 for $949,000 they are hoping their investment property property – which they have never lived in – can earn them a tidy return.
THE HOUSE TODAY Local legend has it the site was originally one of the area’s early schoolhouses, but there’s no sign of that now. What you see coming up the drive is a long ranch-style bungalow framed by two wings with peaked roofs (one is the new extra-tall garage that Mr. Cian says can accommodate a carstacker, an essential for the auto buffs of King Township) separated by a covered porch. There’s a big, beefy custom-made porch swing, too.
The front door is framed by narrow windows on all three sides. In addition to adding light there’s an architectural motive for those windows that becomes clear once you step inside. To the right of the front foyer is a powder room and a set of extra-tall antique doors (sourced from Egypt). In order for more standard doors to match those antiques, dormer windows were added in this space, and on the front it made sense to extend the frame. There’s a lot of antique wood in the house; there are weathered beams used as decoration on the entryway to the kitchen and elsewhere on ceilings.
“They bring in warmth,” Mrs. Cian said. “We love any of these objects with a texture and a story; we love the energy embodied in those pieces.
“We met someone who reclaims barns and old wood pieces,” Mr. Cain said. “The beams came from a barn in Innisfil [Ont.].” To the left of the front door is a sitting area with a stonefaced fireplace and the stairs to the downstairs basement are directly ahead.
The kitchen was relocated to the centre of the house (the original layout was more bisected, with one half dedicated to an inlaw suite) and now commands a central view of the rear yard. The kitchen has a few dedicated zones: the preparation area with the sink and stove features open shelving instead of full cabinet uppers on walls covered in white subway tile. A huge island sits in the middle of this space (with lathe-turned posts giving it just a little rustic charm) and mixed pantry/hutch/kitchen office is snugged in the half-wall between two entryways. A large pantry and fridge cabinet (there is another pantry off the kitchen that shares space with the laundry room on the way to the garage/ workshop) separates this from the dining table and one of three of walkout doors to the rear deck and stone patio. More of those decorative beams line the ceiling in the kitchen and this space (decorative because the new roof is a truss, and these are not structural “exposed” beams).
“Every house we’ve owned, we’ve redone and renovated – we’ve done a few other projects in Caledon – this one is kind of a unique one,” Mr. Cian said. “Our design goal … was to meet our standards. We weren’t designing it to flip it. We chose high-end fixtures that spoke to us.” Such as the 48-inch Bertazzoni double oven, six-burner and griddle range (these run anywhere between $6,000 and $9,000).
Mrs. Cian’s brother, Steve Moschenross (Straightline Construction) pitched in with a lot of work, which included a new well, new septic system, new HVAC (propane-fuelled forced-air furnace), the new roof and reconfiguring a lot of rooms. They estimate they spent close to $1-million on upgrades.
Off the rear doors is an outdoor dining space with new pergola.
The lot is longer than it is deep and the small barn/shed outbuilding is out of the way behind the garage. There is an attached workshop on the back of the house.
Back inside, next to this dining room area is another sitting room, with a second set of doors to the deck and an antique fireplace mantle. The hallway to the master suite is off this room.
At the foot of the basement stairs is an expansive media room with built-in entertainment centre wall to the right. Around the corner is a large games room, with a pool table and filled with wine racks, that could convert to a full gym. There’s also a sizable
office that sits under the master suite and has several at-grade windows for light.
There are three bedrooms upstairs – two in the wing next to the family room, one on the garage side – and one in the basement. The two smaller upstairs bedrooms are 10 feet by 9 feet, both with custom built-ins and more beams. There are two full bathrooms for the non-master bedrooms, one upstairs, one in the basement.
The master suite is 18 feet by 12 feet and faces the road, with windows on two walls (the inner window doubles as a Juliet balcony that looks onto the front porch).
There’s a walk-in closet/dead-end hall here, and the master ensuite is Mrs. Cian’s favourite upgrade.
BEST FEATURE For Mrs. Cian, the goal with the master ensuite was to create a spa. The tiles are hexagonal, the walls are shiplap wood, the fixtures Hans Grohe. The vanity was made from reclaimed wood (the same source for the beams). The walk-in shower is vast, the freestanding soaker tub is deep, there’s a varnished tree stump for a stool.
Both bathrooms on the floor feature a glass-cabinet hutch for storage, which is an interesting way to manage all the bath bombs, oils and ointments a modern self-care regimen requires.
“The sparkle of the carpet inlay, that big skylight, it’s full of light … it makes me feel like I’m on holiday,” Mrs. Cian said.

Charity, builder create inclusive housing: L’Arche Toronto works with Daniels Corp. to create a nine-bedroom apartment for people with intellectual disabilities

Full text: THE LISTING
Over the past two years, Daniels Corp. has been working on something special for one of its condominium towers in the third phase of Regent Park’s redevelopment: a massive nine-bedroom apartment designed to meet the assisted-living needs of the charity L’Arche, which provides housing for people with intellectual disabilities.
According to Raphael Arens, executive director of L’Arche Toronto, condominiums can be an ideal location for the integration of vulnerable communities, but the key is getting in the door with a developer before a building’s plans are already finished and ready for presale.
“The challenge of developers is every level looks the same: we didn’t want to have six apartments, we want one apartment with separate rooms for members as well those who support them and live with them,” Mr. Arens said.
L’Arche, a network of communities for the intellectually disabled, was founded by the late philosopher and theologian Jean Vanier and now operates in 38 countries. Thirty of L’Arche’s 154 communities are in Canada.
The L’Arche community of Greater Vancouver also has a building plan underway – an ambitious $30-million facility in Burnaby, B.C., that would provide housing for people with and without disabilities.
In Toronto, L’Arche houses 21 members, who live full-time with several assistants, in four detached houses in residential neighbourhoods in east Toronto.
With Daniels, L’Arche Toronto is hoping to find homes for five members and three live-in staff in the upcoming Artworks Tower at 130 River St.
It’s not just a matter of buying several apartments and connecting them. The ability to carve out common spaces, to make the best use of the 3,500 square feet in the floorplan and to keep that financially viable is what requires preplanning. “This can’t be done midway through construction,” said Jake Cohen, vice-president of project implementation at Daniels.
The project is a first for Daniels, and in a way it springs from Mr. Cohen’s own work at making Daniels buildings more accessible.
Mr. Cohen started in a customer -ervice role with Daniels and often fielded calls from new residents asking if there was anything that could be done to an apartment to make a little more manageable for residents with mobility issues.
“I spent three or four years collecting a lot of these phone calls and it struck me as this is a real issue – they are struggling to live in these places,” Mr. Cohen said. “So, I created a checklist, and I thought, wouldn’t it be easier to incorporate some of these features into our designs up front?” Some of the issues are almost head-slappers: The company was designing balconies with a huge step to get out to them. Not only was that a tripping hazard, but it made the balconies totally inaccessible to someone in a wheelchair. The answer was to design a lower threshold. Other things, such as a more accessible height for receptacles and switches, better clearance and turning areas in bathrooms, wider doorways and corridors, even door-openers in common areas went beyond industry standards.
Mr. Arens heard Mr. Cohen talk about some of Daniels’s designs at a conference to connect developmental service providers with home-builders. “After the meeting, I just said to him: ‘I need to talk to you about an idea.’” After that first meeting, Mr. Cohen and Daniels met with L’Arche again and again, spending months to flesh out the concept and refine the idea.
Hot real estate markets don’t just create barriers for millenials looking to get on the property ladder; non-profits and other housing providers struggle to find affordable land or housing for their unique needs, too. A single-floor design has become an important goal for L’Arche, as some of its aging members are finding stairs in their existing houses a difficulty.
Initially, L’Arche hoped to build a ranch bungalow, but land prices in Toronto are prohibitive, and that’s when they started looking at multi-family residences.
As Mr. Cohen said, this will be a market-rate condo (which in downtown Toronto will mean close to $1,000 a square foot), and L’Arche hopes to raise $3.8-million to purchase and furnish the space. It’s not cheap, but there are a lot of advantages too.
“The key for Raphael and Daniels was more integration and not segregation,” Mr. Cohen said.
“Those in the L’Arche unit will have access to all the building amenities – that was really a big sell for L’Arche.”
In addition to the opportunity for more social interaction, the building comes pre-equipped with security and there’s no need to worry about furnaces or any other mechanical issues a detached house comes with. Plus, Regent Park is an amenity-rich neighbourhood with strong local programming. “It’s a very important piece to be part of that community,” Mr. Arens said. “I think we have something to offer.”
Condos are often a more affordable option for home buyers, and with a waiting list for assisted housing topping 14,000 people in Ontario – and more than 4,000 in Toronto – Mr. Arens thinks more organizations similar to his could make a similar move.
“It could be a blueprint,” he says. “It’s important to recognize you can build this not just for our sector.”
Daniels, which has done projects with Habitat for Humanity, is also open to requests. “We’re looking for other opportunities for affordable living partnerships,” Mr. Cohen said.
“We want to build more, but we are a small organization,” Mr. Arens said. “For me, it’s important to break down that barrier. We need to start working with developers and architects. There are more people recognizing there’s a market here.”

Full text: DONE DEAL 47 Buckskin Way, Cochrane, Alta.
COCHRANE Asking price: $399,000 Selling price: $386,000 Taxes: $1,718 (2018) Days on the market: 67 Listing agents: Bryon Howard and Shirley Wright, Re/Max House of Real Estate
THE ACTION This two-year-old house in the town of Cochrane, about 45 minutes west of Calgary, was a challenge to sell with a railway line behind the backyard and builders adding new inventory nearby. But the asking price of $399,000 – less than the local average home price of $420,000 – resulted in a strong turnout of 15 buyers, including many from Calgary. Negotiations produced an eventual purchase price of $386,000.
“Fifty per cent of everything listed there was not selling,” agent Bryon Howard said.
“It was in really good condition and the owners had moved out, but left some of the furniture, which was set strategically to stage it a little, so that helped.”
WHAT THEY GOT The two-storey house on a 33-foot-by-110-foot lot provides 1,759 square feet of living space, an unfinished basement and an attached double garage.
Ceilings rise nine feet above the living and dining rooms, as well as the kitchen, which also features a large island, granite counters and stainless steel appliances.
Upstairs, a family room and laundry facilities are located amid three bedrooms, including one with an en suite bathroom.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “Cochrane is booming. It has tripled in size in the last 12 to 15 years, and it has everything now: beautiful mountain views to townhouses to condos to single-family homes,” Mr. Howard said. “This is a very typical two-storey, detached home of moderate size.”

Full text: L’Arche Toronto works with Daniels Corp. to create a nine-bedroom apartment for people with intellectual disabilities SHANE DINGMAN REAL ESTATE REPORTER TORONTO THE LISTING Over the past two years, Daniels Corp. has been working on something special for one of its condominium towers in the third phase of Regent Park’s redevelopment: a massive nine-bedroom apartment designed to meet the assisted-living needs of the charity L’Arche, which provides housing for people with intellectual disabilities.
According to Raphael Arens, executive director of L’Arche Toronto, condominiums can be an ideal location for the integration of vulnerable communities, but the key is getting in the door with a developer before a building’s plans are already finished and ready for presale.
“The challenge of developers is every level looks the same: we didn’t want to have six apartments, we want one apartment with separate rooms for members as well those who support them and live with them,” Mr. Arens said.
L’Arche, a network of communities for the intellectually disabled, was founded by the late philosopher and theologian Jean Vanier and now operates in 38 countries. Thirty of L’Arche’s 154 communities are in Canada.
The L’Arche community of Greater Vancouver also has a building plan underway – an ambitious $30-million facility in Burnaby, B.C., that would provide housing for people with and without disabilities.
In Toronto, L’Arche houses 21 members, who live full-time with several assistants, in four detached houses in residential neighbourhoods in east Toronto.
With Daniels, L’Arche Toronto is hoping to find homes for five members and three live-in staff in the upcoming Artworks Tower at 130 River St.
It’s not just a matter of buying several apartments and connecting them. The ability to carve out common spaces, to make the best use of the 3,500 square feet in the floorplan and to keep that financially viable is what requires preplanning. “This can’t be done midway through construction,” said Jake Cohen, vicepresident of project implementation at Daniels.
The project is a first for Daniels, and in a way it springs from Mr. Cohen’s own work at making Daniels buildings more accessible.
Mr. Cohen started in a customer-service role with Daniels and often fielded calls from new residents asking if there was anything that could be done to an apartment to make a little more manageable for residents with mobility issues.
“I spent three or four years collecting a lot of these phone calls and it struck me as this is a real issue – they are struggling to live in these places,” Mr. Cohen said. “So, I created a checklist, and I thought, wouldn’t it be easier to incorporate some of these features into our designs up front?” Some of the issues are almost head-slappers: The company was designing balconies with a huge step to get out to them. Not only was that a tripping hazard, but it made the balconies totally inaccessible to someone in a wheelchair. The answer was to design a lower threshold. Other things, such as a more accessible height for receptacles and switches, better clearance and turning areas in bathrooms, wider doorways and corridors, even door-openers in common areas went beyond industry standards.
Mr. Arens heard Mr. Cohen talk about some of Daniels’s designs at a conference to connect developmental service providers with home-builders. “After the meeting, I just said to him: ‘I need to talk to you about an idea.’” After that first meeting, Mr. Cohen and Daniels met with L’Arche again and again, spending months to flesh out the concept and refine the idea.
Hot real estate markets don’t just create barriers for millenials looking to get on the property ladder; non-profits and other housing providers struggle to find affordable land or housing for their unique needs, too. A single-floor design has become an important goal for L’Arche, as some of its aging members are finding stairs in their existing houses a difficulty. Initially, L’Arche hoped to build a ranch bungalow, but land prices in Toronto are prohibitive, and that’s when they started looking at multi-family residences.
As Mr. Cohen said, this will be a market-rate condo (which in downtown Toronto will mean close to $1,000 a square foot), and L’Arche hopes to raise $3.8million to purchase and furnish the space. It’s not cheap, but there are a lot of advantages too.
“The key for Raphael and Daniels was more integration and not segregation,” Mr. Cohen said.
“Those in the L’Arche unit will have access to all the building amenities – that was really a big sell for L’Arche.”
In addition to the opportunity for more social interaction, the building comes pre-equipped with security and there’s no need to worry about furnaces or any other mechanical issues a detached house comes with. Plus, Regent Park is an amenity-rich neighbourhood with strong local programming. “It’s a very important piece to be part of that community,” Mr. Arens said. “I think we have something to offer.”
Condos are often a more affordable option for home buyers, and with a waiting list for assisted housing topping 14,000 people in Ontario – and more than 4,000 in Toronto – Mr. Arens thinks more organizations similar to his could make a similar move.
“It could be a blueprint,” he says. “It’s important to recognize you can build this not just for our sector.”
Daniels, which has done projects with Habitat for Humanity, is also open to requests. “We’re looking for other opportunities for affordable living partnerships,” Mr. Cohen said.
“We want to build more, but we are a small organization,” Mr. Arens said. “For me, it’s important to break down that barrier.
We need to start working with developers and architects. There are more people recognizing there’s a market here.”

Plan to restrict density on Queen West might soon unfold: At a time when people are clamouring for housing, the city is proposing limitations to development on a strip of the popular street

Full text: Toronto is on the verge of unveiling a sweeping proposal to restrict density on a long stretch of Queen Street West, the key downtown strip that for decades has showcased the city’s most eclectic art, music and fashion.
Queen has long been an urban magnet, its appeal surviving changes in consumer tastes and an increasingly gentrified city.
But those same pressures – including the westward march of chain stores – have also changed the street. A new staff report focused on balancing preservation with change is expected within weeks, and at least one major developer is concerned that the proposed solution is too restrictive.
The plan will cover the part of Queen between Bathurst and Roncesvalles, a 3.5-kilometre strip that takes in West Queen West and the former Parkdale Village, establishing new zoning policies while also seeking to protect the area under heritage rules.
According to a draft city document, new and renovated buildings would be limited to six storeys, up to 20 metres in total, with the first three storeys allowed adjacent to the sidewalk and the remainder set back. But the proposals go further, including design guidelines and a slate of changes – around pedestrian mobility, road safety, parking requirements and landscaping – that get to the heart of neighbourhood livability.
“There is a certain feel for pedestrians walking along Queen … and your building form has to reinforce that feel,” said city Councillor Gord Perks, whose ward includes the westernmost part of the area. “So the overall height [limit] isn’t the only thing we’re trying to capture. It’s the pedestrian experience, the look, the rhythm of doors.”
Mr. Perks said that protection is necessary because the booming real estate market is threatening the area. He argues that the plan would still allow change, as long as it is modestly scaled and enhances what is already there.
But one of the most prominent faces of Toronto’s condo boom says the city would be shirking its duty to facilitate more housing.
“I would not advocate the wiping out of the charm of the Parkdale Village,” developer Brad Lamb said. “But I think we have to pick our spots where we’re going to allow density, and we should allow more density [rather] than less density.”
Queen Street dates to the 18th century and has gone through multiple evolutions.
Housing replaced farms. A college east of Ossington decamped and the site eventually became Trinity Bellwoods Park. The factories gradually closed. By the later 20th century, Queen Street was a counterculture destination, the hipsters following later.
While Queen remains a popular place to skate, paint graffiti and hang out – a grittier retail strip than Bloor Street – the gentrification pressure has been rising in recent decades, particularly east of Bathurst.
The Horseshoe Tavern, a legendary live-music site, is now flanked by a MAC cosmetics store and a fast-food outlet. Another old-school watering hole and venue, the Beverley Tavern, which helped launch the band Martha and the Muffins, became a boutique hotel.
Change has not been as profound farther west, the area the city is seeking to protect. Although the appliance-repair outlets have gradually disappeared, and there are growing numbers of international brands and coffee outlets, independent retailers maintain a stronger presence.
Robert Sysak, neighbourhood director of the business improvement area for West Queen West, says this area is helped by the narrowness of its typical lots.
Their scale makes it harder to assemble land for a large store, for example, or a condo development. The galleries for which this stretch was once famed have dwindled, though, as rents rose.
Farther west again, historic Parkdale has a similar scale, with a streetscape featuring a wide range of commercial uses. There is also a greater presence of marginalized people, which has helped spur neighbourhood pushback against gentrification, development and particularly the conversion of rooming houses to private residences.
Development pressure has been building on western Queen Street, which has long been included in the city’s “Avenues plan” aimed at encouraging midrise density on key arteries.
As an avenue, developers could be reasonably sure of getting approval for eight storeys, and likely to ask for 10 to 15. However, West Queen West and Parkdale never had their own areaspecific zoning and development has been erratic. Taller buildings were approved in some spots while height was more strictly limited elsewhere.
City staff have been crafting a formal approach for this area as it weighs the desire for development against an interest in preservation.
Among the dozens of tactics being proposed are maximizing the repurposing potential of old buildings by not requiring additional parking when their use changes, discouraging the consolidation of property lots and encouraging the retention of existing live-music venues. Queen Street itself “will be modified over time … prioritizing the safe and efficient movement of pedestrians, cyclists and transit.”
The full suite of proposals is expected to go before the local community council early next month, and then to full city council. While any new rules would remain subject to appeal at the province’s Local Planning Appeal Tribunal, enshrining them in a formal planning document could help strengthen the city’s hand before that tribunal.
Mr. Perks said there is no desire to freeze the area in time. He points to a glass addition on an early 20th-century library a few kilometres north, on Bloor Street, as the sort of change that can enhance a building without mimicking its historic form.
But Mr. Lamb says the development economics won’t work under the new rules for western Queen, arguing that this is an attempt by planning staff to stop any change.
“You can’t buy a three-storey and renovate it and add three floors and make any money,” he said. “They know those buildings will never sell, and they’ll just lock down [this area] forever at three storeys.”

Anti-money laundering agency flags bank drafts in casino dealings

Full text: Canada’s anti-money laundering agency is warning casinos to carefully eye customers who pay for their gambling with bank drafts – the latest method of choice for criminals trying to disguise dirty money.
The federal Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada, known as Fintrac, says in an operational alert issued today that cash is falling out of favour in illicit casino transactions because of intense media and government scrutiny.
Instead, criminals are opting for the liquidity and quasi-anonymity of bank drafts, Fintrac’s recent analysis of suspicious casino-related transactions shows.
Professional money launderers are constantly adapting their methods, Fintrac director Nada Semaan said in an interview.
“They will always be looking at different ways to do it, and our job is to be a step ahead of them and figure that out,” she said. “We can’t stop everybody, but we are working extremely hard on this and we are committed to doing more.”
Fintrac tries to zero in on cash linked to terrorism and money laundering by sifting through millions of pieces of information annually from banks, insurance companies, securities dealers, money service businesses, real estate brokers, casinos and others.
Over all, the centre disclosed 2,276 pieces of intelligence to police and security agencies such as the RCMP and Canadian Security Intelligence Service last year.
Fintrac is publishing the latest alert as part of Project Athena, an RCMP-led public-private partnership aimed at disrupting money-laundering activity in British Columbia and across Canada.
The effort is modelled on previous initiatives targeting the fentanyl trade, romance fraud and human trafficking.
Based on the reports it has received, Fintrac suspects many of the people involved in suspicious casino-related transactions were money mules who moved crime proceeds, wittingly or unwittingly, on behalf of a money launderer.
The first type commonly reported their occupation as “student” or simply “unemployed,” the alert says. “Their bank accounts demonstrated in-andout activity, with a high volume of cash deposits from various unknown sources, which were then used to purchase bank drafts payable to third parties or casinos.”
The centre says the second type of money mule often reported their occupation as “homemaker.” Their bank accounts typically had a lot of cash deposits from unknown sources, wire transfers from third parties or trading companies, the purchase or redemption of various investments and casino-gambling activity.
Fintrac is advising casinos to scrutinize patrons who: Deposit a high volume of bank drafts to a gambling-fund account or who regularly use bank drafts as a form of gambling buy-in; Are accompanied to a casino by someone subject to a gambling ban; Live in a jurisdiction subject to currency-control restrictions or sanctions and have no local ties to family or businesses.

Affordable housing is possible, even in Toronto’s core: Castlepoint Numa looks to mix differing social, demographic groups in its new development

Full text: If there’s one thing that Alfredo Romano is most proud of when it comes to his 3C Waterfront development, it might be the way it debunks an old real estate adage – the one that says you can’t have dissimilar income and demographic brackets co-existing on the same piece of high-priced real estate.
“I don’t want to create exclusive neighbourhoods,” says Mr. Romano, president of Torontobased Castlepoint Numa. “It’s not what we’re about and it’s not what the city should be about. Toronto is so tightly woven that unless you integrate housing types across the city, you end up creating ghettos.
Urbanistically, it’s better to have mixed neighbourhoods.”
And 3C Waterfront will be exactly that – on a grand scale. A 2.5million-square-foot community of commercial, residential and public buildings on a 13.5-acre strip of prime real estate abutting the Keating Channel, the 1,000metre long waterway in Toronto that connects the Don River to inner Toronto Harbour on Lake Ontario. That’s an area roughly the size of Nathan Phillips Square, with 1.5 times the square footage of the U.K.’s second tallest building, One Canada Square located at London’s Canary Wharf.
The defining structures at 3C Waterfront will be a 50,000square-foot arts complex with multimedia programming and three towers, each a maximum height of 50 storeys. In a bid to attain Gold Certification under the globally recognized Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design standards, exteriors of the buildings will be made from precast, energy efficient materials instead of traditional glazing. These precast exteriors will retain heat in winter and stay cooler in summer, making the building complex more efficient throughout the year.
Also slated for the development are mid-rise, residential finger buildings, including some 225 affordable homes (10 per cent of the total) for lower income families and professionals.
Typically, developers build separate entrances, lobbies and even structures to accommodate what’s known in the industry as inclusionary zoning, but 3C Waterfront is making a point of avoiding this “poor door” syndrome.
“Trying to make affordability and creating a sense of community ought to be the top priority in any development,” says Mitch Kosny, a long-time professor and associate director of Ryerson University’s School of Urban and Regional Planning. “Having a sociodemographic mix is normal and appropriate. It’s the definition of a healthy community and it’s pretty much what most Canadians grew up with. Homogeneity is not what we should be building.”
At the heart of 3C Waterfront will be a pedestrian zone featuring a Barcelona-style plaza, which will serve as a kind of urban mixing bowl. Alternately fed by boulevards and compact laneways – what the Dutch called woonerfs, or “living streets,” because they prioritize human movement over other forms of traffic – it will be flanked by Shibuya-style shops and Les Halles café terraces instead. Also planned is a red-brick tunnel linking 3C with the historic Distillery District to the immediate north, creating a supersized pedestrian zone that will connect to the lakeshore promenade.
SOURCING LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL BRAINPOWER “A huge amount of brainpower was sourced locally and internationally to realize 3C,” says Mr. Romano, who also developed Toronto’s 58-storey L Tower condos on the Esplanade and the new Museum of Contemporary Art in the Lower Junction. “It’s European in intent with high design values, which is why the first firm we hired for the master plan was Foster + Partners.”
London-based Foster + Partners is a kind of Georges Braque or Giorgio de Chirico of the design world, whose cubist-influenced designs include the Kuwait International Airport and The One skyscraper at Yonge and Bloor – Canada’s tallest building at 85-storeys.
In total, six leading architectural firms collaborated on 3C, including Toronto’s KPMB Architects, Montreal’s Claude Cormier + Associates and New York’s SHoP Architects.
But for all its progressive thinking and innovative design, 3C Waterfront – which is being developed by Castlepoint Numa in partnership with Cityzen Development Group and Continental Ventures – has been somewhat lost in the shadows of its attention-hogging new neighbour, Google affiliate Sidewalk Labs.
Sidewalk’s controversial proposal for an experimental smart hub on a 12-acre parcel at Quayside – slightly smaller than 3C Waterfront with an assessed value of $590-million – has almost entirely dominated the conversation and media coverage surrounding the future of the eastern waterfront.
“What will be transformative for the area is incremental, high quality development from a variety of players,” Mr. Romano says.
“Sidewalk Labs could become a part of that constellation.”
SYMBIOTIC CONNECTION TO QUAYSIDE In fact, 3C and Quayside have much in common, with some industry watchers describing 3C as Quayside minus the surveillance and data collection. For example, both are working on a large canvas – not only in terms of scale, but also coherence and vision. As the biggest private-sector development on Toronto’s private waterfront land, terms such as community building, livability and affordability were front and centre in 3C planning conversations, right from the start.
“Both projects have major roles to play in the extension of Queen’s Quay East as the public spine of the eastern waterfront,” says Bruce Kuwabara, founding partner at Toronto’s KPMB Architects who helped articulate 3C’s master plan. “They should complement one another by creating centres of gathering that serve both precincts.”
Waterfront Toronto, a powerful not-for-profit mandated by three levels of government (including the City of Toronto) to deliver a revitalized waterfront, is spearheading a push for housing affordability.
It stipulates that at minimum, 20 per cent of residential units built on the waterfront must be made available to market at a 20 per cent discount, as defined by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation.
For example, data show that a one-bedroom apartment in Toronto today rents for an average of $1,270 a month whereas, according to Waterfront Toronto’s definition of affordable rent, the same unit would be available for $1,016 a month.
According to this formula, Sidewalk Labs proposes to make 20 per cent of all residential units affordable, with at least a quarter of those going to people with pronounced affordability needs. Another 20 per cent of residential units will be set aside for middleincome households. “The missing middle is an area of need that has been repeatedly highlighted by government and leading thinkers on housing, but is often left out of development plans,” says Keerthana Rang, associate director of communications at Sidewalk Labs.
“I’m a big advocate for affordable housing so I like that 3C is putting together all the ingredients for a complete community,” says Meg Davis, chief development officer at Waterfront Toronto, saying that 3C and Quayside together are expected to deliver about 725 affordable homes.
By some estimates, if even 10 per cent of the kind of citywide inclusionary zoning mandated by Waterfront Toronto had been enacted 25 years ago, an additional stock of 50,000 affordable homes would now be available in Toronto – a figure that could have significantly diminished the continuing sting of this city’s worst ever housing crisis.
But with Toronto developers cancelling numerous condo projects in recent years (Castlepoint Numa’s Museum FLTS among them), creating affordability has become even more difficult.
“The industry used to count on certain cost increases and timelines that are no longer reliable,” Mr. Romano says. “I will never again launch a project unless I’m sure the regulatory framework is completely solved.”
A VALUES-BASED APPROACH That does not, however, change Mr. Romano’s commitment to what he calls “values-based” development. “Not everything comes down to a simple numerical value and the bottom line,” says Mr. Romano, saying that Castlepoint Numa plans to build about 500 affordable homes in the next 10 years, all independently of government assistance. A majority will be erected on the eastern waterfront, where Castlepoint also owns a five-acre property on nearby Cherry Street.
So much of Toronto’s future as a livable megacity hinges on successful, thoughtful expansion.
But how will the area look in 10 years? “We’ll have neighbourhoods that are diverse, walkable, compact and affordable,” says KPMB Architects’ Mr. Kuwabara.
“There will be increased bicycle usage and a demand for social services including daycare and schools.”
Adds Mr. Romano: “When I first started building here 25 years ago there was almost nothing east of Yonge Sreet except derelict buildings. Seeing everything come together like this is enormously satisfying.”

Full text: A coffee company that started in church basements is Second Cup Ltd.’s first acquisition as it pursues a new strategy to expand by buying small food-service businesses.
Second Cup announced on Thursday that it will acquire Bridgehead Coffee.
Bridgehead owns 19 coffee shops in Ottawa, and plans to expand to Toronto under the new ownership.
Bridgehead began in 1981, founded by church ministers and social activists, and sold fairly traded coffee out of church basements in Toronto. It was acquired by Oxfam-Canada in 1984, expanding to sell a range of other products; after suffering losses, it underwent a restructuring in the late 1990s. Tracey Clark acquired the brand in 2000 and has been CEO ever since, expanding the chain of coffee shops in Ottawa. Second Cup will pay $6-million in cash and $3.5-million in Second Cup shares to acquire Bridgehead, with as much as $1.5million in additional payments over the next two years if the company meets earnings targets.
Ms. Clark will continue in a new role as Bridgehead’s “chief culture officer,” while chief operating officer Kate Burnett will take over leadership of Bridgehead. Its roast master and director of coffee will both continue with the company, and Second Cup’s parent company says the chain will be run independently of Second Cup stores.
“They will be able to provide us with real estate opportunities, will be able to provide capital and will be able to provide some shared services that are important,” Ms. Clark said.
Bridgehead first approached Second Cup about a possible deal roughly 18 months ago, as it looked to expand. Ms. Clark wanted to open cafés in Toronto as far back as 2008, but the plan was shelved when the financial downturn made it more difficult to raise capital.
Bridgehead built its brand on touting its ethically sourced beans, and buying ingredients for its food and baked goods – such as vegetables and sheep’s milk yogurt – from local farms. It will continue to do so in the markets where it expands, Ms. Clark said.
“Both being in coffee, the knee-jerk reaction would be to go and buy the same coffee. That’s not a decision that we want to force on Bridgehead,” Second Cup CEO Steven Pelton said. “We don’t want to homogenize the brands.”
Second Cup first announced its new acquisition plan last month. The company believes it can expand by buying up smaller regional food-service brands. As part of its acquisition plan, Second Cup plans to change its corporate name to Aegis Brands Inc. in the new year; the name of the coffee shops will not change.
“This is exactly the kind of acquisition that fits into our repertoire, where they’ve done a great job in a region and they want to go bigger,” Mr. Pelton said.
The deal is expected to close before the end of the month.

Developer, Habitat for Humanity strike deal for affordable housing in Toronto: Parties agree to establish $17-million non-profit fund as solution to deadlock over number of low-cost units at Bloor and Dufferin project

Full text: After a two-year negotiation over the zoning for a seven-acre development at Bloor and Dufferin in Toronto, the city, the local community and the developer announced an agreement last week on an “innovative” deal to create a $17-million fund to build affordable housing.
But Josh Bénard, Habitat for Humanity’s vice-president for real estate development, who brokered the deal, cautioned that it does not amount to a “get out of jail free card” for developers seeking a way around the thorny problem of negotiating an appropriate level of affordable units in their projects.
Capital Developments and Metropia had committed to 56 units of affordable rental, or about 2.5 per cent of the units in the 2,162-unit condominium project at Bloor and Dufferin. The community group Build a Better Bloor Dufferin (BBBD) was asking for 20 per cent of the units to be affordable, or about 430 units.
The distance between those proposals set the stage for a deadlock – the kind that often ends up in the Local Planning Appeal Tribunal (LPAT).
The fund may have been a card developers played to get a community on board with its plans, but Mr. Bénard stresses that if Capital Developments wasn’t already building 56 affordable units on the site, Habitat wouldn’t have agreed to put its name to the deal.
“You can’t just write a cheque and absolve yourself from building inclusive communities,” Mr. Bénard said.
“Our brand has a lot of value and we do not hitch our brand or organization to just any business.”
“We’re trying to do things differently as a company,” said Todd Cowan, Capital Developments co-founder and managing partner. “We believe in trying to find solutions other than just going to the OMB [or more recently LPAT] … in trying to find solutions that create a win-win for all involved.”
“Unfortunately, at the end of the day, we realized there was a big gap in terms of what was feasible,” said Jordan Dermer, the other co-founder and managing partner with Capital Developments.
For Emily Paradis, co-chair of BBBD and an instructor at the University of Toronto’s urban-studies program, the issue of providing more affordable housing is not a parochial neighbourhood concern – it’s a systemic regional failure.
“Of the hundreds of thousands of new units developed in the past five years, only a tiny fraction … have been affordable to households of low and moderate incomes,” she said. The community group had other concerns, about parkland and community space, but the housing request was rooted in the city’s own estimates. “It didn’t come out of nowhere. The city itself recommended 20 per cent as an appropriate allocation for inclusionary zoning: It’s across from a subway station and part of a major transit area,” she said.
As it happens, the local councillor for Ward 9 is Ana Bailao, a deputy mayor and the city’s affordable-housing czar, who convened a number of meetings over the two years, even urging the parties into mediation to no avail.
Then, she invited Habitat for Humanity to join the talks and see if a solution could be found.
“The developer really wanted to get to a yes and really wanted to contribute to the community,” Ms. Bailao said. “I felt they wanted to start on the right foot. They understand they are going to be in the community for a long time; you don’t develop seven acres in a few days.”
After discussing a number of options with Capital Development and BBBD, Mr. Bénard called Mr. Cowan on a Saturday about a month ago and pitched him a new idea: Instead of putting more affordable units on the site, what if the developer gave some money to establish a non-profit land trust that could go and spend that money more efficiently on affordable housing? “They had put a number on the table that was less than this [the $9-million in cash, an $8-million loan and $2-million for community space], to buy more units on the site,” said Mr. Bénard, but the numbers wouldn’t have been significant.
(The parties call the fund a “land trust”, even though there is no land being transacted – it is an agreement that the money must be spent inside Toronto and Ward 9 on building affordable housing.)
The kind of housing units Habitat likes to build are between 800 and 1,000 square feet. Currently, market prices for units at a transit-located condominium in Toronto top $1,000 a square foot, which on the Dufferin site would mean about 20 Habitat units.
But, given the same amount of cash, Mr. Bénard says Habitat can stretch those dollars further than a private developer can.
“Habitat has a philosophy that we’re not building multimillion dollar condos that have granite countertops. When I build a building, I get massive discounts that are then passed onto the families [who buy the below-market units].”
Mr. Bénard thinks Habitat can stretch that land-trust cash to build between 100 and 180 affordable units, and he has hopes of expanding the trust with new donations and commitments from other levels of government to build even more. “Our rule is, for every dollar we get we can multiply that by four … in three to five years, we could see some significant growth in this money,” he said.
Mr. Bénard says his phone has been ringing off the hook with developers, philanthropists and other affordable-housing advocates and providers asking how they can replicate his deal-making.

If you build it, they will grow: Montreal’s Lufa Farms is constructing world’s largest rooftop farm to sustainably feed a city

Full text: At a traffic-heavy intersection in the Montreal suburb of Ville Saint-Laurent, where cookie-cutter housing bumps up against a seventies-era shopping mall, “data nerds” are building what they tout as the largest rooftop farm in the world.
Low-flying jets roar overhead before touching down at nearby Trudeau International Airport as workers for Lufa Farms install the skeleton of a gigantic greenhouse – roughly the size of three football fields – on top of a sprawling office/warehouse complex.
“Bigger is better,” says Lauren Rathmell, Lufa Farms co-founder and greenhouse director.
She and her team, including life partner and Lufa Farms co-founder and CEO Mohamed Hage, have been refining their high-tech system for large-scale urban agriculture over the past 10 years.
Team members, she says, are “data nerds” intent on making highyield, year-round hydroponic rooftop farming an even more viable, sustainable and productive way to feed cities. So far, they have nurtured three successful rooftop greenhouses producing greens and vegetables in the Montreal boroughs of Ahuntsic, Anjou and in the north shore city of Laval. Saint-Laurent is their fourth and most ambitious project to date.
“It’s a big jump,” said Ms. Rathmell, a former native of Vermont who studied biochemistry at McGill University. “We’re learning with each site. We learned a ton about everything that goes into responsible agriculture.”
Saint-Laurent will not only be the biggest, but also the most efficient in terms of energy conservation and smart water consumption, Ms. Rathmell said. Rainwater is captured and all water used for irrigation is recirculated in a closed-loop system. Being situated on a roof means significant energy savings thanks to the thermal benefits of shared space.
Other energy-saving features of the new greenhouse include double-paned glass and two sets of energy-saving screens for better protection against nighttime heat loss.
And locally grown fresh vegetables help offset the big carbon footprint made by long-distance trucks hauling food across hundreds or even thousands of kilometres. Though Lufa Farms does offer customers a wide range of products from far away, including oranges, bananas and grapefruits, and cold-smoked wild sockeye salmon from British Columbia, in addition to its own produce.
No synthetic pesticides are used. Lufa Farms developed its own biocontrol software that closely monitors so-called “hot spots” – areas with a high concentration of pests, such as aphids, Ms. Rathmell said. Parasitic wasps and ladybugs are among the “good” insects used to attack the “bad” ones.
Among produce to be grown at the Saint-Laurent site are eggplants and more than 10 different tomato varieties.
Specially designed software programs are used to co-ordinate the warehouse logistics and distribution activities, as well as to monitor purchasing trends and adjust offerings accordingly.
“We’re very data-centric,” Ms. Rathmell said. “We use data to drive decision-making.” Customers go online to pick and choose the products they want on a weekly basis. They can either collect their customized baskets at neighbourhood pickup points throughout the city or have them delivered to their door in electric vehicles. The cost is a minimum of $20 a basket, $5 extra for home delivery.
From about 100 weekly baskets in the early days, Lufa Farms now packs some 17,000 units a week and hopes to double that by next May, once Saint-Laurent is fully operational, Ms. Rathmell said.
Through partnerships with producers, the company fills out its baskets with everything from cheese and homemade pasta sauce to free-range eggs.
The company now employs more than 300 people.
At 163,800 square feet, the Saint-Laurent site will boast a greater surface area than that of the three existing greenhouses combined.
Olivier Demers-Dubé, founder and CEO of Écosystèmes alimentaires urbains (ÉAU), an organization that helps communities set up their own urban farming operations, says one benefit of the large-scale commercial approach taken by Lufa Farms is that it contributes to heightening citydwellers’ awareness of food sourcing and environmental concerns.
“Helping bring people closer to farming, developing eco-awareness, familiarity with where your food comes from, on a regular basis, that’s all good,” he said. At the same time, there is a greater appreciation for the role rooftop greening can play not only in countering the “heat-island” effect in cities and promoting energy efficiency but also in urban densification, Mr. Demers-Dubé said.
Amélie Bourbonnais, co-founder of organic farm Les jardins du chat noir in the Montérégie region of Quebec and member of the Family Farmers Network, she believes it’s important for consumers to be clear on the difference between what she and fellow local producers do and the Lufa Farms approach. “We don’t do reselling,” she said. [Lufa Farms] has “become kind of like an online grocery.”
Ms. Rathmell said financing in the company’s early days came in the form of “love money” from family and friends.
Subsequent investors in the privately held firm have included Quebec’s labour fund Fonds de solidarité FTQ and Canadian clean-tech venture capital fund Cycle Capital Management Inc.
“We certainly want to keep growing,” Ms. Rathmell said. Besides possible future locations in Montreal, Lufa Farms is also exploring even farther horizons, with potential new sites in Boston and Toronto.
For the Saint-Laurent greenhouse, a partnership was struck with Laval, Que.-based real estate developer Groupe Montoni, owner of the building. The two entities had already developed a good working relationship after striking a deal for a greenhouse on a Montoni building in Laval in 2013, Ms. Rathmell said.
Saint-Laurent mayor Alan DeSousa has proudly touted Lufa Farms’ arrival on his territory. The greenhouse “will facilitate residents’ access to local, sustainably grown products and further promote healthy habits,” he said in a recent news release. “It will also make it possible to fight against heat islands in our district, where more than 70 per cent of the surface area is devoted to industrial and commercial activities.”
Ms. Rathmell said it’s great to be able to continue contributing to Montreal’s reputation as a global hub for sustainable urban agriculture. Lufa Farms claims bragging rights to launching the world’s first commercial rooftop greenhouse, in 2011. Now, this latest project in Saint-Laurent “definitely positions Canada and Montreal well,” she said.

Century-old glove factory to anchor new, state-of-the-art centre: Kitchener development combines factory and new glass-walled office to build best-of-bothworlds community

Full text: Back when business was in full swing, few employees at the Huck Glove factory in Kitchener, Ont., could have imagined where their brick-and-beam workplace would eventually end up a century later: connected to a futuristic steel and glass six-storey commercial office building with condo towers looming overhead.
But that’s precisely the plan for the ambitious adaptive reuse project, called GloveBox, a 144,272-square-foot building with an expected occupancy of fall, 2021.
Matt Bolen, principal architect of Waterloo, Ont.-based Edge Architects who is working on the project, says that incorporating the smaller, century-old factory into a new build means they can still create large, 30-by-30 square-foot grid, Class A office space in the floors above the old building. That is perfect for attracting larger Class A tenants that require the space and modern amenities, such as banks of washrooms and showers on every floor.
“For the rest of the building area, we can create that perfect, optimal layout and amenities – but still give it this little jewel of the Huck Glove story and heritage,” he says. “It’s kind of like the best of both worlds.”
The GloveBox, which will be connected to the new part of the building via a modern three-storey glass atrium, is the first phase of the much more expansive $250-million mixed-use project, Garment Street District, developed by Waterloo-based Momentum Developments, Kitchener’s Zehr Group of Companies and KingSett Capital in Toronto. The project combines the GloveBox’s commercial floors with 11,000 square feet of retail space and 689 condo units spread over three condo towers.
A new road, aptly named “Garment Street,” will connect them all.
It’s the latest development in Kitchener’s so-called Innovation District, which has attracted tech companies such as Google to the area and is the launching pad for entrepreneurs using the Communitech Hub services and office space down the street.
“I consider this pretty much centre ice,” says Jane Klugman, broker and president of Whitney & Company Realty Ltd. in Waterloo, who has been working on the project for more than a year. “It’s at the heart of the Innovation District. University of Waterloo is almost a neighbour.
McMaster’s medical school is almost a neighbour. They’re all on that block.”
With so many new companies and school campus buildings moving to the area – not to mention into the GloveBox itself in a couple of years – it’s little wonder that hot, new communities are springing up nearby. There’s definitely much more demand for residential space, says Don Zehr, chief executive officer for The Zehr Group.
“Once you have employment, then you need beds,” he says, explaining that once condo units sell out, that’s when retail moves in to create an ecosystem of work, live and play. “What I think you typically get in these mixed-use spaces are cool services, whether that be bars and restaurants or interesting retail.”
But those aren’t the only businesses moving in. This past September, KPMG Canada signed on to become the GloveBox’s anchor tenant. Colton Zehr, associate with The Zehr Group, says the company’s move to downtown Kitchener can be seen as a harbinger of the next wave of tenants to the gentrifying area.
“We have prominent businesses now coming downtown to service the tech companies,” he says, explaining that while hot, burgeoning IT businesses might not be able to afford the rent for Class A office space yet, legal and accounting firms can, “and now they want to be right in the same neighbourhood as the tech companies and help them grow.”
Ms. Klugman isn’t surprised that this next wave of large, established tenants are moving into the area, particularly now that office space like that found in the GloveBox is opening up.
“There are so many selling points,” she says. “The floor plates are the largest we’ve seen in the downtown core in a long, time. They’re almost 27,000 square feet.”
Of course that office footprint is a boon, agrees architect Mr. Bolen, and it likely would have been simpler to just knock down the old Huck Glove factory and build on the site. But considering the area’s employees, and soon-to-be residents – younger millennials who don’t want to commute in from the suburbs – it just made sense to keep the old factory standing.
“Call it a new generation that doesn’t necessarily place the same value on suburban, shiny new things,” he says, explaining that younger employees want to live and work in communities with a history. “The great thing about these older buildings is they have a story that people can connect to.”

Full text: It can take years to create an overnight success. That old adage is certainly true of Trez Capital.
In 1997, Trez Capital founder and chief executive officer Morley Greene recognized that large financial institutions weren’t meeting the needs of commercial property owners and developers for access to shorter-term financing.
“The key to our success has always been the way we look after our investors’ money,” said Mr. Greene. “Over the years we have earned the trust of our partners with our demonstrated experience and track record.” And, as Mr. Greene will point out, his first borrower is still a borrower and his first investor is still an investor today.
The Vancouver-based company has emerged as a powerhouse commercial real estate financier. In fact, it’s one of the largest non-bank commercial mortgage lenders in Canada and is fast becoming a trusted source of financing for U.S.developers and owners.
For 22 years, Trez has been providing debt and equity financing solutions that benefit property owners and investors alike. Today, the firm is fast approaching $4-billion in assets under management and has funded over 1,450 transactions worth in excess of $10-billion.
Now the company is stepping up its expansion into the U.S. market. A key move was bringing Dave Bloom on board in the summer of 2019.
The industry veteran founded the commercial real estate group for a major asset management company, which he led for 17 years. Mr.Bloom has worked in the U.S. and internationally and been involved in more than $25-billion in debt and equity transactions during his 32-year career.
As chief investment officer, Mr. Bloom is helping to accelerate the U.S. charge. He says that Trez is already well positioned in the world’s largest real estate market.
“There is an enormously strong base, a long history and a phenomenal infrastructure already in place,” Bloom says. As a member of the executive committee, Bloom is assisting with the expansion of the Trez platform to include differentiated and scalable debt and equity investment opportunities.
Trez’s growth has come from a steady approach. The company delivers solid, risk-adjusted returns to its investors by providing fully secured mortgages to developers and owners. Consistent and durable returns are key to the popularity of Trez’s diversified investment funds, explains chief financial officer Sandy Manson.
“We’re not shooting for the moon. We’re trying to hit singles and doubles if you will,” Mr. Manson says. “We want a strong return for our investors, but we aren’t willing to take outsized risks with investors’ money. We are fiduciaries and stewards of capital first and foremost and we deliver returns to our investors while preserving the capital entrusted to us.”
He says the key to the company’s success is a meticulous process for evaluating investments, and a strict adherence to the lending standards it has put in place for itself.
Trez applies prudent risk management and rigorous institutional-grade underwriting and lends to seasoned developers and owners with solid track records of finishing projects on-time and on-budget. This strategy enables Trez to deliver solid and predictable returns for investors.
The company invests capital that comes from a network of more than 1,000 investment advisors from most of Canada’s brokerage houses, along with large institutional investors such as pension and endowment funds.
Typical mortgage investments range from six to 36 months and are between $15-million and $150-million.
For the first decade of its existence, Trez focused exclusively on bridge financing in Canada in virtually all commercial real estate asset classes (residential, office, retail and industrial). “We were all-Canadian to begin with but following the recession of 2008-2009, we recognized the opportunity the U.S. market represented for our business,” says Mr. Manson.
Trez started small with a few financings in Texas but accelerated quickly by strategically adding key talent in their chosen markets.
Beyond its Vancouver headquarters and a Toronto office, Trez has offices in Dallas, Palm Beach and Atlanta.
Today, more than 60 per cent of its diversified loan portfolio is invested in U.S. real estate.
In Canada, a flagship project for Trez was its participation in the Edmonton ICE District, one of North America’s largest mixed-use sports and entertainment projects. In the U.S., recent Trez successes include the joint venture development and sale of the 314-unit Winding Creek residential project in Dallas, and a $115-million financing for a large mixed-use development in Greenville, S.C.
Trez targets markets with growing populations, above average employment growth and above average GDP growth. Trez has boots on the ground and local expertise in the areas where it invests, to ensure deep knowledge of the risks and the rewards of all its projects.
The company seeks opportunities that address specific needs of each market. That includes affordable housing for the growing population in markets where employment is being added, and commercial and industrial projects in markets with a rising GDP and booming economic activity.
Trez provides customized financing solutions to its borrowers and has positioned itself as a faster, more focused and specialized source of debt financing to the real estate industry.
“A key thing that developers and owners are looking for, that banks are not able to match, is our speed of execution,” says Dean Kirkham, Trez’s chief credit officer.
Kirkham has spent most of his career within the North American banking sector. He has headed efforts to marry the best of the banking sector’s discipline and rigour to the entrepreneurial spirit of Trez.
“We are very strategic at how we look at deals,” Mr. Kirkham says.
“By being methodical and clear as to our expectations, both internally and with our borrowers, we have created a much more efficient process. As a result, we deliver much faster than the banks, which is a differentiating factor that gives us a clear market advantage.”

Lessons Alberta can learn from Texas about becoming less dependent on oil

Full text: Freelance writer and the former editor of Alberta Oil magazine and Vancouver magazine. He previously worked in Alberta’s Climate Change Office.
There may be no other place that holds a more prominent place in the shared imagination of Albertans than the state of Texas.
It’s their geopolitical brother from another mother, a place similarly defined by western culture, rugged individuality and billions of barrels of oil and gas.
While their numbers and influence have waned as American oil and gas companies retrenched south of the border, there is still a lively community of actual Texans living and working in Alberta.
That helps explain why Alberta Premier Jason Kenney visited the state last week in a four-day effort to drum up investment in the province’s oil and gas industry.
But if he wanted to bring back something of value, the Premier should have returned with a renewed commitment to supporting economic diversification in Alberta. After all, it’s the one area where Alberta and Texas have taken very different paths.
This probably comes as a surprise to many Albertans. After all, as the home of the shale boom, Texas and its rapidly expanding oil and gas production have both transformed the global oil market and challenged the countries and companies that operate in it. But for all of that activity, oil and gas doesn’t have nearly the same grip on their economic identity (or their economic prospects) as it does in Alberta. It’s only the third-largest industry in the state, behind manufacturing and financial services, and Texas actually has the fourth-most diverse economy in the entire United States. Yes, Texas.
It isn’t the only oil and gas economy that’s embraced the importance of economic diversification lately. Gulf states such as Qatar and the United Arab Emirates have both made meaningful investments in non-oil sectors, while Russia has tried to grow its tech sector. Even Saudi Arabia has cottoned on to the importance of producing something other than barrels of oil. That’s why it launched Vision 2030, an ambitious (if not entirely realistic) plan to grow the country’s tourism and hospitality industry, invest in health and education services and even sell a piece of Saudi Aramco, the crown jewel of its stateowned oil industry.
But it’s in Texas where this transition is most obviously under way and where its benefits are already being felt.
Thanks to the arrival of tech giants such as Facebook, Google and Oracle, Austin has been one of the fastest-growing major metro areas in the United States over the past decade.
Apple recently joined the tech-sector party when it announced that it would be building a new US$1-billion campus in north Austin, which could more than double the company’s existing local workforce of 7,000 people. Its rapidly growing manufacturing sector generated US$226-billion in economic activity in 2017 and accounted for nearly a million direct jobs and more than two million indirect ones in areas like chemical products, computer electronics and motor vehicles.
How did Texas manage to pull off this feat? By making the most of the advantages it already had, ones that Alberta just happens to share. Both have the same favourable demographics, with more young workers and fewer elderly dependants than most places in North America. Both have well-educated labour pools that are a product of their strong postsecondary systems. Both have tax systems that attract investment and reward prosperity, and comparatively affordable commercial and residential real estate. And both have governments that are actively supporting efforts to attract new businesses and industries.
Or, at least, they did. In the Alberta government’s most recent budget, it all but abandoned those efforts. Finance Minister Travis Toews described economic diversification as “a luxury,” and the cuts to both postsecondary education funding and a number of tax credits aimed at attracting new tech talent and businesses to the province seem designed to ensure it remains that way.
Its decision to take the axe to the programs offered by Energy Efficiency Alberta, ones that had generated $850-million in economic growth in the province since it was created in 2017, means it could once again be the only jurisdiction in North America without energy-efficiency programming. And it even chopped the funding for Alberta Innovates, an organization whose mandate revolves around helping the province’s economy adapt to – and benefit from – technological change.
It’s not too late for Alberta to shift course here. There is still time to restore the tax credits, re-invest in the province’s post-secondary institutions and embrace the province’s enormous renewable-energy assets. And perhaps Mr.Kenney’s visit to Texas has shown him that investments in non-energy businesses don’t have to be treated as a threat to the old economic order. But this has not been a government that’s demonstrated a lot of ideological flexibility thus far, least of all on matters pertaining to the energy sector.
If doesn’t get the rebound in global commodity prices that it seems to be betting so heavily on, this unwillingness to bend could prove to be the breaking point for the rest of the province’s economy.

How Amazon’s plan to expand will reshape Vancouver’s tech scene

Full text: Thousands of new Amazon.com Inc. jobs in downtown Vancouver will reshape the city’s technology sector by triggering a talent war, boosting wages and driving immigration, local tech leaders say – while further tightening one of Canada’s highest-demand housing markets.
The Seattle-based company is one of many giant U.S. tech firms that have deepened their presences in Vancouver for years, alongside others, such as Microsoft Corp. and Facebook Inc. But Amazon’s new planned offices on the site of Vancouver’s old Post Office building, where it would lease an entire city block with two office towers, is set to make the ecommerce and cloud services company the city’s largest corporate tenant.
The Globe and Mail first reported the new lease Wednesday.
The 1.1 million square feet could accommodate as many as 10,000 people, according to real estate industry experts – a tenfold increase from Amazon’s most recent local employment figure.
Industry leaders believe there will be long-term benefits as immigrants flock to work at the new Amazon office, and newly minted leaders take the skills and wealth they gain there to start local companies of their own.
But the increased Amazon presence is expected to put more immediate pressure on Vancouver’s already tight tech-job market. Statistics Canada and real estate service CBRE reported this year that the city has 75,000 tech jobs at an average annual wage of $80,000. The average Amazon software engineer in Canada makes closer to $90,000, according to the compensation research service PayScale. Adding thousands of new positions in the city, both in tech and support roles, could put a strain on homegrown firms as they either pony up more cash or start bleeding talent.
“That’s not a ripple – that’s a rock in the pond,” said Shamil Hargovan, chief executive officer of Wiivv Wearables Inc., a Vancouver custom footwear tech company. (Amazon declined to detail its latest hiring plans, but had set an earlier target of 5,000 corporate employees in Vancouver before its new lease was revealed.)
With historically low unemployment levels and high demand among both locally owned and global employers, the shortage of tech talent is a long-standing concern in Vancouver.
KPMG’s most recent report card for the province’s tech sector notes the industry’s growth is “outpacing the rate at which provincial schools and training organizations can provide new blood.”
Raghwa Gopal, the head of Crown corporation Innovate BC, said that postsecondary education institutions are fully aware “they won’t be able to produce talent as fast as companies are consuming it.”
But he hopes that coding camps and other skills-retraining programs offered by groups such as Brainstation and Lighthouse Labs will encourage mid-career Vancouverites to join the growing tech sector.
The staggering number of positions Amazon could hire would also undoubtedly encourage more immigration to the Lower Mainland, Mr. Gopal and other leaders say.
The Innovate BC head said he believes that two fast-tracking programs for skilled immigrants, British Columbia’s provincial nominee program and Ottawa’s Global Skills Strategy, will help Amazon and others hire the workers they need. Local organizations such as VanHack also help connect foreign workers with local employers.
In Vancouver, however, increasing the population comes at a heavy price – literally, given its sky-high housing prices even after the market’s peak. Thousands of potential new Vancouverites would translate to even higher home and rental prices and longer commutes. Some executives worry they might have to eventually consider opening or expanding in other cities.
But Greg Smith, CEO of online-course platform Thinkific, says he believes that such advance warning of Amazon’s hiring plans could also give local developers more certainty to build in the city sooner to increase the housing supply before it’s too late.
Like many other local tech leaders, Mr. Smith recognizes that Amazon’s massive plans will undoubtedly cause shortterm strain, but ultimately boost Vancouver’s reputation as a global tech hub. “It makes it easier to go hire someone in Brazil and bring them here, because we’re more present in the media that way,” he said.
“It’ll help our tech sector mature,” added Carl Schmidt, cofounder of the website landing page sales platform Unbounce Marketing Solutions Inc. Jay Rhind, partner at Vancouver’s Rhino Ventures, pointed to the “entrepreneurial engineers” that build their own companies after leaving Big Tech giants in Seattle and San Francisco: “That’s why innovation still exists there.”
Not all skilled tech workers will get excited about the corporate culture at a company the size of Amazon, either. The company has a reported reputation as a tough workplace – not just in its warehouses, some of whose workers went on strike for Black Friday, but in its corporate office as well.
And despite the massive scope of its new Vancouver lease, it will effectively be a branch office of a company with tens of thousands of employees worldwide, making it a hard journey for those who want to quickly rise through the ranks.
“There are much more accelerated opportunities for development when you’re part of a smaller organization,” said Ryan Donovan, the senior vice-president of product and technology at social-media management platform Hootsuite Inc., one of Vancouver’s most well-known tech companies, which has more than 500 employees in the city.
Having lost several employees to Amazon in the past, Wiivv CEO Mr. Hargovan is aware that they offer “a crazy amount of money.”
But he pointed out that startups have a tool in their arsenal that can be equally or more attractive than massive salaries: the chance to own an early stake in a company that could blow up.
And he believes that the increased competition for talent in Vancouver will make more entrepreneurs be generous with company equity. It’ll be competitive, but “the very best founders and businesses will attract and maintain the very best talent.”
Some executives speculate that Amazon’s competitive wages will boost salaries across the city’s tech sector, too. But that would come with a caveat: Lower-income workers would be further pushed to the margins in an already expensive city.
“It’s the ability to meet people outside of tech that is also still a draw” to Vancouver, Mr. Hargovan said.
“The worst thing to happen to Seattle and San Francisco was this override of tech, meaning people in other fields couldn’t live in the area any more.”

Full text: The twin 1970s brown-brick apartment buildings that rise above a supermarket and strip plazas in northwest Toronto aren’t elegant or even striking.
But the Country Club Towers, both 27 storeys tall and backing onto a golf course, are crown jewels of a sort. The buildings are two of the largest in a portfolio of 44 dated suburban rental buildings and, in early November, the collection sold for an astonishing $1.7-billion. It was among the steepest valuations in Canadian commercial real estate history, relative to the properties’ rental income.
The sale process was an unusual one. The current owner, Toronto-based Continuum Residential REIT, had launched a $300-million initial public offering for 40 per cent of its shares in October, but after a few weeks of marketing the deal was massively oversubscribed – with orders totalling $1-billion. The night before the deal was supposed to price, privately owned Toronto real estate firm Starlight Investments swooped in and proposed buying the whole portfolio. The offer was so good that Continuum withdrew its IPO.
The single transaction solidified a trend that had been brewing for months: Canadian apartment buildings have become one of the hottest asset classes in the world, and institutional buyers desperate to find the next great investment are scrambling to scoop them up.
able to live in Denmark’s largest cities, the government proposed a new law that would limit rent increases – even if new landlords upgrade units. For its part, Blackstone has said it owns just 0.5 per cent of the rental apartments in Copenhagen, and that it will keep investing in the country.
“I understand the stigma of foreign capital,” said Michael Waters, the chief executive officer of Ottawa-based Minto Group, a large rental-apartment owner and developer. But he argues that, “in any aspect of the Canadian economy, foreign direct investment is generally a good thing … housing is no different.”
Any fear-mongering would also be hypocritical.
Toronto-based Brookfield is a global property giant and many large Canadian pension funds also have large real estate holdings around the world. “Capital doesn’t have any borders any more,” said Mr. Kriter of Cushman & Wakefield.
The more critical issue is where the fresh capital flows – to construction of new apartments or to scooping up existing buildings and maybe flipping them after a few years.
At the moment, both types of capital are at work.
Blackstone, for instance, teamed up with Starlight in 2018 to start investing in Canadian rentals, and in the 18 months since it has announced two acquisitions of existing portfolios.
At the other end of the spectrum, Morguard Corp., one of Canada’s largest commercial and residential landlords, built and opened two towers in midtown Toronto five years ago, one of the city’s first new rental projects in decades.
Other developers are also testing the waters, including Daniels Corp., a Toronto developer that has announced several partnerships with the city to construct buildings with a mix of market and subsidized units.
RioCan REIT, one of the country’s largest shopping-centre owners, also has ambitious plans to build rental apartments. Many of its malls in and around large cities are surrounded by large parking lots, offering valuable land it already owns to increase density, and RioCan has found through its research that younger people in urban markets will pay premium rents for new builds with amenities such as cold storage for their food deliveries.
The REIT’s long-time CEO, Ed Sonshine, has also been one of the few willing to call it like it is. He’s argued that while it’s possible to put lipstick on a pig – meaning a 50-year-old apartment building – it’s still a pig. “When you’ve got 50 years of cooking in a building, the walls smell,” he said in an interview with The Globe earlier this year. “And you can’t replace anything, because then you have to kick people out.”
Yet even if every new investment dollar flowed into rental construction, it would still take years to fix the demand-supply imbalance. Simply getting the necessary approvals to start building can be maddening for developers.
Mr. Waters, the Minto CEO, says it took his company six years to get the necessary sign-offs for one new Toronto development. A full year went by getting permission to cut down six non-native trees that Minto had promised to replant. “This is in a city that has [a] housing affordability crisis,” he said.
Such delays are common in Vancouver, too. “It’s almost as if we need a housing czar,” said Mr. Goodman, the commercial realtor. If a project is sitting in limbo for more than a year, perhaps a heavy hand should intervene to escort it through the bureaucracy.
But then, there are local residents, who also put up roadblocks. In Vancouver, residents routinely complain about potential shadows from new towers, or partial blockages of their view of the water or mountains, sending developers back to the drawing board. “The NIMBYism is at a level that is so astonishing,” Mr. Goodman said.
Given the rental market’s current trajectory – soaring demand and stifled supply – the short-term outlook is turbulent.
Already, rising rents are forcing tenants to reconsider what they have, so turnover is starting to slow.
If the affordability crisis escalates, “you’re going to have tenants who don’t want to leave their units,” RioCan’s Mr. Gitlin said.
Some frustrated renters have already taken to the streets. Last year, a group of tenants in Hamilton were so angry about above-guideline rent increases they trekked to Ottawa to try to protest at the home of InterRent REIT’s CEO.
Governments are also proceeding cautiously. In 2017, former Ontario Liberal premier Kathleen Wynne extended rent controls to new builds – before that, only properties built before 1991 were subject to them. Last year, though, newly elected Progressive Conservative Premier Doug Ford removed them from new builds, but kept them on existing units.
As this plays out, demand continues to swell. Immigration has been a staple of federal Liberal and Conservative government policies for decades and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is keen on welcoming even more skilled newcomers to boost the economy.
“Unlike other global leaders, Canada remains supportive of immigration as an economic imperative,” real estate consultancy CBRE noted in a recent report, adding that immigration accounted for 80 per cent of Canada’s population growth last year.
All these forces mean that pressure will keep building, pushing Canada into new territory. Sheila Botting is Deloitte’s national real estate leader, and she’s spent close to three decades in commercial real estate. She said she’s never seen a crisis boil over so quickly.
What makes this situation so intractable is that there’s no easy fix. New money is both good and bad.
Upgrades to old buildings are necessary, but there’s nowhere for existing tenants to go. Immigration adds pressure, but it’s necessary for economic growth. “As much as everyone likes to think there is a simple answer,” Ms. Botting warns, “there isn’t.”

Full text: GILLIN/JOLLIFFE Elizabeth Gillin and Tom Jolliffe are very pleased to announce the birth of their son, William Andrew Gillin Jolliffe at 10:17 p.m. on November 24, 2019, weighing 7 lbs, 5 oz. William is excitedly welcomed by his big sister, Hazel; his grandparents Peter and Dianne Gillin and Bill and Susan Jolliffe; his aunts and uncles Sarah Gillin and David Matheson, Andrew Gillin and Samantha Weng, Claire Gillin, and Keltie and Doug Chapman; and by his cousins Simon Chapman and Franklin Matheson.
DR. VALERIE MARIE DANIEL ALCOCK (née Robinson) At Scarborough General Hospital on November 20th, 2019 at the age of 92 years. Beloved mother of Debbie (Sands), Martin and James, grandmother of Stephanie, Michael and Kate, great-grandmother of Luicano and Tristan, predeceased by her beloved husband Benjamin by 18 years and granddaughter Amy by 7 years.
Valerie was born in London, England as the youngest of three, and attended the Royal Free Medical School for Women at the end of WWII. She graduated with a degree in Medicine, and then went on to study as an ear, nose and throat surgeon at Battersea hospital in London. Unable to secure a residency in that field, she then retrained as a general practitioner and opened an allfemale surgery in Lewisham, where she continued to practice her art until the family immigrated to Canada in 1969. Unable to work in her field again due to requalification requirements, she finished her career as an Associate Professor of Occupational Health at the University of Toronto.
She loved to travel and has visited many countries in the world in Europe, Asia and America. She took her family on European vacations and accompanied her husband to scientific conferences all over the world. After his passing, she continued to travel with friends on vacation and to visit her family in western Canada. She was a great cook, an active patron of the arts, and loved to read and engage in lively conversations.
In her later years she fell prone to Alzheimer’s disease, but remained active until the age of 91 years, when she moved to a retirement residence. Her death was a result of complications of this disease.
Donations in her memory to the Alzheimer’s or Diabetes associations are welcomed.
KURT RICHARD BAUBOCK CA, CPA April 12, 1931 November 24, 2019 A self-made man, arriving in Canada from Austria with little more than a shilling in his pocket.
He worked the assembly line at Drug Trading taking a personal loan from his boss to become a Chartered Accountant. He was an auditor prior to landing as department head at Gorrie’s Golden Mile Motors. He became Secretary Treasurer of this Chev/ Olds dealership that expanded from one dealership into a veritable automotive empire over his years there.
Kurt imported his love of European culture, his appreciation of opera and increasing knowledge of wine spanned his lifetime, as did his enjoyment of skiing around the world and boating from his cottage on Georgian Bay. He is survived by his two daughters, Carol and Cindy. We thank his best friends, the other April 1931 Austrians, who have been of great support to him. Cremation has taken place, and a celebration of Kurt’s life will take place in spring.
If you would like to send your condolences, kindly direct them to baubockcondolences@gmail.com.
In lieu of flowers, donations to Covenant House would be appreciated.
WILLIAM HAMILTON BELL “Bill” October 14, 1923 – November 24, 2019 Athlete, teacher, coach, husband, father and grandfather.
Born in Yarmouth Nova Scotia, Dad slipped away peacefully in his 97th year on Sunday, November 24th.
Dad was a proud WWII veteran serving in the RCAF assigned to 427 “Lion” squadron part of the Canadian 6 Group stationed in England from March to December 1944. Dad served as a mid upper gunner in his Halifax bomber surviving 34 missions with his fellow crewmen.
After completing his tour of duty, Dad returned to Toronto and successfully tried out for the Toronto Argonauts playing a variety of positions (required in those days) as a scat back, defensive back, punter and backup quarterback.
His name is proudly displayed on the Grey Cup three times, winning consecutive championships in 1945/46/and 47 with the Argos.
In those years, pro football did not generate anything close to a reasonable income and so additional employment opportunities were constantly being sought out during the off season. One such opportunity involved Dad taking a summer job in the northern community of Kapuskasing, ON working for a local pulp and paper company where he was introduced to a very pretty young lady (Logia Trukan) working in the office. One thing led to another and they were off on their first of many dates before marrying in 1948. Mom and Dad were soul mates, enjoying each other’s company happily married for 54 years.
After his Argo football career Dad pursued his degree and teaching certification at Queen’s University which included playing four years with the Queens Golden Gaels football team. More wonderful memories and friends were collected over those university years.
After graduation, Dad and Mom packed up and headed north once again to start a family and teaching career in the mining town of Lively, ON just west of Sudbury, raising sons Mike, Colin and Tom. Sadly, Colin passed away in infancy. Dad eventually became Head of the Physical Education Department at Lively & District Secondary School. Along with being an educator, Dad excelled in coaching and helping students develop their athletic potential.
After a career in education spanning 30 years, Dad and Mom built their retirement home on Irish Lake just outside Markdale, ON. The next 20 years were spent in happy retirement, blending into the community, making friends, golfing, cross country and downhill skiing, fishing, a few trips here and there sprinkled in, and many an evening fire enjoyed together.
Following Mom’s passing, Dad found companionship with Rosamond Nicholas. After marrying, they spent a number of years together living in Markdale, travelling to Florida in the winter and Nova Scotia in the summer.
Dad was predeceased by sisters Pauline Dooley and Jewel Russell, and brother Garnet.
The Family would like to thank all the dedicated staff at both Whispering Pines Retirement Residence and Grove Park Long Term Care Home in Barrie, ON for the wonderful care Dad received.
Cremation has already taken place. A celebration of life is being planned in early May. Announcement to follow.
BRIAN ENGLISH Arthur Brian English, born in Winnipeg in 1944, passed away October 31, 2019 in White Rock, BC. Much loved by his wife of 50 years, Valerie (Burnside); daughters, Marnie, Kellie (Alex), and Robyn (Christian); and grandchildren, Bryson, Kaylee, Autumn, James, Hayden and Silas.
A celebration of life will be held early in 2020. Condolences may be sent to 2151 127 A St. South, Surrey, BC V4A 3T1. Brian would be honoured if donations in his name were directed to the Alzheimer Society of B.C.
GLENNIS MARGARET LAMB FARQUHAR Glennis Farquhar died peacefully, in her 90th year, at the Queen Elizabeth II Health Sciences Centre, Halifax, on November 20, 2019. Cherished wife and devoted partner of 58 years of the late Rev.
Alexander J. Farquhar (2008), she will be lovingly remembered by her children, Alec (Kathleen), James (Liliane), Sarah (Randell), Megan (David), Donald (Kathryn), Anaya (Donald), and Katherine (Robert); her brother-in-law, Hugh (Claudette); sisters, Melva and Patricia; cousins, Carol and Joan; and many who called her ‘Auntie Glennis.’ She was affectionately known as ‘Grammie’ to Anwen (Josh), Martha (Tyler), Alec, Rory (Lauren), Ivy (Eliot), Kevin (Desiree), Michael, Elise (Matthew), Madeleine, Reid, Paul, Sophie, Olivia, and Alexandra; and ‘Great-Grammie’ to Aurora, Magali, Eliza, Sylvie, Josie, Ciaran, Janelle, Harlow, Alexander, and David. She was predeceased by her parents, Wesley and Jean Lamb, and her brother, John.
Glennis grew up in the picturesque Qu’Appelle Valley region of Saskatchewan, a brilliant student, sensitive soul, and granddaughter of hardy homesteaders. One summer evening in 1948, while she was in teacher’s college, she met a handsome and athletic young student minister from Nova Scotia named Alex, who immediately wrote to a friend, “Tonight, I met a girl I could marry.” Although a little less smitten at first sight than he, she eventually reciprocated his ardor when he returned the following summer. After two fulfilling years of teaching in prairie schoolhouses, she married him in July, 1950, and they moved to the Maritimes to begin a life in ministry together.
Glennis was the tender and patient mother of seven, proud grandmother of fourteen, and delighted great-grandmother of ten. With her quiet poise, gentle charm and natural empathy, she was adored by all whose acquaintance she made. She met life’s adversities with dignity, grace, and deep reserves of strength, resilience and faith. She will be missed dearly.
A funeral service will be held at St. Matthew’s United Church, Halifax, on Saturday, December 7 at 2 p.m., Rev. Betsy Hogan presiding. A reception will follow in the church hall. The family extends heartfelt thanks to the attentive staff of the Geriatric Unit on Lane 9, QEII Health Sciences Centre, and to Barbara Bickle and all who participated in Glennis’ kind care and companionship. In lieu of flowers, remembrances may be made in Glennis’ name to the QEII Health Sciences Centre Foundation (‘Geriatric Medicine Research and Teaching’ under ‘for a specific area or purpose’) https://qe2foundation.ca/waysgive/remember-life or the Halifax Public Libraries https://www.

JAMES W. GOODWIN Dr. James Goodwin died peacefully on November 28, 2019 at Christie Gardens. Born and raised in Toronto, he attended Upper Canada College, the University of Toronto and Harvard Medical School, becoming an obstetrician and gynecologist.
After marrying Diane Johnson in 1955, Jimmy and Di raised three children while following teaching appointments to Boston, Iran, England, and Edmonton, before settling in Toronto. Specializing in perinatology, Jimmy helped set up one of the first high-risk pregnancy units in Canada at Women’s College Hospital; he estimated he delivered 7000 babies in his distinguished career.
With a passion for history and cultures, Jimmy’s restless spirit led him to leading medical positions in Saudi Arabia, Oman and Newfoundland. There he met and married Allison, settling in Yarmouth NS for 10 years before returning to Toronto. In retirement, Jimmy continued his love of life-long learning by enrolling at the University of Toronto to pursue an MA in history and write a biography of a heroic WWII Canadian navy surgeon.
Jimmy is survived by his wife Allison, brother John and his wife Jamie, sister Barbara, daughter Karen (Randy), son Dave (Mary), son Rob (Kathryn); grandchildren Kate, Lucas, Graham and Savannah as well as numerous nieces, nephews and their children. A memorial service will be held at 11 a.m. on December 16th at Christ Church, Deer Park.

SHELAH LAVALLIN KENT (Puxley) Shelah Kent died November 20, 2019 at age 90 in Kemptville, Ont., after a long struggle with congestive heart failure.
Mum, or Granny to her four adoring granddaughters and their friends, was a well-read force of nature and positive energy.
She loved the flow of banter at family gatherings and enjoyed words in all forms — puzzles, friendly political debate, or mispronounced on the CBC.
She cheerfully created “perfectly dreadful” meals that never were, and called a succession of Conservative politicians Toad One and Toad Two.
Shelah (her own idiosyncratic spelling) was born in Kénogami, in Quebec’s Lac St. Jean region.
She, twin sister Ann, and brother Simon grew up in Hudson Heights, Que., with parents Robert and Betty Puxley (LLoyd).
A decade after Mum married Colin Kent in 1953, the family moved to Toronto, continuing west to Calgary in 1975.
Last September, she returned East to live in a retirement home with Ann (Hurd).
Her wit, generosity, and kindness are sorely missed by Ann, sons David (Wendy Shaw) and Gordon (Rita Feutl), granddaughters Maggie Kent, Nathalie Kent, Emma Kent and Sarah Feutl, sister-in-law Eleanor Puxley, extended family, and friends.
Predeceased by Colin and Simon.
A visitation will be held 3-5 p.m.
December 14th at Mt. Pleasant Funeral Centre, 375 Mt. Pleasant Rd., Toronto. In lieu of flowers, please consider donating to the charity of your choice.
STEPHEN KOWALCHUK (B.A., B.Sc.)
July 7, 1917 November 26, 2019 Steve left this world happily and gracefully, after a long productive life as a father, husband, grandfather, and educator. He joins his predeceased loved ones: wife Doris (Tait) to whom he was joyfully married for 67 years, son Barry, his mother and father, brothers and sisters.
Steve leaves behind his son Don (Jill), grandson Keith (Penny), and nephews Maurice (Brenda), Harry (Anne) and Wayne (Denise).
Born and raised in Glace Bay, N.S., until attending university, he never really forgot about the Maritimes and the Cabot Trail, which he often said was God’s Country.
WWII cut short his medical pursuit at McGill. He joined the infantry as a private in 1942, coming home as a Lieutenant in the Canadian Artillery, having earned the Defense of Canada medal, and Overseas Service medal (and a distinct hatred of mutton!).
After discharge, Steve spent the next 25 years with increasing responsibilities in the pharmaceutical and packaged goods industries, before turning to his first love: teaching. Seneca College was home for the next thirteen years, followed by a similar tenure at the Toronto School of Business, imparting guidance, insights and wisdom to hundreds of students.
Additionally, Steve was a proud decades-long member of the Markham Lions.
But above all, he had a genuine interest in people, a positive attitude, a love of life, and a search for new knowledge and experiences that kept him active right to the end of his long life: truly a unique individual! He will be dearly missed.
We would like to thank Dr. T, her nurses, and all the staff at Amica Unionville for their support.
No flowers, please; donations may be made in his name to the Canadian Cancer Society.
Following cremation, a memorial service will be held at Highland Funeral Home, Markham Chapel, 10 Cachet Woods Court (northeast corner of 16th Ave & Hwy 404) on Sunday December 8, at 1:00 p.m.
Online condolences may be made to www.highlandfuneralhome.ca PAUL LABBÉ On November 27, 2019 Paul E.
Labbé passed away peacefully after a seven year battle with myelofibrosis.
Paul was a principled man of high energy and big ideas who led by example.
Loved by all, a devoted husband, father and grandfather, he is survived by his wife, Grace, his five children, Paule (Nik Nanos), Marc (Jaqui Cadieux), Phil (Lisa Jamrozinski), David (Emily Borse), Robert (Mary Ellis) and his 13 grandchildren James, Jordan, Greg, Bernadette, Paul, Marc, Norman, Liam, Evelyn, Arthur, Margot, Edwin and Francis.
Predeceased by his brother Marc, his sister Margot, and beloved granddaughter Reese. He leaves behind his sisters Lucille Simard and Suzanne Labbé, and many nieces, nephews, and in-laws.
Born in Buckingham, Quebec to Dorothy Gorman-Labbé and Judge Arthur Labbé, Paul graduated from McGill University in 1964 with a degree in law.
He started his career as a Trade Commissioner in the Canadian Embassy in Paris (1966-69), then served as chief of staff to the Hon. Jean-Luc Pépin, Minister of Industry, Trade and Commerce (1969-72). He was a founding member of Interimco, a private international trading company (1972-80). He returned to the federal government to run the Canadian Industrial Renewal Board. In 1985, he was appointed to establish and lead Investment Canada. He was President of Export Development Canada (1991-97) and Chairman and CEO of Citibank Canada (1997-2000).
In his retirement, he served on several public and nonprofit boards, including as Director of the Dundee Wealth Bank, President of the Rideau Club, Chair of the Schulich School of Business International Advisory Council, on the Saint Patrick’s Basilica restoration committee, and Pallium Canada.
Paul was a devout Catholic, with an appetite for intellectual pursuits.
He was happiest pushing the limits of conventional road travel, cutting a rug with his wife, playing shinny hockey with his grandchildren and enjoying a good meal with family.

KENNETH CUNNINGHAM MCTAGGART August 10, 1919 - November 13, 2019 Died in VGH after a brief illness. He was predeceased by his sister, Jean. He leaves behind his wife Margaret; children Kathy (Morgan) and Bruce; brother Ted (Eleanor) and many nieces and nephews; also friends, colleagues, and former students across BC and beyond.
Ken was born in the West End to a long-time Vancouver family and graduated from UBC with a degree in geology in 1943. He later completed a master’s degree at Queen’s University, and a doctorate at Yale. He started his career with the Geological Survey of Canada, based in Ottawa.
In 1950, he took a position as an assistant professor of geology at UBC. He and Margaret married, and moved into the old army huts at Acadia Camp, UBC. In 1955, they moved into a brand new house in the Endowment Lands, nearby. They lived in that same house for the next 60 years, before recently moving into Tapestry, a retirement residence in Vancouver.
Ken taught happily at UBC for 35 years. After retirement, as a professor emeritus, he traveled the province—collecting placer gold specimens to be analyzed to track their origins to the “mother lodes” of the Cariboo gold rush. He never found these sources, but he, Margaret, and colleagues had a good time trying! Ken’s other interests, before and after retirement, included creative writing (he completed a novel about prospecting in BC, and in later years, he wrote poetry). He and Margaret usually had a dog (four spaniels over the years), and he always had a workshop with a project underway—woodwork or other “tinkering.” He gardened enthusiastically well into his 90s, quoting his father: “All I want is a kind word, and a load of manure.”
Boats and travel figured largely in Ken’s life. He built one small sailboat, and owned two others, exploring the waters of Georgia Strait and beyond. He and Margaret also sailed among the islands of Greece and Turkey. He passed on his passion for boats to both of his children.
When small boat ownership became too onerous, Ken moved on to bigger craft, and he and Margaret enjoyed many cruises. Greece was a favourite destination for many years, both on ships and on adventurous land trips, and Ken, with his usual diligence, eventually gained a working knowledge of modern Greek.
Ken was a kind man, who was curious about everything, and indulged that wide-ranging curiosity to the very end. In his last weeks, his interests were focused on physics and the cosmos. He felt that “not only is the universe stranger than we imagine, it is stranger than we can imagine!” We will miss him.
A celebration of his life is planned for spring 2020. Donations in his name can be made to the Vancouver Sun Children’s Fund, www.vansunkidsfund.ca/donate/.
ELAINE LEE Elaine Lee passed away suddenly on the 18th of November, 2019.
Elaine was the eldest child of Wilfred and Jean Lee. She was born in Val Marie, Saskatchewan on the 10th of June, 1954.
Elaine is survived by her husband, Stephen Helliar; her son, Kevin Campbell; stepson, Michael Crossley; stepdaughter, Robin Crossley; and her brother, John Lee; as well her grandchildren, Alexa, Parker and Elsie. She was predeceased by her beloved dog Barclay, who passed away at Christmas time in 2016.
Elaine grew up in many small communities across the province of Saskatchewan, as her father Wilf was in the RCMP. She attended high school in Yorkton, Saskatchewan.
She obtained a bachelor of education and home economics, and taught high school for many years, mostly at Mount Royal in Saskatoon. She enjoyed the challenges of working with young students and trying to get the best out of them. She then took on a new adventure of attending Law School at the University of Saskatchewan and finished as the gold medalist in her graduating class while also caring for Kevin, who had just been born.
After a short time in private practice, Elaine joined the Department of Justice as a lawyer dealing with the adjudication of many of the most important Aboriginal Land Claims across the country. She was known for her ability to develop creative legal arguments and her effectiveness as an advocate in Court.
Elaine loved to travel. She developed the travel bug when she was taken to Europe as a teenager by her parents. One of her favourite memories was travelling behind the iron curtain in the 1980’s before it fell. Her and Stephen recently spent a month touring around Sicily in their own car, which was symbolic of her desire for adventure.
Her son Kevin was her pride and joy. She had recently moved to Burnaby, BC along with Stephen to enjoy the British Columbia climate in retirement and spend more time with Kevin, who lived in Vancouver.
She constantly marvelled at the beauty of their new neighbourhood, and was looking forward to the continuation of a long and full life there.
There will be a celebration of life at a later date. Friends and Family from all across Canada will be invited.
DAVID HOWARD MEDLAND July 23, 1946 November 26, 2019 David passed away peacefully in the loving arms of family on the morning of Tuesday, November 26, 2019. Never one for standing in line, we imagine that David slipped St.
Peter a twenty, and now rests in heaven with his devoted parents Aubrey and Helen, beloved brother John, and nephew Kenneth! David is survived by his loving sisters Janet Marsh and Pam O’Rorke, nephews Edward and John, nieces Cathy, Anne, Susan and Kim, along with their spouses and 20 greatnieces and nephews whom David adored, and by whom he is greatly loved.
David’s chosen family Paul and his wife Anita, daughter Kennedy, son Noah and Duke the dog brought him infinite joy and pride, and showed remarkable love and compassion to David, especially in his golden years.
Born in Toronto, David proudly attended Upper Canada College, York University, and Osgoode Hall Law School.
During his career as a criminal lawyer David was a champion for the mentally ill, and continued to support this cause throughout his life, most remarkably through Pilot Place, where he served as Chairman of the Board.
David’s generous spirit and big heart were extended to a wide circle of friends, many of whom shared in his love of the cottage, playing golf and cribbage, reading books by the stack, gourmet toasteroven cooking, and talking through the moon to his loved ones from whatever corner of the earth he was in.
David, you always made it a True Daily Double, we will all miss you immensely, and “We’ll see you when we see you”.
For those who wish to bid David farewell and express condolences, visitation will be held on Tuesday, December 3, 2019 at the Mount Pleasant Funeral Centre from 10-11 a.m., followed by a service commencing at 11 a.m. In lieu of flowers, David would appreciate memorial donations be made to Pilot Place through PilotPlaceSociety.org.
BARBARA ELIZABETH MERCER May 13, 1933 November 18, 2019 Barbara a painter, poet, and longtime resident of Cabbagetown, Toronto, passed away after a short struggle with pancreatic cancer. Born in Galt/Cambridge, she studied art in New York, San Francisco, and Toronto. She worked at various times for the CBC Television, TV Ontario, The Saint Lawrence Centre for the Performing Arts, The Canadian Opera Company, The National Ballet of Canada, and other theatre groups. As an artist, Barbara drew inspiration from her surroundings, especially the Cabbagetown neighbourhood where she moved permanently in the early 1990’s following the death of her partner Gerry Moses. Her dreamlike paintings - mainly still-life and portraits - were distinctive for their brilliant colours and sharply outlined features. In 2003, her “My Canadian Icons: Nine Portraits in the Shape of a Diamond” was chosen as Canadian representative at the Biennale Internatzionale in Florence, Italy. Although she had been writing poetry since she was a child, her first publication came only in 2004. Since then she has produced thirteen books of poetry. In 2008, Barbara was invited to launch her book, “Secrets” in Oslo, Norway, at the International Literary Festival. Many of Barbara’s books were specifically addressed to Cabbagetown and its inhabitants - and not just the human ones.

JEAN RUTHERFORD STAUBLE Jean died peacefully on November 24, 2019, in Toronto, aged 90, following a stroke. Beloved wife for 65 years of the late Dr. William (Bill) Stauble, devoted mother of Cynthia (Nigel Potts), David (Maria Ringo), Katherine (David Devlin) and Julie (Steven Wood), and loving Granny to Michael, Maddy, Sarah, Claire, Cameron and James. Jean was predeceased by sisters Mary Wang and Jocelyn Fyfe. She will be sorely missed. Born and raised in Montreal, Jean received her B.A. from McGill University, where she met Bill. They raised their family in Montreal, London (England) and Toronto, and enjoyed a happy retirement in Port Hope and Cobourg, forming rich, lasting friendships in each place. For 30 years, the cottage they built in the rolling Northumberland hills was their paradise, a place for treeplanting, gardening, swimming, reading and family gatherings. Jean was a gracious host and excellent cook who passed on to her children her passion, skills and best recipes. Jean was innately compassionate. With a strong sense of social responsibility, she was ever a committed volunteer, most notably as a driver with Red Cross Corps and Braille transcriber with the CNIB. She loved language, music and art, tennis, bridge and Scrabble. To the end, and despite the challenges of dementia, she savoured a good story, generously offering her gratitude and warm smile. She was a trooper. The family is thankful for the excellent care Jean received at Revera Leaside Residence and St. Michael’s and Michael Garron Hospitals, Toronto. Special thanks to Senait, Christine and Leaside’s 5th-floor staff. A celebration of her life will be held on Saturday, February 1, at 11:00 a.m. at the Toronto Cricket, Curling and Skating Club, 141 Wilson Avenue, Toronto. In lieu of flowers, please consider donating in Jean’s name to the CNIB. Condolences and memories may be forwarded through humphreymilesnewbigging.com.
LYNDARAESUMMERVILLE
(néeWilkes) M a y 3 , 1 9 43 N ove m b e r 2 7, 2 01 9 On Wednesday, Lynda’s aorta failed and she left us that evening. The only child of her late parents, Wilfred and Rachael (neé Murphy) Wilkes, Lynda is survived by Dean, her husband of 52 years and very best friend for even longer, brother- and sister-in-law Wayne and Susan Summerville, and niece and nephew Julia and Donald Summerville. She also leaves cousins Margaret Crowley, Jim Murphy (Joan), Ernest Wilkes (Audrey), and Bob Wilkes (Susan). Born in Guelph, Lynda lived all her life in Toronto’s east end. Graduating from West Hill Collegiate, Lynda learned the skill of, and worked for many years as, a dental assistant. She later enrolled in Centennial College, obtained her designation as a legal secretary, and promptly decided to never pursue that calling. Lynda eventually returned to Centennial to work in various administrative roles until 1984. She spent the next ten years providing unceasing, loving care for her ailing father, and later, Dean’s aunt, Mary Felber, and her uncle, Bill Murphy. She was deservedly known as the caregiver in the family.
Lynda demonstrated creativity in all she did. She never hosted a dinner party which wasn’t memorable for creative cuisine and beautiful surroundings, always including flowers. This creativity married well with her love of things that grew. Lynda was a long-standing member of the Beach Garden Society and had served as its President. The gardens around her and Dean’s home inevitably drew admiring comments. And then, in 2001 she joined the Garden Club of Toronto and the rest is, as they say, history. Lynda’s passion for floral design truly blossomed. She became a very active member of the GCT in all matters of floral design and earned OHA accreditation as a judge. She competed in, and judged competitions at Canada Blooms, the CNE, and in shows for both the GCT and other garden clubs around Toronto. It was a rare occasion when Lynda didn’t win or earn a high ranking placement at these events. Her enthusiasm spilled over into crafts, inevitably combined with things floral, where she always demonstrated humour and creativity.
For the past 15 years Lynda was also the driving force behind the creation, from harvesting to drying to final assembly, of the floral arrangements that grace the City of Toronto’s Spadina House Museum, all without recompense. She became the acknowledged expert in anything concerning dried flowers.
The unconditional love Lynda gave Dean, her unending thoughtfulness, her mischievous and clever sense of humour, and her passion and willingness to share and help everyone around her are enormous losses. She will be greatly missed. A visitation will take place on Tuesday, December 3rd from 2:00 - 4:00 p.m. with a funeral service on Wednesday, December 4th at 11:00 a.m. followed by a reception, all at Pine Hills Cemetery, 625 Birchmount Rd. (north of St. Clair Ave. E.). In lieu of flowers, donations to either the Toronto Botanical Gardens or a charity of your choice would be appreciated.
NOLICARMELSWATMAN
(néeFeehily)Passed away in her 79th year after a long and courageous battle with Alzheimer’s, on Tuesday, November 26, 2019 at Norfinch Care Community Nursing Home, with her husband and son-in-law by her side. Born in Sligo, Ireland on July 8, 1940 to the late Agnes and Jim Feehily. Adored wife of Trevor (Teb) Randolph Swatman. Beloved mother of Deirdre Swatman (Josh Benish), and Carrie Swatman (Chris Miller). Loving Granny to James and Lola Miller, and loving Granna to Declan Benish, and doting aunt and friend to many. Noli was retired from York University where she worked for 30 years, and was the Director of the Office of Research Administration (ORA). Friends may visit at Holy Cross Catholic Funeral Home, 211 Langstaff Road East (Bayview and Langstaff) on Monday, December 2, 2019 from 2-4 and 6-8 p.m. A Mass of Christian Burial will be celebrated on Tuesday, December 3, 2019 at 12 p.m. in the Chapel of St. Joseph of the funeral home. Interment to be held at Holy Cross Catholic Cemetery. In lieu of flowers, donations to the Alzheimer Society of Toronto would be appreciated by the family as your expression of sympathy.
ANNMARIESWEENEY
B.A.,M.S.W.,LL.B. Wife,Mother,Lawyer, A d vo c ate Ann Marie Sweeney, of Toronto and West Vancouver, passed away on November 11, 2019 in Toronto after a determined battle against cancer. She was 83 years old.
Ann Marie was raised in Hartsdale, New York, the daughter of Edward Forbes and Kathleen Fogarty, both originally from Ireland. The oldest of two bright daughters, Ann Marie was awarded a scholarship to attend the University of St. Michael’s College at the University of Toronto. From there, she completed a Master of Social Work at Fordham University and worked as a psychiatric social worker first in New York and then Vancouver. Later, she earned a Bachelor of Laws from UBC and practiced law for 30 years.
She is survived by her sister Kay Fandetti, her daughter Brenda (Don), sons John (Alba) and James (Jas), and her three grandchildren Daniel, James and Lina. Ann Marie’s upbringing and education in a devout Catholic family instilled in her a strong sense of faith, hard work and social justice. She was a builder. She built a marriage of more than 50 years with her husband, James Brian Sweeney (d. 2013), a pediatric dentist. From this marriage, she educated and launched three children into the world while practicing law. She worked tirelessly to assist six religious orders in their work among the poor. With a beloved group of friends, she created two charitable foundations, Familia Christi and the Forbes Foundation. She found great joy in the work these foundations did to help people in Canada, Haiti, Latin America and Africa.
Whether at Familia Christi holiday sales or fundraising events at her oceanside home, Ann Marie shone brightly as an active participant in life and work. Her visits to South America with her husband bonded them together in common purpose and joy.
Many thanks to the nurses, staff and physicians who provided her with expert care in Toronto, especially Dr. Esther Rosenthal, Dr. Alexandra Easson, Dr. Raymond Jang, and devoted caregiver Haydee Coufadis. A Funeral Mass was held on Saturday, November 23, 2019 at St. Anthony’s Parish in West Vancouver, BC.
In Toronto, a memorial mass will be held at St. Basil’s Church, 50 St. Joseph St. on December 7, 2019 at 10 a.m. Lunch reception will follow at the Four Seasons Hotel, 60 Yorkville Avenue, Toronto. In lieu of flowers, the family welcomes a donation to the BCIT Foundation and asks that the funds be directed in Ann Marie Sweeney’s name to the nursing program.
STEPHANIEWOROSHYL August24,1928 November25,2019
The family sadly announces the passing of a remarkable wife, mother, grandmother, and friend to many, who passed away peacefully at the McCall Centre in Etobicoke, Ontario. Loving wife of the late William Woroshyl Sr., dearly loved mother of Bill Woroshyl (Dr. Margaret Macpherson), and cherished grandmother, “Baba”, of Matthew Woroshyl and Melissa Woroshyl. Sister of the late Edward Mymryk.
An accomplished, independent, and intelligent woman, Stephanie ventured to Canada from Ukraine in her early childhood. With her, she brought an incredible work ethic, passion for food and food service, and a love for gardening. Stephanie’s entrepreneurial spirit and passion for learning led her to the Humber College School of Culinary Arts programme, where she was the executive assistant for her mentor, Chef Igor Sokur. She was inducted into La Confrérie de la Chaine des Rotisseurs and went on to continue training in classical French cuisine at La Varenne and Le Cordon Bleu schools in Paris. Upon her return, she opened a gourmet cooking school and a boutique catering company – Stephanie’s. Later in life, she took an interest in real estate and was an agent in Mississauga, as well as managing several family companies.
Her grandchildren will deeply miss creating many Ukrainian specialties together, most notably, pierogies. The family is very grateful to the wonderful team at the McCall Centre who took special care of Stephanie in the last 6 months of her life, especially Dorett Jones and her staff. As she wished, a celebration of life will be held in the New Year.

Full text: Grand plans were drafted to urbanize Sanhe and other urban centres. But as populations fall, the visions are threatened The outward signs of an economic boom line the streets into this city just east of Beijing, where older buildings have been turned into piles of rubble – brick, concrete, plastic piping. Behind houses painted with the Chinese “chai” character that marks them for demolition, the windowless shells of large new apartment blocks pierce the horizon. Cement trucks have turned a road into a potholed mess.
It’s a familiar tableau of modern China, which for four decades has torn down the old in rural areas to make way for the concrete and steel of new urban centres – a rush of urbanization that has often been called the largest human migration in history.
But there are signs that the inaugural era of relentless Chinese urbanization has drawn to a close, making the country’s skyline a potent symbol of the economic changes sweeping the country.
The populations of roughly 28 per cent of some 3,330 urban areas in China fell between 2013 and 2016, according to an analysis released this year by Chinese researchers who used changes over time in the brightness of nighttime satellite imagery to estimate population changes.
In April, the National Development and Reform Commission, the country’s powerful economic planning body, made the problem official by naming “shrinking cities” one of its key priorities. An estimated 50 million Chinese homes, a fifth of the country’s housing stock, stand empty.
For decades, it seemed, Chinese cities could only grow. Local authorities – intoxicated by the revenue springing from new construction – drafted grand plans for the thoroughfares, bullet train stations and glasswalled towers that could cloak their towns in modernity.
But in Sanhe and hundreds of other urban centres across China, it’s not clear the grandeur of those visions will materialize. In many central and northeastern cities historically dependent on coal and steel, jobs have vanished in a modernizing economy and people are leaving. In Sanhe, residents bemoan the effects of environmental policies that have cut smog in nearby Beijing – as well as local jobs.
“We are now in the second half of the urbanization journey, and the winners and losers are much more sharply defined than in the first wave,” said Jonathan Woetzel, co-chair of the Urban China Initiative at consultancy McKinsey & Co.
Population dislocations are part of any country’s development. Chinese census data show that between 2000 and 2010, the populations of more than half of the country’s counties shrank, many in central and western China, as people moved to coastal areas for work.
But the more recent indications that numbers are waning in hundreds of cities may show deeper problems in China, as economic growth slows and the population rapidly ages.
Such shrinkage “is mainly caused by a lack of employment opportunity in an economic downturn, rather than a change in economic structure from heavy industrialization to services,” said Kaiji Chen, an economist at Atlanta’s Emory University who has studied housing in China.
“In the past, when Chinese economic growth slowed down, migrant workers tended to return to rural areas due to a lack of employment opportunities in cities,” he said. “This might slow down the pace of urbanization for the short run.”
For some Chinese scholars, that is no cause for concern.
“The shrinking city is a neutral concept. This happens in the development and transformation process, especially with big countries. There’s no need to feel horrified by it,” said Ding Changfa, a professor at the School of Economics at Xiamen University.
In China, he said, “overall urbanization is slowing down, but in areas where the economy and business are active and highly developed, the pace remains quite fast.”
After years of rapid change, 59 per cent of people now live in cities. It was only in 2011 that more than half the population became urban; in 1998, twothirds of Chinese people still lived in rural areas. The United Nations estimates that China’s urbanization will continue at high speed, with more than 70 per cent of the population in cities by 2030.
Chinese planners, meanwhile, have pursued a strategy of megaclusters, linked by dense networks of high-speed rail, where tens of millions of people can enjoy the productivity gains from living and working in urban settings.
“Today the nature of urbanization has become the development of the megapolis, which means using the advantage of supercities to boost the development of cities nearby,” Prof. Ding said.
At the same time, the slowdown in Chinese economic growth has created new incentives for planners to continue expansion, even in smaller cities where population growth is less certain.
“New buildings and construction generate a lot of GDP on paper, and local governments are incentivized to pursue that goal despite the oversupply of apartments in many places,” said Kam Wing Chan, a specialist in Chinese migrant issues at the University of Washington, in an unpublished paper.
In Sanhe, that tension between growth and contraction is evident. In 2015, it was the subject of a strikingly negative state media report. Only a few days after the inauguration of a new high-speed rail service, the People’s Daily reported that “the occupancy fell to below 30 per cent.
Some of the cars were even vacant.” Last year, authorities moved a large wholesale clothing market from Beijing to Sanhe. Some vendors say sales at the new location are less than half what they were in the capital.
(Most people interviewed in Sanhe declined to provide their full names because they were being critical of official Chinese policy.)
Prices at some local property developments have also fallen by more than half, according to an October report in Beijing News. At one marbled sales office, seven staff crowded around a reception desk near a model of a dozen proposed residential towers surrounding large green spaces. But staff said they had no marketing materials because they had not received a permit to sell units there. Across the street, a large construction site for the project showed no signs of life.
Not far away, a phone number was scrawled in white paint on a dusty roll-up door, locked in place over a small storefront. Its owner, who gave his name only as Mr. Wang, has been trying to rent the shop for more than three years.
“It feels like the number of people in Sanhe is shrinking,” he said.
Still, the city boasts some vibrant local businesses. As workers leave, the elderly – and the dead – are moving in.
At the Lingshan Pagoda Cemetery, rows of shiny gravestones line fields of closely cropped grass. The cemetery, with space for 25,000 burials, is nestled into a mountain that, marketing director Wu Xuecheng says, once inspired an emperor to write a poem extolling its beauty.
“My wish is that our graves will never be filled and everyone will remain healthy,” Mr. Wu said with a laugh.
But business is undeniably brisk, with the best plots selling for roughly $27,000 for 20 years of maintenance. State media have shown that the price of burial plots across China has closely tracked rocketing big-city real estate price gains. Fucheng Group, the company that owns the Lingshan cemetery, reported gross profits for its funeral business last year of almost 88 per cent.
The retirement business in Sanhe is also surging, although not as profitably. Yan Da Golden Age Health Nursing Center is the largest elderly residential and care facility in China with 12,000 beds. Fully 98 per cent of the people who live here come from Beijing, attracted by a comprehensive complex that offers a sprawling hospital, calligraphy room, research centre and even a mosque. The location has become home to retired professors and diplomats, lured in part by a unique program that allows the hospital, which is located in neighbouring Hebei province, to deliver services funded by the city of Beijing.
“Many old people consider our centre ‘the last station of life.’ Some have even sold their houses in Beijing to live here,” said Bi Liwei, a manager in the company’s business-development department. “So it’s quite meaningful for us to make their last stop full of joy.”
Elsewhere, though, the view of Sanhe is less sunny. “All of the non-locals are gone,” said a man that opened a piano manufacturing business in 1992, but shut it down this year. The building is now for rent. Local environmental regulations, designed to keep the skies blue over Beijing, have restricted working hours. A large quarry has been shut down and blocked off. “There’s a connection between a decrease in population and demolished shops.
Because doing business is very hard now,” said the man, who declined to provide his name.
Another man, a grocery-store owner named Mr. Zheng, has spent two years trying to find tenants for a pair of houses he owns. “The current situation is that you cannot even find a job.
Why? Because there’s no work to do,” he said. Sometimes, it feels like “there are no people in Sanhe.”

Full text: As the Toronto-area real estate market begins to wind down for 2019, some buyers are bidding up the prices of luxury properties.
Andre Kutyan, a real estate agent with Harvey Kalles Real Estate Ltd., was representing house hunters who recently considered making an offer on a house with an asking price of $4.395-million in Lawrence Park.
Mr. Kutyan thought the price was “too good to be true” as soon as he saw the listing for a renovated house in the upscale neighbourhood.
Mr. Kutyan’s clients decided against making an offer because the house doesn’t have a garage, but Mr. Kutyan kept track of the sale. Offers landed from two competing buyers and the house sold for $4.6-million, or $205,000 above the asking price.
By setting an asking price below market value, Mr. Kutyan says, the listing agent likely drew more attention to the property.
Mr. Kutyan has seen significant movement above the $4million mark in Rosedale, Lytton Park and Yorkville as well.
The agent recently sold a townhouse unit at One St. Thomas near Bloor Street West and Bay Street for the full asking price of $4.888-million. One buyer came to the table, but others were circling, he says.
Mr. Kutyan has also noticed an uptick in interest from Canadian ex-patriots currently living in Hong Kong. Tensions between Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement and Chinese authorities have been rising, with the unrest leading to violence and bloodshed.
Mr. Kutyan has been chatting with some potential purchasers at open houses and appointments for viewing his listings. He says buying real estate in Canada may be a back-up plan in the event the political situation in Hong Kong deteriorates.
“They’re feeling out their options,” he says.
Mr. Kutyan is acquainted with some Hong Kong-born students who moved to Canada for high school or university, then returned to the Asian financial capital to work. Many former students now have Canadian citizenship or permanent resident status, but they work in Beijing, Shanghai or Hong Kong. Another friend is a Canadian-born employee in the banking industry who moved to Hong Kong to pursue his career. Now he is thinking about returning.
“If everything is fine politically, these are great cities to live in,” he says. “But it’s good to have a Canadian passport in your back pocket.”
Most of the house hunters have ties to this country already.
“Very rarely do I see someone with no status in Canada buying a property.”
Mr. Kutyan has a four-bedroom house listed for sale at 70 Carmichael Ave. near Avenue Road and Wilson Avenue. The 4,000-square-foot house, with an asking price of $3.695-million, has drawn some interest from visiting ex-pats, but no one has pulled the trigger yet, he says.
Mr. Kutyan says that because the potential buyers are citizens or permanent residents of Canada, a foreign-buyers tax introduced by Ontario’s provincial government in April, 2017 has zero impact on their purchase.
Boris Kholodov, a real estate agent with Johnston & Daniel, a division of Royal LePage Real Estate Services Ltd., says the 15 per cent foreign-buyers tax does have an impact on some investors.
The tax is a deterrent to those potential buyers who work in Canada, but don’t have permanent resident status, he says.
“It makes it silly for these people to buy,” Mr. Kholodov says.
The government does offer rebates to return the tax money to foreign purchasers if they later satisfy any of the exemption criteria. Under one of those scenarios, the foreign buyer will receive a rebate if they have legally worked full-time in Ontario for a year after the purchase.
Mr. Kholodov says many potential purchasers end up renting rather than take the risk that they won’t have a job one year later.
“They’re not able to buy with the same confidence as the local buyer,” he says. “The way this tax was implemented, it was meant to discourage absentee investors.
But it has discouraged people who work here because they have to gamble on still having the same job in a year.”
Juwai.com serves Chinese-language clients who are mainly based in China and Hong Kong, and are looking to purchase property abroad. While the Shanghai-based real estate portal has not been tracking whether five months of unrest in Hong Kong have increased searches for property in Canada, communications director Dave Platter says that demand for Canadian real estate has remained high in 2019.
Hong Kong-based Eli McGeever is the vice-president of international property for Soho, which is a social network that brings together buyers, investors and agents in real estate. He says interest in Canadian property has been growing rapidly over the past few months.
In an e-mail, Mr. McGeever said an estimated 300,000 Canadian passport holders live in Hong Kong.
Mr. McGeever tracks Hong Kong property marketing exhibitions, where property from overseas is sold to buyers in the financial hub. He notes that the number of Canadian real estate exhibitions per month is up more than 50 per cent since the start of June.
Over the past three months, Toronto has accounted for 30 per cent of the Canada exhibitions, he says, and that number has increased in the past 30 days to 45 per cent.
“Hong Kongers used to buy Canadian property as an investment, but now it’s an escape route,” he says. “Many people are worried that Hong Kong won’t return to peace and growth in the near term. Some worry that Hong Kong will never again be what it was as recently as earlier this year.”
Looking ahead to 2020, Mr. Kutyan expects the first quarter to be busy. Downsizing boomers are still a force in the market and he knows some are getting ready to list existing houses for sale in January and February.
“I’m gearing up for the New Year,” he says. “That’s a great time to be on the market – as long as the weather co-operates.”

Full text: DONE DEAL 3035 Charles St., Vancouver HASTINGS-SUNRISE
Asking price: $1.225 million Selling price: $1.260 million Previous selling prices: $1,265,000 (2017); $147,600 (1999); $149,000 (1982) Days on market: 56 Taxes: $4,656.69 (2019) Listing agent: Ian Watt, Sutton Group, West Coast Realty THE ACTION Listing agent Ian Watt received five offers, all conditional. The house sold five days after listing, but because it was an estate sale and had to clear probate, the deal didn’t close until much later.
The buyers are a young family.
“It’s a narrow lot and the place needs work,” he says. “But the Vancouver Specials are very sought after, because you can do anything you want with them, they are kind of hip. There’s a lot of opportunity with that space.”
WHAT THEY GOT This Vancouver Special, built in 1981, sits on a 29.5foot-by-111-foot lot on a sunny quiet street on the city’s east side.
The 1,918-square-foot house is in original condition, with three bedrooms and 11/2 bathrooms upstairs, a dated brick fireplace, galley kitchen, open dining area and north-facing deck with mountain views.
The sellers installed new carpets and painted. Downstairs is a self-contained one-bedroom suite. The house is steps to an elementary school and within walking distance to a supermarket and the Hastings Street shopping district.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “Local money is on fire right now,” Mr. Watt says.
“Definitely the under $1.2-million market is really busy. People want to buy because they’ve noticed that we’ve hit the bottom. Buyers know they’ve already dropped 10 per cent and they won’t go down any more.”
– KERRY GOLD

Full text: Architect Mike Zuberec, 89, walks quietly from the living room to the kitchen.
In that mostly original room, homeowner Robert Steinbauer is gesticulating as he tells another architect, Harald Ensslen, of plans to remove the two major walls that hide this rather large kitchen from the rest of the 1,900-square-foot home. If this major renovation alarms Mr. Zuberec – a 1954 University of Toronto graduate, who co-hung his own shingle with Norm Macdonald in St. Catharines six decades ago – he doesn’t show it. Instead, the veteran designer runs his hand along one of the white laminate countertops, squinting up at the multiple clerestory windows and then down at the drawings that he penned of these very details in 1966.
Mr. Ensslen, who was 19 years old in 1966 and is the ‘E’ in MZE Architects (still located in St. Catharines), scans the pile of onionskin paper on the table and flips through; he stops at one of the floating staircases and marvels at his partner’s pochade technique, which involves pencilling in an area on the back of the paper so that shading reads a little more softly to the eye.
“This is in the days when the architect would put rebar and structural [on the drawings]; it was all engineered,” Mr. Ensslen says, tracing his finger along the little dashed lines on the concrete landing. “This is reinforced because of the weight of the stair.”
It may well be engineered – ironically the Fonthill, Ont., dwelling was built for Copenhagen-born structural engineer Jens Holm (1925-2015) and his wife, Elaine – but it reads as pure art. Even from the street, the very visible structure of this post-andbeam home is a Mondrian-like composition of grids, lines, voids and texture. Thick glued laminated (glulam) timber beams painted dark brown form a cage that support lighter brown, custom-milled ribbed walls where long windows carve away voids, and a shadowed entryway is tucked under a wide, cantilevered roof. It’s wonderful.
Inside, a wide foyer delights the visitor with an abundance of choice: To the left, a rich wooden door to the kitchen; to the right, the sculptural staircase – outfitted with thin pickets and a thick handrail to match the glulam beams – leads to a walkout basement; and, straight ahead, a column of geometrically stacked brick that belongs to the two-sided fireplace. There, another choice: Pivot left into the large, light-filled living room, or right into the cozy den with built-in shelving by Poul Cadovius.
“We had a lot of fun there,” Ms. Holm remembers from her midtown Toronto apartment. “It was a great place to entertain; we had the lights coming up through the birch trees and the balcony out in the back – that was a great place to serve hors d’oeuvres – and we had the nice big dining room … we’d stick the kids downstairs.”
While the Holms sold the house in 1986, their knack for entertaining was recorded in a March, 1973, Welland Tribune article, Danish Touch in Fonthill Home. Writer Sophie Homenuck describes a 100-person reception held for Dane Preben Erichsen, who had returned to Canada after a twoyear stay in his home country; in 1967, Mr. Erichsen had assisted the Holms with furnishing and lighting their new home. Ms. Homenuck describes some of it: “a beautiful rosewood dining room suite, upholstered in purple, and the living room pieces in comfortable black leather and wood,” along with noting daylight pouring in from Mr. Zuberec’s “square sky-light.”
Manipulating light is a skill every good Modernist knows, and Mr. Zuberec – born in Montreal to Slovakian immigrants who relocated to St. Catharine’s during the Second World War – was taught by some of the best during the early 1950s at the University of Toronto. In the same class as Raymond Moriyama, Mr. Zuberec counted Eric Arthur, James A. Murray, Ants Elken and Michael Bach as some of his instructors, and enjoyed guest lectures by Buckminster Fuller and other famous Modernists.
After graduation, Mr. Zuberec worked for respected St. Catharines architect Robert Ian Macbeth (1891-1978), where he designed a very Frank Lloyd Wrightian home for a local doctor. With the money he’d earned, he took a two-year “work holiday” in London, where he found employment at Modernist firm Yorke, Rosenberg and Mardall, which was then working on Gatwick Airport (he worked on a hospital in Northern Ireland). During time off, he scooted over on his Lambretta to see Le Corbusier’s famous chapel in Ronchamp, France, and as far away as Vienna, then behind the Iron Curtain, to visit his grandmother. Upon his return to Canada, he took a job with St. Catharines’ Thomas R.
Wiley, who passed away unexpectedly in 1959, leaving himself and Mr. Macdonald at the helm. This author wonders: Did that scare him?
“Didn’t bat an eye,” the bowtie-sporting octogenarian says with a laugh. “When I think back, geez we were cocky – not cocky,” he corrects. “We had confidence … based on the training that we had.”
That training would lead to dozens of 1960s schools to house the baby boom, credit unions, movie theatres and even a few art galleries, his favourite being the Tom Thomson Art Gallery in Owen Sound, which he says “turned out quite well.”
Five years ago, the Holm residence was not doing well. Mr. Zuberec and his wife of 59 years, Mary, walked the site just before Brock University professors Mr. Steinbauer and Shawna Chen purchased it: “It looked as if some guys had used the site for a dump … the finishes were peeling, it was just a pile of crap.”
Luckily, with a cabinetmaker father who flies in twice a year from Austria, Mr. Steinbauer has been giving the home the love it deserves: “Now he has the world’s biggest cabinet to refinish,” Mr. Ensslen quips, “so the two of them have [been] doing all the refinishing, rebuilding the deck, the glass, the trim.”
During the MZE Architects visit (which included architect Greg Redden and this author), topics discussed included unrelated things such as mountain biking, semirelated things such as vintage furniture finds, and very related things such as Mr. Zuberec’s alternate plans for the Holm fireplace. Debated, too, were those kitchen walls: Contemporary tastes don’t like enclosed kitchens – dinner party people always gather in the kitchen – yet to remove full walls also removes mystery and the sense of shelter humans crave.
So, what to do?
A few days later, an e-mail from Mr. Steinbauer: “We appreciate the positive feedback on our renovation progress and everybody’s input on the kitchen wall. I am happy to report that it is up for negotiation again.”

A pond at the heart of hockey: Nova Scotia property claims a historic tie to Canada’s game

Full text: College Road, RR. #1 WINDSOR, N.S.
Asking price: $1,380,000 Taxes: N/A Lot size: 23.78 Acres Agent: Dave Kerr, Avison Young (Canada) Inc.
THE BACKSTORY A family of pumpkin farmers in Nova Scotia who have been the stewards of a famous hockey site known as Long Pond are looking to sell their piece of pond hockey history. The price: $1.38-million.
But how do you put a price on hockey history? According to commercial real estate agent Dave Kerr of Avison Young – retained to sell the pond and a connecting land parcel – start with the going rate for farmland in the area and triple it.
Actually, only the smaller of the two parcels for sale has a massive premium: There’s a 16.5acre triangular parcel that would give road access to the pond and the price for that is about $40,000 an acre (still about 33 per cent higher than recent comparable prices for local land). The seven-acre parcel that contains Long Pond itself is going for about $100,000 an acre. How did Mr. Kerr arrive at that figure? His clients. “They said, ‘We want a million dollars,’ ” Mr. Kerr said.
The pond parcel also comes with a trademark for Long Pond.
Danny Dill’s family traces its history in the region back to the 1700s, and he said the land that contains Long Pond was purchased by the family in 1878, the same year his hometown of Windsor, N.S. was incorporated.
For decades it was a regular mixed farm in the Annapolis Valley – cattle, orchards, vegetables – but Mr. Dill’s father was an avid hockey fan and memorabilia collector with a flair for promotion.
Mr. Dill, who is 55, said that all his life people would pull up to the farmhouse day and night and ask to see Long Pond.
THE PROPERTY TODAY The reality for Mr. Dill is that Long Pond has charm, but giant pumpkins pay the bills. His father, who died in 2008, began growing mega gourds in the 1970s and the farm’s main business is selling pumpkin varieties (and patented Dill’s Atlantic Giants seeds to growers elsewhere).
The farm gets thousands of visitors every fall looking to pose for selfies with gigantic Dills.
Over the course of the past decade the town flirted with the idea of leveraging Long Pond into some much-needed local infrastructure. A plan to build a new rink on the site was announced, millions of dollars in provincial and municipal funding were promised, and it seemed as if a community that calls itself “the birthplace of hockey” might make this private pond into a public resource.
But as Mr. Dill tells it: “Politics got in the way.” The $12-million project was snarled up in the tense negotiations over a proposed municipal amalgamation, and when next-door town of West Hants pulled its funding from the plan, the whole project collapsed. The rink is being built at another site.
“It wouldn’t surprise me if the whole arena fiasco and how it went down influenced them to sell,” Mr. Kerr said.
“I was disappointed for sure.
… I felt bad for a lot of people who spent years and time to work at it,” said Mr. Dill, who has long harboured grand visions for the pond. “I could just see this thing exploding … if somebody took this by the horns, somebody that had deep pockets or resources, it could be one big hockey heritage theme park.”
That in part is what fuelled the valuation, Mr. Kerr said.
“They keep bringing up the Cooperstown model, they think if this were in the [United] States, there’d already be a resort there,” Mr. Kerr said.
It’s an intriguing comparison: Not only is Cooperstown, N.Y., the home of the Baseball Hall of Fame, but there are claims that baseball was invented right there on a farmer’s field now called Doubleday Field.
But claims such as that are much disputed. Historians have found copious evidence of forms of baseball being played decades before its alleged Cooperstown birth in 1839, just as there are dissenters who say that Long Pond can’t be the “cradle of hockey” the Dills say. Montreal and Kingston have claims to the title in Canada and there are records of forms of hockey called “bandy” and “shinty” played on ice in Scotland and England more than a century prior to games of “hurley” on Long Pond that local records refer to. Indisputably, people have been playing pond hockey there for a very long time (the Dills have found pucks in the muck at the edge of the pond that are more than 100 years old).
Long Pond is clearly a piece of Canada’s hockey history, Mr. Dill said he’s heard from the Hockey Hall of Fame asking him to bottle some pond water and ship it to Toronto before the sale. “I think maybe because they want a bottle of water while it is still owned by the Dill family,” Mr. Dill said.
A FAVOURITE SPACE Over the years, many a hockey legend has dropped in: Guy Lafleur and Ray Bourque stick out in Mr. Dill’s mind, and his one regret is Bobby Orr has never skated on Long Pond. He was very pleased to play host to a member of a famed hockey family with agricultural roots: the Sutters.
Rich Sutter – who played 13 seasons in the NHL and racked up 315 points and 1,411 penalty minutes – stood in the middle of the pond and reportedly told Mr. Dill, “If this is not hockey heaven, I don’t know what is.” It’s a line the Dills printed onto a photo of the pond in winter and still sell for $25 a pop.
Rather than wrangle over exactly what role the pond played in Canada’s hockey history, Mr. Kerr prefers to keep this transaction simple. “I’m not selling the birthplace of hockey, or the home of hockey, I am selling two PIDs [parcel identifiers] and one with a trademark,” he said.
The reception in the community has been mostly positive, although Mr. Kerr jokes that his colleagues are a little alarmed by all the hoopla considering his usual work involves succession planning and selling golf resorts.
” ‘Jeez Dave, why don’t you sell an office building’ they say,” Mr. Kerr said.
“We’re not overwhelmed with people looking to buy, we’ve had a few offers I would say are credible. It’s hard to find out if they have any connection to the sport,” Mr. Kerr said.
Is there someone who wants to make this small town on the south side of the Bay of Fundy into a hockey tourist hotspot? “I have faith that something special will happen,” Mr. Dill said.

Full text: ARCHITECTURE The opening of the new Eataly has brought big crowds into an important Toronto building, Manulife Centre. And the high-end Italian food emporium is a fantastic experience – as long as you don’t look at the outside.
Along with the eatery, the 1970s complex at Bloor and Bay Streets has received a significant facelift. New two-storey pavilions wrapped in glass line its main façades.
And these new additions are no match for the landmark complex. Its meticulously detailed concrete still looks good after 50 years; the new glass additions looked sloppy on Day One.
What happened here? It seems that the brutalist building – which is of serious importance to Toronto – didn’t get the attention it deserves from the owners or from the city. It’s a sad parable about the state of architecture.
The complex – one of the first mixed-use buildings in the country – consists of two towers. To the south, is a 51-storey apartment building; to the north on Bloor, a 19-storey office tower. The latter has gotten the addition. “We wanted to transform the building and make it more friendly, more welcoming,” explains Michael Bardyn, Manulife managing director, who oversees the insurance company’s real estate operations in the Toronto area.
For this they hired four design firms: architects MdeAS of New York and B&H of Toronto; retail designers GHA; and signage consultants KDA.
Too many cooks, clearly. The result is a box wrapped in glasscurtain wall – a type of glass assembly that allows for flush mounting and minimal hardware. But rather than minimal, it is messy. The glass panels are surrounded by black and white aluminum, as well as some off-white tile; the glass itself is cut in at least four different sizes, as well as a set of folding doors on the second level; it’s got ventilation shafts and a couple of strange bulb-outs to accommodate signage. More signs hang on the outside like loose scabs.
In short: If you look hard at the addition, you see an incoherent mess.
The rest of the tower is something much tougher but also more carefully designed. Its concrete façades go upward and outward for two floors, then straight to the sky in a consistent and disciplined grid. The floor plan folds in at the corners, forming a crossshape when seen from above. It’s a skillfully tailored work of architecture.
Its lead architects, the Toronto firm of Clifford and Lawrie, worked with an international set of consultants to refine the design. In the book Concrete Toronto, architect Michael Clifford describes how company execs and architects travelled to Europe and the United States to look at the best precedents.
The end result is a kind of fusion of corporate conservatism and the no-nonsense brand of modernist architecture known as brutalism. This only could have happened at this specific moment in history.
This time around, Manulife called MdeAS, “who are known for curtain wall buildings,” Mr. Bardyn says. “Their thinking was aligned with ours.” The idea, in short: Make it glassy, and “a place that you would want to walk into,” Mr. Bardyn adds.
Fine – in theory. Glass is common, relatively affordable and transparent, and it provides a strong visual contrast to the heaviness of concrete. This would have been acceptable if done well, with compositional and technical care that matches the sculptural precision of the original building. But it wasn’t.
Meanwhile, in the Eataly interior, local architects Giannone Petricone have done an elegant job executing brand’s design formula. The interior feels, as intended, somewhere between a market and a city street populated by stylish restaurants. Oak booths, deep-hued ceramic tiles and rich marble come together in tightly detailed ensembles.
What does it say about the state of design that far more attention is devoted to the interior details – stuff that will likely get torn out in a few years – than to the parts of the building that are public and permanent?
It says that some of our best modernist buildings are still misunderstood, even by their owners. (City heritage planners had nothing to say here.)
It also says we are too quick to accept simple ideas about architecture: that concrete is hostile, that glass is friendly and that sloppy architecture is good enough to build a city.

From rough to refined: The Murphy Hospitality Group has helped rejuvenate the downtown core of PEI’s capital city as part of a tourism boom

Full text: Over the past four decades of working in the hospitality industry on Prince Edward Island, there have been just a handful of bad days for Kevin Murphy. But when the occasional dud does come along, he likes to move past it by sitting in the lobby of the Great George hotel, listening to the guests wax poetic about PEI’s kinder, gentler way of life.
“It’s the simple things, like crossing a sidewalk without hearing a honked horn,” says Mr. Murphy, president of Murphy Investments Ltd., the parent company of the Murphy Hospitality Group, which owns the Great George hotel. “Where [these visitors] come from, that’s not normal.”
The Murphy Hospitality Group, set to celebrate its 40th anniversary in 2020, has helped spearhead a rejuvenation of Charlottetown’s downtown core over the past decade, opening a progression of trendy restaurants and brewpubs inside once-dilapidated buildings that have been carefully renovated to maintain their heritage look.
MARITIMES MAKEOVER KEEPS THE AREA’S HERITAGE ALIVE
Not just on PEI, but also throughout New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, the company now operates 16 food and beverage operations, two boutique hotels (including the Great George) and a brewing company.
It’s a true family business, too.
Mr. Murphy and his wife, Kathy, have three sons – Ben, Sam and Isaac – all of whom are involved with the family business in various capacities.
“These days if people go downtown in Charlottetown, they’ll hit as many as 20 restaurants in a three-block radius. A few decades ago, this wasn’t the case,” Mr. Murphy says. “Who could imagine that where the Gahan House now sits was once a dirty part of town – a spot you just didn’t go.”
The Gahan House, another Murphy Hospitality property, is now a big draw to the island’s downtown area, and was named after a mid-19th century merchant that lived and worked in PEI.
“Now there are other restaurants in the district and the area has expanded, down to the water and to other areas, and that’s the positive thing and it’s to be a fun part of it,” Mr. Murphy says.
HOW A LITTLE IDEA GREW INTO A LARGE, LEADING BEST-IN-CLASS BUSINESS
Mr. Murphy, who supported himself as a bartender as he worked toward a business degree from the University of Prince Edward Island, was hoping for not much more than a steady job when he graduated at the age of 23. Soon after, he launched what would ultimately become a lifetime career with the purchase of one restaurant: the Barn. (Sadly, this restaurant burned down in 1986.)
“I didn’t know at the time that [buying a restaurant] was pretty risky,” Mr. Murphy says. “When you’re starting out, it takes time and experience and mistakes, and only [in] probably the last 15 to 20 years has it really started to mature into a company that has some strength in its people and more focus in what we do.”
His next purchase, in 1990, was a building in downtown Charlottetown, and he recalls that the core of the province’s biggest city at that time couldn’t have been more different from what it is today.
When it first opened to the public, the Great George was situated in what was then considered a rundown, undesirable part of town. Today, along with 20 other unique buildings that share the same block, it holds pride of place as the anchor of Charlottetown’s tourism district.
Travel these days, Mr. Murphy says, is suffering through a sense of sameness. The Great George satisfies the appetites of visitors looking to “step into a story” when visiting somewhere new.
“The Fathers of Confederation stayed at the Great George. It’s authentic and real,” Mr. Murphy says. “Everything goes back to about 1860, and in all our buildings, we try to envision what it was like back then and then try to tell that story in our buildings, in our places, in our people.”
DESPITE SUCCESS, DEVELOPERS STILL HAVE AN UPHILL BATTLE
While the Murphy Hospitality Group has made a success of turning rundown buildings into some of the Island’s most celebrated restaurants and destinations, developers say restrictions remain in place that are discouraging even more growth in Charlottetown.
Tim Banks, chief executive officer of the Island’s largest commercial real estate firm, APM MacLean, says it’s been a frustrating experience dealing with city council. Mr. Banks first started working in Charlottetown in 1980.
“There is no significant new build going on in downtown Charlottetown because council has their heads stuck in the sand,” Mr. Banks says, referring to the city’s building height restriction of 39 feet and four inches.
“Any economics in any downtown core would tell you that in order to increase density and get a return on your investment you have to go up.”
He adds, “[City council] is scared someone may not be able to see through the buildings, I guess, and as a result they’ve paralyzed the ability for people to move upwards.”
Mr. Murphy agrees that working with city council can be frustrating at times. He recalls the plight of local property owners on Victoria Row that sought – and were denied – the city’s support to redesignate their street as a car-free zone.
Ultimately, the residents anted up 50 per cent of the costs to repurpose the street, including the addition of patios and an iconic wrought-iron gate entryway.
Today, 25 years after first becoming a pedestrian-friendly street, Mr. Murphy says the town has much to be proud of in Victoria Row.
By some accounts, it’s the most-visited destination in PEI – even more popular than Anne of Green Gables. Although PEI Tourism could not officially verify this claim, a representative said in an e-mail to The Globe and Mail that it “may be the case,” given its popularity with visitors from cruises.
Despite the conflicts that have occurred in the past, the City of Charlottetown is quick to praise the work done by Mr. Murphy.
“The Murphy Hospitality Group has worked hard to contribute to the beautification efforts in downtown Charlottetown, while maintaining and enhancing the heritage integrity of their buildings,” says Alex Forbes, the manager of planning and heritage at the City of Charlottetown.
“Downtown Charlottetown is a unique place, full of history, and MHG has become a part of this.”
THE FUTURE LOOKS BRIGHT
With the 40th anniversary of the Murphy Hospitality Group on the horizon, Mr. Murphy says he’s looking to the future with optimism – not just for his company, but also for Prince Edward Island, as a whole.
For example, the Island’s foodtourism strategy has resulted in an increase of more than $2-million being spent in local restaurants between the past two exit surveys commissioned by PEI Tourism. Five years ago, the Prince Edward Island Convention Centre, located by the water on the cusp of downtown, was expanded by 50,000-square-feet to help drive tourism.
And the Cavendish Beach Music Festival – of which the Murphy Hospitality Group is part owner – just celebrated its 11th anniversary in 2019 with nearly 60,000 fans in attendance.
Visitors will always come to Charlottetown’s downtown area, Mr. Murphy says, and these heritage buildings have kept a piece of Charlottetown’s history alive to greet them. The amazing part is how much this has changed in the past three decades. Mr. Murphy describes the former locations of some of his firm’s current restaurants as “literally dumps.”
The decision to bring life back into the buildings was key, Mr.Murphy says. The Murphy Hospitality Group has enjoyed being part of the renaissance of the district, he says, and seeing it expand through other blocks.
Mr. Murphy also says that conversations are under way to try to designate the street next to Victoria Row – where the Gahan House is located – for pedestrian-only traffic as well.
And on those rare days when he spends some time listening in on the conversations of guests and tourists at the Great George, it’s easy to gain a sense of the impact his efforts have had on his hometown.
“There’s real revitalization here, and perhaps it was driven by what we started at the Great George because people can see what you can do to old buildings without tearing them down,” Mr. Murphy says.

Incorporation will bring tax benefits to realtors: New rules will allow Ontario sales agents, brokers to keep their commission payments in a corporation with lower assessment rate

Full text: Ontario real estate agents are cheering a new government bill that would allow them to incorporate – a move that could mean huge tax benefits and align them with other professions as well as peers in other provinces.
The proposal is part of Bill 145, the Trust in Real Estate Services Act, and comes after more than a decade of lobbying from the industry to enable its salespeople and brokers to incorporate and have their commissions paid through the corporation.
The government says incorporation would “create a stronger business environment” and is proposing the change as part of amendments aimed at strengthening consumer choice, protection and professionalism in the real estate industry.
Almost all real estate agents are independent contractors who are paid by commission. By incorporating, salespeople and brokers could keep their commission payments in a corporation, where the money is taxed at a much lower rate before being withdrawn as income for personal use, either through a salary or dividends. Today in Ontario, only brokerage firms can incorporate, or brokers paid a management fee – separate from sales commissions – for running a brokerage.
Other professionals, including accountants, lawyers and insurance brokers, already can incorporate in Ontario and across the country. The change would put Ontario real estate salespeople and brokers on equal footing with their counterparts in B.C., Quebec, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba and Nova Scotia.
“It’s time to modernize,” said Joseph Richer, registrar of the Real Estate Council of Ontario, which regulates real estate professionals in Ontario on behalf of the provincial government.
Tim Hudak, chief executive of the Ontario Real Estate Association, an independent professional organization that represents salespeople and brokers, said the change would allow professionals to invest more in staff and new technology, and make a greater contribution to the local economy.
“It’s a modern business tool that’s available to a significant number of other professions,” said Mr. Hudak, a former leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario.
Having a corporation would also help realtors set aside more money for industry downturns.
“It appropriately recognizes that the real estate cycle can have some significant ups and downs,” he said. “… This helps them plan over that cycle.”
Andrew Zakharia, a small-business accountant and founder of AZ Accounting Firm in Toronto, said incorporating would provide “substantial savings” for some real estate agents, high earners in particular.
Incorporated professionals could defer as much as 41 per cent in taxes by leaving money in their corporation, or about $41,0000 for every $100,000 in profit. The estimate is based on the highest personal-tax rate in Ontario of 53.53 per cent and the lowest business tax rate of 12.2 per cent on the first $500,000 of profit, taking into consideration a cut in the small-business tax that begins in 2020.
Mr. Zakharia says incorporation is not as appealing for people who spend all or most of their income, in part because of the cost of incorporation, which is about $1,500 to $2,000 to set up and can range from $2,000 to $5,000 or more a year for tax-preparation.
“It will only help people who make more money than they need to live on and are leaving money inside the corporation,” he said.
Business owners that incorporate also need to keep in mind new federal passive-income rules that gradually eliminate access to the small-business deduction for Canadian-controlled private corporations that earn money from assets not directly used in the business, such as stocks and bonds. The change took effect in 2019.
Businesses lose access to the deduction if they have more than $50,000 in passive investment income in a year. They lose access entirely after $150,000 a year. Premier Doug Ford has called on the federal government to reverse the changes.
Catherine Himelfarb Borden, a Toronto-based real estate sales professional and managing partner of the Forest Hill Real Estate Inc. Brokerage Yorkville branch, says the proposed change would level the playing field.
While Forest Hill is incorporated, her commission is subject to personal-tax rates. Incorporating would allow Ms. Himelfarb Borden to keep money in her corporation and, because of the lower tax rate, invest more in the operation.
“Funds can be allocated for business growth, promotion and planning for the long-term,” she said. That includes hiring other professionals such as marketers, photographers, decorators and home stagers. “It will be great to be able to pay for them out of a corporation, instead of personally,” she said.
Incorporating would also help her compete for talent to expand her brokerage. “Prospective sales reps often ask us if they can incorporate,” she said. “Being able to answer this question in the positive will go a long way to attracting top realtors.”
The government has said it would work with the industry to develop the regulations, “including to establish rules for the structure of these corporations,” Matteo Guinci, a spokesman for the Ministry of Government and Consumer Services, said in an e-mail.
He also said the measures would ensure real estate professionals who incorporate “would continue to remain accountable and subject to all existing professional obligations including education, insurance, professional liability, code of ethics and other requirements.”

Full text: The ranks of opponents to Sidewalk Labs’ proposed “smart city” on the Toronto waterfront aren’t giving up their fight now that its plans are scaled back – and they’ve been taking advice from some well-known colleagues overseas.
Waterfront Toronto, Sidewalk’s government partner, agreed last month to let the urban-planning company keep developing plans for the neighbourhood on a smaller scale than it wanted. But its most vocal group of detractors, who call themselves #BlockSidewalk, intend to keep pushing back on the company’s plan to build a sensor-laced, technology-centric community on the shore of Lake Ontario.
They believe the proposal has given rise to enough concerns about privacy, data collection and public control over the past two years that the Google affiliate is the wrong partner for the project.
Even if Sidewalk stays, said #BlockSidewalk’s JJ Fueser, “If we sat on our hands and said we were done, the project might grow back again to its intended scope.”
In the past few months, they’ve found some formidable allies – the activists who helped stop Sidewalk’s sister company Google from opening a startup campus in Berlin a year ago.
“They really raised expectations and pushed us to understand what’s at stake,” said Ms. Fueser, who’s led communications between the two cities.
The Berliners have long been following Sidewalk’s plan and see clear parallels between the two projects: An Alphabet Inc. company that wants to profit from innovation while, they say, making cities less livable for lower-income residents.
The German activists claimed victory last October when Google backed away from the Berlin project after two years of opposition.
That night, a band of activists who oppose Big Tech’s dominance raced to the former electrical substation in the Kreuzberg neighbourhood where it would have been housed, popped bottles of Rotkappchen sparkling wine and began to spray paint a banner declaring that their war against the internet giant wasn’t over.
“Solidarity from Berlin to SF, to San Jose, to Rennes,” it read, concluding: “To Toronto.”
In the two years since Sidewalk first came to Toronto, opposition to the ways Big Tech can reshape cities has swelled. In New York, for example, Amazon.com Inc.
pulled the plug on a second major headquarters in Queens after public hostility over potential tax breaks and gentrification. The campaign against Google in Berlin has become regarded as one of the major successful pushbacks to this global phenomenon.
The Berlin campus was announced in November, 2016, after Google startup-campus success in cities such as London and Tel Aviv. In selecting Kreuzberg, it hoped to set up in Berlin’s crucible of cool – a neighbourhood filled with artists, punks and recent immigrants.
One prominent faction of Berlin activists focused on Google’s data-gathering and centralization of power online, with the hope of putting more power in the hands of users. Speaking to The Globe and Mail over pizza across the canal from the substation, one such activist described their efforts as a multidisciplinary attack from many angles.
(The activist was granted confidentiality because of possible professional retribution.)
Local anti-gentrification activists mobilized shortly after saving a beloved nearby French bakery.
“Everybody comes together here,” said Stefan Klein, an erstwhile music lawyer who now defends tenants’ rights in Kreuzberg. The community is already filling with startups and shortterm rentals, he said, shooting rent up and displacing low-income residents. He believes Google could have accelerated this process, while also getting the pick of the startup litter for acquisitions and hiring. A diverse range of other groups, from anarchists to concerned neighbours, soon joined the cause. Some opponents held “noise parties” outside the substation, banging drums and bridge rails; some held protests that drew hundreds; some briefly held a sit-in on the premises. The groups declined to engage with the company at all, out of fear that their conversation might be used to convey an endorsement.
Mr. Klein’s group, GloReiche, gained local support with brochures and community meetings.
A loose band of digital-focused activists, meanwhile, brought the campaign online and into English – while slapping thousands of stickers across the city telling Google to scram.
Google declined to comment for this story, instead forwarding its October, 2018, news release that announced it had given the space in Berlin to two social-focused organizations after “discussions with nonprofits” prompted it to rethink the space.
Sidewalk also declined to comment.
Toronto activists banded together as #BlockSidewalk this past February and soon began communicating with Berlin’s digital-decentralization activists.
From them, Ms. Fueser said, “We got the sense of, ‘Guys, it’s up to you to put No on the table.’ ” The Berliners’ ground game became much easier to emulate, Ms. Fueser said, once Sidewalk published its now-scuttled draft plan in June that sought measures well beyond Waterfront Toronto’s purview, including to vastly expand its geographic influence.
Like the Berliners, they’ve set up a central website to explain their campaign, and are spending time with people and groups who would be affected by the project, from nearby residents to waterfront sailing clubs to community groups. Many are now concerned that the project will only worsen the city’s real estate crisis, even with Sidewalk’s promise to build the legally required minimum of affordable housing. Some Sidewalk opponents have moved toward more confrontational approaches like their colleagues in Berlin. A group including members of the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, which supports low- and modest-income families, recently walked into Waterfront Toronto’s offices and successfully demanded a meeting with top executives to discuss affordable housing and mass surveillance.
There are differences between Berlin and Toronto. Sidewalk’s ambitions are bigger than a startup campus and are planned for an underdeveloped property without the immediate presence of a dense, progressive residential neighbourhood. But the Berlin organizers set off what could become a global pushback against digital giants’ physical encroachment – and they hope their colleagues in Toronto can match their success.
“It’s a catastrophe that’s happened,” Mr. Klein said.

IMF study points to Hamilton as Canada’s most overpriced market

Full text: THE LISTING
A recent report puts the real estate market in Hamilton into an exclusive club with Toronto and Vancouver: All three cities are significantly overpriced compared with normal markets.
The International Monetary Fund studied 11 large metropolitan areas in Canada and found that while there’s been price growth in a number of cities across the country, most home pricing was explainable by conventional understanding of macroeconomics in real estate. The working paper, Assessing House Prices in Canada: Borrowing Capacity and Investment Approach, states that in most markets median household income and mortgage rates should provide a rough guide to pricing.
But in Hamilton, Toronto and Vancouver the authors say “house prices have increased beyond the values implied by the fundamentals.” The IMF calculated house prices in Hamilton are 60 per cent higher than the fundamentals would suggest, and in Toronto and Vancouver it’s close to 50 per cent higher. “House prices would have to drop by roughly 30 per cent to align with the current fundamentals in these markets,” the paper contends.
The study applied valuation models based on borrowing capacity (where housing prices stay “attainable” based on the price of down payment and debt) and net-present value (based on the ability for rental income to cover costs). Toronto and Vancouver’s woes with these measures are well known – they are the two most expensive markets in the country. But Hamilton’s inclusion in the unaffordable club is a relatively new phenomenon for a traditionally blue-collar city with a long history of modest price growth.
“We do agree with the IMF that Hamilton residential properties may not be affordable for many who live in the city,” said Carol Ann Burrell, president and CEO of Realtors Association of Hamilton-Burlington (RAHB). “For those currently looking to buy for the first time, affordability can also be a challenge. There are many in the city, however, who have lower incomes and purchased a property years ago. With the average prices of residential properties in Hamilton doubling over the past decade, these Hamiltonians have seen significant gains in their equity.”
RAHB data show in October the average home price for Hamilton went up 7.1 per cent year over year, to $602,029. As recently as 2015, average Hamilton home prices were below $400,000.
The IMF calculated that when it comes to debt-service-to-income (DSTI), median incomes in Hamilton haven’t kept up with the property prices. Before 2016, Hamilton household DSTI was about 30 per cent, but in the past three years that figure has risen sharply to almost 45 per cent.
Until early November, the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corporation (CMHC) had flagged Hamilton as a high-risk market, but said that beginning in August the situation began to cool down.
The CMHC report still rates Hamilton as having moderate risk of “overheating” and “accelerating” prices, but the agency lowered the valuation risks from moderate to low between the second and third quarter.
But RHAB’s own market data said that prices and sales went up again in October. “We started out the year in a much more balanced position than we experienced in 2016/2017, but the last few months have been favouring sellers,” Ms. Burrell said.
The IMF and the RAHB both posit some of the price growth is due to house-hunters sick of even higher prices in the Greater Toronto Area bidding up properties in Hamilton. But some local brokers don’t accept the Toronto invasion theory.
“We’re not seeing a tsunami of demand out of Toronto, primarily because of commute time,” which can be more than an hour to central Hamilton, said Judy Marsales, an independent real estate broker with 38 years of experience in the city. She said that while 2017 was a wild time, “The days of multiple offers and bidding wars are gone.”
Ms. Marsales said some of the median income to price disparity has to do with demographics; she sees a lot of seniors on lower incomes staying in homes, while younger families are able to take advantage of low interest rates and spend well above their income – sometimes perhaps too much to get into a house they want.
“There are times it is concerning, that judgment we leave to the financial people they deal with. They have more information on their financial capability,” she said.
But some mortgage professionals are also worried about what they are seeing in Hamilton.
“Whatever CMHC suggests, I assure you that those of us who deal with homeowners every day, we see debt stalking middle- to lower-class people,” said Ron Butler, lead broker for Butler Mortgage Inc. “We constantly hear of next generation Hamiltonians having to buy in Grimsby or Welland. And the existing residents often feel the effects of rising food, utility and gas prices and they generally earn less than those in the GTA.”
The IMF did say that other Canadian markets have recovered after prices decoupled from market fundamentals in the past, the most recent examples include Calgary and Edmonton between 2006 and 2012. But in those markets, income growth was strong and interest rates fell.
“The housing markets in Hamilton, Toronto, and Vancouver are not likely to benefit from such significant declines in interest rates. This could increase risks associated with rapid price corrections,” the IMF paper warns.

Detroit is new and improved – but for whom?: Dan Gilbert, the richest man in Michigan, put his wealth to use when his hometown needed it most. Today, the signs of renewal are clear – but so are signs of racial and economic inequality

Full text: When Dan Gilbert moved the headquarters of Quicken Loans to downtown Detroit in 2010, the city was hitting rock bottom.Art decoskyscrapers sat empty, long-shuttered businesses lined its main street along Woodward Avenue and the municipal government was spiralling toward bankruptcy.
Born in the city in1962,near the start of its decades-long decline, Mr.Gilbert and his arc had bent in inverse parallel to that of his hometown. A lawyer and realtor by profession, he co-founded the company that would become Quicken in 1985 and built it into a major lender, ultimately becoming the richest man in Michigan.
Along the way, the gruffvoiced, silver-haired entrepreneur developed a brash public persona.As majority owner of the Cleveland Cavaliers, for instance, he once famously excoriated LeBron James in an open letter when the NBA superstar decided to leave the team.
By Mr. Gilbert’s late 40s, it was time for the next chapter. He and 1,700 employees decamped from the suburbs to the city centre, bringing a sudden infusion of white-collar jobs to a struggling local economy. Then he started buying up buildings. Through his real estate firm, Bedrock, Mr. Gilbert took over more than 100 properties, mostly heritage buildings, refurbished them and brought in new offices, businesses and residents.
His motivation was a mix of business instinct and civicattachment. “I’m a fourth-generation Detroiter,”Mr.Gilbert,a wiry man with a slicked hairstyle and goatee, said at a Milken Institute event last year. ”It gets in your blood,in your DNA.”
Today, downtown Detroit is a place transformed. Along Woodward, high-end restaurants and new clothing stores jostle for space.Hipsters and office workers crowd bars and cafés in cobblestone alleyways. The two-year-old QLine, a streetcar whose naming rights Mr. Gilbert bought, trundlespast.
But this urban renaissance has also drawn tough criticism. For one,Quicken and Bedrock are accused of building an affluent island in the centre of a low-income city. While Mr. Gilbert’s spending has revitalized the central business district, much of Detroit remains economically distressed with neighbourhoods full of boarded-up businesses and burnt-outhouses.
Detroit’s racial divides factor in, too: Recent developments have tended to concentrate in the whiter neighbourhoods of a city where 79 per cent of the population is black.For another,Bedrock and its related companies have received US$767-million worth of government subsidies and tax breaks since 2010.Tosome,thisis an egregious use of funds when Detroit’s schools and transit system are struggling. Mr. Gilbert’s critics argue a man with a net worth For besestimates at US$6.8billion has no need for government assistance.
Whether Mr.Gilbert is the hero Detroit needed to pull it back from the precipice or an unaccountable billionaire wielding an uncomfortable amount of civic power, his rise represents an extraordinary moment in U.S. urbanism.
The rapid rebirth and future of one of the country’s greatest and most troubled cities rests largely in the hands of one man and his corporate empire, which is both animating the metropolis with its work force, and directly shaping the look and feel of its streets and buildings.
Just how central Mr.Gilbert has become to the city was thrown into stark relief this spring when he suffered a stroke. The health scare,which has required months of recuperation, transfixed local media and raised questions about what would happen in his absence.
But those close to him insist his work in the Motor City is just getting started.
Detroit has been through a particularly protracted urban unravelling.
A city that grew prosperous as the centre of automobile manufacturing watched its flagship industry move facilities to the suburbsin the postwar period,taking jobs and residents with it. Then, that industry steadily declined amid the globalization of manufacturing. Racial tensions, meanwhile, exploded over five brutal days in the summer of 1967.A police raid on an unlicensed bar turned into a riot that saw the army called in, 43 people killed, buildings torched and white residents fleeing to suburbia.
Corruption and mismanagement at city hall didn’t help matters.I none particularlye gregious case, Kwame Kilpatrick, mayor from 2002 to 2008, is currently serving a 28-year prison sentence for a scheme that traded government contracts for kickbacks.
From a peak near two million in the 1950s, Detroit’s population has fallen to fewer than 700,000.
This was the context in which Mr.Gilbert was raised.His earliest memory, he said at the Milken event, was of his father unable to go to work because of the 1967 riot. For much of his life, the only reason to trek downtown was for sporting events. And it was the context he was determined to change when he moved Quicken to a building on Campus Martius Park,Detroit’s central square.
But Mr. Gilbert didn’t stop there. Rather than simply bring employment to the city,he decided to build the downtown he wanted to see.”He had the capacity and the vision to think of it in a BigBang.He just said,‘We’re going to do it all. We’re creating jobs through Quicken Loans, we’re also going to create this entrepreneurial network, we’re also going to invest in retail on Woodward and we’re going to invest in residential,’ “said Bedrock CEO Matt Cullen at the company’s offices, whose hardwood floors, exposed brick and long communal workstation–allhousedinan1898formerhotelbuilding–betterresemble the digs of a tech startup than those of a property developer.
On seemingly every block sit Bedrock buildings, from the bright orange art-deco Stott skyscraper to the neoclassical Vinton Building to the Book Tower, an enormous 1917 Italianate edifice.
Quicken has also expanded exponentially, its local work force growing tenfold to 17,000 in less than a decade.
Bedrock has been careful to avoid the blunders of previous urban renewal efforts in Detroit – most famously the fortress-like 1977 Renaissance Center, cut off from the rest of downtown behind parking lots and grassy knolls. By contrast, Bedrock’s developments are designed for maximum connection to the city,with street-front retail and amixofuses. One block on Woodward, for instance, features the boutique Shinola Hotel along with two independent clothing stores, a restaurant, a craft-beer bar and apartments on the upper floors.
“We, as very large-scale developers, have a big portfolio, and with that comes a lot of power,” said Melissa Dittmer, the company’s chief design officer.”We have leadership in place who understands the power of that scale of portfolio and is trying to address inclusivity a cross all of it.”
The next step is to move from restoring existing buildings to putting up new ones. These include two massive mixed-use high-rise complexes on Woodward and Monroe avenues, and an expansion of Quicken’s headquarters.
There were other factors in Detroit’s rebirth,from political leadership that restored fiscal order at city hall to other corporate leaders who poured money into downtown developments. But Mr. Gilbert’s multibillion dollar spending has been key.”To have a major investor come in and buy up 70 per cent of the buildings in downtown, move its headquarters downtown, and make that kind of investment in one place, had the kind of momentum that was needed,” said Anika GossFoster, executive director of Detroit Future City, an urban-affairs think tank. “It required that sort of laser focus in one area.”
Petosky-Otsego is 15 minutes by carfrom the centre of Detroit,but the west-side neighbourhood feels a world away. Stately three storey homes sit empty, some with roofs caved in, others with interiors gutted. Champagnebrick storefronts are boarded up with weathered white plywood.
On some blocks, nearly every building has been torn down, leaving acres of urban prairie where grass and weeds grow wild.
Sonia Brown was raised here in the 1960s in the same white bungalow where she still lives. Over the years,all but two of the dozen houses on her block became vacant as residents moved away or faced foreclosure.
With a combination of donations and charitable grants, Ms.Brown, a health-care worker by profession,has startedbuyingthe homes and vacant lots along the street,fixing them up and turning them into DIY social services.
There’s a community kitchenand food pantry, a free health clinic staffed by volunteer medical students, an after-school tutoring program, community gardens and summercamps.
“This shows the ability to bring life back to something that was dying,” said Ms. Brown, sitting in the front room of one recently renovated house on a rainy September afternoon.”My grandchildren are now able grow up in that communities-unities concept that I grew up in.”
The city sorely needs her efforts.Detroit’s38percentpoverty rate is nearly three times the national average and median household income of US$30,344 annually is about half.
But Ms. Brown, known in the neighbourhood as Auntie Na after a diminutive of her middle name, Renia, is stridently against Bedrock or other corporate developers coming into the area.In her view, the new buildings rising downtown have nothing to offer her community and would only push people out.
“It’s the dollars that’s fixing to talk. The rest of us are about to walk.They’re putting us out of our own city,” she said. “I can’t afford that $180,000 home. I can’t pay $1,700foryourapartment.”
Herfearsarewellfounded.One city hall study estimates that as many as10,000unitsofaffordable housing could be lost in the next five years because of rising rents and condo conversions spurred bythecity’srevitalization.

“When I was growing up here, we had swim-mobiles, librarymobiles. People were in these places, people would use these places,” said Mr. Terry, a tall, bearded47-year-old,as he passed a string of vacant shops on Dexter Avenue, some boarded up and others with windows smashed and interiors stripped. “Now look at it.”
Mr. Terry runs two community organizations, All Four One and Pleasant Heights Economic Development,that aim to revive the area.His work has included building two parks with government grants and trying to match new businesses with city-owned repossessed properties they can take over. His current project is setting up a farmer’s market in a red-brick building with chipping green paint.
“The city is so focused on downtown.Over here,it’s been 30 years we’ve been basically told they’re going to do something,” he said. “I’m just tired of seeing the shucking and jiving.”
Mr. Terry points to the stark wealth and racial divides between the areas benefiting from the renaissance and those being left out: One downtown census tract, for instance,has a median house hold income of US$68,000, a median home value of US$188,000andapopulationthat is 52 per cent black. The census tract in which Ms. Brown lives, by comparison,has a median house hold income of US$21,000, a US$29,000 median home value and a population that is 93 per centblack.
Reverend Joan Ross,a community activist in the North End area, argues that the city and state have not demanded enough from Bedrock as a condition of subsidizing its developments.What good,she asked, are the company’s city building aspirations when 150,000 homes have been foreclosedonsince2002?
“We can take all of these tax subsidies to do that development, but we don’t have the foresight and the ability to create some kind of permanently affordable housing,”she said at the offices of WNUC, a community radio station where she has a show. ”All these incentives – corporate welfare.”
A city report from 2018 tallied public subsidies to Quicken, Bedrock and affiliated companies at US$766,759,061since2010.Ofthat figure, US$640-million came from direct government payments, calculated based on the tax revenues generated by the company’s projects,and the other US$127-million in the form of tax breaks. In one case, the company successfully lobbied the state government to set up a special fund for “transformational brownfield plans” so that Bedrock could apply for money from it.By comparison, Detroit’s budget for public schools is US$767-million,and for public transitis US$137-million.
A ProPublica report last month, meanwhile, highlighted Mr.Gilbert’seffortstobuildarelationship with U.S. President Donald Trump – including a US$750,000donationtohisinauguration – alongside a Trump administration decision to grant a relatively wealthy swath of downtown Detroit a special tax status meant to help low-income neighbourhoods. That status could boost the value of Mr. Gilbert’s holdings.
The city requires developers to sign Community Benefits Agreements with the neighbourhoods in which they build, stipulating specific things the company must provide such as parks or affordable housing. But some activists contend these do not go far enough.
“If you talk to Quicken, they’re going totell you that they’re doing something,” said Gloria Rivera, 76, an activist with the Detroit People’s Platform. “The question is,are you doing enough?” Laura Grannemann, a Quicken vice-president who oversees the company’s charity programs, standsinthelivingroomofanewly renovated house near Detroit’s northern boundary.

This house is part of Rehabbed & Ready, a program in which Quicken fixes up foreclosed homes and sells them back into the market to raise long-depressed property values for the city’shomeowners.
Another Quicken program pays off the back taxes on foreclosed houses that had been owned by scofflaw landlords,andsells the properties to tenants living there for between US$2,000 and US$6,000. A third helps low-income families apply for property tax exemptions in a bid to keep their homes.
“We have even more of a responsibility to be really active in that space,and we have a lot of talent to bear on this problem,” Ms. Grannemann said. “We have 17,000 team members who all, in some way, are touching housing relate dissues.”
Mr. Cullen allows that Bedrock has focused nearly all of its efforts to date on the central business district and has more work to do outside of it. The company, he says, plans to push further into the neighbourhoods.”Most of the great stuff that’s happened in the first five years of our resurgence is in seven to10 square miles downtown, and the city of Detroit is enormous–it’s140 square miles,” hesaid.
“You can’t have10 square miles of an ecosystem of 140 doing well and the rest of it failing and think that you’re going to be successful.”
But Mr. Gilbert’s team makes no apologies for tapping the public purse to help fund its work.
Jared Fleisher, his chief lobbyist, said Bedrock would never have built any of the projects that received subsidies without that money, because rents alone would have been too low to cover the costs of construction.The payments are a small price, he contends, for the additional tax revenue and economic development the properties are bringing in.The city’s numbers calculate that net tax from the projects, after subtracting the cost of subsidies, will be US$690-million.
“Gilbert is willing to take more risk with less return longer in the future than any traditional developer,” Mr. Fleisher said. “But that doesn’t mean he can go bankrupt.
That doesn’t mean these development scan lose money.”
A report commissioned by the Michigan state government on the single largest Bedrock subsidy – a US$618-million package from the Transformational Brownfield Plan – found that Mr. Fleisher is correct, at least to a point. The study, by Chicago-based development consultants SB Friedman, calculated that revenues from the projects,with out a subsidy,would indeed be too small to cover construction costs.
But the report also found Bedrock had significantly over estimated those costs.ItrecommendedthesubsidybecuttoUS$346.5million. Despite this advice, the state government approved the full US$618-million Bedrock wanted.
As for the special tax status conferred by the Trump administration on parts of downtown Detroit,Quicken contends it exerted no undue influence: All it did, Mr.Fleisher says,was take partinconsultations with the city and state on which areas should be suggested to the federal government for the program.
Ms. Goss-Foster, the urban-affairs expert, said the subsidies have been “necessary,” but the city and state have done too little to extract benef its such as affordable housing and heritage preservation in exchange.
Rather than a divide between downtown and neighbourhoods, or Mr. Gilbert and community bootstrappers, she argued, all of these elements have to work together.
“There is no one king here that’s sprinkling gold and paving streets for opportunity,” she said.
“We need everybody for that. We need all of the justice voices and we need the corporate leaders.” A CITY DIVIDED Detroit’s wealth and race divides are stark. Critics of Dan Gilbert’s revitalization efforts contend they have mostly helped a downtown that is wealthier and whiter than the city as a whole, while doing little for other neighbourhoods.
Detroit still plagued by vacant buildings Vacant property registrations as of October

Canadian developers face lawsuit from L.A. street artist: Tristan Eaton takes companies to court after University of Ottawa residence development uses his artwork in an ad campaign

Full text: A Los Angeles street artist is suing the builders of an Ottawa real estate development for allegedly misappropriating his art in an advertising campaign.
Tristan Eaton, who has worked for Nike, Versace and Barack Obama, launched a copyright-infringement lawsuit last month in Federal Court against a group of Canadian companies for using his stylized portrait of Audrey Hepburn in the promotion of an Ottawa student residence.
The case highlights the way the Copyright Act can be used to protect works of art, even if they are in public spaces.
It is believed to be the first time Canadian courts have been asked to weigh in on a copyright claim that centres on street art.
Teresa Scassa, a law professor at the University of Ottawa who studies intellectual property, said that the act generally allows for, say, tourists to take holiday snapshots without getting sued.
“The idea is that if a work is actually part of a landscape, then it’s not an infringement to take a photograph or to do a painting of that landscape,” Scassa said.
Architecture and sculptures that are permanently situated in a public space are explicitly mentioned in the act as not being copyright protected if reproduced in photos, she said. But street art, even if it is a permanent fixture on a building, is not mentioned in the law.
Eaton painted the original mural, called Audrey of Mulberry, on the side of a café in New York’s Little Italy in 2013. He said he painted the mural for free as part of a public art initiative organized by a local group.
Since then, he says, he’s seen the image pop up online, such as on unauthorized T-shirts, and in the real world, from New York street merchants to a shopping complex in Dubai.
“Trying to get them to stop is like playing Whac-A-Mole,” he said. “You stop one person, another person pops up.”
He said he learned about the incident in Canada when a friend drove by the new apartment building in July. The residence, Théo Ottawa, opened this fall and is mainly marketed toward students at the nearby University of Ottawa.
A cropped image of Audrey of Mulberry appeared on a banner hung on the outside of the building and in some of the development’s online and social-media posts.
After talking to the developers behind the building for weeks, Eaton and his lawyers filed a lawsuit on Oct. 30. It names seven companies that were involved in the building, including Katasa Group Inc. and Constitution Building LP.
Eaton is seeking $1.5-million in damages and other relief. He is also alleging a violation of his moral rights for not being credited as the creator of the art and for being associated with the corporate enterprise without his permission.
Lawyers from Gowling WLG who are representing Katasa and the other firms said a graphic-design agency had been hired and that firm delivered the work that allegedly violated Eaton’s copyright. The lawyers would not identify which design agency the developers were said to have hired.
“Constitution Building LP and its partners understood that the agency had obtained all necessary copyright permissions prior to the launch of the campaign,” the Gowling lawyers said in a statement. “Upon being notified of Mr. Eaton’s claims this past summer, immediate steps were taken to remove all instances of the artwork at issue from the Théo Ottawa advertising, which was completed in a matter of days.”
Lawyers for Mr. Eaton say that although the artwork was eventually taken down, it had already been on display for months.
“Our client wants to take a stand on behalf of artists,” said Paul Bain of Dickinson Wright LLP, who is representing Eaton.
“Just because something is out there, publicly, online or painted on a building, which takes a lot of time and skill, doesn’t mean it is free for anyone to exploit commercially.”
Bain said that, as far as he is aware, this is the first copyright case in Canada about street art that has involved court proceedings.
Eaton said he recommends all artists register the copyright of their works and be wary of unlicensed uses. “For me, my art is literally all I have,” he said. “This is my way of making a living. If that depreciates or gets devalued or abused, it will hurt my ability to make a living. So I have to protect it with all my might.”

Full text: RUTH ELISABETH emelia auguste KAJANDER C.M. M.D., Professor Emeritus, D.Psych., F.R.C.P (C).
(née Koeppe) 1924 – 2019 Dr. Kajander passed away peacefully in her sleep in Thunder Bay, ON, on November 8th, surrounded by loved ones, at the age of 95.
Ruth was born in Goettingen, Germany in 1924 to a family of physicists, engineers and physicians spanning several generations. At the time of her adolescence, it had become difficult to pursue pre-medicine studies in Europe; though determined, and emblematic of her stoicism, Ruth, with her mother’s encouragement, managed to bicycle out of Berlin the day Allied forces encircled the city. Ruth eventually arrived in Goettingen, her place of birth, to attend Giessen University, where she graduated from medical school in 1948. Four years later, after a sojourn in Finland, where she also attained her medical license, she arrived in Canada where she once more passed the medical licensing examinations. In 1958, after completing her studies at the University of Toronto, she became a specialist in psychiatry.
Ruth went on to marry Aatto Arthur Kajander, Q.C., and Honorary Consul of Finland, in 1957, with the promise of starting a life together in Port Arthur, Ontario, now Thunder Bay. Ruth and Art led a happy married life; later giving birth to their daughter Ann. Ruth enjoyed the outdoors including Finnish saunas, summers at Loon Lake and Kajander Lake, reading, travel, and art. Later on in her life, she particularly cherished the time spent with her grandchildren Arthur, Robin, and Maria.
For over 50 years, Ruth worked tirelessly to care for people with psychiatric illnesses in Northern Ontario. She was the founding director of the former Port Arthur Mental Health Clinic, and worked in both private practice and hospital settings. Early in her career, she was one of the first psychiatrists to recognize the value and use of chlorpromazine (Largactyl), an antipsychotic medication which greatly improved the lives of people with schizophrenia.
She was also the first woman to serve as President of the Ontario Psychiatric Association, the Thunder Bay Medical Association, and the OMA Section on Psychiatry. Ruth also served as a member of the Board of Governors at Lakehead University.
For her work in the field of psychiatry, she received the Order of Canada in 2011. Ruth was also bestowed the Order of the Lion, Knight First Class, one of the highest honours of the Finnish government, for her efforts in the Finnish community of Thunder Bay as wife of the local Consul. Many Finnish dignitaries and ambassadors were formally hosted at the house on Hodder Avenue.
Ruth was predeceased by her parents, Hanskurt and Else Koeppe; an infant son; her brother Herm; as well as her husband, Art Kajander, in 1998. She is survived by her daughter, Ann Kajander; her three grandchildren, Arthur Fiedler, Robin Fiedler and Maria Drohan; her brother, Peter Koeppe in Berlin, and other family in Germany and Finland.
At her request, there will not be a memorial service, but memories are welcome to be sent care of Ann at ann.kajander@lakeheadu.ca.
Memorial donations may be made to the Art and Ruth Kajander Merit Award - a scholarship at Lakehead University, the Thunder Bay Symphony, or another charity of your choice.

PATRICIA ANN KONRAD (Smith) 1944-2019 Patricia Konrad passed away peacefully, surrounded by love, at Soldiers Memorial Hospital in Orillia on November 8th after a lengthy and courageous battle with cancer. Predeceased by her parents, Ray and Vera Smith, her brother Thomas Smith, and sister-in-law, Linda. Pat will be lovingly remembered by husband Alfons; fur babies Dallas and Molly (woof!); nephew Geoff (Jill Cunningham); niece Kelly (Dave Krug); niece Kim (Paul Burroughs); nephew Eric (Esther); grandnieces and nephews Kristen, Trevor, Nolan, Samantha, Ethan, Ryan, Carla, and Mateo, as well as, her dear friend Nan Wilkins and many other friends and family.
As a young woman, Pat spent many hours on the ice dazzling audiences with her skating performances with the Ice Follies. After hanging up her skates she was admired for her business knowledge and exceptional skill in supporting senior executives at both Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts and at The Delphi Corporation with colleague and friend, Arnie Cader. However, it was her strong organizational skills, immense strength in character, interior design aptitude, love of dogs, and a refined sense of style that made her our “Pat.” It gives us great comfort to think she has rejoined her immediate family and the many dogs whom she loved with all her heart. From her longtime North York neighbourhood, to the shores of Lake Simcoe and the community of Lakewood Ranch in Sarasota Florida, memories of Pat will endure.There will be a private family interment. In lieu of flowers, please consider a donation to Orillia Soldiers Memorial Hospital or The Canadian Cancer Society in memory of Pat.
CONSTANCE MARY LANGSTAFF (nee Holland) 97 years young, Connie died peacefully on Sunday, November 3, 2019, at Belmont House.

In 1948, she married Jim Barr and later settled in Thornhill, a community she loved and lived in until 2010. Connie was a wonderful wife, mother, grandmother, great-grandmother, friend and neighbour. She loved entertaining family and friends and her Sunday dinners were legendary. Many turned to her for her wise counsel. When asked, she offered sound advice, but always with love and compassion.
In Thornhill, Connie and Jim raised their children and had a close circle of friends. Their backyard pool was a focal point for informal entertaining, family celebrations - always with several black labradors in attendance and surrounded by Connie’s beautiful gardens.
She never forgot a birthday, anniversary, graduation or other individual accomplishment and her small acts of kindness (and delivery of cookies) were appreciated by all.
After being widowed twice, Connie found love again, much to her delight, when she married Dr.
Jim Langstaff. His family was also very special to her.
For the last ten years, Connie lived very happily at Belmont House.
The family would like to thank the outstanding staff at Belmont, her devoted caregivers and her lifelong friend David who visited her every week.

Full text: 10 Bellair St., No. 406, Toronto YORKVILLE Asking price: $3,295,000 Selling price: $3,250,000 Previous selling price: $2,525,000 (2009); $1,465,420 (2003) Taxes: $16,457 (2019) Days on the market: Three Listing agents: Dino Capocci and Lauretta Stewart, Royal LePage Real Estate Services Ltd.
THE ACTION Earlier this year, this two-bedroom-plus-den corner suite was one of two properties listed in the upper $3-million range at No. 10 Bellair.
To gain a competitive edge, the price was dropped from $3.9million to $3.495-million and then relisted at $3.295-million in mid-July.
“Driving up the market was usually foreigners who decided to buy and pay top dollar to get in. But when you leave it to locals … they’re going to think twice about spending $3-million on a condo,” agent Dino Capocci says.
“A unit had sold three months prior for a higher price per square foot, so we tried to follow suit, but saw the market wasn’t there. So we did some price reductions.”
WHAT THEY GOT In a nearly 20year-old high-rise with luxury retailers at street level, this 3,000square-foot unit feels even larger with 91/2-foot ceilings, full-height windows and two balconies overlooking the Village of Yorkville Park.
Entertaining areas are clearly defined with French doors to a den and a gas fireplace in the living room. There is a formal dining area and a casual breakfast nook off the kitchen.
There are three bathrooms, a laundry room, a storage locker and two-car parking.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “It’s a big unit,” Mr. Capocci said.
“[Plus] the unit was beautiful with high-end finishes, high ceilings, two balconies, herringbone hardwood flooring and crown mouldings.”
Although monthly fees are steep at $3,105, but pay for more than utilities. “The amenities are one of the best in Yorkville and it’s a well-built building by Tridel,” Mr. Capocci said.
“They have second-to-none concierge and valet services, and a to-die-for pool, gym, courtyard, amazing guest suites and party room.”

Full text: 75 York View Dr., Toronto THE QUEENSWAY Asking price: $2.188-million Selling price: $2.1-million Taxes: $7,734 (2019) Days on the market: 11 Listing and co-op agent: Luisa Piccirilli, Re/Max West Realty Inc.
THE ACTION Agent Luisa Piccirilli was focused in late September on increasing traffic to this house by way of an online marketing campaign. Once there, many visitors were taken with the short commute to the Queensway’s shops, eateries, parks and ease of access to major highways.
“We had a lot of local buyers and also some people coming from Woodbridge and different parts of the city,” Ms. Piccirilli said.
“The big appeal there is the proximity to downtown Toronto and the airport, and also the great schools in the immediate neighbourhood.”
WHAT THEY GOT This roughly eight-year-old two-storey house on a 41-foot-by-133-foot lot has four bedrooms, an upper den and five bathrooms, plus a finished basement and interior access to the double garage.
The high quality craftsmanship is evident through small details and the arched portico, rich hardwood floors and intricate trim adorning two entertaining areas on the main floor. One of those spaces also has coffered ceilings and a gas fireplace.
The rear kitchen has granite counters, stainless steel appliances and double doors to a covered deck, patio, hot tub and private south-facing backyard.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “It was a custom home, built from the ground up, with a really nice lot and beautiful upgrades, so it didn’t have a stucco exterior, but stone and brick,” Ms. Piccirilli said.
“It had every upgrade you could possibly want in a house; it had a generator as well and all these little things that add up.”

Go west, homes are more affordable there: A cool-down in the Hamilton housing market means Torontonians can get more bang for their buck

Full text: After standing for some time as one of the Canadian cities most vulnerable to a housing market correction, Hamilton is no longer flashing red these days.
The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. (CMHC) recently lowered its risk assessment for Hamilton to “moderate” from “high.” Hamilton had been labelled with a “high” chance of a downturn since the end of the third quarter of 2016.
The mid-sized city west of Toronto saw a surge of buying in the earlier years of the decade as many buyers migrated there from more expensive areas closer to Toronto’s core. Artists and writers in search of cheap rent and studio space led the way. Soon, galleries and diners were opening up in Hamilton’s vintage storefronts.
“The pioneers who come out there change the neighbourhood as they move in,” says Tam Boyko, a real estate agent with Keller Williams Realty Solutions.
Ms. Boyko specializes in areas west of downtown Toronto – from Long Branch through Mississauga, Oakville and Burlington – and she has seen many buyers priced out of those areas continue to head west.
“It is expensive all the way to Burlington – let’s be honest,” she says. “I’ve helped people find a great solution in places they wouldn’t have looked.”
The market in Hamilton and surrounding suburbs cooled off considerably in 2018 – along with many others in Canada – as interest rates rose and the federal banking regulator introduced a mortgage “stress test” that made it harder to some potential buyers to qualify for a loan.
CMHC says that property values in “The Hammer” and its surrounding suburbs now better reflect local economic conditions.
CMHC is basing its assessment in part on data collected to the end of June.
“Right now, the market is very slow,” Ms. Boyko says.
Less than $600,000, properties are still moving briskly, she says, but above that mark, buyers are quite hesitant, she says.
Last week, Ms. Boyko helped a couple purchase a move-up property in Long Branch in the $1.2million to $1.4-million range.
The house was priced at about market value and offers were welcome any time, she says.
The house had been on the market about one week when the couple decided to make an offer.
In that area, inventory is low and demand is high, she says.
A little farther west in the Clarkson, Lorne Park and Mineola areas of Mississauga, the traditional homes on large lots are taking longer to sell.
“There are some beautiful houses that have just been sitting,” Ms. Boyko says.
She believes that the low inventory is one reason that buyers aren’t willing to step up. People who don’t find exactly what they’re looking for will wait for more listings to become available – especially above $2-million.
“It’s still a lot of money if it’s not the right house,” she says.
Houses with asking prices between $1.3-million and $1.6-million in Mississauga will go quickly, she says.
Ms. Boyko says the uncertain market also makes it hard for buyers to decide how much to offer on a property.
“I think when people are confused, they don’t do anything.”
In Hamilton, buyers with a smaller budget can find a house in the Crown Point area around the $460,000 level, Ms. Boyko says.
Even houses that have been fixed up are reasonable compared with Toronto prices, where $600,000 buys an entry-level condo with no parking and no locker.
“You can get a nice house in Hamilton for under $600,000,” she says.
According to the Realtors Association of Hamilton-Burlington, sales in the area rose 6.4 per cent in October from October, 2018.
The average price for residential properties jumped by 7.1 per cent to $602,029 last month from the same month last year.
The number of new listings, meanwhile, dropped 8 per cent last month compared with October, 2018.
Ms. Boyko currently has a house listed for sale with an asking price of $919,000 in the St.
Clair neighbourhood of Hamilton.
The red-brick Victorian at 89 Delaware Ave. – which Ms. Boyko has simply dubbed “the Delaware” – was divided into three suites at one point, but now it has been restored as a three-bedroom 3,500-square-foot single family home.
Ms. Boyko says people who visit the open house events from the Greater Toronto Area are surprised at the square footage they can buy in Hamilton.
“People come into the Delaware and they can’t believe the price. From their perspective, it’s crazy.”
Still, she says, the house has been on the market for about three weeks because people with that kind of budget often try to remain closer to Toronto.
“They’re not coming out to Hamilton looking for a million-dollar house.”
The Delaware house has also attracted many neighbours to the open house weekends during its three weeks on the market, she says.
“They’re curious and they’d love that price point to be achieved,” she says.
She points out the house on Delaware would make a good house for a group of friends who want to buy together and each have their own suite. The extra kitchens have been removed but the plumbing is still there, she says.
“Does everybody need a kitchen? Maybe some people don’t even cook. In this economy, you may have to embrace some different ideas in order to live grand.”

A big renovation for a small-town home: Spacious house feels like a cross between cottage and farmhouse, with room to grow

Full text: 2950 Lobsinger Line HEIDELBERG, ONT.
Asking Price: $700,000 Taxes: $4,552 (2019) Lot Size: Half-acre Agents: Jamie Kubassek, Remax Twin City Realty THE BACK STORY Tell a prospective home buyer that you’ve got a large century home that has been faithfully and tastefully renovated and restored, has a huge lot and is below nearby market comparables and they’ll have just one question: What’s the catch?
In the case of 2950 Lobsinger Line, what is one buyer’s catch might be the another buyer’s strongest selling point: It’s located in the village of Heidelberg, which is a little less than 10 minutes north of Waterloo, Ont. In census 2016, the town’s population was 666 people.
“You don’t have to sell people on the house, you have to sell people on the town,” said listing agent Jamie Kubassek, with Re/ max Twin City Realty. He sold the house to its current owners, lives in another nearby small town himself (Conestogo) and sells quite a few houses in the small villages that ring the Kitchener-Waterloo city region.
“You have to have people who are small-town people … it’s not everybody’s cup of tea.”
For Jane and Steve Warner, it was the exact flavour of tea they wanted 20 years ago: a big house to raise their four children in.
They come originally from the Owen Sound area, have lived on farms and in small towns, and they wanted something with that pre-1900s charm. Not that there weren’t years of work to get it to this state: The interior of the house had undergone a “modernization” in the 1970s that did everything from lower the ceilings to replace all the panelled doors with flat featureless slabs.
“We did a lot of contextual renovation, sensitive to the history of the house,” said Mr. Warner, who transitioned from a career in music to run a mini Airbnb empire in recent years. “We got from a friend a bunch of old baseboards from a barn, and had that installed.
“We did put an addition on the side of the house … a sunroom/ dining room. The biggest compliment we get is it looks like it’s been there a long time … the [exterior] saw-toothed trim and cornices and brackets, we had all that reproduced” by local Mennonite craftsmen.
The children have mostly moved out, and Steve and his wife, Jane, a chiropodist who has an office next door and in Elmira, hope another big family wants to live in small-town Ontario. That said, they do wonder how a young family could afford to buy in the village. The region is booming, and property prices are high in part because there’s been a restriction on new subdivisions in order to protect farmlands.
“There will be no more growth in Heidelberg,” Steve said. Their son moved to even-more rural Palmerston looking for affordable housing options.
THE HOUSE TODAY Like many of Ontario’s small villages, the oldest houses in Heidelberg are right on the main road, and Lobsinger Line (a.k.a. Regional Road 15) can be a busy route (the nearby town of St. Jacobs is a popular draw). The traffic out front is just as likely to be horsedrawn carriages as summer cruising motorcyclists and pickups and family packed SUVs.
But while the front yard may deal with traffic, the backyard is almost a half-acre lot, including a vintage barn. Mr. Kubassek said that can be another disincentive for people who might romanticize acreage they’ve never had, until they can see up close how much lawn that is to cut or rake.
The house is a muted yellow brick with deep green trim, very common features in the area.
There are two front doors, but the one on the covered porch opens into a central foyer. To the right is an updated kitchen with maple countertops (made by those local craftsmen) new cabinets and an island with seating. Through the kitchen is the addition (more on that below).
Left from the front door is a grand living room with Mr. Warner’s grand piano in the bay-window nook, the focal point of many a carolling and sing-a-long session from those family events.
Marble fireplace, pale floors, stolid and thick mouldings and trim give it the feel of an update on an 1890s parlour.
In the back of the house is smaller lounge, with a stand-up piano and another fireplace; this is the less-formal living room.
Next door is a big mudroom combined with a laundry room that backs onto the rear deck (with hot tub). Faux-wood tile for durability, more wood panelling for that modern-country feel.
There’s also a powder room on this level, with a full soaker tub.
The house has two bathrooms and four bedrooms, which must have been interesting with four kids and two adults.
The staircase upstairs starts in the kitchen hallway (thick railing, solid posts and that deep-brown farmhouse stain). Two of the four bedrooms on this level have lofts for storage (a feature that probably wouldn’t work in a house with anything less than 10-foot ceilings.) There’s a walkout balcony deck looking over the rear yard here, too.
The main bathroom on this floor is recently updated, black and white checkerboard tile, shower tub and fluted ceramics.
The house has one more surprise in the basement: Underneath the addition is what feels like a 1950s diner, a space built for the kids with exposed wood, black and white tile, a bar area with vintage fridge, a red leather sectional couch and a home entertainment centre with a projector for video games or movies. It’s the kind of games room you might find at a resort, not in Mennonite country.
FAVOURITE SPACE The whole house feels like a mix between cottage and farmhouse, but the sunny addition is on a different scale. It seems almost too big for its use: The dining-room table sits in the middle of a vast tiled floor – oversize rectangular tiles with underfloor heat – surrounded by windows that cover three-quarters of the space between ceiling and floor.
The shared wall with the kitchen is the old exterior to the house, and the brick is exposed here. A three-piece chandelier dangles over the table, a big fan on the ceiling probably helps for those August afternoons. Two armchairs share an ottoman in the corner, and there are a couple side tables along the red walls that can’t dim how bright it all is.
The Warners’ host a lot of Christmas and family functions, and this room is flexible for multiple uses. Even though it’s new, they went all out to make it feel older.
“When we were putting in the light switches, we ordered pushbuttons,” of the type introduced in the early days of electrification, Mr. Warner said.

Sabia to step down as CEO of Caisse: After nearly 11 years, pension fund boss to leave in February to head Munk School

Full text: Michael Sabia is stepping down from his post as chief executive officer of Canadian pension fund giant Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec after a decade at the helm, leaving an institution once marred by crisis on stable footing but with several looming challenges.
The former BCE Inc. head said Tuesday he will be the longestserving Caisse CEO when he leaves the job in February to lead the University of Toronto’s Munk School of Global Affairs and Public Policy.
Mr. Sabia said the time is right to depart because the Caisse’s portfolios are proving resilient amid global market swings while the pension fund’s global footprint is well-advanced. Two thirds of its assets are invested outside Canada.
He denied he was at odds with Premier François Legault’s government and said he is leaving on his own terms. The Munk opportunity was some time in the making, he said, adding the university was willing to wait until he felt comfortable leaving the Caisse.
“This is a team sport, this isn’t about me. [We’ve] built an organization that is positioned well in the world, that is performing on a very solid basis,” Mr. Sabia said.
“There’s always things to do but generally I think things are in very good shape here. And so it’s time to get on with [this new opportunity]. … At some point you say to yourself, you’ve got to be disciplined, time to move on.” Mr. Sabia, 66, has led the Caisse through four changes in Quebec government, navigating the politically sensitive waters by defending the Caisse’s decision-making independence while boosting investments in local companies and real estate. He has always insisted that the best way to stoke Quebec’s corporate champions is by making them world beaters.
He will leave the job roughly a year ahead of the formal expiry of his mandate in March, 2021. He had said in recent months that he would not remain as Caisse CEO past that time, even if asked to stay.
“In doing this, he stays master of his own destiny,” said Louis Hébert, a management specialist at business school HEC Montréal.
“He came in when there was lots of turbulence and questions being asked of the Caisse. He’s stabilized the situation and put in place processes” to withstand downturns, he said.
Mr. Sabia joined the Caisse at a low point in its history in March, 2009, and his appointment was not without controversy at the time. He was an outsider – a St.
Catharines, Ont.-born anglophone and a former senior federal civil servant who had previously served as CEO of BCE Inc., the parent of Bell Canada.
His predecessor Henri-Paul Rousseau, a banker, had been recruited to clean up the institution, which manages money on behalf of Quebec public pension and insurance funds, after it posted poor results coming out of the dot-com meltdown. Mr. Rousseau departed in May, 2008, and replacement Richard Guay lasted just a few months.
That year, the Caisse booked a $40-billion loss as it sustained heavy losses in the value of its investments in stocks, real estate and private equity after markets crashed globally that fall.
Once in the door, Mr. Sabia moved swiftly to restructure the management team, book heavy writedowns in the company’s real estate business and reorient its investment strategy by focusing on assets anchored in the real economy. By the end of 2011, the Caisse’s assets under management were finally back to where they’d been four years earlier, at $159-billion.
He has since delivered steady if unexceptional returns, averaging 9.9 per cent annually in the past decade and more than doubling the Caisse’s asset base to $326.7billion as of June 30.
While the Caisse under Mr. Sabia has become a far more global investor – just 36 per cent of its assets are now in Canada, from more than 50 per cent – it has also worked to live up to part of its founding mandate to support the Quebec economy.
The Caisse led efforts to build and operate a new light rail system in Montreal and has made high-profile investments in the province’s technology sector, including leading a $200-million financing of artificial intelligence startup Element AI. It has also financed expansion efforts of local champions including CGI Group and Laurentian Bank.
There are several unresolved challenges for the pension fund, including what to do about its sizable investment in beaten-down engineering firm SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. But progress on those challenges is being made, Mr. Sabia said. “I don’t see in any of those files flashing red lights or solid red lights.”
Quebec’s political leaders were effusive in their praise for Mr. Sabia and what he’s been able to accomplish at the Caisse. Mr. Legault singled out his “exceptional track record.” Economy Minister Pierre Fitzgibbon said his rigorous management pushed the pension fund manager “to another level.”
The Caisse’s board has begun the selection process for the next CEO and has hired an international consultancy to help in the search. The Caisse board recommends a candidate to the government for approval.
Speculation about who would take over from Mr. Sabia is already well under way in Quebec’s corporate and political corridors of power. External candidates whose names have been linked to the job include National Bank of Canada CEO Louis Vachon and Sophie Brochu, who is leaving her job as CEO of energy firm Energir at the end of the year. She would be the first female CEO to lead the Caisse were she to be selected.
“The government is always in a hurry to name people. They undoubtedly have a candidate in mind,” said Michel Nadeau of Montreal’s Institute for Governance of Private and Public Organizations, himself a former Caisse senior executive.
Influential in government and business, Mr. Sabia, although not an academic, is a respected leader and an ideal candidate for a school that seeks to make an impact beyond academia. University of Toronto president Meric Gertler said one of the tasks entrusted to Mr. Sabia will be to look into whether the Munk School should become a separate faculty unto itself.
“We were looking for somebody who could act as a bridge between the great academic work being done inside the university and the school of global affairs and public policy and the realm of application,” Mr. Gertler said. “Michael brings tremendous credibility in both of those worlds.”

Full text: Brookfield Property Partners LP is putting renewed focus on its roots in Canada after spending years building a huge portfolio of foreign real estate holdings, saying it is now seeking investments in Canadian hotels, apartments, offices and large-scale development projects.
The Toronto-based company has appointed Ashley Lawrence to lead that effort, which will see Brookfield join a crowded field of deep-pocketed investors all chasing similar assets in the country’s booming regions of Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal and Ottawa.
“My mandate was to grow and to expand, especially in sectors that we are not in,” said Mr. Lawrence, a 43-year-old Canadian who returned to Toronto in June, 2018, to fill a new position as regional head of Canada after managing Brookfield’s retail property division in New York for two years. “We have certain things we are looking for. Not every deal has them. In order to find them, you have to evaluate a lot of deals in the market,” he said.
Brookfield has about US$194billion in assets under management around the world. Its Canadian assets total US$9-billion – 4.6 per cent of its portfolio – consisting mostly of two dozen offices in Ottawa, Calgary and Toronto.
They include First Canadian Place, a 72-storey tower in Toronto’s financial district and the tallest office building in the country. Mr. Lawrence wants to add to that, and the company is currently constructing a third tower to its Bay-Adelaide office complex in downtown Toronto.
In comparison, Brookfield has US$137-billion in assets under management in the United States, US$31-billion in Europe and the Middle East, US$14-billion in the Asia-Pacific region and US$3-billion in Brazil, according to its most recent investor presentation. That includes a significant collection of malls and rental apartments throughout the U.S., part of the Canary Wharf business hub in London and a sizable office and residential development in Dubai.
“As we have grown globally, we have gone into a lot of sectors that we are not in in Canada,” Mr. Lawrence said.
Brookfield had always planned to increase its Canadian footprint, according to the company, but did not find the right openings. Since he has taken the new job, Mr. Lawrence has doubled the size of the Canadian investment team to cover more ground and find exclusive deals. “In order to do that you have to spend a lot of time out in the market, talking to people, making relationships,” he said. “It takes time and effort.”
But as Brookfield seeks to move into other property types, especially in rental housing, it will be competing with pension funds, real estate investment trusts, as well as local and global developers for a piece of the action. A flurry of multiresidential development is taking place in Toronto and Vancouver and their nearby suburbs, owing to a housing shortage and soaring home prices. However, Mr. Lawrence believes Brookfield will make a big mark in the country’s urban centres.
“It takes a long time to get these developments out. These are not coming in the next 24 months. This is 10 [to] 15-year horizons,” he said. “We are relatively patient in terms of finding the right opportunity.”
With corporate headquarters moving to downtown Toronto along with the growth of tech companies, the city’s commercial property market has been on fire for nearly a decade.
That has driven up land prices and spurred interest in large patches of land such as Bombardier’s airport property, which was sold to a Canadian pension fund in 2018 for just over $800-million.
Recently, Brookfield was a contender for East Harbour, 38 acres of mostly vacant land east of Toronto’s financial core, according to a source, who was granted anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. But it lost to Cadillac Fairview, which plans to build 10 million square feet of office space.
Mr. Lawrence would not comment directly on Brookfield’s interest in East Harbour but said: “Any large parcel of land that comes up, we would be interested. We are a long-term believer in the city of Toronto and its growth.”
Mr. Lawrence said there there isn’t a specific amount of capital dedicated to Canadian acquisitions. But given Canada’s smaller commercial property market, he said Brookfield is willing to do deals in the US$30-million to US$40-million range. On the flip side, Mr. Lawrence suggested there are no limits.
Brookfield Property can use its own capital, as well as financing from parent company Brookfield Asset Management’s third global real estate fund, which raised US$15-billion earlier this year. “We like to put out larger amounts of capital,” he said. “That being said, we do like building businesses where the initial amount of capital may not be as sizable. But over time, as you build out that business, as you add assets, they get to that scale that makes sense to us or strategically.”

When a small business gets taxed like a condo tower

Full text: A ftershocks from the housing boom are sweeping over small businesses in the urban cores of Vancouver and Toronto as soaring land values drive up assessments and, in turn, trigger annual increases in property taxes running into tens of thousands of dollars.
Those higher taxes are a significant hit on the bottom line of retail businesses operating on slender profit margins. For some, it means the prospect of closing. The years-long rise in prices for residential real estate is at the heart of the problem.
Land values soared, not just for housing, but for commercial properties as well. Higher home prices also led municipalities to take steps to expand the supply of housing, including changes to zoning that allow residential uses in formerly commercial areas.
Together, those two factors set the stage for steep and sudden increases in official estimates of the “highest and best use” of a property, and in tax bills.
Assessors use the principle of highest and best use – the building and improvements of a property that create the highest value – based on a number of considerations, including market demand and legally permitted uses.
The key point is this: The highest and best use may not be the building that currently exists.
In areas with rapid growth, such as the urban cores of Toronto and Vancouver, the highest and best use could be a condo tower or townhouse development, which means the owners of such properties face much higher assessments and a much higher tax bill.
Vancouver’s Kitsilano neighbourhood is full of one- and twostorey retail storefronts that give the neighbourhood a throwback appeal, making it home to precisely the sort of businesses that are most vulnerable. Sabrina Faas, owner of Bayswater Tea Co.
in Kitsilano, says the annual tax bill for her three-person business has climbed by nearly $10,000 since 2016, one more financial burden to shoulder. In essence, her 1,265-square-foot shop is being taxed as if it had a residential building atop it. Or as, Ms. Fass puts it: “I’m paying for air.”
Ms. Faas estimates she would need to increase her revenue by more than $25,000 to cover that additional cost. But she has limited room to raise prices, so most of the higher tax bill will come out of her bottom line.
Five kilometres to the east, The Beaumont Studios faces even starker consequences.
Founder and executive director Jude Kusnierz says her not-forprofit business renting space to artists may have to start winding down. The tax bill skyrocketed to $110,000 in 2019 from $46,000 four years ago; the studio’s financial plan forecasts another $18,000 increase in 2020. Ms. Kusnierz says she hopes Vancouver city council will deliver some tax relief, but without it, the business that expanded over 15 years and grew into a second building will have to close.
The softening of the B.C. real estate market in the past two years temporarily reduced the upward movement of assessments in Vancouver, says Paul Sullivan, senior partner at the real estate consulting firm Burgess, Cawley, Sullivan and Associates Ltd. But he says land values would have to plummet drastically for the tax increases to roll back.
And now, the real estate markets in Toronto and Vancouver have rebounded, meaning the upward pressure on assessments will resume.
In Toronto, veteran restaurateur Frédéric Geisweiller has run headlong into the tax distortions the highest and best use principle can wreak. Mr. Geisweiller, one of three owners of Le Sélect Bistro in the city’s downtown, has watched condos sprout up near the restaurant and its property tax bills skyrocket.
When the bistro moved to Wellington Street 12 years ago, the property taxes were just $31,276.
By 2016, that had risen to $60,131. But over the next three years, the bill nearly doubled to $116,000 – and that was after City of Toronto put a cap in place in 2018. Without it, the bistro would have had to pay $150,028 in 2019.
Mr. Geisweiller says he welcomes the city’s efforts at tax relief, but they aren’t nearly enough. In the low-margin restaurant business, Le Sélect Bistro would need $1.1-million in additional sales to offset even its reduced tax bill.
Toronto’s 10-per-cent cap on yearly increases just delays the day of reckoning, he says. The bistro’s property-tax bills, already unaffordable, will continue to rise.
“There is no end in sight,” Mr. Geisweiller says.
Without tax relief, he says, Le Sélect Bistro will have to close after more than four decades in business, putting its 80 employees out of work.
Brian Kelcey, vice-president of policy and public affairs for the Toronto Regional Board of Trade, says he believes hundreds of Toronto businesses face the same magnitude of tax increases as Le Sélect Bistro. Lawvin Hadisi, press secretary for Toronto Mayor John Tory, said the surge in property taxes is “solely and directly” attributable to increases in assessments by Ontario’s Municipal Property Assessment Corporation. MPAC says it calculates assessments based on permitted uses and on land-use policy set by the province and municipalities.
The problem is even more widespread in Vancouver, with more than 4,000 commercial properties facing tax increases of at least 10 per cent in 2019, with some seeing bills triple, says Aaron Aerts of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB).
In British Columbia and Ontario, business groups are pressing their provincial governments to give municipalities the fiscal flexibility to deliver long-lasting tax relief. In Toronto, Mr. Kelcey, councillor Joe Cressy and others are asking the Progressive Conservative government to allow the city to exempt properties from a highest-and-best-use assessment unless the owner has an approved development permit – a clear indication a new structure is planned.
In B.C., a coalition that includes the CFIB, Vancouver and other municipalities is pushing the New Democratic government to pass legislation that would allow local governments to establish a new class of property taxes to shield small businesses from the impact of rising land values.
Both provincial governments have promised to study the issue. In its economic update this week, Ontario said it will seek input on measures to “enhance the accuracy and stability of property assessments.”
In the meantime, small businesses across Toronto and Vancouver will have another year of punishingly big tax bills.

DARK SIDE OF THE BOOM: AN EXPLOSION OF U.S. TV AND FILMMAKING IN TORONTO IS SQUEEZING CANADIAN CREATORS OUT OF THE PICTURE, SIMON HOUPT WRITES

Full text: A cluster of black limousines gleamed in front of a sprawling warehouse near Toronto’s Pearson Airport the other day, an incongruous vision of glitz along a dull industrial stretch of road.
Once upon a time, the low-slung building served as a primary distribution hub for the Canadian operation of Kraft Heinz, sending millions of tubs of peanut butter and KD mac & cheese out across the country. On this day, though, dignitaries nibbled on finger food crafted in a more refined key – braised beef short ribs with a maple-bourbon demi glaze; pan-seared cod with a Champagne yuzu sauce – while stars from the TV shows Star Trek: Discovery and In the Dark strolled a red carpet.
Bonnie Crombie, the mayor of Mississauga, stepped excitedly to the microphone and welcomed the guests to her burg on the western edge of Toronto, which she called Studio City North: “I like the sound of that!”
she beamed.
Crombie had reason to be enthusiastic. In less than 12 months, workers had retrofitted the old Kraft operation with 20,000 sheets of drywall, 21,000 soundinsulation panels and 42 kilometres of wiring, transforming it into CBS Stages Canada. The state-of-the-art TV and film facility, boasting six sound stages totalling 260,000 square feet, is the first dedicated production hub in this country for CBS Corp.
It is also the latest arrival in a galloping expansion of studio space under way in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA). By early next year, Mississauga alone will have 700,000 square feet of space across five studios. “These investments will put our city on the international map for film and television, and inject a renewal of excitement in our creative industries sector scheme,” Crombie promised.
The unprecedented expansion is fuelled by an arms race among U.S.-based streaming services stockpiling an arsenal of programming to snag subscribers.
Deep-pocketed combatants making TV in the GTHA include Hulu (The Handmaid’s Tale), CBS All Access (Star Trek: Discovery), Netflix (The Umbrella Academy, Titans) and Amazon (The Boys, The Expanse).
Employment in the sector is booming: Ontario Creates, a government agency which facilitates media production in the province, says the industry now supports approximately 37,000 fulltime jobs, up more than 15 per cent from 32,000 jobs in the summer of 2018. Vic Fedeli, Ontario’s Minister of Economic Development, Job Creation and Trade, declared that the CBS studio, which will employ about 300 local craftspeople when fully booked, demonstrated the province is “open for business.”
But as foreign business floods in, Canadian creators – who already struggle to get their projects made and seen in a marketplace of slick Hollywood product – are being squeezed as never before. Local suppliers are tied up serving U.S. companies, spurring growing concerns about a branch-plant industry smothering local talent. And while more studios are being built, there is still more demand for space than there is supply, leaving local TV producers and filmmakers priced out of the market as they try to get Canadian stories in front of the cameras and out to audiences.
Even owning a studio doesn’t necessarily help. In the spring of 2018, Bell Media, which owns the CTV and CTV2 broadcast networks as well as dozens of specialty channels, purchased a majority stake in Pinewood Toronto Studios, currently the largest studio complex in the country. But Randy Lennox, the president of Bell Media, says the company is shut out of Pinewood for the foreseeable future, because the studio was already booked up before the purchase with shows such as Star Trek: Discovery, which runs in Canada on Bell’s newly rebranded CTV Sci-Fi (née Space) channel.
“We can’t get in,” Lennox told The Globe and Mail in a recent interview. “It’s a squatter’s rights situation. Star Trek: Discovery is a massive undertaking at Pinewood for us.”
“It’s great that the show keeps getting renewed,” he added. Still, he had hoped to make Pinewood “a community offering,” where both Bell Media and Canadian independent producers can make their own content. That will have to wait.
According to data provided by Ontario Creates, the increased production activity in the province is due almost entirely to what is known as foreign location and service (FLS) productions: shows that are shot here with Canadian crews and technicians, but are not considered to be Canadian content because Canadians do not occupy enough of the key creative positions, such as writer, director, producer or lead acting roles. The stories are almost never set in Canada.
Such foreign productions increased approximately 23 per cent over two years, jumping from $847-million of spending in Ontario in 2016 to $1.04-billion in 2018; domestic production, meanwhile, rose a mere $5-million over the same period, to $847-million. The foreign-domestic split has gone from 50-50 to 55-per-cent foreign versus 45per-cent domestic in just two years.
That mirrors a growing imbalance between foreign and domestic production that is even more pronounced across the country. A report issued last spring by the Canadian Media Producers Association indicated that foreign production in Canada had risen 26 per cent from 2017 to 2018, to approximately $4.8-billion, while domestic TV and film production had fallen approximately 9 per cent in the same period, down to $3-billion.
(That latter figure does not include in-house production of domestic broadcasters.)
The increase in foreign spending, and the frenzy for studios, crews, locations, and other support services, is pricing Canadian creators out of the better facilities – and even Toronto itself.
“It is a bit of a bummer, in terms of certain vendors that we’re used to going to that we’ve created relationships with over the years suddenly being not available or able to help us out, because Netflix is in town shooting 15 things,” says producer Lindsay Tapscott. Last year, she and her producing partner Katie Nolan opted to shoot the indie drama The Rest of Us in North Bay, lured there by the provincial government’s Northern Ontario
Heritage Fund, which rebates 50 per cent of a production’s local spending, up to a $500,000 payment.
In a sign of mounting concerns, last summer, the federal Department of Canadian Heritage initiated a study of the effect of foreign location and services production activity on the domestic production industry. The results are expected later this fall.
Toronto-based production manager Robbie David says the squeeze is hurting his ability to do business. “I’m turning down shows right now, because I’m not going to be able to get a studio,” said David, whose credits include the Canadian TV series Mary Kills People and the feature American Woman, which premiered at last month’s Toronto International Film Festival. “This has been a problem for the last three years, and it gets worse – not every year, it gets worse every few months.”
David says the industry’s top priority should be new studios.
“They’re building them in Toronto. But you can’t just concentrate on Toronto anymore, it has to be all over Ontario.” That’s because the cost of studio rentals is tied in large part to the value of the underlying real estate. With the cost of land in Toronto continuing to rise, other locales are jockeying, trying to offer themselves up as legitimate alternative production centres.
Lennox told The Globe that Bell Media’s Canadian version of RuPaul’s Drag Race will shoot in Hamilton when it begins production this month. “I have four shows [shooting] in Ontario, none of which are in Toronto, for the precise reason it’s not affordable – commensurate to the level of production that I’m speaking of,” he explained.
The province hopes conditions will improve over the next few years as another dozen or so production facilities come onstream, helping to double the studio space in Ontario from 2.3 million square feet last year to as much as 4.6 million by 2022.
(Pinewood is in the middle of adding 200,000 square feet to its main campus in Toronto’s Port Lands area.) Still, there is no guarantee foreign demand won’t soak up all of the extra supply.
And even as construction continues, Canadian productions sometimes have to settle for the crumbs. Justin Cutler, the Ontario Film Commissioner with Ontario Creates, acknowledged that well-financed U.S. companies have tied up some of the highest quality studio space: Netflix, for example, has leased eight sound stages in two downtown Toronto facilities, totalling about 250,000 square feet.
“Ontario Creates has worked hard with some of the companies that have taken long-term leases, to understand when those stages are going dark [temporarily],” Cutler explained. “We’ve worked very closely with Netflix over the last month to get that stage availability back into the hands of domestic producers.”
Looking for a longer-term solution, David joined a handful of industry players to form Aeon Studio Group, which last June announced a memorandum of understanding with the city of Hamilton to build a massive multiuse development on what are known as the Barton-Tiffany Lands. The city-owned site in the West Harbour area has a checkered history that includes heavy industry that likely left the land contaminated, requiring remediation. In 2010, the city demolished a handful of buildings there in hopes of constructing a new stadium for the Hamilton Tiger-Cats CFL team. But that wound up being built elsewhere, and the site has now sat desolate for almost a decade.
If the city and Aeon can agree on terms of a land purchase, the company hopes to build up to 500,000 square feet of studio space in what it is calling the Hamilton Studio District, a development that would include housing, retail and offices, and that councillors hope would help spur the city’s creative renaissance. Aeon intends to open its first studio space, converting an existing building for 150,000 square feet, by next summer. By the time the development is complete – in anywhere from five to 20 years – Aeon expects it will support about 1,000 direct and spin-off jobs.
“We believe the quality of the facility we plan to build will make this attractive for productions, even if they have to spend an extra 20 minutes driving [from Toronto],” said Jeff Anders, one of the partners of Aeon.
After all, he explains, while studios are essentially commodities – landlords build and then rent out large, empty shells on a series of short-term leases – the quality of spaces can differ enormously. They depend on such quotidian factors as ceiling height (which can proscribe lighting possibilities and the size of sets) and the spacing of structural pillars: a restriction that can frustrate production designers.
“When we analyze the full stock of space [in Ontario], we think that half of the capacity is forgettable. It’s either too lowceilinged, there are pillars throughout, sound attenuation isn’t there, vibration control isn’t there,” he explains. “As a province with about one per cent of the global [TV and film production] market, I’m saying we could have and should have more.”
He admits there may be some insurmountable hurdles, including the cost and logistics of site remediation. “There are still a lot of unknowns on the financial side of things. We believe this is a viable project. But it remains to be seen.”
Back in Mississauga, Armando Nunez, the president and chief executive of CBS Global Distribution Group, played down concerns that Canadians might have about the explosion of American content swamping Canadian creators and their stories. “Hasn’t that ship sailed?” he asked rhetorically, in an interview with The Globe. “I mean, through technology, you can be swamped by any content from any place in the world.”
“We’ve always been sensitive to the idiosyncrasies of Canada as a market, and Canadian cultural sensitivities,” he added.
“That is something over the years we’ve had conversations with our broadcast partners about.
But at the end of the day, the fact is that Canada has warmly and enthusiastically embraced American content – irrespective of where it gets made.”
Fedeli, the Ontario minister and MPP for the riding of Nipissing, in Northern Ontario, says it doesn’t bother him if this country’s creators have to go outside of the major centres to make Canadian stories. He sees Toronto as a place where Canadians get trained on foreign productions and then work on smaller, domestic stories in places such as Parry Sound or his hometown of North Bay. “For Toronto, you really need this big horsepower of CBS,” he said, during an interview with The Globe on the Chicago-set CBS soundstage of In the Dark.
Still, he added, “In the North, from our perspective, we really like to see the more home-grown productions.” He pulled out his phone and flipped through photos of the new outdoor set in the municipality of Powassan of When Hope Calls, a spin-off of the Hallmark Channel series When Calls the Heart, which is being made for Hallmark’s streaming service. “They’ve built an entire town!” he marvelled.
Certainly, places such as Powassan and Hamilton seem eager for the attention and business, prompting some Canadian creators to adapt their stories to the new locales. Filmmaker Atom Egoyan set his new film in Hamilton in part because he says he believed it would be logistically easier than if it were to take place in Toronto. Guest of Honour, which premiered at the Toronto International Film Festival last month, centres on a restaurant inspector who sometimes creates false health infractions in order to exert leverage over restaurateurs.
“On a very practical level, we needed access to a lot of restaurants, and in Toronto, a lot of those restaurants would not want to be identified with a food inspector who’s coming in and finding faults: things that are not up to code,” Egoyan told The Globe.
In Hamilton, however, “there was an openness. People were just so excited we were shooting there, so they weren’t so stuck up on that. The places we went to in Hamilton were able to see: It’s a story. They were just very open to us being there.”

Full text: In the make-believe world of the 1963 film The Great Escape, Steve McQueen played a heroic baseball-playing American. While the story of the mass escape from a prisoner of war camp during the Second World War is true, that character never existed at the North Compound of Stalag Luft III. In real life, Canadian officer Bill Paton was the star pitcher on the baseball team at the POW camp, and while the Germans watched them play, the prisoners secretly scattered earth from the tunnels on the ball field.
Flight Lieutenant Bill Paton, who died in Toronto on Oct. 25 at the age of 101, was one of the last Canadian survivors of the Great Escape. The RCAF officer was not one of the 80 men who made it out through the tunnel in the largest Allied prison break in the war. Only three of the escapees, two Norwegians and a Dutch airman made it out of occupied Europe; the rest were recaptured.
The Great Escape infuriated Hitler, and he ordered the survivors shot; 50 of them were murdered, six of them Canadian.
There were about 800 Canadians at the camp, and all of them were members of the Escape Committee. Anyone who signed up for sports, baseball, hockey or even boxing, was automatically a member. Sporting events distracted the German guards, who loved watching Canadians play sports, especially boxing.
The Great Escape was 11 months in the planning.
The camp was for captured Allied airmen, mostly British, Canadian and from other Commonwealth countries, along with a few Americans and those of other nationalities. It was operated by the Luftwaffe, the German air force, near Sagan in Silesia, in what was then the southeastern part of Germany; today it is Zagan in Poland.
Ted Barris, a Canadian author who wrote the bestselling book The Great Escape: A Canadian Story, says the Allied airmen were treated relatively well in the camp, in part because the head of the Luftwaffe, Hermann Goering had been a pilot in the First World War.
That gave them the limited freedom they needed to carry out the construction of the escape tunnels. Baseball and other sports were part of the ruse.
“Since plenty of the officers had played international or professional sports, including … Phil Marchildon and Bill Paton, the sports grounds at the North Compound buzzed with tournaments,” Mr. Barris wrote. “But beneath that veneer remained a secret society of officers – about a third of whom were Canadian – intent on breaking out of the camp.”
William Edgar Paton (pronounced PAY-ton) was born in Toronto on July 27, 1918. His father, James, was a printer who specialized in calendars; his mother, the former Josephine Beeny, was a housewife. He grew up on Bastedo Avenue in the east end of Toronto.
At Riverdale High School, Bill Paton was a star pitcher on the baseball team and after graduating he played for semi-professional teams.
“He played semi-pro in the Beaches [a Toronto neighbourhood]. He played there before and after the war,” his son John says.
Mr. Paton joined the Royal Canadian Air Force in August of 1941.
Like many volunteers, he wanted to be a pilot, but when the RCAF discovered he was a math whiz, they suggested he become a navigator, since having a quick mind with numbers was essential in plotting flights between England and occupied Europe.
After training in Western Canada, under the Commonwealth Air Training Scheme, Flight Sergeant Paton was sent to England, where he was assigned to 431 Squadron, flying Wellington bombers out of Yorkshire. The Wellington was a twin-engine aircraft, and it was relatively slow compared with the four-engine “heavy” bombers, the Halifax and the Lancaster, which were just arriving in service for Bomber Command.
By the time of his seventh mission, he was a Pilot Officer, the lowest commissioned rank in the RCAF. On the night of April 16, 1943, his Wellington took off from the field in Burn, Yorkshire. It was shot down over Hochspeyer in Rhineland, in the west of Germany. The tail gunner was killed, and the five crew members who survived were taken as prisoners of war.
Plt. Off. Paton landed in a tree and injured his hips, which would bother him for the rest of his life.
His immediate problem was an angry German woman whose son had been killed in an Allied bombing raid. She tried to stab the Canadian officer with a pitchfork as he hung by his parachute in the tree. The injuries on his face from landing in the tree can be seen clearly in the photo on his prisoner of war ID card.
Plt. Off. Paton spent 25 months in detention as a prisoner of war.
For almost a year, he and the other inmates worked on an elaborate escape plan. The tunnels were known as Tom, Dick and Harry.
Some of the prisoners worked digging tunnels, others including Plt.
Off. Paton were called “stooges,” charged with security, making sure the tunnels were not discovered. The guards looking for signs of escape were known as “ferrets.”
“The stooges were beating the ferrets at their own game,” Ted Barris wrote. The camp commandant suspected a breakout was coming but did not know how or when.
Then there were “penguins,” whose job it was to disperse the dirt. Plt. Off. Paton was also a penguin, finding ingenious ways of dumping it.
“The biggest problem they had was getting rid of the dirt from the tunnels. They used to have these pants that had pockets, and they would release the earth. Which is why they started playing baseball and football as a way to get rid of the earth on the fields without the Germans really noticing,” says his son John, who spent seven years putting together a book on his father’s war experiences. “I spoke to people in Austria and Poland. One [German] historian, Uwe Benkel, did quite a bit of research on Dad.
He even found parts of the plane.
We still communicate back and forth.”
On the night of March 24, 1944, men dressed in civilian disguises, with false identification papers made by a Canadian forger, started to leave through the narrow tunnel. They came out on the other side of the wire. Eighty of them made it out into the woods that surrounded the camp before the escape was discovered. Four were captured right away at the tunnel exit. All but three were captured, and 50 were murdered on direct orders from Adolf Hitler, their bodies cremated and buried outside the camp.
As the Soviet Red Army closed in on Germany, the prisoners were marched out of the camp in late January, 1945. On Feb. 4, 3,000 prisoners from Stalag Luft III arrived at another camp in Marlag in the west of Germany. British troops liberated Plt. Off. Paton and others just weeks before the end of the war.
“He had to go back to England for a medical checkup and debriefing before he could come home,” his son said. By the time he arrived in England he had been promoted to Flight Lieutenant, the equivalent of Captain in the Army.
After the war, he returned to work at Canada Life, where he became the manager of mortgage services and was a star on the company baseball team. He married Marie Russell in 1948.
Flt. Lt. Paton continued to be a semi-professional pitcher and was hired by local teams. His son John remembers him planning the family vacation around his baseball games. The family would go to Orillia in time for an annual baseball tournament at Couchiching Park.
“Every morning at the cottage, he would practise pitching, and I would catch. Then he went to the tournament, dressed completely in black, and teams would come up and offer him money to play for them,” John Paton said.
Flt. Lt. Paton retired when he was 63, and he and his wife spent winters in Florida, in a community called Maple Leaf Estates. Always a great athlete, he took up golf. When he was in his early 80s he “shot his age,” that is, he recorded 80 strokes in an 18-hole game, considered quite an achievement. He scored five holes-in-one.
He was alert until the end of his life, though his wartime hip injury caused him to be in a wheelchair for the last few years.
Flt. Lt. Paton leaves his wife, Marie; their children, John, Gordon and Beverley; and six grandchildren.

Full text: We’re driving Croatia’s D8 highway, heading north along the Adriatic coast from Cilipi Airport. It could be any rural highway, until the turn where Dubrovnik’s old city comes into view. A few minutes down the road, we reach our rental apartment.
It’s on a hill that overlooks the marina, port and Elaphiti islands. To the southeast is the old city – walled in the medieval era, shelled in 1991-92 during the Croatian War of Independence and repaired afterward.
Through the turn, our driver chuckles.
“Some tourists ask me if the city was built by HBO – they ask what we will do with it now that the series is over.” He discusses Dubrovnik’s complicated relationship with tourists. Good for the city. No, not good. Lucrative. Their money helps the economy, he says. But many pass through without knowing much about Dubrovnik except that it was King’s Landing in Game of Thrones. But we can be friends with him, he offers, since we aren’t fans of the show.
The fans, he says, arrive in droves.
Overtourism is a problem in Dubrovnik.
Too many visitors, too fast, strain the locals by way of rising consumer goods prices and residential accommodations turned into Airbnb rentals that put pressure on real estate costs. Tourists also contribute to climate change.
According to the World Tourism Organization, travel for leisure accounts for roughly 5 per cent of global CO2 emissions, largely propelled by air travel. This year, local airport traffic here is up 20 per cent so far, with 315,000 travellers arriving by air in May alone to visit the “Pearl of the Adriatic.”
Then there are the cruise ships. In 2017, the city swelled by nearly 750,000 visitors from these vessels; the year before, the Mayor of Dubrovnik asked locals to stay home to combat dangerous overcrowding from the cruise liners. These behemoths are known as floating cities. They are notorious polluters, wreaking havoc on air quality, emitting carbon like a Dickensian smokestack and dumping, as Forbes reports, “trash, fuel, and sewage directly into the ocean.” As a contributor to environmental degradation and climate change, the tourism industry is in a macabre dance of death with itself. As the academic journal Nature noted last year, the old city of Dubrovnik is at risk of significant flooding because of rising seas. Indeed, roughly 40 sites along the Mediterranean are staring down rising waters, including Venice, Italy, Tyre, Lebanon and the Medina of Tunis in Tunisia.
My two travel companions and I will feature in the city’s June numbers. The day we arrive is sweltering because of this summer’s extraordinary heatwave in Europe. We feel each of the 36 degrees as we walk to the old town. The day before we were in Venice, which is also suffering from overtourism. I was there for research: a visit to Project MOSE, a series of massive underwater gates meant to prevent catastrophic flooding of the city and its surroundings. I’m working on my second book. It’s about the end of the world: threats to civilization, to the survival of humankind, including extreme weather events, fires, floods, and droughts, each of which is hastened and worsened by the CO2 emissions that make tourism possible.
I get to travel the world for this book, visiting cities and sites where the effects of a warming planet are already pronounced or where efforts are underway to forestall or mitigate those effects. I’m part of the problem.
Flying from Ottawa to Rome. Driving to Venice. Later this year, off to the United States, Russia, Kazakhstan, Egypt. Perhaps the Arctic. Will the words I write produce a return on the carbon investment, externalized and so also paid by others, required to produce them? I hope so.
There are things that I can do to minimize my carbon and tourism footprint.
Travel less and visit less popular destinations. Pack lightly. Buy carbon offsets (all the rage again, in part thanks to flight shame – personal or social embarrassment related to flying caused by a recognition of the environmental impact of taking to the skies). Nudge family and friends to do the same. In recent years, I’ve adopted, with some success, a mix of the first three tactics. This year, I’m adding carbon offsets and nudges. I think of these schemes the way I think about tipping in restaurants – if you can’t afford to tip, you can’t afford to dine out.
Whatever I do to reduce my role in climate change and overtourism, it won’t be enough on its own. Same for you. Collective-action problems are structural and collective conundrums require structural and collective solutions. You can implore individuals to fly less, turn off the air conditioning, eat local, recycle and just generally do their part – and that’s fine and good and necessary – but people respond to incentives and trade on habit, short-term impulse and social cues. If flights and cruises are affordable, plentiful and socially acceptable, people will take flights and cruises. If commuting by car is cheap and convenient, we will commute by car. If industry is permitted to pollute with impunity, industry will pollute with impunity. If we are permitted to decarbonize slowly, to burn oil and gas cheaply, then we will decarbonize slowly. That’s the trap.
The future of tourism cannot look like its past if there is to be any future for tourism. Those of us who shuffle around and those who govern or sell to us ought to make that the guiding principle of an industry that must immediately evolve to become carbon-footprint conscious and sustainable. That effort will take a mix of regulations, technological innovation, industry practices and social norms.
It’s a tough way to live, doing carbon calculus day to day, hand-wringing while wondering if your efforts make any difference, wondering if there’s any point if others aren’t doing their part. Government, industry and the tourism community need to develop an environment within which individuals can live sustainably and in which they can be ethical travellers, paying the full and true cost of their movement. But individuals shouldn’t be let off the hook. We ought to work to save ourselves from climate change and preserve the destinations we visit for future generations – and future television series.

Full text: F or about 20 years, the boxes sat in the storage room of Michael Hayden’s Vancouver home, unopened. He had found them in a basement room behind the garden of his father’s home in Cape Town, South Africa, after his sudden death in 1984. They had been shipped there, originally from Germany, and had never been opened by his father either, not since the boxes had arrived after the Second World War. There were about 15 of them, all from the 1940s. The information inside would give Hayden – one of the world’s foremost geneticists – a new purpose in life.
“I could feel the gravity of what was in there,” Hayden, 67, says. “I knew there was going to be a big burden and an obligation to come from opening them. And I wasn’t ready. I think I was fearful, too. I knew this was going to be a burden, and a very personal burden.”
Gertrud and Max Raphael Hahn, Hayden’s grandparents, were wealthy residents of Gottingen, Germany, a university city that has been home to dozens of Nobel Prize laureates. Max ran a successful business that included a leather factory and a real estate empire; the Hahns owned about 40 per cent of the buildings in the town. They were prominent members of the Jewish community – Max was president of the synagogue – and deeply patriotic Germans: Max had been a senior procurement official for the German army during the First World War.
And they were great collectors – of art, fine furniture, antiques – and a collection of Judaica that is said to have rivalled those of the Rothschilds and Sassoons.
At about 2 a.m. on Nov. 10, 1938, Nazis armed with axes broke into the Hahn home, smashing doors and windows, destroying their belongings and forcing Max and Gertrud half-naked into the street, while bystanders hissed and yelled, calling them “filthy Jews” and “pig Jews.” Their home was ransacked and many of their possessions were stolen.
This horrific night became known as Kristallnacht – the night of broken glass – a government-sanctioned series of Nazi pogroms in Germany and Austria that saw hundreds of synagogues burned, Jewish businesses destroyed and Jewish cemeteries desecrated. There were dozens or hundreds of deaths (the number is disputed) and some 30,000 Jewish men sent to prisons and concentration camps.
Max was one of them.
He was sent to jail for nearly nine months, during which much of his property, including his silver Judaica collection, was confiscated. The family also sold possessions to the local museum, under duress, as they were stripped of their wealth and livelihood.
Even while in prison, Max worked for the return of his prized Judaica items, thinking they could help fund the family’s future life somewhere outside Germany. He was not successful.
There were more pressing concerns. In 1939, the Hahns managed to get their children, Rudolf and Hanni, 19 and 17, to safety in England. In early 1941, they shipped some precious items that remained, including a piano and violin, and many documents to Sweden and Switzerland for safe storage in neutral countries.
By the time Max and Gertrud tried to leave Germany themselves, later that year, it was too late. In December, 1941, they were deported by train to a concentration camp in Riga, Latvia. Gertrud, who was diabetic and without her medication, may have died on the way in the cattle cars. It’s believed Max was shot in the Bikernieki Forest in March, 1942, and buried in a mass grave, like thousands of other murder victims. No records of their deaths exist.
Michael Hayden grew up without grandparents. He had a vague notion that they had been killed during the Second World War, but he knew no details about their deaths and very little about them.
Those boxes, left unopened for all those years, held answers to questions he didn’t know he had.
One night in the mid-2000s, at around 3 a.m., he went down the stairs of his Vancouver home and started opening them. He’s not sure what compelled him that night. Was it his state of mind?
Was he ready to confront the past?
Did his curiosity finally win out over his fear? In any case, he felt ready to know more.
The containers held thousands of documents that painted a rare and urgent picture of life in Nazi Germany for a prominent Jewish family – his own.
Inside, Hayden found about 50 letters sent during the war between Max and Rudolf; petitions that Max had submitted in response to anti-Semitic laws enacted by the Nazis; and photographs and lists of the art and other objects that had been stolen from the Hahns or sold under duress while under Nazi rule.
Hayden, who doesn’t speak German, hired a historian who is fluent in the language to help him deal with the contents. The documents were a treasure trove of information about his family, but they also contained clues – and evidence – about his grandparents’ stolen property.
That’s when he decided he would search for it.
The first time Hayden visited Gottingen, it was long before he knew about the boxes – or much of anything about his father’s life. He was in his 30s, travelling with his father. They visited a childhood friend of Rudolf’s, who was very welcoming. It was the first time Hayden had ever heard his father speak German. The man brought out a photo album from their shared childhoods. There they were as kids. Then, a few pages in, there was a photo of his father’s friend, in an SS uniform.
Since opening the boxes, Hayden has been working with the Gottingen Museum and other German institutions for several years, looking for what is left of his family’s treasures. There have been a lot of obstacles – restitution can be a fraught endeavour – but a few dozen items have been identified as having belonged to the Hahns. Last year, in a moving ceremony, the first of these treasures was returned – a remarkable silver gilt kiddush cup – one of very few items of Judaica seized by the Nazis that had not been melted down for the precious metal. The cup was discovered in a basement vault at a Hamburg museum in 2018 and returned to the family last November.
“I felt a sense of great triumph and justice,” Hayden says. “It was a great occasion to restore that and to give some respect to [my grandfather] and an item that I knew he loved and he must have handled.”
In three-dimensional silver, the cup depicts three scenes from the biblical story of Jacob. The date of its carving, 1757, is engraved on the base. There’s a rude red number splashed next to it, assigned by one of its Nazi thieves.
This is one of the items being displayed for the first time at an exhibition that opened on Friday at the Vancouver Holocaust Education Centre. Treasured Belongings: The Hahn Family and the Search for a Stolen Legacy includes many extraordinary items that belonged to the Hahns, including a 17th-century Passover Haggadah and precious secular art, such as an original work by the artist Max Liebermann.
The museum was interested in creating the exhibition not just because of the Hahns’ compelling, tragic story, but also because of the contemporary resonance.
Their story is a lens through which to view reconciliation and repatriation in the aftermath of catastrophic injustice.
The show also includes historical context, as well as family photographs and original letters. In one, written right after Kristallnacht – Nov. 11, 1938 – Rudolf, writing from Hamburg, tries to comfort and encourage his mother back in Gottingen. He ends it with a quote. “We will not let this get us down!”
Michael Hayden is a world-renowned medical researcher who has accumulated many titles and accolades over the course of his career. He is the founder and director emeritus of the Centre for Molecular Medicine and Therapeutics at the Department of Medical Genetics at BC Children’s Hospital and the University of British Columbia, and Killam Professor and Canada Research Chair in Human Genetics and Molecular Medicine. He is one of the world’s leading experts on Huntington’s disease. He has been named to the Order of Canada, the Order of British Columbia and the Canadian Medical Hall of Fame, as well as many other honours. When I asked him about if he has unwittingly inherited characteristics from the grandparents he never knew, he paused and then said yes.
“And some of it is deeply comforting. Because I’m a deep collector and partly what I’ve done, in the eighties I started collecting DNA and body parts from patients who died of certain genetic diseases. And I did it very methodically. Today we have the largest DNA bank and organ bank in the world that is supporting global research into Huntington disease.”
He also collects other things – including, similar to his grandfather, Haggadot (the books used during the Passover Seder).
What motivates Hayden’s quest for his family’s belongings is not financial restitution – or even the lost items themselves. He was eager to learn about Max and Gertrud and illuminate their identities, their individuality.
“I’m really driven from a perspective of wanting to rescue my grandparents from obscurity and wanting to restore them to their particularity and distinctiveness and to rescue them from complete anonymity,” he says.
“These were just two of six million, my grandparents, but for me I wanted to get away from generalizations. … I’m really just trying to understand: What’s the genetic legacy? What’s the legacy of courage and personality? Who were these people? And giving them a face.
“That’s what’s driving me. And somehow it’s also a search for who I am.”
Treasured Belongings: The Hahn Family and the Search for a Stolen Legacy is at the Vancouver Holocaust Education Centre until Nov. 27, 2020.

Full text: The high-altitude Toronto condo market appears to be losing some thrust.
“I definitely am seeing some momentum taken out of the market,” says Christopher Bibby, a real estate agent with ReMax Hallmark Bibby Group Realty Ltd.
Mr. Bibby works mainly in the segment for hard lofts and luxury units in downtown Toronto.
In most cases, the purchasers are buying their next home.
Those people are taking their time.
Mr. Bibby says the hordes of potential buyers still exist; he senses they are increasingly cautious about inking a deal.
“I’ve worked in markets like that – where people just aren’t coming,” he says.
But in the fall of 2019, his office is booking record numbers of appointments to visit properties for sale.
There’s a high volume of people shopping; what the purchasers lack is a sense of urgency, he says: “I’m seeing ‘days on market’ increasing in certain buildings.”
This week, the Toronto Real Estate Board reported that condo sales in the Greater Toronto Area rose 5.1 per cent in October compared with October, 2018. The average price of a condo unit increased 9.6 per cent last month compared with the same month last year.
Sales of detached houses in the GTA, meanwhile, jumped 19.6 per cent last month while the average price of a detached house gained 3 per cent.
Mr. Bibby says some buyers are seeing better value in single-family dwellings and questioning the record prices that some condo units are fetching. In some cases, people are looking to downsize from a four-bedroom house into a two-bedroom condo – and the condo is the more expensive property.
“I think there’s more value in the homes that we see – and I’m a condo guy.”
Unit owners looking to sell, meanwhile, have become used to high-octane growth and feel deflated if they don’t set a new milestone for the building.
“Nobody wants to sell for less than the last sale,” he says.
Mr. Bibby recently sold a unit with an asking price slightly below $1.1-million. The unit is in a coveted building where the sellers expected to have a deal signed in a week. The sale took three weeks and the unit sold under asking.
While Mr. Bibby understands the frustration of sellers who always want to move the peg higher, he points out that, ultimately, consumers decide on the fair value for a property.
He adds that many owners have done extremely well – in some cases tripling their investment.
He also says the more balanced market works in favour of buyers.
He worked with one downsizing couple recently who were interested in a two-bedroom unit near Yonge Street and St. Clair Avenue with an asking price of $1.5-million.
The sellers trimmed the asking price when the unit didn’t sell after a few weeks.
Mr. Bibby advised his clients that they were in a strong position to negotiate, considering that the unit had been on the market for 40 days and the sellers had just reduced the list price.
The buyers were able to strike an agreement at $75,000 less than the owners were originally asking.
“We still negotiated on the reduction,” he says. “That was the reality of the market. We were the only buyers at the table.”
At a less rarified level, investors, speculators and first-time buyers can’t get their hands on properties quickly enough.
Below about $1.1-million, Mr. Bibby is seeing a surge in interest from investors. Many are local residents who are planning for retirement by shifting money out of the financial markets and putting it into an income property, he says.
Some are buying one-bedroom condo units while others are opting for single-family homes.
The appetite for preconstruction condo units is also phenomenal, he says. “The demand is higher than I’ve ever seen it.”
Manu Singh of Right at Home Realty Inc. says demand for condo units in the core remains extremely high, in the $600,000 to $1-million range.
Mr. Singh recently sold a twobedroom, two-bathroom condo unit at 209 Fort York Blvd. in a five-way contest.
Unit 971 is a corner unit with updated decor and a southeastfacing view toward Lake Ontario.
Mr. Singh set an asking price of $799,000 and held off offers for seven days.
One “bully” tried to pre-empt the bidding process with an offer on the second day. The sellers spurned that offer but a couple of days later another agent called with a client who also wanted to bully.
“That means there’s significant demand for this type of unit,” Mr. Singh told the owners, who decided to wait for the planned offer night.
The strategy paid off because they received another four bids and accepted an offer of $900,000.
Mr. Singh says two-bedroom units in that price range are very desirable to people who want to live in the building.
The final price, which equals about $858 a square foot, compares very favourably with downtown preconstruction units which sell for $1,200 to $1,400 a square foot – and sometimes more.
Because of that gap in prices between the resale market and the preconstruction market, Mr. Singh is recommending that his clients look at existing units.
He says buying a property where the purchaser can analyze comparable recent sales and determine how much rent units are fetching is less risky.
“From a purchasing standpoint and a leasing standpoint, you have the numbers right in front of you.”
He likens speculation on preconstruction to gambling because there are so many factors at play.
“Most sophisticated buyers would say, ‘I’m buying into the future – there’s uncertainty – I should be rewarded with a discount.’ ” Looking ahead, Mr. Singh doesn’t see condo prices coming down in the winter months for entry-level and mid-range units.
“My clients are asking me, ‘Is there going to be a discount in December or January?’ I’m just not seeing it,” Mr. Singh says.
The higher end offers more room for negotiation, he says.
Mr. Singh says many of his clients who own income properties in the $600,000 to $999,000 range are reluctant to list them for sale because they don’t want to leave any money on the table by selling too soon.
“The investors are hesitant because they’re trying to figure out where the top of the curve is.”
Mr. Bibby says that for now condo prices remain in the stratosphere. He thinks continuing single-digit sales and price growth is a more likely scenario than the blistering double-digit returns of years past.
“I think the question we all ask ourselves is, ‘Will this continue?’ ”

Full text: The housing markets in Toronto and Hamilton have become less overvalued and no longer have a high degree of risk, Canada’s federal housing agency says.
The Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. downgraded its risk assessment of both markets to “moderate” from “high” Thursday, saying that home values now better reflect local economic conditions. That leaves Victoria as the only metro area with a high degree of vulnerability. Over all, the Canadian housing market has a moderate risk rating for the third consecutive quarter.
“The [housing] imbalances were more acute a year ago than they are today,” CMHC chief economist Bob Dugan told The Globe and Mail in an interview.
“We’re seeing some healthy adjustments” in larger cities that had been especially vulnerable in recent years.
CMHC’s evaluation was based, in part, on data as of the end of June. Since then, Canada has seen a pickup in home buying – particularly in Toronto and Vancouver, where affordability concerns persist – suggesting some markets could find themselves under greater pressure in the future.
As part of its quarterly report, CMHC evaluates the national market and 15 urban areas on four criteria: overheating, or when sales greatly outpace new listings; a sustained acceleration in prices; overvaluation, or when prices are higher than levels supported by economic fundamentals; and overbuilding. CMHC assigns one of three overall risk ratings – low, moderate or high – to indicate how vulnerable a housing market is to a price correction.
The Toronto area was moved to a “moderate” risk rating for the first time since the second quarter of 2015. CMHC said that overvaluation concerns were lower, pointing to “declining prices” against a backdrop of growing incomes and population.
That said, the Toronto market appears to be gaining momentum.
In October, Greater Toronto home sales increased by 14 per cent from a year ago, with the average price growing by 5.5 per cent, the strongest rate of growth since late 2017, according to the Toronto Real Estate Board. In 2018, the market cooled considerably in the wake of various provincial and federal regulations aimed at tamping down frenzied activity.
The Hamilton area is back at “moderate” risk for the time since the third quarter of 2016. In its assessment, CMHC said home prices were “more closely aligned” with economic fundamentals. In recent years, Hamilton has experienced a considerable amount of overflow demand from those priced out of Toronto, resulting in rising sales and prices.
Meantime, the Vancouver area has a moderate risk rating for the second consecutive quarter. Prior to that, it had been flagged with a high degree of vulnerability for 12 consecutive quarters, coinciding with rapid price inflation.
CMHC said Vancouver showed moderate signs of overvaluation, but also noted “lower home prices in different segments of the resale market and growth in economic and demographic fundamentals have narrowed the imbalances.”
Recently, the Vancouver market has started to rebound from moribund activity. In October, Greater Vancouver home sales were up 45 per cent, compared with 2018, although the benchmark price was down 6 per cent and currently sits at just below $1-million.
CMHC also gave a moderate overall rating to the Edmonton, Calgary, Saskatoon, Regina and Winnipeg areas.
Low risk ratings were given to the Ottawa, Montreal, Quebec City, Moncton, Halifax and St.
John’s areas.

Two approaches to redeveloping public land: How Toronto developers are mixing affordable spaces into their new project proposals

Full text: A Friday Real Estate story about the redevelopment of a Toronto District School Board site at Bloor and Dufferin indicated that the property was sold by the Toronto Lands Corp., which manages the board’s lands. The owner of the site is actually the board, not the TLC. Also, the TLC did not participate in an October mediation session between a residents group, the city and the developer.

Call this a tale of two publicly owned redevelopment sites.
Late last month, City of Toronto officials unveiled a major revitalization of a Toronto Community Housing site, with Context Developments and RioCan teaming up to re-build an aging affordable housing complex at Queen East and Coxwell, near Woodbine Park. The site’s density, according to TCHC, will go from 120 to 750 units. Of those, 120 will be designated “deeply affordable” another 100 will be affordable rental and 180 will be market rental. The balance of the apartments will be sold as condos.
Although located between Leslieville and the Beaches neighbourhoods, the project’s most conspicuous feature is the mix of tenure types and price levels.
“I don’t see this as being a luxury location,” said RioCan REIT president and chief operating officer Jonathan Gitlin. “This community didn’t need that and didn’t want that.” The council is expected to vet the plan in the spring, with occupancy planned for 2023.
In the west end, meanwhile, Metropia and Capital Developments are pushing for council sign-off on a plan for a much larger swath of public land – a 7.3-acre parcel at Bloor and Dufferin streets that is home to Kent Public School and Bloor Collegiate Institute.
The developers are proposing 2,034 market residential units (three-quarters will be one- and two-bedroom apartments) in five towers.
However, the plan calls for just 56 deeply affordable rental units, relegated to a small structure proposed for a corner of the site and accounting for less than 2 per cent of the floor space in the entire project. The application goes to council later this year, and the developers have already filed a pre-emptive appeal to the Local Planning and Appeals Tribunal.
As governments seek to dent the escalating affordability crisis in costly cities such as Toronto, local politicians are increasingly interested in leveraging publicly owned real estate as a means of promoting a wider housing mix on redevelopment sites – not just condos and subsidized apartments, but also purposebuilt rental complexes geared toward a range of incomes. As Mr. Gitlin noted, investor interest in the rental sector has grown in recent years; indeed, RioCan’s expanding residential rental portfolio now includes a tower near Yonge and Eglinton.
In some locations, portions of redeveloped public land will actually remain in public hands, as property-management firms and non-profit housing providers enter into long-term leases with municipalities to operate apartment buildings.
Yet, in other cases, this laudable policy goal has proven illusive.
The Bloor-Dufferin property – a highly desirable parcel located steps from a subway station, amenities and a popular park – is a case in point.
It is owned by Toronto Lands Corp., the agency tasked with managing the Toronto District School Board’s extensive real estate holdings. The site was deemed surplus almost a decade ago, which meant it could be sold, with the proceeds used to offset the TDSB’s capital budget requirements.
In 2016, Metropia/Capital submitted the winning bid in a request for proposals to purchase the property; the agreement automatically expires at the end of this year if the developer fails to secure council approvals to proceed with the redevelopment.
While Toronto Mayor John Tory touted the Queen/Coxwell TCHC site as an example of the city’s strategy to fast-track more affordable rental units on publicly owned sites to help alleviate Toronto’s housing crisis, the Bloor-Dufferin project has drawn local criticism, albeit not the more typical type of “not-in-myback-yard” reaction that often greets large-scale-intensification schemes.
In this instance, a coalition of area residents and non-profit housing providers say the city is forsaking an opportunity to add more affordable units on a prime site.
“We’re just really disappointed that the city is taking such a cautious approach,” says Emily Paradis, a spokeswoman for Build a Better Bloor-Dufferin (BBBD), which participated in an October mediation session with TLC and the developers following an extended series of meetings with planning officials.
Habitat for Humanity, the Cooperative Housing Federation of Toronto and St. Clare’s MultiFaith Housing Society, which has built five mixed-income housing projects in downtown Toronto over the past 20 years, are working with the residents who started BBBD. The organizations say they could leverage Section 37 grants, city grants and contributions from the federal government’s National Housing Strategy to raise the funds required to add several hundred mixed-income apartments on the property.
“This is a piece of public land across from Dufferin station, in a mixed-income community in the middle of a housing crisis,” said St. Clare’s executive director Andrea Adams. “Why is TLC, which is also a public institution, not participating in solving the problem?” Capital Developments’ managing partner Todd Cowan said in an e-mail that his firm was “pleased” to be invited to participate in the mediation but declined to comment on the negotiations, citing confidentiality.
“We are continuing to work with the community and affordable housing operators and are working towards a positive outcome.”
In a statement, TLC spokesman Rob Thompson pointed out that the organization’s board earlier this year updated its schools land policy so surplus properties will be repurposed for community uses, including affordable housing and recreation hubs. The deal with Metropia, however, predates the shift in policy.
“The pressures currently being experienced at this point of the project are typical of large and complex redevelopment initiatives of public lands involving multiple interest groups,” he said. “TLC is confident that an agreement can be reached to ensure that the end result is a project that meets the needs of all parties involved.”
Unlike the Queen/Coxwell site, deputy mayor Ana Bailao, who is Toronto’s housing czar as well as the local councillor, said the city has little ability to influence the mix at the Bloor-Dufferin site because the land belongs to TLC. “I don’t have the same tools,” she noted, adding that the Metropia proposal still has to pass muster with city council.
Ms. Paradis of BBBD and Ms. Adams, whose organization continues to develop mixed-income housing projects in desirable areas such as Queen West, hope that council and the mayor will press for a more diverse range of housing types on the site and look for creative solutions. “It will take some problem solving,” she said, adding, “Once the land is gone, it’s gone. This is a oncein-a-lifetime opportunity.”

Growing pains in the Fraser Valley: Home buyers seeking affordability are driving a development boom in one of the fastest-growing suburbs in Canada, but some residents are concerned about the township’s ability to handle the influx

Full text: Thirty years ago, a big chunk of undeveloped land in Langley, B.C. would have meant one thing to Kent Sillars: hectares of single-family homes.
That’s what people wanted when they moved to this oncerural Fraser Valley community, about an hour’s drive east of Vancouver. And it was what his company, Vesta Properties, started by building.
This year, Mr. Sillars’s company is finishing the construction of a very different kind of project on the 30 hectares of land it owns next to 200th Street in Langley’s Willoughby neighbourhood.
There will be only 73 stand -alone houses among the 2,000 homes in the development, which is being renamed Latimer Heights. The other 1,927 units will be townhouses, duplexes, rowhouses and condos. There will also be some office space mixed in and a “main street” filled with, Mr. Sillars says, European-style shops that will complement what he calls a Parisian style of building.
“Single-family is no longer the staple of housing for the Fraser Valley,” Vesta’s president says.
“The townhouse is the new single-family.”
But it’s not just the form of housing that’s different. It’s the style of the neighbourhood, which Mr. Sillars repeatedly calls an urban village: a place where those living in the condos and townhouses can go to a butcher or a dentist within walking distance or hike along trails around the manufactured pond instead of having to get into a car for absolutely everything.
It’s a style that is has been increasingly popular since the early 1980s, ever since a new wave of community planning, called the New Urbanism, favoured the idea of recreating small-town-style neighbourhoods in built-fromnothing subdivisions.
Cities such as Vancouver have created new developments, including Olympic Village, along those lines, and one decade-old project in central Surrey was officially labelled an urban village.
The region’s two main universities have also tried to create a small-town, main-street feel in the massive developments they’ve allowed on their land.
Latimer Heights will be the biggest and most rurally located of anything in that genre in the Lower Mainland.
It’s also part of a general trend in region that has seen builders move more and more to multifamily rather than single-family developments.
In the 15 years between the 2001 and 2016 censuses, there were only 800 new stand-alone houses added to the township of Langley, but almost 10,000 “ground-oriented” other types of housing and more than 2,000 apartments.
For younger people looking for affordable homes in an increasingly costly region, the new style is welcomed.
Tom and Kerrin Baxter, 29 and 30 respectively, will be moving this January from Kerrin’s parents’ basement in Walnut Grove to one of the corner, three-bedroom townhouses in the development at the relatively modest price (for the Lower Mainland) of $630,000 – half what a single-family house would cost there.
For Mr. Baxter, who grew up in a real, not manufactured, village in England’s West Sussex, the concept of Latimer Heights was appealing. And it was the right price.
“We don’t want to be house poor. We love to travel. This was just more sensible,” said Mr. Baxter, a registered massage therapist and personal trainer working in the next-door suburb of Surrey.
But he also worries about the rapid pace of development, bringing traffic congestion and massive transformations of the landscape, that he sees all around him, even though he is inevitably part of it.
“Even in the eight years I’ve been here, there’s been incredible change,” he said.
That’s something that many residents, both old and new, are worrying about in Langley.
The township, a large municipality that is separate from the smaller and historic city of Langley it surrounds, is one of the fastest-growing suburbs in Canada With a 12.6-per-cent increase between 2011 and 2016, when its population reached 117,000, it grew as quickly as Calgary, the country’s fastest-growing large metro.
It expanded even more than suburban Surrey, often seen as the growth capital of southern B.C.
A decade ago, the big growth area in Langley was Walnut Grove, north of the Trans-Canada Highway that cuts through the township. Now it’s Willoughby, south of the freeway, where only 40 per cent of the land planned for development has been built, including Latimer Heights, with another 60 per cent still to come.
And an area called Brookswood, a more typical single-family area even further south, is due for rezoning soon.
The construction boom is unlikely to abate, given that house prices in central Vancouver have only receded a little and that Langley is supposed to be getting a SkyTrain rapid-transit line at some point in the next decade, connecting it to the rest of the region in a way that the current bus system doesn’t.
But that explosive growth has brought a lot of unhappiness, as the township grapples with a rapidly changing mix of people, adding many younger households to an existing mix of real farmers (75 per cent of the township’s land is in B.C.’s famous Agricultural Land Reserve), horsey types and retirees wanting a rural spread, along with traditional families and kids in subdivisions.
The civic election last October saw several councillors elected with a decided not-so-fast attitude to development and a few who came close, such as Michelle Connerty.
“I go to every council meeting and see 753 trees coming down and none of them saved. [The Willoughby area] doesn’t have sidewalks or complete roads and a brand-new school there already has 10 portables on it,” said Ms. Connerty, who has lived with her husband and three children in Brookswood for about eight years.
She says Latimer Heights is one of the better-planned developments – “people I talk to who really know real estate think it’s a great idea” – but that doesn’t make up for the fact that the township is drowning in its own growth.
One new councillor who swept in with the second-highest number of votes, Eric Woodward, campaigned specifically on trying to come up with a more coherent approach.
“We allow development on any property in Willoughby, with no co-ordination or phasing, no infrastructure.” Both he and Ms. Connerty say the township is not asking developers for enough in contributions to help pay for needed community services, including roads and parks. They also say development needs to be slowed down until schools are built.
A sign of how divisive the rapid pace of development has become is that several councillors and the mayor were criticized this week when it was made public that they accepted personal contributions from several prominent developers (including relatively small amounts from Vesta) who have had projects approved in the township the past four years.
One former mayor, Rick Green, said he believes everything the council voted on should be reversed and new votes held where council members recuse themselves if necessary.
But Mayor Jack Froese says the criticisms are ill-informed.
“I find it kind of preposterous that they think $1,000 influences my decision.” (A legal opinion he said he had just received on Monday specified that a donation is a violation of the law if a council candidate makes a specific promise to a contributor for something in return.)
Mr. Froese said he is unabashedly pro-development, for a good reason.
People are moving to Langley in droves and they need housing as fast as it can be built.
He acknowledged that, when development goes at the pace it does in Langley, there are problems. The roads, schools and parks don’t keep up at first.
But, he said, if the township financed those up front, that would be hard on local taxpayers.
So, the township waits for developers to provide their contributions as projects roll out.
Langley township ran into some trouble in the last recession, edging toward bankruptcy, when it financed a lot of the infrastructure for the then-developing area of Walnut Grove and had to carry it for much longer than anticipated because of the housing crash.
So the mayor continues to say the way development is proceeding in the township is happening the most fiscally prudent way, even if it means short-term discomfort.
“There’s always the growing pains. But the developments like Vesta are important to house the people we know are coming. If you slow development down, all we do is increase the price of housing.”

Full text: The high-altitude Toronto condo market appears to be losing some thrust.
“I definitely am seeing some momentum taken out of the market,” says Christopher Bibby, a real estate agent with ReMax Hallmark Bibby Group Realty Ltd.
Mr. Bibby works mainly in the segment for hard lofts and luxury units in downtown Toronto.
In most cases, the purchasers are buying their next home.
Those people are taking their time.
Mr. Bibby says the hordes of potential buyers still exist; he senses they are increasingly cautious about inking a deal.
“I’ve worked in markets like that – where people just aren’t coming,” he says.
But in the fall of 2019, his office is booking record numbers of appointments to visit properties for sale.
There’s a high volume of people shopping; what the purchasers lack is a sense of urgency, he says: “I’m seeing ‘days on market’ increasing in certain buildings.”
This week, the Toronto Real Estate Board reported that condo sales in the Greater Toronto Area rose 5.1 per cent in October compared with October, 2018. The average price of a condo unit increased 9.6 per cent last month compared with the same month last year.
Sales of detached houses in the GTA, meanwhile, jumped 19.6 per cent last month while the average price of a detached house gained 3 per cent.
Mr. Bibby says some buyers are seeing better value in single-family dwellings and questioning the record prices that some condo units are fetching. In some cases, people are looking to downsize from a four-bedroom house into a two-bedroom condo – and the condo is the more expensive property.
“I think there’s more value in the homes that we see – and I’m a condo guy.”
Unit owners looking to sell, meanwhile, have become used to high-octane growth and feel deflated if they don’t set a new milestone for the building.
“Nobody wants to sell for less than the last sale,” he says.
Mr. Bibby recently sold a unit with an asking price slightly below $1.1-million. The unit is in a coveted building where the sellers expected to have a deal signed in a week. The sale took three weeks and the unit sold under asking.
While Mr. Bibby understands the frustration of sellers who always want to move the peg higher, he points out that, ultimately, consumers decide on the fair value for a property.
He adds that many owners have done extremely well – in some cases tripling their investment.
He also says the more balanced market works in favour of buyers.
He worked with one downsizing couple recently who were interested in a two-bedroom unit near Yonge Street and St. Clair Avenue with an asking price of $1.5-million.
The sellers trimmed the asking price when the unit didn’t sell after a few weeks.
Mr. Bibby advised his clients that they were in a strong position to negotiate, considering that the unit had been on the market for 40 days and the sellers had just reduced the list price.
The buyers were able to strike an agreement at $75,000 less than the owners were originally asking.
“We still negotiated on the reduction,” he says. “That was the reality of the market. We were the only buyers at the table.”
At a less rarified level, investors, speculators and first-time buyers can’t get their hands on properties quickly enough.
Below about $1.1-million, Mr. Bibby is seeing a surge in interest from investors. Many are local residents who are planning for retirement by shifting money out of the financial markets and putting it into an income property, he says. Some are buying onebedroom condo units while others are opting for single-family homes.
The appetite for preconstruction condo units is also phenomenal, he says. “The demand is higher than I’ve ever seen it.”
Manu Singh of Right at Home Realty Inc. says demand for condo units in the core remains extremely high, in the $600,000 to $1-million range.
Mr. Singh recently sold a twobedroom, two-bathroom condo unit at 209 Fort York Blvd. in a five-way contest.
Unit 971 is a corner unit with updated decor and a southeastfacing view toward Lake Ontario.
Mr. Singh set an asking price of $799,000 and held off offers for seven days.
One “bully” tried to pre-empt the bidding process with an offer on the second day. The sellers spurned that offer but a couple of days later another agent called with a client who also wanted to bully.
“That means there’s significant demand for this type of unit,” Mr. Singh told the owners, who decided to wait for the planned offer night.
The strategy paid off because they received another four bids and accepted an offer of $900,000.
Mr. Singh says two-bedroom units in that price range are very desirable to people who want to live in the building.
The final price, which equals about $858 a square foot, compares very favourably with downtown preconstruction units which sell for $1,200 to $1,400 a square foot – and sometimes more.
Because of that gap in prices between the resale market and the preconstruction market, Mr. Singh is recommending that his clients look at existing units.
He says buying a property where the purchaser can analyze comparable recent sales and determine how much rent units are fetching is less risky.
“From a purchasing standpoint and a leasing standpoint, you have the numbers right in front of you.”
He likens speculation on preconstruction to gambling because there are so many factors at play.
“Most sophisticated buyers would say, ‘I’m buying into the future – there’s uncertainty – I should be rewarded with a discount.’ ” Looking ahead, Mr. Singh doesn’t see condo prices coming down in the winter months for entry-level and mid-range units.
“My clients are asking me, ‘Is there going to be a discount in December or January?’ I’m just not seeing it,” Mr. Singh says.
The higher end offers more room for negotiation, he says.
Mr. Singh says many of his clients who own income properties in the $600,000 to $999,000 range are reluctant to list them for sale because they don’t want to leave any money on the table by selling too soon.
“The investors are hesitant because they’re trying to figure out where the top of the curve is.”
Mr. Bibby says that for now condo prices remain in the stratosphere. He thinks continuing single-digit sales and price growth is a more likely scenario than the blistering double-digit returns of years past.
“I think the question we all ask ourselves is, ‘Will this continue?’ ”

BRINGING BACK YESTERYEAR: RESTORER DREW SKUCE HAD TO RECREATE ELEMENTS OF A 1905 THEATRE FROM SCRATCH BASED ON SILICONE MOULDS AND ARCHIVAL PHOTOS

Full text: PARIS, ONT.
I t’s the one thing heritage restoration expert Drew Skuce, 38, did the math on. Each of the 100 ceiling tiles took two hours to manufacture: “Casting, popping, trimming [and] installation,” he lists. “That’s not painting, that’s not caulking, that’s not doing all the wiring first,” he continues with a laugh.
So how much time did Mr. Skuce spend on the rest of the building?
“Part of me is terrified to even think of it,” he says.
Suffice it to say that, in the two years he put his own restoration business, Paradigm Shift Customs, on hold to tackle the family-owned building at 51 Grand River St. N. in Paris, Ont., his social life was non-existent. An entire year was focused on restoring the old tin ceiling alone, entombed, as it was, above a 1980s drop ceiling with a mess of ductwork and random wiring inside.
It all started, he says, when the tenants moved out. Should his father’s successful bookstore next door, Green Heron Books, move in? No. 51 was more than double the size, so Roy Skuce would have that much more inventory to manage. And would it be as cozy?
Eventually, it was decided that Skuce-the-younger would take on its management.
Deciding to bring it back to 1918, however, was decided by the weather.
A bad winter had caused ice damming to “zipper off” the 1980s aluminum siding off the building’s rear façade, as well as damaging enough of the drop ceiling to warrant full removal.
Mr. Skuce knew about the old tin ceiling, of course, but it was after he “got a lawn chair from my parent’s place and reclined back as far as possible and stared at the ceiling for the entire night” that his fate was sealed: “I started seeing the ghosts of what the building used to be,” he says, noting that the building had been constructed around 1905 as “The Gem” movie theatre but spent most of its life as an A&P supermarket, which took over the space in 1918.
“I realized that the only time I would have to be able to bring this place back is right then; I couldn’t move tenants in and then work over top of them, that would be utterly insane.”
So, a different kind of insanity began: How to replace those 100 missing tin ceiling tiles? Well, before he could even begin, he and a buddy had to reroute the plumbing and bits of the heating, ventilation and air-conditioning system that was in the way, “and there were two furnaces in the basement, too, and the pipes were all crossed over so when one apartment upstairs would turn on their thermostat, the bookstore would start getting cold,” Mr. Skuce laments. He looked into having new tin stamped by Brian Greers in Petersburg, Ont., but, because nine different patterns made up the “extinct” composition, and each new die would cost $1,000 to cast, he put on his thinking cap instead.
Using his former training in theatre special effects, he created standard silicone moulds of “the very best tiles that I could find,” he explains. “I straightened them all out, took them on the anvil, whacked all shapes back, so everything was just nice and clean.” Then, at the Sculpture Supply Canada store in Toronto, he found “Aqua-Resin” – a non-toxic, fire-rated gypsum/fibreglass hybrid – that would allow him to manufacture his own lightweight yet superdetailed reproductions that “once they were painted out, you could not tell the difference.”
Of course, the missing 15 feet at the front posed an altogether different challenge. Not a duplicate of the rear of the store, these had framed the 1918 V-shaped entrance to the A&P. And since all that was left were nail holes, Mr. Skuce spent a lot of time on a ladder marking these with chalk: “And then I lay down on my back on the ground and did a fun game of connect the dots.”
Interestingly, his choice as to “when” to restore the building to is at exactly the period when the movie theatre left and the A&P moved in because that’s what he has “the most of.”
“Follow the information and try not to hypothesize, because assumption will kill you. The moment you run out of evidence is where you stop. I think that goes for archaeology, too,” he laughs.
Speaking of evidence, it was through vintage photographs – some from the local historical society but many resulting from a Facebook call – that Mr. Skuce was able to recreate the original cornices, corbels and other bits and bobs that make up the original marquee (which now resides on the back of the building; he’s doing another for the front). Many were parade shots in which only a little of the storefront was caught in the background: “If it’s got five pixels of the building, I will take it,” he laughs.
By taking real-life measurements of the buildings on either side, he could then put the photos into a computer program, zoom in and figure out fairly accurate measurements for his millwork drawings: “When you start getting even numbers … you know you’re heading in the right direction,” he explains, adding that pre-Second World War boards were offered in standard sizes. “Why would [a carpenter] make more cuts to make life hell? … It’s stuff my grandfather taught me.”
As for the months of hell it took to bring the floors back, he blames his mother. She’d spied the original three-quarter-inch maple flooring under the “sedimentary layers going back a hundred years” – including A&P’s distinctive red-and-white checkerboard – so, knowing she’d want it revealed, he modified a twin blade saw to penetrate down to within a cat’s whisker of it. With hundreds of perforations over the 1,500 square feet, Mr. Skuce could then rip up manageable squares with a pry bar.
“That sucked,” he laughs.
What doesn’t suck is what the Gem Marketplace looks like today. Home to independent startups selling everything from handmade crafts and ecofriendly items to soap, candles and jewellery, all lit by vintage lighting (but that’s another story) – the building is now open to a whole new clientele that will appreciate its heritage charms. But, this author wonders, do they look up at the ceiling?
“They do,” vendor Elaine Kellam of KBC Designs says. “We have a lot of people that will just come in and stare and [say] ‘Wow.’ ” ”I didn’t even know that,” Mr. Skuce says, the hint of a smile forming on his tired face.

The Squamish Nation aims to build a better city in Vancouver

Full text: What if it was easier to build a better city? With a lot of downtown housing in energy-efficient buildings; with lots of green space and almost no room at all for cars?
That’s the vision that’s come forward this week from the Squamish Nation in Vancouver.
Senakw is a project on reserve land and lies almost entirely outside the lines of city regulation.
Despite that fact – or because of it – it promises to be an exemplary piece of urban development.
The Squamish Nation has strong ambitions here. Working in partnership with Vancouverbased developers Westbank, it aims for a high level of environmental sustainability. “The project speaks loudly to our identity as the original owners of these lands,” Squamish Nation councillor Khelsilem, who uses one name, said this week.
It revealed this week that it intends to develop an 11-acre reserve in Vancouver with 11 towers totalling 6,000 homes, plus a substantial amount of retail space and generous green space.
All this would fill an L-shaped piece of land that was returned to the nation about 15 years ago, a remnant of its ancestral lands on the shore of False Creek – and most recently used by CP Rail.
Khelsilem said the project will have a strong Indigenous identity. “Other developers aren’t operating from a rich cultural heritage, as we are,” Khelsilem told me. And that’s clear from the first drawings of the project. The curvaceous buildings by local firm Revery Architecture incorporate a lot of greenery and traditional Squamish symbolism.
Indigenous design will extend through the project on a variety of scales, Khelsilem said, from public art and landscape architecture all the way down to custom doorknobs on suite entry doors. “There will be dozens of Squamish artists involved, at all stages of the process.”
Landscape architecture will be by Vancouver’s PFS Studio and Toronto’s Public Work. The skinny, irregular site will link up with adjacent Vanier Park and activate the space under the Burrard Bridge. It’s a remarkable expression of design creativity, turning an easily overlooked site into a meaningful place.
The project also scrambles the debate within Vancouver about real estate development. Being supportive of reconciliation, in this case, means saying nice things about a bunch of tall buildings. A number of Vancouver progressives who are skeptical of development have done so this week. And Mayor Kennedy Stewart has publicly expressed his support for the proposal – but that’s no surprise; he has repeatedly expressed the view that a city with a housing shortage will benefit from all sorts of housing.
That is, bizarrely, a controversial position. There is a faction of Vancouverites, many of whom live in multimillion-dollar houses, who have a visceral dislike of All Those Towers. Councillor Colleen Hardwick told The Globe and Mail’s Frances Bula that the project would be “inconsistent with the values of a livable city.” This has something to do with height; anti-development figures such as Ms. Hardwick often equate “livable” with short buildings that house fewer (and richer) people.
The Squamish Nation sees it differently. As Khelsilem explained to me, the nation has declared a climate emergency. “And we’re not going to fight climate change using cars,” he said.
“We’re going to address it using transit, cycling and walking.” So the development will have only about 600 parking spots for its 6,000 homes. The nation is advocating for a light-rail line to the site. “People who live here will have to accept that they won’t be using a car,” Khelsilem said.
This is a critical point, translating broad ideas about “climate action” into real action. But most real estate developers wouldn’t take that leap – or, if they wanted to, they wouldn’t be allowed.
Most cities, including Vancouver, mandate much higher levels of car parking within new developments, refusing to accept that new residents might be willing to go car-free.
This decision also saves vast amounts of money. An underground parking space on this site, Khelsilem said, would cost between $80,000 and $120,000 to build. Now those funds can go to better use, either to the nation itself or to other features of the development. And those thousands of parking spots, in concrete garages, would carry a massive carbon footprint of their own.
The Squamish, by avoiding this, will aim for the project to be net zero – generating no net carbon emissions at all. To achieve this, the Westbank subsidiary Creative Energy is going to build a neighbourhood energy system on the site, linked under Burrard Bridge to the existing grid downtown.
But leave the specifics aside.
Take this project as a thought experiment: What if we accept that densifying an inner city – even with towers – is the greenest way we can build? And that leftover corners of a city might have deep significance and become rich ground for building a better future? It starts here.

Full text: Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce is in negotiations to sell its Caribbean business to a Colombian billionaire, hoping to close the books on a difficult sale process that has taken two years.
Since failing to take Barbadosbased CIBC FirstCaribbean International Bank public in 2018, CIBC has held talks with strategic and financial buyers and is now eyeing a deal with Jaime Gilinski Bacal, according to a source familiar with the discussions. The source is not being identified by The Globe and Mail because they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter.
Born in Colombia and educated in the United States, Mr. Gilinski lives in London and is best known for his investments in banking and real estate. In the late 1990s, he and a group of investors bought Banco de Colombia from the government and made a large investment in Banco de Sabadell, Spain’s fourthlargest banking group.
CIBC originally tried to take FirstCaribbean public at a valuation of US$1.4-billion last year, but the new sale price could come in around the unit’s US$1.2billion book value. Banks tend to sell for between one and two times their book values.
It is also possible that Mr. Gilinski could buy a 70-per-cent to 75-per-cent stake, according to the source, which would decrease CIBC’s proceeds from the sale.
CIBC declined to comment on any sale discussions. “Our focus is on enhancing FirstCaribbean’s long-term growth prospects while creating value for the clients, shareholders and other stakeholders of both FirstCaribbean and CIBC,” the bank said in an e-mailed statement.
Mr. Gilinski could not be reached for comment.
Any sale would solve a major headache for CIBC. Five years ago, with the Caribbean economy struggling, more than half of CIBC’s total gross impaired loans came from FirstCarribbean.
CIBC also took a $420-million writedown on the division that year.
For the next three years, CIBC focused on cleaning up First Caribbean’s balance sheet, largely by cutting costs, and by the end of 2017 it was looking to conduct an IPO of the unit on a U.S. exchange. Such a deal would have allowed the Canadian parent – which owns 92 per cent of FirstCaribbean – to start cashing out.
However, the offering was withdrawn in June, 2018, because it failed to garner enough investor support. One month later, the Barbados government missed an interest payment on external debt, putting CIBC at risk because it had US$506-million worth of exposure to Barbados through securities and loans.
Yet, a deal with Mr. Gilinski isn’t guaranteed to succeed because CIBC may face opposition from local governments sensitive to potential job cuts under a new owner.
Earlier this year, Scotiabank ran into trouble while attempting to sell its operations in nine Caribbean countries to Republic Financial Holdings Ltd., the Trinidad and Tobago-based parent company of Republic Bank, when deals to sell its assets in Antigua and Barbuda and Guyana faced resistance from local authorities.
“To date, [CIBC FirstCaribbean] has not consulted, advised or in any other way communicated with the government of Antigua and Barbuda concerning this matter,” said Sir Ronald Sanders, Antigua’s non-resident high commissioner to Canada. “One would have thought, after the experience of Bank of Nova Scotia’s attempts to sell its assets in the Caribbean without the knowledge of governments beforehand, that [CIBC FirstCaribbean] would not have made the same mistake.”

Full text: What luxury can look like amid Montreal’s real estate boom
REAL ESTATE REPORTER MONTREAL
7439 Henri-Julien Ave.
MONTREAL Asking Price: $1,895,000 Taxes: $6,709 (2019) Lot Size: 1,896 square feet Agents: Jeff Lee and Marie-Claude Bergeron, Engel & Vvlkers Montrial THE BACK STORY Walking down the streets of neighbourhoods such as Villeray, you’re treated to housing types unseen in much of the rest of the country. There are tall narrow buildings with exterior staircases that climb up to second-floor front doors, snugged up cheekby-jowl with no laneways to the rear. There’s a wide variety of brick types and colours, although it’s not overflowing with sentimentality or ornamentation.
Some houses look purpose-built for multifamily rental, some look like they were converted to apartments, others are clearly just for one family. It’s dense and urban without being a series of towers and mini-mansions. It’s the kind of “missing middle” that many Canadian communities are lacking.
In other words, it’s an interesting neighbourhood to find a listing for close to $2-million. It’s what luxury can look like in Montreal’s booming real estate market.
The first impression that 7439 Henri-Julien makes is that it blends in with its neighbours. It’s a former triplex built in 1924 that was converted into a single-family house in 2017. Inside, there’s a sense that this is a showroom, a tastefully restrained space that you can project your own personality on. That’s usually the goal for realtors staging a house, but this house has permanent design choices that help create that impression. That’s probably not too surprising considering the current owner designed it, and her family construction company built it.
Marie-Pier Guilmain, a product designer and art director with her own design partnership (MPGMD) builds the model homes for her family construction company, specializing in townhouses and custom-homes outside Montreal.
“The house is a complete design of my own: I worked on the layout of the interior, I designed all the cabinets, selected all the finishes and I have also design[ed] the backyard layout as well as the shed and the gate,” Ms. Guilmain said. ”I always take things from previous projects to improve the functionality and the material choices of the next one.”
THE HOUSE TODAY The house has clean, open and
contemporary spaces with mainly white walls so colour and drama find their way in through furnishings, use of space, decorative pieces (some of which are original creations, but, sorry, are going with Ms. Guilmain) and unique fixtures. Wood appears everywhere, but the same grain, stain or finish rarely appears
twice. There’s a lot of light and angular metal, too, everything from bespoke steel stair railings to steel-framed windows to lighting fixtures with chains and hoops. The powder room sink on the main floor has a black faucet set into a wall - it almost looks like a shower fixture installed at torso level into the white subway
tile back splash with black grout.
The sum of these parts is a quietly confident space that commands respect.
Ms. Guilmain built this as her family home, and expected to live here for 25 years. Plans change, and while she is selling, she intends to stay in the area.
She expects buyers might look a little like her.
“I certainly imagine a family that likes the vibe of a typical Montreal neighbourhood, but also really want to have a full house to themselves,” she said.
“People that love to have friends and family over for barbecue, that love to cook for them and appreciate to pick up all the ingredient[s] at the local market and meet the farmers. With seven bedrooms, you can also have family to visit from outside the city and stay for a night or two!” Through the front door is an extra-wide hallway with hidden oversized closets, perfect for navigating strollers and bikes, according to listing agent Jeff Lee.
To the left is the main-floor powder room, then a short hallway opens out into the wideopen main living (on the right) and kitchen space (on the left) that ends with a wall of windows that slides open to offer indooroutdoor space when the season allows.
The floor is all hardwood, with light grey cabinets and white subway tile back splash wall in the kitchen. A huge island with seating for four separates the living area from the food-prep zone. And in the rear corner is a mudroom area that is sectioned off with a slatted wood half-wall.
“The backdoor mud room bench is one of the sections that I am the most proud of,” Ms. Guilmain said. ”I wanted this to be very functional; I didn’t want to see the usual back entry mess but also didn’t want it to close
the open space. So when you’re in the living room, you only see a half-wall with architecture element and when you are in the entry, there is a hidden shelf for storage as well as a bench to sit and put your boots on.“The outdoor space is open, like a courtyard; the brick back here has been redone and is fresh and modern with black-framed windows. There’s a massive, solid steel and wood sliding gate/fence that opens for the parking pad in the yard, or for playing in the alley (as local children do).
This level is the nerve centre of the house, and even an open “homework space” at the top of the second-floor stairs is connected to this family hub, just a raised voice away.
“When you have kids, you understand that every task has to be effective. So every movement has to be calculated to save time and effort,” Ms. Guilmain said.
“The playroom is close to the kitchen so I can have an eye on my kids while preparing dinner, same thing with the backyard, it’s only two wide steps to get to the grass and with the wide glass patio door, I can see them play outside while in the kitchen.” Upstairs are four bedrooms, large and bright, some have playful paint finishes, some are more serene.
The upstairs bathroom has white tiles with the same dark grout as other wet spaces in the house, but here they are square instead of rectangles, a throwback style for sure. Cool, grey oversized tiles rise up from the floor to make a vertical cladding for the lower part of the shower tub. The walk-in shower in the basement has a similar tile, but with more black in the cabinetry and fixtures.
The laundry room is on the second floor, a feature that every new house should have (why did
we ever schlep heavy baskets up and down stairs to and from basements?).
The basement has radiant floor heating, a big media-room den and two more bedrooms for visitors. It doesn’t look like a lot of house from outside, but in reality it’s more than 3,330 square feet of living space in a fast-gentrifying area.
THE NEIGHBOURHOOD “Villeray is in high demand right now for the young families who desire to remain close to the centre of the action to raise their family,” Mr. Lee said. ”This property is also located very close to the division line between Villeray and Rosemont. What the Plateau was in the nineties then moved up towards Mile End, then Rosemont and now it’s Villeray that gets lots of the traction and demand. Don’t get me wrong, Plateau and Rosemont are still super cool, but not that affordable for a family any more.
Like, let’s say, Trinity Bellwoods in Toronto or Kitsilano in Vancouver.“The house is very close to Rue Castelnau, the main commercial strip, and about a kilometre from the Rue Jean-Talon, home to the huge farmers’ market of the same name. Mr. Lee said it is close to tech, startups, cinema and advertising offices as well as good francophone public schools. ”Jean-Talon Market is obviously a must and we go there almost every day to pick up some fresh vegetables and local produce,” Ms. Guilmain said.
“One of our favourites is the bakery Le pain dans les voiles; you go in there to buy just a coffee and you get out with $20 of heavenly made breads and treats.” And Ms. Guilmain’s house offers something the area is increasingly searching for: the luxury updates are already added to a once-affordable neighbourhood.
“The inventory for these types of family homes is unfortunately very low. That’s why you will see
high prices for these properties,“Mr. Lee said. ”Small developers are trying to get their hands on beaten-down duplex and triplex [properties] to convert them in these types of family cottages, but of course, the city and the regulators are very protective of the rental units and general affordability of the area. We of course, are all very appreciative of that tight regulation in place in these family neighbourhoods that we also happen to personally inhabit. Otherwise the panorama would be very divided and not pleasant.” Montreal’s mix of low-rise density and neighbourhood amenities was once one of the best-kept secrets in the country, but the city is now into its fourth year of real estate price rises according to an Engel & Voelkers report from earlier this year.
“The market is seeing investors from Toronto moving to Montreal, along with Ottawa, to invest in new builds and properties. This growth is expected to continue.”

Full text: Asking price: $2.8-million Selling price: $2,775,000 Previous selling prices: $2,395,000 (2015); $1,630,000 (2014); $1,410,000 (2011) Taxes: $13,149 (2019) Days on the market: Three Listing and co-op agents: Belinda Lelli and Paul MacMillan, Royal LePage Real Estate Services Ltd.
THE ACTION Available listings are generally rare around this corner of Lawrence Park near the Rosedale Golf Club and top rated schools, but this four-bedroom home had several competitors when listed at $2,998,000 for nearly a month early this summer.
To target local families before they vacationed out of town, open houses were hosted in the last weekend in June. To add further enticement, it was relisted at a reduced price of $2.8-million on June 27 – and sold three days later.
“Buyers for homes in this price range have had to cope with the new stress test requirements. As a result, the market for these properties has softened,” said agent Belinda Lelli, who ultimately found multiple offers.
“A new aggressive price reduction prior to Canada Day long weekend made for a quick sale 99 per cent of our asking price on the holiday Sunday.”
WHAT THEY GOT This centre hall residence shows the craftmanship of a bygone era with its brick façade, rich wainscotting in the foyer and dining area, and fireplaces in the living room and one bedroom upstairs.
The roof, windows and mechanical systems have all been updated and there are heated floors in five bathrooms. The remodelled kitchen has a long island with bar seating. The basement was also redone to create a recreation space and guest rooms.
A double garage, south-facing deck and fenced-in yard are clustered at the back of the 50-footby-125-foot grounds.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “This home is a classic 1927 house with 21st-Century updates,” Ms. Lelli said.
“This coveted street in Lawrence Park north offers a tranquil setting that is mere steps from all the conveniences of Yonge Street.”

Full text: The Tsleil-Waututh Nation is asking the federal government to approve its request to expand its reserve land to include a sprawling area in the District of North Vancouver in hopes of building a new residential and commercial neighbourhood.
Tsleil-Waututh leaders, who are opposed to the Trans Mountain oil pipeline expansion project, say developing real estate will be crucial to ensuring the economic self-sufficiency of their 600 members.
“The return of this ancestral land to the Tsleil-Waututh Nation will help the Nation move toward economic prosperity for present and future generations,” the elected First Nation council said.
The Tsleil-Waututh and Darwin Properties co-own 45 acres of land east of the Ironworkers Memorial Bridge, near the First Nation’s reserve. The private property along the Dollarton Highway includes the site of a former gravel pit and is now mostly undeveloped, though a child-care centre and two industrial firms are among the tenants situated in a forested area.
In May, the District of North Vancouver council deferred making a decision on an application by the Tsleil-Waututh and Darwin to build what they call the North Shore Innovation District. Nearby residents opposed to the project say that even after Darwin scaled back designs, the development plans still have too much density, don’t fit with the existing neighbourhood and would extend traffic jams in the congested Maplewood area.
Under new legislation that came into force in August, the federal government is now allowing Indigenous groups to request permission to expand geographically, known as an “addition to reserve” application. The TsleilWaututh, which has offices on what Ottawa calls Burrard Inlet Indian Reserve No. 3 in North Vancouver, filed documents for broadening its land reserve in September through Crown-Indigenous Relations and Northern Affairs Canada.
Tsleil-Waututh leaders say they will hold community consultations and conduct environmental studies next year, aiming to gain approval from Ottawa in the spring of 2021 to add the Maplewood acreage to the Indigenous group’s land code. The holding consists of one parcel at 39 acres and the other at six acres.
“The decision to file an addition to reserve relates back to Tsleil-Waututh Nation’s mandate to expand the community’s land base, as well as to develop new and existing business opportunities and partnerships that provide economic growth for the Tsleil-Waututh community,” the band council said.
Tsleil-Waututh elected Chief Leah George-Wilson said in a videotaped message that her community, also known as TWN, values the history of its ancestral villages.
“The return of this ancestral land will not only help to reconcile the past for TWN, but allow the Nation to thrive in the future through increasing our small land base,” she said. “More specifically, it will bring additional transportation options for our community, diverse housing types, employment opportunities and more support for local businesses and services.”
In an e-mail, Ms. George-Wilson noted that the Maplewood project is within the rezoning jurisdiction of the District of North Vancouver. But assuming the federal process for adding reserve land pans out in 2021, the development would be carried out with 99-year leaseholds under the direction of the Tsleil-Waututh.
“Our decision to file the addition to reserve is in support of self-determination for our community, addressing the unjust loss of land for the Tsleil-Waututh Nation and increasing our reserve land holdings for future generations,” she wrote.
The District of North Vancouver has cautioned that if the development proceeds, the Dollarton Highway would need to be upgraded, including new sidewalks and separated bike lanes.
In putting the proposal by the Tsleil-Waututh and Darwin on hold earlier this year, the district noted that work on North Vancouver’s official community plan is continuing and a final report won’t be ready until the fall of 2020. “We will be identifying current and emerging issues, challenges and constraints, trends within key topics, and areas where we can improve,” the district said.
Tsleil-Waututh leaders are optimistic that their goals will be in harmony with North Vancouver’s official community plan.

Lessons in human-scale urban design: How a 1970s-era mayor planted the seeds of a city renaissance

Full text: A round the same time activist/author Jane Jacobs was unpacking for her new life in Toronto, Max Heller (19192011) was setting up office as a new city councillor for Greenville, S.C. The year was 1968, and Ms. Jacobs, fresh from fighting expressways and “urban renewal” in New York, would do it all over again in the Big Smoke, where she’d influence another generation of urban thinkers; Mr.Heller, a former textile mill vicepresident who’d escaped the Holocaust, would become Greenville mayor in 1971 and plant seeds for a Jacobs-worthy renaissance that would become the envy of urbanists everywhere.
It’s too bad the two never met.
As a Torontonian, Greenville, today, is immediately familiar: After incorporating as a city in 1869, their first construction boom occurred soon after; this resulted in dozens and dozens of Victorian buildings with handsome archways and interesting (red) brickwork. It was around this time that the first cotton mills and warehouses – which also resemble Toronto’s industrial buildings – were built. The mills would become so numerous and prosperous – by the mid-20th century, Greenville was the textile capital of the world – downtown merchants would respond with large department stores, such as Ivey’s, and, by the 1920s, a luxury hotel (the Poinsett, named after Joel Roberts Poinsett, a U.S. congressman who brought the Flor de Nochebuena plant back from Mexico).
Walking Main Street today – as I did over Thanksgiving weekend – one notices other things, too: The Louis Sullivan-style, 10storey “skyscraper” from 1925 (the Chamber of Commerce Building) and the Beaux-Arts courthouse (now a bookstore) across the street; small, high-end shops in art deco and modern art styles; and perhaps most importantly, extra-wide sidewalks, public art aplenty and a lush, rocky park built around a waterfall, Falls Park on the Reedy, just down a staircase. It’s a walker’s paradise and all of those construction cranes – another “Toronto” sight – means walkers will enjoy it for generations to come.
But it wasn’t always this way.
When Mr. Heller took office, Main Street was a four-lane road, the big stores had decamped for the malls, the little stores were anything but quaint, shady characters dominated and the waterfall was pinned (and forgotten) underneath a concrete wrestler’s hold: a 1960 overpass called Camperdown Bridge. By the lateseventies, the mills began to shut down, which added to the blight.
So, when Mr. Heller and his team suggested a tree planting and sidewalk widening plan in the mid-1970s (as envisioned by West Coast urban planner Lawrence Halprin) many couldn’t see the logic. But when a new Main Street hotel followed in 1982, the Hyatt Regency, other dominoes began to fall, albeit slowly.
Zoning laws changed to allow mixed-use development; a handful of offices moved back; the Peace Center for the Performing Arts, which incorporated parts of the 1882 Huguenot Mill, opened in 1990; a major sports arena opened in 1998; the Poinsett Hotel, shuttered since 1987, was restored and returned to the public in 2000; and in 2006, a baseball stadium based on Boston’s Fenway Park opened in the historic West End.
Interestingly, the same consulting firm, Maryland-based Land Design/Research, was called in by three different Greenville administrations – during the late-1970s, late-1980s and late-1990s – to shape policy and influence growth. Which ultimately worked, as the last (and arguably most important) piece of the puzzle, residential development, fell into place in the 2000s, as townhouses and midrise condos such as RiverPlace were built.
But what about all of those mills? A 1913 Greenville News report stated that the “largest cotton mill under one roof in the United States” (Woodside Mill) was located in Greenville, where the “presidents of 41 mills live” and 11 cotton mills with a “capital of $10,000,000” employ 7,000 people. Most of these lived in the adjacent “mill towns” which each had the requisite Baptist and Methodist church, company store, and, in some cases, a barbershop and a community centre. Eventually, Greenville would boast 18 mills that formed a crescent shape around the city (the shape owing to the railroad).
Ninety years later, as the rest of Greenville flourished, these mills – which once produced millions of miles of gingham, military canvas, twill, and basic broadcloth and built the city in the process – remained forgotten.
“Ellison Adger Smyth decided to build his mill out of tan brick and black mortar instead of the traditional red brick and white mortar,” said historian Don Koonce as we pulled up to Dunean Mill during a driving tour of the remaining 13 mills. While part of Dunean sits empty, a company that manufactures airbags occupies some of the building.
We’ve just come from (Captain O.P.) Mills Mill, which began operation in 1897 and closed in 1978 (converted to condominiums in 2004). Interestingly, upon moving to Greenville in 1975, Mr. Koonce, surprised that there were no records of where the mills were located, did the research himself and produced his own map. “This was the ballpark,” he continued, filling me in about the importance of the Textile League. “You’ve heard the name Shoeless Joe Jackson? He played there.”
After having a look at Judson Mill, which will soon turn into rental apartments, and the Piedmont Plush Mill, which now houses Serendipity Labs Coworking, we arrive at Brandon Mill, built in 1899 and closed in 1977.
“This is one of my favourite mills, this is really cool,” Mr. Koonce said as we walked into the Art Center. “Artists have studios upstairs … and they do a lot of workshops with children; the developers have tried very hard to maintain the character of these buildings.” Converted to rental apartments in 2016, a quick check online reveals a 1,000-square-foot unit with a 16feet ceiling, the “Pablo Picasso,” is on offer for US$1,455 a month, and a 2,500-square-foot. “Jimmy Hendrix” suite for $3,190. “And it’s so incredible that this is happening, when, 10 years ago, they were all empty,” said Mr. Koonce, who spent nine years producing a documentary on the history of the mills for PBS.
We drive past others: Woodside Mill (1902), whose owners started Myrtle Beach (now being adapted into 307 apartments); Monaghan Mill (1900, converted to rental apartments in 2006); and Poe Mill (1896), where only two smokestacks remain, as well as the approximately 600 mill village homes.
As the mills themselves get reinvented, the “bar is coming up” in these surrounding mill villages, added Mr. Koonce, who worked on Jimmy Carter’s presidential campaign, as “people are buying houses, fixing up houses.”
In three years, he said, the Swamp Rabbit Trail – a 35-kilometre walking and bicycling trail that follows the path of an old railroad corridor – will connect to the mills, since some are more than five kms from the centre of town.
Once that happens, the most Jacobian downtown in the United States will have “eyes on the street” just about everywhere else, too.

IF YOU GO
Fourteen hours by car and 90 minutes (in the air) by plane, Greenville is a quick getaway for Toronto snowbirds.
Although Asheville, N.C., is only 100 kilometres away, Greenville doesn’t have the same neo-hippie, new age aspect … not a man-bun in sight.
Instead, expect Asheville’s liberalism buoyed by a clean, upscale city full of art-lovers and foodies. And while the foodie scene is somewhat new – every local I spoke with says it took off less than a decade ago – there are wine bars, new-twist Southern restaurants, steakhouses, French bistros and ethnic momand-pops up and down Main Street.
In addition to downtown’s Victorian and deco architecture, check out Greenville’s modernist city hall (1973) and the 25-storey Daniel Building (1964-66). Take John Nolan’s architecture tour (greenvillehistorytours.com) and he’ll reveal where the city’s only Frank Lloyd Wright home is located. To stay in the heart of the action, rooms at the Poinsett (now a Westin) start at US$185 a night; for a quieter time, the six-month-old Homewood Suites is a 10-minute walk away for a few dollars less. Not to be missed is the Fall for Greenville festival each October, where most of Main Street is closed for tastings and music performances; started in 1982, the festival now welcomes more than 250,000 visitors to celebrate.

Full text: THE LISTING
A real estate investor and cofounder of a “socially conscious” cannabis company who evicted tenants from four apartments in downtown Toronto in order to convert their homes into a proposed daycare and a gym says the process is “heartbreaking,” but also “the nature of the real estate business.”
The case puts a human face on a growing tension in the city between long-time tenants whose rent-controlled tenures have helped them avoid the rapid runup in rental rates and real estate investors keen to find ways to break these leases. Corporate owners of rental properties are increasingly turning to narrow loopholes in the provincial Residential Tenancy Act that turn renovations into a way to permanently remove tenants.
“As housing affordability gets worse in the city, people are getting squeezed,” said City Councillor Brad Bradford, who sits on the Subcommittee on the Protection of Affordable Rental Housing. He says these “renovictions” are a growing problem. “We all know someone, or know someone who knows someone, who’s been in this situation. I hear it almost every month at the planning and housing committee. I hear it from my councillor colleagues; landlord wants to renovate, landlord wants to move in, landlord wants to sell. It’s the reality of living in a growing, prosperous city.”
On Oct. 9, the Landlord and Tenant Board (LTB) ordered the last residential tenants of 860 College St. in the city’s west end to vacate the premises so that the building could be renovated. Ever since, Ivan Wadgymar has been waiting in the cold (the building managers turned his heat off – although they have provided space heaters) for a sheriff to come and remove his possessions. Mr. Wadgymar, a restaurateur who runs a bakery down the street, has lived in the building on and off for the past seven years as a roommate to his cousin Cecillia Jabbaz, who has lived there for at least a dozen years. He claims that he was not offered notice, compensation or alternative living arrangements by the property manager until late in the legal process.
“I feel like people need to know more about what their actual rights are,” Mr. Wadgymar said. “Me and my cousin were under a lot of assumptions that we as tenants could have more rights or more defence. But every single thing we have tried has been thrown out the door.”
“It’s a crappy situation,” said Basem Hanna, owner of Almega Asset & Property Management, which purchased the threestorey building through a shell company in 2017. Although he has never dealt personally with Mr. Wadgymar, Mr. Hanna said his company offered a cash-forkeys arrangement to buy all the tenants out rather than resort to a formal eviction. His position is that Mr. Wadgymar and Ms. Jabbaz were “disrespectful” in rejecting those early negotiations, and that forced his representatives hands in dealing with them.
“I own many properties across the city of Toronto. Oftentimes, when I’m taking away one or two spots, I’m also adding, you know, hundreds somewhere else,” Mr. Hanna said. Mr. Hanna is also cofounder of TREC Brands (TREC stands for Trust, Respect, Equality and Compassion), which markets retail cannabis products.
Operating under the corporate moniker, “Building Brands Through Social Good,” TREC claims to donate 10 per cent of its profits to progressive causes, in particular those that advance women’s equality and homelessness.
When asked how evicting lowincome tenants fits with his corporate values, Mr. Hanna said that “at a certain point, you have to say, uh, compassion has its limits, if it’s not being met on the other side,” he said. “There’s a certain point where, if you feel like you’re being treated inappropriately, you have to defend yourself as well.”
Mr. Wadgymar and his cousin are planning to move back in with their parents, saying they can’t find anything in the area close to the current rent on their three-bedroom apartment of $1,500 a month. Mr. Wadgymar said one neighbouring landlord offered him a two-bedroom apartment for $2,900 a month.
Research from real estate analysts Urbanation Inc. estimates that in the Greater Toronto Area, average rents have risen about 30 per cent in the past three years, and that among recently rented one-bedroom apartments, the average lease rate was topping $2,500. But prices have stayed relatively flat for the past two quarters, and are up just 6 per cent from the previous year, which Urbanation suggests could mean the city’s renters are close to hitting an affordability ceiling.
Mr. Hanna’s company had a strong legal hand in its eviction case because of the size of the building. Ontario’s Residential Tenancies Act allows for landlords to file an N13 “Notice to End your Tenancy Because the Landlord Wants to Demolish the Rental Unit, Repair it or Convert it to Another Use,” but if there are five or more apartments in a building, the regulations require the landlord to offer 120 days notice and three-months rent to evicted tenants. Because 860 College is only four units, the tenants were entitled to nothing.
“I don’t feel bad for making that decision … I do not feel bad, and I will not be made to feel bad, you know,” Mr. Hanna said.
“If the courts agree with me, why is this wrong?” In September, Almega also offered a cash-for-keys deal to tenants in a six-apartment building it owns at 1 Kingswood Ave. in Toronto’s Beaches neighbourhood. In a letter from Mark Melchers, partner with Cohen Highley, who also represented Almega in the 860 College case, the lawyer told tenants that the interior of the building would be demolished and the number of rental apartments reduced, and therefore they would not be offered the chance to return to their units after the renovation.
Alarmed tenants reached out to their local councillor, Mr. Bradford. “Unfortunately, this isn’t the first time I’ve been contacted about renoviction,” he said. After his office informed Almega they would be keeping an eye out for any permits filed in relation to the project, Almega’s staff sent a letter informing tenants it was abandoning the renovation plans.
Mr. Hanna cited the case as an example of Almega being respectful to tenants, although he acknowledged the number of units at Kingswood made the chances of obtaining a legal eviction more remote.
Toronto has bylaws to protect rental housing from being demolished. The city bars the granting of demolition and construction permits for any building with six or more apartments unless rental units are replaced. But there are gaps, too. Those rules do not cover buildings such as 860 College St., which sits inside the ward of deputy mayor Ana Bailao, who has decried renovictions in the past and is the city’s affordable-housing advocate. Ms. Bailao’s office was unable to provide comment at press time as to why the councillor approved the removal of affordable rental units in favour of a daycare.
Last week, Mr. Wadgymar heard that the LTB will not hear an appeal of his case, and on Monday, he was notified by the Ministry of the Attorney-General that a provincial sheriff will be coming on Oct. 28 to evict him.
After the order, he made a banner decrying the N13 process and hung it from his balcony facing College Street. He says he has received many expressions of support from his neighbours. While he is not hopeful about his own situation, he thinks there’s a case for expanding the RTA’s compensation rules to smaller rental buildings.
“I was shocked when I went to the hearing and saw how many people were going through this on a daily basis,” he said. “The fact that they [the landlords] don’t want to be human, or have a talk or negotiate … I’ve been very alone in all this and I’ve been angry.”

Toronto’s Sidewalk Labs courting Canadian VCs: Alphabet subsidiary has been on a charm offensive as it seeks backing for controversial waterfront project ahead of key Oct. 31 deadline

Full text: Google affiliate Sidewalk Labs has been trying to win the support of Canada’s venture-capital community in the months leading up to a crucial make-or-break deadline for its proposal to develop a high-tech neighbourhood on Toronto’s waterfront.
The New York urban-planning firm co-hosted a dinner for about 15 venture capitalists (VCs) and other investors on the rooftop patio of the Broadview Hotel in Toronto’s east end in July with hopes to sell them on the controversial project. It was co-hosted by the Canadian Venture Capital and Private Equity Association, or CVCA.
Among those in attendance were CVCA chief executive Kim Furlong and chair Peter Dowse; Sidewalk head Dan Doctoroff; Mark Skapinker, managing partner of Brightspark Ventures; Janet Bannister, partner at Real Ventures; and Bruce Croxon, managing partner of Round 13 Capital.
The Alphabet Inc. subsidiary Sidewalk has since been taking meetings with local VCs and startups whose interests might align with the kind of city-centric technology it hopes to implement in its Toronto project, including at the Canadian Innovation Exchange conference in Toronto last week. Sidewalk revealed in its June draft master plan that it wanted to seed $10million into a venture fund for local, early-stage companies focused on “urban innovation” and is seeking co-investors to grow the fund.
Tripartite development agency Waterfront Toronto awarded Sidewalk the right to plan a 12acre plot of prime real estate on the shore of Lake Ontario two years ago this month. Since then, the company has said it hopes to implement technology there that could improve urban life, from AI-powered heating and cooling to adaptive pedestrian crossings to underground freight-andwaste-moving systems.
The company has been on a charm offensive for the past two years as the ranks of its detractors grew from a few vocal tech executives and open-data advocates to include politicians from all three levels of government, renowned academics, intellectual-property lawyers and the Canadian Civil Liberties Association.
The Globe and Mail reported last spring that Sidewalk staff had an exclusive dinner last October with many of Ottawa’s top-ranking deputy ministers at the federal Department of Innovation. The company also has regular meetings with a large “advisory panel” of dozens of urbanists, philanthropists and executives, and regularly lobbies all three levels of government.
Critics have long argued that Canadian technology companies should play a role in developing such a “smart city” community on Toronto’s waterfront and Sidewalk has said it will involve Canadian tech. But few specific details have emerged about what that role would look like, even as Sidewalk and Waterfront Toronto negotiate terms of their latest deal ahead of an Oct. 31 deadline.
The project has polarized the country’s tech community, with critics such as BlackBerry pioneer Jim Balsillie arguing that Canadians stand to lose out on massive future revenue opportunities from Sidewalk-developed technologies. Others, such as Clearbanc co-founders Michele Romanow and Andrew D’Souza, have thrown their support behind the project, calling it a catalyst for the tech sector.
That tension extended to tech investors who were invited to the Sidewalk and CVCA’s dinner.
Some VCs who were invited decided to stay away because of frustrations about how Sidewalk was addressing concerns from the tech community. The meeting focused on selling the benefits of the Sidewalk project in general, rather than a specific opportunity to co-invest in Sidewalk’s fund. Sources invited to the meeting were granted confidentiality by The Globe, owing to fear of damaging business relationships.
Brightspark VC Mr. Skapinker said that while there were some pointed discussions about Sidewalk’s support for Canadian venture, “it was quite a positive meeting.” Mr. Croxon, who attended only briefly, said he remained concerned about the Sidewalk project’s unanswered questions.
Without guarantees around Canadian benefits from the project’s intellectual property, “I am not in favour of blindly going ahead,” he said in an interview. (Ms. Bannister declined to comment, but confirmed her attendance.)
Sidewalk’s director of investments is Nicole LeBlanc, who joined from the Business Development Bank of Canada last year.
Sidewalk declined to make anyone available for an interview for this story because of its continuing negotiations with Waterfront Toronto.
Details of its venture fund are expected to be revealed in the coming weeks, should both Waterfront Toronto and Sidewalk agree to proceed after their Oct. 31 deadline.
The CVCA’s Ms. Furlong said in an interview that Ms. LeBlanc suggested to meet with the venture-capital community after Sidewalk published its draft master plan in June in order to share details. “One of the key pillars of our organization is to connect people for co-investments and deal flow,” Ms. Furlong said. “It was a dinner to network, and for Sidewalk Labs to talk about the plan that had just been released.”
In August, Sidewalk joined forces with the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan to launch an infrastructure-investment company that would invest in projects across North America.

Full text: Y ears ago, Google search-result pages were simple. Web searchers would type in a query and their results would include a few ads at the top of the page, followed by 10 unpaid links to websites that Google believed to be most relevant to what they were searching for.
Google’s algorithm steadily improved, making better matches between search queries and results. This attracted more searchers, which in turn attracted more advertisers. It was a win-win-win scenario. Searchers found what they wanted, website owners received quality traffic to their websites and Google got paid (upon ad clicks).
Google search is now a complex landscape, with many more potential sections appearing in a search-engine result page (SERP).
Besides the ads at the top and the 10 organic results at the bottom, a Google search could return results from Google Images, Google Maps, YouTube, Google News, Google Travel, weather, sports, social media and Q&A boxes, all competing for space inside the SERP. This has led to the rise of two things: more clicks going to Google-related properties and more web searches resulting in no clicks at all.
It’s clear who’s winning in this scenario: website searchers and Alphabet, Google’s parent company.
Searchers, particularly those on mobile devices, can now get faster results to what they’re looking for. They no longer have to click through to websites to go hunting for information – they can find answers right inside Google. An estimated 49 per cent of Google searches in the United States in the first quarter of 2019 resulted in no clicks at all.
Google itself is also winning, with an estimated 6 per cent of search results in the same time going to Alphabet-owned properties. It’s one of the reasons why 50 U.S. states have launched a joint antitrust probe into Google.
But website owners are no longer winning. It’s estimated that Google sent 20 per cent fewer organic clicks from web-browser searches to websites in 2019 than 2016. How can a small business be seen, found and get clicks to their website in this new ecosystem, short of buying Google Ads?
Toronto-based search-engine optimization consultant Paul Teitelman says the answer lies in the content structure of a business’s website. “It’s about understanding what type of formatting that Google is showcasing,” Mr. Teitelman says. “Once you understand what they’re looking for, you can restructure your own content to respond to that.”
One area that small businesses can appear in Google SERPs is inside Google Maps and Google Business listings.
Businesses can create a free listing and submit a company description, location, interior and exterior photos, hours of operation and other details. Having a complete Google Business listing will increase the visibility of an organization in local search results and in Google Maps.
Another prominent piece of Google SERP real estate that a small business may be able to claim is the “featured snippet” box, also known as an “answer box.” It’s the area of a Google search that sometimes appears before the 10 organic search results, when a search takes the form of a question.
The featured snippet box displays the question and an excerpt from a website that Google believes best answers the question.
These Q&A boxes include a link to the source website. An experiment performed by marketing software company HubSpot suggests that the likelihood of receiving a click is two times higher in a featured snippet box than in organic search results. That could make a big difference to a small business.
To try to appear in featured snippet boxes, website owners should present website content in structured sections. Headings, subheadings and lists are key. Include questions in headings, followed by the answer to that question in a paragraph or a list. That way, Google is more likely to display an excerpt from the website in a featured snippet box when a searcher makes a similar query.
Optimizing website content for featured snippet boxes doesn’t mean website owners need to overhaul their sites. Existing content can be repurposed to be more search friendly, as long as it’s quality content that provides value to website visitors.
“The opportunity to refresh existing content has never been stronger,” Mr. Teitelman says.
Revamping website content for featured snippet boxes has another possible benefit: It can improve the likelihood of appearing in voice search results, which often take a Q&A format.
Consistent change within Google is all but guaranteed, and it can be difficult for a small business to keep up. While organic search will never disappear, it will likely continue to change in format. As search evolves, businesses that adapt their digital content strategy to take advantage of every opportunity for visibility will thrive.

Full text: B.C.’s Ministry of Education will inspect St. George’s private school in Vancouver after a group of boys were caught sharing racist materials on social media and in the school, resulting in what is believed to be more than a dozen suspensions and expulsions this week.
The school would not make anyone available for an interview and would not answer specific questions about the allegations. Samantha Wink, head of communications for the school, provided a short statement confirming a “number” of students engaged in “deeply offensive behaviour online and in the school,” leading to an unspecified number of suspensions and expulsions.
The school says it contacted its Vancouver Police schoolliaison officer who said the matter was not criminal in nature.
However, Vancouver Police spokesman Steve Addison said Friday that it is still “very much under investigation” and no conclusions have been drawn yet.
The ministry said the inspection will take place in November to ensure that the school’s policies and operations are in line with the Independent School Act.
“B.C.’s schools are places of learning; racism is unacceptable and not tolerated,” the ministry said in a statement issued Friday.
“Any report of racist behaviour is very concerning.”
St. George’s, located on Vancouver’s west side, is an elite private school that calls itself “Canada’s World School for Boys.” Basic tuition for a junior student from British Columbia is listed at $23,740, while a boarding student from anywhere in Canada will pay $52,570, according to the school’s website.
Headmaster Tom Matthews, who earlier this month announced that he will soon retire, sent a letter to parents and other members of the St. George’s community advising them of the disciplinary actions on Friday.
“Like youth around the world, many of our students are actively engaged in social media. Unfortunately, research suggests that there has been an upsurge in the sharing of offensive or discriminatory material,” he wrote.
“Teenagers may feel that this content is humorous and may be motivated by adolescent immaturity; however, this behaviour undermines our school’s values and community standards.”
Dr. Matthews said the school has been “working hard to increase our students’ awareness of social issues and to build respect for diversity and inclusion.”
Alex Tsakumis, a local real estate developer and past president of the school’s alumni association, said his contacts working at the school have said a teacher discovered the Grade 10 students using their phones during class to share the hateful content over social media.
He criticized his alma mater for waiting until the issue was reported in the media before it sent a note to parents.
He also said it was unacceptable that some of the more than a dozen students involved were expelled while others were suspended.
“Anyone involved in trading that kind of information on social media that is a student at St. George’s doesn’t belong at St. George’s, period – end of story,” said Mr. Tsakumis, who used to run a colourful blog on B.C. politics.
“It doesn’t matter who your dad or your mom is, or how much money they’ve given to the school or your status in the school. If you’re stupid enough to do something like that, you shouldn’t be in that school.”
The school’s code of conduct prohibits bullying, which includes verbal abuse and threats, unwelcome remarks about a person’s race and religion, and misusing technology to hurt, intimidate, embarrass or humiliate others.

Full text: Carbon pricing LIBERALS When Justin Trudeau’s government signed on to the 2015 Paris accord, it joined a global consensus that humancaused climate change threatens millions of lives unless emissions are cut aggressively, and now. A federal carbon-pricing program, which took effect early this year, taxes provinces that don’t have equivalent pricing or cap-and-trade regimes, but compensates individuals with rebates. If re-elected, the Liberals will keep raising the per-tonne price – from $20 now to $50 by 2022 – and are aiming for net-zero Canadian emissions by 2050. But the Liberals’ own numbers predict Canada will still fall short of its 2030 targets.
CONSERVATIVES Leader Andrew Scheer opposes the carbon-pricing system, vowing that his party would repeal it and instead use tax incentives, levies on large industrial polluters and spending on carbon-capture technology.
Modelling of the plan’s impact by Mark Jaccard, a Simon Fraser University researcher who sits on the UN’s advisory panel on climate change, found it would increase emissions between 2020 and 2030.
NDP Jagmeet Singh’s New Democrats would keep the Liberals’ basic framework, but cut rebates to the wealthiest Canadians and shift more of the tax burden to industry. An NDP government would also start a Canadian Climate Bank, create an independent office to monitor emissions cuts and spend $15-billion on a massive green overhaul of Canada’s electrical grid, transit systems and housing stock.
That last part might create jurisdictional friction with provinces, who run hydro networks and enforce building codes.
GREENS Green Leader Elizabeth May says Canada’s targets are too low, and would instead aim for a 60-per-cent reduction below 2005 levels by 2030. To get there, the Greens say they’d raise the carbon price by $10 annually until 2030; invest even more than the NDP in electrical, transit and housing retrofits; and aim for a zero-emission economy by 2050.
Pipelines LIBERALS To persuade former Alberta premier Rachel Notley to agree to the carbon framework, Mr. Trudeau promised to back the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion from Edmonton to the B.C. coast. Since then, his government has bought the pipeline system for $4.5-billion and pushed to get it reapproved after a court challenged the National Energy Board to do more Indigenous consultations. British Columbia and many First Nations along the route oppose the project, and Ms. Notley’s successor, Jason Kenney, has threatened aggressive measures to get it finished. Meanwhile, environmentalists say Mr. Trudeau’s support for Trans Mountain undermines Canada’s climate goals – notwithstanding the two billion trees Mr. Trudeau plans to plant with the oil revenue.
CONSERVATIVES Mr. Scheer, a political ally of Mr. Kenney’s, also supports Trans Mountain and accuses the Liberals of mishandling the dispute with B.C. He says a Conservative government would fast-track legal challenges to oil pipelines straight to the Supreme Court to get final decisions faster. Meanwhile, he is courting the oil patch with promises to scrap carbon pricing, create a national energy corridor and eliminate Bill C-69, a law requiring more regulators to take human health and the environment into account when approving resource projects.
NDP Mr. Singh wants to cancel the Trans Mountain expansion, end federal subsidies for fossil fuels, shift toward fully electric-powered transit and give Canadians incentives to switch to zero-emission vehicles.
GREENS Ms. May, who was once arrested at a demonstration against Trans Mountain, says the Greens would cancel the project and reject any new pipelines, oil and gas drilling or coal mining. They would cancel fossil-fuel subsidies and ban hydraulic-fracking operations. They want existing oil-and-gas projects phased out in the 2030s, by which point they hope to have a 100-per-cent renewable electricity supply.
Housing LIBERALS The Trudeau government introduced a mortgage stress test in 2018 to keep price growth in check in Canada’s hot housing markets.
The real estate industry has argued that it excludes too many people from owning homes, but Mr. Trudeau is staying put on the stress test, and adding a first-time home-buyer incentive. The Liberals would also crack down on property speculation with a consistent national tax on foreign-owned vacant properties and a joint effort with provinces to combat financial crimes in real estate.
CONSERVATIVES Mr. Scheer wants to let home buyers amortize their insured mortgages for 30 years, up from the current limit of 25. That could lower buyers’ monthly costs, but also encourage them to gamble on more expensive properties and end up in deeper debt. The Conservative platform promises to “fix” the stress test, but doesn’t say how, other than to say it should be removed for mortgage renewals. If Mr. Scheer’s fixes weaken the test, some industry analysts fear it could reinflame the housing market.
NDP Mr. Singh says the NDP would create 500,000 affordable housing units over 10 years and waive the federal portion of the GST/HST on new affordable rental units. The NDP would also add to foreignbuyers’ taxes in B.C. and Ontario with a national 15-per-cent tax on home purchases by those who aren’t citizens or permanent residents.
GREENS Ms. May wants to create a dedicated federal housing minister to tailor long-term affordable housing solutions to each province, would have new and existing housing redesignated as infrastructure so it can be funded through the Canada Infrastructure Bank, and would refocus the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. from commercial lenders to affordable non-market housing. She would also eliminate the first-time home-buyer grant.
Jobs and the economy LIBERALS Currently, wages in federal jobs hew to whatever the local province’s minimum wage is, but the Liberals, as with the NDP and Greens, are proposing a $15-an-hour minimum (although if the provincial wage is higher than that, the Liberals say the highest wage would take precedence). Mr. Trudeau would also introduce a “Canada Training Benefit,” better guarantees for apprenticeship training and a “Career Insurance Benefit” to compensate people laid off when their employers’ business closes.
CONSERVATIVES Mr. Scheer has concentrated his job-creation rhetoric on the oil sands, promising that the Trans Mountain pipeline and other new energy ventures will employ tens of thousands of people. He also wants to undo most of the Liberals’ tax changes for small businesses, which were designed to keep high-income earners from exploiting tax laws to pay less.
NDP The New Democrats’ platform promises 300,000 “good jobs” in Canada within four years. That’s 75,000 jobs a year, a modest amount by recent standards (the country’s net gain for August was 81,100 jobs, although that was larger than usual and most new jobs were part time). New Democrats would change employment-insurance rules to give students and workers more job training, pour new money into the auto, aerospace and forestry industries and reaffirm support for supply management in Canada’s international trade deals.
GREENS The green retrofits to Canada’s buildings alone will create more than four million jobs, the Green platform says, citing trade-union research. The party also promises a guaranteed livable income, a “just transition” to give oil sands workers new jobs, investment in job training for a green economy and the creation of a Community and Environment Service Corps to employ young people.
LIBERALS This past spring, Quebec’s government enacted legislation barring certain public servants, including teachers, from wearing religious garments such as turbans, hijabs and niqabs. Premier François Legault argued it was a step forward for official secularism, but to Mr. Trudeau, it was a step backward that enshrined religious discrimination into law. Bill 21 is being challenged in a Quebec court, but the federal government has not intervened, although Mr. Trudeau hasn’t ruled out doing so in the future.
CONSERVATIVES Mr. Scheer also opposes Bill 21, but says its legality should be tested in court, and a Conservative government would not intervene against it.
NDP Mr. Singh – whose election ads in Quebec have played up his status as a turban-wearing Sikh with a message of inclusion – thinks Bill 21 is discriminatory, but also says an NDP government would stay out of the court challenge.
GREENS Ms. May condemned Bill 21 when it was introduced, but hasn’t instructed Green candidates to do likewise. That’s not uncommon with the Green Party, which is more decentralized than other parties and allows candidates to oppose official policies. The Greens did, however, ask before the election that candidates use caution when talking about the issue.
Indigenous policies LIBERALS Mr. Trudeau, who ran in 2015 on promises of reconciliation, but met resistance from many First Nations over his support for oil pipelines, is doubling down in this election by vowing to hold Canada’s laws to standards set in the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP). The Liberals have pledged to eliminate all long-term drinking-water advisories on reserve, of which there are currently more than 50. At the same time, the government says it will appeal a Canadian Human Rights Tribunal decision urging compensation for Indigenous children unnecessarily brought into the child-welfare system.
CONSERVATIVES Similar to the 2015 platform of his predecessor, Stephen Harper – whose environmental policies triggered the Idle No More movement of 2012-13 – Mr. Scheer’s platform focuses on Indigenous economic prosperity, arguing that bureaucracy and outdated Indigenous governance are obstacles to that. Mr. Scheer would also create a dedicated cabinet job for consulting with Indigenous people on major natural-resources projects and “increase support for organizations that facilitate engagement between Indigenous groups and resource development companies.” Like Mr. Trudeau, Mr. Scheer supports Ottawa’s challenge of the human-rights tribunal ruling on Indigenous child welfare.
NDP The New Democrats would set up a “National Council for Reconciliation” to oversee a planned overhaul of natural-resources policy, the child-welfare system, education, infrastructure and health care. The NDP would fully implement UNDRIP. Mr. Singh would also spend $1.8-billion to bring clean water to every Indigenous community.
GREENS Ms. May wants to give Indigenous nations a process to opt out of the Indian Act, the law governing most federal-Indigenous relations. The Greens would also set up an independent land-claims arbitrator and implement UNDRIP, the recommendations of a 1996 royal commission on Indigenous issues and the calls to action of the Truth and Reconciliation report.
Taxes LIBERALS The Liberals’ broadest tax proposal is to raise the basic personal tax-free amount, currently $12,069, to $15,000 by 2023. New revenue would come from a luxury-items tax, eliminating tax breaks for high-income earners and increasing taxes for large companies. The Parliamentary Budget Office review has expressed doubts about whether this will produce as much revenue as the Liberals expect. The Liberal plan would also leave the government in deficit with no timeline for balanced budgets.
CONSERVATIVES A proposed “universal tax cut,” costing slightly more than the Liberals’ plan, would cut the tax rate to 13.75 per cent from 15 per cent on annual income between $12,069 and $47,630. The Conservatives also want to restore Harper-era tax breaks that the Liberals deemed too costly and eliminated, such as the credits for public transit, arts and sports education programs for children. Over all, the Conservatives say they would run balanced budgets in five years.
NDP The party’s “new deal for tax fairness” would raise the corporate tax rate to 18 per cent from the current 15 per cent, tax wealth greater than $20million by 1 per cent and avoid broad tax cuts, such as those the Liberals and Conservatives propose.
GREENS The Green platform’s corporate-tax hike is three percentage points higher than the NDP’s, and it proposes the same tax on wealth greater than $20-million. No changes are proposed to personal tax rates. A PBO analysis says it’s highly uncertain how much revenue would be raised by the Greens’ tax increases.
Foreign policy LIBERALS Mr. Trudeau famously said in 2015 that “Canada is back” after the Harper government frayed ties to many international institutions. But he came under criticism from the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development for falling short of restoring Canada’s foreign-aid budget to levels under the Harper government. In this election, the Liberals are reaffirming their feminist foreign-assistance policy and increasing aid spending annually toward 2030.
CONSERVATIVES The Tories want to focus foreign-aid efforts on poor countries such as Haiti, Afghanistan or the countries of subSaharan Africa, but slash the current $6-billion foreign-aid budget by $1.5-billion, a 25per-cent reduction. Mr. Scheer, who has said he is personally anti-abortion, says those cuts wouldn’t affect Canada’s global prochoice initiatives.
NDP The New Democrats want to rededicate Canada to global peacekeeping and raise foreign aid to 0.7 per cent of gross national income. They would spend more on health initiatives such as the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and, similar to the Liberals, they say they would make the rights of women and girls a cornerstone of their foreign-policy agenda.
GREENS The foreign-policy section of the Greens’ platform mentions no foreign-aid priorities and is much more focused on domestic military affairs. It calls for more resources and training for the military to defend the North as Arctic ice melts, and to “normalize the deployment of military personnel to protect civilians and communities from extreme forest fires, flooding and storms caused by climate change.” Gun control LIBERALS After 2018’s Danforth shooting in Toronto, Mr. Trudeau assigned one of his cabinet ministers to study a national ban on handguns. Those are the weapons of choice in most Canadian mass shootings, unlike the military-style assault-rifle attacks seen in the U.S. But the gun-control plan Mr. Trudeau unveiled in September instead focuses on banning and buying back assault rifles, leaving any handgun bans to municipalities and provinces.
In Toronto, where the mayor and city council support a handgun ban but the Ontario Premier doesn’t, it’s unclear how any ban could succeed under the Liberals’ proposal.
CONSERVATIVES Mr. Scheer is the only federal leader to own guns, and has advocated for “honest firearms owners” ever since he ran for his party’s leadership. He has proposed to take away the RCMP’s powers to reclassify guns, and create an ombudsman to act on gun owners’ behalf.
In this campaign, his “A Safer Canada” plan proposes new mandatory sentences for gang- and gun-smuggling-related crimes and lifetime firearms bans for those deemed violent offenders.
NDP The NDP’s platform document pledges to “work to keep assault weapons and illegal handguns off our streets, and to tackle gun smuggling and organized crime.” It does not propose new types of firearms restrictions, although Mr. Singh has previously supported giving cities more power to ban handguns.
GREENS Ms. May has proposed a buyback program for handguns and assault weapons, as well as redirecting Canada Border Service Agency efforts to combat weapons smuggling.
Immigration LIBERALS Mr. Trudeau walked a fine line during his term in office between welcoming more immigrants, including tens of thousands fleeing Syria’s civil war, and discouraging asylum seekers from crossing the U.S.-Canada border. The most recent Liberal target is 350,000 immigrants by 2021, up from 310,000 in 2018, but the party platform site says only that the party will “move forward with modest and responsible increases to immigration.”
It also promises to work with the U.S. government to “modernize” the Safe Third Country Agreement, which includes a loophole leading to the large numbers of border crossers.
CONSERVATIVES Earlier this year, Mr. Scheer’s main immigration-policy speech emphasized “fairness, order and compassion,” but didn’t set a target number of newcomers, saying only that levels would be “consistent with what is in Canada’s best interests.” He also said he’d close the Safe Third Country Agreement loophole and stop unauthorized border crossings, but it’s unclear how.
NDP The New Democrat platform, which also doesn’t set an immigration target, stresses that immigration should match Canadian labour needs and that clearing backlogs for family reunification should be a priority. Mr. Singh, arguing that the United States under President Donald Trump is not a safe country for refugees, would suspend the Safe Third Country Agreement and let asylum seekers claim refugee status at official crossings.
GREENS The Greens would increase immigration over all, give foreign professionals easier access to the credentials they need to work here and cancel the Temporary Foreign Workers Program, addressing labour-force shortages with more immigration instead. They would also terminate the Safe Third Country Agreement.
Child care LIBERALS Past Liberal budgets have pledged $7.5-billion over a decade to expand child care across Canada, but universal daycare became a more distant dream when one of Mr. Trudeau’s major partners in the child-care framework – the Ontario Liberal government of Kathleen Wynne – was defeated last year. The federal Liberal platform promises spending that would cut before- and afterschool child-care fees by 10 per cent, and increase the Canada Child Benefit by up to $1,000 for children under a year old.
CONSERVATIVES Mr. Scheer has pledged to revive two Harper-era refundable tax credits for families enrolling children in sport and artistic learning programs. Only children at the age of 16 and under would be eligible, and the 15-per-cent tax credit would apply to a maximum of $1,000 for sports programs and $500 for arts programs. Mr. Scheer also wants to make employment-insurance benefits tax-free for new parents.
NDP The New Democratic platform calls for “legislation that enshrines Canada’s commitment to high-quality, public child care in law,” singling out Quebec as a model to follow and pledging $1-billion in federal child-care funding in 2020, with annual increases after that.
GREENS The Greens plan to work with provinces and First Nations on “a road map to affordable child care for all children,” and would raise federal funding to eventually reach at least 1 per cent of GDP a year. The Greens would also exempt child-care-related construction costs from the GST.
Pharmacare LIBERALS After commissioning two major fact-finding studies that each concluded Canada needs universal pharmacare, the Liberals embraced the idea – but only up to a point. Mr. Trudeau billed his $6-billion, four-year health plan as a “down payment” on pharmacare, but acknowledged a re-elected Liberal government would have to negotiate with provinces first.
CONSERVATIVES Mr. Scheer has opposed national pharmacare in the past. His platform’s only mention of public drug coverage is a pledge to work with provinces and territories to find ways to reduce the cost of “orphan drugs” that treat rare diseases.
NDP Mr. Singh’s plan would enact Canada Health Act-style legislation to make pharmacare happen by the end of 2020, and he’s promised $10-billion a year in federal money. A national formulary would make a list of drugs that would have at least one version available at no cost, or a $5 co-pay for those who want brand-name drugs with available generic equivalents.
GREENS As with Mr. Singh, Ms. May wants pharmacare introduced by 2020, but she’s promised to have Ottawa pick up the full tab for the first two years. That would cost about $26.76-billion in 2020-21, rising to nearly $40-billion (including provincial contributions) in 2028-29, according to the Parliamentary Budget Officer.

Tiny houses, big resistance: Organizers celebrate a win as homeless veterans prepare to move into Calgary community

Full text: Tiny homes may be a hit on TV reality shows, but they can generate unease and resistance when people see entire tiny communities being planned for their neighbourhoods.
Who will live in these tinyhome communities? Will they lead to a degradation of the neighbourhood? Will property values be affected?
Recent history in Alberta shows that how well a developer deals with those fears beforehand will determine the success of their project.
Next month, homeless veterans will begin moving into a community of 15 tiny homes in Calgary’s Forest Lawn neighbourhood.
“The project really wouldn’t happen without the support of the local community of businesses, individuals and social groups,” says David Howard, president and co-founder of the Homes for Heroes Foundation. “All the money was raised through donations.”
The homes measure just less than 300 square feet. “They are beautiful homes. It’s all hardwood floors, ceiling fans, vaulted ceilings skylight, top-end appliances,” Mr. Howard says.
The veterans will have on-site access to a range of services including one-on-one counselling, occupational therapy, physician care, education, training and help finding employment.
The foundation is already working on another tiny-home community for veterans in Edmonton’s Evansdale neighbourhood and has plans to expand to three sites in Ontario, in London, Kingston and either Hamilton or Ottawa.
In Calgary, it’s estimated there are between 160 and 180 homeless veterans. In Edmonton, the figure is between 180 and 210.
Despite the fact that the Calgary project was for veterans, organizers knew there would be resistance.
“I think there is certainly a small percentage [of people] that have a concern in regards to the type of people that are coming in to their community and we have this mentality of Not In My Back Yard,” Mr. Howard says. “But I also believe that once they understand the build, what we’re putting in and how we’re doing it and the type of people that actually are moving in – [people who have] stood on guard for our country – they really have no further concerns.”
The veterans’ projects are planned within existing residential areas and that means working with the community to explain the merits of the plans and address their concerns.
In Calgary and Edmonton, they held holding open houses, answered questions and sought feedback on the look and design of the projects, the homes and the open spaces, to ensure that there’s a good fit with the neighbourhood.
The result is that locals are excited about the opening in Calgary and are protective of the project, Mr. Howard says. “Overall, we’ve had amazing support within the communities in Calgary and in the neighbourhood of Edmonton.” It was a different story in Okotoks, a town about 45 kilometres south of Calgary with a population of about 30,000. There, a plan to provide 42 tiny-homes in a new community was shot down after concerns raised by some residents.
Okotoks Mayor Bill Robertson says: “One of the unfortunate parts about this is that I had a letter from someone basically saying this is a glorified trailer park and when you build a trailer park you are going to attract ‘trailer trash.’ That was the exact term used.”
He adds: “That is so negative and unfortunate that we would have those people that put a stigma on people living in a certain type of housing. We have a mobile park in Okotoks and there are just some fantastic, salt-of-the-earth people that live there; that take care of their homes, that are model citizens.”
The Okotoks project would have provided homes at two sizes, either 380 square feet or 550 square feet. It would have included a mix full ownership, market rentals and subsidized rentals.
The town embarked on the project because the lack of affordable housing had been the No. 2 issue in the town elections two years ago. As a bedroom community for Calgary, house prices in Okotoks are generally expensive.
“When you don’t have affordable housing, then there’s a certain socio-economic group in your community that really suffers.
Those people that can afford housing can pay the extra money, but there are those that can’t afford it and are forced to leave the community,” Mr. Robertson says.
It affects the economic vitality of the community, he says, pointing out that it wasn’t long ago that a local fast-food restaurant couldn’t open in the evening because it couldn’t find workers.
Demand for the tiny homes was such that there were between 300 and 400 people keen to get into the project, he says.
“There were so many positive attributes, I didn’t foresee the negativity rising up against it,” the mayor says. “We were a little remiss in letting the ‘negative Nellies,’ so to speak, get hold … of social media – and social media can run rampant. I don’t think we countered with enough … accurate information.”
The Calgary tiny-homes community will be run by the Mustard Seed, a local social services agency that has been working to reduce poverty and homelessness since the 1980s.
The tiny-homes community approach is “a great model and we at the Mustard Seed would like to explore that in non-veterans communities as well,” says Stephen Wile, Mustard Seed CEO.
There will, however, be resistance, he says.
“I think part of it is there is the ‘ghetto’ mindset. … [that] we’re going to create a ghetto here. But what people don’t understand is that those of us who are working in social services as non-profits, our intention is not to create a worse place for people to live, our intention is to produce a better place for people to live so that they can move to that place of wellness. If we are creating slums, then we are not solving people’s problems,” Mr. Wile says.
“Really, what you have to do is you have to deal with people’s fears.”
When you address those issues through dialogue with the community, you can overcome the fear, he says.
Mr. Howard of Homes for Heroes agrees. “Involving the community is a great thing and I think that you might find that when you do that, then you get better support, but when you blindside people and try to jam it down their throat … I think that’s when people get defensive.”
With the right approach, he says the tiny-homes model could work to provide affordable housing in communities of varying sizes. “I think it’s a brilliant idea,” he says.
In Calgary, there’s need for 15,000 affordable homes. About 90 per cent of those who need them are the working poor, people on minimum wage who want a stable home environment, he says. “We need to give a little more respect for that.”
Tiny homes would also be a boon you younger people.
“Our younger generation … they have no interest in purchasing a home. They feel that it is gone for them, they don’t have that opportunity any more.
Houses [have become] too expensive,” Mr. Howard says.
“There is so much more opportunity. I think that if you developed a community of tiny homes for any demographic, you could have the ability to sell these for anywhere from $100,000 to $150,000. … People would be able to afford a mortgage for that. People in Calgary have cars that are worth twice that.”

Full text: 15 Bramley St. N.
PORT HOPE, ONT.
Asking Price: $424,900 Taxes: $2,554 (2019) Lot Size: 19 feet by 92 feet Agent: Scott Ingram, Century 21 Regal Realty Inc.
THE BACKSTORY When Sally McCubbin first purchased the sturdy little terrace house at 15 Bramley St. N. in Port Hope, Ont., back in 2013, it was part of a plan to start a new glassblowing venture in town and escape the hustle and bustle of Toronto. As fate would have it, that passion project did not materialize, but out of her Port Hope adventure, she would gain a husband, a child and a move back to Toronto. After renting the house out for a few years, the couple think it’s time to close this chapter and say goodbye to smalltown living.
“It was just really affordable at the time,” Ms. McCubbin said. “I was attracted to it because it has a really urban feel; ticks off a lot of boxes. When I first moved there, there was a lot of people who had retired to Port Hope and a lot of local business owners. More recently, we’re seeing people who work remotely, or [are] moving businesses out there, or there are people that commute into the city. The landscape of Port Hope is quite hip. There’s a bunch of coffee shops, good restaurants, good bars and a historical backdrop.”
There’s a great deal of conversation in federal politics about housing “affordability” – whether it be through relaxing mortgage stress tests or expanding firsttime home buyer tax credits – and in the Greater Toronto Area, the context is often described as “drive until you can qualify.”
Simply put, Port Hope is an hour from Toronto, but it’s a different country in terms of price: Houses here are essentially half the price of the average Toronto home (and Toronto’s median prices are held down by lowerprice high-rise condos).
In 2013, the median sales price for a Port Hope house was about $225,000. By the second quarter of 2019, Port Hope’s median sales price was $438,500. That’s a slight dip from the spiking prices of 2017, but the trend remains an upward one. Admittedly, volumes are very low: About 18 houses sell every month in the town, which reported
16,753 residents in 2016’s census.
“To buy the same house in Toronto, it would still be three times the price in Parkdale,” Ms. McCubbin said. The couple considered keeping the house as an investment, or even a “country” getaway, but in the end, decided selling makes more sense. “We’re just not cut out to be landlords; it does the house disservice to have someone in there that doesn’t care about it,” Ms. McCubbin said.
THE HOUSE TODAY The little terrace house has about 1,264 square feet of living space, but it’s packed with charm. From the street, you gain a sense of the strong craftsmanship found within: Red brick is the main colour, but yellow bricks were added to highlight such features as intricate block cornices along the roofline (three corbelled bricks stacked to form what is called a modillion), alternating-colour soldier courses (vertically stacked bricks) above the windows and string-courses (a band of coloured brick) that form corbels above the window frames.
It’s the only house in the row of six that has a covered front porch (not original, but a tasteful addition).
A little historical digging by listing agent Scott Ingram suggests the building was constructed around 1875, part of local grocer Thomas Menhennit’s attempts at land speculation that ended poorly: death from “dropsy” and insolvency. Down the street on the corner of Ridout Street and Bramley Street North is Basil’s Market & Deli, located in Menhennit’s original store.
The front vestibule is a modest little square. Through the inner door, you come into the mainfloor’s central hallway, with wideplank floors and a staircase that climbs up the wall on the right and takes an elegant curve to the left at the top of the run. These spaces can be purely functional in some houses, but in this house, with two well-lit rooms opening off the left, they are inviting.
At the end of this hallway is the main-floor powder room, which also has the washer and dryer and wood-panelled walls. There is also a doorway to the basement, which is unfinished, but it is dry and – unlike a lot of basements of this vintage in Port Hope – it is concrete, not simply bare dirt, as with many old country homes.
The front sitting room and the formal dining room are connected by an archway with pillars. The broad plank pine floor (refinished by Ms. McCubbin) is complemented by modern furnishings, clean white walls and simple lines. The tall windows let light in on both exterior walls – all the windows in the house were replaced by the couple. Visitors should take notice of the rosecoloured glass piece labelled “fish” on the coffee table; that’s from a series of glassworks Ms. McCubbin did on Canada’s greatest resource exports.
The space feels more farmhouse than townhouse.
“There’s a ton of cool details in this house; the old staircase is beautiful, details up the stairs and spindles, old baseboards and old doors,” said Clayton Hanmer, Ms. McCubbin’s husband who is also known as the cartoonist and illustrator CTON. “And the special façade on the buildings … no wonder the guy went broke.”
The kitchen is one of the areas the sellers did the most work on: exposing the brick, making a jumbled area into a more natural galley-style space. The counters are butcher’s block and there are no upper cabinets, so the kitchen feels bigger than its 11-foot-by-9foot layout, not that you would call this an eat-in space. To make up for the cabinet space, one just has to turn to the left and there’s a mudroom with a wall full of pantry storage, more brick (painted now) and a glass-pane door to the rear yard.
In the yard, straight back from that rear door, is the small detached studio space. Designed and built by Mr. Hanmer (although contractors were called in for the structural stuff,) it has the same pale pine wood panelling on the floors, ceiling, window and door trim, plus a loft space for storage. There is baseboard heating and windows on all four sides.
Back to the front of the house and up the stairs is the second level – and no space is wasted here. It’s basically a landing with four doors right next to each other, two on each side.
First door on the right: The crib suggests it’s a baby’s room, 8 feet by 8 feet, (tall window, those plank floors, no closet), but this was also used as a study by the sellers in the past.
Second door on the right: full bath (8 feet by 8 feet) with clawfoot tub and shower, single sink, toilet, linen storage space next to the door. The floor here could use an update, for sure.
First door on the left: fecond bedroom, 7 feet by 9 feet, tall window; at some point someone built out a closet enclosure and we’re back to the plank floors.
Second door on the left: master bedroom, not a vast space at 9 feet by 11 feet, but does have two windows looking out on the street and a reasonable-sized closet (for the era, it’s large).
WHY DRIVE TO QUALIFY?
Agent and sellers emphasize that the house is minutes to the 401 and there are also a couple of GO train options within a short drive.
Add to that the community’s proximity to the big city and the burgeoning culinary and hospitality scene of Prince Edward County (and it’s own maturing local charms) and there’s a case for living in Port Hope even if you don’t work there.
The couple used to spend most of their time in the backyard, shaded by 150-year-old maples, or walking around the community and seeing the dozens of historically significant homes. Several street scenes from the recent movie adaptations of Stephen King’s It were filmed in the town, which may give you a sense of some of the environs given its evocation of frozen-in-time Derry, Me.
In this case, the agent thinks the buyers will look a lot like the sellers. “I think it’s someone from Toronto that doesn’t want to be in a bland subdivision,” Mr. Ingram said. “It’s a cool house and you can walk down the main street in be in the town centre.” Indeed, one of the other houses in the row is currently being renovated by a new arrival looking for just that sort of thing.

Full text: The Water Dancer BY TA-NEHISI COATES PENGUIN RANDOM HOUSE , 446 PAGES
Throughout Ta-Nehisi Coates’s work, whether in the pages of The Atlantic magazine, his bestselling nonfiction books, or in the pages of the Black Panther comic book imprint he helped revive, there is a strain of deep sorrow verging on biblical lamentation. His writing often sketches the contours not only of the profound racialized trauma that empires of white supremacy inflict on their subordinated victims – particularly Black Americans – but of the brutalization and degeneracy the ideology inflicts on white people themselves.
This tendency often seems to position white supremacy as a sort of capricious and unconquerable demigod, operating above the workings of other oppressive ideologies, particularly capitalism and class warfare. For that, Coates has been criticized by the likes of political scientist Adolph Reed and philosopher Dr. Cornel West, the latter accusing Coates of “fetishizing” white supremacy.
However Coates’s critiques are received in our own world, though, the apocalyptic lens through which Coates views white supremacy serves as an excellent backdrop for The Water Dancer, his debut fiction novel. In Coates’s fictional Virginia, not long before the American Civil War, white supremacy infects and spoils everything it touches. From the slowly desiccating soil of tobacco plantations, to the rotting souls of decadent white gentry, to the stunted racial beliefs of abolitionists and even facilitators of the Underground Railroad, this is a story of sin and corruption, a prelude to the fall of Babylon.
The story surrounds Hiram Walker, a house slave and son of the master of the fictional Lockless plantation in Elm County, Va.
Hiram’s mother was sold away when he was young, and though he possesses an eidetic memory and bottomless capacity for ingenuity, he carries barely any memory of her. As he grows older, Hiram is appointed the body man to his oafish white half-brother Maynard, who stands to inherit Lockless and doubtless bring the estate to its final ruin. But during a riding mishap that kills Maynard and almost ends in his own drowning, Hiram discovers he possesses a mythical talent that others describe as “Conduction,” which naturally makes him a recruitment target for agents of the Underground Railroad.
Coates’s ability for worldbuilding, first demonstrated during his Black Panther run, is nothing short of excellent. In this novel, Coates deploys that talent toward scrubbing away the romantic gloss of the antebellum South.
The mood of decay is ever present and almost palpably crumbling, in a way that evokes Stephen King’s worlds in The Dark Tower series. “Bored whites were barbarian whites,” Hiram says, reflecting on a dinner party thrown by his father. “While they played at aristocrats, we were their well-appointed and stoic attendants. But when they tired of dignity, the bottom fell out.” Later, while attending to his white half-brother after the local horse races, the bottom indeed falls out in spectacular fashion, as genteel landowners cant drunkenly through the streets, visit violence upon lesser whites and pass out in piles of manure.
Hiram’s nickname for that highest of castes, Quality, is drenched with irony.
On the other hand, Coates’s mode of world-building carries over poorly when it comes to bringing his characters alive. The white people of Elm County, for example, seem to exist for the sole purpose of exhibiting low barbarism under the cloak of highfalutin aesthetics. The white slave-catchers seem to exist to show how landless whites were more dangerous than anyone, as the boot on their necks only magnified the depravity they inflicted on the only castes below them – slaves and free Blacks. At times, Coates struggles to convey an actual story for the reader to invest in, and it’s in some of these plodding and exposition-heavy moments that it’s difficult to not hear Adolph Reed’s admonishment (“Coates’s message is that white supremacy is transhistorical, transcontextual and always there, with whites committed to it ontologically, then the only thing you can hope for is repenting and individual atonement. Which is cheap and easy.”) Even the other enslaved Black people, abolitionists and Underground Railroad agents Hiram later encounters (including Moses herself, Harriet Tubman) show up to either train him to free slaves, to train him in the way of Conduction or to engage in lengthy stemwinders about their own backgrounds. And here is where Coates runs into another problem – too many of his characters have borrowed his own habit of biblical language, leading to drawnout philosophical expositions.
This makes sense for characters such as the highborn Corinne Quinn, the richest woman in Elm County, as she references fools despising wisdom and Cain slaying his brother for envy. But the Shakespearean soliloquies delivered by other characters, including freed people and recaptured slaves, gives them the feeling of mouthpieces rather than real inhabitants of Hiram’s world.
A few years ago, as a guest for the On Being podcast, Coates talked with host Krista Tippett about his discomfort with the notion of being tied into ground-level activism. “I’m a writer,” Coates said. “I prefer solitude.” It is apparent in Coates’s writing that he is in love with the act of writing, which also requires a love of consumption of literature. And indeed, there are innumerable references in this book to Coates’s literary predecessors, including the Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, Booker T. Washington’s Up From Slavery and Toni Morrison’s Beloved.
But it is also apparent that Coates’s love of solitude has led to a mode of writing that, lately, feels isolated from the genres and traditions he writes in. While The Water Dancer is impressive as Coates’s debut novel, its problems could likely be remedied if Coates got his head out of the books and spent more time around living, breathing people.

Full text: 34 Princess Margaret Blvd., Toronto
PRINCESS ANNE MANOR
Asking price: $3,499,999 Selling price: $3.4-million Taxes: $7,369 (2018) Days on the market: 19 Listing agent: Andrew Ipekian, Keller Williams Referred Urban Realty
THE ACTION Construction on this roughly 4,500-square-foot house wrapped up late last year and it was put on the market this spring. No deal emerged for the luxury home on an 80-foot-by-125-foot lot near St George’s Golf and Country Club, so it was taken off the market and relisted just before the August civic holiday at a price of $3,499,999.
“There were a lot of other new homes in the neighbourhood that were on the market,” agent Andrew Ipekian said.
“[A local resident] came to the open house and ended up buying it.”
WHAT THEY GOT This five-bedroom house is decked out with numerous high-end finishes, from extravagant limestone and gold accent walls in an office to a hidden elevator.
Fireplaces and 10½-foot ceilings add grandeur to areas such as the living room and eat-in kitchen.
All six bathrooms and the basement suite have heated floors.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “It was so beautifully built … a lot of people came through to get building ideas because they loved the architecture so much,” Mr. Ipekian said.
“The elevator was definitely a selling feature for a lot of people whether they needed it or for resale [value] down the road.
“And it had a doggy wash [station], which was also nice.”

Full text: In late September, Markham, Ont., real estate agent Leslie Benczik placed a “for sale” sign on the lawn of a four-bedroom house in a traditional Markham sub-division.
Two days later, a buyer stepped forward and paid just less than the $1.2-million asking price.
That’s the kind of quick action the suburban 905 area around Toronto hasn’t seen in a couple of years.
That same week, Mr. Benczik drew two offers for a more luxurious Markham detached listed with an asking price of $1.488-million.
The four-bedroom house was on the market for about two weeks, he says, when one offer landed on the table. Mr. Benczik notified the real estate agents and potential buyers who had been to see the property that an offer was on the table.
“Finally I was able to draw a second offer out of the woodwork,” he says.
The action wasn’t exactly a 2017-style frenzy, but it does mark a significant pick-up in the pace of buying: Mr. Benczik points out that large, detached suburban houses have been languishing on the market for months at a time.
“A lot of them have gone through multiple price reductions – sometimes with many agents,” he says.
Markham, Aurora, Richmond Hill and King City are some of the areas that were particularly hardhit after the Ontario government of the day introduced a foreignbuyers tax and other measures designed to cool the housing market in April, 2017.
Mr. Benczik recently became the fourth listing agent to tackle one property. In the core districts of Markham, Mr. Benczik estimates only about three or four houses sold in the price range of $1.5-million to $2-million in all of last year.
But the mood has shifted and buyers no longer seem to be waiting around for deeper price cuts.
The latest numbers from the Toronto Real Estate Board show that sales of detached houses in the Greater Toronto Area jumped 29 per cent in September from the same month last year.
That pace outperforms the broader market, which rose at a 22-per-cent clip in September compared with September, 2018.
The average price of a detached house in the 905 rose 4.5 per cent last month compared with the same month last year. The average price of a detached house in the central 416 area code edged up 1.2 per cent last month compared with September, 2018.
TREB says new listings in the GTA dipped 1.9 per cent in September from September of last year. The industry organization says those tightening market conditions lead to an accelerating annual rate of price growth.
At Toronto-Dominion Bank, economist Rishi Sondhi points out that seasonally adjusted sales in Toronto were essentially flat in September compared with August. That performance compares with a strong gain in Vancouver, where activity continues to recover from the extreme lows observed earlier in the year.
“On balance, these performances met our expectations, doing nothing to alter our view that so long as the fundamentals remain intact, housing will contribute positively to growth moving forward,” he says.
In the suburbs, Mr. Benczik says, he can sense the market’s brio through the volume on showings and the number of people passing through weekend “open house” events.
Mr. Benczik says the fact that a few properties in the 905 have attracted competing bidders is evidence of the strong demand and low supply.
“Through the course of 2018, there was a lot of reluctance.”
Sellers have become acclimatized to market realities, he adds, which means that most accept that the record prices of 2017 are in the past.
Recently, the issue of vacant houses has attracted the attention of some politicians. The provincial government of British Columbia rolled out a speculation tax on underutilized or vacant homes in 2018.
Mr. Benczik has seen some suburban neighbourhoods where the trend is noticeable.
“I’m definitely seeing vacant homes.”
Mr. Benczik says the neighbourhoods that appealed to investors during the run-up in 2016 and 2017 are also the areas where many homes appear to be uninhabited.
In some cases, it’s apparent the houses are unoccupied because maintenance of the property is slipping.
“I think that’s where the public gets upset.”
Also, the rental market is tight and that makes the spotlight on vacant homes that much more intense, he adds.
In some cases, the investors are overseas buyers who are reluctant to make the homes available for rental because they’re not sure how long they are going to keep them, Mr. Benczik says, adding it can be hard to sell a property if the tenant is not co-operating.
Some speculators who live overseas are also hesitant to hire a rental management company, he adds, so they let the property sit instead.
Over all, Mr. Benczik says he does not believe policy on housing and other issues under discussion in this month’s federal election are having a large effect on buyers or sellers in the real estate market.
“I haven’t come across anybody delaying their decision because of that.”
Most consumers – particularly if they are buying – are more focused on the direction of interest rates, he says. “That’s been a big conversation in the past couple of years.”
Mr. Benczik says he believes a drop in mortgage rates has encouraged first-time buyers to move into the market and existing homeowners to trade properties in recent months.
A solid client can obtain a fiveyear fixed mortgage with an interest rate of 2.59 per cent, he says.
“Interest rates are at an incredible level.”
Generally, October is the biggest month of the fall market, Mr.Benczik says, and November is often busy, too.
“We’ve still got a lot of the fall market ahead of us.”
Looking ahead at the rest of 2019 and the spring market in 2020, Mr. Benczik cautions that the market is unpredictable. Geopolitical tensions surrounding Brexit and the impeachment investigation of U.S. President Donald Trump are just two of the factors that could roil economies and financial markets.

Full text: Google affiliate Sidewalk Labs’ “smart city” proposal for Toronto’s waterfront could hinge on its supplementary request for control of a 20-acre plot that would surround the tech giant’s relocated Canadian headquarters.
Waterfront Toronto, the trilevel government development agency overseeing the project, has asked Sidewalk Labs to justify why it wants jurisdiction over the land known in planning documents as Villiers West.
The additional land is just one component of the company’s controversial vision for a 190-acre swath of real estate across Toronto’s eastern waterfront – a vision that goes well beyond the original 12-acre parcel reserved for the “smart city” project, known as Quayside.
The two sides are now in talks on a series of issues – including the scope of the project and the data and privacy issues it has raised – that must be resolved by Oct. 31, when either side can choose to walk away from the project.
In an interview, Toronto City Councillor and Waterfront Toronto board member Joe Cressy singled out Sidewalk’s designs on Villiers West as a key stumbling block in the closed-door talks.
“On the simple geography, we feel that there was an overreach,” he said.
“We’ve challenged Sidewalk Labs to come back to us with the city-building solutions that would require an expansion beyond the Quayside land.”
The Villiers West plan is one of several controversial ideas unveiled in the sprawling 1,500-page proposal that Sidewalk Labs, a unit of Mountain View, Calif.based Google parent Alphabet Inc., released in June after months of consultations and controversy.
The futuristic blueprint promises condo towers built of wood instead of concrete, heated bike lanes and self-driving delivery robots that would zip through tunnels.
But the company’s plans to use digital sensors to optimize traffic lights and collect data from citizens have become a source of widespread concern, including from Ontario’s Privacy Commissioner.
Two years ago, Waterfront Toronto selected New York-based Sidewalk Labs as its “innovation and funding partner” for a prototype development limited initially to the 12-acre Quayside plot. In June, the development agency called Sidewalk’s vastly expanded plan premature, and Mr. Cressy described it as a non-starter.
The 20 acres of Villiers West will be part of the future Villiers Island, which is being created in a massive project to reroute the mouth of the Don River, part of a government-funded plan to protect the area from flooding.
In Sidewalk’s vision, Villiers West would play host to a Google campus, as well as what the company calls an urban innovation institute, a tech-industry hub, housing and shops.
Sidewalk would seek to turn a profit as the lead developer for the entire area. It’s a role it is also seeking for Quayside – a role Waterfront Toronto has already dismissed, saying it plans to find a developer through a competitive process.
Mr. Cressy said Sidewalk should not be labelled the prime developer for the lands “as of right,” but he said the company could come in as a partner.
He and Toronto Mayor John Tory have said the offer of a relocated Google Canada headquarters (its offices are now downtown at Richmond and York streets) is at least worth exploring.
In an open letter in the spring, Waterfront Toronto chairman Stephen Diamond outlined his agency’s serious qualms about key elements of Sidewalk’s sprawling plans. Both sides have agreed to resolve the issues he raised by Oct. 31, or the project could be called off. Mr. Diamond would not comment on the talks this week.
In addition to concerns about the proposal’s scope, his June letter asks for more information about Sidewalk’s plans to gather and protect data, saying they must comply with government rules – many of which have yet to be drafted. Mr. Cressy said the privacy concerns remain a key issue in the talks.
Sidewalk has also demanded a funding guarantee for a waterfront light-rail line, something Mr. Diamond’s letter says only governments, not Waterfront Toronto, can provide.
Sidewalk has not clearly spelled out which elements of its massive plan it is willing to jettison and still remain in Toronto. In its June plan, it signalled that being denied an immediate role in the entire 190-acre area – outside Quayside and Villiers West – would not be a deal-breaker, saying its participation in the wider zone was “at the discretion of governments.”
But Sidewalk chief executive Dan Doctoroff said in March that his company could pull out of the project without a public-transit commitment.
Keerthana Rang, a spokeswoman for Sidewalk Labs, declined to comment on the talks.
Local City Councillor Paula Fletcher, a frequent critic of the Sidewalk proposal, rejects what she said would be a massive “sole source contract” for Google at Villiers West, which would see the city offer the company a discount for a coveted piece of waterfront real estate.
“The community has created a vision for the waterfront together over many years, and we should not abandon that vision because one of the biggest corporations in the world – some of the wealthiest people on Earth – want to do it their way,” Ms. Fletcher said.

What Canadians should know – and fear – about deficits before we get too comfortable with red ink

Full text: Barely 3.5 per cent of Canadians named debt and deficits as the most important issue of national concern in the most recent polling done by Nanos Research. That trails the environment (21.7 per cent) and jobs/economy (18.2 per cent) by a hefty margin, and in fact, the number has never exceeded 10 per cent during the past five years of Nanos surveys.
Voters have lost their taste for government austerity since our most recent serious Canadian debt and deficit problem. The last time things approached a crisis was a quarter century ago, now a distant memory. Nearly half of the current voting-age population was too young to vote then; 11 per cent hadn’t even been born yet.
But there could be another reason Canadians tolerate deficits now: a personal financial squeeze that has many feeling that they’re falling behind.
Despite a job boom and an unemployment rate near 40-year lows, wage growth has barely kept up with inflation during the past several years. Meanwhile, rising real estate prices are making homes less affordable.
“A lot of Canadians don’t feel like they’ve been getting ahead,” says Craig Alexander, chief economist at Deloitte Canada. “And because they don’t feel like they’re getting ahead, they’re looking for governments to offer them more.”
Federal parties have responded with promises of higher after-tax income for families and spending more on key priorities, with the understanding of running deficits. Canadians seem to be saying they’re okay with that.
But here are seven things to think about that should give us pause about deficits.
It’s not all about federal deficits.
Provincial debt is ballooning Justin Trudeau’s Liberals like to gloat that Canada has the best balance sheet among the Group of Seven countries. Not true.
That statement leaves out the provinces, whose combined debts, at slightly more than $700-billion, are roughly equal to Ottawa’s debt.
That has to be considered in the overall picture of Canada’s financial health, because it’s the provinces that are responsible for big-budget services such as education and health care – services whose costs will only explode in the years to come.
Canada’s aging population is going to put a lot of pressure on the medical system, and provincial governments don’t have the fiscal capacity they need, Mr. Alexander says. “I’m worried that health care is going to turn into a black hole that consumes all provincial resources,” he says.
Canada has the biggest portion of subsovereign debt among a dozen other countries with triple-A credit ratings, according to Moody’s Investors Service.
More than half of Canada’s debt (about 58 per cent) is at the regional and local level, pushing up Canada’s overall government debt-to-GDP ratio to almost 80 per cent.
And the financial markets and credit agencies have long believed that in a crisis, the federal government would backstop any provincial debt – so, it’s overall government debt that really matters.
When all debt is included, Moody’s says, Canada has one of the highest debt burdens among its peers – and one of the least affordable. The ratings agency estimates that Canada’s interest payments this year equal 7.8 per cent of its revenue and 3.1 per cent of its gross domestic product, the second-weakest in its cohort behind only Italy.
Credit agency Fitch Ratings warned Ottawa in March that sustained deficits will leave Canada more exposed in a recession, and that its combined federal and provincial debt is close a level that’s “incompatible” with a triple-A rating.
Still, Canada has some things going for it. Its credit rating is the best there is, according to Moody’s metrics. Its power to fund its debt with its still-growing economy has improved in the low-interest-rate environment, the ratings company says.
And the country’s large, independently funded public pension funds – the Canada Pension Plan and the Quebec Pension Plan – effectively shield the government’s finances from rising future pension costs as the population ages, setting Canada apart from many other countries.
And while there might be disagreement over the pace at which we balance the books – the Liberals have punted their pledge for zero deficits by 2019 well into the future, while the Conservatives say it will take five years – at least our political leaders appear to agree on that goal, Moody’s says.
“Every generation has to learn about the consequences of excessive borrowing for themselves,” says political scientist and commentator Mark Milke, author of Tax Me I’m Canadian.
Big government is making a comeback The Trudeau government has done more than just reintroduce the notion of routine deficits. It has re-introduced big government – or, at least, bigger government. The spending proposals in its campaign platform would give the government its biggest non-recessionary footprint on the economy in 25 years.
The typical gauge for a government’s size is its program spending as a share of GDP. That shrank dramatically during the deficit-slashing era of the mid-1990s – from more than 16 per cent when the Chrétien government took office in 1993, to less than 12 per cent in the early 2000s. It remained between 12 per cent and 13 per cent during Stephen Harper’s prerecession years.
But the Liberals have reversed that course – modestly, but unmistakably – since taking office in 2015. And their campaign spending proposals would take it further.
In last spring’s budget, the Liberal government envisioned program spending peaking in the 2018-19 fiscal year at 14.6 per cent of GDP, declining to 14.3 per cent this year and continuing to gradually decrease to 13.8 per cent by 2023-24. But under this Liberal platform, program spending now looks set to rise to 14.7 per cent of GDP in 2020-21 and changing little throughout the next mandate; by the 2023 election, it would still be at 14.5 per cent.
Outside of a couple of years around the Great Recession – when the Harper government injected a massive fiscal stimulus – Canada hasn’t a run of sustained spendingto-GDP that high since the mid-1990s. And unlike Harper’s recession stimulus, these aren’t temporary measures.
“Much of [the Liberals’ increased spending] has gone into social spending – which is an annual thing, and it becomes entrenched,” says Joe Oliver, who, as finance minister in the Harper government, was the last finance minister to present a balanced budget, in 2015. “There’s nothing harder in government than cancelling a program – it’s excruciatingly difficult.”
And that’s even if governments stick to their plans, which they don’t. According to a study released over the summer by the C.D. Howe Institute, Canada’s federal, provincial and territorial governments routinely overshoot the targets they set in their annual budgets. Since 2000, they’ve spent $91-billion (some $2,500 for every Canadian) more than they budgeted and raised $142-billion (almost $4,000 for every Canadian) more than they budgeted.
In sum: Our governments spend far more, and tax far more heavily, than even what they promise in their budgets.
Without the rigour of a zero-deficit framework, spending can quickly snowball, C.D.
Howe president Bill Robson says. “When governments start to spend very freehandedly, pretty soon you start getting stories about people expensing packets of gum and $15 glass of orange juice or subsidies to profitable companies and handouts that appear to be very calibrated to swing ridings. Over time, I think people’s tolerance for that is diminished.” Just how big a debt burden are we taking on? One key factor that makes deficits and debts more manageable today is also, conversely, what made them so dangerous in the 1990s: interest rates.
In 1991, the interest rate on 10-year Government of Canada bonds was more than 11 per cent. As a result, the cost of servicing federal government debt – of making the interest payments annually – was a whopping 6 per cent of GDP. In the mid-1990s, Ottawa was spending more than 30 cents out of every dollar it collected in revenue just to pay the interest on its debt.
Today, with 10-year bonds at just 1.25 per cent, federal debt-servicing costs are a shade more than 1 per cent of GDP. The interest on government debt consumes just 7 per cent of the budget.
Many economists argue that such low g borrowing costs not only make deficits and debt easier to bear – they may even make them desirable. This could be the best time in history for governments to borrow to finance long-overdue infrastructure projects.
“This is a very good time to do infrastructure spending. It’s not just the short-term interest rates that are really low, but the long-term interest rates are extraordinarily low. You can do a long-term project and you know you’re going to be locked into a very low-interest-rate environment,” says Queens University economist Don Drummond.
The other mitigating factor is that our debt-to-GDP ratio is manageable. Indeed, debt-to-GDP has emerged as the preferred benchmark. As long as the economy is growing enough, the conventional wisdom goes, we’re alright managing our debt.
Kevin Milligan calls it “the moral foundation” of debt economics.
“Should we be leaving debt to our kids?” the University of British Columbia economist asks. “The answer is ‘So long as debt-toGDP is going down, we’re not.’ ” The context is much different now than it was in the 1990s, Mr. Milligan says. Canada would need to add $800-billion of debt and see a quadrupling of interest rates to be back to the crisis of those years, he adds.
That’s not to say that there isn’t merit in maintaining fiscal discipline. Runaway deficits are to be avoided, Mr. Milligan says. And he acknowledges there’s a danger that Canada’s future governments will move the goalposts further out so that a stagnant debt-toGDP ratio might be deemed acceptable, or even increases would be tolerated.
Deficits do matter, Mr. Milligan says. “You want to make sure that [the deficit] doesn’t get out of control. But we need to look around us at the environment we have and recognize that it’s not getting out of control.”
If you accept the notion that going into debt is fine, however, the next question is how much borrowing is okay. And the answer isn’t clear. Moody’s does not have a specific threshold it considers dangerous, for example. “One of the great failings among many of the economists in public finance is we’ve never nailed down what is an appropriate level of debt-to-GDP ratio,” Mr. Drummond says.
We’re spending to buy votes, not promote growth The 2015 Liberal platform promised short-term deficits that would primarily be used to pay for increased spending on infrastructure.
“Now is the time to invest,” the party promised. Yet, in government, the Liberals struggled to meet their own infrastructure spending targets. Government-wide program spending still rose though, to $330-billion last year – a nearly $50-billion spike from the year the Liberals came to power. The size of the public service grew 12 per cent during that time.
For 2019, the Liberals and the Conservatives are both promising across-the-board tax cuts that would reduce federal revenues by about $6-billion a year. The Conservative campaign followed that up with a long list of more targeted tax cuts aimed at seniors, parents, homeowners and others. The Liberals are also targeting the same groups with promises of new tax breaks and benefits.
Neither party has so far announced major new infrastructure spending, although large long-term spending increases on infrastructure are already part of federal spending plans approved in recent Liberal budgets. The Liberal platform promises $56.9-billion in new spending and tax cuts over four years, to be paid for with $25.4-billion in tax increases and spending cuts as well as $31.5billion in new debt resulting from larger-than-planned deficits. The Conservative platform has not been released, but the party says it can cut taxes and still balance the books within five years.
The question is whether any of the spending will build the economy, improve productivity and create the conditions for robust growth.
Former deputy finance minister Scott Clark says deficit spending can be justified if it is a true “investment” that produces long-term benefits, such as spending on infrastructure or education. Yet, he’s been struck by the speed, volume and size of the Liberal and Conservative campaign promises, and says they do not fit that bill.
“These are just attempts to buy people off,” he says. “I don’t think of tax cuts as investments.”
Queens’ Mr. Drummond shares the view that deficit spending should benefit the younger Canadians who will inherit that debt.
“You still, at a minimum, have to justify passing on a burden to a future generation: Are you generating a benefit?” he says.
Cutting now could cost us more later When people talk about investing in things that pay off for the economy and generate economic growth, they often mention hard infrastructure such as roads and ports. But economist Jesse Hajer of the University of Manitoba says the notion of “social infrastructure” is just as important if not more so. By that he means investing in reducing poverty, in things such as enabling the latent potential work force in Canada.
He gives the example of Manitoba’s Indigenous community, which has been socially and economically excluded and underrepresented in postsecondary training and work. Helping them integrate into the work force is a good thing to go into debt for, he says. They are investments that pay off in the long run.
The bottom line is that it’s dangerous to look at deficits in purely ideological terms. Borrowing is not inherently evil, he says.
You have to look at what you get for the spending.
If governments are going to reduce the deficit, they either have to raise taxes or cut social programs. And those who advocate for a lower deficit typically reject tax increases, he says.
“So it’s programs that get cut.” Mr. Hajer says. “And there’s very little discussion about what are the costs associated with taking that programming away. Like what are the secondary impacts on the economy of people not having access to affordable childcare or people experiencing a diminishing quality of education?” “It’s a false narrative that you’re saving money by cutting these services,” he adds.
Marguerite Mendell, an economist at Concordia University in Montreal, says the context underpinning how we think about deficits has also shifted. Ottawa is no longer fighting high inflation or unemployment – or both at once. So, the government can make more careful choices about where it spends.
“The question one has to ask is what are they spending on?” Ms. Mendell says. “And if you’re going to engage in public spending for public purpose, I have no problem with that.” This is not what Keynes had in mind The legendary British economist, John Maynard Keynes, believed governments should use spending to lean against the highs and lows of the business cycle, thus smoothing the bumpy economic path. Although this Keynesian approach to fiscal policy has had its critics over the years, it is generally at the foundation of sound government budgeting the world over.
The idea is that when the economy is slumping or in recession, governments should increase spending, even if that means more borrowing and deepening deficits, to stimulate economic activity. When the economy is strong, governments can ease off the spending throttle.
The proposals from the leading contenders in this campaign appear to fly in the face of Keynesian logic. Both the incumbent Liberals and, to a slightly lesser extent, the Conservatives, look prepared to maintain or even expand deficits in the near term, at a time when the Canadian economy is running near full capacity.
Critics worry that deficit spending now will use up valuable fiscal ammunition that could be needed to aid the economy in a downturn.
The enviable fiscal health restored by Ottawa in the 1990s gave the Harper government the flexibility it needed for major stimulus spending in the financial crisis and Great Recession of 2008-09. Canada emerged without the kind of troubling debt load that saddled other countries who went into the recession with less healthy balance sheets, allowing it to avoid harsh austerity measures that hampered the recovery in other parts of the world.
Even if the government felt it couldn’t afford a major stimulus effort when the next recession hits – a decision that would certainly deepen the damage and slow the recovery – economists say that deficits would balloon regardless. Tax revenues would go down as the economy slowed, while expenses would increase in support programs such as unemployment benefits.
“You can move from a $20-billion deficit to $50-billion in a flash,” former finance minister Mr. Oliver says.
If we don’t learn from the past, we’re doomed to repeat history When Jean Chrétien’s Liberals took power in 1993, they inherited a country awash in red ink. The federal government had run a then-record deficit of $39-billion the previous fiscal year. Net federal debt was closing in on 70 per cent of GDP, about double where it was just a decade earlier (and more than double where it is today).
The budget that year, tabled by the previous Mulroney government, had a smattering of spending cuts, yet they barely kept up with debt costs. Simply paying interest on the debt was costing the government nearly $40-billion a year and climbing. Those costs alone ensured that the debt kept rising, making the problem worse every year.
Mr. Chrétien and his finance minister, Paul Martin, determined that it was time for tougher medicine.
“The debt and deficit are not inventions of ideology. They are facts of arithmetic.
The quicksand of compound interest is real,” Mr. Martin said in his speech presenting the 1995 budget – a radical document that laid the groundwork for the most dramatic financial transformation in modern Canadian history.
They set about a sweeping restructuring and downsizing of the federal government.
They slashed program spending by 13 per cent. They reduced the civil service by 55,000 jobs. They cut transfers to the provinces by 30 per cent.
Within four years, the deficit had been eliminated. The success at the federal level spilled over to the provinces, where budget balancing became all the rage during the 2000s. By 2005-06, every province in the country ran a small surplus.
Some observers, such as the Fraser Institute research group, see Canada in danger of repeating the mistakes of the past.
The high government spending and runaway deficits that led to the near-crisis of the mid-1990s are both present today, with warning lights flashing red, the research group says. Canadians, it says, should be worried.
The difference now is that declining labour-force participation is a big headwind to economic growth and government finances while our politicians don’t want to talk about debt. As Mr. Oliver puts it: “It’s tougher to sell prudence than it is to sell goodies.”
Federal government spending a person, adjusted for inflation, increased to a projected $8,804 this year from $7,740 in 2014, according to according to Fraser Institute economists Tegan Hill and Jake Fuss. In 2018, per-person inflation-adjusted spending reached its highest point in Canadian history, the institute says.
“Could small budget deficits turn into bigger deficits in an environment of fiscal complacency? Yes, easily,” says Kevin Page, head of the Institute of Fiscal Studies and Democracy at the University of Ottawa. “We should always be nervous of repeating the bad days.”

Full text: ARCHITECTURE
You can’t miss it. The sixstorey building is the tallest thing on its north-side Chicago block, and it grabs your eye with colour: dashes of purple, blue, red, turquoise, orange and a limey green run across its aluminum façade.
The architecture is proud, and also public. The building’s base holds the Independence Branch of the city’s public library, and the residences upstairs are run by the Chicago Housing Authority. That mix is unusual in North America, and the structure makes an argument for thoughtful and beautiful public architecture.
“Many public buildings don’t have dignity,” said the lead architect, John Ronan, as we walked through the library recently.
“Here, the finishes aren’t fancy, but the space is grand. You feel important when you walk in.”
That noble idea is actually borne out in the design. The work of Ronan, a decorated local architect, and his firm, it is coherent, subtle, friendly and beautifully detailed. The library is largely one open room, two storeys tall and (as advertised) grand. Windows onto the street allow visibility and gentle north light. A few pieces of expensive furniture in the children’s area contribute to the sense of quality. A set of bleacher stairs, accented with rainbow cushions, climbs up to the main stacks area on the second level.
The materials are indeed cheap, but well handled. The poured concrete that makes up the structure is imprinted with a pattern of small vertical stripes that feel great under the fingers.
And upstairs, the stacks are interspersed with tables where you can do your homework or, if you are retired, find a good read.
There are a lot of people who do just that, including the people who live upstairs. The 44 apartments, which are a mix of subsidized and market-rate, include residents who have a variety of needs, but treat the library as their living room.
Such a social mix is known as co-location. It makes a lot of sense: Programming for older people is a standby for public libraries, including the Chicago Public Library, and retired people can fill a library with life during the school day. On my visit, I saw both caregivers with little kids and elders hanging out alongside each other.
The architecture of the building is designed to bring them together, Ronan said. A back terrace on the second floor – next to the library – is available for use by the residents, and the librarians can open its doors for the odd story time or public event. “This is a way to bring together people who might not encounter each other otherwise,” Ronan explained.
Meanwhile, upstairs, the apartments are simple but attractive. A mix of one and two bedrooms are each generously sized, designed for full physical accessibility and filled with light. Each has a balcony, whose walls and doors are painted with a single bright colour that shows up on the street façade. Its internal door is also the same colour. This makes it easy to find your way home, even if your eyesight or your memory isn’t what it used to be. It also personalizes the place. “People can look up and say, ‘the red one - that’s my home,’ ” Ronan said. ”These are homes and not housing.”
That suggests some of the political significance of this building. In a city whose massive public-housing projects were notorious – and also targets of antigovernment and racist rhetoric – making something nice, and public, is a statement in itself.
This owes something to former Chicago mayor Rahm Emanuel.
Emanuel became a deeply controversial figure on the left, and last year he declined to run for re-election. But he did make a public commitment to design, and the Independence library is one of three housing/library blends that he leaves behind. They are “Rahm’s pet projects,” as Ronan acknowledged to me, and were built with friendly co-operation from city officials.
So they may not be easily reproduced. Certainly in Canada, the real estate deal that helped build the Independence project, involving private developer Evergreen and various public funding sources that don’t have Canadian equivalents, wouldn’t be possible right now. “We had many tools in our toolkit, and we used all of them,” David Block of Evergreen explained. (A unit of CIBC was an investor in the project, too.)
But this sort of thinking outside the box – bridging public agencies and public objectives to make good places – is incredibly valuable. One city in Canada has recently done a similar job with its Strathcona Library, opened in 2017, which combines housing run by the YWCA with a new library designed by DIALOG.
We need more urban places such as these, not only for what they do, but what they symbolize.
“Affordable housing now, in expensive cities, is going to be for all of us,” Ronan said. “If you can create a good example of affordable housing, that’s the job of architects – to change people’s perception of what affordable housing is.”
Such design can make the world better, and show us what a better world could look like.

Seattle developers look to woo spurned vancouver investors: Builders hope overseas buyers will look further south for real estate

Full text: An American developer is looking to attract the international buyers who would have previously looked to Vancouver.
“There are a lot of international buyers that were buying in Vancouver until they couldn’t really do it any more, so we want to capture those buyers,” says long-time developer Bob Kagan, senior vice-president of Californiabased Laconia Development. “We want to capture that market.”
Mr. Kagan has been building in Seattle for more than three decades and his latest project there, in central Belltown, is a 41-storey condo project called Spire. The tower, which is near the landmark Space Needle, is being built in partnership with China’s biggest residential developer, Vanke.
Mr. Kagan will be in Vancouver in October and November to meet with Vancouver brokers from Nu Stream Realty, who will help him entice buyers to his project. About one-quarter of the building has sold since it launched in May. He’s not the only one looking to drum up buyers in Vancouver. Last weekend, Concord Pacific, which has a condo project in Seattle, was co-sponsor of a Vancouver event that billed itself “an in-depth understanding of top tier educational opportunities, future job market in Seattle and the Real Estate Boom!,” featuring expert speakers from Seattle, with seminars for Englishand Chinese-speaking attendees.
They see an opportunity in Vancouver buyers, now that the city’s housing market has slowed.
In May, 2017, Greater Vancouver detached house prices peaked at an average of $1.8-million and have been declining since. House prices on Vancouver’s tony west side – once popular with satellite families and foreign buyers – have fallen by 30 per cent since the peak. Experts say a host of taxes deliberately aimed at foreign and speculative buying activity are responsible for the slowdown, along with tighter mortgage rules.
Mr. Kagan says that as a result, he’s seeing more Vancouver developers in Seattle and basically, he’d like to beat them at their own game.
“They are all coming down here because your [market] is drying up and we are going to have to compete with them.
“And they come with buyers who’d otherwise like to buy in Vancouver, but for one reason or another they can’t, so they buy in Seattle.”
The Spire was originally going to be a rental tower, which has been the trend for years in Seattle.
But the developer switched to condos last year, pricing the units at US$1,200 a square foot.
“Everybody was doing rental,” Mr. Kagan says. “The condo market dried up around the recession and is just now coming back. In real estate timing is everything.
We call it the real estate casino – that’s really what it is.”
Vanke is a publicly traded company and Mr. Kagan says they are moving into markets outside of China.
“[Vanke] have been here [in the United States] for awhile, and what they do is provide capital to U.S. developers,” Mr. Kagan says, “and they form partnerships with developers like us and we do the work and split the profits.
“So they are doing it because they see the company’s future eventually [moving] out of China. They are in London, Singapore, the U.S., and they want to learn how it’s done here. The way to learn is through partnering with domestic builders like ourselves.” He says the arrangement includes direct sales to China. He is not concerned about Vanke’s ties to the Chinese government.
“We’re so used to it, it doesn’t bother us. But they are a private company and they are expected to make earnings for share, just like we do,” he says. “Their name in China is gold; they carry a big marketing punch in China. So they have taken some units to China and we have had some sales from them because of that.
They have sold a good number of units for us in Spire.
“Spire is three blocks away from Amazon’s world headquarters and the Chinese investors know that. That’s a big deal.”
Dean Jones left Vancouver 25 years ago to settle in Seattle, where he is president of Realogics Sotheby’s International. He has travelled to China to market Seattle properties to buyers. Mr. Jones says he has closely watched the transformation of Vancouver’s housing market in the past couple of decades.
“There’s a part of me that regrets leaving my hometown right at the flashpoint of the market,” Mr. Jones says, “but I now feel well-positioned – and I benefited from viewing those trends up north, that are following a similar trajectory here in the Seattle market just 20 years later.”
He says foreign nationals are arriving in the region for work, to send their kids to school or to invest in a secondary property.
“That’s just part of being a global citizen. If you have got a multientry visa program and you can afford it, why not pick up a place in the Seattle area? You can have a second home, or your fourth home or your 10th home,” Mr. Jones says. “It’s no different than what Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York and perhaps Vancouver has been for years – a great place to have a home and also portfolio diversification.”
Mr. Jones says every major developer from Vancouver is working in Seattle, as well as many Chinese and Hong Kong developers.
Concord Pacific, Westbank, Onni, Cressey, Bosa and others have all made their mark on Seattle, he says. Because the region suffers from some of the worst traffic congestion in North America, there is a huge push for urban density, to avoid commutes.
He says that Vancouver developers have an advantage because of their experience in building towers. “It seems like those who have it figured out are coming from experienced urban density markets, like Vancouver and Asia.
I would say we are working with more international developers than we are with local ones.”
The difference between Vancouver and Seattle is that Vancouver’s residential market has been largely driven by wealth; in Seattle, the majority of the market is driven by jobs. The tech industry is flourishing in Seattle because companies don’t pay a state tax, as they do in California, and housing costs are still lower. Mr. Kagan says those lower costs combined with a thriving jobs market makes it a less riskier investment than Vancouver, where wealth can come and go. The rental market especially benefits from a strong jobs economy.
Daryl Simpson, senior vicepresident of Bosa Properties, says his company is developing rental units in Seattle, along with other Canadian developers who are diversifying during Vancouver’s market slowdown. He agrees that Vancouver’s development frenzy has given them the know-how to do the same in Seattle.
“There are very few other places other than New York that have developed the sheer number of buildings we have developed in the last few decades, so the talent pool is quite deep in Vancouver and the number of projects is pretty significant,” he says. “The U.S. has incredibly good home builders, but in high-rise, whether condo or more affordable rental in an urban context, there is an experience in Vancouver that creates a culture of competency.”
And while Asian buyers who otherwise might have bought in Vancouver might be eyeing Seattle, he says they’re looking at other cities, too. Mr. Simpson says his company will stick with rental projects in the United States.
However, Bosa Development, which is a separate company, has built condos in Seattle.
“The reality is, there is opportunity there now,” Mr. Simpson says. “The rental market is incredibly strong.”
It’s easier to build rental in Seattle than Vancouver, he says, for a few reasons. The permit process is more straightforward and land economics make it more feasible in certain areas of Seattle. Those lower land costs combined with high local salaries make it worthwhile to build luxury rental.
“It’s far easier to live in Seattle and pay rent on a brand new luxury rental suite than Vancouver, because incomes are so much greater there.
“The average employee in the Amazon campus earns around US$120,000, and that is the average – so the math works out better,” he says.

Full text: DONE DEAL 10A Chauncey Ave., Toronto
ISLINGTON-CITY CENTRE WEST
Asking price: $1,599,900 Selling price: $1,600,000 Taxes: $5,157 (2018) Days on the market: 90 Listing agent: Mary Jo Vradis, Re/Max Hallmark Realty Ltd.
THE ACTION Agent Mary Jo Vradis spent months educating buyers on the environmental and energy-saving benefits of this new home on a 25-foot-by-187-foot lot. Though some shoppers said they were considering making offers when it was priced at $1.75million this spring and then at $1.6-million this summer, actual bids on paper only appeared just before it was due to be relisted in the fall.
“It was very common at the time we listed for homes in the $1.6- to $1.8-million [range] to be sitting for 60 to 90 days or longer, especially since the stress test came into effect,” Ms. Vradis said.
“Because it was so unique in its features, everyone wanted to see what it would go for. When I took it off the market, we had three offers with a week.”
WHAT THEY GOT This 2,193-squarefoot house is one of two built side by side by builder Hauswork Ltd., incorporating sustainable finishes and energy-efficient technology, such as an energyrecovery ventilator system; doors and trims fabricated from recycled materials; and heated floors in the 854-square-foot basement.
For a modern look, large glass panes line the decks off two entertaining areas and the stairwell to three upper bedrooms, all of which have vaulted ceilings. A wall of flush-mounted cabinetry in the dining area also hides a wet bar and a powder room.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “Typically, homes built with these types of features are well over $2-million dollars and found in more exclusive neighbourhoods,” Ms. Vradis said.
“The builder is leading the pack in … showing, as a builder, you can build a visually pleasing, quality product while being mindful of your environmental impact, without it costing significantly more than a typical custom build.”
In fact, its green features will reduce utility costs and replacement of components, such as the metal roof, “which has a much longer life expectancy than a standard shingled roof, Ms. Vradis said. The builder, strenuous in his efforts to support local suppliers, sourced the roof panels from a Mennonite community in Fenelon Falls, Ont.

City passes police funding hike, renews call for handgun ban

Full text: Toronto’s council has voted to approve retroactively increased funding for police and to call once again on the federal government to ban handguns across the country.
The moves came during a debate about street crime, an issue that was brought to the fore in the city during a violent summer and one that has spilled onto the federal campaign trail.
Money approved Wednesday by council will be split between law enforcement and a new social program.
The bulk of it – $1.5-million – is earmarked for police, although this vote was a belated approval for police funding that began in the summer and will run out at the end of the month. Mayor John Tory had pushed for that funding during a period in which council wasn’t sitting, pledging to secure approval as soon as possible.
Another $300,000 is to lay the foundation for a social program providing targeted support for youth. The program will get off the ground next year only if money for it can be found in the 2020 budget or from other levels of government.
The funding votes came amid a series of motions, including expressing support for stricter bail conditions, and one from Councillor Joe Cressy calling on Ottawa to institute a full national ban on private ownership of handguns.
This is not the first time the city has called for this and it passed easily, although it is likely to receive a chilly reception. On Tuesday, mayors from across the GTA supported a national handgun ban while at an event with Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau.
However, he has resisted these calls. His party is promising instead to ban assault rifles, and look at working with municipalities to help them institute local handgun bans. And the federal Conservatives are opposed to any further firearm restrictions.
Wednesday’s crime-and-safety debate was set to begin in the late morning but was delayed by several hours after it became clear there were no senior police officers in the room to answer questions from councillors.
Deputy Chief James Ramer was eventually drafted in and the debate began. Over two hours, councillors weighed the best way to tackle street crime.
Frances Nunziata said that the parents of crime victims tell her they want a greater police presence. Gord Perks cited expert analysis to argue that more police is not the answer. Jim Karygiannis challenged police to explain why gun crime is rising in Toronto as it goes down in New York, although the latter city is still far more dangerous. And Kristyn Wong-Tam spoke approvingly about a blanket ban on all guns.
Also Wednesday, council unanimously endorsed declaring a climate emergency, without approving new funding to tackle it.
As part of next year’s budget process, though, staff will look for various ways to advance climatechange initiatives.
Before the meeting, Mr. Tory unveiled a climate-change plan he called the Green Will Initiative.
This brings together city officials with major commercial landlords, local universities and schools boards to see how they can make their buildings more efficient.
According to the mayor, the initial participants represent 300 million square feet of real estate, which he called “a very substantial start.” He cited a June, 2019, city report, which said that 52 per cent of Toronto’s greenhouse gas emissions in 2017 were from buildings. “Cities can and must make a difference in this great challenge,” the mayor said.

Full text: The path to victory in the October federal election lies in the suburban stretches outside of Toronto, a fast-growing and culturally diverse region of 30 or so ridings that make or break governments.
The 905, known for its area code, is a vast geographical area, where strip malls and homogeneous homes mingle with mansions, mosques, farmers’ fields and cricket stadiums, where driving long distances is a daily reality, towns are expanding and real estate prices are rising.
And it’s where elections are won and lost. People in the ridings, from Burlington in the southwest to Brampton in the northwest to Whitby in the east to Newmarket in the north, tend to vote in a block and swing between parties. The seats are among the most electorally important in the country and, so far during this campaign, many voters say they are feeling unsure.
The 905 was key to Stephen Harper’s majority victory in 2011, and Justin Trudeau’s in 2015, when the Liberals won all but a handful of seats in the region. In fact, in every election but one since Pierre Trudeau became prime minister, the suburban ridings surrounding Toronto have voted for the party that formed government.
The ridings are seen as the quintessential target for “middle-class” issues, with parties pitching messages about affordability tailor-made to the region, said Nik Nanos, who leads the team that conducts daily tracking polls for The Globe and Mail and CTV.
The Liberals’ success in the 905 in 2015 was “one of their key foundational pieces to forming a majority government,” Mr. Nanos said. Fast-forward to the second week of the campaign, “that advantage has been basically eliminated, where the 905 is much more competitive between them and the Conservatives.”
“The 905 belt is in play and is the one most likely to swing, and the most vulnerable to vote splits,” he said.
Both the Liberal and Conservative leaders face unique challenges in this election.
For Mr. Trudeau, it’s a series of broken promises and controversies, including the SNC-Lavalin affair and recent revelations that he wore brownface and blackface at least three times, as recently as 2001. For Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer, it’s a lack of profile and the Liberals’ constant comparison to cuts undertaken by Ontario’s Progressive Conservative Premier Doug Ford, a strategy that appears to be taking hold at the doorsteps. At Mr. Scheer’s campaign event in Whitby on Monday, parents showed up to protest the Ford government’s changes to the autism program. For his part, Mr. Scheer has taken to attacking former Liberal premier Kathleen Wynne’s economic record in Ontario when asked about Mr. Ford.
Mr. Scheer is expected to get some help this week: Alberta Premier Jason Kenney is planning to spend the weekend in North Toronto and the city’s suburbs, embarking on a whistlestop tour, although likely without the federal Conservative Leader, who campaigned in Toronto and the 905 on Monday. As immigration minister in the former Harper government for five years, Mr. Kenney worked to convince immigrant voters that the federal Conservative Party best reflected their values.
“Confusing,” said Jan Larkin, 64, as she stood in the parking lot of a small grocery store in Milton, a sprawling suburb northwest of Toronto. The riding is currently held by Conservative Lisa Raitt, one of the only Tories who survived the red wave that swept the 905 in the past election.
Ms. Larkin said she has traditionally voted for Ms. Raitt, but she’s eyeing Liberal Adam van Koeverden, the 37-year-old former Olympic kayaker, who is running for the first time. The problem, Ms. Larkin says, is the leadership of both parties.
“Trudeau – a lot of people might have swept the SNC-Lavalin scandal under the carpet, but I’m not one of them. And his ethics really concern me. I haven’t made up my mind,” Ms. Larkin said.
And what does she think of Mr. Scheer? “Boring. And I can’t help but stop and pause about the Doug Ford-Andrew Scheer connection. … Personally I think Ford might have some undue influence on the man. Perception is reality.”
The former IT professional, who lost her job a few years ago, said she cares about both low taxes as well as the environment.
She said Mr. Trudeau’s blackface incidents will affect her vote as well. She was “disgusted.” She said it wasn’t the act itself that disturbed her – because she says young people do stupid things – but what she saw as “a lack of sincerity” in his apology. “To me, he’s arrogant,” she said.
Still, she views her choice as a two-way race, ruling out the NDP and Greens – and adding she does not support the People’s Party of Canada. “I’m not going to waste a vote on a party that really doesn’t have a chance to get in there and make a difference.”
The Conservatives have focused their campaign on affordability, a pledge with particular resonance in the Greater Toronto Area. Along with a “universal tax cut,” they’ve promised to remove GST from home heating, review the mortgage stress test for firsttime homebuyers and cancel the carbon tax. The Liberals have also proposed a series of pocketbook measures, from making the first $15,000 of income tax-free, interest-free loans of up to $40,000 to make homes more energy efficient, as well as measures to tackle gun violence – all while promising to protect the environment, which is a top issue for voters.
Milton is one of the only suburban seats the Conservatives held on to in the past federal election, with Ms. Raitt winning by less than 2,500 votes. The city’s population, now around 125,000 people, is fast-changing, diverse and getting younger, having grown 30 per cent between 2011 and 2016, according to the census.
The recruitment of Mr. van Koeverden, who originally hails from nearby Oakville and now lives in Milton, means the Liberals view the seat as competitive, even in the face of a well-known incumbent.
“I don’t like doing things halfassed and I don’t like easy things,” Mr. van Koeverden, who has won four Olympic medals at four games, said.
“I was very comfortable asking myself ‘Why not me?’ when I was an athlete.”
Mr. van Koeverden and his gaggle of volunteers have been knocking on doors since October. Jogging up the front steps of a tidy house in a subdivision in Milton’s south end, Mr. van Koeverden, sporting his official Olympic jacket, hands over a flyer and introduces himself.
The man at the door, a father of twin sons in high school, shakes his hand. He tells Mr. van Koeverden, unprompted: “I have support for you. I don’t like Doug Ford.”
“So many people have problems with health care and education,” he adds.
The sentiment is echoed in other 905 ridings. Outside of an entertainment plaza in Mississauga, Nadeem Chaudry, 56, a security guard who hails from Pakistan, said he, too, worries about the Ford government’s handling of the education file, with the province potentially losing thousands of teachers owing to larger class sizes and heated negotiations between teachers’ unions and the Ford government under way.
“That’s the reason I’m still with the Liberals, in spite of all these scandals,” the father of three said. “I cannot afford a government like Ford.”
He said he personally wasn’t affronted by Mr. Trudeau’s racist makeup, and is still planning to vote Liberal.
“If he said ‘I’m sorry, it’s a bad act’ … I can accept that,” he said.
Sandra Jones, 57, of Mississauga, said the Conservatives’ promise to tackle the country’s deficit is important.
“The only one I see that is going to do anything is Scheer,” she said.
Heading into her fourth campaign, Ms. Raitt said the constant referencing of Mr. Ford during the campaign means people are talking about him, but it’s not nearly as negative at the doors as it was in 2015, when Mr. Harper was still leader of her party. She believes those bringing up Mr. Ford likely wouldn’t vote Conservative anyway and said more people are making up their minds.
“They are fed up,” she said.
“I’m getting more and more people shaking their heads, and saying we’ve got to get rid of this guy [Trudeau].”
As for Mr. van Koeverden, she said, “He has to tell everybody he’s a gold medal Olympian … and people know who I am.”
A recent Nanos poll, albeit with a small sample size, put the Liberals and Conservatives neck and neck in the 905 – with support falling for Mr. Trudeau’s party in the second week of the campaign. The poll was sponsored by The Globe and Mail and CTV. Mr. Nanos, who is tracking races throughout the campaign, says Milton is one of the closest in the GTA. Others include the north Toronto areas of Markham-Unionville and King-Vaughan, currently held by the Liberals, as well as Whitby, the riding once held by late finance minister Jim Flaherty and where former Liberal-turned-independent Celina Caesar-Chavannes is no longer running.
In Brampton North, 29-yearold Conservative candidate Arpan Khanna, a former adviser to Mr. Kenney, is looking to defeat Liberal Ruby Sahota, first elected in 2015. The Alberta Premier attended one of Mr. Khanna’s fundraisers in the spring, as well as another in Mississauga, and three of Mr. Kenney’s ministers have also travelled to British Columbia, Quebec and Ontario to campaign for the federal Conservatives.
“He does resonate well in this area,” Mr. Khanna, the son of immigrants from Punjab, said of Mr. Kenney.
The Liberals won all five seats in the Brampton area in the past election, where a majority of residents are visible minorities, primarily of South Asian descent.
The NDP is also targeting four seats in Brampton, an area where Leader Jagmeet Singh was a provincial representative before running federally.
Federal Conservatives believe they can win back many ridings they lost in 2015, including in Vaughan, where Mr. Scheer held his first Ontario rally in early September.
Attending the rally with her husband and infant son, Nancy Nasser el Ddine, 30, said low taxes are the most important issue to her young family, who reside in Woodbridge. She said her family sold its truck because gas prices had gone too high.
“The carbon tax is huge for me. That’s like a deal breaker,” she said.
“I think that the environment is really important. I don’t think that’s the most effective way to tackle [climate change].”
Other voters are looking to new alternatives. Rene Harris, 38, a customer-service agent who recently moved to Milton with his young family, considers himself a Liberal. But he said he is growing increasingly disillusioned with promises that are intended to make life easier for the middle class, with no direct impact on his life. Still, he said he doesn’t trust the Conservatives to lower taxes without sacrifices.
“It might be the best thing for us to give a different party an opportunity, like the Green Party.
Because [global warming] is an actual issue that is happening, not just here, but around the world,” he said.
“All the empty promises that we’ve received over the years, I don’t know what we could do any more, except to go a different route.”
Back on his door-knocking route, Mr. van Koeverden walks toward another house in the subdivision. A man sitting on his front porch tells Mr. van Koeverden not to come any closer.
“You’re the wrong person to come right now, man,” said Chris Louro, 42. “It’s nothing toward you. Your leader needs to go.”
Mr. Louro, who works in the oil industry, said Mr. Trudeau has done “a lousy job” over the past four years. “He’s made our country look like a bunch of fools,” he said.
He’ll be voting Conservative, he later says, but he doesn’t think the party will form government.
“I don’t think Andrew Scheer’s got of enough of Ontario to win the election,” he said.
If anything, he hopes Mr. Trudeau wins a Liberal minority.
“That way he doesn’t have complete control,” he said. “At least he’ll have to fight.”

Full text: The Liberal Party is calling on two oversight authorities in Saskatchewan to investigate Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer's claim that he was an insurance agent even though he was never licensed for the job.
The Liberals took aim at Mr. Scheer after The Globe and Mail reported Saturday it could find no evidence of the licence required by law to be an insurance agent.
In official biographies (such as the one on his Facebook page), Mr. Scheer is said to have been an insurance broker before entering public life. His office said he was an insurance agent. He was not.
"The Saskatchewan Insurance Act clearly states a broker must be licensed, and that misrepresenting oneself as a licensed broker is a serious offence that could lead to serious penalties," reads a letter from Ontario Liberal candidate Marco Mendicino to the Financial and Consumer Affairs Authority of Saskatchewan and the Insurance Councils of Saskatchewan.
When asked about his qualifications in Edmonton on Saturday, Mr. Scheer said he received accreditation through a broker program.
"As my staff mentioned to your newspaper, I left the insurance office before the licensing process was finalized," Mr. Scheer said.
Daniel Schow, a spokesman for Mr. Scheer, also told The Globe that Mr. Scheer did clerical work, such as issuing licence plates and collecting payments.
Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau declined to weigh in on the matter at a Sunday news conference in Mississauga. "I will let Andrew Scheer answer those questions," he said.
The letter is addressed to Roger Sobotkiewicz, a superintendent for the insurance and real estate division of the Financial and Consumer Affairs Authority, and Darryl McKay, chair of the Insurance Councils of Saskatchewan.
Attempts to contact both men on Sunday were unsuccessful.
The Conservative campaign had Sunday off, but spent Saturday in Edmonton with Alberta Premier Jason Kenney.
Mr. Kenney called the Conservative Leader "a man who is working hard to get our country back on track."
The federal Conservative Leader has yet to be seen on the campaign with Ontario Premier Doug Ford, however. When asked about not campaigning with Mr. Ford, Mr. Scheer said he is meeting with Canadians and Conservatives across the country who are "tired" of the Liberal government.
At the Edmonton event, Mr. Scheer reannounced his promise to build a national energy corridor. The Conservatives say its creation would create economic and social benefits by moving energy and resources, including oil, gas and hydroelectricity.
However, it's expected it would face stiff opposition from provinces such as Quebec, where Premier François Legault has said there is no "social acceptability" for a new oil pipeline.
The Conservatives also said they would appoint a panel to give recommendations within six months on how to proceed with the plan.
The latest daily tracking numbers from Nanos Research show the Liberals and Conservatives remain tied for first place, with the Conservatives at 34 per cent and the Liberals at 33 per cent - a divide that falls within the margin of error. The NDP and Green Party sit at 13 per cent, the Bloc Québécois is at 5 per cent and the People's Party of Canada is at 2.
The poll was sponsored by The Globe and Mail and CTV, with a total of 1,200 Canadians surveyed from Sept. 26 to 28. It has a margin of error of 2.8 percentage points, 19 times out of 20. Respondents were asked: "If a federal election were held today, could you please rank your top two current local voting preferences?" A report on the results, questions and methodology for this and all surveys can be found at tgam.ca/ election-polls.
NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh spent the weekend campaigning in British Columbia, where he said his party would spend $100million to help keep young people out of gangs.
He also highlighted his party's pledge to deliver on fighting climate change and tackling affordability, and he met with poet Rupi Kaur.
British Columbians have been let down long enough, Mr. Singh said.
"B.C. families are struggling to afford a place to live and pay for the medicine they need and when they told Justin Trudeau they wanted action to fight the climate crisis, he bought a pipeline instead," Mr. Singh said in a news release.
Green Party Leader Elizabeth May campaigned on Vancouver Island on Saturday and in Vancouver on Sunday.
