Full text: When the creators of SimCity were designing their virtual world, they realized they couldn’t depict metropolises accurately: There would have to be so many parking lots the game wouldn’t be fun.
In real-life cities, the pandemic shone new light on these acres of urban land, leading many places to start using the space in more valuable ways. Meanwhile, a growing push for sustainability had already prompted fresh thinking around the vast swaths of land dedicated to car storage.
At an arena in Montreal, children now play in an area that had been used for parking. Several parking lots in Winnipeg have been turned into popular beer gardens. A wooden mid-rise building is being planned to replace a parking lot in downtown Toronto, where space for 37 vehicles is destined to become 100 rental apartments.
But this trend has progressed haltingly at times, where grand goals have fallen victim to local pushback.
Vancouver’s plan to charge more to park the most polluting vehicles, part of the city’s response to climate change, failed by a narrow vote at council last October. Regina recently approved yet another downtown parking lot. Calgary announced plans to prevent residents of most large buildings from obtaining on-street parking permits, but has recently backtracked in the face of local opposition and instead will require fees of up to $150 a year. And Toronto appears set to retain most street parking in the redesign of Kensington Market, a downtown neighbourhood that attracts huge numbers of pedestrians.
However, the broader pattern is a gradual dismantling of the decades-long assumption that more parking is inherently better.
In 2020, Edmonton became the first Canadian city to remove minimum parking requirements on developments. These rules, which force developers to include set amounts of parking, are based in pseudo-science rather than rigorous standards, said academic Donald Shoup, author of the seminal book The High Cost of Free Parking.
More than a dozen Canadian cities have followed suit, removing parking minimums in at least part of their area, according to research by the advocacy group Strong Towns.
Perhaps the biggest recent shift in attitudes around parking has been the recognition of just how much value may be forgone by using desirable urban real estate as car storage. After Toronto allowed some on-street parking spaces on main roads to be used as patios during the pandemic, an analysis suggested that this generated far more revenue than in their original use.
Researchers for an association of local business improvement areas estimated that customers spent $181-million in the repurposed parking spaces in the summer of 2021. The same spaces would have generated $3.7-million in parking revenue, according to the local parking authority, and even that modest figure assumed prepandemic levels of demand.
“Curbsides have long been one of the most important spaces in cities, and at the same time in many cities they’ve been somewhat of an afterthought, and there’s been kind of just this default of using them for parking,” said Alex Engel, spokesman for NACTO, an association of urban transportation officials that counts several Canadian cities as members.
Parking in residential areas tends to earn even less.
In Vancouver, only in the city’s west end is the price of a parking permit being allowed to rise to market rate – with current permit holders spared the increase.
In other areas, an annual residential parking pass works out to as little as 14 cents a day. And in much of the city, no permit is required.
“New York City is perhaps the poster child for this, with large areas with very high-density, mixed-use land use but free onstreet parking,” said Paul Barter, a consultant and founder of the blog and podcast Reinventing Parking.
“People scream blue murder: ‘You’re stealing our precious parking spaces.’ The irony is, those ‘precious spaces’ are free of charge. If they’re so damn precious, why are they free?” Making public space available for far less than the equivalent real estate cost in expensive cities creates perverse incentives: For most residents it is much cheaper to fill their garage with stuff and leave the car on the street than to rent a storage unit.
And the unrealized value of a parking space can also be measured in less financial ways.
An April council vote in Toronto approving the wooden mid-rise building’s apartments at that downtown parking lot – more than half of which will be affordable – was part of a broader push to turn parking into entertainment venues, parks and cultural sites.
“Parking continues to play a purpose but not as it did in the 1950s, and so now’s the chance to think about other city-building objectives,” said former councillor Joe Cressy, who represented the area at the time of the vote.
“The core piece here is determining what is the biggest value for the city, in terms of its assets.
And affordable housing and sustainability is a bigger value than parking.”
That same evolution of thinking has been playing out in Regina – at least in theory. Restaurants were allowed to put patios in the curb lane to help them weather the pandemic. Minimum parking requirements are waived for development downtown, where the city hopes to encourage density and boost anemic population growth.
But parking remains sacred for many on the Regina council. At the end of last month, the council voted to explore requiring more parking for some types of development. And earlier in September, council approved without debate a bylaw amendment allowing yet another parking lot downtown, where nearly half of the private land is used already as parking.
“It still feels like we’re doing 1950s planning,” said Vanessa Mathews, an associate professor in the department of geography and environmental studies at the University of Regina. “You end up with streets that are made up mostly of parking that don’t add any kind of vibrancy or interest.
It’s certainly not sustainable.”

A Prince Edward County home with a Leave it to Beaver vibe: House has a dual life, as a well-maintained farmhouse at the front and an ultramodern look at the back

Full text: 38 Consecon St.
WELLINGTON, ONT.
Asking Price: $2,200,000 Taxes: $1,808.75 (2022) Lot Size: 81.99 by 280 feet Agent: Rob Plomer, Chestnut Park Real Estate Ltd.
THE BACKSTORY It’s often said that building a custom home or doing a major property renovation can be a stress test of your finances, your character and your relationships. It can also result in a home that reflects the owner’s tastes and mirror their life experience.
Where some people turn to Pinterest for inspiration, Evan Nash filled his home in the tiny unincorporated community of Wellington, Ont., (in the southwest corner of Prince Edward County) with influences from his personal travels and with elements from local artisans and suppliers.
Mr. Nash likes to say he grew up with Prince Edward County (PEC), which over his 37 years of life has transformed from a sleepy rural shire to a hotbed of viniculture and culinary experimentation. On the outside, his white-shaker-shingle-clad home superficially resembles many of the other clapboard houses in the community of about 2,000 people but inside it is full of architecture and design ideas that would not be out of place in a more urban setting.
“I love design and understand concepts of higher-end design, but I’ve also been the guy digging the holes and tarring the foundation. I grew up in a hardware store; building things has always been innate to me,” says Mr. Nash. He has renovated several properties in PEC over the past decade, starting with the apartments above the hardware store his family has owned for 105 years. “My dad [a landscape architect by training] and I did that together. He’s been amazing at teaching me to do things that are not only fun but make me money.”
Mr. Nash is speaking from his office inside a converted bank vault connected to his Home Hardware store about a block away from his house. After travelling around the world in his twenties, Mr. Nash and his wife returned to PEC about 12 years ago with the idea that he would soon take over the store. Back then, getting on the property ladder was a little easier: his first house cost about $220,000. After renovations, he sold it for about double that amount and bought another house and sold that one for $1-million, and so on. “I’m probably 10 houses deep at this point,” he says. In 2019, he formed Farmhouse Studios with one of his good friends, Jay Pooley, a University of Toronto school of architecture instructor.
Though he does work for clients now, he doesn’t choose to live in neutral builderbasic homes even if he has an eye on selling them some day. “I do, as a rule, design the houses for ourselves, that’s where you’re going to get the best quality. … You’re not going to get that passion if you’re speccing for a random buyer,” he says. “For me, it’s a process of how can we, in an economical and pragmatic fashion, enhance and add on to the existing beauty of a home.”
THE HOUSE TODAY The street-side half of Mr. Nash’s home is almost entirely original – a 11/2-storey structure with a covered porch wrapping around one side. On the back he added a two-storey addition, a barn-shaped building that’s at a 90 degree angle to the main house giving it space for an attached garage and a full second floor above. From the backyard, filled with clever landscaping and a pool, the house looks ultra-modern; from the front it looks like a wellmaintained farmhouse.
From the front door you enter a preserved space where he kept the original trim wherever he could and refinished the hemlock hardwood floors. The ceiling is tongue-and-groove pine, stained not painted. A staircase heads straight upstairs from the entrance, on the left side is a formal sitting area with original fireplace, complete with an ornate cast-iron door.
Mr. Nash built his house pre-pandemic, but in today’s market this might more naturally become a home office.
On the left side is the family living room, with walkout to the glassed-in sleeping porch that wraps around to the front of the house. Connecting to this room via French doors is a playroom filled with toys, which sometimes tend to spill out the other entrance to the dining room space that is also the transition from the old building to the new.
On this half of the house the narrow strip hardwood is replaced by a broadplank engineered hardwood Mr. Nash sourced from a fellow PEC resident (whom he sold a fridge too, at the hardware store).
This back half of the house is the workhorse for the family and Mr. Nash aimed to evoke a mid-century modern feel with wooden slats to help designate spaces while still letting outside light through.
The walnut upper cabinetry pulls more wood into this space, which is anchored by a huge island in with blue cabinets topped with quartz that waterfalls to the floors.
“I’m innately drawn to mid-century design, but it’s a hard thing to execute properly,” Mr. Nash said. His one regret is that mixing new and old meant there’s a lot of different materials in the house – at least nine different types of wood – unlike most mid-century designs that tried to keep the materials list shorter. “Mid-century was really good at reacting to the site, when you have an existing building it’s hard to create, but I’m on the right track, every time you do one you get closer.”
Art deco-inspired tiles mark the mudroom opposite the kitchen (partially hidden by pantry storage) that connects the side entrance (in a two-storey light well), garage entrance and rear pool-deck exit to the powder room here (handy for wet kiddos zipping in from the pool).
There’s a second staircase (with iron railings from his neighbour, a metal fabricator) that opens into the kitchen that leads up to the addition’s living spaces. The break between the new and old is even starker here because there’s a bridge spanning the atrium that separates the old house from the addition’s three bedrooms.
The half-floor above the old house hosts a somewhat unusual U-shaped bedroom that wraps around the rough-cut studs (left exposed for some rustic rawness) that frame in the stairwell. The two kids’ bedrooms (one with its own slide!) in the addition are next to each other, and there’s a climbing wall and secret tunnel at the top of the spaces that connects them. Mr. Nash’s daughter chose the floral mural wallpaper in her room, and his son picked the llama wallpaper that comes another PEC local, Kate Golding.
A hallway lined with rear-facing windows and a glass-railed balcony that looks out onto the pool and entertaining area transitions into the primary bedroom suite. A large walk-in closet anchors the space, with ensuite bathroom (black and white marble-slab walls with hexagonal shower tile) to the right and a modest sleeping space to the left.
‘CHEEKY BEERS’ Mr. Nash admits he was a demanding client to Wentworth Landscaping in the backyard. “I dug the pool myself – I was trying to save money,” he said.
Then, the pool was closed for a year and a half while he built the main house before Wentworth was called back to finish. “It was the third summer when I really got to enjoy the pool space. We have 25 people who come for swimming, it’s become the neighbourhood hangout. The kids run freely between backyards – they have a secret bridge over the trees – it’s kinda Leave it to Beaver.”
The landscape, with bedrock close to the surface, helped mandate a clever way to define the space: the kitchen opens onto a patio and deck and yard that’s separated by fence from the pool deck that opens from the mudroom.
At the rear of the property, a raised deck with pergola is high enough so the back half is a bar surface for those hanging out in the barbecue area “This became the hideout where the adults sit while kids are swimming, there’s a fridge in case you want to have a cheeky beer,” Mr. Nash said.
“The smartest thing I ever did was get the outdoor pizza oven; it’s an easy thing to whip up pizzas on a Sunday afternoon and on Canada Day we have a pizza contest. We are so blessed in our neighbourhood, they are all super foodies, and all great cooks, they all show up and I get to judge.”
No surprise then that he’s planning on renovating another house a few doors away, which is also just a block from the hardware store that as he said, “has fed my family for 120 years.”

Full text: MARKET FORCES Well, that was fun wasn’t it? After two and a half years of coronavirus, war and surging-then-falling stock prices, we are now back to pretty much where we started.
In nominal terms, Canadian and U.S. stock prices hover roughly 10 per cent above where they stood on New Year’s Day, 2020, before plague, inflating prices and Vladimir Putin knocked the world for a loop.
Adjust for inflation and stocks are actually a hair cheaper in real terms than they were before this lunacy started.
One way to view this round trip is as a sign that the madness has been shaken out of the market and sanity has been restored after the excesses of the pandemic era.
There is a lot to be said for this happy view. When investors can collect dividend yields of around 6 per cent a year on blue-chip Canadian companies like BCE Inc., Bank of Nova Scotia and TC Energy Corp., it seems clear the market is offering some decent value.
But that may be missing an equally important point. While stocks certainly look a lot more reasonably valued than they did at the start of the year, their fall from the heights of giddiness doesn’t ensure they are now free of problems. Those problems include the lingering impact of the pandemic as well as the uncertain situation in Ukraine. The biggest issue of all, though, is rising interest rates.
Governments, corporations and households are struggling to adjust to a new regime. For more than a decade after the financial crisis, the smart thing to do for policy makers, executives and consumers was to take advantage of rock-bottom interest rates in a low inflation environment and load up on debt. Now, with inflation ripping and central banks competing to push up interest rates, taking on large amounts of debt is suddenly looking like a much riskier proposition.
The ramifications of this abrupt shift are just beginning to work their way through the system.
Rising mortgage rates in Canada and the United States have pushed real estate markets in both countries into the deep freeze. Soaring bond yields and better savings rates have put pressure on share prices by offering an increasingly enticing alternative to risky equities.
Meanwhile, surging U.S. interest rates have attracted a swarm of investors and helped to propel the U.S. dollar to a two-decade high against other major currencies.
The U.S dollar’s relentless rise puts enormous pressure on other countries to follow suit with rate hikes of their own. Otherwise, their currencies will cheapen even further against the greenback. And that would mean they would have pay even more in local-currency terms for goods and commodities priced in U.S. dollars.
This mass move to higher rates could have unintended consequences. Central banks “risk acting too forcefully,” Maurice Obstfeld, a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund, warned in a recent note. “By simultaneously raising interest rates, they amplify each other’s policy impact and, if this feedback loop isn’t taken into account, could drive the global economy into recession.”
In this uncertain environment, it takes a brave person to attempt to put a value on stocks.
Fortunately, Aswath Damodaran, a professor of finance at New York University and expert on valuation, rose to the challenge this week. He outlined the key variables in an enlightening blog post and arrived at a fair value estimate of 3,516 for the U.S.-focused S&P 500 – just slightly below its current level around 3,610.
This is somewhat reassuring, but Prof. Damodaran stresses that his estimate hinges on several unknowable factors – how badly corporate earnings will be hit by any future recession, how high interest rates will have to go and how much of a premium investors will demand to offset the risk of holding stocks. Nudge any of these factors just a bit and you arrive at very different estimates of fair value – some much higher, some much lower.
The key takeaway for investors may be that stocks are far cheaper than they were but are still not undeniably cheap. Look, for instance, at the ratio of stock prices to company revenues. In the U.S., this price-to-sales ratio has plunged from pandemic highs, but is still at one of its highest levels in the past 20 years.
In Canada, valuations appear more reasonable. The problem here is the economic picture is darkening.
One of the classic ways to assess the broad economic outlook is to look at the gap between short-term interest rates (as measured by the two-year government bond) and long-term rates (as measured by the 10-year government bond). Long-term interest rates are typically higher than short-term rates. When this pattern inverts, it usually indicates a period of economic weakness ahead.
Right now, the Canadian yield curve is steeply inverted. This does not bode well for corporate earnings or stock prices.
Long-term investors may decide to overlook these immediate problems and start nibbling on the values that have emerged after stocks’ plunge this year. But the key word there is nibbling.
Until interest rates stop rising, gorging does not seem like a great idea.

Full text: MISSISSAUGA Sometimes a building project can provoke fundamental questions about how we live and work. With Connecting Cooksville, a mixed-use development in Mississauga, there are two. One: How do we house the millions of people flowing into the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area? Two: How do we design a new place, amid car-oriented suburbs, that actually feels like a city?
Connecting Cooksville – led by SvN Architects for the developers TAS – serves up excellent answers to those questions. It suggests a dense, mixed-use neighbourhood with robust transit, organized around community facilities, public plazas and a lush little forest.
But whether this vision is going to get built is in question.
Let’s begin where the important things happen, at street level. Here, the development scheme proposes something very rare in suburban Canada: good quality public space. The site is two hectares at the corner of Hurontario and Hillcrest, major arteries through the city of Mississauga. “We want this project to be a model, by focusing on the public realm and public amenities,” says Sam Dufaux, design director at the architecture firm SvN.
The plan calls for five separate towers, all to the outer edges of the block. The designers have tried, as much as possible, to keep private cars and delivery vehicles out of this zone. Instead of streets, the centre of the block is drawn as a publicly accessible plaza for pedestrians, lined by shops, a new public library and a new public recreation centre.
This central idea – keep the cars out – is both obvious and radical. The urban design consensus in Canadian municipalities often calls for a focus on public streets as the zones of public life. The problem is that when the streets are roaring eight-lane traffic sewers, as is the case with Hurontario, nobody will take pleasure in walking there or sitting with a cappuccino.
The SvN design follows through on this insight with rigorous execution. About 90 per cent of the buildings’ ground floors will have public or commercial activity, including small shops set aside for local entrepreneurs. Thus these open spaces will be “activated,” to use planning jargon, by people walking and rolling through them.
Many of those people will be heading to the adjacent GO Transit Cooksville station, to and from the future LRT line on Hurontario Street, or from the existing MiWay buses on nearby Dundas Street.
This provides a rare opportunity to deliver a place that is actually pleasant to explore without a car. That is vanishingly, shockingly rare among large suburban developments in Canada, where the ground level is typically dominated by cars and halfbaked public space.
The developers are serious about that goal of delivering a 15-minute city, where all daily amenities are at hand, says Mazyar Mortazavi, chief executive officer of TAS. “We have to look at the ground plane as an amenity for the community,” he says, “and that includes those living within the new buildings and those around them.”
The landscape architecture here is also notable: It promises to be forest with a diversity of species and a real, functioning ecosystem. Mark Thomann, a landscape architect with the prominent American firm WHY Architecture, explains the plantings will emulate the kind of ecosystem that would exist here if it was not, at the moment, a giant parking lot. “Think of all the reasons people want to go out into a forest,” he says, “for contact with nature, for learning, for relaxation. How could all that cycle happen in an urban development where you’re watching that forest grow?” In short, this design promises many unusual things. If TAS delivers – or comes close – the result could be a new neighbourhood of remarkable design quality, a place where people can live, shop, hang out beneath some poplars and catch a train to work.
However, there are challenges.
The project now relies on tall buildings between 34 and 46 storeys, which allow TAS to make its financial return while leaving lots of open space. But Mississauga city policy (in the form of recently passed official plan amendments) limits building heights to 30 storeys. To meet that limit, the development team will need to make the towers shorter and squatter and their bases chunkier. This would certainly produce a worse result for both residents and visitors.
Why is the city set on that policy? Mississauga is focusing its downtown two kilometres from here at Square One mall, which has been a centre of high-rise growth since the eighties. In that zone – which is near a major highway, with mediocre transit – the city allows unlimited heights.
But at Cooksville, residents are much more likely to take transit. The Ontario government recently introduced a new policy that sets density targets around Major Transit Station Areas such as the Cooksville GO Station.
The city says, basically, it doesn’t need taller buildings here to meet the province’s mandate. “The proposed building heights [in city plans] can easily accommodate the city and region’s planned density target,” spokesperson Irene McCutcheon said, noting that their target is double the specific provincial requirement.
But why does the city only want a bare minimum of development that’s relatively green?
Mr. Dufaux and his colleagues at SvN are outspoken advocates for climate action, and he makes a strong argument that density – including right here – is the right policy move. “Ontario could grow by four million people by 2043,” he says, citing a recent projection by Statistics Canada, “and where are they going to go?” Combine that with Canada’s commitment to cut emissions to net zero by 2050, he says, “and intensification is the only way.
We need very big change.”
These are statements of fact.
People simply need to live closer together and drive less, relying much more on mass transit. Yet this insight is not reflected in the policies of Ontario, which continue to direct much of the growth in the Toronto region to its suburban edges and beyond.
And it is not reflected in local policies in cities such as Toronto, or Mississauga. “There is a real disconnect between our highlevel goals as a society,” Mr. Dufaux says, “and the regulations that govern what we actually build.”
For instance: parking regulations. For now, the Cooksville project is being designed with five levels of underground parking to meet city policies.
Of course, Mr. Dufaux is talking up his project. But the arguments are unimpeachable: Fastgrowing Ontario needs to build a lot of housing for a lot of people, near mass transit. Most of it is not going to be this liveable or this beautiful. Hopefully Mississauga will focus its efforts on getting all of the Cooksville project’s promised public amenities, and insisting on all that beautiful design with more people and less parking.

Full text: David Eby, who served as B.C.’s housing minister until he resigned his post in July to run for the New Democratic Party leadership, is promising sweeping changes to provincial housing policy, including measures to increase housing density in communities zoned for single family homes.
Mr. Eby, who is viewed as the front-runner to replace Premier John Horgan when NDP members vote in December, released his housing proposals on Wednesday as the first plank in his leadership platform.
The plan would curb the regulatory powers of local governments and strata councils, where zoning and bylaws limit housing stock, and create a new “flipping tax” that would apply to the sale of residential properties that are resold within two years.
It would also increase spending on housing developments that target middle-class renters and homebuyers. That would include $500-million in capital funding to allow non-profits to purchase rental buildings listed for sale, to protect existing renters. In addition, the plan would focus on creating new Indigenous housing, both on and off reserve.
Mr. Eby, who also served as B.C.’s attorney-general until this summer, vowed to tackle “frauds, cheats and criminals” by increasing policing powers to investigate suspicious real estate transactions.
“I’m really proud of the work I did as housing minister during the pandemic,” he told reporters at his leadership platform announcement – the first such event he has held since entering the race. “But we know it’s not good enough.”
The B.C. NDP government came to power in 2017, promising a range of policies to increase housing affordability, including a rebate for renters that was never implemented.
While some new housing units have been built, the cost of housing has skyrocketed and rental vacancies are close to zero in many communities. Statistics Canada data released on Wednesday shows B.C.’s population has increased by more than 115,000 over the past year – growth that Mr. Eby noted has made the housing market even tighter.
Mr. Eby’s proposals would force municipalities to allow greater density. Homebuilders in major urban centres would be allowed to replace a single family home with up to three units on the same footprint, as long as they are consistent with existing setbacks and height requirements. As well, secondary suites would be made legal in every region of the province.
While those measures could pit the province against local governments, it also may take the pressure off some municipal councils that have struggled with community battles over density.
The city of Victoria has spent at least three years pushing changes to allow single family homes to be rezoned for higher density, but council recently voted to put the decision off until after the Oct. 15 municipal elections.
“Every local government in British Columbia recognizes that we are in a housing crisis. And so we are excited to see this platform,” Jen Ford, president of the Union of B.C. Municipalities, said in an interview. But she cautioned that some of the proposed measures that would limit local government authority will require more assessment.
“This government has shown a real commitment to respecting the autonomy of local governments and working together, and our members have been requesting that that partnership be strengthened and respected,” she said.
Under Mr. Eby’s proposals, strata councils would no longer be able to ban rentals. Mr. Eby would also abolish age restrictions in some stratas that prohibit those under 19, although restrictions for seniors-only buildings would remain in place.
Peter Milobar, the Liberal opposition critic for finance, questioned why Mr. Eby didn’t act on his proposals when he was housing minister. “It looks massive and bold. But in reality, we were told in 2017 that the NDP had a bold housing plan, that he helped preside over as housing minister and at the cabinet table. What we saw in that time is only seven per cent delivered.”
The Liberals say the NDP’s promises on housing affordability have been a failure: The NDP promised 114,000 new units, including rental, social, co-op and owner-purchased, when first elected, but less than 8,000 units have been created. Their promised rebate for renters has not materialized and just during Mr. Eby’s two-year stint as housing minister, the average cost of a one-bedroom apartment rose by $511 per month, to $2,412.
Mr. Horgan is stepping down after leading the NDP through two election victories. Mr. Eby, long regarded as Mr. Horgan’s heir apparent, has the backing of a large majority of the caucus. He is currently the only approved candidate.
Climate activist Anjali Appadurai is seeking approval to run but is being investigated by the party for potentially breaching its election rules.

Multi-unit buildings across the country: Whether its a duplex, triplex or more, these properties help pay off the mortgage

Full text: MONTREAL 4378-4384 Rue de Bordeaux Asking price: $1,275,000 In some of the most popular neighbourhoods in Montreal practically every block is filled with ‘plexes: duplexes, triplexes, fourplexes, you name it. In the Plateau neighbourhood the telltale exterior stairs to a second or third level are often a clue if a building is subdivided, but that isn’t to say it’s all renters.
“If you’re going to buy a triplex and live in one of the units, it will help to cover your mortgage and expenses. The bank will grant you a bigger mortgage amount if you have rental revenue,” said Geneviève Borduas, broker with Les Immeubles M W Inc., who has several listings for ‘plexes around Montreal. There are also pure rental investors who recognize the right ‘plex can be a great return on capital. “It tends to be cheaper to buy a triplex versus buying three condo apartments,” Ms. Borduas said.
There are four apartments in the Rue de Bordeaux building, which is your standard threestorey on a street that’s chock-ablock with similar style buildings.
On the main level are two recently renovated a one-bedroom apartments; on both the second floor and third floor there are stand-alone three-bedroom apartments. Ms. Borduas’s listing said the annual rent revenues for the building are above $65,000, which could more than cover mortgage bills depending on the size of the loan.
There’s often interest from buyers looking to convert a ‘plex into a single-family home in Montreal’s once working-class but now increasingly affluent downtown neighbourhoods, though Quebec’s strong tenant protections can make it easier to add new units than to take them away. That’s what happened here, the previous owner spent money on roof and foundation fixes and subdivided the main floor so the two smallest apartments are now earning the most rent per square foot in the building.
TORONTO 39 Major St.
Asking price: $2,099,900 Toronto is a mixed bag for those looking at investing in smallscale rental ‘plexes: On the one hand rental rates in the city are soaring (up 25 per cent since 2021 for apartments according Rentals.ca). On the other hand, home prices are still stubbornly high even as rising interest rates makes it harder to borrow a lot of money cheaply.
“They were really easy to sell six to seven months ago,” said Toni Martens, with Re/Max Ultimate Realty Inc. “Now, with interest rates going up, that’s why some [investors] are the sidelines.” He’s been listing a Victorian row-house triplex (with a basement apartment) on Major Street – a block away from the University of Toronto’s western edge – since March, 2022. The current owner bought it for $1.5-million in 2018, and Mr. Martens initially listed it almost $250,000 higher than his current $2.099million asking price. Even though it has been renovated by the current owner, some of the tenants are paying below-market rent, which can be a deterrent for investors looking at ‘plexes in Toronto. “Long-term tenants with the low rent - nobody wants to touch it,” said Mr. Martens. “The cost to evict the tenants, it’s really high. Even if you offer $30,000, they won’t take it.”
The challenge is the capitalization rate: As interest rates rise, a potential investor either needs to invest more money into a down payment to keep the mortgage payments low enough for rents to create cashflow, or have a building with high enough rents to justify paying more. The bumping up of rental revenues by a few thousand dollars a month could mean posting hundreds of thousands less in down payment.
“One of the buyers we sold [another plex] to got dividends from a company he works for, plus part of an estate. They want to invest money on a safe place, not a stock market,” Mr. Martins said. “It was easy to sell because it was vacant: the new owner can paint the house and get market value rents.”
HALIFAX 1034 Bland St.
Asking price: $1,899,000 The house at 1034 Bland St., presents a unique prospect: the upper two levels are a huge five-bedroom home that’s been fully renovated and restored, while the completely remodeled half-basement holds three apartments with four bedrooms between them. Technically that’s a fourplex, but it’s also in a heritage protection zone, which does allow it to be converted to a six-plex (as the adjoining house is organized).
“It would be a shame to brick it up, but you are allowed to do that.
… I think the person that buys it will live upstairs, and have the rental income downstairs, which should pretty much pay all your expenses and taxes,” said listing agent Stephen Patterson of Parachute Realty.
The basement apartments are tenanted, and recently, pulling in more than $4,000 a month between two studios and a two-bedroom. “That’s crazy,” Mr. Patterson said. “It’s really tight in Nova Scotia for housing right now, it’s definitely a housing crunch. I think Dalhousie University is reporting 20-30 students still haven’t found housing.”
The building was renovated by a local developer who included some unique touches such as a fenced-in patio in the backyard accessible only to the upstairs five-bedroom house. The main living space was opened up so the kitchen and family room flow together and the living room/dining room fills the front half of the house. Mr. Patterson has fielded inquiries from both local rental investors to folks from away looking for flexibility. “I’ve got a doctor moving here from out west.
He might eventually have his parents move to the basement.”
It’s not exactly cheap at $2-million, but as Mr. Patterson puts it, if the rents pay for half the mortgage then it’s a real bargain to get an updated five-bedroom house in downtown Halifax for under $1-million.
EDMONTON 10746 (and 10748) 75 Ave. NW Asking price: $724,990 In 2019, Edmonton became one of the first cities in Canada to essentially do away with what’s known as exclusionary zoning when it allowed duplexes and semi-detached homes to be built on any existing single-family residential lot. That has allowed for a boom in duplexes and fourplexes across the city, particularly in the areas near the city’s core introducing loads of what’s called missingmiddle density (home types that sit between one-family per structure and a multi-storey residential towers).
Kristyn Rost of MaxWell Polaris sells homes for a select group of builders who are redeveloping homes to create some affordable options in this fashion. She has the listing for two nearly identical semi-detached homes with basement apartments in the Queen Alexandra area (near the University of Alberta and the city’s main drag, Whyte Avenue). The homes at 10746 and 10748 75 Ave. NW are two sides of one semi-detached structure and, aside from a few cosmetic touches – one favours a raw-lumber-style flooring, the other something a little more barn-board grey and muted, they have the same price and the same layout: The upstairs apartment is about 1,680 square feet with three bedrooms and 2½ bathrooms.
The basement apartment has two bedrooms in addition to kitchen, laundry and bathroom.
“For some people, it’s strictly for investment,” said Ms. Rost, she’s recently sold ‘plexes to investors from Ontario and British Columbia. But she also sees a lot of locals who see it as a way into the housing market. “Professionals who want to have the option to rent out the basement suite,” for example, she said.
Unfortunately, the new frontier in zoning has also opened up a bit of a wild west in terms of builders without qualifications throwing up homes. “It’s such an unregulated industry,” Ms. Rost said. “Where it comes to home warranties; it’s garbage, they don’t follow through on anything. Homes are being turned over in really crummy condition.”
That’s why she’s careful about who she works with. “These guys, the ones I choose to work with, they do good work … for me I need to feel good about what I’m selling to somebody. I know these guys will make it right.” VANCOUVER 2756 Point Grey Rd.
Asking price: $3,980,000 Vancouver has some of the most expensive land in Canada, so it’s not surprising that in some highly sought-after areas a duplex often times isn’t so much a rental property as way to find a slightly more affordable home.
That’s very true of this duplex on the desirable Point Grey Road section of Kitsilano, where, as listing agent Allie Lau put it, you can “be part of multi-billionaire living.”
Indeed, on the north side of Point Grey Road there are homes on the water that sell between $10- and $20-million. Ms. Lau’s listing is on the south side, across the street from an oceanfront park, though it does have a million dollar view from the second and third floors looking across Burrard Inlet to the mountains on the north shore.
It has a garage off the laneway, the kitchen and living room on the second level to maximize those views, with three bedrooms on the third floor. The primary bedroom faces the water, and there’s a roof-deck access here as well.
“Mainly [buyers] like the location; it’s on the ‘Golden Mile’ a lot of people want to live in Point Grey,” she said. The house has been on the market for more than 180 days, and last sold in 2016 for $2.8-million, but so far the threelevel home has deterred buyers of a certain age. “Lots of buyers are older, for them, too many steps,” Ms. Lau said.

Soaring arches above a rural retreat: Hockley Valley home design blends barn and medieval cathedral, with wooden structural supports and century-old salvaged beams

Full text: 3030 Concession Rd. 3 A DJ A L A -TOSORONTIO, ONT Asking Price: $5,499,000 Taxes: $13,585.15 (2022) Lot Size: 68 acres (268.28 by 3,215 feet) Agent: Johane Lefrançois, broker, Johnston & Daniel Division, Royal LePage Real Estate Services Ltd.
THE BACKSTORY Over the space of 20 years, John Pennie went from wanting to build a wind farm, to building a house with a concert hall, before ultimately planting a vineyard and building a winery on his Hockley Valley estate north of Toronto.
The 68-acre plot was a farm and a gravel pit when he purchased it more than 20 years ago, and at 1,000 feet above sea level seemed like a decent spot to place some wind turbines for his former company Windrush Energy.
“After testing the wind we discovered the wind was not as strong as out in the Grand Valley area,” he said, and the company placed three green energy projects in that area over the next 15 years. With no plans for energy in Hockley Valley, he suggested to his partners that the land might make for a stellar home, one that he wanted to design himself.
In the mid-1980s Mr. Pennie built a Tudor-style home in Caledon, Ont., inspired by the scenery near the Windrush River in the Cotswolds region of England. Choosing the highest point on the Hockley Valley lands he was determined to build something that could function as an entertainment space and showpiece; thus Windrush Chateau was conceived, finishing in 2003.
The almost 11,000-square-foot building is like a hybrid of a barn and a medieval cathedral, with its cross-shaped structure and a gambrel roofs. Inside all the wooden structural supports in the ceiling are exposed, as are dozens of century-old beams salvaged from Ontario barns. “Some people say this looks like the inside of a Viking ship; upside down of course,” Mr. Pennie said.
Mr. Pennie’s wife, Marilyn Field, is a musician and music teacher who started the Darearts Foundation charity, which touched the lives of thousands of children over its more than 20 years of operation.
The need to hold investor meetings for his business and fundraisers for her charity led to quite a number of concerts and dinners held inside the huge structure.
“We can sit 60 people for dinner in the great hall or 100 for a concert,” Mr. Pennie said . Over the years they have hosted intimate concerts for local music festivals, been used as a studio for streaming performances during COVID and raised a lot of money. Where Mr. Pennie once chipped in with prep work for these events, at 83 he’s finding himself with less energy and motivation to put out 100 chairs for guests.
“I found I need to make a change in our lifestyle,” he said.
THE HOUSE TODAY As the laneway winds toward the main house the hillside falls away to the right and a thicket of trees shrouds the hilltop on the left.
The main entrance is on the end of one of the cross-pieces (called a transept in cathedral-speak) and the double doors open into an uninterrupted chamber that extends to a wall of windows on the opposite wing. Glass-railed stairs climb up on the left to the second-floor loft (and down to the lower level) next to an elevator, while a huge dining table dominates the central hall, which is open to the ceiling and those long-boat ceiling supports.
On the right is a long hallway that runs past a separate pantry/servery to the large eat-in-kitchen. Anchored by a large Ushaped island (“They can lay out 60 plates for plating,” Mr. Pennie said, “they” being chefs brought in for events, such as their friend J.P. Challet, formerly of the Windsor Arms and at Auberge du Pommier) that is surrounded by river-stone floors and backsplashes, the room has walls of windows on two sides flanking a stone-faced hearth.
A patio wraps around the kitchen connecting it to the pool deck outside (which is actually next to the front door, why is a long story involving zoning) and there’s more entertainment space and views commanding the heights of the north table of Hockley Valley.
Just off the dining room is Mr. Pennie’s office (complete with a boardroom table) and a main-floor primary bedroom suite with its own fireplace and more views of the valley. A short hallway past the stairs takes you to a guest bathroom and a second office for Ms. Fields.
Downstairs is a gym, garage access and what is currently set up as an office complete with cubicles but which could be a stand-alone apartment or in-law suite complete with its own full prep kitchen and window-wall walkout to the grounds.
Upstairs is where those soaring ceilings take centre stage.
This is the largest open space in the house, and from the top of the stairs there are two zones separated by a glass-railed walkway. On its own above the kitchen is a 32- by 40-foot studio space with grand piano that could host an entire brass band plus choir, which of course would fill the house with music.
On the other side of the hall is more living space, a sitting area acts as the foyer for two large bedroom suites, each with its own full bath. The room on the right has a staircase to a loft space above, the highest point in the building that looks out on everything.
A SEMI-PUBLIC PRIVATE ESTATE The couple has been hosting events at Windrush as part of their burgeoning wine business, but the only downside to the property is that while it comes with a fiveacre vineyard with about 6,000 plants, Mr. Pennie is taking the winery equipment with him. The couple is keeping the wine business, which they can do because they don’t use the grapes grown on the land.
“We have a vineyard here that’s too young to harvest for a premium wine,” Mr. Pennie said. The way it works in Ontario is you’re able to bring in outside grapes to make wine even if your grapes aren’t producing yet (Mr. Pennie estimates the current grapes are a few seasons away from maturity). That does mean that a buyer could someday set up their own winery in the vacated winery building, or convert it to a horse barn, or whatever they desire.
The concerts and fundraisers; acres of trails and bush; the vineyard and winery; Mr. Pennie hopes someone who buys the property wants to keep up or build on the estate’s role in the community. “We [built] it for ourselves and our friends and charitable purposes,” he said. “We’d be happy if somebody bought it and wanted to have a hybrid lifestyle.”

Why couldn’t the Holidome, a one-stop vacation destination, keep up with the times?: The iconic ‘Fun Domes’ flourished until the early 1980s. Today they’re mostly a memory

Full text: Remember the Holidome?
They were hotels with enclosed courtyards and massive, indoor recreation centres that included tropical-themed décor, kidney-shaped pools, mini-golf, billiard tables, tiki bars, table tennis and shuffleboard.
In the 1970s, Holiday Inn built a number of these leisure-oriented hotels marketed toward families but with amenities that would appeal to grown-ups as well as kids – early versions of fun palaces similar to the Great Wolf Lodge Water Park Resort model in Niagara Falls, Ont.
The concept flourished until the early 1980s and spawned nonHoliday Inn imitators in Canada, such as the Wheels Inn in Chatham, Ont., eventually replaced with a convention centre in 2011.
Today, Holidomes are mostly a memory and very few are left standing. They have either been rebranded or renovated and bear only a faint resemblance to the stately pleasure domes of the leisure-suit and disco era.
“The idea of these leisure properties more or less peaked during the era of the traditional family, a mother and father and the kids,” says James McKellar, professor of real estate and infrastructure at York University’s Schulich School of Business in Toronto.
“The demographics have moved on. Households are smaller, there are a lot more elderly people and there are a lot more single people,” Dr. McKellar says.
“They were originally called ‘Fun Domes,’ ” says Ross Walton, writer and historian for the University of Southern Mississippi’s Center for Oral History and Cultural Heritage. ”Holiday Inns started in 1952. They had a policy that every 20 years the properties [which were franchised] had to be either renovated or somehow renewed.”
The solution was simple. “A lot of the franchise owners had Ushaped buildings with a pool in the middle, and two partners in Kansas City who had Holiday Inns, Robert Brock and Edwin Linquist, came up with the idea of enclosing the courtyard,” Mr. Walton says.
“[Holidomes] came at a perfect time for the hotel industry, during the energy crisis,” he adds. Fuel prices shot up dramatically after the Arab oil embargo of 1973 and during the Iranian revolution of 1979.
“There were fuel shortages, and people who wanted a getaway had to stay closer to home,” Mr. Walton says.
Holidomes flourished not only because they offered escape but also because the idea was consistent with the Holiday Inn brand, Mr. Walton adds.
The idea was the self-contained vacation. “You could stop at a Holiday Inn at that time and do everything – they had hairdressers, restaurants, gas stations, so indoor entertainment made sense too,” he says.
“Leisure travel now is much more global. At one time you’d get in your car to go somewhere, but then we saw the rise of discount airlines and packages, and people started to travel farther afield,” Dr.
McKellar says.
People still want to hop in their cars and enjoy a little fantasy fun on their road trips, but their tastes have evolved since the Holidome days, says John Belknap, co-owner of Penny’s Motel in Thornbury, Ont.
He and his partners renovated the 13-room motel to offer escape amenities that might appeal more to 21st-century tastes – an extensive wine list, an oyster bar and an open-air courtyard where guests are encouraged to mingle by an open fire.
“We could have put a swimming pool in the courtyard, but why? We’re just a few steps from Georgian Bay, and the amenities we want people to enjoy are the ones in the area – swimming and boating in the summer and skiing in the winter,” Mr. Belknap says.
His co-owner Drew Sinclair, who is also principal of SvN Architects + Planners in Toronto, says that Holidomes were also victims of rising maintenance costs.
At many Holidomes, the humidity from the indoor pools would damage the domed ceiling and make the inner-courtyardfacing rooms damp and stuffy, he explains.
“While the maintenance of these domed structures is really costly, they’re very easy to demolish, and you still can keep the hotel,” Mr. Sinclair explains.
Insuring Holidomes also became more and more costly, Mr. Walton adds, and the Holiday Inn chain started to rethink its marketing after changes in corporate ownership and a failed hostile takeover bid in the 1980s by a developer named Donald Trump.
The local pleasure escape idea is still going strong, but it’s different now.
“There are places like Great Wolf Lodge,” Mr. Sinclair says.
“They focus on one type of activity – in their case, swimming – and they’re near other tourist attractions.”
Amusement getaways are more connected to shopping now than to overnight stays, says Jane Domenico, senior vice-president and national lead, retail services at Colliers Canada.
“Holidomes look like they were great in their time,” she says. “People still want fun and games, just not necessarily at a domed roadside hotel.”
Increasingly, people are going to malls with indoor amusements to get their kicks, rather than hotels with domed indoor recreation centres.
“There are malls with entertainment and amusements in Quebec City, Toronto, Cambridge, Ontario and West Edmonton Mall [which includes the Fantasyland Hotel],” she says.
“And of course, there’s Las Vegas.”

Full text: Canada’s housing market is in retreat, but in some provinces there’s an emerging niche where demand for home loans is still booming: Halal financing for Muslim homebuyers.
More than a million Canadians identify as Muslim, but they are disproportionately renters and many have felt shut out of the country’s real-estate market. That is because practising Muslims are prohibited by their faith from paying or receiving interest, which prevents them from taking conventional mortgages.
In Edmonton, a new startup, Canadian Halal Financial Corp., is trying to meet some of the demand for home ownership in Alberta’s Muslim community. The company was founded by Thomas Lukaszuk, a former provincial MLA and cabinet minister, and John Stainton, a businessman and lawyer.
The two have worked closely with the Al Rashid Mosque, a local mainstay, to create an alternate type of mortgage they say meets strict religious standards. The company has approved 600 applications since its launch last December, with more than a dozen new requests coming in each week.
“This is the fastest growing segment of the Canadian population that was excluded from Canada’s real-estate market,” Mr. Lukaszuk said. “It’s extremely, personally, very rewarding. But it took a lot of effort.”
Islamic finance isn’t new, but it exists in a fragmented patchwork across the country and has yet to enter the financial mainstream.
Many providers of halal mortgages are concentrated in Ontario, and some have operated in a religious grey zone without much oversight or a consistent set of standards, unlike the halal food industry, which is tightly regulated.
Canadian Halal Financial positions itself as a credible provider of mortgages that comply with Islamic principles on the authority of two fatwas – a form of religious edict – from respected Muslim authorities. That includes one from a committee at Al Rashid, Canada’s oldest mosque and a prominent hub in Edmonton.
One of the mosque’s leaders, Imam Mahmoud Omar, travelled to Egypt and to get approval from scholars at Al Azhar University, one of the world’s oldest sources of Islamic jurisprudence. The fatwa that Al Azhar granted to Canadian Halal Financial is the first for a North American company.
Yet it took years of discussions, and six-figure legal bills, to reach that point, responding to pressure from the mosque’s congregation about the need for a halal way to buy a home in Alberta.
“They approached the Imams, they said … ‘we cannot rent forever, so find us a solution,’” Mr. Omar said in an interview.
At first, leaders at Al Rashid had discussions with credit unions and banks locally. But those institutions concluded that they couldn’t create a compliant product and keep it separate from their core business lending and taking deposits based on interest, Mr. Lukaszuk and Mr. Omar said. As a result, they wouldn’t be considered halal.
The Al Rashid mosque then turned to Mr. Lukaszuk, who had done business building new homes after he left politics, where he met Muslim clients looking for a way to finance new construction. It took two years of meetings with lawyers and scholars to draft contracts that complied both with provincial and Islamic laws.
And there were times when Mr. Lukaszuk thought it “would be impossible.”
When the company launched, “it was a big hit and big news,” Mr. Omar said.
“Imagine that when someone is renting for the past 20 years and it’s like, finally, you guys made it possible for me to own my house.
It was an emotional time.”
The company offers two types of halal financing. Both require a down payment of at least 25 per cent, regular payments until the home is fully paid for and charge a fee over and above the price of the home that is not based on interest rates.
“It is okay from a religious perspective for us to make a profit, but this profit cannot be interestbased,” Mr. Lukaszuk said.
By far the most popular type of contract is musharakah, a form of partnership similar to a lease-toown structure. The buyer’s name is on the title to the home, the amortization period can be up to 30 years and there is flexibility to make early lump-sum payments.
Also available is a more traditional murabaha contract, which has a shorter term up to 15 years and payments that are locked in.
One buyer, Nadeem Rahman, came to Canada in 1998, and lived in and around the Greater Toronto Area for the next 14 years. In 2006, he bought a home through a now-defunct halal financing company that didn’t last, and sold it before he moved to Edmonton in 2012. He had been renting ever since, until he found Canadian Halal Financial through the Al Rashid mosque, which has a program to sign up prospective clients.
With financing from the company, Mr. Rahman bought a larger home in Edmonton where he lives with his wife, daughter and son, with room for extended family to visit. After property taxes, it costs about the same as the smaller town home he was previously renting, he said. He likened having a mortgage from a company recognized by his mosque and Al Azhar to having a prescription signed by a doctor.
“I can take this medicine,” he said. “It takes the burden away from us. It gives a very big and strong confidence going with them. … It’s just like a big door opened for a lot of people.”
The structures of Islamic financing sometimes walk a fine line. Canadian Halal Financial’s contracts can only have two parties – the company and the buyer, with no involvement from other financial institutions or insurers.
The company cannot mix its funds with interest-bearing products, but it can raise capital or take credit lines to fund its business from financial institutions, including banks, pension funds or private wealth funds.
“We are the buffer and there is no direct contact between our investors,” Mr. Lukaszuk said.
The question each time a new Islamic finance provider launches in Canada is, “Are they halal or not?” said Dr. Mohamad Sawwaf, founder and chief executive officer of Toronto-based Islamic financial institution Manzil, who has a doctorate in Islamic finance.
His company follows standards set by the Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Financial Institutions, a Bahrainbased non-profit. It sets rules about structuring products and governance that require a company to have an expert supervisory board, internal and external auditors, and regularly updated certifications or fatwas.
“This can be done in the right way,” Dr. Sawwaf said.
Strong and consistent standards will be critical as demand for halal mortgages grows in Canada, and more financing providers start up to meet that need.
Canadian Halal Financial is fielding an increasing number of inquiries from outside Alberta, and the company is considering opening offices in Ontario, B.C.
and Quebec in the near term.
At Manzil in Toronto, the waiting list has 12,000 families who want financing to buy homes and the company would need another $6-billion in funding to serve them all.
“We have a mismatch when it comes to supply and demand,” the Manzil CEO said.

The making of Pierre Poilievre: The Conservative Leader has preached small government since his teenage years. Now people are embracing the message – and the messenger

Full text: At a lunchtime campaign stop in the town of Fergus, Ont., in April, the lineup to see Pierre Poilievre wound around the hallways of a recreation centre.
Two nights earlier, his downtown Toronto rally finished with hundreds standing in a serpentine line for 90 minutes, waiting to take a picture with him. Many hadn’t been to a political event before.
It’s a scene replicated in towns and cities across the country, with a cross-section of traditional conservatives, trucker-convoy fans and 30somethings worried about home prices coming out in droves to see Mr. Poilievre.
What Mr. Poilievre offered to those crowds is his uncomplicated explanation of what has gone wrong.
It’s something he absorbed as a teenager and has preached ever since: Big government overreaches, taking away our personal choice, our economic freedom and our money. Now people are embracing the message - and the messenger.
They watched him command stages with a radio-announcer’s voice, a broad smile and a sense of his audience’s frustrations. He talked about teenagers depressed by lockdowns and an unvaccinated mom getting fired.
He told the crowd in Toronto about a couple in a trailer park near his home in Greely, who work in a quarry making materials for building houses, but calculate they’ll never afford one of their own.
“When the people who build our houses cannot afford to live in them, we have a fundamentally unjust economy, my friends,” he told his listeners.
The problem, he said is “big, bossy government” telling people what to do, and spending so much it caused inflation that clobbered ordinary folks.
He’s a proselytizer. Mr. Poilievre preaches small-government conservatism while digging both hands into the mucky trenches of partisan politics, ruthlessly pushing aside questioners as Liberal unbelievers. He has spent decades whittling free-market economist Milton Friedman into accessible phrases for main street.
There can be no doubt now that Mr. Poilievre has struck a chord with the Conservative Party base and beyond. He has become a social-media and viral-video personality. Hundreds of thousands signed up to back his leadership campaign, handing him a landslide first ballot victory.
At 43, the Alberta-raised MP is now Opposition Leader and, by Canadian political tradition, prime-minister-in-waiting. He takes the helm of the Conservatives as the Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, now seven years in power, faces angry veins of pandemic frustration and economic angst fuelled by wallet-stretching inflation.
Mr. Poilievre declined an interview request for this piece, and largely avoided sitting down with the media after he solidified front-runner status.
The Globe interviewed dozens of current and former colleagues, staff, associates and friends, although many were reticent to be named as it became clearer Mr. Poilievre would be the new Conservative leader.
He won the leadership by seizing the momentum of the so-called “freedom convoy” - with its motley mix of pandemic-measure protesters, vaccine opponents and conspiracy theorists - that rolled into Ottawa in January, garnering crowds and donations.
Mr. Poilievre railed against vaccine mandates, insisted the whole movement was not responsible for racist symbols or anti-government manifestos raised by some, and never called for the blockades to stop.
His critics have labelled him a Canadian Donald Trump, and he has mirrored populist MAGA techniques. He built a social-media following bashing Liberal “elites,” played peek-a-boo with conspiracy theorists, and avoided contradicting those who insisted the World Economic Forum is secretly running Canada. At rallies, ty his culture-war calls to defund the CBC won pe the loudest cheers. er But he is no Donald Trump in tenets or temperament. He doesn’t echo the anti- th immigrant rhetoric, and abhors Mr. bi Trump’s gargantuan deficits. He is so calculated that he could never be the erratic bun- fo dle of impulses that rambles at a Trump ralM ly.
Away from cameras, there is another Pierre Poilievre: A quieter, private, wonky bookworm with a nerdy laugh who seems m too affable to share a body with the political ad performer seen on YouTube demanding fi- co nance ministers give him yes-or-no an- w swers. D In his lifelong political education, he has learned to turn opposition into opportuni- sa y, to delight at progressives clutching earls while he grabs attention, and to nevr back away from fights.
His job now is converting those who feel hey’ve been struggling to the message that ig government is their burden.
That’s the mission he’s been practising or his whole life.
M r. Poilievre has repeated his origin story many times in recent weeks.
He was born to a 16-year-old unwed mother whose mother had just died, and dopted by two schoolteachers who had ome to Calgary from Saskatoon. In fact, when his birth mother had a second son, Donald and Marlene adopted Patrick too.
His family’s heritage, Mr. Poilievre has aid, is like Canada’s: “all mixed up.”
The Calgary kid was named Pierre because of Don’s franco-Saskatchewan heritage. Don’s grandfather, Joseph, had emigrated from France in 1904 to what would become Prud’homme, northeast of Saskatoon. Don’s father Paul farmed, ran a garage in Leoville, a hotel in Moose Jaw and settled into real estate in Saskatoon.
Marlene’s mother, Louise Schartner, had her daughter in rural Saskatchewan during the Depression, but separated from Marlene’s father only months later. His biological grandfather was an Irish immigrant from County Meath.
Don and Marlene married in 1971 and were older parents, on either side of 40, by the time they adopted Pierre in 1979.
Pierre’s parents were teachers through the rough recession of 1980s Alberta, and he described their standard of living, in the suburban southwest edge of Calgary on Shawnessy Drive, as modest. The boys could play hockey and go on camping trips.
Pierre played sports and was on the wrestling team, until a teenage shoulder tendinitis forced him to stop.
That injury opened a door. He was a bored teenager, he told The Globe and Mail in a 2015 interview. And as he watched his mother head to an Alberta Tory riding-association meeting, 14-year-old Pierre begged to tag along. He caught the bug. He threw himself into politics, and started reading books.
While still a teen, he found the book he has for 20 years described as his seminal influence: Milton Friedman’s Capitalism and Freedom. The book is Mr. Friedman’s argument that economic freedom is key to personal freedom, and that apart from limited cases where government action is needed for a greater neighbourhood good, government initiatives infringe on personal freedom.
Yet Mr. Poilievre’s biggest influence was surely participating in real-life politics, taking on adult roles as a teen. He went to meetings of both the Alberta Progressive Conservatives and federal Reform Party, knocked on doors in campaigns and served on a riding executive. A week after his 17th birthday, he was a delegate to Reform’s 1996 national convention in Vancouver. He did phone canvassing for a young Calgary Reformer running for the first time, future federal cabinet minister and Alberta Premier Jason Kenney.
But something apart from a shoulder injury was happening as he threw himself into politics: His parents separated. In his mid-teens, Pierre was shuffling between Shawnessy Drive and his father’s new home. Eventually, Don came out as a gay man.
In his Sept. 10 victory speech, Mr. Poilievre for the first time spoke of his father and his long-time partner’s relationship publicly as he acknowledged both of them in the audience.
In the mid-1990s, there were still few openly gay politicians and celebrities, and coming out came with more social vulnerability.
Shuvaloy Majumdar, a former Conservative staffer who met Mr. Poilievre when both were 18, said that among people Mr. Poilievre knew, his father’s sexuality was no secret.
“I’ve never seen him uncomfortable with his family. It was never something he hid or pretended didn’t exist or lied about,” Mr. Majumdar said. “It was always, ‘This is who I am. This is where I come from.’” sex partners, including in the Reform Party, with its wide vein of social conservatism, included homophobic warnings that such measures would promote homosexuality.
“[Pierre] never thought the rights of sexual minorities was icky. He was never repulsed by those things. I think he was trying to understand the decisions his father was making for himself,” Mr. Majumdar said.
Perhaps, he said, the dislocation of his parents separating encouraged him to find his identity in a political community.
In 2005, as a rookie MP, he gave a speech opposing gay marriage, arguing civil unions would ensure equal rights while preserving the traditional definition of marriage. In typical Poilievre style, he blamed the Liberals. Atypically, he declared deep respect for those who disagreed with his stand.
Fifteen years later, in 2020, he told La Presse that he’d learned a lot and realized gay marriage is “a success.” When erstwhile Conservative leadership candidate Richard Decarie called homosexuality a choice, Mr. Poilievre tweeted: “Being gay is NOT a choice. Being ignorant is.”
I f he was looking for his identity in conservative politics, Pierre Poilievre found himself in a hothouse at the University of Calgary in the 1990s.
A ‘Calgary school’ of political science professors was writing up a revival of free-market, individual-liberty politics, and student activists squabbled about the divide between the western-based Reform Party and centrist federal Progressive Conservatives.
At 19, Mr. Poilievre was already discovering opposition was an opportunity to get headlines. When the student union attempted to prevent campus Reformers from campaigning for their candidate in Alberta’s non-binding Senate election, Mr. Poilievre marched a protest across campus, through annoyed students in the food court, to the Goddess of Democracy statue, where reporters were waiting.
“Pierre, I think, discovered his natural talent,” Mr. Majumdar said.
Mr. Poilievre was among the Reformers on Alberta campuses pushing rock-ribbed, ideological conservatism, a group battling the federal PCs they derided as so politically flexible they lacked principles. Jeremy Harrison, now Saskatchewan’s Minister of Trade, but then a University of Alberta Reform activist, said they had a firm view about how to do it: “Never backing away from fights.”
The 2022 shots Mr. Poilievre’s leadership campaign took at former Quebec Premier Jean Charest for being a Liberal should come as no surprise. That’s pretty much how Alberta student Reformers like him saw Mr. Charest when he was Progressive Conservative leader in the 1990s.
Some of their fights were directly with then-PC youth leader Patrick Brown, the erstwhile leadership candidate Mr. Poilievre repeatedly called a “liar.”
The “pre-Brylcreem Pierre,” a skinny kid in T-shirt, flannel, and jeans studying poli-sci, could be found with his nose in Milton Friedman’s Monetary History of the United States. But the debate-club, modelUN student wasn’t shy about making speeches: Mr. Harrison still marvels at how he’d walk in front of a TV camera or into a gym to make a speech.
“The guy you see giving speeches right now is same guy that you would have seen giving speeches when he was 19 years old,” Mr. Harrison said. “It’s remarkable. Even the content. Phrasing. Pierre’s views have not really wavered.”
At 19, Mr. Poilievre penned an entry for an “As Prime Minister” essay contest whose content would fit his speeches today. He was rewarded as a finalist with a four-month internship at Magna, the contest’s organizer, in what remains as his longest stretch of employment outside politics.
I t was another internship that marked his political education, in a Reform Party program that blooded a remarkable generation of influential conservatives.
Reform leader Preston Manning asked senior aide Rick Anderson to launch an internship program for up-and-comers. The first iteration, in 1997, sent interns into Ontario on a school bus to knock on doors before the June election, “staying six to a room with cases of beer and pizza,” Mr. Anderson said.
Kory Teneycke, later prime minister Stephen Harper’s communications director and Ontario Premier Doug Ford’s election-campaign manager, ran the program. In the second year, he reorganized it based on the fellowship he’d done in Washington with the libertarian Charles Koch Foundation. Interns worked in MPs’ Parliament Hill offices doing research or correspondence, but also attended mandatory lectures.
There was bonding. Mr. Poilievre was the guy who asked the wonk question in lectures.
“I guess if you’d asked any of his cohort of interns who would have been most likely to run for prime minister one day, he would have got the most votes,” Mr. Teneycke said.
Of the perhaps 50 or 60 who participated in the program in its early years from 1997 to 2001, a remarkable number rose to become elected politicians and senior political staffers.
Mr. Poilievre, Mr. Harrison, and former leader Andrew Scheer all became MPs in their mid-twenties, in 2004. Mark Strahl and Shannon Stubbs were elected later. Ray Novak became Mr. Harper’s executive assistant, then chief of staff. Mr. Majumdar was senior policy adviser to former foreign affairs minister John Baird.
But one intern connection marked Mr. Poilievre’s life indelibly. Jenni Byrne, one of the first batch of Reform interns and later youth co-ordinator, became Mr. Poilievre’s friend, and the two struck up a decadelong romantic relationship that lasted until 2011.
She became Mr. Harper’s feared, take-no-prisoners fixer, deputy chief of staff and campaign manager, with a reputation, then and now, for ruthless tactics. Mr. Poilievre and Ms. Byrne are still friends, and she is effectively his chief strategist, guiding his leadership campaign and now working to make him prime minister.
Many of those early interns later crossed paths in junior staff jobs on Parliament Hill, and events of the Reform Party and its successor, the Canadian Alliance. Mr. Poilievre led a Calgary phone bank, dubbed Fight Club, for Stockwell Day’s Canadian Alliance leadership campaign.
In Calgary, he wrote a few op-eds with Mr. Day’s communications aide, Ezra Levant, now owner of right-wing site Rebel News. For a time, he had a side business with Jonathan Denis, later Alberta’s justice minister, doing robocalls for candidates.
In 2002, he left Calgary, leaving his degree unfinished for six years, to work for Mr. Day on Parliament Hill. One day, a group of junior staffers went to a meeting and were surprised by the topic: getting young Pierre Poilievre elected to Parliament.
In 2004, the Calgary kid had displayed enough ego to think he could get elected in the Ottawa-outskirts riding held by Liberal defence minister David Pratt.
To win the Conservative nomination, he knocked on doors at party members’ houses, looking like such a kid that local businessman Bill Ayyad, later his riding-association president, thought he was there to collect empty bottles.
According to two Conservative associates, Mr. Poilievre briefly thought about changing his name to Peter over concerns about his French name in semi-rural areas, but on Friday his office said this was not the case. Mr. Poilievre displayed a pavement-pounding work ethic - a career-long hallmark - and, representing the newly united Conservatives, he won.
The 25-year-old told The Globe he wasn’t nervous about Parliament.
“I know how the place works,” he said.
Scott Simms, then a new Liberal MP from Newfoundland, attended an orientation with Mr. Poilievre and realized that he was a cut above the other new MPs because he had studied the craft of political performance. “Pierre was like every successful politician of the ‘80s and ‘90s wrapped into one kid,” Mr. Simms said.
That often got missed because by anyone’s measure Mr. Poilievre was a sharp-tongued, overconfident rookie. “I think a lot of people who show disgust at Pierre Poilievre, there’s a streak of jealousy in it,” Mr. Simms said.
He had a nose for a winning issue, pressing the federal government to sell a local hospital its land for one dollar. And when the Conservatives took power, he was made parliamentary secretary to Treasury Board president John Baird, and apprentice to a politician seen as a partisan pitbull.
Prime minister Harper’s young, swaggering PMO aides were derisively dubbed the “boys in short pants,” and Mr. Poilievre was seen as the parliamentary model. Some Tories mocked him as “Peter Polliver.”
The acerbic Mr. Baird called him “Skippy.”
PIERRE, A16 He had a knack for peeving opponents. After he was accused of making an unparliamentary gesture in 2006, Liberal veteran Ralph Goodale huffed that “this little boy needs some potty training.”
It was, in the eyes of his friend, Alberta MP Michael Cooper, who stayed in Mr. Poilievre’s basement when he was a Conservative intern in 2006, an effort to brush him off: “But he was not someone to be dismissed.”
Off the political stage, Mr. Simms got to know the low-key, friendly Mr. Poilievre while doing presentations for a school exchange from their ridings, and making jokes. In Commons committees, he observed the performer, wincing when he beat up on non-partisan civil servants, but marvelling at his talent for tailoring a message to his target audience - and being willing to attack those who weren’t part of it.
In the minority Parliament, he was a “spear-catcher,” in Mr. Teneycke’s words. He gummed up opposition efforts to pursue the socalled in-and-out election-financing scandal in 2008 with dozens of points of order, and suggested Elections Canada officials were out to get the Tories. And in the Harper era, when backbench MPs were expected to say little and stick to the script, he wasn’t afraid of making waves in front of a microphone.
By his 29th birthday in 2008, he was a second-term MP making six figures. A lot of people wanted to see the cocky young politician screw up. And he did.
A s he rose in the Commons on June 12, 2008, Pierre Poilievre looked shell-shocked, gulping as he delivered “a full apology.”
The day before had been a landmark moment in Stephen Harper’s tenure. He had delivered a historic apology for residential schools.
Indigenous leaders filled the Commons galleries.
Then Mr. Poilievre stepped on the moment in a radio interview.
Mr. Harper’s apology, he told Ottawa radio host Steve Madely, came with $4-billion in compensation.
“Some of us are starting to ask, ‘Are we really getting value for all of this money, and is more money really going to solve the problem?’ My view is that we need to engender the values of hard work and independence and self-reliance.”
The next day, Mr. Harper dressed him down so sharply that people outside the room were embarrassed. Then Mr. Poilievre, a back-bench MP, was hauled into the cabinet’s prep session for Question Period to go over his part in the damage control, a pre-QP apology. His face was flushed, as if he’d brushed away tears. Ministers avoided Mr. Harper’s gaze.
Mr. Poilievre might have felt his political career was hanging by a thread.
For months afterward, with the 2008 election in between, he seemed more withdrawn, less aggressive, former colleagues said. Several said he learned a hard lesson to choose words deliberately. They differ on whether it taught him to be wiser or more clever. But he knew he had overreached.
Yet Mr. Poilievre had advocates in the PMO, Ms. Byrne not least, and according to Mr. Teneycke, Mr. Harper liked his fight.
The PM named him his parliamentary secretary - an appointment that was both promotion and penance. It meant he sometimes fielded more questions than cabinet ministers, constantly deflecting and defending awkward questions. “In that regard, it is a thankless job,” Mr. Cooper said. Mr. Poilievre privately admitted to some he hated it.
When he was named to cabinet as a junior minister just after his 34th birthday, it was his tactical political skills that were being mined.
His primary job as a junior minister responsible for democratic reform was pushing a controversial Fair Elections Act that among other things would restrict Elections Canada’s role in promoting voting to young people and Indigenous peoples. When the non-partisan chief electoral officer, Marc Mayrand complained, Mr. Poilievre retorted that he wanted more money and power.
What was unusual about Mr. Poilievre’s ministerial style was that he did so much himself. Even when he gained a full staff as a senior minister in 2015, he delegated tasks more than responsibility. He especially controlled the message. He wanted punchy, tabloid-style simplicity. He didn’t need a draft speech; he knew what he would say. He had a press secretary, but sometimes drafted press releases.
He hasn’t fully abandoned those ways now. Trademark leadershipcampaign phrases, like “fire the gatekeepers,” came from him. His sophisticated social-media leadership campaign was managed by a team, but the building of his online brand was, according to a friend, “all Pierre.”
In 2015, he was shuffled into a massive department, Employment and Social Development, but with eight months to an election, his key task was promoting the Universal Child Care Benefit cheques the government sent to parents. He crisscrossed the country, ostensibly searching for eligible parents who hadn’t applied, then promoting an expansion of the benefits - with a mock cheque made out to parents on his podium.
In Halifax, he had another idea. Unbeknownst even to his political staff, Mr. Poilievre showed up for the government announcement in a blue golf shirt with a Conservative Party logo. And it created an immediate uproar: The minister had turned government business into partisan campaigning.
But Mr. Poilievre had a simple explanation for blindsided aides: Without the logo controversy, the announcement wouldn’t have made it onto TV news. Ordinary families wouldn’t care about a logo - but they’d remember the cheques.
The shirt was no accident. And it was no exception, then or now. The provocative statements, marching with convoy figures, saying he’d fire the Governor of the Bank of Canada - none of it is shooting off at the mouth. He is calculated. Sometimes that means reaching his target audience by upsetting another group - preferably progressives or Liberals.
There is some savouring of that as payback from a politician who, despite decades in the corridors of power, claims to speak for those treated with disdain by the establishment, Liberal politicians and the media.
He strives to speak in simple language. In a 2015 interview, he derided the “modern-day Latin” politicians use. His constituents, he said then, have pragmatic concerns, and barely hear the criticism that he’s overly partisan.
Even colleagues and staff who weren’t fans of his were amazed by his energy, long hours, and capacity as a message machine.
He could deliver the same speech flawlessly in different towns, adjusting for local details or anecdotes, without even a piece of paper. In fact, some found it disquieting that he was so unrelentingly self-scripted - everything, every word, planned and practised to robotic efficiency.
As party leader now, he won’t be able to control so much directly, however, and he has yet to lead an organization where he has to hand off major responsibilities or manage big egos. He is something of a solitary figure. He has a few friends, like Mr. Cooper, but he is not the centre of a social circle. Although he’s known some Conservative MPs for 20 years, he was a bit of a loner in caucus.
As a politician, he’s never had to make the big saw-offs between principles and political pragmatism. Even now, he hasn’t revealed how he would: Apart from his pledge to “unleash” the oil and gas industry from climate levies and regulations and a few attention-grabbing announcements, his leadership campaign offered little detailed policy.
Certainly, he knows getting elected requires more than ideology: As a backbencher, he lobbied ministers for federal funds for a $50-million bridge in his riding to shorten constituents’ commutes.
As employment minister, the child-benefit program he promoted aggressively, which transferred tax money to parents, was very unlike his Milton Friedman principles. At the time, he said it was better than a state daycare program.
“What has evolved is my tactics,” he told The Globe. “Everything has to be compared to its alternative.
“If the question is a new government program or more personal choice, I always choose more personal choice.”
W hen the 2015 election saw the Conservatives swept of power, Mr. Poilievre also saw it as a near-death experience for his political career. His margin of victory in his Carleton riding shrank to less than 2,000 votes.
“I think he had to do a really deep think,” Mr. Majumdar said. “What does this mean next for me, personally, in my life? For my country, my party, the thing that I do?” The political lifer stayed out of the Conservatives’ 2017 leadership race. When interim leader Rona Ambrose approached him about a shadow-cabinet post in 2016, Mr. Poilievre told her he wanted to work quietly in the background on Conservative policies for poverty and low-income earners, and he was given a lower-profile, custom-fit portfolio. And he started to work on a never-published book about economics and policy.
It’s not clear from colleagues and friends just how existential that reflection was. But at the time, people who knew Mr. Poilievre started to say he had “matured.” He was more tempered, more relaxed.
The biggest change was in his personal life. He began a relationship with Anaida Galindo, then an aide to a Conservative senator. She had emigrated from Venezuela as a child and grew up in East End Montreal.
For a man whose personal life had rarely been far from politics - the only hobby friends name is going to the gym - it was obviously life-changing. Although Mr. Poilievre has recently described big, boisterous gatherings with his in-laws, the two slipped away alone to be married in Portugal on New Year’s Eve in 2017. They became parents, to Valentina, born in 2018, and Cruz, born in 2021. For more than four years, he has been going home to family.
One colleague described the change by saying Anaida “makes him normal.”
Already, Anaida is emerging as part of the political image-making - Mr. Poilievre’s first reaction to being declared leader was a Hollywood kiss with his wife, and the first words were her introduction of her husband. They brought their son, Cruz, to mark his first birthday at his first Conservative caucus meeting as leader, with reporters and TV cameras in attendance.
But there is a public Pierre, and a private Pierre, and the latter only shows himself in glimpses.
Friends don’t really describe his emotional life, or detail how he grappled with big life moments. He isn’t emotive, one said. The inner Pierre stays inside.
It’s not clear if it is family life that altered some of Mr. Poilievre’s social politics. The explanation he gave to La Presse in 2020 for becoming a supporter of gay marriage was that, like many others, he had learned a lot over time. He has said less about how his stand on abortion - as a rookie MP he was anti-abortion - has changed. In 2020, he adopted the position, as Mr. Harper had before him, that he would not lead a government that legislated on abortion. This year, he said he is pro-choice.
But it is clear that in his post-2015 rethink he honed his economic ideas. The book he toyed with and the opposition work on low-income workers were followed by Commons speeches that previewed his leadership campaign rhetoric about gatekeepers. After then-leader Andrew Scheer appointed him as the party’s finance critic in 2017, his aggressive interrogations started to go viral on social media.
I f vaccine mandates and truckers’ convoys lit the fire for Mr. Poilievre’s leadership campaign, it was almost kismet that a politician inspired by Milton Friedman’s ideas about freedom was given an opportunity to use the economist’s big issue - inflation - as the fuel.
You can find Mr. Friedman’s borrowed phrases in the 10-minute video about money that Mr. Poilievre posted in January, and in his simple explanation for inflation: that Liberal spending led the Bank of Canada to print money, devaluing the currency, and causing prices to rise.
Forget for a moment that it’s inaccurate to describe the Bank of Canada’s quantitative easing, which expanded the money supply but not the amount of cash, as “printing money.”
It’s more relevant that the goal of quantitative easing was to prevent the pandemic economy from teetering into recession, and that in 2020 even Mr. Poilievre described the big pandemic benefits and job subsidies as necessary. McGill University economist Chris Ragan also noted that quantitative easing hasn’t always led to inflation.
Still, Mr. Poilievre was calling out the risk of damaging inflation in early 2021, and seven months later, needling Bank of Canada Governor Tiff Macklem as the central bank played down inflation as “transitory.”
Mr. Poilievre’s pledge to fire Mr. Macklem has raised concerns about the central bank’s independence. But it is also Mr. Poilievre’s way of reminding people that his warnings were ahead of the curve.
Behind the warnings, however, he expresses surprising skepticism that central banks will resist pressure to devalue money unless they are barred from doing so - raising questions of whether, if in power, he would shackle the Bank of Canada’s capacity to counter a recession.
His suggestion back in March that cryptocurrency could protect Canadians against inflation appeared to reflect his anti-government instinct: favouring decentralized blockchain tokens over state currency. At least, that’s the way it sounded before cryptocurrencies crashed in April.
The crypto flirtation was at least partly political marketing to potential supporters for a politician who had an online presence that intertwined his audience with crypto bros, pandemic protesters and YouTubers.
He had slipped the bounds of political news pages and become a social-media star, with hashtags like #Justinflation as catchphrases. In 2021, his Twitter following grew by 50 per cent. In 2022, it has more than doubled to 430,000 followers.
It was Mr. Poilievre himself who built his online brand, asking colleagues for tips, and emulating hot-button tweets. One that garnered tens of thousands of responses was his November, 2021, petition to stop the “great reset,” referring to a World Economic Forum book that conspiracy theorists see as 84-year-old WEF founder Klaus Schwab’s blueprint for using the pandemic to take over the world, ostensibly with acolytes including Mr. Trudeau.
By then, Mr. Poilievre arguably had more profile than Conservative leader Erin O’Toole, who had shuffled the polarizing MP out of the finance critic’s job months before the 2021 election, then back in after it. And Mr. Poilievre was clearly putting himself in the window for a potential leadership race.
In January, when Mr. O’Toole’s leadership was on the ropes, it was a lot of the old Reform and Canadian Alliance interns, such as Mr. Scheer and Ms. Stubbs, leading the charge. Mr. O’Toole’s most intractable critics told fellow MPs that if they didn’t oust him, the internal battle would continue.
The convoy was the watershed. The spread of the Omicron COVID-19 variant had shifted the politics of vaccine mandates, and lockdown frustrations were high. Mr. Poilievre started railing against vaccine mandates for cross-border truckers. And as the convoy rolled toward Ottawa, Mr. Poilievre posted a Twitter video framing it as a broader freedom protest against Mr. Trudeau’s government and its economic record.
Four days later, Mr. O’Toole was out.
Three days after that, Mr. Poilievre was in the race to succeed him.
Now that he is Conservative Leader, don’t expect him to disavow his connections to convoys. He makes it a point of pride not to be seen conceding.
But people around him predict those pandemic-protest issues will recede from the news, and Mr. Poilievre will be left with meat-and-potatoes issues of inflation and affordability and the lingering feeling of visceral public frustration with Justin Trudeau.
His viral-video reach makes him a new kind of opponent for Mr. Trudeau, though the Conservative Leader doesn’t yet have the celebrity on the scale of the Prime Minister. An Ipsos online poll of 1,001 adults conducted in late August found 42 per cent didn’t know enough abut Mr. Poilievre to form an opinion.
His leadership campaign themes of scrapping the carbon tax and freeing the oil industry from climate policies, controlling spending and cutting taxes, and fighting inflation, sat alongside culture-war pledges such as defunding the CBC. He promised to cut infrastructure funding for cities that are slow to approve residential building. But his campaign was light on policy specifics.
He said little about how he’d deal with inflation now that it is here. His tax plank left details to a future task force.
Mr. Poilievre has changed over time, from the smug 25-year-old MP to the 43year-old father of young children whose manner has tempered. One veteran Conservative acknowledged it by saying he’s no longer the Pierre they wanted to punch in the face.
But the thing about Pierre Poilievre is that the lifelong political performer has been so remarkably consistent over time that it can be hard to figure precisely how and how much he has changed. “Pierre has always been a version of himself,” Mr. Teneycke said.
Mr. Poilievre is driven, combative and a calculated communicator. He has for decades criticized lukewarm conservatives.
His goal is moving the public to the right, not moving the party to the centre.
He is a lifelong proselytizer, and the mission has always been both his small-government cause and his political ambition.

Full text: 8 Mayhill Cres., Toronto GOLFDALE GARDENS Asking price: $999,999 (July, 2022) Previous asking prices: $1.089-million (Mid-June, 2022); $1,185,000 (Early June, 2022); $1.2-million (May, 2022); $1.3-million (April, 2022) Selling price: $970,000 (August, 2022) Previous selling prices: $330,000 (June, 2010); $270,000 (April, 2004) Taxes: $3,116 (2021) Days on the market: 14 Listing agent: Lal Chowdhry, Coldwell Banker – R.M.R. Real Estate THE ACTION In April, this four-level back split was listed for $1.3-million, which was roughly the amount the neighbouring house sold for at the peak of the market.
But with interest rates rising – along with local housing inventory – buyers weren’t biting. The sellers dropped the asking price several times before settling at in July. An offer of $970,000 was accepted in August.
“The market changed so rapidly,” said agent Lal Chowdhry. “It was difficult, and took time, for the sellers to accept that the price they expected was no longer attainable, especially when they knew what other properties in their area sold for in the early months of this year.”
“But we didn’t consider offers in the low- or mid-$900,000s because this house was fully done.
There were no major issues.”
One of the home’s upper-level bedrooms had been renovated to create a den and ensuite bathroom for the primary bedroom.
The loss of that bedroom may have impacted the final sale price.
“The buyers wanted to come down on price because they would have to spend extra money to get the layout back to what it was before,” Mr. Chowdhry said.
WHAT THEY GOT The more than 60year-old house has a private driveway and sits on a 43- by 137-foot lot.
The roof, windows and major mechanical systems have been recently upgraded, and the eat-in kitchen has been revamped with stainless steel appliances and hardwood floors.
Open living and dining areas are on the main floor and there are two more bedrooms on the lower level.
In the basement, there is a secondary kitchen and a recreation area, plus a rear exit and one of the home’s three bathrooms.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “It’s on a street that’s very convenient for folks to get to transit and the 401 [highway],” Mr. Chowdhry said.
“There’s a school down the street, and the Scarborough golf course is also down another street.”

Banff’s housing struggle falls hardest on disadvantaged: Non-profit brings new accommodations to residents fleeing domestic violence, trauma or those with a disability

Full text: Finding a place to live in Banff, Alta., is becoming increasingly difficult for workers, whether they’re seasonal or permanent, as the constraints imposed by Parks Canada to ensure environmental conservation in a national park townsite limit the availability of developable land and challenge redevelopment.
With an area of just under four square kilometres, Banff’s fixed boundaries were set by Parks Canada in 1990, when the town incorporated. “Banff has a very limited land base,” says Banff Mayor Corrie DiManno, adding that most of the developable land in the town has already been allocated.
“That means that any development happening is redevelopment, and that takes more time and more cost than greenfield development,” Ms. DiManno says.
“We are fortunate we don’t have urban sprawl, and that we can maintain very high standards for infrastructure – but that also means that we can’t expand to build new houses.”
As Banff’s population increased by 9.5 per cent in the past decade, despite Parks Canada’s stringent residency requirements, rental vacancy rates in Banff have hovered just above zero.
In 2019, Banff’s administration calculated a shortfall of 308 dwellings to house the existing population without overcrowding, a number that’s expected to increase to 723 in the next five years.
“Assumptions were made in the 1990s, when we were doing incorporation, that had to do with our future residential needs,” Ms. DiManno says. “Parks actually removed a pretty significant amount of developable land, and now, in hindsight, we’re realizing that’s really affected our ability to build new housing.”
Banff’s housing shortfall is especially challenging for residents fleeing domestic violence, trauma, or those with a disability, explains Ebony Rempel, CEO of YWCA Banff, a non-profit organization whose programs and resources support women in the Bow Valley, and the provision of affordable housing is key to their mission.
The completion of Dr. Priscilla Wilson’s Place in August expands YWCA Banff’s capacity to provide safe and stable housing to more than 70 residents. In 2021, the organization housed 103 individuals.
“The real crux and reason why we opened this building was because within our current inventory we didn’t have any spaces that were suitable for families,” Ms. Rempel says. “We wanted to be able to offer that continuum of supportive housing to many different types of individuals and families.”
The grand opening of Dr. Priscilla Wilson’s Place was scheduled for Thursday, but it’s been postponed in observance of the 10-day mourning period for the late Queen Elizabeth.
Designed by LOLA Architecture, a Calgary firm, Dr. Priscilla Wilson’s Place is a 33-unit, multifamily building. Its innovative structure is made up of 62 recycled shipping containers that contribute not only to layout flexibility and adaptability, but also to achieve net-zero energy efficiency and long-term affordability.
“[Sustainability] was really important to almost all parties,” Ms. Rempel says, noting that this building was part of the Sustainable Housing Initiative, a pilot project led by the Alberta Rural Development Network to develop affordable and energy-efficient homes using recycled shipping containers.
Rental rates at Dr. Priscilla Wilson’s Place are between 10 and 20 per cent below market, providing Banff residents and families with a yearly household income of up to $75,000 with access to housing alternatives ranging from studio apartments to four-bedroom units, as well as barrier-free options.
Upon completion, the 33-unit building received more than 100 applications, Ms. Rempel says.
“Folks that identify as having a disability were prioritized in terms of getting access to the building. Folks that have children were also prioritized, and folks that have identified trauma in their life.”
The location of the 24,425square-feet building, in the courtyard of an already existing facility on Banff’s Spray Avenue, spared YWCA Banff from some of challenges related to land availability and cost in Banff – but redeveloping the property was not a smooth process.
In national park townsites such as Banff, the availability of land isn’t the only challenge to developing new housing. In the name of environmental and character preservation, the town’s management plan also mandates the protection of wildlife corridors, native vegetation and lines of sight.
“We’re building in a tourism community, so there’s protocols in terms of what your building looks like,” Ms. Rempel says, acknowledging that these requirements aren’t unique to Banff.
“But this adds another extra layer of complexity.”
In the case of Dr. Priscilla Wilson’s Place, Parks Canada’s concerns regarding ground squirrel habitat on the site had to be addressed prior to construction.
“We [had] to make sure we were not disrupting any of the wildlife pathways and breeding habits,” Ms. Rempel says. “And right on our property we have ground squirrels, so [Parks Canada] made an assessment that the mating of the ground squirrels was happening outside of our property line.”
Moreover, redeveloping a property in a national park requires an extensive approval process.
“There’s different layers and different forms of government that we had to go through for approvals,” Ms. Rempel says about requiring permits from both the Town of Banff and Parks Canada.
“Because we’re in a national park, and preservation and sustainability is a main goal of Parks Canada and Banff National Park, there were lots of hiccups along the road.”
Having broken ground in August, 2020, Dr. Priscilla Wilson’s Place’s biggest challenge were the delays caused by supply chain issues and inflation, Ms. Rempel says, which extended construction by 10 months and cost the organization an additional $5-million over the initial budget of $9million.
To overcome the housing shortfall, the town of Banff requires more than 720 new housing units be built by 2027 and reach a healthy vacancy rate of 3 per cent. To achieve this, the town has implemented policies requiring staff accommodation in all new commercial developments (or cash in-lieu), and building belowmarket housing themselves.
About 10 per cent of Banff’s housing stock has been constructed since 2013, Ms. DiManno says, including a 131-unit belowmarket rental apartment building developed by the Banff Housing Corporation in 2017 with funding from local and senior levels of government.
“If Parks Canada allocates any type of land under their control in the townsite to us, we try to use it for the purpose of housing,” Ms. DiManno says, noting there’s only two parcels left to be developed.
One of these sites is on Banff Avenue, where the Aster, a pricerestricted condo building of 33 units, is currently under construction. The very last parcel, located on Cave Avenue, is on preliminary design.
By contrast, in the municipality of Jasper, a national park townsite of 4,200 residents, few rental units have been created in the past decade, despite a seasonal population that’s twice as large as that of Banff’s – and a housing gap that exceeds 1,000 units. Currently, a proposal for a 32-unit apartment building in Jasper faces community opposition.
“A big piece of affordability and financing, is that we really want the federal and provincial governments to help support Banff in our housing strategies,” Ms. DiManno says. “The Aster has not received any funding from other governments.”

Truly affordable housing being lost: Programs designed to help renters aren’t keeping up with redevelopments that raise rental costs

Full text: VANCOUVER I n a space of five years, between 2011 and 2016, Canada lost 322,000 affordable homes. In the same period of time, the country built about 60,000 new homes for people most in need, according to housing expert and consultant Steve Pomeroy.
“Affordable” in this case is defined as rental units under $750 a month. The units lost were either demolished or renovated for more expensive units, according to the last census data.
“Without looking at the erosion and the loss of existing stock, it’s a real serious problem,” says housing policy expert Steve Pomeroy. “And it’s associated with the financialization issue, it’s associated with redevelopment, and intensification pressures, the kind of stuff you are talking about there on Broadway,” he said, referring to Vancouver’s recently approved Broadway Plan, which will add an estimated 50,000 residents once much of the existing stock is redeveloped.
What is seldom acknowledged is the amount of housing lost in that process of redevelopment.
“That’s absolutely the existential threat to the affordability problem,” Prof. Pomeroy said.
The majority of households in need of affordable housing are renters, with 80 per cent in the bottom fifth of household incomes, according to a report commissioned by the National Housing Council. The report, released in February but largely ignored, reviewed the federal government’s Rental Construction Financing Initiative and showed that new housing generated by the RCFI was significantly more expensive than the housing it replaced.
Prof. Pomeroy says that in most cities, median rents for newly built units under the program more than doubled as a result of its affordability criteria.
The federal government announced that Squamish Nation and Westbank development Senakw would be the recipient of a record $1.4-billion under the RCFI program. Among other perks, it offers private developers and non-profits ultralow interest rates for a 10-year term, amortized over 50 years. The program is part of the National Housing Strategy which aims to address housing need and homelessness.
Prof. Pomeroy, an adjunct professor at Carleton University’s Centre for Urban Research and Education, advises governments on housing policy. He is an urban planner and housing policy research consultant, based in Ottawa. In February, he analyzed new census data and found that 1.3 million homes in Canada are not lived in full time. Last fall he wrote that if government wants to improve affordability and home-ownership accessibility, they need to address “supercharged demand” rather than simply lack of supply.
Prof. Pomeroy and others are taking the NHS to task for contributing to the loss of truly affordable housing, particularly as rents continue to increase.
“There is nothing in the National Housing Strategy or any subsequent initiatives that have really tried to target that particular aspect of the problem,” Prof.
Pomeroy said.
Prof. Pomeroy calls the RCFI the NHS “centrepiece” because it has grown to account for 40 per cent of the NHS funding, at $25.75-billion. However, it acts as a major bonus to developers who, responding to the market, were already planning to build rental housing anyway, he says.
Only 3 per cent of the housing funded by the RCFI was affordable to low income households, according to the NHS-commissioned report.
It stated that the RCFI affordability criteria failed to result in “meaningful downward pressure on rents, often permitting units with rents that are well above market rent in the areas in which they were located to be counted as affordable.”
Based on the criteria used for Senakw, the affordable rents will be 30 per cent of median family incomes in the census area. Prof.
Pomeroy said while that sounds fine on paper, the true affordability is another matter.
For example, the median total income of Vancouver families is $98,640, based on 2020 statistics.
That would mean an “affordable” median rent of $2,466 for 20 per cent of units supported by the program.
“The thing happening is that many of the new units being built through these rental construction programs are demolishing existing older three-storey buildings,” said Ann McAfee, a member of the National Housing Council, former co-director of planning for the city of Vancouver and an adjunct professor at the University of British Columbia.
“If you’ve followed what’s been happening in Burnaby and in Burquitlam Skytrain area in Coquitlam, you’ll see there is quite a number of modest priced rental units that have been demolished in order to build the new units. So not only are the new units coming on stream not affordable to modest or low income people, but in many cases, they are resulting in the demolition of the units that are affordable to that group.”
The question comes down to the net gain, Prof. McAfee said.
The CMHC said the RCFI is supporting the creation of 37,700 units. But how many will be lost?
“There is no doubt that one issue we are facing is that the supply of existing affordable housing is eroding, and whether it’s the federal government rental supply program, or the financialization of housing through REITs [real estate investment trusts] and other private investors, is resulting in the demolition or the purchase and up-pricing of that older rental stock.
“So on one hand, you’ve got government trying to add to the stock that’s affordable to those in core housing need, but at same time, through other initiatives, such as the construction of these new units … resulting in a faster loss than it is a gain.”
A key problem with the RCFI program is that it was intended to generate the supply of middle-income rental stock instead of helping those with low incomes, Prof.
Pomeroy says.
The CMHC confirmed in an email that, “The Rental Construction Financing Initiative was brought forward to expand the supply of rental housing available to Canada’s middle class through the construction of more than 71,000 new units across the country.”
The biggest cause of expensive housing is lack of supply, said the CMHC, adding that the program had also led to savings between $92 and $642 a month for renters, depending on the area.
The CMHC said the program is being adjusted to increase affordability of the homes, with a target based on a percentage of local market rents, for at least 40 per cent of the units that receive support.
If housing providers greatly exceed affordability and energy efficiency goals, they’d be eligible to have a portion of their loans converted to non-repayable loans, said the statement.
In previous interviews, Prof.
Pomeroy has argued that he has found no proof that more market rate supply will lower or stabilize housing costs in a market such as Vancouver’s. And a program to stimulate supply of rental may not be necessary because rental housing starts have increased significantly in recent years, he says.
“We have to think of housing as a system. If you are only directing your policy and programming to one part of the system, and not doing much in the others, then there are unintended and inadvertent consequences,” he says.
“So if young families can’t afford to buy a house, they stay in the rental market. We now have a number of pretty well-heeled renters creating demand in the rental market, which is why developers can build rental housing at $2,500 a month.
“And as those folks stay in the rental market instead of moving into home ownership, vacancy rates go down and rents go up and people at the bottom of the market get hurt.”
Prof. Pomeroy says money spent on the RCFI program could better be spent elsewhere. The vast majority of people are in core housing need because their incomes are low. He supports the funding of non-market housing in combination with housing allowances that help low-income households get into secure housing and back on their feet.
“Most of the affordability crisis that [the media] write about is the crisis that our kids can’t afford to buy a house. The true affordability crisis is for the folks at the very low end of the rental market, where we just don’t have enough rental housing at low rents.”

“There aren’t many [condominiums] in that neighbourhood, and this one was over 1,700 square feet,” agent Brayden Irwin said.
“Over all, in Toronto, there’s less inventory of units of that size, and even less three-bedroom units, many of which have not been renovated or have the same quality in them.”
Within days, the seller had two offers, accepting one that added $82,500 to the asking price.
“It goes to show that it’s not all doom and gloom in the Toronto market,” Mr. Irwin said.
“When there’s good product in good neighbourhoods, people are still looking to buy, and sometimes there are not a lot of options for that type of property.”
WHAT THEY GOT This more than 20-year-old suite has a laundry room with a sink, a living room with a fireplace and a dining area with one of two access points to a wide balcony.
The kitchen was recently retooled with a nine-foot-long island, marble countertops and upscale appliances, as well as hardwood flooring and pot lights.
The primary bedroom contains a walk-in closet and a four-piece bathroom.
The unit includes a storage locker and two parking spots. Monthly fees are $1,655, which pays for 24-hour concierge and use of a gym, pool and rooftop deck.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “The whole unit had a high-end renovation, so it was quite beautiful,” Mr. Irwin said.
“And it looked out over the treetops east of the building.”

Full text: Laurentian University has cleared a key hurdle in its attempt to emerge from insolvency after creditors voted in favour of a plan that would see the postsecondary institution repay a fraction of the money it owes.
The stakes were high ahead of Wednesday’s vote. Participants were told that if they rejected the proposal, the Sudbury university would potentially be dissolved, with staff facing termination and students forced to continue their education elsewhere.
In order to be approved, the plan needed the support of more than 50 per cent of individual creditors, and those voting in favour had to hold more than twothirds of the total debt. More than 87 per cent of individual voters approved the plan, and their votes represented 69 per cent of the outstanding debt.
Laurentian University board chair Jeff Bangs was visibly relieved after the result was announced. He said the campaign to secure a “yes” vote had given him many sleepless nights.
“After today we have the chance to rebuild,” Mr. Bangs said. “We can start to take back control.” Laurentian became the first publicly funded university in Canada to file for insolvency in February, 2021. As part of its restructuring, the institution terminated nearly 200 professors and staff and eliminated nearly 70 academic programs.
The terminated faculty made up a significant portion of those eligible to vote on the proposed plan. The result means they and other creditors will have to accept repayment of between 14 and 24 per cent of what they are owed. For many of the long-time employees, the amounts they are due in severance exceed $500,000. Similarly, banks and local businesses were also among those owed amounts that ranged from millions to a few thousand.
Mr. Bangs paid tribute to those who voted to accept the deal as well as those who did not, recognizing the difficult circumstances of such a vote in a small community.
Faculty association president Fabrice Colin deemed Wednesday the start of a new chapter for Laurentian. Both the faculty association and the staff union had joined with the university administration in asking for a “yes” vote, but he recognized that for many it would a hard pill to swallow.
“Creditors are receiving only a fraction of what they are owed,” Mr. Colin said.
Eduardo Galiano-Riveros, a professor who lost his job in the insolvency, is the spokesperson for a group of terminated faculty that campaigned for a “no” vote.
He said the result was much closer than expected and shows that many people disapproved of the outcome. He vowed to continue to work to expose what went wrong at Laurentian and who was responsible.
“This was not a landslide,” Mr. Galiano-Riveros said. “The fight goes on.”
On campus, the reaction to the vote was muted. There were no gatherings to celebrate the result, but several people expressed relief that the university had survived this step.
“This means that we can move forward and get out from under the yoke of the court appointed monitor, who has basically been in financial control of the university,” said Albrecht Schulte-Hostedde, a professor of ecology.
He said he remains deeply upset about the damage to the university’s reputation and the loss of so many programs and colleagues, though some kind of rebuilding can at least begin.
Dax Law, a fourth-year psychology student, said he welcomed the result.
“This place is absolutely critical to Sudbury, to the North. We should make every effort to preserve it,” he said.
Mr. Bangs, a public-affairs consultant who was appointed chair of the board earlier this year, said the court and the Ontario government would continue to play important roles overseeing the university’s plans in the months and years ahead.
The plan to pay creditors was made possible by the Queen’s Park decision to buy more than $50-million in real estate assets from Laurentian.
Mr. Bangs said the province and the monitor will continue to be like “big brother and big sister” overseeing the university’s plans as it moves to regain control of its affairs. He said Laurentian now has to build the muscles required to walk and then run on its own, which will mean better governance and keeping a careful eye on student demand as it chooses where to hire new faculty.
Nearly all of the university’s board has been replaced since the insolvency proceedings began, Mr. Bangs said.
The university’s president, Robert Haché, and its provost, Marie Josée Berger, have announced this summer they will retire before the university emerges from the insolvency process.

Stewart under attack for fundraising strategy: Several prominent developers confirm mayor’s re-election campaign asked them to meet specific donation targets

Full text: Several prominent Vancouver developers confirm they have been asked by Mayor Kennedy Stewart’s re-election team to contribute to his campaign and solicit donations on his behalf, with fundraising targets specified for them.
The developers corroborated information in a spreadsheet found on a sidewalk near City Hall by Stanley Woodvine, a homeless man who tweets about interesting documents he finds. The file lists 26 names, including Vancouver Canucks owner and Aquilini Investments managing director Francesco Aquilini; Concord Pacific chief executive officer Terry Hui; former city councillor Raymond Louie, who is now CEO of Coromandel Properties; and Wesgroup Properties president Beau Jarvis.
On the spreadsheet, those listed are designated as “captains” and beside their names are columns indicating targets ranging from $5,000 to $110,000, as well as the amount raised so far.
Mr. Woodvine, who lives in a parking garage, said Wednesday that he picked up the two-page document earlier this week, ahead of the Vancouver mayoral election on Oct. 15.
While asking for political contributions is neither new nor controversial, the document has prompted Mr. Stewart’s political opponents to question whether the tactic of asking developers to act as fundraisers and meet declared targets is ethical. The list has also caused consternation from some of those who are on it.
B.C. civic parties have struggled to fund campaigns since the NDP government changed donation rules in time for the 2018 municipal elections, banning corporate and union donations and limiting personal donations. This year, the limit is $1,250.
Four people in the development community confirmed to The Globe and Mail that the document appears to be authentic because it matches requests and conversations they have had with the mayor’s team.
To meet the targeted requests without breaking rules, the “captains” are encouraged to ask friends, family and people within their work networks to contribute up to the maximum amount.
A spokesperson for the mayor’s party issued a statement saying Mr. Stewart’s campaign has complied with all election rules.
The statement did not directly address the document.
Reliance Properties CEO Jon Stovell, who is marked down to raise a target of $12,500, confirmed he was asked to meet that target but it “is not something I agreed to.” He is listed on the document as having raised only $2,500 so far toward the campaign. He said he gives money to every legitimate political party that will accept a donation from him.
The four people contacted by The Globe said the target amount that appears next to their names is not a number they suggested, committed to or, in one case, even knew about.
The list also features a few non-developers, including former NDP cabinet minister Moe Sihota, former NDP party president Craig Keating and two women who work in tourism, hospitality and public relations.
The list does not specifically name the mayor’s party, Forward Together, but there are references to Neil, or NM, and Mark in the document. Mr. Stewart’s chief of staff is Neil Monckton, and his party’s executive director is Mark Hosak.
Mr. Monckton did not respond to a request for an interview. Mr. Hosak declined to directly address the spreadsheet.
The campaign manager for ABC, the party that is running Ken Sim for mayor, said while the document doesn’t indicate any laws were broken, the strategy challenges the spirit of the law.
“I don’t think it’s an Elections BC violation but, boy, when the mayor’s chief of staff is starting to lean on people he’s supposed to be regulating, that’s an ethical lapse,” Kareem Allam said.
Mr. Allam said ABC, like all political parties, asks people who are supportive to ask their friends and family to donate. He said his party has never asked anyone to get employees or colleagues to donate. He added that the idea of a target “crosses the line.”
Mr. Aquilini was listed with the largest target of $110,000, and the spreadsheet indicated he had raised the most at $64,750. A spokesperson for his company could not be reached by deadline.
Bob Rennie, prominent real estate marketer, art collector and past chief fundraiser for the B.C. Liberal Party, is also on the list as having met the target of $12,500, with a note suggesting “NM to propose doubling goal on Sept. 12.” Mr. Rennie did not respond to a request for comment.
B.C. civic parties have tried to cope with the reduction in campaign donations that resulted from the 2018 rules by starting their fundraising early. Both Mr. Stewart and Mr. Sim have worked to raise money every year since the civic election four years ago.
A number of donors or groups have also come up with creative ways to donate without breaking the rules. In 2018, developer Peter Wall gave $85,000 to the campaign of mayoral candidate Hector Bremner during the period in September before the date that limits donations. (The NDP government extended the limitation period after that.)
Also in that election, negative campaign ads attacking mayoral candidates in Surrey appeared on Facebook with no information about who was paying for them.

Full text: Google parent Alphabet Inc.
gained support from Justin Trudeau for its plan to build a technology-driven community in Toronto after a private, undisclosed call between the Prime Minister and the company’s chairman before the project was ever made public.
The conversation took place in January, 2017, two months before the project was open for bidders, and was not pro-actively disclosed by the Prime Minister’s Office, Alphabet, Google or its citybuilding affiliate Sidewalk Labs – nor was it documented in federal lobbying records. Yet the call set into motion events that created significant public skepticism toward a project with global consequences.
The project ended up being cancelled in the early months of the pandemic.
The conversation was described in a redacted 2017 memo to the Prime Minister, which was first obtained under freedom-ofinformation legislation by The Globe and Mail in 2018 – but only revealed after a reporter spent three years pushing the Office of the Information Commissioner of Canada to have the memo unredacted.
Nine months after the call between Mr. Trudeau and Eric Schmidt, the former CEO of Google and one of the world’s most influential technology leaders, Sidewalk Labs won the right to plan a 12-acre community, called Quayside, on the edge of Lake Ontario in downtown Toronto.
It was billed as a world-leading example of forward-thinking city building with a Big Tech partner, and Mr. Trudeau showed great excitement at the October, 2017, Quayside announcement.
Instead, the project became a cautionary tale for what can go wrong when a digital giant tries to expand its influence into the physical world. Sidewalk Labs courted an unending stream of controversies as it sought government-like powers and access to some of the most valuable underdeveloped real estate in North America – while stirring debate over the future of privacy and the complex power dynamics between governments and corporate behemoths.
The call between Mr. Trudeau and Mr. Schmidt is revealed in The Globe reporter’s forthcoming book, Sideways: The City Google Couldn’t Buy, which will be published by Random House Canada this week.
The pair’s relationship was criticized for years by Sidewalk Labs’ biggest opponents, who argued that Canadians deserved a clear account of their conversations, in order to ensure that the project was tendered competitively and in the best interests of the public.
Sidewalk Labs’ Toronto project was cancelled as the company struggled to make its economics work across just 12 acres, as real estate markets worldwide were thrown into disarray.
The Privy Council Office released an unredacted version of the 2017 memo to Mr. Trudeau to The Globe reporter as the book approached publication. It showed that on Jan. 16, 2017, Mr. Trudeau had a call with someone from Alphabet to discuss its “interest in partnering with Waterfront Toronto in creating a smart city using only autonomous vehicles.”
Waterfront Toronto was the tripartite government agency steering the project, and says it was not apprised of the call – which took place two months before the agency issued a request-for-proposals for the land. The agency has consistently maintained that it ran a fair, competitive and transparent tender process for the 12 acres of land in question on the eastern downtown lakeshore.
Though applicants were prohibited from speaking with politicians during the process, the call took place before the tender period – bypassing the no-communications rule.
Waterfront Toronto declined to comment beyond acknowledging it only learned of the call between Mr. Trudeau and Mr. Schmidt when told by a Globe reporter.
The call was also never previously disclosed to the public, including after The Globe asked the PMO in 2019 about Mr. Trudeau’s conversations with Google and Alphabet after viewing the original redacted memo. At the time, the PMO said that Mr. Trudeau regularly engages with global business leaders with an eye toward economic development. Subsequent memos obtained from 2017 indicated strong interest by the PMO in the economic development activities Sidewalk Labs could bring to Canada.
The Globe’s 2019 query to the PMO attempted to clarify widespread speculation that the controversial Sidewalk Toronto project had been secretly influenced by the Prime Minister’s Office, after comments by Mr. Trudeau at its October, 2017, announcement that he and Mr. Schmidt had been “talking about collaborating on this for a few years now. Seeing it all come together today is extraordinarily exciting.”
After The Globe shared details of the unredacted memo, the Prime Minister’s Office subsequently confirmed its records showed that the call was with Mr. Schmidt, despite not providing details when earlier asked. (Mr. Trudeau’s office and Sidewalk Labs have each said there were no subsequent conversations while the project was open to competition.)
This lack of transparency created a vacuum into which misinformation could flow and emboldened opposition to a project that Ottawa had hoped would draw significant attention and economic development to Toronto. Instead, the world’s attention was drawn to the numerous calamities that unfolded.
“Transparency and integrity would have been helpful but the Trudeau government has never made a secret of its cozy relationship with Big Tech, especially Google, Amazon and Facebook,” said Jim Balsillie, the former co-CEO of BlackBerry predecessor Research in Motion, who was one of the biggest critics of how governments handled the project.
“Regardless of how the project was cooked,” he said, “Sidewalk Toronto became a global scandal because three levels of government, Google and an army of local cheerleaders got excited and ready to undermine Canadian civil and digital rights, as well as our economy and democracy.”
The federal government has said that one of the key principles of the Lobbying Act is that “the general public be able to know who is engaged in lobbying activities.” But there are major limitations to those rules, including that a call does not need to be entered on the registry if it is placed by a government official.
Alphabet, Google and Sidewalk Labs – which was disbanded and largely folded into Google in 2021 – have long said they followed all lobbying rules when interacting with the federal government. A Google spokesperson told the reporter in a comment for Sideways that the call was placed by Mr. Trudeau’s office, thereby bypassing the need to be recorded.
Daniel Gold, a consultant who studied lobbying systems including Canada’s as part of his PhD thesis, said in an interview that “I have argued, and quite a number of people have argued for quite a long time, that a truly transparent system would involve reporting by both the government officials doing the contacting, as well as the lobbyists.” As it stands, he said, Canada’s system is “not truly transparent.”
The federal government also inconsistently described the records it has kept about the January, 2017, call. After learning of Mr. Trudeau and Mr. Schmidt’s conversation, The Globe filed another accessto-information request to the Privy Council Office requesting any records from January, 2017, about the call.
Access-to-information staff from the Privy Council Office, which handles such information requests for the Prime Minister’s Office, then said staff could find no records about the call during the period when the call took place – despite the Prime Minister’s Office acknowledging by e-mail that it had records of the call.
The Sidewalk Toronto project was meant to be an exemplary public-private partnership that could show the world what the future’s cities might look like. It was set to feature wood-structured skyscrapers, energy-saving buildings and even garbage-moving robots. Instead, it became an example of how not to plan tomorrow’s cities.
A stream of prominent Canadians and Americans were fired or quit the project as it routinely went off the rails, while other unlikely allies, from Bay Street to activist circles as far away as Berlin, banded together to oppose the project. The Trudeau government began distancing itself from Sidewalk Labs soon after the controversies began to mount, leaving many Canadian opponents frustrated that Ottawa wouldn’t take ownership over a project that might have been smoother with clear federal policy.
The land at Quayside remains largely unchanged since Sidewalk Labs left, though Dream Unlimited Corp. and Great Gulf Group won the chance to build a more traditional development there last February. And Sidewalk Labs’ Toronto office, sitting at the elbow of that L-shaped plot of land, became something many urbanists might cringe at – a rental-truck depot.

Full text: Josh O’Kane spent more than two years covering Google affiliate Sidewalk Labs’ controversial “smart city” in Toronto for The Globe and Mail. On Sept. 13, Random House Canada will publish Sideways: The City Google Couldn’t Buy. The following is an exclusive excerpt from the book.
When people walked into the blue-splashed building at 307 Lake Shore Boulevard East for the first time, they were bound to find something to fill them with awe. Depending on the day, as they passed through the lake-facing doors and into Sidewalk Labs’ central showroom, they might have zeroed in on the floor laden with wooden prototypes of its hexagonal paving tiles. Maybe the vast models of a neighbourhood of wood-framed buildings would make them smile, or the walls plastered with city-building ideas scribbled by members of both Sidewalk and the public.
It conferred the impression of a welcoming oasis in a part of town that was not particularly welcoming. Sidewalk’s Toronto headquarters sat at the long-ignored post-industrial foot of Parliament Street, wedged between Lake Ontario and a raised expressway, right in the elbow of Quayside – the 12-acre plot of land it was hoping to turn into a beacon for the future of cities. Natural light flooded through windows onto gleaming white walls, which were occasionally obstructed by wooden-beam prototypes that looked like what the company some day wanted to use at the core of innovative “tall timber” skyscrapers.
The 307 Lake Shore space was designed to be a symbol of optimism and opportunity. It was supposed to be a glimpse of the bright future Sidewalk wanted to build for Toronto, starting on that very site.
The blue paint made the office stand out among the monochromatic low-rise commercial buildings that lined the block. This deliberate symbolism pulled in optimists from all over Toronto. But it was just a coat of paint. Underneath, it was just as old and grey.
Some people cried with joy when the company offered them a job.
Some cried when they realized Sidewalk wasn’t the company they’d thought it was.
The Toronto office opened in the middle of 2018, and Sidewalk filled it with fresh-faced new recruits. They had quit careers at investment banks, tech companies and governments, and often marvelled at how freely money flowed as they flew back and forth to Hudson Yards to plot out an inclusive neighbourhood of the future. Some staff were surprised by what they viewed as arrogance, sometimes verging on aggression, from some of the New Yorkers who’d fly into Toronto. Their confidence struck the Canadians as bordering on a saviour complex, with Quayside as their plan to turn some backwater Canadian village into the next Hudson Yards. Even the New Yorkers’ mannerisms could feel abrasive, such as when they started meetings or e-mails by going straight to business instead of with friendly small talk. The local staff weren’t sure if it was a New York thing, an American thing, or a Bloomberg administration thing, but the culture clash grew exhausting.
Tensions became so severe by the late summer that the company agreed to hold presentations on Canadian culture for each office. Dozens of people showed up to them. They were led by a former City of Toronto media relations officer named Giannina Warren, who had gone on to do a PhD in the branding of places. She walked the staff through the countries’ divergent histories, and how the city’s angst over the Quayside project was rooted, at least in part, in Canadian resistance to American hegemony. Giants of corporate America had failed in Canada before, she told Sidewalkers, pointing to the department-store chain Target, which had pulled out of the country after only a couple of years in the market. She also explained Canada’s affection for the gravycovered, french-fry-and-cheesecurd delicacy of poutine, a Molson beer ad campaign titled “I Am Canadian,” and the Tragically Hip – a shining example of a pop culture phenomenon that succeeded without America’s warm embrace.
Though some Toronto staff thought it was a cringe-worthy exercise, others were glad to finally have someone explain to their superiors that they were not in New York. When Warren then gave the presentation to the New York office – whose staffers probably needed the education more – people voiced their appreciation but flitted in and out regularly, and most left abruptly at the end.
Some people who were there don’t recall CEO Dan Doctoroff attending; a company spokesman says he attended “parts of these sessions” (and insists that they were not a response to any tensions within the company).
Building in Toronto depended on gaining the trust of Torontonians, but secrecy was baked into Sidewalk’s DNA, stretching back to the days of exploring Larry Page’s fantasy of a regulation-free city on the sea. Not only did this culture make it hard for some employees to trust the company, it left them struggling to do their jobs.
As staff received the public at 307 Lake Shore, they were often asked what the company’s business model was, or how the project would be funded. But responding to those questions was a problem: Sidewalk hadn’t given its staff all the answers. Even a map was hard to find, leaving some staff to speculate that the company didn’t want to remind people they had the right to only 12 acres. All of this put the onceenthusiastic Canadians in an awkward position. The National Observer once reported that in some instances, staff were told to answer simply: “It’s way above my pay grade.”
Some employees began to doubt whether the company itself knew what its business model was. In interviews and public appearances, Doctoroff had begun to rhyme off combinations of real estate investment, infrastructure investment and, sometimes, tech development – the company hoped to make money from one or all of these. After a number of staff complained about the uncertainty, the company sat them down to explain the model, only to give them a variation of the same answer. This was not what staff were looking for. They needed more to win Toronto over, especially as opposition to the project rose throughout 2018.
The public still cycled through the showroom, leaving ideas on cards that would be affixed to a wall, and Sidewalk counted every single person so they could say how many Torontonians the company had consulted. Sidewalk said that number eventually exceeded 11,000, though one person at 307 Lake Shore says it couldn’t have topped 5,000. And all those people’s ideas – just like the brainstorming of the experts consulted for the Yellow Book – didn’t appear to matter. “None of that information went anywhere,” one former Sidewalker says. “It didn’t mean anything.”
This was a common theme in Sidewalk’s history. Doctoroff liked to make people feel important by giving them a seat at the table; he could get his own work done more easily that way, even if he didn’t always pay attention to the people he’d invited. When he campaigned to bring the Olympics to New York decades earlier, he included staff from several city agencies on his facilities advisory board. “As a result, the territorial jockeying that can occur when public officials believe an outsider is attempting to do their jobs for them was minimized,” he later recounted in his memoir. Toward the end of his time at City Hall, as New York developed a long-term sustainability and economic plan, he perfected his seat-at-thetable scheme. Reveal a project’s goals, get feedback from people and politicians, then add details.
That way, he said, “people would feel some ownership of the plan,” lowering the likelihood of dissent.
This was a tactic he’d used at Sidewalk, too, in 2015, splashing the names of dozens of luminaries like Richard Florida and Janette Sadik-Khan across the back page of the Yellow Book. Doctoroff wanted to do the same in Toronto, but the government agency he was ostensibly partnering with, Waterfront Toronto, had warned him against it. Those kinds of meetings were both too exclusive for the government agency’s comfort, and possibly broke the terms of the agreement signed in the summer of 2018.
Sidewalk decided to disregard Waterfront’s warnings.
Doctoroff and a close circle of staff began compiling a list of influential names who could help spread Sidewalk’s gospel. It totalled nearly 70 people: urbanists, not-for-profit champions, executives and at least one former mayor.
They were invited that fall to a private lunch at 307 Lake Shore, where Doctoroff was planning to pitch them personally. Staff were tasked with transforming 307 Lake Shore as the CEO seemed to sweat every detail: the chairs, the tables, the place settings, the floral centrepieces. His obsession with pulling off the perfect day seemed to carry once-in-a-lifetime stakes. Behind his back, some of his employees called the meeting “Dan’s wedding.”
On a cloudy October 17, a fleet of cabs, Ubers and luxury cars delivered the CEO’s hand-picked group of luminaries to the doors of bright-blue 307 Lake Shore.
They were greeted by a sea of familiar faces – the same crew of power brokers that usually showed up to rubber-chicken dinners hosted by the Toronto Region Board of Trade and the Canadian Club. The guests sat down at their tables, each with a Sidewalk staffer there to collect their ideas.
Doctoroff soon stood up, called Toronto his “second home,” then launched into scripted remarks, which included a joke about how recreational marijuana becoming legal in Canada – that very day – made Toronto an even more enticing host city. He ran through Sidewalk’s origin story, calling the company an “essential catalyst” for Waterfront Toronto’s dream of a better, more sustainable future.
The CEO tried to add some clarity to the business model questions that had plagued the company. Sidewalk would invest in infrastructure – an advanced electrical grid, stormwater management – and new technologies to manage traffic, buildings’ energy use and the delivery of social services. The company wanted to prove it was possible to build skyscrapers with wood-based structures. The ideas were so wide-ranging that he sounded like he was playing startup whack-a-mole. He also hinted at his grand vision beyond Quayside: “To create this new community will require substantial development on parcels of land that have laid fallow for decades,” he said.
The CEO got defensive, too, hinting at the Quayside pushback that had ramped up over the past year. “There are times when the prejudgment of what we will propose – and assumptions of ill intent – have taken me by surprise,” he said. “But I can tell you there is nothing more behind the curtain than what I have shared with you today.”
Doctoroff was trying to create the perception that everything was under control, even when it clearly wasn’t. People kept seeing his choices, and the choices of the company he’d built, much differently than he did – including those in the room around him.
As one attendee took his seat, he couldn’t help but notice that the rented chairs, centrepieces and room arrangement seemed familiar. There even seemed to be a head table for VIPs. “Hey,” he whispered to the person next to him. “This feels like a wedding.”

Canada’s farm czar: The country’s largest farmland owner, Robert Andjelic, sees vast potential for the agriculture sector – if Ottawa doesn’t fumble a rare opportunity

Full text: If you had to come up with a worst-case scenario for a global food crisis, it would look a lot like what’s unfolded this year: a dangerous combination of war, drought and punishingly high prices for fertilizer, fuel and crops.
When the food and agricultural arm of the United Nations released its annual report on the state of food insecurity this summer, the agency warned that 345 million people are on the brink of starvation, and that looming famines threaten to bring about “global destabilization, starvation and mass migration on an unprecedented scale.”
Which is more or less the catastrophe Robert Andjelic envisioned more than a decade ago. Once the largest industrial property owner in Winnipeg, Mr. Andjelic set out in 2009, then in his mid-60s, to find an investment he could pass on to his children and grandchildren that would safeguard against the wave of inflation he believed was coming.
Ultimately, his search came down to a simple question: What does Canada have that the world needs, and that China can’t dominate? The answers he arrived at were water and agriculture, specifically farmland. He bought his first tract of Saskatchewan soil the following year, convinced climate change and a deteriorating geopolitical landscape would wreak havoc on global food supplies in the years to come.
Today, Mr. Andjelic is not only the largest farmland owner in Saskatchewan; nobody in Canada owns more than he does. And in North America, only one other person boasts a larger portfolio: Bill Gates.
From a modest bungalow in the foothills southwest of Calgary, replete with 1970s wood panel walls and motel toiletries in the bathrooms, Mr. Andjelic has amassed more than 225,500 acres of land in Saskatchewan – a property portfolio worth somewhere between $500-million and $700-million – while raising the ire of some farmers and conservationists in the process.
Behind Mr. Andjelic’s buying spree is an outsized bet that Canada’s agricultural sector is presented with a once-in-a-century opportunity. A growing global population and, more importantly, an even faster-growing middle class hungry for protein-rich foods is clashing with a decline in available farmland brought on by urbanization and extreme weather.
Even before Russia’s invasion devastated Ukraine, the so-called bread basket of Europe, international food prices were up 40 per cent from 2019.
As the fifth-largest agricultural producer in the world, Canada is already well positioned to meet that growing demand. Yet Mr. Andjelic and many other people in the sector warn of trouble ahead.
It’s not just that Canada’s creaking rail and port infrastructure is ill-equipped for getting agricultural goods to world markets quickly, let alone handling growing output in the future. Farmers across the country fear the federal government, in its push for a 30-per-cent reduction in fertilizer emissions by 2030 as part of its net-zero climate change plan, risks causing drops in crop yields, total output and revenue.
“Canada has a massive advantage over the rest of the world, but if it’s neglected or hurt, we’re going to completely lose that advantage,” says Mr. Andjelic, as he steers his hulking Dodge Ram Rebel truck along the TransCanada Highway southwest of Regina. “I worry the government is going to do to agriculture what it’s done to the oil and gas sector, but instead of just feeling it at the pumps, with agriculture there’s a human penalty that will be paid for with lives.”
For two weeks each month, Mr. Andjelic crisscrosses the Prairies visiting some of his roughly 250 farmer tenants or speaking with them by phone for hours on end as he drives. In a year, he easily clocks more than 60,000 kilometres on such trips.
Over the summer, The Globe and Mail joined Mr. Andjelic on a 1,500-km road trip across Saskatchewan, talking with producers and others along the way about changes they face.
At 76, Mr. Andjelic, a father of five and grandfather to 12, exhibits the energy of someone decades younger. He regularly hikes the foothills near his home and makes it a point to close the daily exercise rings on his Apple Watch, even if that entails pacing his hotel room until after midnight to get his 10,000 steps in.
Though he came to the agricultural industry without a background in farming, Mr. Andjelic speaks effortlessly with his tenants in their language of crop nutrients, soil moisture levels and weed management. He also shares their exasperation with eastern city dwellers. “All this Hee Haw stuff of farmers in plaid shirts with pitchforks is what those people think farming is,” he complains at one point.
But because Mr. Andjelic was an outsider, it also allowed him to question how farmland was being managed without the burden of tradition. When hiring staff for Andjelic Land, the 10-person Reginabased company that manages his holdings, he prioritizes those without agriculture backgrounds. “I don’t have to hear them say this is how things have been done for 40 years,” he says.
He developed analytics tools specifically geared to farmland investing, with a database 800,000 spreadsheet rows deep on everything from tenant financials, to fertilizer usage and water sample results, not to mention grasshopper outbreaks across all his properties. It’s like Moneyball, the Michael Lewis book about the Oakland Athletics’ embrace of statistics to evaluate players, only for dirt.
But, more than anything, Mr. Andjelic has pursued a strategy of land improvements in which his team strips away old fences, tree lines, rock piles and crumbling farm structures that long characterized the Saskatchewan landscape, enabling farmers to guide their sprawling 90-foot-wide seeders and sprayers for kilometres at a time without slowing down or turning.
By his estimate, Andjelic Lands has spent $25-million on land improvements over the past decade.
“Robert’s land really stands out because there are no trees or old yard sites and tenants gravitate to that because he’s made the land more efficient,” says Harry Sheppard, a realtor who brokered some of Mr. Andjelic’s first land purchases.
Or as Mr. Andjelic puts it himself: “I’ve been in this business only about 11 years, but I’ve turned it on its head.”
The path to farmland baron was far less straight than the rows in Mr. Andjelic’s sprawling fields. Born in Croatia, then part of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, he and his two siblings were smuggled by their mother across the border to Austria in 1958, evading dogs and guards armed with machine guns. They joined Mr. Andjelic’s father, who’d fled earlier, in Winnipeg, where the family began renovating houses.
Mr. Andjelic didn’t speak English, and says he endured taunts from people upset with the influx of Eastern European immigrants. In time, however, the family expanded their burgeoning construction business into larger contracts, such as hydro projects and schools in northern Manitoba. After setting out on his own in the 1980s, Mr. Andjelic launched Sun-X Properties, an industrial warehouse developer in Winnipeg.
There’s a pattern of impeccable timing to Mr. Andjelic’s life in business, and the recession of the early 1990s revealed that. Anticipating a downturn, he built up a cash buffer which left his business relatively unscathed. “The guy left standing is perceived by bankers to be the most stable, and they were coming to me asking me to take buildings off their hands,” he says. “Virtually all of my competition went broke and that’s when I took over the market.”
By the mid-2000s, Sun-X had become the largest industrial landowner in Winnipeg, with more than three million square feet of warehouse space at its peak.
Which is when Mr. Andjelic once again sensed trouble.
In early 2007, a year before the financial crisis hit, Mr. Andjelic sold Sun-X to British Columbia Investment Management Corp., a public-sector pension manager, in a deal then valued at between $100-million and $200-million.
Mr. Andjelic won’t reveal the sale price, only that it was in the “hundreds of millions.” He adds, wryly, “That was a big tax bill.”
Despite his fortune, Mr. Andjelic lives a surprisingly frugal life. He doesn’t collect art or cars – the only other vehicle in his garage besides his truck is a dust-covered 2006 Corvette – and is not above haggling for a $20 discount on a room at a Ramada. “If I was on welfare, I think I could stay within my budget,” he says.
With the cash proceeds from the sale of Sun-X, Mr. Andjelic hunted for a legacy investment for his family. He’d seen first-hand from his commercial tenants how cheap goods from China and low-cost competition from Amazon.com Inc. could decimate a business.
As Mr. Andjelic saw it, farmland would avoid those threats, and Saskatchewan offered some of the most affordable land in the country, thanks to years of strict ownership rules under which only provincial residents could purchase land.
Those rules were eased in 2003, allowing any Canadian resident to buy here. Mr. Andjelic acquired the bulk of his portfolio in the first five years, using satellite imagery to evaluate land and overseeing every aspect of each purchase himself.
When Mr. Andjelic bought his first acres in late 2010, the average price in the province was around $500 an acre, less than half that of Manitoba. Last year the average price hit $2,200, according to Farm Credit Canada, a Crown corporation that provides loans to farmers. Mr. Andjelic pegs the average price of his land at $3,000, because of land improvements and location.
As for debt, he says the loan-to-value ratio on his farmland portfolio is “quite a bit below” 30 per cent.
“I’ve worked with hundreds of farmland investors and I don’t know anyone who is as hands on as Robert,” says Ted Cawkwell, another realtor who has handled transactions for Mr. Andjelic. “He has more of a 30,000-foot view than anyone I’ve ever met.”
Mr. Andjelic’s big-picture perspective can be grim to listen to, as he lays out his bullish thesis for Canadian agriculture.
He’s a strong believer climate change is real, though he won’t be pinned down on its cause. He points to an analysis he did 10 years ago, predicting up to half of America’s agricultural land could eventually be out of commission compared with two decades ago. Just days before our talk, California, which produces more food than any other state, restricted farmers’ access to water due to drought.
Mr. Andjelic sees supply constraints emerging everywhere: In China, where his commodity broker contacts say the country’s wheat inventory is
plagued by spoilage levels vastly higher than officials there admit; in India and other countries that are imposing export restrictions; and, of course, in Ukraine, where despite the opening of some ports, he believes crop output will take years to recover.
Add it together, and Mr. Andjelic predicts a wave of social unrest is on the horizon, driven by food shortages and inflation. “This is how you get a world facing famine and possible riots and how regimes are toppled,” he says. “Just look at the French Revolution, the Russian Revolution, the Arab Spring – it’s always about the cost of food and food availability.”
The solution, he says, is more Canadian-grown food, whether that’s bulk commodities or, better yet, value-added products such as protein extracts from pulse crops – including chickpeas, yellow peas and lentils – as well as processed canola. Over the past decade, he’s worked with companies, investors and banks to promote the plant-based protein industry in the Prairie provinces where, by his count, 25 protein-extraction plants have opened over the past five years.
He also points to the land improvements he carries out, which boost yields per acre. However, as Mr. Andjelic emerged as a significant farmland owner, he faced immediate criticism from some farmers, conservationists and academics about his approach.
Some of it comes down to esthetics. Mr. Sheppard, the realtor on Mr. Andjelic’s early deals, recalls the backlash from some nearby farmers at the sight of land being cleared of trees and old farmyard structures. “Here was this stranger coming in from Winnipeg, erasing the history and landmarks that had been there for 75 years,” Mr. Sheppard says. “Those old yard sites were somebody’s history, but those people are gone, and now it’s productive farmland that was being wasted.”
Other critics blame investors for surging land prices that shut young farmers out of the market.
“We need a new generation of farmers, yet young farmers can’t purchase land,” says Annette Aurélie Desmarais, a professor at the University of Manitoba, who studies food sovereignty and has co-authored several papers on investor “land grabbing” on the Prairies. “Farmers see investors as supercompetitors; they’re up against people like Andjelic who have much deeper pockets than themselves.”
In a coming paper, Ms. Desmarais and her co-authors detail the results of a survey of 400 Prairie grain farmers they conducted about farmland investment and large-scale farm operations, which showed most respondents were apprehensive about the changes. Close to 78 per cent said farmland investors had a negative impact on local communities, and 60 per cent saw a negative impact on local farmland markets.
Yet the responses also seem to be a reaction to the transformation under way in farming. The sector is becoming a more sophisticated, data-driven, bottom-line-oriented business, in which the number of farms in Saskatchewan has fallen steadily from a peak of 140,000 in the 1940s even as output has dramatically increased.
Last year, there were 34,128 farms, according to the latest census of agriculture by Statistics Canada, down by nearly one-third from 2001 (though the agency says the latest census includes a change in the definition of farms that weeds out some hobby farms and makes historical comparisons difficult).
“The market has become cutthroat, pitting neighbour against neighbour,” complained one survey respondent. Added another: “Smaller operators just don’t count. Large very rich players don’t have time of day for smaller operators. No neighbours, only competitors.”
The heavy rain that had been falling for much of the drive across Saskatchewan has slowed as Mr. Andjelic eases his truck along a damp dirt road near the town of Moosomin, by the Manitoba border.
Mr. Andjelic is here to meet with Kristjan Hebert, managing partner of Hebert Grain Ventures, which farms 30,000 acres of canola and other crops. When he returned to run the family farm in 2009 after a five-year stint as an accountant, it was a 3,500-acre operation. He’s expanded by buying land or leasing it from landowners such as Mr. Andjelic.
“Everyone’s always saying that farms are getting bigger because they’re greedy and corporate and I would say … we’ve gotten bigger so we can have better people, and pay more, and so we can invest in technology to farm every acre as good as the first acre,” Mr. Hebert says. “If you run a farm like a way of life, it’s actually a pretty bad business, but if you run it like a business, it’s a pretty good way of life.”
As the two men sit down, wheat prices have retreated from the spike brought on by the Russian invasion, but remain high. “The whole world is probably paying more attention to agriculture now than it has in 70 years,” Mr. Hebert says.
Like many Canadian farmers, Mr. Hebert took advantage of elevated prices to plant more acres of wheat. The latest wheat harvest estimates from Statistics Canada suggest production this year will be 13 per cent higher than the five-year average.
Yet he and many others in the sector say Canada’s transportation infrastructure is not able to keep pace.
“As long as Mother Nature co-operates, Canada can produce as much grain as we always have and more, but we need to ensure we can get that to the world,” he says. “We can’t have railway disruptions and strikes; we can’t have the Port of Vancouver not loading cars; we can’t have container ships not able to get into port. That’s all out of farmers’ control.”
In the absence of progress on a long-term national transportation strategy, some leaders have taken things into their own hands.
In Regina, Murad Al-Katib, founder and chief executive of AGT Food and Ingredients Inc., a global commodity trading firm and processor of pulse crops that has 40 processing facilities worldwide, points to the $150-million railway container terminal he built next door to his first facility. It’s part of a series of deals AGT, backed by Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd., undertook to assemble the largest short-line railway in Western Canada, capable of moving agricultural goods quickly from farms to ports in Vancouver and Prince Rupert.
Far more will need to be done if Canada is to live up to its potential. Mr. Al-Katib estimates gains from technology, crop innovations and irrigation could boost Canada’s annual principal field crop production significantly in the years to come. Yet trade corridors are already congested.
“We’re a country of 35 million with the productive capacity to feed billions of people,” he says. “But that’s contingent on our ability to trade with the world.”
Back at Mr. Hebert’s farm, the conversation soon turns to the federal government’s push to reduce emissions from farmers using fertilizers. Earlier this year, Agriculture Canada released a proposal to cut fertilizer-related emissions by 30 per cent within eight years. Ottawa insists the cuts will be voluntary, but the plan has renewed feelings that eastern politicians take the work farmers do for granted.
Much of the frustration lies in the fact farmers have already taken significant steps to reduce fertilizer use, if only for their bottom lines. As one farmer griped to Mr. Andjelic during a phone call: “No one is going to put on more fertilizer than they need. Farmers are tight-asses.”
Many farmers already operate sprayers with variable nozzles connected to GPS applications that automatically turn off if going over land that’s already been sprayed. Hebert conducts soil tests every four acres to fine-tune how much fertilizer is needed.
And nearly 80 per cent of Saskatchewan farmers now practice zero-till farming – they don’t plow fields before sowing crops. That helps prevent soil erosion, keeps carbon in the ground and reduces the need for fertilizer.
But farmers also fear if Ottawa makes its 30-percent emissions cut mandatory, it would require a sharp drop in fertilizer usage, slashing how much food they can produce. The uncertainty has farmers on edge.
“The only risk in agriculture that actually scares me is bad policy,” Mr. Hebert says. “I can deal with what mother nature throws at me, but policy is something that’s really tough to hedge against.”
There are signs the message is getting through.
“We believe there’s an opportunity to reduce nitrous oxide emissions by employing different methods,” said Kody Blois, chair of the House of Commons agriculture committee, in an interview. “However, we are in a period right now with the war in Ukraine that Canadian agriculture is needed more than ever.”
Mr. Blois says it’s a “misconception” Ottawa plans to ban certain amounts of fertilizer, and blames a “communications gap” on the federal Liberals having no seats in Saskatchewan.
But if voluntary emissions reductions fail, would Ottawa impose mandatory ones? “That’s ultimately a decision for government to make,” he says. “What I can say, as a member of Parliament that does not sit in the Privy Council, now is not the time to be compromising Canada’s food security.”
For Mr. Andjelic, the proof will be in the federal government’s actions: “If these guys in Ottawa think they’re going to tell farmers, who know their land, how to implement a fertilizer cut, it’s insulting.”
Since Mr. Andjelic’s first foray into Saskatchewan farmland, more investors have poured in, including, for a time, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. The fund bought 120,000 acres in 2013, but sold its holdings four years later after the province brought in rules banning institutional investors from buying farmland. CPPIB also sold its U.S. farmland holdings that year to Cascade Investment LLC, a company controlled by Mr. Gates.
Mr. Andjelic says he has no interest in selling and is doing due diligence to acquire farmland in Alberta and Manitoba. He’s also structured his estate in a way that discourages family members from selling their share of the land.
That’s not to say he doesn’t have an exit strategy.
He’s geared his portfolio toward use by Hutterites, a Christian sect that embraces communal land ownership. As Hutterite colonies grow, they split to create new ones that typically buy farmland in the process, and Mr. Andjelic sees that adding to demand over the next 10 years.
“I don’t have an exit strategy because I want to sell, but in case I’m ever forced to sell,” he says. “I always run my businesses with options a, b, c, d, up to k, so that no matter what’s thrown at me, I’m ready for it.”
For now, the opportunities are too enticing to pass up, he says, from the potential for Saskatchewan to be the world’s top producer of plant-based proteins, to the northern expansion of crops such as corn and soybeans as climate change extends the province’s growing season.
Mr. Andjelic is even turning his attention to that other Canadian commodity the world is desperately short of: water.
“There will be countries where the bulk of the population will have to move to areas with water,” he says. “I’m starting to look at opportunities to monetize that. But there’s only 24 hours in a day, and I’m only one guy.”

Full text: Thousands of people in Alberta’s Bow Valley region are being left without a family doctor, in the latest side effect of a housing crisis that has priced out families and made homes scarce.
Kendra Barrick, president and co-chair of the Bow Valley Primary Care Network, said the housing situation in Canmore, where a shortage has increased the cost of buying and renting, has challenged the agency’s recruitment and retention of staff.
“Some physicians have moved to Calgary or joined central practices where it’s more affordable because of just the cost of running a solo practice or a small practice,” Dr. Barrick said.
In the past six months, two more doctors retired from the Ridgeview Medical Centre where Dr. Barrick practices, causing the clinic to close most of its walk-in clinic availability.
“We’re actually giving those unattached patients a disservice if they are suffering.”
Housing has long been an issue in Canmore, a former mining town of about 16,000 about an hour’s drive east of Calgary. A combination of a seasonal workforce, vacation properties and several failed attempts at building new housing have pushed up prices and squeezed supply. This was exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which prompted some remote workers to relocate to a place at the foot of the Rocky Mountains.
Town officials and housing providers have said the crisis has rippled throughout the community, not only making it difficult to recruit doctors, but also exacerbating a staffing shortage and making it next to impossible for some families to remain in the community.
Attempts to build new housing – which many say is what Canmore needs to alleviate the problem – have been blocked by litigation and local opposition that has largely focused on the impact of development on wildlife and increased building density.
“It’s really grim,” said Joanna McCallum, a longtime Canmore town councillor who also sits on the board of Bow Valley Regional Housing. “The market in Canmore is broken and it has been broken for a long time.”
Ms. McCallum added that residents of the hospitality town are forced to compete with the rest of the world for a family home: “Everybody can outbid a local because of what our wages look like.”
Canmore currently has the highest cost of living in the province, with a living wage double Calgary’s, at $37.40 an hour for a two-income family, according to the Alberta Living Wage Network.
The average cost of a single family home in the town in 2021 was $1.5-million, more than double Calgary, and rivals the country’s most expensive real-estate markets.
The rental vacancy rate is 1 per cent, and zero for affordable housing.
Graham McDowell, a postdoctoral associate at the University of Calgary who leads a project called the Canadian Mountain Assessment in Canmore, moved from Vancouver last year and has been looking for a home for his family for the past six months.
They are fortunate to be in a position to afford a home in the town’s market, but Mr. McDowell said they felt stressed to move quickly so they wouldn’t get priced out.
“You start to think that X amount of dollars is just a reasonable amount to pay for a home and then you actually step back and you run the numbers,” he said.
“The financial reality is actually quite daunting.”
After the Bank of Canada increased the interest rate in July, the market has cooled down somewhat, but that has not solved the problem, according to Canmore realtor Dan Sparks.
“We’re a very small market. This is an extremely small community with very low inventory,” Mr. Sparks said.
Mr. Sparks has nearly 20 years of experience in real estate in the town and previously sat on the board for the Canmore Community Housing Corp., which he said has struggled with properly addressing the middle class’s needs.
The CCH runs an affordable housing program, for which residents qualify by meeting certain residency and incomecap requirements. The agency is currently sitting at a 0-per-cent vacancy rate with a waitlist of more than 170 people.
Mr. Sparks said the town needs to develop more housing, but he understands that doing so is contentious.
“Certainly, it would be wonderful to not have more development to have maintained this idyllic little mountain town, but the cost of that is a loss of families who simply can’t afford to be here,” he said.
Ms. McCallum said the problem is not that housing isn’t being built, but that the right kind isn’t being developed.
Canmore’s residential zoning is split into three categories: residential for standard housing that cannot be rented out short term; visitor accommodation for short-term rentals under 28 days, such as Airbnb; and tourist homes that are used for full- and part-time rentals.
Out-of-town buyers seeking second homes are adding pressure to the market.
While Banff National Park caps town residency and restricts it to only those who work in the park, Canmore does not have those same restrictions.
Mr. Sparks said that some residents worry about the town becoming a busy resort municipality like Whistler or Banff. However, tourist revenue is what the town is asking for.
Canmore Mayor Sean Krausert said the town, along with Banff and Jasper, asked the Alberta government for resort municipality status, like Whistler has. The designation would recognize the town’s tourism based economy and the need for additional revenue tools, such as a resort fee or tax to visitors.
“This does not directly deal with housing, but the need to use our resources for significant tourism related infrastructure certainly impacts our ability to use those resources to address housing,” Mr. Krausert said.
The mayor said the town is also looking to address the housing crisis through the newly approved strategic plan for 2023 to 2026, and the council hopes to develop more affordable housing through CCH. He also wants the province, which is responsible for social housing, to help address the crisis.
Alberta’s Minister of Seniors and Housing, Josephine Pon, was not available for an interview, but said in a statement that the ministry has worked with Bow Valley Regional Housing, the Town of Canmore and the CCH to “develop a fulsome understanding of the housing need in Canmore and identify local partnership opportunities to develop possible options.”
Councillor Tanya Foubert, who was born and raised in Canmore and has lived in a variety of affordable housing, said that the town is geographically constrained and development has been contentious.
“I go to places, other communities in Alberta, and growth is celebrated. It’s encouraged, it’s economic development, it’s new residents,” Ms. Foubert said. “And here it’s not necessarily met with enthusiasm all the time.”
Most of the housing being developed right now is commercial visitor accommodation, she said, because future residential land is currently caught up in litigation.
Last summer, Three Sisters Mountain Village Properties Ltd., which owns the vast majority of the land available for all development in Canmore, including 665 acres in their Smith Creek and Three Sisters Village development sites, took the Town of Canmore to court before the Alberta Land and Property Rights Tribunal.
In 2017, town council had asked Three Sisters to provide a full area structure plan for both sites, which cost the company more than $11-million over three years to prepare. The company presented its plans last December, 2020, where they were heard by the public and ultimately rejected by town council the following spring.
Opponents argued the massive proposal would endanger wildlife and warned that the sudden increase in density from new buildings and tourism would hurt the community.
The company appealed the council’s decision to the land tribunal, which in May ordered the town to adopt the Smith Creek and Three Sisters Village plans “as submitted.” Town council has filed an appeal of that decision.
Chris Ollenberger, the director of strategy and development for Three Sisters, said both plans had a “spectrum of housing” and would create a minimum of about 250 rental units and 3,500 housing units, with 10 per cent going to the affordable housing program.
The Town of Canmore itself has a large area of land through existing residential zoning for future housing, of which councillors Ms. Foubert and Ms. McCallum said increased density could help address the town’s need for more housing and climate goals.
However, Ms. Foubert said Canmore needs the funding and partnership from the provincial and federal governments to make this plan a success.
“We have to use the land we have to the best. But all the time we take planning, the market – everything – increases in price and people leave our communities,” she said.
“There are no short-term fixes that are within reach.”

BoC rate hike expected to deepen downturn in real estate

Full text: Canada’s real estate slump is about to deepen, as the rising cost of borrowing pushes more buyers out of the market, economists predict.
In announcing its latest interest-rate hike on Wednesday – to 3.25 per cent from 2.5 per cent – the Bank of Canada said the overnight lending rate will need to go even higher to dampen inflation.
Since the central bank started lifting interest rates from the low of 0.25 per cent in March, home sales have plunged along with home prices.
“We see the downturn intensifying and spreading as buyers take a wait-and-see approach while ascertaining the impact of higher lending rates,” said Robert Hogue, assistant chief economist with Royal Bank of Canada.
So far this year, home prices have recorded their sharpest five-month drop since the global financial crisis in 2009. The national home price index is down 6 per cent from its peak in February. The index is the industry’s preferred measure of home prices because it adjusts for volatility and excludes the high end of the market.
In the Toronto region, the home price index declined nearly 16 per cent from March to August, with some of the city’s suburbs losing more than 20 per cent.
Mr. Hogue said the country’s priciest real estate markets, which include the Toronto suburbs, were the most vulnerable to declines because of their unaffordability and their previous astounding price increases.
In the first two years of the pandemic, the typical home price in Durham region, east of the city, rose nearly 90 per cent, while prices climbed nearly 70 per cent in Halton, to the west.
These suburbs are now leading the way down with typical Durham home prices falling 21 per cent or $249,300 over the past five months, according to the local real estate board. Prices in Halton have dropped by 23 per cent or $337,700 over the past six months.
After a slow summer in which sales fell below prepandemic levels in some parts of the country and homes lost value, realtors were hoping the market had reached bottom.
But economists say home prices will continue downward. Bank of Montreal economists said the central bank’s guidance solidified their view that the national home price index could fall by 20 per cent from the peak earlier in the year to the bottom sometime next year.
Borrowers will soon pay more in interest. It’s just a matter of when. Most holders of variable rate mortgages have static monthly payments, but they will immediately see a higher share go toward interest rather than paying down principal. People with fixed-rate mortgages will pay a higher monthly amount when they renew them. Homeowners with a home equity line of credit will immediately pay a higher interest rate on their loan.
It will also continue to be harder for would-be buyers to qualify for a mortgage, and they will be able to get less. “Borrowing power is going to be reduced once again,” said Don Scott, chief executive officer of mortgage brokerage Frank Mortgage.
Wednesday’s interest-rate hike will make the mortgage stress test harder. Under federal bank rules, borrowers must prove they can make their monthly mortgage payments at an interest rate that is at least two percentage points higher than their actual rate.
According to Mr. Scott, the cheapest variable-rate mortgages may soon be 4.35 per cent and the lowest five-year fixed mortgage rate will top 5 per cent. That means borrowers will have to prove they can cover their payments with an interest rate at 6.35 per cent and 7 per cent, respectively.
And this in turn means wouldbe homebuyers will not be able to spend as much. It will be particularly hard for first-time homebuyers, said Laura Martin, chief operating officer of mortgage brokerage Matrix Mortgage Global.
Ms. Martin said repeat buyers, however, have benefited “massively” from the runup in prices over the past four years, and will be able to use their equity from any sale to help with another purchase.

Development plan fuels debate about protecting Calgary’s heritage buildings: Stephen Avenue Quarter would include the tallest tower in Western Canada, and changes or demolition of a number of historic sites in the area

Full text: A proposal for a large mixed-use development in downtown Calgary that would include the tallest building in Western Canada could transform a stretch of the city’s historic Stephen Avenue but it has prompted concerns from a local advocacy group over what it describes as the dismantling of heritage sites in the area.
Real estate firm Triovest has submitted a permit application to the city for a project called the Stephen Avenue Quarter.
The development would include three towers, including one standing 66-storeys high, of housing, shops, office spaces, residential units and a hotel over an area that would cover nearly a square block.
The current plan would result in changes or the complete demolition of a number of historic buildings in and around the area of the popular Stephen Avenue, which is lined with shops, restaurants and bars, and which has undergone redevelopment in recent years to be more pedestrian-friendly. The street was named a national historic site 20 years ago.
No decision on the plan has been made, although Triovest says news on the development will be coming in the next two weeks.
In some cases, such as the old Bank of Montreal building on the west end of the block, façades of the structures would be maintained while the internal spaces would be gutted and replaced. This type of design has been implemented before into some nearby buildings, such as the Hyatt Regency, which retains the façade of the original Lineham Block building from 1886. On the eastern portion of the plan’s perimeter, however, many of the buildings would be completely demolished.
“In a city that hasn’t necessarily been great at retaining their heritage structures, this would be a huge loss,” said Chris Edwards, president and co-founder of the Calgary Heritage Initiative Society, one of the leading groups raising noise about the proposal.
Since some of the buildings identified for alteration or demolition by Triovest are designated as protected heritage sites, Mr. Edwards argues the redevelopment of those sites could set a worrying precedent for similar sites across the province, as the city would have to either bypass or revoke those designations in order to approve the construction of the proposed complex.
“If this is looking at stripping seven heritage designations at once, just because a developer would prefer that goes away, in my opinion, that would destroy the whole heritage designation system, not only in Calgary, but in Alberta,” Mr. Edwards said.
“What kind of effect would that have on all the other municipalities if they look at Calgary stripping entire blocks of designation away?” Stephen Avenue, where office towers such as Bankers Hall are mixed with century-old sandstone buildings including the city’s flagship Hudson’s Bay Co. store, was designated a national historic site in 2002.
The description in Parks Canada’s registry of historic sites notes that the street’s “distinctive character,” as a late 1800s streetscape, tells a story of Prairie urban development in a city built around a railway and gridiron planning. Parks Canada also says Stephen Avenue demonstrates the “central role that such retail streets have played, and continue to play, in the Canadian urban experience.”
Ryan Schott, vice-president of marketing and communications at Triovest, said the company’s plans would retain the essence of the buildings’ original design, but did not address whether the company would ask the city to revoke heritage designations.
“Triovest’s approach to Stephen Avenue is to retain maximum heritage value while enhancing the economic, social and cultural vitality of this portion of the commercial downtown core,” Mr. Schott said in an e-mail.
“The new development integrates the historic buildings into its design, honouring their original shape, form, layout and boundaries, and ensures that the look, feel and function of the avenue and street-level commerce remain. In cases where significant heritage fabric exists, the project team is exploring opportunities to retain more than just the façades, including the massing [shape and form], the spatial configuration, and the finishes of existing heritage buildings.”
Mr. Edwards of the heritage group also raised the potential disruptive effects of multiyear construction on the local economy, and contended that the addition of more office space, which is already controversial because of a high number of vacant offices in Calgary’s core, is an indicator of poor judgment by the developers. In response, Mr. Schott reiterated that Stephen Avenue Quarter is designed to be a “truly mixeduse, community-focused campus.”
Ward 7 councillor Terry Wong, who came into office last October, said he hears the concerns of people like Mr. Edwards, but emphasized a need for more nuanced conversation in the balance between heritage sites and development.
“One of the important parts of Calgary is its rich history and heritage architecture.
Having said that, the other aspect of what’s important for Calgary is its growth, development and a revitalized vitality for the downtown core, so maintaining a balance between the two is critical,” Mr. Wong said.
Calgary Mayor Jyoti Gondek, who had worked as a member of Calgary’s planning commission and later as a councillor of Ward 3 before taking the top office last October, echoed Mr. Wong’s sentiments, adding the ideal result of any redevelopment is to respect the history of a building while allowing the site to be reimagined for modern needs.
Ms. Gondek pointed to the Telus Sky Building – another skyscraper along Stephen Avenue, which finished construction in 2019 – as an example of how multiuse buildings that displace existing architecture can be an enhancement to an area, and cites New York as a model for how cities can maintain façades of old buildings while still developing new structure on top.
“I think we became incredibly entrenched in what will work and what will not work when it comes to imagining a downtown and when it comes to imagining commercial real estate,” Ms. Gondek said, pushing back against the idea that city design is a black-or-white issue, where planners either honour old structures or demolish them without regard for their history. “We forgot that there is a whole new opportunity with a generation of people that don’t share those beliefs. There’s a lot of people right now that are interested in doing some pretty innovative things, and they’ll take the space that’s available and accommodate that space to meet their needs.”

Full text: 1522 Concession 10, South Nottawasaga Rd.
CLEARVIEW, ONT.
Asking Price: $3,650,000 Taxes: $5,801.02 (2022) Lot Size: 91 acres Agents: James Warren, Alex Obradovich, Cheryl MacLaurin, Rob McAleer, Chestnut Park Real Estate Ltd.
THE BACKSTORY Douglas and Patricia King were avid skiers in the early 1990s when they began to think about purchasing property near the ski hills of Ontario.
“It seemed everyone we knew had a cabin for skiing,” Ms. King says.
She recalls spending one weekend at a chalet so cramped that some family members had to sleep on the floor. After that, they ramped up their search for a more comfortable retreat.
They soon found a 91-acre farm with a Victorian-era farmhouse.
“I first saw it in January and it was up to the window sill in snow,” Ms. King says.
The Kings had lived in London for several years and gained an appreciation for historic homes and weekends in the country. They were drawn to the farm’s position high on the Niagara escarpment with views over the surrounding fields. It was also close to the slopes, with Osler Bluff Ski Club, Beaver Valley Ski Club, Devil’s Glen Country Club and Blue Mountain Ski Resort nearby.
When ski season was over, they would head to the greens of Mad River Golf Club, a short drive away.
Ms. King says the circa 1882 red-brick house was small and typical of its era, with a summer kitchen and a front porch.
“It had a tiny porch when we bought it – you could barely get two chairs on it,” Ms. King recalls.
The couple spent a couple of years using the farmhouse as a weekend retreat with their three sons before they decided to renovate.
The Kings hired local architect Lloyd Hunt to design an addition that would give the family more space while preserving the original farmhouse.
THE HOUSE TODAY w The expanded house provides 5,294 square feet of living space with five bedrooms and four bathrooms.
The principal rooms have been opened up to provide lots of wheelchair accessible space for gathering and entertaining. The home has a great room with bay windows, a large kitchen with double-sided fireplace and a billiards room.
It was important to the Kings that the proportions of the addition remain in keeping with the old farmhouse while adding windows that took advantage of the views.
“We also wanted it to mirror the original house,” Mr. King says. “We looked for red brick that would match exactly.”
Their time in England influenced their design choices, the Kings say.
Ms. King bought pieces of antique furniture during the family’s time there, and they found a new home at the country property.
“I wanted it to be comfortable and informal and colourful,” she says.
The couple had an old cast iron stove preserved as a reminder of the home’s heritage. Today, the antique stove is mostly used as a sideboard, Mr. King says.
Over the years, the Kings had many holiday gatherings for their extended family.
For one large party, they hired the chef and his crew from the legendary Webers’ hamburger spot to fire up the grill.
Outside, the Kings had the tiny porch replaced with a wraparound verandah.
There’s also a bank barn dating to the 1880s.
“We had it restored by local Mennonites, who came in a buggy,” Mr. King says.
THE BEST FEATURE Protected land belonging to the Bruce Trail Conservancy abuts the property.
The farm is comprised of approximately 65 acres of farmed canola fields, 15 acres of forest and 10 acres of land for the house and outbuildings. There’s a small apple orchard, but the Kings buy most of their vegetables from neighbouring farms.
Over the years, the couple has seen the population and attractions of Collingwood, Ont., explode. In the small communities of Clearview and Duntroon, the surroundings are more bucolic.
“It’s still very rural,” Ms. King says.

More Calgary property investors are turning to short-term rentals: The option offers the prospect of greater revenue than long-term tenancies because of the higher turnover

Full text: A growing number of property investors in Calgary are turning to short-term rentals despite increased demand for long-term tenancies.
The number of short-term rental listings for entire units available on Airbnb and Vrbo was 8 per cent higher between January and July of this year than in 2019, according to AirDNA, a U.S.-based analytics provider for the short-term rental industry.
With a monthly average of 2,472 listings, entire units represented about 80 per cent of all listings during that time period, up from 60 per cent prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the firm’s data.
At the same time, the added pressure of higher interest rates and inflation on potential buyers has created a tight rental market in Calgary, said Ray Wong, vicepresident of data operations at Altus Group.
Interest rates “are pushing away those people that want to purchase and no longer can, causing more tightness and pushing rents higher in the traditional rental market,” Mr. Wong said.
In the first quarter of 2022, Altus Group recorded a rental vacancy rate of 2.31 per cent in Calgary, down from 5.1 per cent in 2021 and 6.6 per cent in 2020, while rental rates have steadily increased.
In July, the average rent of a one-bedroom unit in Calgary was 27 per cent higher than a year earlier, the second largest increase recorded in Rentals.ca’s national rent ranking.
As Calgary’s economy recovers, this situation is expected to continue. “Calgary is benefiting from the resurgence in oil prices,” Mr. Wong said. “That’s causing a push for some of the rentals in the downtown area.”
Yet, investors appear to be gravitating toward short-term rentals rather than taking on long-term tenants. Mr. Wong notes that short-term rentals offer the prospect of higher revenue than long-term rentals because of the higher turnover.
Duncan Haldane, co-owner of Your Key, a short-term rental management company based in Calgary, said short-term rentals offer property owners a higher rate of return, among other benefits, than long-term rentals.
“It is a way to create more value from their property,” he said.
“When you look at a short-term rental, the economics are better than if you compare it to a longterm rental.”
The AirDNA data show that entire units listed on Airbnb and Vrbo brought in an average of $2,000 a month during the first seven months of the year, despite being occupied half of the time they were available – a 40per-cent increase from 2019.
The average rent for units in the rental listing website RentFaster was about $1,700 over the same period.
In July, Airbnb listed Calgary as one of the most popular markets for long-term stays in Canada, alongside Toronto, Vancouver, Montreal and Victoria.
While July is the busiest month in Calgary’s short-term rental market, AirDNA data show that long-term stays are changing seasonality trends.
During the first seven months of this year, the monthly number of nights booked in entire units has been roughly 10 per cent higher than in 2019.
Short-term rental services have also faced criticism for disrupting local housing markets by reducing supply and driving up rents.
Researchers at McGill University published a study in 2019 that found Airbnb had removed 31,000 homes from the Canadian rental market. Airbnb has denied its service has a negative effect on the traditional rental market and said it works with local governments to follow regulations designed to control short-term rentals.
While municipal governments in Vancouver, Victoria, Ottawa and Toronto require all properties listed be the owner’s principal residence, effectively banning entire units from becoming available in the short-term rental market and affecting renters, Calgary is comparatively permissive.
In 2020, the City of Calgary implemented a business licence requirement for short term-rentals to ensure property owners follow regulations such as limits on the number of guests and recordkeeping.
Lindsay Tedds, an associate professor of economics at the University of Calgary’s School of Public Policy, said policies and regulations adopted by local governments should also consider the role platforms play in driving both the demand and supply of short-term accommodations.
Dr. Tedds said cities should adopt a “co-regulation” model, working together with shortterm rental companies to ensure property owners are following local rules – rather than what she describes as a “hammer of Thor” approach that could stifle the market.
“The big issue is [that] the platform is not just an agnostic player,” Dr. Tedds said.
“It wants more and more ‘listers,’ and more and more shortterm renters. And so it’s always making sure that from their perspective there are sufficient rentals of sufficient type in certain areas, and then they want to drive certain renters to them.”
Still, Dr. Tedds rejects the idea that short-term accommodations in Calgary are undermining the traditional market, as according to her team’s research, between 2017 and 2021 the average number of short-term rentals available in Calgary has remained flat at about 2,500 units a month, including both entire units and shared accommodations.
“We’re not seeing this being a hollowing-out of the rental market,” she explains. “The tightness of the rental market cannot be subscribed to Airbnb, it’s a function of poor housing policy for 20, 30 years.”

Full text: DONE DEAL 13503 86 Ave., Edmonton LAURIER HEIGHTS Asking price: $1.995-million (April, 2022) Selling price: $1.9-million (May, 2022) Taxes: $17,596 (2021) Days on the market: 32 Listing agents: Clare Packer and Judy Clare-Packer, Re/Max Excellence THE ACTION This custom bungalow overlooking the North Saskatchewan River was beyond the budget of most Edmonton buyers and it was promoted further afield, including in Vancouver and Toronto. There were six in-person tours and in the end it was a local resident who came forward with a $1.9-million bid a month after the property hit the market.
“You’d typically expect a house in that price tier to take several months to sell,” said agent Clare Packer. “You rarely you see luxury bungalows of this nature, because they’re really expensive to build per square foot.”
WHAT THEY GOT This 11-year-old house on a 111- by 131-foot corner lot was designed by a previous owner, an engineer who embraced sustainable building practices, such as insulated concrete forms, heat-recovery ventilation systems and heated concrete flooring.
Clerestory windows and vaulted wood ceilings add a dramatic look to the eat-in kitchen and sunken living room. The kitchen also has a long island and sliding doors to a wide deck. There is a fireplace in the living room.
The home also has two dens.
All three bedrooms have ensuite bathrooms and there are additional stand-alone bathrooms on each level. The basement provides a recreation room and guest bedroom, as well as direct access into the garage.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “It’s an architecturally designed home with a very impressive floor plan and luxurious, high-end finishes,” Ms. Packer said. “It was full-height, ICF construction, which is one of the most costly methods to build a house, but it’s extremely energy efficient with longevity in mind.”
The outdoor space was also striking. “They had about a quarter-million dollars worth of professional landscaping done, so there was a Brazilian hardwood deck and retaining walls. It was really gorgeous,” Ms. Packer said.

Pressure ramps up to end ban on men leaving Ukraine

Full text: Ukraine’s ban on adult men leaving the country so they will be available for military service is facing growing criticism and legal challenges as the war drags on and the country’s economy falters.
Several petitions have been launched calling on the government to overturn the measure, and a group of lawyers has filed lawsuits arguing that it violates the constitution.
One lawyer has also asked the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Michelle Bachelet, to push Kyiv to drop the rule.
“No other country does this,” said Alexander Gumirov, who sent a letter to Ms. Bachelet asking her to intervene. “Not even Russia who kills us. Now we ended up in the situation that we are fighting in the country for liberty and we are less liberal than the country which is attacking us.”
The UN commission has yet to respond to the letter but has urged Ukraine to show compassion to those seeking to flee.
President Volodymyr Zelensky announced the ban – which applies to men between the ages of 18 and 60 – when he introduced martial law on Feb. 24.
At the time he said the move was necessary “in order to ensure the defence of the state, maintaining combat and mobilization readiness.”
It has remained in force, although there are several exemptions, including for men who have a medical condition, international students, single fathers and those caring for three or more children.
Most observers acknowledge that Ukraine has a right to mobilize as many people as possible to fend off the Russians, including through conscription. But as the war moves into its seventh month and jobs become scarce, forcing almost all men to remain in the country has become harder to justify.
Critics say the army doesn’t want men who are unfit or unwilling to fight. Therefore, they add, it makes little sense to prohibit millions of unemployed men from going abroad to find work that would support their families and contribute financially to the country.
There are also fears that by compelling men to stay, Kyiv is simply creating targets for Russian soldiers in occupied territories.
Research by political scientist Adam Jones has found that conquering forces typically view civilian men between the ages of 15 and 55 as a danger. Of the 458 people killed during Russia’s occupation of the Kyiv suburb of Bucha last March, 366 were men. There have also been reports that Russian soldiers have forced Ukrainian men to fight on the front lines.
The ban “contradicts the constitution and all the international laws which Ukraine has adopted and ratified,” said Dmytro Busanov, a lawyer in Kyiv who is part of the group pursuing a legal challenge.
He pointed to Article 33 of the constitution, which gives people “the right to freely leave the territory of Ukraine, with the exception of restrictions established by law.”
Mr. Busanov said parliament has not enshrined the requirement into law and instead introduced it as a cabinet decree. “The problem is that if there is a limitation of the constitution it should be limited by law and there is no law which says that men under such condition are prohibited from leaving the country.”
Although he normally practises real estate law, Mr. Busanov became so incensed by the ban that he took two cases on a pro bono basis to fight it. His clients are a couple of men in their 40s who moved to central Ukraine from Donetsk and Mariupol because of the fighting there. Now they can’t find work and both have wives and two children to support.
“We need a judge in Ukraine who will make a just decision,” Mr. Busanov said. In the meantime, he’s considering filing an application with the European Court of Human Rights.
He and others say the country’s worsening economy has made many men increasingly desperate to leave. A growing number are paying bribes or turning to dozens of online services that promise to get men across the border for about US$1,500.
Oksana Druchynina’s husband, Denys, took an even riskier route.
They used to live in Molochansk, near Zaporizhzhia, and both worked at the Mennonite Centre, which is supported by a Canadian charity. When Russian troops occupied the city in late February, the family headed to Kyiv. Ms. Druchynina and their three children went on to Abbotsford, B.C., while Mr. Druchynina, 27, moved to western Ukraine.
He tried to get out by applying for an exemption. When that failed, he decided to try his luck with the Russians.
He travelled to southern Ukraine, talked his way past Russian checkpoints and got into Crimea.
From there he spent four days on a bus through Russia to the border with Latvia, then waited almost two days to cross. He eventually made it to Poland, where he is waiting for a Canadian visa.
He told his wife that three-quarters of the people on the bus were men from Ukraine.
“I understand that they don’t want all the men to leave the country,” Ms. Druchynina said.
“But on the other hand, they don’t need men to fight who don’t want to fight.”
Mr. Zelensky has defended the ban and dismissed the criticism.
In response to a petition that gathered 27,000 signatures, he said: “Can we show this petition to parents who lost their sons to defend the country?” He has also pointed to a section of the constitution that says freedom of movement can be restricted under martial law.
The government has expanded some exemptions. Since May, men can go abroad for as many as 30 days if they serve as volunteer drivers delivering humanitarian aid. On Sept. 1, entrepreneurs will be able to exit for a week, but they must put down a deposit of about $7,000. And last Saturday, Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said merchant sailors can cross the border if they receive approval from their local military administrative body.
Some parliamentarians want the government to go further. Heorhii Mazurashu, who belongs to Mr. Zelensky’s Servant of the People party, has proposed several bills to ease the restrictions but has found little support among his colleagues because the issue is too sensitive.
“The main thing is that if we finally moved from emotional decisions … it would be for the benefit of ordinary citizens, the economy, and therefore the defence capability and the country as a whole,” he said.

Full text: A hot rental market across Canada is squeezing postsecondary students, with universities and private companies trying to meet growing demand with a mini-boom in residence building.
Universities have been adding new residence spaces, with several new buildings either ready to open or under construction at Canadian campuses.
It’s one of the few levers that schools have to address the broader issue of rising rents and falling vacancy rates that are contributing to increasing costs for students. But residences take years to build and with most beds aimed at those in first year, much of the housing available to students off campus is dependent on dynamics in the private rental market.
More than 21,000 new residence spaces will be added to Canada’s 24 largest student markets by 2025, according to a report from real estate consultants Cushman & Wakefield. That would mean a 15-per-cent boost to the 145,000 residence beds available in those markets, the report said. But the report suggests that the need for new units could still outstrip supply, particularly if international enrolments continue to grow.
It’s not just big cities where the issue is pressing.
The University of Prince Edward Island last week suggested that students who haven’t yet secured accommodation should not travel to the province and may want to consider deferring enrolment for a term.
FROM B1 UPEI said its residence wait list was more than 400 people, with a new building not expected to be ready until 2023. The university said the wait list was longer than usual partly because more upper-year students have opted to stay in residence, a knock-on effect of a tight rental market. The university appealed to the community to make rooms available for students, but it may not be enough.
Administrators made the same pitch to local residents in Kelowna, B.C., where the University of British Columbia Okanagan campus is located. The university said it was turning to its neighbours and asking for help, as it urged people to rent out their vacant rooms, and a similar appeal went out from the University of Calgary students’ union.
McMaster University in Hamilton has had residence wait lists in the range of 100 to 600 students in recent years, according to associate vice-president and dean of students Sean Van Koughnett. It is one of the few universities of its size that doesn’t offer a guaranteed place in residence to first-year students.
The university is in the process of building two new residences in conjunction with a private company, Knightstone Capital, one with more than 600 beds aimed at graduate students and located a few kilometres from campus, and a second with more than 1,300 beds adjacent to campus.
The new buildings will bring the university’s residence offerings to about 6,000, on a campus with more than 36,000 full-time students.
The attraction for private companies to build residences is that, as Cushman & Wakefield put it, student housing offers superior returns compared with other asset classes. Students are open to renting smaller spaces, they tend to be less risky as tenants because their parents often act as guarantors, and predictable turnover is baked into the academic calendar, allowing more opportunities to raise rents, according to the consultants.
Mr. Van Koughnett said expanding residences is one way universities can respond to the tightening housing situation.
“I think universities have an even greater role to play in providing housing for students than before,” he said.
He said that in Hamilton he has heard that students who would normally leave the off-campus student housing market upon graduation are staying put, because housing is scarce and prices have risen beyond what they can afford. The result is even more pressure on limited student housing, he said.
The university also sees other advantages to having students in residence.
McMaster’s statistics show that students who lived in residence in first year have a higher retention rate, a graduation rate about 10 per cent higher and a grade-point average of 0.3 to 0.5 points higher than those who lived off campus in their first year.
The Canadian Federation of Students says students are facing a national housing crisis.
One of the issues in the student rental market has been the rapid expansion of international student enrolment, with nearly 450,000 study permits issued in 2021.
Jessica Look, president of the Ontario Undergraduate Student Alliance, said the expansion of international student places has not come with a proportional investment in housing. And with more students wanting to live near campus this year as pandemic restrictions are lifted, students are struggling to find something affordable at a reasonable distance, she said.
In big cities such as Toronto and Vancouver, average rent for a one-bedroom apartment was up nearly 20 per cent in July from the year before, according to rentals.ca, and up more than 25 per cent in Calgary. It was 10 per cent higher than a year ago in Hamilton and in Victoria and more than 5 per cent higher in Ottawa.
Several universities are either opening new residences or trumpeting their construction. At Queen’s, a new university residence will open this year with more than 330 additional beds. At the University of Victoria, a new residence will add nearly 400 beds this fall with another new building adding 385 beds in 2023 – a 25-percent increase in its residence capacity in the space of a year. The University of Toronto, University of Windsor and Carleton University are among the schools that have new residences under construction.
Paul Davidson, president of Universities Canada, an umbrella group representing nearly 100 postsecondary institutions, said universities could be an ally to governments on the housing issue, as they typically own land that can be developed and can get projects moving quickly. But these are multimillion-dollar projects and universities will need additional funding from provincial and federal governments, he said.

Full text: Julia Huang is still surprised she pillaged her savings account to spend US$10,000 on a cartoon. For her money, she received ownership of a digital file – specifically, an illustration drawn by Scott Martin, an artist from Hamilton. It was one of 10,000 drawings he and two business partners released last October as part of a collection of non-fungible tokens, or NFTs, under the name Doodles. The series sold out within minutes.
Since then, more than US$520-million worth of Doodles have traded hands, making it one of the most popular NFT collections in the world. Today, the cheapest Doodle will run a buyer about $13,500, while the most expensive one sold for US$1.1-million.
Ms. Huang, a 26-year-old designer in Washington, heard about NFTs long before they were popular. An NFT, she learned, represents a one-of-a-kind digital asset, often a graphic, whose ownership is recorded on a blockchain, a decentralized ledger of sorts.
She was intrigued by how the technology could help artists generate income, but never purchased anything big until a friend told her about Doodles.
She loved the playfulness of Mr. Martin’s drawings, each depicting a different character rendered in thick black lines and bathed in soft pastel hues, often with blank, round eyes not quite attached to their heads. Some of the rarest and thus most desirable Doodles feature characters spewing rainbow vomit. And so last November, Ms. Huang made the most expensive purchase of her life when she nabbed a Doodle with flowing pink hair, a hoop earring and a U-shaped smile. “This is the most insane thing that I’ve ever done,” she says.
Ms. Huang doesn’t think she’d ever resell it. She talks about her Doodle as part of her “personal journey,” saying it rekindled her creativity and led her to pursue her own art project illustrating her Doodle in new settings. She’s become close friends with fellow holders online, and met up offline at Doodles events in Miami, Austin and New York. “I feel like I’m a Doodles groupie,” she says.
The success of Doodles surprised Mr. Martin as well, and it’s been a strange time for him since the project launched. “It’s like a new life, but it’s at the cost of my old one,” says Mr. Martin, who previously completed artistic commissions for companies such as Google and Dropbox. In NFT circles, he’s better known by his online alias, Burnt Toast. Co-founder Evan Keast, also Canadian, is known as Tulip.
The third founder, Jordan Castro, goes by, uh, Poopie. In the past few months, they’ve hired a chief executive, started to raise venture capital, and accrued celebrity fans such as DJ Steve Aoki and Pharrell Williams, who joined as a board member.
The founders are determined to turn Doodles into a bona fide business, with licensing deals, consumer products, animated content, an album, live events and many, many more NFTs.
But after exploding in popularity last year, the NFT market is in the dumps.
Sales volume plummeted from US$5.7-billion in January to $903-million in July, according to data tracking firm DappRadar, while transactions fell about 50 per cent to 5.9 million. Not even “blue chip” NFT projects – so named because the founders have a track record, or, at the very least, a plan – are immune. The JPG NFT Index tracking such projects has crashed 50 per cent since April, while the floor price of a Bored Ape, cartoon drawings of morose simians often flogged by celebrities, has been cut in half. (The term refers to the lowest price for an NFT associated with a collection.) OpenSea, the largest NFT marketplace, slashed 20 per cent of its staff in July.
The decline follows the wider crypto crash. NFTs are typically transacted in ether, a cryptocurrency that has fallen about 55 per cent against the Canadian dollar this year. On top of that, the world is experiencing rampant inflation with economies teetering on recession. Investors are looking for safe havens, and it’s hard to think of a riskier asset than a JPG.
“The bubble has burst, or still has to burst,” says Pedro Herrera, head of research at DappRadar. “Ninety to 95 per cent of the projects that we currently see in the market, in two years, will be worth close to zero.”
With values crashing, proponents are talking a lot more about “utility” these days, an effort to bring some kind of broader functionality to NFTs. Until now, NFTs have commonly been used for digital art and collectibles, held in a wallet in hopes of appreciating in value. It amounts to speculation. Indeed, to many people, NFTs are the most egregious example of tech-fuelled bluster and irrational greed run amok. Recently, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates pointed to the “greater fool” theory to describe NFTs (and crypto more broadly), which posits investors can make money on the most worthless asset so long as someone else is gullible enough to buy it at a higher price.
But proponents argue NFTs can be used for so much more – as entry passes to events, keys to obtaining exclusive merchandise, digital assets inside video games and applications yet to be dreamed up. For Doodles, it comes down to this: How much can you do with a picture of rainbow vomit?
The first time most people heard the term “non-fungible token” was likely early last year, when people spent hundreds and then thousands and then hundreds of thousands of dollars to own the equivalent of animated GIFs culled from professional basketball games. In 2020, Vancouver company Dapper Labs partnered with the league to launch NBA Top Shot, a marketplace for digital basketball collectibles. It’s now a case study of the fickleness of NFT investors.
Top Shot NFTs – or “moments,” as Dapper Labs called them – initially traded for a few dollars each. Jesse Schwarz, a 33year-old entrepreneur from Montreal now based in Los Angeles, spent a few thousand dollars on Top Shot over a few months in 2020, partly as a lark. “It’s always the things that seem stupid at first that end up being the biggest things in the world,” he says.
As a kid, he traded Pokemon cards and sneakers, and for him, digital collectibles had an immediate appeal.
Mr. Schwarz became skilled at flipping Top Shots – and he wasn’t the only one. In October, 2020, there were just 19,689 Top Shot transactions, for a dollar volume of US$835,451, according to NFT data site CryptoSlam. A speculative bubble then rapidly inflated, brought on by a combination of hype around a new technology, pandemic boredom and a kind of infectious mania already in the air from meme stocks. By March, 2021, there were more than 1.3 million trades, and volume surged to more than $208-million. At first, the most Mr. Schwarz paid for a single Top Shot moment was $180.
“And then, two months later, I was spending $200,000,” he says. “It’s crazy how fast it creeps up on you.”
Specifically, he dropped US$208,000 on a clip of LeBron James practically soaring over another player for a slam dunk. It was a somewhat impulsive purchase. He was sitting on cash from selling other NFTs and wanted a “big fish,” he recalls. Everything was going up in price. He’d been a huge LeBron James fan since he was 14 years old. So, well, why not? “It felt like a deal,” he says.
Today, Mr. Schwarz does not exactly have buyer’s remorse. He still owns the NFT and it’s part of his online identity. He even set up the website lebron.com to commemorate his purchase. But Top Shot peaked around that time. “They dropped the ball on a lot of things,” he says of Dapper Labs. He faults the company for having too little supply at first, which pushed prices up, and then too much supply later on, which drove prices down. More crucially, Dapper Labs couldn’t maintain interest. “Attention just shifted to other NFT projects,” Mr. Schwarz says.
As of July, 2022, Top Shot transactions are down close to 60 per cent from a peak in 2021, while the number of unique buyers fell 90 per cent. Sales volume, meanwhile, collapsed by 96 per cent.
Dapper Labs disagrees with Mr. Schwarz’s assessment.
“What’s happening now in the market is consumers are coming to products that aren’t built to be speculative in nature, but rather are built for long-term value like Top Shot,” said Jayne Peressini, general manager of Top Shot, over e-mail. “We believe we’re just scratching the surface on what’s possible with the utility of NFTs.” To that end, Dapper Labs has been bringing holders to games and arranging meet-and-greets with players. It also provides a monthly budget to “captains” (really engaged Top Shot holders) to run events, hold watch parties and organize giveaways for other holders. Volume is picking up, Ms. Peressini noted, while Top Shot has been “holding back supply to increase value.”
Mr. Schwarz, for all his criticisms, did sell a Top Shot for $15,000 recently. “It’s not dead,” he says. “This correction is healthy. Things just can’t go up forever.”
With the NFT market in a slump, there is a lot of pressure on the founders of Doodles. “I feel a great sense of responsibility,” illustrator Scott Martin says. “I’m aware of the fact that people can lose money, and that’s concerning.”
Now 35, he never thought art could be a career. He grew up in Greensville, Ont., just outside of Hamilton, and has been drawing for as long as he can remember. He was influenced by cartoons such as The Simpsons and Rugrats, borrowed tropes from skateboard culture and melded it into a style that combines silliness with cynicism. A cartoon called Mitosis is a typical example: conjoined twins set against a pink backdrop, one serenely detaching the other with a large knife. (Mr. Martin, incidentally, has a twin brother.)
He studied 3-D animation at Humber College and took a job at a local television station, using his skills to put together used car commercials. Meanwhile, he posted his illustrations to Instagram, and built both a fan base and a freelance career. In 2020, a friend and collaborator encouraged him to sell his work as NFTs. His first attempt netted a few thousand dollars. “The more exciting part was just knowing somebody would want to pay for my work without actually being able to hold it,” he says.
One of the people who took notice of his work happened to be his eventual business partner, Evan Keast. A native of Vernon, B.C., Mr. Keast worked in civil engineering after graduating from the University of Calgary, but left to start a number of ventures that attempted to jump on cultural trends – including a Donald Trump chew toy for dogs and a service for breaking up with people. In a way, he became someone who specialized in capturing attention for ephemera, even working on a mobile app and e-commerce strategy for a wildly popular Instagram meme account whose name cannot be printed here.
Later, he was hired at Dapper Labs and worked in marketing for CryptoKitties, an early NFT project, where he met Jordan Castro, the third Doodles co-founder. He left in just under two years. “The space at the time was not that exciting,” he says.
But then NFTs blew up, and early last year, he and Mr. Castro started developing their own project. They had a few illustrators in mind, but Mr. Martin’s work stood out.
“We were just sick of seeing all this trash coming out,” Mr. Keast says of other NFTs.
“We wanted to change the quality level.”
Over the next few months, they mapped out Doodles – deciding how much rainbow puke there should be, how many different hairstyles and what kinds of facial expressions – and Mr. Martin drew each element. Only 100 Doodles were completed entirely by hand. The rest are generative, meaning a computer script randomly assembled the various components to create new characters.
The collection went on sale in October, each one priced at about US$475. Mr. Martin was on a Zoom call with his two partners, watching as the number of NFTs available for purchase quickly ticked lower. Within a few minutes, they were all gone. The sale resulted in a windfall, and Doodles receives a 5-per-cent royalty on transactions through major NFT marketplaces. On OpenSea, the largest marketplace, the original Doodles collection has generated about 7,335 in ether, the cryptocurrency, which is worth around $15-million today. Royalties are split between the company (officially, it’s called Doodles LLC) and a community treasury, which also helps fund the project.
Buyers who got in early were able to make huge gains, too. The process is not unlike an initial public offering, where those with insider knowledge and connections come out ahead. Some Doodles
holders told me they learned about it before it launched through so-called alpha groups, where NFT holders trade tips on coming projects.
Joe, a 36-year-old in Ohio, heard about Doodles when Mr. Keast popped into a members-only online group to say he was working on something new. (The Globe is identifying Joe by his first name only, because he is uncomfortable speaking publicly candidly about his finances.) He had been trading NFTs for a little while, and since he’s a management consultant, he created a slide deck to outline what makes a long-term hold instead of a quick flip. In his “NFT Success Framework” Joe looks at three main traits: the team’s track record, how much effort is put into the art and whether there’s anything unique about the project. Doodles hit all three, in his view.
Because Joe found out about Doodles early, he was able to join the group’s private Discord server before it closed to new members. As part of the exclusive club, he and his investment partner were each given access to purchase five Doodles just before the public sale. Later on, they resold four of them and pocketed a US$125,000 profit. The thrill of such a win is part of the appeal, but so too are the bragging rights: “I just want to be able to say to people that I was an early investor,” he says.
Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian, who runs a venture capital firm called Seven Seven Six, is also a Doodles holder, having purchased four depicting a girl who reminded him of his daughter. He was so taken with the collection that his firm is raising the first round of financing for Doodles, and his founding partner, Katelin Holloway, joined the board of directors. (The financing has yet to close.)
Earlier in her career, Ms. Holloway worked as a script supervisor at Pixar, and she’s taken to calling Doodles the “Disney of Web3.” In her view, Doodles will be an entire entertainment universe – “a household brand where your kids are wearing diapers with Doodles on them,” she says – though the Web3 component is where things get murky. The term refers to a new, decentralized vision of the internet that replaces giant platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. Instead, proponents foresee an internet incorporating blockchains, cryptocurrencies and NFTs, where users have both a financial stake in, and more control over, how web communities function. Web3 has also been derided as a meaningless buzzword, a ploy to garner attention and investment.
In May, Doodles hired a CEO named Julian Holguin, who previously headed music publication Billboard. At a recent NFT event, he too talked about Doodles as a budding entertainment franchise that takes a “blockchain and Web3” approach while “leveraging traditional media and experiences to onboard new people to our community.”
Like any NFT project, Doodles has to accomplish two main tasks to ensure that it has any kind of longevity: provide value for existing holders, and convert more people into fans.
Some of its plans, though lacking in specifics, are easy to comprehend, such as video games or an animated film or series.
Doodles wants to host events where holders are granted VIP access, and sell merchandise. (It’s previously sold T-shirts, hoodies, tote bags and a US$350 figurine.)
And earlier this year, Mr. Holguin used his industry connections to recruit musician Pharrell Williams to join the Doodles board and serve as chief brand officer. (“I flew down to L.A. to meet Pharrell, just to see if we vibed,” Mr. Martin recalled. They vibed.) Work is under way with Mr. Williams and Columbia Records to produce a Doodles album that, for reasons as yet unclear, will be released as an NFT.
Other ideas remain frustratingly abstract. For a planned NFT collection that will be offered at a lower price to appeal to more people, the team has suggested that owners will be able to purchase wearables for their Doodles and select music for them to listen to. I tried to make sense of this with Mr. Martin, but failed. “It’s like a digital character that you can dress and pose and switch emotions,” he said. “It’ll make more sense when the metaverse is more mainstream.”
Strip away the Web3 bafflegab, and the Doodles strategy amounts to brand extension built on Mr. Martin’s illustrations. If that’s the case, why does Doodles need to have an NFT component at all? Entertainment franchises have been built for decades without the sweaty hype of non-fungible tokens. Mr. Martin made the case that new technology unlocks creative potential, begetting new intellectual property. Would Mickey Mouse exist without the advent of animation? Would Mario Bros. exist without Nintendo’s home gaming system?
When I asked Ms. Holloway the same question, she paused for a moment before asking, “Why not NFTs?” As she went on, her answer had less to do with any unique characteristics of NFTs and more about capturing attention.
“There was an opportunity they saw to take the art and apply it to something that a niche group of people were incredibly passionate about,” she says. They could have gone about it another way, sure, except for one thing: “There’s no way that they would make the money that they made.”
The Doodles team are not the only ones seeking to expand the applications for NFTs. The technology has been touted as a way to do all kinds of tasks more efficiently, such as providing more visibility and traceability into supply chains, tracking blood donations, and powering real estate transactions. But Molly White, a U.S. software developer who has become a prominent critic of crypto and Web3, isn’t convinced they’re good for much of anything. “There’s little that an NFT accomplishes as far as ‘utility’ that isn’t more easily accomplished with traditional methods,” she wrote over e-mail.
On her blog, she even outlines a way to sell digital art using an encryption method without blockchains. “I don’t think NFTs became popular because there was a sudden mass understanding of the value of scarce digital objects,” she wrote in the post. “They became popular because of the get-rich-quick potential that surrounded them.”
A broad criticism of NFTs and Web3 is that any proposed application is a more complicated version of something that already exists. In June, for example, Shopify introduced “tokengated commerce,” a feature allowing online merchants to offer exclusive products to NFT holders. (Doodles partnered with Shopify on the announcement.) “Shopify sees NFTs not as speculative assets, but rather as tools for community building and engagement,” said Alex Danco, the company’s head of blockchain, over e-mail.
This may sound like a customer loyalty program to you, but not so, according to Shopify. On a recent podcast, Mr. Danco elaborated on why tokengated commerce is different. His explanation spanned 12 uninterrupted minutes. Eventually, he talked about how merchants can offer different combinations of products based on the NFTs that customers hold in their digital wallets. I listened back several times and was still left with the impression that it’s a loyalty program for NFT holders.
(Shopify did not respond when asked for clarification.)
When I asked proponents about practical uses for NFTs, some pointed to the metaverse, which refers to immersive and connected virtual words, a concept that has yet to fully take shape. In the metaverse, NFTs denote ownership of wearables for avatars, along with digital land.
Yuga Labs, the company that owns Bored Apes, raised US$320-million through selling digital real estate in its own virtual world, which has not launched. Such digital assets don’t have to take the form of NFTs, however. Video games and virtual worlds such as Second Life have had thriving marketplaces for wearables and digital land for years.
Others suggested the live events industry is ripe for disruption partly because, as one consultant told me, NFT tickets can be sold as collectibles. So can paper tickets, of course, and as Ms. White pointed out, online ticketing works pretty well today. For the consumer, the point of a ticket is to provide easy access to an event, and loading up a digital wallet with cryptocurrency to buy NFT tickets seems like extra work.
The notion that NFTs are a solution in search of a problem was typified in a recent video clip that went viral on Twitter.
Packy McCormick, an adviser to the crypto fund at venture capital firm a16z, was asked on a podcast to outline a use case.
He talked about using blockchains to record real estate transactions and convert mortgages into NFTs. The interviewer kept poking. What does that mean? How is that any better? Mr. McCormick capitulated. “I got wrecked on the mortgage example because I’ve never thought through that one before,” he said.
Ms. Holloway says she’s often asked (including by her mother) about the point of NFTs. “The answer is, we’re going to figure out what this utility is, and why this is an important thing,” she says.
What’s happening now, she continues, is throwing spaghetti at the wall to see what sticks. She hasn’t advised her mother to buy an NFT yet. “You have to be patient and let it blossom,” she says.
For now, the model Doodles is pursuing is like a glorified fan club, where the cost of entry is an NFT. Holders get to join a community, support Mr. Martin’s art, and enjoy the benefits of exclusive events and merchandise. It’s a cultural signifier of sorts, a marker of someone with money to spend. (More than one person described blue-chip NFTs to me as the equivalent of owning Gucci.)
Whether the fan base is attracted to the art, the novelty of NFTs, the status it imbues, or the chance of a big payout some day is difficult to untangle. Maybe it’s everything. But if the bubble completely bursts and it all turns to vapour, at least one thing will remain for Doodles holders: a cartoon with calming pastels and rainbows, to remind them of better days.

Full text: 49 Williamson Rd., Toronto BEACHES Asking price: $1,899,000 (July, 2022) Selling price: $2,457,000 (July, 2022) Taxes: $7,399 (2021) Days on the market: Four Listing agents: Mary Jo Vradis and Meray Mansour, Rare Real Estate THE ACTION This two-storey house is a recognizable landmark among locals due to its bright yellow façade and its lush gardens on a 30- by 118-foot lot near a popular school in Toronto’s Beaches neighbourhood. Naturally, the moment buyers were invited inside, 40 signed up for tours and more than 100 others flocked to two open houses. Five offers came in above the $1.899-million list price, and one revised their bid to $2.457-million to beat the competition.
“We had more interest than we thought possible in this market,” agent Mary Jo Vradis said.
“This was an iconic home, right across the street from Williamson Road [Junior Public] school, and it’s on a corner lot. It had beautiful mature trees, lots of fruit trees and perennials, so it was a stunning garden.”
WHAT THEY GOT This 106-year-old house maintains some original finishes, but in the past 10 years, its roofing, plumbing and mechanical systems were updated, and the basement was revamped as a stylish, two-bedroom unit.
Each level above grade has one bathroom and a kitchen with appliances.
The second floor also accommodates three bedrooms. The main floor has more space for a bedroom, a dining room and a living room with beamed ceilings and a wood-burning fireplace. A rear sunroom benefits from heated tile flooring and two exits to a wraparound deck.
Parking is access through a laneway.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “It had so much unique character. It’s not the type of home you see every day,” Ms. Vadis said.
“It had a ton of potential. You could make it a single-family home, rent the basement or make it a triplex.”

Full text: A nearly complete mixed-use retail and residential rental project has been pushed into receivership in London, Ont., as its lender alleges construction delays blew up an initial $18-million construction budget and dozens of contractors claim millions in unpaid work.
London’s Applewood Marketplace Inc. may be just one of many developments to face financial trouble amid grinding delays and rising costs affecting the building industry. Data from the real estate research and data company Altus Group shows roughly 60 per cent of residential and commercial projects are facing delays of about a third of their original timetables.
Court filings from construction lender MarshallZehr Group Inc. allege that Applewood owes it more than $58-million, with the interest on all that debt surpassing $36,000 per day. Contractors have also filed liens for $8million in unpaid work.
There are two named principals for Applewood Marketplace, located on former farmland on the northern edge of London: Mike Clawson and Perry Sempecos. Mr. Clawson up until recently was primarily known as a London-based custom home builder, and Mr. Sempecos is part of a family business in real estate and commercial development.
The court documents contain unproven allegations that have not been tested in court. Mr. Sempecos declined to comment and Mr. Clawson, whose colleagues said went on a monthlong vacation to Europe starting in mid-July, could not be reached.
In 2019, Mr. Clawson purchased a parcel of land from Peter Sergautis, a local landowner who had been planning a larger subdivision with the same Applewood branding since the early 1980s and has begun to parcel and sell off pieces of the holdings. Mr. Sergautis has no ongoing financial relationship with Mr. Clawson or his partners, and said he hopes the parties will come to an agreement to finish what will allow the first portion of his dreamed development to be built.
By 2020, Mr. Clawson and Mr. Sempecos took loans from MarshallZehr to finance the construction of first phase of the project: a five-storey building with 107 rental apartments and retail spaces at ground level.
Even as Phase 1 ran into delays from key contractors, Applewood began preparing work on the land set aside for a second larger phase on the site, which was slated to hold more than 460 apartments. An affidavit from MarshallZehr chief operating officer Hayes Cecil Hayes suggests the troubled project began unravelling on April 4, 2022, when the company stopped making interest payments on its loans. In May, the first of 46 liens for unpaid work by contractors began to show up on the property title.
By June, all work on the site had stopped and on June 3, 2022, MarshallZehr sent a demand letter and Notice Of Intention To Enforce Security (NITES) to Applewood. After that, the debtors allegedly attempted to sell the project to a third party and shared with MarshallZehr an agreement of purchase and sale that has since expired. In an affidavit, Mrs. Hayes writes: “I think it is unlikely that the transaction as currently structured would be to be concluded,” while acknowledging the assessment of the potential sale is up to receiver.
On Aug. 3, a receiver was appointed from Ernst & Young Inc.
to oversee a resolution to the company’s insolvency. What happens next will be some sort of arrangement that will either see MarshallZehr converting its debt into equity ownership of the project or a sale arrangement of some kind that pays off the loans.
“It would be inappropriate for MarshallZehr to provide additional comments regarding this receivership,” said MarshallZehr CEO Peter Berczi.
In construction, time is money and delays can end up burning through a company’s cash reserves.
“The interest is just the tip of the iceberg – it is way bigger than that,” said David Schoonjans, a senior director with Altus Group who focusses on costs and project management.
“There’s project overhead: crane rentals, management, subcontractors. Take a 30-storey high-rise in the GTA; you can easily burn through half a million or $800,000 every month you’re delayed. That’s a lot of money very quickly. And there’s 50 companies on that project, so when you delay, you open yourself to a massive box of litigation troubles.”
Mr. Schoonjans said one challenge in defining delays and their potential costs is that there maybe cases where a planned timeline was never realistic, which means costs were underestimated from the start. What may be happening now is that the tide is going out and beaching builders who were already swimming too close to the rocks.
“When the markets are going up and everybody sees what looks like massive profits … all they’ve ever seen is people making money off of real estate and for a lot of years a lot of sloppy mistakes were covered up by rising revenues,” said Mr. Schoonjans.
While the demand for housing is as hot as it ever was, costs to build have risen even faster than revenues. “We’re at this standoff where costs either have to go down or revenues have to go up … or projects are not going to get built.
While the financial challenges of delays impact the top players in a development, the bad news also rolls downhill to the subcontractors whose businesses are also pressured by the same labour and supply issues.
Steve Creces of C.D. Drywall & Acoustics in London filed a $170,000 lien after drywall and soundproofing work he did in the Applewood building’s retail space was stopped. “It’s substantial. We’re not a large contractor.
We do about $5-6-million a year in revenue. It’s a big hit,” he said.

Full text: VANCOUVER Imagine a new 35-hectare community of midrises built out of mass timber – a place that restricts cars and has a significant share of truly affordable housing for low to moderate incomes.
That’s the vision put forward by a citizens’ group that wants the City of Vancouver and a First Nations-owned developer to come up with a new plan for Vancouver’s Jericho Lands, located in West Point Grey. They want a guarantee that housing would be truly affordable and sustainable, as opposed to concrete luxury view condos that sell at $2,400 per square foot and create gloomy corridors, which was their takeaway after seeing the early conceptual plans released by the city last fall.
“It’s sort of like the old saw about generals always fighting the last war,” says resident Susan Fisher, a member of the Jericho Coalition, which formed to oppose the current plans for the area. “Instead of looking forward to seeing what we need to do to be viable and sustainable 10 or 20 years down the line, they are building the way they have since the 1990s. They don’t recognize the world is changing very quickly and surely it would be prudent for city staff to take a forward perspective on this.”
Jericho Lands, the site of a long-time military base, is a spectacular, massive and underutilized piece of real estate that, once developed, will transform the west side of the city. Vancouver’s west side feels empty, and the redevelopment of Jericho Lands is a golden opportunity to create a community that doesn’t have a lot of underground parking and luxury housing that the majority of workers will not be able to afford, the coalition says.
The conceptual plans were created by the MST Development Corp., a partnership of three First Nations; Canada Lands Co., a Crown corporation that co-owns part of the proposed development land; and the City of Vancouver. The city released the conceptual plans for the site last fall that showed three 38-storey towers amid many more midrise buildings and about 10 million square feet of floor space (about double the size of Oakridge, a massive mixed-use development in south-central Vancouver built around what was Oakridge Centre mall).
The next phase in the city’s process is to refine the concept and draft a policy statement, so there is still time to hammer out the details of such an important site. In an e-mail, city staff said no dates have been set and the next phase of public engagement will be after the election in October.
The conceptual plans put forward last fall would certainly transform the area bordered by Fourth Avenue, Highbury Street, West 8th Avenue and Discovery Street. The area is adjacent to a seaside park with a large bird habitat that is a draw for residents throughout the Lower Mainland.
Jericho Coalition residents have mounted a petition that has more than 1,000 signatures that asks the city to go back to the drawing board.
Ms. Fisher said she supports midrise buildings and alternative types of non-market housing, such as co-ops and co-housing, as opposed to a concentration of high-rise condos that she argues drive land prices up. City policy requires a minimum of 20 per cent below-market housing and 10 per cent rental housing.
“We spent two-and-a-half years talking about sustainability, affordability and respect for biodiversity in the land, and we thought we were being engaged in a way that some of these concerns would be reflected in the final plan,” Ms. Fisher says. “At the very end, we were shown many would-be towers. I think a lot of people in the working group felt we were blindsided in the end by this extremely dense high-rise development, which was not at all what we thought the developers and the city had in mind.”
There is talk about building a SkyTrain station at Jericho Lands as part of an extension to the University of British Columbia after completion of the Broadway line.
Rapid transit costs taxpayers billions of dollars, and significant density around transit stations makes sense. But if the goal is to build a new neighbourhood for local income-earners who will use rapid transit to get to work, then expensive housing isn’t going to attract those workers. Costly high-end condos do not justify a new transit station, the Jericho Coalition says.
“There just seems to be a default to big towers everywhere to solve the problems, and Jericho didn’t seem to be any exception to that,” says Murray Hendren, an engineer with an environmental background, who lives in a condo across from the site and is a member of the coalition.
Jericho Lands are privately owned by MST Development Corp., a partnership between the Musqueam Indian Band, Squamish Nation and Tsleil-Waututh Nation, and the Canada Lands Co., a Crown corporation that specializes in real estate and development. They purchased the land in 2014, and MST and CLC each own 50 per cent.
MST later purchased the western part of the site from the province for almost a half-billion dollars. The two parcels are being planned as one community, designed in a way that pays respect to the ancestral land. MST and CLC have been working with nearby residents and the City of Vancouver in planning the site.
Unlike the proposed Senakw development, which is on Squamish Nation reserve land on the edge of the Kitsilano neighbourhood, Jericho Lands fall within city guidelines and policies.
Last fall, the public was presented with two conceptual plan options, both consisting of about 10 million square feet of floor space, three 38-storey condo towers, with about 10,000 homes, for about 20,000 residents. The population of West Point Grey is only about 13,000 residents, so it’s a game-changer.
After city council approves the policy statement for the new neighbourhood, then the owners will apply for rezoning, which is likely a 10-year process. The total build out of Jericho Lands is about 25 to 30 years. The three First Nations will retain ownership and sell units as leasehold properties.
One of the planning priorities for Jericho Lands is reconciliation. MST oversees six major properties within Metro Vancouver worth more than $1-billion, including Jericho Lands. Two of the properties are co-owned with Aquilini Investment Group.
Tsleil-Waututh councillor Dennis Thomas, who is a cultural liaison for MST, says it’s a pivotal time for Indigenous communities as they take economic control of ancestral lands. The TsleilWaututh own real estate business ventures of their own worth more than $1-billion. They’ve gone from “managing poverty to managing wealth,” Mr. Thomas says.
“We can actually control our own destiny. We can control our economic opportunities ourselves,” he says. “It’s a cool time to be in right now, and I’m very humbled and respectful of Indigenous knowledge holders before me, and what they have been able to do for me to enjoy this moment right now.”
In terms of planning any community, he’s keen on self-contained live-work-play communities and less sprawl. Regarding Jericho, they will follow the city’s guidelines, he says, but he’d also like go beyond the requirements for non-market or social housing.
“I think it depends on the official community plan within the city of Vancouver and we are trying to really participate in the policies that they have. If it means higher density, then it’s higher density. If it means middle density, then it means middle density,” he says.
“With fee simple properties, we do have to follow the guidelines of the City of Vancouver and the environmental goals. We have to follow everything. But we also want to be above and beyond, and be leaders in that.”
MST vice-president Brennan Cook, former vice-president at Aquilini Group, says that MST is poised to become the region’s largest developer of housing.
Down the road, they will also likely become leaders in social housing.
In order to include so much green space, they needed to include towers, says Mr. Cook, who argues that highrises create significant density at a time when supply can work to bring down or stabilize home prices.
“If we say we want to have transit out to UBC, and we want to have density along those transit corridors, and we want to provide sustainable development practices, and we want to have great community benefit and amenities, including parks, open space and green space, then you start layering all these things together,” he said.
“For us, height was the place to make the equation work. I’m respectful and understand that not everybody is going to appreciate that, but what we don’t often hear in the media is there are a lot of people who do support that.”
As for going far beyond the city’s 20 per cent below-market housing requirement, they are looking into a “fuller spectrum of housing types,” he said, including the possibility of attainable home ownership. He couldn’t get into details, but he said requests to deliver substantially below-market housing is an unreasonable request.
The price tag to develop Jericho is hundreds of millions of dollars. What’s needed to reduce prices is more supply, argues Mr. Cook, such as the density offered in the plan.
“Asking the Nations to deliver units at a higher percentage that is not financially viable is an unfair request. You don’t ask the other big developers in town to deliver more. So why pin that on the three Nations?” Mr. Cook said.
“If you are renting social housing at, pick a number, $2 per square foot per month, it takes a very, very long time, especially with increased interest rates right now, for that to pay back. It’s unfair to ask that solely of the Nations.”

Full text: ARCHITECTURE This summer, Los Angeles got a new icon: the Sixth Street Viaduct. The kilometre-long bridge is – at the utilitarian level – an artery connecting downtown L.A. and the neighbourhoods to the east. But it’s more than that. Replacing a beloved structure from 1932, the new bridge is a symbol of an emerging, imperfect future where public amenities gather attention and respect.
“Our aim was for the bridge to have a broad positive impact on the community,” said architect Michael Maltzan, whose firm led the design. “I think we are at a moment where we should try to explore again what infrastructure means in a city.”
My journey across the viaduct began in Boyle Heights, a working-class district just east of downtown L.A. On a recent sunny Friday, I met Paul Stoelting, the project architect, on a sidewalk next to a film studio. (Mr.
Maltzan was isolating at home with COVID-19.) Before us stood a construction site for a new park that will occupy 12 acres under the bridge, and serve a neighbourhood that has more freeway ramps than public green space.
From there, we walked up a spiral ramp to the bridge’s deck.
A cyclist passed us, rolling downhill – a sign of the bridge’s ambition, Mr. Stoelting pointed out, to serve different forms of transportation in this notoriously carcentric city.
Up close, the bridge offered some aesthetic pleasures. The concrete was slightly rough to the touch and varied in colour, like a rock formation. The complex formwork that shaped it had left marks on the surface.
And the 20 arches that support the bridge showed Maltzan’s characteristic flair. Ten crescents leaped up and curved back downward in a dynamic rhythm – tall, short, tall – while leaning outward as if to embrace the whole city.
That bigger gesture is, in some ways, the whole point. Back in 2012, the City of Los Angeles launched a design competition for the site: A previous bridge, constructed in 1932, was weakening from a chemical reaction known as “concrete cancer.” But that older bridge was iconic. It was designed by Los Angeles city engineer Merrill Butler, and its twin arches capped with Art Deco towers had been landmarks for generations. It was captured onscreen in TV and film scenes – such as the drag race in Grease, which took place in the concretelined Los Angeles River below the bridge.
The new structure picks up on the cultural legacy of the old one. A hundred years ago, the phrase “public works” carried an air of importance. Public officials such as Mr. Butler – who oversaw the construction of half a dozen bridges in the 1920s and 1930s – were inspired by the City Beautiful Movement, which tried to bring order to North America’s messy streetscapes. (Toronto’s Bloor Street Viaduct, created by the visionary city engineer R.C.
Harris, is an example.)
Mr. Butler “believed that any structures the city was building should contribute to an overall sense of betterment and beauty,” Mr. Maltzan said. And this, he added, is an idea that still has value. “I think architecture has the ability to continue to take on that challenge, to make things which are strong aesthetic contributions in the city, and also relate to the spirit of our moment.”
Such ambition has been absent from North American infrastructure in recent decades.
The field is dominated by large architecture and engineering firms, including HNTB, which collaborated with Mr. Maltzan’s firm on the $588-million (U.S.)
L.A. viaduct. In Canada, the equivalents are AECOM and the behemoth architecture firm IBI.
Meanwhile, high-design architects typically work on housing and cultural buildings. That’s the case for Michael Maltzan Architecture, which recently completed Qaumajuq, the new centre for Inuit Art at the Winnipeg Art Gallery.
And even when present, ambition doesn’t change the world overnight. Mr. Maltzan and L.A.
Mayor Eric Garcetti have both spoken optimistically about the bridge as a symbol of active transportation, and it does indeed have a comfortable sidewalk and bike lane. However, as local road-safety and cycling advocates have pointed out, only plastic barriers separate cyclists from car traffic. Riders who brave the span are vulnerable to out-of-control vehicles – and since the bridge has already become a hotspot for street racing, this is a real problem. The city’s response has been more law enforcement. An LAPD vehicle growled past Mr. Stoelting and I during our walk.
Still, the bridge has been greeted warmly by many residents, including locals in the predominantly Latino and workingclass Boyle Heights. It’s become a place for people to go for a stroll, cruise in their cars or take quinceañera portraits.
That’s evidence of the lack of nearby public space. L.A. has only 1.3 hectares of park space per 1,000 residents. (Toronto has 2.7.) It also raises real concerns that real estate investment will follow, making Boyle Heights more expensive and displacing existing residents.
It’s also, perhaps, evidence that design can only go so far.
One project can’t undo a century of car culture, or construct a whole network of bike lanes, or solve the economic and racial segregation that is painfully present on the streets of Los Angeles.
And yet aspiration is important. The next generation in both Canada and the U.S. will see a boom in infrastructure that will only accelerate as the effects of climate change worsen. This development will include transit and (unfortunately) roads. Great public design will be fundamental.
The Sixth Street Viaduct already “has become a public forum,” Mr. Maltzan said. “It’s allowed people to talk about how we continue to make the city.”
That conversation can’t happen quickly enough.

Full text: One afternoon before an August long weekend in 1991, a criminal lawyer appeared in a Halifax courtroom on behalf of his client, grocery magnate Donald Sobey. A few months prior, Mr. Sobey had been charged with sexually assaulting a young man in a downtown hotel room.
Mr. Sobey was a prominent figure in Atlantic Canada by then, serving as chairman of Empire Co. Ltd., his family’s sprawling holding company that included the Sobeys grocery chain. He was also a member of the board of governors at Dalhousie University, where the victim was a student.
Mr. Sobey did not appear in court that day when his lawyer entered a plea: guilty to a summary offence of sexual assault. The judge issued a $750 fine, according to a local news report that ran about 400 words.
Afterward, his lawyer dismissed the charge as a minor matter that had been “handled appropriately and expeditiously,” while Mr. Sobey, then 56, put out his own statement. “I have learned that in Canadian law, sexual assault covers an extraordinarily broad range of activities ranging from extremely serious to comparatively minor. The summary charge indicates a minor offence,” he said. “I apologize for any offence which was taken and also for taking up the time of the justice system.”
Mr. Sobey thanked his family for their support, adding he had learned how “a person can find new strength in difficult times.”
With that, the story ended.
By the time Mr. Sobey died in March, 2021, at the age of 86, it was not even a footnote in his biography. He was remembered as a brilliant businessman who helped expand the Sobeys grocery chain, and a philanthropist whose generosity would span generations.
Newspaper obituaries tallied his accolades: the Order of Canada, the Canadian Business Hall of Fame, and eight honorary degrees, to name a few. Dalhousie University hailed his commitment to education, the World Wildlife Fund his commitment to ocean conservation, the National Gallery of Canada his commitment to the arts.
Derek Power, however, remembered Donald Sobey differently.
He remembered Mr. Sobey as the man who unzipped his pants and touched him in a hotel room when he was 20 years old, and as the man who never apologized to him for it.
Mr. Power only learned about the guilty plea when he read about it in a newspaper.
Now 51, Mr. Power has never spoken publicly about any of this. He tried at first, calling up local newspapers when charges were laid, but never heard back. Later, he wasn’t allowed to talk. In 1992, he reached a private settlement with Mr. Sobey that bound him to a non-disclosure agreement. If breached, he was to pay $20,000 to the man who assaulted him. The agreement meant he could not share widely that this was not some random encounter. He couldn’t share that he had been friends with the Sobey family, that he vacationed with them, that Mr. Sobey had fawned over him and promised him a future in the company. Few people knew there had been another unwanted encounter that occurred when Mr. Power was a teenager.
He was open with those close to him about what had happened, and told Joanne Klimaszewski, now his wife, not long after they met. Years later, he spoke with another media outlet, despite the NDA, but the story was dropped. After all, Mr. Sobey had been charged and admitted his guilt. What more was there to say? On the surface, one could argue the system worked, unlike the many instances in which powerful men have gotten away with predatory behaviour for years, only to be undone amid the #MeToo movement.
But it never felt like justice to him. Mr. Sobey was a powerful and well-regarded businessman, who continued through life uninterrupted. He could put out a statement that presented the assault he committed as an ordeal for him, one that taught him about resilience. He remained on the boards of influential Canadian institutions, such as TorontoDominion Bank and Dalhousie University, and built goodwill through philanthropy. He had the power to shape his legacy, to influence what was remembered, forgotten, and never known at all.
That’s a privilege Mr. Power never had. He was surrounded by the Sobey name when living in Atlantic Canada: stores, shoppings bags, commercials, and reports on Mr. Sobey’s philanthropy. All were reminders of an assault that he wanted to forget, one that left him deeply angered. He had to leave the Maritimes entirely because of the omnipresence of the Sobey name. Later, when his first child was born, Mr. Power was scared to touch his son out of fear he may violate him. Then, in 2020, he learned that Mr. Sobey’s foundation had backed the creation of a lab at Dalhousie focused on restorative justice, which looks at alternate forms of resolution between victim and perpetrator.
“I couldn’t believe it,” Mr. Power says, who resolved then to speak out. He first contacted a reporter on this story last year, two months before Mr. Sobey died.
Through a public-relations agency, the three adult children of Mr. Sobey provided a statement to The Globe. “We believe there is much we all can learn from the voices of victims. The family of Donald R. Sobey regrets this matter. Mr. Sobey pleaded guilty before the Courts of Nova Scotia in 1991 and this has been a matter of public record ever since,” the statement reads.
Mr. Power’s own account has never been part of the public record, and speaking out so many years later is simply a way to create one, providing a more complete picture of Mr. Sobey’s legacy.
At one point, he discussed with Ms. Klimaszewski whether he should tell his story. She was fully supportive. “Instead of just letting it eat away at you forever,” she told him, “let’s just get it out.” Today, Mr. Power lives in Toronto with Ms. Klimaszewski and their two children. He’s a gregarious storyteller prone to winding digressions, with an equally winding career path. He runs a company that installs solar panels, while also working as a set decorator for film productions. Before that, he started a line of vegan mayonnaise. A local Sobeys store approached him once about stocking his wares; it was a thrill to decline. He made an unsuccessful bid for Toronto City Council a few years ago, not because municipal politics was in his blood, but as an example for his kids. He wanted to show them that trying to change things is better than complaining.
Ever since he was young, Mr. Power has turned to painting as a creative outlet, something that has seen him through dark times. His style leans abstract – splashes of colour, a suggestion of form, where what you see can be open to interpretation.
Art is a passion he shared with Donald Sobey.
His own family and the Sobeys are worlds apart today, but go back far enough, and Mr. Power’s roots extend to important figures in Canadian business and political history. One of his great-grandfathers is William Farrell, whose consolidation of British Columbia telephone companies in the 1890s laid the foundation for Telus.
By the time he was born in 1970, only vestiges of that history remained. His parents divorced when he was a year old, and he and his two brothers lived with their mom – a hippie, as Mr. Power describes her. They led a peripatetic life, wandering Europe before returning to Vancouver and eventually driving across the country in a Ford Econoline van to Montague, PEI, where his mother became a highschool art teacher.
At 12, Mr. Power won a full-ride scholarship to Ridley College, a boarding school in St. Catharines, Ont., that opened in 1889, where previous generations of his family had attended. One of his fellow students was Irene Sobey, the daughter of Donald Sobey. They bonded over being two of the few Maritime students there, Mr. Power says, and he became part of the family’s social scene.
The Sobeys were an increasingly influential clan in Atlantic Canada by then. Their fortunes started with Frank Sobey, the scrappy entrepreneur who turned his father’s grocery store in Stellarton, N.S., into a Maritime fiefdom. In 1971, he handed the reins to his three sons: William, David and Donald.
They were not flashy about their wealth. Donald in particular was uncomfortable in the spotlight, preferring to deflect attention and credit to others.
The summer when Mr. Power was 15, Irene invited him to spend a few days at the Sobey family cottage in Pictou County, a short ferry ride across the Northumberland Strait. It was the first time he met Mr. Sobey, who was not the type to turn heads when he walked into a room, Mr. Power recalled.
He had been around wealthy people before, and it was unusual to see someone so understated. He himself stood somewhat apart from that world: the rich folks wore tennis shorts, but the Power family stuck with denim cutoffs.
Mr. Sobey took an interest in him – he gleaned that Mr. Power’s parents were divorced and that his father was not a fixture in his life – and praised his looks, intelligence and athleticism. “Everything a kid would want to hear,” Mr. Power recalls.
One night, he offered alcohol to Mr. Power and some of the other young people at the cottage. He was underage and didn’t drink (his mother was a recovering alcoholic) but he accepted. “If you’re the Sobeys and you’re offering me a drink, I’ve got to have a drink, don’t I?” He remembers waking up that night in the bedroom with a jolt. His pants were around his ankles, and his crotch was wet. At first, he thought he’d passed out and urinated on himself, he recalls. But Mr. Sobey was over top of him, and he began yelling at the older man to get off. Mr. Sobey did so, saying that he thought he’d heard an intruder.
The next morning, Mr. Sobey acted as though nothing had happened.
Mr. Power believes Mr. Sobey attempted to perform oral sex on him while he slept. “I didn’t get it then,” he says. “I’m so mad at myself for that. But I was 15, so I’m forgiving myself, too.”
In the following years, Mr. Power travelled with the Sobeys twice to Vail, Colo., for skiing. One evening after dinner, Mr. Sobey invited him to stay for drinks, just the two of them. He praised Mr. Power’s intelligence, and even offered to pay his tuition at Ridley. The attention was, in a way, flattering. Mr. Power was an ambitious teenager with aspirations in business, and it would be helpful to have someone like Donald Sobey in his corner. “I truly thought that if I ever wanted to do anything at Sobeys, I’d be more than welcome to try it out,” he says. He wasn’t looking for a father figure (he had two older brothers) but the praise shored up his confidence. “It was just reassurance to me that I’m on the right direction,” he says.
At the dinner, Mr. Sobey placed his hand on Mr. Power’s thigh, which made him uncomfortable.
Later that evening, Mr. Sobey’s wife, Beth, exploded at Mr. Power. “You’re supposed to be spending time with my daughter, not my husband,” he recalls her shouting. He phoned his mother to ask her to arrange a ticket so he could fly home, but Mr. Sobey took the receiver to reassure her, and he stayed.
In December, 1990, Mr. Sobey called out of the blue.
Mr. Power was then attending Dalhousie University, enrolled in a program that encouraged students to combine academics with community service. He was so involved in volunteering at Hope Cottage, a soup kitchen for the homeless, that he considered dropping out to accept a full-time position.
Mr. Sobey had somehow heard and called to dissuade him, even volunteering to underwrite his tuition to stay in school, which Mr. Power agreed to.
It wasn’t the first time Mr. Sobey had provided financial assistance. The previous summer, Mr. Power asked for help with tuition, and Mr. Sobey gave him $1,000.
Soon after, Mr. Sobey called again to say he would be in Halifax in February to attend the Nova Scotia Progressive Conservative party leadership convention, and asked to meet for a drink at his hotel. Mr. Power said yes, hoping the conversation might be about his future.
He picked out a dress shirt to look professional and arrived at Mr. Sobey’s room at the Sheraton Hotel. Immediately, Mr. Sobey offered him a Scotch. He sat down on the couch while Mr. Sobey took the bed, again flattering the younger man before asking about his personal life and family. Mr. Sobey soon moved to sit next to him, putting an arm on the back of the sofa and touching his leg.
Mr. Power froze, mortified. Mr. Sobey then undid his belt, slipped his hand in, and touched Mr. Power’s penis.
Something switched in Mr. Power then, and he remembers squeezing the liquor glass in his hand so hard that it cracked. He pushed Mr. Sobey away from him.
“Oh, I’m sorry,” Mr. Sobey said. “I shouldn’t have.”
Mr. Power recalls shouting at him, saying he was crazy and needed help, and fled the hotel room. As he was doing so, Mr. Sobey stuffed a wad of cash in his pocket, 10 $100 bills.
“My whole world just fucking crumbled,” Mr. Power says. “I thought I was going to be the president of Sobeys. I thought I was going to have this wonderful support to be a big businessperson, and then he does this to me.”
Later that night, Mr. Power called a friend and they met at a bar. He was panicked, the friend recalled. “I remember him being like I’d never seen him before. [He] wasn’t making sense. It was kind of hard [for him] to explain what went on with words, but I knew what he was talking about,” said the friend, who requested anonymity from The Globe because she had a falling out with Mr. Power and they are no longer in touch.
They tried calling the sexual-assault line at Dalhousie, but only got an answering machine. In the one-minute-and-three-second message he left, which The Globe has reviewed, Mr. Power does not mention Mr. Sobey directly, but repeats several times that he’s scared “beyond belief.”
He told others, too, including a fellow student named Alex Burton, now a Crown attorney in British Columbia. His friend seemed deeply shaken, Mr. Burton said. “There was no doubt in my mind that something very traumatic had happened,” he said. “I still think about this event all these years later, and I carry a significant amount of guilt because I feel like I didn’t do enough to help Derek.”
That night at the bar, he still had the bills Mr. Sobey put into his pocket. When he and his friend left, he gave it all to a busker playing guitar on the street. Mr. Power, the friend recalled, said it was “dirty money.”
He told at least one other person around that time: Nancy Hunter, a friend and fellow employee at Hope Cottage, the soup kitchen where he volunteered. “Derek at that time was a young guy who had the world by the tail,” she says. “Good looking, popular, charming, fun. When this happened to him, he was shaken and mad.”
She had experience as a volunteer crisis intervenor at an organization for sexual-assault victims, and arranged for Mr. Power to meet a female police officer, who took his account and promised it would be investigated. When he heard nothing after a month, he followed up, but couldn’t get any answers.
Some time in March, two police officers showed up at the student flat where he was living. They insinuated he didn’t know Mr. Sobey and accused him of attempting to extort the businessman, even calling him a “cokehead and a faggot,” according to Mr. Power. He picked up the phone to call Mr. Sobey in front of them, hanging up when a secretary offered to put him through.
Soon after, he learned from a news report that charges had been filed against Mr. Sobey. He had already dropped out of university, and friends noticed a dramatic shift in his personality. Doug Moore, a close family friend from PEI, found his outgoing friend had become withdrawn, and couldn’t talk about what happened. “He was really distant. He wouldn’t make eye contact with me,” Mr. Moore said.
Mr. Power’s older brother Rob said his sibling was the kind of guy who everyone loved to be By the time Donald Sobey died in March, 2021, at the age of 86, the sexual-assault conviction was not even a footnote in his biography.
around. “He was like sunshine,” he said. But he had become consumed with frustration, spiralling downward.
Some time after the assault, Mr. Power learned from a friend that he could apply to the provincial Criminal Injuries Compensation Board, which offered financial support to crime victims. Since he had lost a year of university, and turned down a summer tree-planting job to be available for the court case, he submitted an application in the fall of 1991 for what he believed the ordeal had cost him: $13,500.
He never heard from the board, he says. Instead, on April 23, 1992, he received a letter delivered by a courier to the youth hostel where he was living. It was signed by Robert Dexter, a lawyer with prominent Maritime law firm Stewart McKelvey, which he described as “general counsel for the Sobey Group.” He was writing on behalf of Mr. Sobey, he explained.
“I understand you have made an application to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board and that your application is to be heard on May 22, 1992,” Mr. Dexter wrote. “I would like to arrange a meeting with you for the purposes of determining whether your requirements could be satisfied on an informal basis without the necessity of a hearing.”
Mr. Power took his mother along to meet with the lawyer at his downtown office. Mr. Dexter, he said, told him that the compensation board had “reached out to us for us to compensate you.”
For the board to turn over that information to the perpetrator would not have been appropriate, according to Wayne MacKay, a professor emeritus at Dalhousie’s School of Law.
“The value to the perpetrator of keeping things as quiet as possible would be high. This would be particularly so for someone with the high profile of a Sobey,” he said.
Indeed, their stature had only grown over the past few years. As chair of Empire, the family holding company, Mr. Sobey oversaw the largest food distributor in the region, which had started to expand westward. The family owned the biggest drugstore chain in Atlantic Canada, a wide swath of commercial real estate, movie theatres and even bowling alleys. All told, Empire employed some 14,000 people around the time.
Mr. Dexter, who would become an important figure in Empire and serve as chairman from 2004 to 2016, declined to comment on a list of questions from The Globe. A spokesperson for Nova Scotia’s Justice Department said the compensation board no longer exists, and that it cannot comment on policies that “may have been in place at the time.”
Mr. Dexter eventually negotiated a deal with a lawyer Mr. Power hired to represent him. Under the terms of a September, 1992, settlement, which Mr. Power provided to The Globe, Mr. Sobey agreed to pay $65,000 for “general damages.” The deal included a provision that each of its terms, along with the existence of the agreement, “shall be kept strictly confidential.” Otherwise, the party who breached the agreement would have to pay $20,000 in damages to other.
On Sept. 9, Mr. Dexter’s law firm issued a cheque for the full $65,000. Mr. Power’s friend, Doug Moore, drove him to the lawyer’s office to pick it up. “It was the only time he ever talked to me about what happened,” Mr. Moore says. “He’d thought of Sobey like a father, so he really felt violated by what had happened.”
After paying his lawyer and a therapist, Mr. Power gave much of the money away – to his mother, his brother and to co-workers at Hope Cottage. He kept $13,500, the amount he had originally asked for.
None of that was harder for him than having to cut ties with Irene Sobey earlier that year. They had been friends for a few years, and he enjoyed being around her, appreciating that she was so unpretentious despite her background. But he knew he could not have the Sobeys in his life. Some time after the assault and before charges were laid, Mr. Power arranged to pick up a ring he had left at her apartment, one from Ridley College that belonged to his grandfather. He doesn’t remember exactly what he told her, only that he was sorry for what was about to happen, but it was something he had to do. He quickly left, and never saw her again.
When he was first charged, Donald Sobey entered a not-guilty plea, according to a local news article at the time. He later changed his plea and avoided the public spectacle of a trial, while the non-disclosure agreement ensured that Mr. Power would not talk.
Not even a year later, it had become a minor detail in Mr. Sobey’s life, an obscure episode with no face or name behind it. “Nova Scotians admire their ‘royal family’ even when its members appear to stumble – such as last year when Donald pleaded guilty to sexual assault on an adult male,” noted a March, 1992, profile in the Financial Post. Mr. Sobey told the paper he considered the matter closed, and the article called him a “highly cerebral” executive.
That admiration, by some measure, was true. Mr. Sobey’s reputation in the corporate world was sterling. In 1991, at the time of the assault, he sat on the board of Toronto-Dominion Bank along with other heavyweights from the Canadian business world, such as billionaire Jimmy Pattison and Videotron founder Andre Chagnon. He remained there until his resignation in 2005. A spokesperson for Mr. Pattison said he had no recollection of Mr. Sobey’s sexual-assault charge, nor whether there was any discussion about him stepping down from the board. Mr. Chagnon, through a spokesperson, declined to comment. TD also declined to comment.
He was also on the board of governors at Dalhousie University at the time, where Mr. Power was a student, and resigned in 1996. A spokesperson for the university said “it is very difficult for the university to determine what actions were taken or discussed over 30 years ago.”
In 1995, Mr. Sobey took another step that had the effect of pushing his conviction further into obscurity.
That year, he applied and received a federal pardon, meaning police and court records from his case were sealed.
He later devoted more time to philanthropy, founding the Donald R. Sobey Family Foundation, which has since donated many millions of dollars to various causes, including scholarships at multiple universities. He parlayed his love of the arts into the Sobey Art Award starting in 2002, which is now administered by the National Gallery of Canada, where he sat on the foundation’s board for years. He also supported the World Wildlife Fund, helping to establish its Atlantic office. Some of those who interacted with Mr. Sobey in the philanthropic world told The Globe they were not aware he had been charged with sexual assault in the past. Another said that because so few details were publicly available, it was hard to know what to make of it.
In 2013, Mr. Sobey was appointed to the Order of Canada, which honours citizens who have made extraordinary contributions to the country. Members of the advisory council that makes appointment recommendations are not permitted to discuss deliberations publicly, and one member from that year told The Globe they could not recall the discussions around Mr. Sobey.
A spokesperson for the Governor-General’s office noted that Mr. Sobey had been pardoned for his offence and that membership in the Order ends when a person is deceased.
Mr. Power, meanwhile, was lost after the assault.
He tried antidepressants to cope for a while, but eventually ditched them. “I’m not mentally ill. I’m pissed off,” he told himself. Shortly after the settlement, he left Canada entirely for a job with an international development agency in China. He had panic attacks, partly as the result of an illness he contracted while there, but also because he knew he would have to return home eventually, he believes. He later left the Maritimes for good because the Sobey name was inescapable.
It was in Toronto he met Joanne Klimaszewski, and they had their first child, a son, in 2011. It took him most of that first year to feel comfortable touching his son, fearing that his experience with Mr. Sobey would lead him to molest his child. “It was that mentality of, if it happens to you, you’re going to do it,” he says. He resolved that if he ever had those tendencies, he would kill himself. He later confided his fears to Ms. Klimaszewski. “He is an amazing father,” she says. “He didn’t have a dad, so I think he goes that extra mile.”
There were still many triggers. If dinner guests arrived at their home with food in a plastic bag from Sobeys, she would throw it away before Mr. Power could see. Any time he saw or read something hailing Mr. Sobey for his philanthropy, Ms. Klimaszewski would see his mood change. He would become withdrawn and usually disappear to the garage to paint or smoke cannabis. For years, he was a habitual user, doing so in part to dull his anger. It bubbled again in 2020, when he learned the Donald R. Sobey Foundation was funding the international restorative justice lab at Dalhousie University.
The idea of restorative justice is, in part, to provide a chance for victims and offenders to discuss the weight of a crime, and repair the harm done, something Mr. Power was never afforded. In a way, his account serves as his own version of restorative justice, something to stand as part of the legacy of Mr. Sobey. He has already found some redress and catharsis through telling friends about his experience over the years. Some have confided in him about trauma from their own pasts. The simple act of talking eases the burden. “If I hadn’t done that,” he says, “I would have eaten myself alive.”
He’s channelled his frustrations into art before, including a painting that references his experience with Mr. Sobey. He finds that one a little embarrassing, and prefers some of his other paintings, like one he completed last year called Duck on Pond. It seems chaotic at first, with a blue backdrop nearly defaced by thick slashes of black paint and swooping yellow trails. Mr. Power doesn’t see it that way at all. He calls it a work of “pure joy,” a painting about feeling comfort in solitude, like floating in the water, in peace.

Full text: With its playful, flamboyant and sometimes provocative homage to Irish playwright Oscar Wilde, Calgary’s newest luxury hotel is a standout on the often-generic hotel chain landscape.
The first hotel to be built in the city’s downtown in more than a decade, the $110-million Marriott property is named after the protagonist in Wilde’s novel The Picture of Dorian Gray. The Dorian features more than 300 luxury rooms and three restaurants in a 27-storey tower.
Filled with thoughtfully commissioned local artworks that evoke both Victorian England and Calgary’s Western roots, the hotel has been a welcome boon for the city’s hard-hit hospitality and tourism sector.
Along with other commercial developments, the Dorian is playing an integral role in the transformation of Calgary into one of Canada’s top inclusive cultural hubs, as well as one of the world’s most livable cities, according to the Economist Intelligence Unit, which ranked it third this year.
The idea for the Dorian came about when its developer – Patricia Phillips, the Calgary-born chief executive of PBA Group of Companies – realized the need for a boutique luxury hotel that could tell the story of Calgary’s evolution as a world-class city.
Previously recognized for its oil industry and “cowboy sensibility,” Calgary has grown over the past decade into a city with “a rich art and music scene, a sought-after culinary landscape and expanding industries that are attracting younger people,” Ms. Phillips says.
According to the latest figures from Calgary Economic Development, Calgary is Canada’s third most diverse city, home to 1.3 million people who speak 120 languages and representing the second-youngest median age in the country.
And with more than 500 core digital tech companies, Calgary has had the fastest pace of tech work force growth compared to anywhere in the U.S., at 2.2 per cent over the past 12 months, according to LinkedIn’s Workforce Report for Canada.
“Oscar Wilde once said, ‘Success is a science; if you have the conditions, you get the result,’ ” Ms. Phillips says.
“With the Dorian, we are building the conditions for the results we all want – a renewed level of growth and prosperity in Calgary, especially for the downtown area.”
On the other side of downtown is the $500-million expansion of Calgary’s BMO Centre, which, upon completion in 2024, will become the largest convention centre in Western Canada and the heart of the city’s newest culture and entertainment district.
“This building is a game-changer for Calgary,” says Kate Thompson, president of the Calgary Municipal Land Corporation (CMLC), which is overseeing the development project. It is being designed by Populous, a global architect company that specializes in arenas and convention centres.
“They’re really paying attention to cutting-edge place-making,” Ms. Thompson says, “focusing on building unique spaces where people can gather and pushing beyond just the annual 10day Stampede festival that takes place on-site.” Intended to be a yearround destination, the district will feature large plaza areas, retail outlets, restaurants and other amenities, with an anticipated annual economic effect of $250-million to $300-million.
In the next six months, CMLC will be announcing more details about a 250-room hotel to be built on-site, which will help house the overflow of convention attendees and visitors to the city.
“There’s never been a hotel in that area before. We’re excited about it because it’s a growth opportunity for other hotels to come on board – projects usually beget other projects,” Ms. Thompson says.
Many such projects are making sustainability a priority, such as the conversion of 65,000 square feet of unused commercial real estate at the bottom of the iconic Calgary Tower into an urban indoor farm. Local company Agriplay Ventures Inc. is installing vertical growing towers for more than 150 crops, ranging from watermelon to cucumbers.
A few steps away is the 60storey, mixed-use Telus Sky skyscraper, which opened its doors earlier this year. It not only features Canada’s largest public art display on its façade, but is also considered one of the most technologically innovative and environmentally friendly buildings in North America, having recently been nominated for the European-based International High Rise Awards.
Notable features include a rainwater recycling system that reduces the building’s municipal water demand by 70 per cent, a thermal energy system that cuts energy demand by 30 per cent and a living green wall in an 11-storey atrium.
The new Energy Transition Centre, located in the recently refurbished Ampersand building downtown, is slated to open this fall. The hub for decarbonization efforts is intended to spark innovation within the energy industry, accelerating the transition to cleaner energy alternatives while also enhancing workplace skill sets within the oil and gas sector.
Ms. Thompson recognizes the city’s boundless potential.
“All this tangible investment in the future of Calgary is giving optimism to developers who may not have touched down for the past few years but are now looking deeper and seeing the city’s transformation,” she says.
“You can feel the shift in the city; it is palpable.”

A tip from Europe: To build better rental, rethink corridors: Toronto development looks to upend the unquestioned nature of liminal spaces between elevators and apartment doors

Full text: It’s a question that comes up constantly in debates about Toronto’s intensification plans: why doesn’t the city encourage the construction of Europeanstyle mid-rise apartments? Not the pyramid-shaped confections we seem to produce in abundance, but rather boxier buildings that encircle an internal courtyard and are designed without set-backs or podiums.
Land prices are part of the explanation, as are planning policies that insist on socalled “angular planes,” an increasingly criticized urban design requirement unique to Toronto.
But if you really want to pry open this riddle, a good place to begin is the prevailing, and largely unquestioned, assumption about the nature of interior corridors – those liminal spaces between the elevators and the apartment door.
The vast majority of Toronto apartment buildings have so-called double-loaded corridors – the doors, and thus the units, open off both sides. But Jonathan Diamond, a Toronto builder whose family has owned Well Grounded Real Estate since the 1950s, and architect Pooya Baktash, co-founder of Partisans, are looking to reboot, and elevate, the unloved apartment corridor to become a defining feature of a Scarborough rental project proposed for a site owned by Diamond’s firm, at 1925 Victoria Park Rd., at the east end of the Golden Mile.
Their design involves the use of singleloaded exterior corridors overlooking the internal courtyard that will serve as the focal point for the 12-storey, 168-unit, masstimber project, which, they say, will be the first privately developed “Tier 4” (or netzero) building under the Toronto Green Standard. (TGS sets out an escalating set of performance benchmarks for new buildings. Tier 4 is the most exacting, and all the Tier 4 projects built to date are public.)
The decision, explains Mr. Baktash, wasn’t merely aesthetic. Rather, he says, the use of such external corridors unlocks an impressive array of design and operational improvements, including better unit layouts with windows on both sides, cross ventilation, greater energy efficiency, and perhaps a stronger sense of community. “Not heating or cooling the corridor reduces energy consumption significantly,” he says. “All of these things we see in Europe.”
Mr. Diamond – who has a PhD in neuroscience and worked in the tech industry before joining Well Grounded with his father, brother and a partner – describes the project as an “experiment” buttressed by intensive scientific scrutiny focused not just on the building’s energy profile, but also the experience of exposed corridors for residents.
To counter skeptics who pointed out that the project is neither a motel nor a condo in Miami, they hired the energy modelling firm RWDI to test how the structure would function in different weather conditions while satisfying so-called passive house performance standards.
That testing process appealed to Mr. Diamond’s own interest in using lab techniques to drive decisions about how to design an atypical building that can be both green and liveable.
“One example,” he says, “is using wind studies to actually understand how snow is accumulating on the site, how precipitation falls, is it too windy, what are the conditions there?” Mr. Baktash’s massing proposals, in turn, maximize sunlight in the internal courtyard while taking advantage of the sun as a passive energy source for individual units. The courtyard, he adds, creates a controlled internal climate, as well as a sense of intimacy.
Because the property was previously used for commercial tenants – a drug store and a fast-food outlet – the design isn’t as encumbered by the angular plane rules that mid-rise developers must satisfy when building on downtown main streets that back on to single family homes in lowrise neighbourhoods.
Consequently, the project can be built with mass timber, which is generally not an option for buildings that have set-backs.
It will also use prefabricated elements made in local manufacturing facilities and shipped to the construction site, thus reducing construction waste and emissions related to concrete. As Mr. Bakstah says, “Mass timber isn’t the goal; it’s a tool.”
The design further envisions a range of other energy efficiency elements, such as a sewer heat recovery, a geo-exchange system and radiant heating in the floor – a feature generally considered to be a luxury item in North America, but which is far more common in European multiunit residential buildings, where the notion of thermal comfort is tightly tethered to a building’s energy performance.
Mr. Diamond stresses that while the project is somewhat radical by Toronto standards, he’s approaching it from the perspective of a property manager who has to think about the long-term viability of his assets. He cites research showing that the lifetime operating costs of a multiunit residential building, including energy, runs to more than 40 times more than the up-front construction outlay – a ratio that justifies upfront investments in passivehouse-grade systems.
While their proposal has attracted enthusiasm inside the city’s energy and environment division, the response from the planning department has been predictable, says Mr. Baktash, adding that officials questioned the notion of a building that would rise straight up, as is entirely commonplace in many big cities. “We not do Tier 4 for the City of Toronto. We did it because the business case and the value of the project made sense.”

Full text: From an exclusive – and expensive – strip of coastline on Vancouver Island and the shores of Lake Winnipeg to a Nova Scotia property with breathtaking ocean views, here are five listings that will have you living on the water.
BRITISH COLUMBIA 5957 Sooke Rd, Sooke, B.C.
$2,850,000 If you’re in British Columbia and you want to be on the water, why not go all the way and find yourself off the Pacific coast? Easier said than done, according to listing agent Scott Piercy with Engel & Völkers Vancouver Island. He said there’s only about 1,900 waterfront properties you could own in the Victoria area and only 134 with a dock.
To be sure, some of the sites on the ocean are multimillion-dollar mansions. “We sold one out here last year for $23-million – the highest ever,” said Mr. Piercy, noting that there had only been six sales in Victoria over $10-million at that point. But a little further west along the Juan de Fuca Highway to Sooke, B.C., you can get essentially a million-dollar discount on some unique properties.
The house at 5957 Sooke Rd. is in good shape inside, but you’re paying close to $3-million because it has a huge deepwater dock that couldn’t be built today.
“In that Sooke Basin area, there’s no more development on water for docks,” said Mr. Piercy.
The current owner uses it to run his chartered fishing business (a post-retirement hobby, which he is now retiring from) and it’s about seven minutes by boat to some of the best fishing grounds on Canada’s West coast.
MANITOBA 30 Ateah Dr., Alexander, Man.
$559,900 Listing agent Eddy Noll helped his client buy this cottage on Lake Winnipeg just last year, but changing circumstances put it back onto a rapidly changing marketplace.
“Last year, the hype was a little bit greater,” he said of the fourseason cottage that’s been on listed for sale for more than a month now. “Some of us have been in the business a little longer. … It’s not always been five people fighting for every listing. Sitting 30 to 100 days, that’s the way it has always been.”
The recently updated five-bedroom house on Ateah Drive is one of the larger ones on that stretch of waterfront, and it’s one of the higher-end prices you can expect to find about an hour away from Winnipeg. The lot is thickly wooded, except for a landingstrip of a lawn that provides clear views to the water from the vaulted screened-in porch (and the four-season sunroom behind it).
There’s no dock on the rocky shore, but there’s a two-level viewing platform/deck for entertaining.
Even if the market for recreational homes is off its frenzied peak, Mr. Noll is still fielding calls from out-of-province buyers regularly – much more than he did prior to the pandemic – and has one client in B.C. waiting to sell their house before they settle on a final budget to search for their own Manitoba waterfront dream.
ONTARIO 23 Magnet Rd., Magnetawan, Ont.
$849,900 The weather is still warm in Ontario’s cottage country, but the sales prices have finally cooled a little.
“As of four months ago, getting on the water for less than a million dollars felt impossible,” said Melissa Bradbury a broker with Peryle Keye Real Estate in Bracebridge, Ont. It may have felt that way, though the Lakelands Association of Realtors reported in July that the median sale price of a waterfront property was $860,000 – 4.4-per-cent lower than the same month in 2021 but which is still way up from 2019, when the median price was $556,000 in July.
There are also fewer sales in a region that had unprecedented demand just a year ago: sales of waterfront properties were down 39 per cent compared with the same period in 2021, slid 46-percent below the five-year average and slumped 45-per-cent lower than the 10-year average.
That doesn’t mean that people are no longer buying, but rather that they take their time shopping for properties, like the family cottage outside Magnetowan, Ont., that went up for sale in July.
“You have what I would call a peninsula property,” said Ms. Bradbury, with more than 250 feet of shoreline that wraps around the main building.
The single-level cottage is clad in planed-log siding and the interior has the proportions of a midcentury-modern bungalow, but with more recent décor. Even if Ms. Bradbury doesn’t see as many remote workers relocating to the country, there’s always a purely recreational buyer keen on woods and water.
QUEBEC Lac Canot d’Écorce (private lane off chemin du Lac-Poisson), StZénon, Que.
$549,000 Minnesota brags about the fact that it is a land of 10,000 lakes on its vehicle licence plates, which is frankly amateur hour compared with Quebec, which has more than a million lakes, ponds and streams.
Quebec also has a unique layer of community management for huge tracts of wildlife areas known as “zone d’exploitation controlee” or ZEC, which took over from the private fishing and hunting clubs that controlled access to close to 78,000 square kilometers of the province until the 1978 reforms. In 1999, Quebec allowed ZECs to foster other types of economic activity than just wildlife management, after which Chantal Mireault obtained a lifetime land lease from the ZEC des Nymphes for a piece of the lakefront on Lac Canot d’Écorce about two hours north of Montreal in the Laurentian mountains.
At first Ms. Mireault built what you might call a hunting camp, a cottage barely 14 feet by 14 feet.
“We did everything from scratch there was no road: we had to cut the trees and bulldoze the land, and had to carry stuff in by boat,” she said. Then, in 2019, she embarked on a major renovation adding a two-storey structure with three bedrooms and converting the old space into a large kitchen that open onto a new main-floor living room with sweeping views of the water. Filled with natural- and paintedwood surfaces, big windows, a stone path down to the lake (with dock for kayaks or pontoon cruiser) and rebuilt to be self-sufficient with solar and propane power Ms. Mireault intended to live there full time. Instead, she now wants to travel and is selling the home (one of just 25 cottages on the 2.5-kilometre long lake) and its transferable land lease with Quebec’s do-it-yourself listing service DuProprio.
NOVA SCOTIA 2 Mary Lane, Sandy Cove, N.S.
$559,900 After starting with the Pacific coast, it’s only right to end with an oceanfront property on the Atlantic.
“Anything on any kind of water, ocean, lakes – they don’t last at all. If it’s got a brook on it, it’s worth more,” said Andrea Smith of Re/Max Banner Real Estate.
She sells a lot of waterfront property on the north cost of Nova Scotia, so she’s seen it all (and she’s also got a converted lighthouse for sale, if that’s more your speed). She said locals tend to be keen on inland lakes, but if you’re “From Away” the salty shores seem to beckon more strongly.
According to the owner of the three-bed, two-bath cozy cottage that sits on the top of the point at Sandy Cove on St. Mary’s Bay (itself an inlet in the larger Bay of Fundy), the setting is like a page out of a children’s storybook. It’s said it was built by a sea captain in 1860, and there are two almost identical homes built for his two sons that still exist elsewhere on the same cove. Exposed beams, wide wooden plank floors, a huge fireplace give it the period charm, but it was refitted with wood and pellet stoves, duct work, a heat pump and other modern amenities a little less than 20 years ago.
It was even used as a bed and breakfast for a time.
There’s no direct access to waterline on the edge of the bluff unless you felt compelled to build a dock (and why bother when down below the house is a local wharf – a commercial marina mainly used by lobster fisherman but with space for pleasure craft too). But a short stroll to the gazebo out on the edge of the property, which is connected to electrical power for light and heat, gives you a breathtaking vista of the cove and the bay. It’s the kind of view only Maritimers could get used to (and they just dropped the price by $50,000)

Full text: TORONTO Alexis Victor, real estate agent with Royal LePage Signature Realty, says investors are aggressively pitching lowball offers for cottage properties in areas around Orillia, Ont., Ramara Township and the Kawartha Lakes northeast of Toronto.
Sales and prices have already fallen steeply, she says.
“It’s such a jaw-dropper,” Ms. Victor says of the rapid decline.
“You have to go back almost a full year to price a property now.”
The median price in areas around Ramara fell for five months in a row to $680,000 in July from $875,000 in February, according to Information Technology Systems Ontario.
“Initially, there was a lot of panic,” she says, as homeowners who were contemplating a sale heard about declining prices. “Some properties were getting no showings.”
But many owners are resolute about not selling below a fixed price.
“Sellers are aggressively hanging on,” she says. “The buyers say, ‘We’ll just wait until they come around.’ ” At the high end, Paul Crammond of Chestnut Park Real Estate Ltd., says the market in Muskoka has shifted quickly in the past two months with rising interest rates and increasing concerns about the economy.
On the small lakes, Mr. Crammond is seeing fewer bidding wars and buyers taking their time before making decisions.
Sales on the lakes of Muskoka, Rosseau and Joseph have held up better, he says, despite properties on the largest lakes – dubbed the “big three” – commanding the richest prices.
“We have lost some groups of buyers even on the ‘big three’ but demand still exceeds supply.”
Mr. Crammond says cottagers on the prime lakes tend to hold onto properties. He points to a historic 1920s cottage on Lake of Bays with an asking price of $10.5million. The vintage cottage at 1023 Scotts Boathouse Rd. is on the market for the first time since 1949, he says.
The property provides 600 feet of shoreline, a two-storey boathouse and a steamer dock.
Mr. Crammond says showings increased after he recently reduced the price to $9.359-million.
Stephen Brown, senior Canada economist at Capital Economics, sees little relief in sight for the country’s housing market. He estimates the average price in Canada will slide 20 per cent from peak to trough.
The one bright spot, he says, is that new listings also seem to have dipped. And while five-year bond yields have dropped from their June peak, mortgage lenders have not passed on the decrease to borrowers.
“This seems to reflect increased concerns about real estate lending,” he says.
Paul Maranger and Christian Vermast of Sotheby’s International Realty Canada say cottage and country home listings are likely to swell if the economy worsens because owners are more likely to sell an ancillary property if they are stretched financially.
Mr. Maranger, who has a background in banking, says lenders are more conservative in providing mortgages for vacation homes – especially in uncertain times.
“They first will tighten their policies on cottages,” he says, and that could lead to more inventory in those areas.
As for the buyers in the current market, Ms. Victor says investors are keenly watching for deals on cottages and waterfront homes.
“I don’t have any cottage buyers – not one. They are all investors.”
She points to one renovated home she listed with an asking price of $1.345-million in May.
When the property didn’t sell, she made a “harsh correction” to the price and reduced it to $1.16-million.
Even then, showings were few.
Finally, Ms. Victor began receiving lowball offers in the mid$900,000s. The property sold conditionally in early August.
Ms. Victor says many investors are offering $100,000 to $150,000 below the asking price of a property.
“They offend the sellers. The sellers are not interested in working with them,” she says.
Meanwhile, Ms. Victor has some clients who pull their listings if they do not receive the sale price they were hoping to achieve.
The rental market remains extremely hot, she says, and some cottage owners can pull in $600 a night on short-term rental platforms.
She adds that many of the prospective buyers currently searching for property are aiming to do the same.
Ms. Victor has one property on Fawn Bay Road in Orillia for sale with an asking price of $965,000.
The owners are patient because the renovated three-bedroom cottage overlooking Lake Couchiching is in high demand on the rental market.
“Ideally they would like to sell it, but they’re not going to sell it unless they get a reasonable price,” she says.
Owners who rent through a property management company in the area can transfer the license to a new owner, she adds, but regulations prohibit transferring the license for a short-term rental.
She advises buyers who want the option of renting out the property to concentrate their search in Muskoka and the Kawartha Lakes because they promote tourism and their local bylaws are more amenable to shortterm rentals.
Oro-Medonte, Rama and Severn townships have stricter rules, she says.
Lenders, meanwhile, have become much tougher in their vetting of borrowers and their properties.
She has seen deals fall through because the value of a property has fallen in the time since the buyers signed an agreement.
When the appraisal comes in below the amount they agreed to pay, the lender requires the buyer to close the gap.
In other cases, buyers aren’t able to obtain a mortgage because a property is too small or too seasonal. Some sit on piers instead of a foundation.
“Until you can make it winterized, you can’t get a mortgage,” she says.
In recent days, Ms. Victor has noticed a slight increase in buyer activity as September approaches. The change is subtle, however, and she’s not sure if the market will regain momentum any time soon.

Vancouver offers to extend leases to residents of 13 buildings in False Creek South: After years of debate, proposed 20-year deal is shorter than the 99 years owners of strata leaseholds requested

Full text: VANCOUVER After years of uncertainty, the owners of 13 strata leasehold buildings in Vancouver’s False Creek South neighbourhood have been offered extensions on their leases with the city.
The local government is offering an additional 20 years on top of the existing leases, which is shorter than the 99-year leases the owners had originally requested – but at least they’re on the path, as one False Creek South resident put it.
City council and the board members of the Strata Leaseholders Society, which is the bargaining agent for the majority of strata leaseholders that formed in 2018, are in support of the extension offer, which is part of a lease renewal package for the stratas on city-owned land.
There are 669 leases for the 13 strata residences that sit along the False Creek shoreline, between Cambie and Burrard Street bridges. The society members will vote on the package on Sept. 21. If the group’s members accept the proposal, then a modified lease that includes the 20year extension would be offered to the 669 strata leasehold owners who could individually choose to take it or leave it.
Society chair Richard Marchant said his group has been working all year on the proposal after negotiations started with the city staff last fall.
“What’s really important is that we have a proposal in front of us, and that the board of directors for the society supports it, and city council supports it,” he said. “That is a really important step forward from what has been a lengthy process. When you watch the years tick down it’s hard.”
The leases started in the 1970s when the community was built out and most have a term of 60 years. Modern-day leaseholds generally have 99-year terms. Depending on the strata building, the current leases end in 2036, 2040 and 2046, and the offer would add another 20 years onto their lease terms.
Leasehold owners would pay a lump-sum rent prepayment based on calculated land values, which are part of the negotiations. However, some leaseholders are disputing the land value calculations and the prepayment amounts in a dispute that largely focuses on how the city is calculating floor area.
Cameron Fast, council president for the strata at 658 Leg in Boot Square, wrote a letter to the city to dispute the city floor area calculation. He claims the calculation for payments for each owner in his strata will be, on average, $12,000 more than what they should be paying.
“This is a substantial amount of money for the owners,” he writes.
Robert Renger, a society director, argues that the city’s calculations would overcharge two stratas by an average of $12,000 a unit, while two other stratas would see overcharges of $5,000 and $7,000 on average.
The city did not respond to questions about the dispute over the prepayments.
More than 20 years ago, there was a similar dispute over floor area calculation. In that case, the city eventually paid refunds to 35 leaseholders. Mr. Renger, a former senior planner for the city of Burnaby who has lived in False Creek South since the 1980s, was involved in the original dispute and believes a similar miscalculation has occurred.
The city declined to comment on specifics of the package, which it said in an e-mailed statement was “the result of mutually agreed negotiations with the strata lessees’ negotiation team.”
False Creek South is former industrial land that was acquired by the city and redeveloped in the 1970s as a mix of affordable housing types, including rental co-ops, leasehold strata, nonmarket rentals and some social housing. The apartments and townhouses have long been a mix of one-third low income, one-third middle income and one-third higher income.
The neighbourhood is targeted for more density and residents have banded together to come up with a plan to add significant infill and population growth, called RePlan. However, the city released its own plan last year to boost market housing and tear down a lot of the existing affordable housing and relocate it to the busy arterial along 6th Avenue, away from the shoreline. That plan received significant community opposition and council rejected it in favour of something more in line with False Creek South’s spirit of affordability and community. Staff is expected to report back to council in early 2023.
But for the stratas and the coops, life has felt precarious as the end of their leases approach without renewals. Lease agreements are necessary in order to obtain affordable mortgages and to borrow money to do repairs.
The majority of rental co-ops are still without extensions, and many of them expire between 2036 and 2037.
The co-ops have been watching their leasehold strata neighbours work out a deal and they hope this might be a sign that they, too, will obtain extensions. But for many years, the future of the neighbourhood has been up in the air, and the city’s original plan released last fall showed that the co-ops would be torn down and redeveloped. It remains to be seen what the city will plan for them next.
Complicating the matter is that the city is both landlord and land-use planner, which has made lease renewals a complicated issue that’s dragged on for years.
The stratas “have a path now – maybe not as long as people wanted, but it’s clarity,” said Nancy Hannum, co-chair of the Co-op Committee of False Creek South Neighbourhood Association’s RePlan. “We don’t have that.”
Ms. Hannum said there are five co-op buildings awaiting renewals, and until then, they have an uncertain future.
“All of us in False Creek wanted extensions of the co-op leases for the life of the building because they are affordable,” said Ms. Hannum. “What we have been told is our housing is going to be displaced for more stratas, and new stratas can be built because they are feasible, whereas non-profit housing is dependent on significant sources of government funding. That’s really high risk for the city, to risk this affordable housing.”
If they could also obtain 20year extensions, that would bring the co-ops with 40-year leases to 60 years, and the 60year lease co-ops to a total of 80 years.
“That seems reasonable. It would maintain the housing for at least another 20 to 40 years, and offer good affordable housing, with family sized units.”
The city said in its statement that it had been working on a citywide co-op lease renewal framework that was approved by council in 2021. Co-ops with imminent expiries are a top priority, the city said, pointing to plans to begin negotiations with one False Creek South co-op that has a lease expiring in 2024.
“The remaining co-op leases in False Creek South expire in 2036 or later, and all lease negotiations will be considered in alignment with plans to redevelop False Creek South as they are formed,” said the statement.
Ms. Hannum knows the future challenge will be maintaining the existing tight-knit community, which is more than half nonmarket housing, including the co-ops.
“That’s the fight that’s going to happen under the planning process, and that’s what we are gearing up for,” says Ms. Hannum, who is a retired librarian.
“We know we have to be prepared to have that discussion.
“I’m not opposed to new buildings along 6th Avenue.
What I’m opposed to is ripping apart the community and ripping apart affordable housing.
Why not work with these buildings that are so viable and the existing communities? These are well-managed co-ops, 40 years of good management. Why not work with that?”

Full text: 2883 Point Grey Rd., Vancouver KITSILANO Asking price: $25.8-million (April, 2022) Selling price: $22-million (May, 2022) Days on market: 18 Taxes: $106,198 (2021) Listing agent: Gregg Baker, Engel & Völkers THE ACTION Agent Gregg Baker said it’s the highest-priced sale in Metro Vancouver so far this year for a house listed on the Multiple Listings Service. If properties in this price range come up for sale, they are usually redeveloped and the owners stay for the long term, which had been the seller’s intention in this case.
“We haven’t seen a new modern build offered for sale for years and years,” Mr. Baker said. “It’s very custom, and the design is intentionally understated by the previous owner.”
The sellers sold because they needed to relocate to the North Shore. Mr. Baker received one offer from local buyers, who are empty nesters planning to live in the house. Mr. Baker had 15 groups view the property by appointment.
WHAT THEY GOT Designed by Measured Architecture, the 5,346square-foot contemporary house with ocean views is located on Vancouver’s Golden Mile, the exclusive oceanfront stretch of Point Grey Road that is closed to public traffic.
The high-tech, contemporary house was designed for the seller just two years ago. It has four bedrooms, six bathrooms, a four-car heated garage, tons of natural light, over-height ceilings, concrete and white-washed oak floors, a chef’s kitchen, decks, a fire pit and an outdoor shower.
There is a roughed-in elevator.
THE AGENT’S TAKE Mr. Baker said homes in this price range can sell in days, weeks or months – it’s just a matter of finding that one buyer. He would have preferred to have spent more time in the home.
“I enjoyed the house and it sold maybe a little faster than I would have liked. It was so great being in there; it had so much serenity.”
The deal completed Aug. 4.

A tip from Europe: To build better rental, rethink corridors: Toronto development looks to upend the unquestioned nature of liminal spaces between elevators and apartment doors

Full text: It’s a question that comes up constantly in debates about Toronto’s intensification plans: why doesn’t the city encourage the construction of Europeanstyle mid-rise apartments? Not the pyramid-shaped confections we seem to produce in abundance, but rather boxier buildings that encircle an internal courtyard and are designed without set-backs or podiums.
Land prices are part of the explanation, as are planning policies that insist on socalled “angular planes,” an increasingly criticized urban design requirement unique to Toronto.
But if you really want to pry open this riddle, a good place to begin is the prevailing, and largely unquestioned, assumption about the nature of interior corridors – those liminal spaces between the elevators and the apartment door.
The vast majority of Toronto apartment buildings have so-called double-loaded corridors – the doors, and thus the units, open off both sides. But Jonathan Diamond, a Toronto builder whose family has owned Well Grounded Real Estate since the 1950s, and architect Pooya Baktash, co-founder of Partisans, are looking to reboot, and elevate, the unloved apartment corridor to become a defining feature of a Scarborough rental project proposed for a site owned by Diamond’s firm, at 1925 Victoria Park Rd., at the east end of the Golden Mile.
Their design involves the use of singleloaded exterior corridors overlooking the internal courtyard that will serve as the focal point for the 12-storey, 168-unit, masstimber project, which, they say, will be the first privately developed “Tier 4” (or netzero) building under the Toronto Green Standard. (TGS sets out an escalating set of performance benchmarks for new buildings. Tier 4 is the most exacting, and all the Tier 4 projects built to date are public.)
The decision, explains Mr. Baktash, wasn’t merely aesthetic. Rather, he says, the use of such external corridors unlocks an impressive array of design and operational improvements, including better unit layouts with windows on both sides, cross ventilation, greater energy efficiency, and perhaps a stronger sense of community. “Not heating or cooling the corridor reduces energy consumption significantly,” he says. “All of these things we see in Europe.”
Mr. Diamond – who has a PhD in neuroscience and worked in the tech industry before joining Well Grounded with his father, brother and a partner – describes the project as an “experiment” buttressed by intensive scientific scrutiny focused not just on the building’s energy profile, but also the experience of exposed corridors for residents.
To counter skeptics who pointed out that the project is neither a motel nor a condo in Miami, they hired the energy modelling firm RWDI to test how the structure would function in different weather conditions while satisfying so-called passive house performance standards.
That testing process appealed to Mr. Diamond’s own interest in using lab techniques to drive decisions about how to design an atypical building that can be both green and liveable.
“One example,” he says, “is using wind studies to actually understand how snow is accumulating on the site, how precipitation falls, is it too windy, what are the conditions there?” Mr. Baktash’s massing proposals, in turn, maximize sunlight in the internal courtyard while taking advantage of the sun as a passive energy source for individual units. The courtyard, he adds, creates a controlled internal climate, as well as a sense of intimacy.
Because the property was previously used for commercial tenants – a drug store and a fast-food outlet – the design isn’t as encumbered by the angular plane rules that mid-rise developers must satisfy when building on downtown main streets that back on to single family homes in lowrise neighbourhoods.
Consequently, the project can be built with mass timber, which is generally not an option for buildings that have set-backs.
It will also use prefabricated elements made in local manufacturing facilities and shipped to the construction site, thus reducing construction waste and emissions related to concrete. As Mr. Bakstah says, “Mass timber isn’t the goal; it’s a tool.”
The design further envisions a range of other energy efficiency elements, such as a sewer heat recovery, a geo-exchange system and radiant heating in the floor – a feature generally considered to be a luxury item in North America, but which is far more common in European multiunit residential buildings, where the notion of thermal comfort is tightly tethered to a building’s energy performance.
Mr. Diamond stresses that while the project is somewhat radical by Toronto standards, he’s approaching it from the perspective of a property manager who has to think about the long-term viability of his assets. He cites research showing that the lifetime operating costs of a multiunit residential building, including energy, runs to more than 40 times more than the up-front construction outlay – a ratio that justifies upfront investments in passivehouse-grade systems.
While their proposal has attracted enthusiasm inside the city’s energy and environment division, the response from the planning department has been predictable, says Mr. Baktash, adding that officials questioned the notion of a building that would rise straight up, as is entirely commonplace in many big cities. “We not do Tier 4 for the City of Toronto. We did it because the business case and the value of the project made sense.”

Stories of Canada’s red-hot rental market stoke fear: As interest rates climb, immigration booms and in-person life returns, cost to rent is surging

Full text: Weeks into his search, Oliver South is wondering how long he’ll have to look before he finally lands a place to live during the last year of his undergraduate degree.
The mechanical engineering student, who attends the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, has reached out to about 35 different people who’ve listed rooms for rent. About half don’t respond, he said. The other half make it clear he’s up against stiff competition.
One person raised the listing price by $100 a month in the middle of the conversation, according to messages Mr. South shared with The Globe and Mail. Another person, subletting a unit rented and managed by UBC, never listed a price at all, inviting a furious bidding war for a coveted room on campus that’s walking distance from class.
Ultimately, the asking price reached at least $1,750 a month, more than 80 per cent higher than what the university charges the original tenant.
“I know it’s way above the price but it seems like people are willing to pay that much and it’s hard for me to say no to that,” the sublessor wrote in messages to Mr. South that he shared with The Globe and posted on Twitter. “So yes that’s the current offer I have if you wanna beat that.”
When reached for comment, UBC said in a statement it cannot stop students from subletting its units above the original rate, as the university isn’t a party to those agreements. However, the university said sublet agreements must meet certain requirements and it approves “very few” sublets during the academic year.
Mr. South tried to bargain with the person to no avail. Based on other listings for similar units, he said he wouldn’t be surprised if the price went up after he bowed out.
“That’s just the market right now,” he said.
And it’s not just the case in Vancouver, where calls for affordable housing have echoed for years.
Across Canada, renters searching for a home are wrestling with a red-hot market in which competition is fierce, prices seem to rise in real time, and landlords, in the words of Mr. South, “hold all the cards.”
A confluence of factors are to blame for the spike in rental demand. Chief among them are fastrising interest rates, according to Shaun Hildebrand, president of Urbanation Inc., a Toronto-based real estate research firm. As those rates have cooled home sales and made it more difficult to qualify for a mortgage, many prospective buyers have been trapped in a rental market that’s already short on supply.
Meanwhile, record-low unemployment, renewed immigration and a return to the office and classroom – all benchmarks of Canada’s recovery from COVID-19 – have further expanded the pool of renters after a lull in rental demand during the early days of the pandemic.
In July, the average monthly rent in Canada had risen by 10.4 per cent – to $1,934 – compared with the same time last year, according to a report by Rentals.ca.
However, some cities have seen costs surge well above the national average over the past 12 months.
In Victoria, rents for all property types reached an average of $2,667 in July – a 27-per-cent increase from the year before. Hamilton; Kitchener, Ont.; Toronto; London, Ont.; and Burnaby, B.C., all followed close behind, with rents increasing by roughly a quarter over the previous year in each city.
Meanwhile, in Vancouver, the average rent in July was 16 per cent higher than a year earlier, sitting at just under $3,118 a month, the most expensive rent, on average, in the country.
In Calgary, that figure jumped to $1,797 in July, an increase of 18 per cent. That’s due in large part to a strong return of international and interprovincial immigration, according to Michael Mak, a senior analyst at the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp.
And in Toronto, the average rent for all residential property types rose to $2,691 in July, nearly 24 per cent higher than that month last year.
An Urbanation report last month found rents in the Greater Toronto Area had risen at the fastest pace on record in the second quarter of this year. At the time, Urbanation said the GTA’s vacancy rate sat at 1.4 per cent, down from around 5 per cent a year ago.
That comes as no surprise to Julia Belittchenko. She and her partner have been searching for a new home “anywhere along a commuting line” in Toronto since June. She estimates they’ve contacted more than 200 places.
“It’s very, very discouraging,” said the 25-year-old, who’s an academic administrator at a camp for international students.
“I’m working a full-time job, and then […] any free second I have, I’m doing my other fulltime job of finding a place to live. I am constantly on every single site looking.”
So far, affordability and unprecedented competition have been her biggest challenges, Ms. Belittchenko said. After three different viewings, within minutes, she was informed that each place had been snatched up.
The expectations of landlords also seem to have gone up, she said. On top of providing recent pay stubs and multiple references, many landlords are now requiring credit reports, co-signers, employer contact information, photo identification and, for university students, proof of enrolment.
The rental market is beginning to feel like a lottery, said Tessa, a Vancouver woman in her 30s.
(The Globe is not identifying her or using her real name so she could speak candidly about her apartment search.)
A few weeks ago, she arrived to a viewing with nearly 25 people waiting outside the place. When the crowd learned they’d be shown the apartment in small groups, some began fighting to get ahead.
The others swapped war stories. One young woman carrying a laminated calling card said she’d been on the hunt for three months. By the time she arrived to one viewing, the woman said, the listing price had suddenly jumped by $300.
Last week, Tessa thought she may have found a place, though she wasn’t sure whether she could afford it. Until it fell through, she was willing to spend hundreds of dollars more a month than she had originally budgeted. Due to the impact her search has had on her mental health, she felt like she couldn’t afford to keep looking.
When might Canadian renters get some relief?
In the short term, Mr. Hildebrand and Mr. Mak both agree a recession is the likeliest way rents will decline, or at least stop rising.
However, in the long run, Canada needs significantly more rental development to lessen the gap between supply and demand. And due to the rising cost of financing, construction materials and labour, it’s up to governments to introduce more incentives for purpose-built rental construction, Mr. Hildebrand said.
But Dr. Penny Gurstein, director of UBC’s Housing Research Collaborative, insists only the right kind of supply will address the country’s housing crisis.
Much of the rental stock built today is far too expensive for many renters, she said. Dr. Gurstein believes community land trusts, in which a non-profit group owns and maintains property on behalf of a local community in order to provide affordable housing, could be one solution.
The situation is dire, and governments must innovate if they want to see meaningful progress, she said.
It’s become much more difficult for young people to leave home, Dr. Gurstein noted. Mr. South, Ms. Belittchenko and Tessa can attest – they’re all currently living with their parents, despite their best efforts to move out.
That reality portends something much darker, she said, hampering not only an individual’s ability to blossom, but also the vibrancy and culture young people offer neighbourhoods.

Full text: Liz Cheney conceded defeat in her congressional renomination bid on Tuesday, as Wyoming Republicans gave their tacit endorsement to Donald Trump’s attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election.
The former U.S. president campaigned vociferously against Ms. Cheney in Tuesday’s primary – part of an continuing effort to take revenge on party dissidents ahead of a potential 2024 comeback bid. The three-term Wyoming congresswoman is vice-chair of the legislative committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol by Mr. Trump’s supporters.
Polls throughout the race showed Ms. Cheney trailing Trump-backed challenger Harriet Hageman by more than 20 percentage points. Ms. Cheney conceded early in the counting, with Ms. Hageman comfortably ahead.
In the election, Ms. Cheney took direct aim at the slide toward authoritarianism she said the ex-president represents, accusing him in her final campaign ad of “trying to destroy our republic.”
This unyielding opposition to Mr. Trump has fuelled speculation that Ms. Cheney is lining up a 2024 presidential campaign. On election day, she vowed to continue working to stop Mr. Trump, whatever the cost to her own career.
“Today, no matter what the outcome is, is certainly the beginning of a battle that is going to continue,” she said after voting Tuesday. “We’re facing a moment where our democracy really is under attack.”
Mr. Trump currently faces escalating criminal investigations of his conduct in office. Last week, the FBI searched his Mar-a-Lago estate.
The vote in this deep-red state is only the latest contest in which the former president has sought to tighten his grip on the party. Of 10 House Republicans who, like Ms. Cheney, voted to impeach him last year, three others have previously fallen to Mr. Trump’s candidates in their primaries.
Two survived their nomination contests, and four did not run for re-election.
Ms. Cheney is Republican royalty, a former official in George W.
Bush’s administration and daughter of ex-vice president Dick Cheney. She built a reputation in office as a conservative stalwart, championing guns, opposing abortion and supporting the oil industry. In Congress, she voted with Mr. Trump more than 90 per cent of the time.
But the 56-year-old lawyer became one of few prominent Republicans to break with him over his attempts to throw out his 2020 election loss. The party’s congressional caucus has since stripped her of her post as the third-highest-ranked Republican in the House, while the Wyoming state party kicked her out entirely.
In a state that gave Mr. Trump nearly 70 per cent of its vote in 2020, many of Ms. Cheney’s constituents see her break with him as an unforgiveable sin.
“No true Republican would work with Democrats to take down a Republican president,” said Shianne Huston, a 56-yearold antique store owner from Mills, Wyo. “On Jan. 6, the government wasn’t threatened, it wasn’t an armed takeover. It’s just overblown.”
Tom Mattimore, a 72-year-old retired boot maker in Laramie, Wyo., said Ms. Cheney was already in trouble over doubts that she was spending much time in the state, the country’s least populous, whose 600,000 residents are used to regular contact with their elected representatives. “Liz Cheney hasn’t been around much. We don’t like that in these parts,” Mr. Mattimore said.
He said he believed the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago, which recovered classified documents Mr. Trump took from the White House, was part of a sinister plot: “We have an intelligence community that is actively engaged in trying to overthrow the United States.”
Still, Ms. Cheney held on to at least some of her supporters. At a community centre in Jackson, the touristy mountain resort town close to her home, many voters professed admiration for their congresswoman’s commitment to principle.
“She stood up and had the courage to, in my opinion, do what’s right. She knew what she was getting into, but she did it anyway,” said C.J. Johnson, a 32year-old biologist.
Warren Van Genderen said he agreed with Mr. Trump on policy, particularly his tough talk on China and his support for the oil and gas industry. But Mr. Van Genderen, 84, had always felt Mr. Trump was “a bozo, a buffoon” and “not presidential.” The now-former president’s actions on Jan. 6 solidified his alarm.
“It took a lot of chutzpah for Cheney to take on Trump. I hope she can continue,” he said as he stood in the afternoon sunshine after casting his ballot. “He does a disservice to the Republican Party.”
The fault lines running through the party nationally are particularly acute in Wyoming. A far-right faction led by state party chair Frank Eathorne has taken over the local leadership apparatus in recent years.
Pat Sweeney, a 68-year-old Republican state legislator who backed Ms. Cheney in the primary, said the state party has made a concerted effort to push out moderates by recruiting candidates for primary campaigns focused on culture-war hot-buttons, such as fighting protections for transgender people.
“A number of us have really been nailed by the state party.
There’s a real movement to get people like me out,” he said at a Republican Party event in a park in Casper, Wyo.
Part of Ms. Cheney’s re-election strategy involved reaching out to Democrats and independents, urging them to change their party registrations to Republican to vote for her.
Kimberly Holloway, a 52-yearold Casper lawyer and former democratic socialist member of the city’s council, made the switch.
“I disagree with Liz Cheney on 99 per cent of things, but on this she is standing on the right side of history,” she said. “This issue overshadows everything else. The attitude of the Republican Party is a threat to our democracy, to our citizens, to our elections.”

Full text: The last time Mark Armstrong saw Liz Cheney was three years ago.
The Wyoming Republican organizer pulled the congresswoman aside after she gave a speech at a local party event. He told her that he hoped she would one day become the first woman elected U.S. president.
So it was with as much disappointment as anger that he watched her vote to impeach Donald Trump over the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.
“Liz has one of the most conservative records in Congress. She’s not a liberal. She’s very right wing,” said Mr. Armstrong, a 65year-old geotechnical engineer in Laramie, Wyo. “But I cannot vote for her, I cannot support her after Jan. 6.”
Ms. Cheney’s trajectory from rising Republican star to party apostate may reach its conclusion Tuesday in the primary election for this deep-red state’s lone House seat. Polls shows her trailing Trump-backed challenger Harriet Hageman by more than 20 percentage points.
The vote is a major inflection point for the Republicans. If a conservative as rockribbed as Ms. Cheney is banished to the political wilderness, it will cement Mr. Trump’s hold on the party.
It is all unfolding as the former president mulls a 2024 comeback bid, and a week after the FBI’s search of his Mar-a-Lago estate in one of the expanding criminal probes of his conduct.
Far from playing down her dissent, Ms. Cheney has campaigned consistently on her work with the congressional committee investigating Mr. Trump’s efforts to overturn his re-election loss. In a series of hearings this summer, the panel laid out bombshell evidence that he worked to foment insurrection.
“America cannot remain free if we abandon the truth. The lie that the 2020 presidential election was stolen is insidious,” Ms. Cheney said in her final election ad.
“History has shown us over and over again how these types of poisonous lies destroy free nations.”
Around this western state of prairie, desert and mountains – where 600,000 people are spread across a landmass the size of Britain – many Republicans said they hoped Ms. Cheney’s defeat would signal a purge of those disloyal to Mr. Trump.
“I think the election is going to sweep away all the RINOs – Republicans in name only,” said Zaida Zoller, a 69-year-old paralegal in the ranching town of Buffalo.
Every time she sees one of Ms. Cheney’s campaign signs, Ms. Zoller said, she shouts “Liz Cheney’s a traitor” out her car window.
“It’s not really a Republican Party any more, it’s a Trump Party,” said Susan Martin, 58, a retired teacher with a Hageman sign in the plain of sagebrush surrounding her rural grey clapboard house.
“You know who really should have been impeached? Every Democrat in office who stole the election,” said Terri Yeadon, a fiftysomething voter in Casper.
Added her son, Nathaniel, 21: “Liz Cheney needs to burn in hell.”
For the congresswoman’s remaining supporters, such talk is the latest marker of the country’s slide toward authoritarianism in the Trump era.
“He’s dishonest. He’s arrogant.
He’ll do anything to get into office. Cheney is standing up for our constitution and she’s hopefully going to bring him to justice,” said Richard Wilson, 77, a retired heavy engine mechanic and lifelong Republican.
Standing on the steps of his bungalow in Casper, a 59,000strong oil town, Mr. Wilson pointed to two houses on the block that had Cheney lawn signs stolen in the past week. Another sign a few streets away was vandalized with spray paint, Ms. Cheney’s name crossed out and “don’t vote RINO” written underneath.
Randy Ford, 70, one of the few voters still undecided ahead of the primary, said he backed Mr. Trump through two elections, enthused with his policies on cutting taxes and renegotiating trade deals. But Mr. Ford soured on the former president when he tried to reverse his 2020 loss.
“I just wish the Department of Justice would jump in there and help the committee resolve all this,” said Mr. Ford, a 70-year-old retired financial planner, at a gathering of Republicans in a Casper park. “If Trump’s guilty, I sure wouldn’t want him running again. What would we be saying to our children? That it’s okay to cheat and lie?” No one better illustrates the party’s coalescing around Mr. Trump than Ms. Hageman. In 2016, she referred to the billionaire as “racist and xenophobic” in e-mails leaked to The New York Times. Now, she describes him as the “greatest president of my lifetime” and the 2020 election as “rigged.”
Ms. Cheney’s slim hope of survival rests on a Wyoming electoral rule that allows voters to switch their party affiliation at any time before an election. Her campaign has been actively encouraging Democrats to temporarily join the Republicans to back her.
It’s a particularly ironic strategy given Ms. Cheney’s history as a stalwart of Republican orthodoxy: anti-abortion, pro-guns and a supporter of fossil fuels in a state where oil, gas and coal dominate the economy. In Congress, Ms. Cheney voted with Mr. Trump more than 90 per cent of the time.
Jane Ifland, a Casper social-justice activist, has been on the opposite side of nearly every issue from Ms. Cheney. She even recalls confronting the congresswoman over single-payer health care at an open house a few years ago.
But in an advance poll last week, Ms. Ifland voted for a Republican for the first time in her 77 years.
“I was crying about it,” she said.
“I certainly wasn’t voting for any policy that Cheney supports, but I was voting because I want to continue to live in a democracy.”
There may not be enough Democrats for this to make a difference in Wyoming, which Mr. Trump carried with nearly 70 per cent of the vote in 2020. But it has stoked dark talk among Republicans of election rigging.
At a meeting of the local party in Laramie, organizers expressed fears that elections workers were encouraging Democrats to switch their voter registrations. They warned that Democrats might bus people from out of state to vote illegally.
“We’re going to make sure that caravans aren’t coming across that border,” said Katrina Cox, 52, the county party vice-chair. “The crossover vote is a big dinger. I think it’s cheating.”
Others in the room said Ms. Cheney’s problems in the state predated her impeachment vote.
Having spent much of her life in Washington, she has faced questions about her ties to Wyoming since her first election in 2016.
“I’ve listened to Harriet Hageman speak four times in the last year. I’ve never met Liz. That’s a problem,” said Brandon Newman, 37, who works as an instructor at a trade school.
Ms. Cheney’s status as local political royalty cuts both ways. Her father, former vice-president Dick Cheney, made an ad for his daughter in which he excoriated Mr. Trump as a “coward” and the largest threat to democracy in U.S.
history. But as a chief architect of the disastrous invasion of Iraq, he is a persistent reminder of one reason so many Republicans rejected the party establishment and embraced Mr. Trump in the first place.
Amid an avalanche of threats over her opposition to Mr. Trump, Ms. Cheney has kept a low profile in the state. She does not hold public campaign events, instead opting for private gatherings in the homes of supporters. She has been assigned a police bodyguard.
Her endgame is currently unclear. In speeches and interviews, she has seemed to tacitly concede that running on her opposition to Mr. Trump will cost her House seat, stoking speculation that her real aim is to set up a 2024 presidential bid. In her final ad, however, she explained her decision as a simple commitment to stop Mr. Trump, whatever the cost.
“Millions of Americans across our nation – Republicans, Democrats, independents – stand united in the cause of freedom,” she said. “We are stronger, more dedicated and more determined than those trying to destroy our republic. This is our great task and we will prevail.”

Full text: Viterra Ltd., the global grain company that counts two of Canada’s big pension plans as major investors, has continued to work in the Russian market despite other companies exiting the country – and over the objections of its own staff in Ukraine.
Viterra’s Russian business holdings include a grain-storage terminal co-owned with VTB, a Russian bank that has been under Canadian sanctions since 2014, when Russia seized and illegally annexed Crimea.
An industry source said the company separately ignored warnings from its own staff about continuing its operations at two facilities in Ukraine, where workers feared for their safety if Russia targeted the facilities for attack. The Globe and Mail is not naming the industry source because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter.
The same source said Viterra’s Ukrainian staff were also angry that the company continued operations in Russia after the Feb. 24 invasion.
The risks attached to the decision to keep operating in Ukraine were made plain in June when Viterra’s sunflower seed oil terminal in the Black Sea port of Mykolaiv was struck by a Russian cruise missile. One Viterra employee was injured in the attack, which saw two of the company’s oil containers explode into flames, sending debris flying into the surrounding neighbourhood.
Viterra, headquartered in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, but with significant operations in Regina, traces its roots to Canada’s grain co-operatives and the Saskatchewan Wheat Pool. Glencore PLC, an Anglo-Swiss commodity trading giant, bought the Toronto Stock Exchange-traded Viterra in 2013, and folded its own agricultural division into the company. In 2021, it recorded US$40.7-billion in revenue, $7.3-billion of it from Canada, and has nearly 1,600 employees in this country.
Its shareholders now include many Canadian pensioners, via the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) and the British Columbia Investment Management Corp. (BCI), which combined to buy a stake in the private company in 2016.
CPP Investments owns 39.99 per cent of Viterra, while BCI owns 9.99 per cent.
Glencore owns 49.99 per cent, with the rest held by Viterra’s management.
FROM B1 The Russian and Ukrainian operations illustrate the perils for Canadian companies, and their major investors, from conducting business in the region after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Owning businesses in Russia is widely seen internationally as supporting Vladimir Putin’s regime. And operating in Ukraine subjects employees to immense safety risks as Russia continues a military campaign that has targeted the citizens and the economic engines of the country.
Soon after the military assault began, CPPIB and BCI, as well as all other large Canadian pensions, were quick to disavow investment in Russia, issuing public statements in response to Canadians’ concerns about propping up Mr. Putin’s economy.
At the time, CPPIB called its Russian holdings “insignificant,” saying it had “made a deliberate decision” several years prior to avoid Russia as “one of our markets.” BCI chief executive Gordon J. Fyfe said on March 1 that the manager was “actively working to sell the remaining Russian securities from our clients’ portfolios.”
But the two pensions, like their peers, were addressing the issue of whether they owned Russianheadquartered companies, infrastructure or real estate in the country. Generally, Canadian pension funds also acknowledged that they owned shares in multinational companies that may have been doing business in Russia – and it would take time for those companies to explore whether to make an exit.
That would include Viterra, a Dutch-Canadian company that had just US$241-million in assets in Russia at the year-end of 2021, roughly 1 per cent of its nearly US$20-billion in total assets. (It listed its Ukrainian operations at US$417-million, a little more than 2 per cent of the balance sheet.)
The Viterra investment is likely worth billions to CPPIB and hundreds of millions of dollars to BCI, based on current market valuations of other publicly traded agricultural companies.
Before the invasion, Ukraine was the world’s fifth-largest grain exporter. The country’s inability to export staples such as wheat and sunflower-seed oil has helped propel skyrocketing food prices around the world.
Asked why Viterra continued to operate in Russia, Jeff Cockwill, the company’s vice-president of corporate affairs for North America, said in a statement that the company had suspended any new development and expansion projects in the country.
However, “disruptions to the global food supply chain are having a disproportionate impact on the people who live in the lowestincome nations of the world. As an exporter of essential agricultural commodities, we believe that it is our duty as an industry leader to continue providing food and feed products for people in need.”
Viterra said it owns 50 per cent of the Taman grain terminal in Russia, with the remaining 50 per cent owned by a holding company of which VTB, the Russian bank, is a minority 45-per-cent shareholder. “As such, because VTB is only a minority shareholder in this holding company, the Taman grain terminal is not a sanctioned entity.”
VTB bought into the Taman terminal in March, 2020. Demetra-Holding LLC, then described in news reports as a subsidiary of VTB, purchased the 50-per-cent stake from Ukraine agricultural company Kernel for US$65-million in cash. According to S&P Global Market Intelligence, two Russian entities – Agronova JSC and Marathon Group – were VTB’s partners in Demetra-Holding LLC.
Viterra’s Mr. Cockwill said VTB sold 5 per cent of its stake in Demetra-Holding LLC in February of this year to slip below the 50-percent threshold.
VTB, which is also under sanctions by the United States and the European Union, is Russia’s second-largest bank. Since the start of the year, it has had its international assets frozen and has been cut off from the SWIFT system of banking payments.
“Viterra does not conduct any prohibited business activities with VTB in respect of the Taman grain terminal, or otherwise,” Viterra said. “It is also worth noting that agriculture commodities are not included under the current EU and US sanctions.”
CPPIB, which holds two of the company’s six board seats, and BCI, which holds one, declined to answer most of The Globe’s specific questions about Viterra’s Russian and Ukrainian businesses, referring them to the company.
Michel Leduc, CPPIB’s global head of public affairs and communications, said Viterra is “the exact type of operation helping the world address what is arguably one of its biggest challenges today: a global food supply crisis.
The pandemic, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, inflation and climate change have conspired to cause this crisis. … No responsible shareholder should ever force operational decisions that might cause greater harm or exacerbate challenges such as a global food crisis, noting the real potential for famine in parts of the world.”
Mr. Leduc said the idea that Viterra’s VTB relationship could run afoul of sanctions is “misinformed and misplaced.”
Gwen-Ann Chittenden, BCI’s vice-president, corporate stakeholder engagement, acknowledged the fund manager’s stake in Viterra and said BCI “can confirm that Viterra is committed to the safety of its employees and global food security.”
The safety of its Ukrainian employees was in question, however, even before the late-June Russian attack on the Mykolaiv terminal.
Viterra had stopped full-scale operations in Kharkiv because the city was on the front lines.
Still, more than 20 people were working on the site that day, the industry source says. The source described it as “a miracle” that more people weren’t injured and that nobody died.
The industry source said the giant metal vats of sunflower oil at the Mykolaiv terminal are dangerously flammable even in peacetime, and that “you just don’t” continue working at a facility like that in the middle of a war.
With Viterra unable to get its product out by sea because of a Russian blockade, the company is still working – even after the attack – to get the oil stored in the port terminal out of Ukraine on trucks.
Viterra’s Mr. Cockwill said the company has a crisis-management team in daily contact with local management to understand the risks and “is ready to resume business operations in Ukraine if it is safe to do so. We are continuing to monitor the situation daily.” reminded employees that they have the right to stop work if they feel it is dangerous for themselves, the people around them, as well as the work environment,” he said. “There are no negative consequences if an employee chooses to stop work.”
He said Viterra is “not aware of any concerns raised” through the communications channels it established for employees in Ukraine to raise concerns, including safety-related issues.
Mr. Cockwill said that since the war began, Viterra has continued to pay the full salaries of all its employees in Ukraine, “regardless if they have expressed willingness to work on site or not.”
The company has committed US$3-million ($3.8-million) for direct support to its workers and humanitarian aid to the wider Ukrainian population; donated 3,000 metric tonnes of milling wheat to be made into flour and distributed across Ukraine; and given 50,000 (about $65,500) to the Okhmatdyt Children’s Hospital in Kyiv.
Andy Hunder, the president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Ukraine, said he had emailed Viterra senior management in March, shortly after the Russian invasion began, to urge them to end their operations in Russia. He said he received no reply.
“Dozens of employees of American Chamber of Commerce member companies have been killed during the initial months of Russia’s brutal war in Ukraine. It is not only immoral but in many cases now also illegal to invest in Russia,” Mr. Hunder said in a written statement to The Globe. “We applaud the companies that have made the decision to leave Russia, and encourage companies to follow suit, to do the right thing, be on the right side of history.”
As Viterra wrestles with the operations in both Russia and Ukraine, it is working to acquire Nebraska-based Gavilon Agricultural Investment Inc. Viterra announced the US$1.13-billion ($1.443-billion) deal in late January, less than a month before the Russian President ordered the invasion of Ukraine.
The purchase of Gavilon is seen as significant for Viterra as it would give the company a major presence in the U.S. market, something it currently lacks. “Viterra is now present in all major agricultural origination regions of the world,” chief executive Gary Nagle said when the deal was announced. “This will enable the company to take advantage of structural opportunities across global agricultural markets.”
S&P Global Ratings, which analyzes Viterra’s publicly owned bonds, said the company’s betterthan-expected results in 2021 made its balance sheet healthier, but it was taking on debt to pay for Gavilon that gave it “reduced headroom” to maintain its debt ratings if things went wrong. S&P could “lower the rating if Viterra’s [profits] suffered from strong operational headwinds,” analyst Maxime Puget wrote in an April report.
He also said Viterra “has strong sourcing capabilities thanks to its global reach,” including the U.S., once it acquires Gavilon, and is “therefore not dependent on Ukraine and Russia.”
Viterra’s Mr. Cockwill said in response to The Globe’s questions that “any reduction to revenues from Russia and Ukraine will not impact the Gavilon acquisition.”
Mark Dixon, the founder of the Moral Rating Agency, a Londonbased group that evaluates companies based on their ethics, has called for both Viterra and Glencore – which also owns stakes in major Kremlin-controlled natural-resource companies – to immediately stop doing business in Russia.
“Viterra is acting commercially, not morally – it is supporting Russia financially by importing grain while it profits from postinvasion escalating prices. Viterra’s argument about ‘food security’ is just an excuse to make more money,” Mr. Dixon said.
“Its three shareholders – Glencore, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and British Columbia Investment Management Corp. – must speak out. Since none of them own more than 50 per cent of Viterra, each needs to disclose if it is for or against leaving Russia.
Otherwise, any shareholder saying it doesn’t control the company looks like it’s making a fake excuse.”
Glencore, which was founded by the late Marc Rich – a controversial financier who was indicted for illegally trading in oil with Iran during the 1979 hostage crisis, only to later get a presidential pardon from Bill Clinton – has a reputation for investing in companies and markets that other Western companies have avoided. Glencore announced in February that it was setting aside US$1.5-billion ($1.915-billion) to cover the potential costs of continuing bribery and corruption investigations connected to its work in Venezuela, Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of the Congo.
The company’s ties to Russia were once deep and were powered by personal connections. Mr. Putin awarded the Order of Friendship medal to Glencore’s former chief executive, Ivan Glasenberg, in 2016 after Glencore bucked sanctions to buy a 19.5per-cent stake in Rosneft, the Kremlin-owned oil giant, providing it with a desperately needed US$11-billion ($14.05-billion) injection of cash.
Though Glencore later reduced its stake in Rosneft to 0.57 per cent, it still holds 10.55 per cent of EN+, the parent company of aluminium producer Rusal. EN+ was founded by Oleg Deripaska, a Kremlin-friendly oligarch who is also on the Canadian, U.S. and EU sanctions lists.
Mr. Glasenberg retired as chief executive last July and was succeeded by his fellow South African, Mr. Nagle. Since the invasion, Glencore has condemned the attack on Ukraine and said in March that it was “reviewing all our business activities in [Russia] including our equity stakes in En+ and Rosneft.”

Full text: With August winding down, summer’s hourglass is decidedly half empty. Labour Day weekend will be here before we know it. Soon enough, the leaves will be turning, too. But hang on. There is still plenty of time for unhurried meals lingering on porches, patios or poolside and opportunity to open something cool and refreshing that compliments the laissez-faire atmosphere. (I love well-made rosé all year round, so I don’t see that window needing to close to usher in pumpkin spice season).
Local produce and homegrown vegetables, however, have me craving herbal-laced wines of late, which explains why this week’s column is so focused on sauvignon blanc. These are terrific to enjoy with ripe tomatoes, corn, cucumbers, peppers and zucchini. I am looking forward to serving one of these alongside juicy, grilled peaches or nectarines as part of a savoury salad before we bid farewell to summer.
Since wines made from sauvignon blanc and blends aren’t to everyone’s taste, I’ve also recommended a richer chardonnay and viognier that fit the bill, and I’ve also included two recently introduced ready to drink selections to consider.

Full text: TORONTO The world is becoming less colourful. And there are statistics to prove it.
Recently, the Cultural Tutor posted a number of tweets documenting the rise of greys, beiges, greiges, blacks and whites, and the alarming decrease of vibrant colours in product and interior design. A chart of car colours by year showed that, while today “greyscale” colours make up three-quarters of “cars produced globally, it was about 50 per cent” as recently as 1990. Two parking lot photographs backed this up: a candy-coloured one from the 1980s and a drab one from today.
Dulux paint’s most popular colours in 2020 were “Polished Pebble,” “Chic shadow” and “Goose down,” and another graph showed that neutral colours are “by far the most popular” in off-the-rack clothing. As a final shocker, the Cultural Tutor posted a graph showing the colour of “every day objects” from 1800 to 2020, and it appears that blacks, greys and whites are choking the rainbow out of existence.
Perhaps that’s why I waited 10 months for a wood-burning fireplace to arrive when it was only supposed to take four, and my kitchen renovation was delayed by a few months because it wasn’t easy getting pink cabinet paint.
It ain’t easy being green. Or turquoise. Or yellow. I get it. We live in a world where the dominance of car leasing means no manufacturer wants to end up with an unrentable fleet of purple Plymouths. Folks change houses so often they subconsciously decorate with home staging in mind. And grey and black clothing helps takes colour theory out of a busy morning.
But my wife, Shauntelle, and I have made it our motto that “Life is too short for beige” so much so that, when we renovated the kitchen of our downtown Toronto condo in 2011 and I profiled in these pages, we took it as a badge of honour when one Globe reader commented that it looked like “a bus terminal from the 1960s” owing to the vintage yellow and red tile backsplash and Formica countertops.
So, when we purchased our retail/residential building on the Danforth in 2018 and it had a failing, falling apart, all-white kitchen from the early 1990s, it didn’t seem strange to rip it out and replace it with a gently used 1962-3 Eaton’s Viking kitchen in turquoise with yellow laminate millwork. What was silly was that I’d found it while surfing Kijiji with “all of Ontario” activated rather than just the Greater Toronto Area, and this stunning specimen happened to be in a cabin near Thunder Bay, a 28-hour round trip (for a full account of this epic journey, Google “retro kitchen road trip”).
Not that that stopped me.
Unfortunately, because we had a store to build and open (Ethel – 20th Century Living), the Thunder Bay kitchen, with its tiny twin sinks (and no dishwasher) and woefully inadequate storage (one cabinet) was where I, the family cook, toiled for the next 31/2 years. Yes, we approached a few kitchen places, but few wanted to take on a project that involved building new stuff around old stuff, and fewer still seemed confident with plastic laminate.
One even ran screaming when we told him we had two marble panels from Canada’s tallest building, the 72-storey First Canadian Place, that we wanted to use as a partial countertop (in 2011, 45,000 marble panels were removed and replaced with glass panels in one of the largest façade retrofits ever done).
Thank goodness I bumped into Giovanni Cirinna at Gelato on the Danny & Espresso Bar across the street. Not only is Mr. Cirinna an experienced tiler and allaround nice guy, he’d just taken over Avonlea Kitchens + Bathroom Concepts two blocks away and was looking for clients.
While some of our choices may not have been his cup of, er, cappuccino, he kept his eye rolls to a minimum while we discussed the best ways to increase storage, add modern niceties such as a much larger and deeper sink, a touch-on/touch-off faucet, or a range hood, all while keeping the overall retro appearance (of a sixties bus depot).
Thanks to websites such as Pam Kuber’s Retro Renovation, I was made aware that Panolam Surface Systems had reintroduced Nevamar Brand’s Venus laminate, which was a perfect accompaniment to the Thunder Bay stuff, so an order was placed.
It was also around this time that another order was placed for a completely unrelated-to-thekitchen item.
In 1960, Malm Fireplaces, Inc., began producing freestanding “mod” fireplaces in Santa Rosa, Calif., and still crank them out today using the old metal-bending machines. So, a visit to their local representative, Toronto Home Comfort on Lawrence Avenue East, got the log rolling. There, we were made aware that iconic colours, such as red or orange, could only be obtained if we chose a gas unit, since those are powder coated. Wood-burning units, we were told, are finished in porcelain enamel, and those colours produce toxins that have been outlawed by the state. Good thing Shauntelle’s favourite colour is turquoise.
Mr. Cirinna and his guys stepped in and put up the fake fieldstone wall from local manufacturer Stonepark Inc. (in the 1960s this was called “flagcrete”) and the hearth’s starburst tiles in anticipation of a late February/ early March fireplace arrival.
It arrived from Malm at the end of July; while supply chain issues were part of the reason, the fact that we chose turquoise might also have been an issue, since the porcelain workers failed at their first attempt to fire the colour properly.
It seems even in the world of retro-styled fireplaces, colour is a thing of the past.

Condo builders crank up the incentives: One Toronto developer directly targeting rising rates, with offer to cover part of mortgage

Full text: THE LISTING F rom free Louis Vuitton bags to maintenance-fee holidays sales incentives for preconstruction condominiums are coming back, with some builders creatively targeting a key sticking point for some of today’s buyers: rising interest rates.
Major real estate developer Camrost Felcorp has rolled out a sales incentive on two of its Toronto-area projects that goes directly at the fears of rising interest rates by promising to cover 3 per cent of a condo mortgage’s interest payments for three years. For the 46-year old company, it’s an out-of-character sales promotion.
“We’re not an incentive-driven developer: This isn’t the Walmart or Canadian Tire model where nothing is ever really full price and everything is always on sale, that’s not how we approach our business,” said Christopher Castellano, vice-president of sales and marketing.
So far the mortgage rate reduction is planned for just two Camrost projects – the Residences of Upper East Village in Toronto’s Leaside neighbourhood and the fourth tower in its Exchange District (EXS) site in Mississauga – where time may be on the mind of buyers. Both buildings are expecting to be ready for occupancy within the next two years (a short turnaround for preconstruction buyers, who can typically expect to wait five to seven years). The Residences site has a collection of larger-units that were held back from initial sales in a building that will be registering early in 2023. While the EXS is more mixed with suites from 555square feet to just under 900 square feet, the luxury apartments will share a building and amenities with a boutique hotel that is under construction now.
Both buildings are targeting a larger share of so-called “end-users” who might expect to live in the apartments, unlike the typical condo investor intending to flip units or rent them out.
Mr. Castellano said that the recent run-up in Bank of Canada interest rates has buyers fretting about near-term affordability.
“Interest rates have knocked off about $500,000 from a purchaser’s affordability; that will drop you down two bands worth of pricing,” he said. “People just don’t know what’s going to happen with interest rates. … The stuff coming to market in the next 24 months has people sweating the most.”
On Aug. 2, real estate analysis firm Urbanation Inc. released a report that suggested some developers are taking a pass on even trying sell into this rate environment: It revised an earlier prediction on condominium presales that estimated 36,000 condo units would go up for sale in 2022 down to 26,000. That implies that 10,000 condo units that were being primed for sale have been pushed off into future years.
Not everyone in the industry accepts those figures represent a shift in market sentiment.
“We are not experiencing delays or pullback. … The headlines that are hitting surprised me. In fact we’re ahead and our pipeline for the fall is robust,” said Barbara Lawlor, CEO of Baker Real Estate Inc., a major player in preconstruction condo sales. “There’s lots of conversation … but it’s not stopping the big guns from going out. The atmosphere is skittish, it’s nervous, because of the headwinds of interest rates and the Rword – recession – having said that, we continue to sell.”
“There’s a lot of noise right now,” said Pauline Lierman, vicepresident of market research for real estate analysts Zonda Urban, who suggested any delays thus far are likely down to factors such as local planning delays rather than interest rate panic. That said, if there are going to be rate-related changes to sales plans she believes they are likely to start happening in the fall after the next scheduled rate-hike announcement.
For a large condo that requires a million dollar mortgage the Camrost incentive could be worth as much as $90,000, which will be paid in a lump sum to the buyer when they take possession (or knocked off the purchase price as a credit). Buyers are not required to use a particular mortgage lender (unlike some promotions the industry has tried in the past) but the deal is only “up to” 3 per cent: if a buyer secured a 2.5per-cent rate, Camrost will not be paying them an extra 50 basis points of value below zero.
There’s still some risk for Camrost according to Mr. Castellano: “If rates drop 30 days later, that’s a windfall for the purchaser, that’s a risk for us that we’re overpaying.” But the purpose of the deal is to provide “peace of mind” to buyers that if rates continue to rise there’s some affordability protection built into their purchase.
There are less generous incentives in the market now, such as an offering from the Southport at Swansea condo project in Toronto (from Barry Zagdanski’s State Building Group) that would discount closings costs (up to $30,000), and a project in Hamilton backed by Emblem Developments Inc. – run by CEO Kash Pashootan, who is also the CEO of First Avenue Investment Counsel Inc. – that gathered a lot of buzz by offering a free Louis Vuitton bag to buyers (estimated retail price, $3,500).
Ms. Lawlor said the most important incentives remain a reasonable price per square foot and a flexible deposit structure, the latter growing in popularity as the average price of deposits has soared into the multi-hundredthousand-dollar range.
Brokers who work with condo investors say that even Camrost’s 3-per-cent interest over three years isn’t going to change the affordability picture for buyers, but it could serve to nudge some into action.
“It’s just an add-on. Let’s say you’re going to get a car like a Toyota Camry: Would you instead buy a Hyundai ‘cause it has a sun roof? The fundamentals have to be the reason why you are purchasing. … The incentive is what encourages people that are almost at the finish line,” said Nerses Sraidarian, broker of record at Big City Realty Inc.
Some of his clients believe the rates will begin to fall back within a year, while he believes 18 months is more likely, and acknowledged the uncertainty may keep some buyers on the sidelines. But if rates continue to rise quarter after quarter he expects more builders to borrow the mortgage rate discount idea.
“In our industry there’s a lot of regurgitated information, one person does something and seven others will copy it,” Mr. Sraidarian said.

Full text: 2992 PE-1 HIGHWAY, SOUTH PINETTE, PEI There aren’t many opportunities to own a big chunk of Canada’s smallest province, but the farm at 2992 PE-1 Highway, South Pinette, is one of those chances. Located on the more touristy eastern side of the island on the southern coast, the farm is about 35 minutes from Charlottetown, and a short drive to the ferry to Nova Scotia in Montague. There is 175 acres of land separated by the highway and the southern plot gives the owner about 700 feet of beachy waterfront on Gascoigne Cove just off the Northumberland Strait (with an Airbnb-ready one-bedroom cottage sited on the water for visitors).
The owners bought the place in the 1970s and the 1916 red-brick Edwardian farmhouse has been maintained impeccably to retain its rural charm. Inside there’s dark red walls and floral wallpaper and honey-coloured wood floors everywhere you look. The three bedrooms on the upper floors are tucked under the dormers and the main floor has greenhouse-like sunroom built off the living room. The large kitchen – done all in wood including butcher block counters – connects to the dining room and a walkout to a rear porch. There are several out-buildings, including a horse barn and a granary that has been converted to a guesthouse with its own kitchen and second-floor bedroom (by contrast the seaside cottage has more of a kitchenette in one large open space). About 100 acres of the land has been contracted out to a neighbour who practises organic farming.
“This is the nicest farm home I think I’ve been in,” said listing agent Nick MacDonald with Re/ Max Charlottetown Realty who puts a price tag of $1.2-million on the property. “For PEI, this is in the upper end of the market, but there’s been a ton of interest. It’s one of those properties where people coming in the driveway have that ‘oh my god’ moment. … It tends to stick with them.”
53315 RANGE RD. 134, RURAL YELLOWHEAD COUNTY, ALTA.
Built in 1993, this cozy log home has dark walnut-stained floors and timber-clad main rooms with round log beams and wood-burning fireplaces. “The kitchen part of the house is actually a 100year-old cabin, and they custom built the rest of the log house around it,” said Laura Miller, of Century 21 Twin Realty, who is listing the property for sale. The open kitchen and dining room transitions from those log walls into a modern kitchen with big island, and fridge and stand-up freezer bookending a run of cabinets and counters in the corner of the room. There are two bedrooms on the upper floor and a covered balcony deck off the primary bedroom.
And for $1.2-million you get 287 acres of land, a barn for cattle, a shop, its own sawmill and a couple cabins and other out-buildings. The couple who owns it is also willing to negotiate over including the cattle operation in the sale, with equipment and animals that could add another $500,000. There’s also an oil lease on the property that generates about $3,200 a year.
It’s midway between Edmonton and the western provincial boundary of the Rockies (Jasper National Park is bout 150 kilometres away) along the TransCanada Highway and the closest big town is Edson about half an hour away. “They’ve been on that land forever, it’s never been up for sale,” said Ms. Miller. People from out of province like the peacefulness, and the low property taxes which were just $466 last year.
SOUTH MENEZES, HUDSON BAY, SASK.
The great exodus from Ontario to more affordable parts of the country touch everywhere, including the tiny town of Hudson Bay, Sask., population 1,700, which is A) not on any type of bay, B) about 330 kilometres from province’s biggest city Saskatoon and C) definitely nowhere near the actual Hudson’s Bay (Manitoba is in the way).
Realtor Ruby Moshenko has lived in Hudson Bay all her life, and for most of her career she sold homes to locals and if there was someone from out of province looking to buy they were coming for a local job or returning home to family. Not since the pandemic: She has sold homes to families looking to buy “sight unseen” – some who plan to work remotely (satellite internet will be a must for those folks) or get work locally. “They are young, 40s and 50s, they are selling and coming here and living debt-free,” she said.
And who could blame them when $395,000 can get you 35 acres of prairie and an updated open-plan farmhouse with panoramic views from every window.
The farmhouse Ms. Moshenko is listing in South Menezes, just off the Saskota Travel Route south of Hudson Bay, has a pond, stands of pine to shelter the home from the winds, and an updated farmhouse that was first built in 1952.
The kitchen anchors the huge open living room and dining room with a vaulted ceiling clad in blond wood, a black brick fireplace and sliding door walkout to the deck. The black cabinetry wraps around the outside wall under what feels like an acre of butcher-block counter, including an induction range, double fridge-freezer and a massive island. There are two bedrooms on the upper level, one tucked into a loft, and a primary suite on the main level with its own ensuite and closet. The land is leased for cultivation, but there are outbuildings and an ambitious selfstarter could build something for themselves. And the property taxes last year were just $2,400.
849 FAIRFAX RD., LANSDOWNE, ONT.
Farmhouses come in all kinds of materials and depending on the age and the area you could expect log, brick, simple timber frame or if you’re lucky sometimes you find stone.
The stone construction of the 1883 farmhouse found at 849 Fairfax Rd. in Lansdowne, Ont., adds some wow factor to the 125-acre hobby/horse farm. Listed for sale at $1.05-million by Laurie Dillon of Greater Ottawa Realty Inc., the farm is about 10 minutes from Ganonoque and an hour from Ottawa, but she expects a buyer from the Greater Toronto Area might be interested in a chunk of the St.
Lawrence Seaway. The house sits near the centre of the lot, surrounded by thickets of trees that then open up to the fields that are currently farmed for hay, at the back of the wooded area is the horse barn and sand track that’s a little more than a decade old. Last year the annual property taxes were just $2,599.
Inside, the “summer kitchen” (an add-on not built of stone) was renovated in 2008 with custombuilt Alder cabinets and soapstone counters and is an openconcept space with dining room and an island. The rest of the house has smaller rooms typical to pre-20th-century stone houses.
Many of the fixtures are antiques salvaged from other homes in the area; the mantle on the fireplace comes from a teardown in nearby town, some of the light fixtures were sourced in Kemptville, Ont.
There are three bedrooms on the second floor, and like many stone houses the ceilings do not exactly soar, but they are clad in painted ship-lap wood – a staple of modern farmhouse decor – and when paired with the lightly stained hardwood floors throughout the look shouts rustic comfort.
“You pull in the lane and you feel the stress come out of your neck,” Ms. Dillon said. “If I were not downsizing myself I’d be all over this.”
2321Z CHEMIN THOMAS-GORE, LACHUTE, QUE.
Just east of the town of Lachute, Que., (and about an hour away from Montreal to the east) the huge 430-acre lot of 2321Z Chemin Thomas-Gore extends in a dogleg shape from the main road through the undeveloped rivers and lakes of central Quebec. And as you might hope for a piece of rural Quebec, it’s set up to produce maple syrup.
“There’s a beautiful sugar shack, and everything’s automated” said Dany Lavallée of MultiImmo Laurentides Real Estate, who is listing the home for $1.95million.
There are more than 500 tapped maples on the land, in addition to a barn, a shop and other outbuildings, there are trails, creeks, a hunting camp and fields that grow soybeans and wheat.
The farm was established in 1860, and the house sits above a large pond that you can enjoy from the wraparound porch.
“It’s a rural type of home: metal roof, three-layered brick house, now re-done all inside, on that classic rock foundation,” Mr. Lavallée said.
The eat-in kitchen has creamcoloured cabinets and stone counters with tumbled stone backsplash.
The main rooms are light and bright with cream walls, plaster chandelier medallions and crown moulding throughout. There is a bedroom on the main floor and two more on the second, with an attic storage room that could be converted. Taxes were about $5,800 in 2021.

Full text: Interest rate analyst, mortgage strategist and editor of MortgageLogic.news Enter “Canadian home prices” into a Google search and you’ll find endless headlines about real estate imploding.
That, and 13-year highs in mortgage rates, have driven countless homebuyers to the sidelines. And many are now licking their chops, hoping to buy closer to the bottom.
To do that takes market timing. Most experts discourage timing for good reason. Gauging price direction can be a crapshoot.
Take the most widely used metric of prices in Canada, for example, the Canadian Real Estate Association’s average home price.
The country’s average price has skidded 18.4 per cent from February’s peak, and likely 20 per cent-plus once July numbers come out midmonth.
But averages are misleading.
More on that in a minute.
BUYING SOME TIME If you’re a prospective home buyer, you probably want to know when it’s safe to go back in the water.
I’ll give you some clues and a caveat. The caveat is, I’m not a fortune teller and don’t pretend to be a home price timer.
The clues that follow are legit, however, and their turning points will coincide with a bottom in most cases.
PRICES IN YOUR REGION As mentioned above, average home prices can’t be relied on, particularly at the national level.
If you see the average price plummet, you have to dig deeper. Are similar types of homes (four-bedroom two-storeys, for example) selling for less? Or are people simply buying more apartment condos, which drags down the average price?
The latter is a major factor right now as steep mortgage rates slash buying power. Economists call it the “composition effect.”
Average prices are also deceptively high because they’re constantly skewed by high-end sales.
A bunch of $3-million-plus home sales can prop up average prices. But when people stop buying $3-million-plus homes, average prices can dive.
Again, with mortgages harder to qualify for, we’re seeing this trend now.
Median prices are a far better gauge of true price action but they still suffer from compositional effects, albeit much less than average prices.
Problem is, it’s impossible to find median price data nationwide.
CREA doesn’t publish the data owing to restrictions from certain real estate boards. Hopefully this changes some day.
In the meantime, if you’re in Ontario or British Columbia, use a site like HouseSigma for median prices. It even projects median prices well before official data are released.
Since median data are unavailable in most regions, people have to rely on home price indexes (HPIs), which you can get from CREA, Teranet and RPS Real Property Solutions. HPIs compare similar types of homes, which makes price comparisons far more accurate.
CREA’s version is solid because it’s based on sales in the Multiple Listing Service (MLS), even if those sales haven’t closed yet. Hence, it’s as timely an HPI as you can get.
Tip: Check your local real estate board’s HPI because most publish local data one to two weeks before CREA.
HPIs such as CREA’s let you get granular, showing prices of the home type and location you’re shopping for – condos in Regina, for example.
For signs of a price bottom, you want the HPI in your region to at least start going sideways, potentially auguring a reversal upward.
SALES Home sales lead prices and sales have been plunging thanks to soaring rates and buyer uncertainty. In many cases, sellers are pulling listings because they’re not getting anywhere near their asking price.
What you want to see is home sales at least starting to flatten out. Check your local real estate board as it publishes this data monthly.
INVENTORIES When homes don’t sell, inventories pile up. As the number of homes for sale builds, people get more desperate and cut their prices. Some pull their home off the market altogether.
Fortunately in most regions, CREA suggests that people aren’t panic listing. But let’s see what happens in the fourth quarter or early next year. Ideally you want to see inventory growth slow meaningfully, or pull back.
Again, you can get this data from real estate boards and CREA.
UNEMPLOYMENT Most people don’t have to sell, so long as they have a job and can make their payments. Housing capitulation generally requires a surge in job losses and currently, Canada has a record low unemployment rate of 4.9 per cent.
Thing is, our strong job market won’t last forever. If bond market predictions are right, we’re less than 18 months away from recession. By the traditional two quarters of negative GDP measure, the United States is already in one.
To monitor unemployment, check Statistics Canada monthly.
It’ll take at least a half-percentage-point jump in unemployment to start driving job-related forced sales and much more than a half-point for a true crash.
Just remember, it can take months for rising unemployment to translate to home selling.
A TURN IN RATES If you’re a sideline buyer waiting for your big chance, you’ll want to see: A signal from the Bank of Canada that it’s done hiking rates – which could happen by next year if our uninvited guest, inflation, decelerates meaningfully.
A continued drop in Canada’s five-year bond yield The bond market pricing in rate cuts in the next 12 to 18 months By the time these three things happen, much of the selling driven by rising rates will have ended.
Final point: I speak with lots of liquid real estate investors and most are just waiting to snap up bargains, especially given soaring rents and immigration-fed population growth.
Every serious buyer who is on the sidelines right now is watching these very same clues. If you’re a prospective buyer, you should, too.
And if you misread these indicators and mistime your purchase, it’s okay so long as you have a long-term time horizon. It may take two, five or 10 years, but in the long-run, real estate values always grow.
RATES THIS WEEK Despite five-year bond yields tumbling 80 basis points from the June peak, banks are still holding out on lowering their uninsured five-year fixed rates.
Bankers I talk to attribute this to perceived credit risk in the funding markets, illiquidity and volatility (which affect funding and hedging costs) and static competition (banks don’t have to move if other banks aren’t moving).
Meanwhile, the country’s lowest insured five-year fixed rates are down 40 basis points from their 4.84 per cent peak in July.

Full text: Daniele Zanotti is president and CEO of United Way Greater Toronto.
Darryl White is CEO of BMO Financial Group and United Way Community Campaign 2022 chair.
We have reached an inflection point for economic and social progress. With the Canadian Consumer Price Index reaching a new multidecade high of 8.1 per cent in June, affecting the cost of basics such as groceries, gas and housing, an affordability crisis now directly threatens communities across the Greater Toronto Area, particularly those disproportionately affected by the pandemic.
Over the past two years, distress centres serving the Greater Toronto Area had a 400-per-cent increase in calls, with 50 per cent coming from first-time callers.
Food Banks Canada tracked 1.3 million visits – its highest on record – with more than 33 per cent of recipients being children. Community social agencies delivering front-line services are being squeezed on both ends. Demand for their services is rapidly increasing, their cost of gas, supplies and food is affected by the very same inflationary forces as other consumers, while the public and private revenues needed to run their organizations are not keeping pace.
More than 300 community agencies supported by United Way Greater Toronto provide support to more than two million members of our community struggling to recover from the dual threat of the pandemic effects and today’s affordability crisis. If ever there were a time to address the gaps that continue to grow wider in our social safety net, it is now.
Long-term systemic change requires a fundamental shift in how we approach solutions. It requires leaders across private, public and community sectors to come together and collaborate. The key is in an inclusive approach because everyone – regardless of who they are or where they live – has a role to play.
It starts with listening and involving those experiencing these issues first-hand to ensure we get it right. And it must start at the neighbourhood level in the postal codes where poverty is most concentrated, exposing the factors that keep people living in poverty.
How do we know this will work? We’re seeing progress with a series of pilot projects we’re undertaking in the Greater Golden Mile community of Scarborough through the Inclusive Local Economic Opportunity (ILEO) initiative. Led by BMO Financial Group and United Way Greater Toronto, ILEO is a partnership of 32 senior leaders representing a cross-section of the private, public and community sectors.
This initiative recognizes a need and a responsibility to ensure all members of a community benefit when large-scale infrastructure investments are made in their neighbourhood. With income and employment rates far below the Toronto average, the pace of economic growth within Greater Golden Mile neighbourhoods is not keeping up. In the coming decades, with real estate development momentum spurred by large-scale rapid transit projects, more than 75 new mid- and high-rise buildings, including 32,000 residential units and more than a million square feet of office and retail space will be built there, offering an opportunity to develop a community accessible for residents of all income levels.
By bringing community agencies, corporate and government partners to the table to explore innovative approaches to address disparity, together we’re mapping out ways to create local economic opportunities and drive social change from the ground up, with residents at the centre.
The initiative prioritizes hiring residents in this community with a special focus on members of underrepresented groups – including women, newcomers and racialized communities – and offers skills training, competitive pay and opportunities for advancement. It focuses on a range of pilot projects, including a communityowned construction joint venture, a storefront starter and local procurement of products and services to support established and emerging local businesses. It also serves as a forum for new partners to tackle old problems together, such as local retailers working with community agencies to disrupt systemic barriers to economic participation for residents.
ILEO has the potential to be replicated in other communities, offering just one example of a new approach and a deeper working relationship across public, private and charitable sectors. This approach has the power to effect social change at the neighbourhood level for a more equitable future and to help counter the effects of affordability and pandemic challenges.
These opportunities are not just game changing, they’re life changing. When the private, public and community sectors come together, the results can be transformational, and the progress we achieve can make our communities more resilient to the greatest challenges facing us all.

Full text: The man who has led B.C.’s housing agency for 22 years is resigning, saying several recent incidents of violence against homeless people, plus the increasingly threatening environment for policy makers have left him questioning whether he can continue to offer solutions.
In a lengthy resignation statement, Shayne Ramsay said the work of providing housing for those who need it most is being threatened, because “small but vocal groups of people are increasingly angry and increasingly volatile.”
The career bureaucrat appointed to the role of BC Housing chief executive in 2000 under the then-NDP government, said he had become discouraged after seeing multiple incidents where homeless people were attacked or they were vilified by people who didn’t want them living nearby.
“While one community faces the almost certain prospect of poverty, poor health, violence, and premature death, others are now unwilling to provide a welcoming space, a space that could save lives,” said Mr. Ramsay, who has lived in the Downtown Eastside himself for 12 years. He also said he was upset about a recent incident in which police shot a man at an encampment for homeless people in Vancouver.
“I no longer have confidence I can solve the complex problems facing us at BC Housing.”
His resignation, which takes effect Sept.
6, came barely more than a month after a provincial government review outlined several problems at the agency, including a lack of criteria or documentation for why some non-profits in some programs were getting contracts.
Mr. Ramsay was confronted last week by a group of angry Kitsilano residents over his presentation to city council about a social-housing project in that area. They were angry at him for denouncing NIMBYs and misinformation as he pleaded with council to approve the project. (It was eventually approved, with conditions, in an 8-3 vote.)
In his statement, Mr. Ramsay referred to the confrontation as one of the recent disturbing events that tipped the scale for him.
“Security at the City have since advised that after reviewing the video footage, they believe the swarming and threatened punch amounted to assault,” he wrote.
“This time it was angry words and a fist, next time it could be worse.”
Mr. Ramsay said in his statement he’s been watching with growing alarm at violence perpetrated against homeless people.
He said “something shifted” for him in May as he watched police converge on a Downtown Eastside park where a man lay fatally stabbed, an incident that occurred just minutes after Mr. Ramsay had left the area while walking his dog.
Over the past week, he noted, people who were homeless and formerly homeless died during a six-hour string of killings in suburban Langley, B.C. In another incident, a woman was intentionally lit on fire just a block from where Mr. Ramsay lives.
“These incidents are not isolated, nor are they the only incidents that have caused me to lay awake at night,” Mr. Ramsay wrote.
Still, his resignation was a surprise to some and prompted an outpouring of praise for his work from former Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp. CEO Evan Siddall, many from B.C.’s non-profit housing sector, the occasional BC Housing resident, and current and former politicians.
“His impact cannot be overstated and I want to thank him for his tireless advocacy,” said Vancouver Mayor Kennedy Stewart, who said that thousands of people in B.C. had been provided with safe homes because of Mr. Ramsay.
Mr. Ramsay’s imminent departure also prompted worries about where the agency will go now.
“Shayne grew into being the most accomplished housing CEO in the country,” said Thom Armstrong, the CEO of the Co-operative Housing Federation of B.C.
for almost the same period as Mr. Ramsay. “He’s done more in the way of housing outcomes than anyone else. I always thought of him as a housing activist in bureaucratic clothes. This is really a significant day – this is going to change the fact of how housing gets built in B.C.”
Mr. Armstrong said his concern now is that the province will put someone in charge of the agency who is only concerned about budget efficiency.
“And if the place is going to be run by accountants, they have no chance of achieving their outcomes.”
Others welcomed the news, saying Mr. Ramsay and his agency had run roughshod over neighbours expressing legitimate concerns about social housing being built near them.
BC Housing has been subject to public scrutiny lately, as the NDP government set out on an aggressive mission of building massive amounts of new affordable housing and tackling visible homelessness in many communities.
That has led to tussles between the province and local residents in many communities, from Grand Forks, Penticton and Maple Ridge to, recently, the upscale neighbourhood of Kitsilano in Vancouver.
As well, some NDP politicians and government bureaucrats got concerned about how BC Housing was managing a huge expansion in its mandate and budget, which ballooned from $785-million in 2017-18 to $2.247-billion for 2022-23.
A provincial review by the accounting firm Ernst & Young identified a number of problems in the agency, some as unremarkable as having inadequate information-technology systems, some more serious, involving contracts that were signed with various non-profit housing groups where there was no documentation about how and why decisions were made.
Shortly after that review was made public, then-housing minister David Eby announced he was replacing the entire board at BC Housing. The replacements were largely former deputy ministers and bureaucrats with financial expertise, as compared with the previous board appointed by the NDP’s Selina Robinson, who had more of a background in housing advocacy.
The agency has seen a lot of resignations of senior managers in the past couple of years, some frustrated by increasing controls on their work by the Treasury Board, which was making it hard to get real estate purchases done.
Others were frustrated by internal tensions.
Mr. Armstrong acknowledged that Mr. Ramsay had “really driven an equity and inclusion agenda” and that had made some people in the agency uncomfortable.
After the NDP formed government in 2017, BC Housing was given the mandate to build 29,000 of the 114,000 “affordable” homes in the next decade that had been promised in the campaign.
In recent years, Mr. Ramsay’s team has handed out contracts for hundreds of millions of dollars.
BC Housing also went on an aggressive campaign during the pandemic to buy hotels and motels to house homeless people – something that set off sharp backlashes in some communities.

Investor demand, lack of land prompt Vancouver to restrict self-storage development: Former fringe asset a ‘hot commodity’ in major centres, industry expert says

Full text: Only seven years ago, when Patrick Wood started specializing in B.C.’s self-storage real estate market, “no major bank would touch self-storage,” he says.
Back then, self-storage was still considered a mere “land cover” before the “real development” occurred, “so buyers had to resort to secondary lenders” to get loans, says Mr. Wood.
“But now, all the major banks like self-storage,” says Mr. Wood, a broker with Vancouver-based William Wright Commercial Real Estate Services.
After proving “recession resistant” during 2008, when some Canadians forced to downsize put their belongings in storage, the asset has delivered strong performances during COVID-19, as people have cleared out space for home offices, classrooms or gyms, Mr. Wood says.
Inflation has also proved no foil for the sector. Unlike residential rent, self-storage rental rates are unregulated, so owners can raise rates to keep pace with demand from residents pushed into smaller homes by soaring borrowing costs.
“Rental rents are at record highs,” Mr. Wood says.
In Vancouver, a unit inside the four-storey NationWide Self Storage is priced at $3.30 a square foot.
That’s higher than a typical apartment in the same East Vancouver neighbourhood: A 700square-foot apartment priced at that square footage would cost $2,310 a month.
As CBRE’s Clive Bradley puts it, self-storage has become “a hot commodity” during the past three years.
Mr. Bradley, head of CBRE’s self-storage practice group for Canada, says he is seeing “growing interest” from both individual investors and large public and private real estate investment trusts in Canada.
Capital demand has led to such an all-time surge of new facilities in Metro Vancouver – where six multistorey bunkers have opened in the past 18 months and eight are in development – that a ban has been imposed on new buildings in the city.
In April, Vancouver’s city council voted to prohibit selfstorage development near public transit. In addition, on the rare remaining urban land, any new project must incorporate “mixeduse” on the ground floor to create space and opportunity for other types of business.
A City of Vancouver report, Regulating Self-Storage Uses in Industrial Districts, states that developers from other industries were no longer able to compete against self-storage businesses financially for land and that the new measures aim to accommodate more labour-intensive ventures.
“I understand the decision,” Mr. Wood says. Hemmed in by ocean and mountains, “Vancouver has a very real lack of land for buildings where people can work, and the city thinks self-storage only employs a few people.”
However, especially given the rise in e-commerce, “they don’t see all the locals running businesses out of them,” using units to store product before shipping.
“Self-storage allows small business owners to stay in Vancouver, when they otherwise couldn’t afford to, or there’s no space for them.”
In a city with “astronomical retail rents” and “incredibly low” warehouse vacancy (currently at just 0.4 per cent, according to Colliers), Mr. Wood says even major retailers are storing inventory in self-storage or using it as last-mile distribution centres.
“I don’t think you could find a 400-square-foot industrial warehouse unit in downtown Vancouver to rent, but you can find a 400-square-foot storage unit to rent,” he says.
Now, at least one-third to “in some cases, half” of all B.C. selfstorage units are rented by commercial clients – a 50-per-cent increase from three years ago, he says.
According to North American self-storage researcher Radius Plus, Vancouver’s self-storage penetration rate – or the amount of square feet of storage per capita – is still about 2.4, less than half the U.S. rate of six.
So even given Vancouver’s staggering new supply rate, CBRE’s Mr. Bradley maintains that “generally speaking, the market is undersupplied.”
Shane Doyle, chief executive officer of NationWide Self Storage, says, “the word we rely on to explain our success in Vancouver is ‘luck.’ ” Since 2020, the company has opened two 60,000-square-foot facilities, with three more Metro Vancouver projects under construction.
“We’ve been lucky to find land on which we could actually build self-storage. But I don’t think that luck is going to continue. Land is very, very difficult to find. And the city doesn’t want to create permitting for self-storage any more,” he points out.
“We’re getting better rent than an apartment,” he says, “but our cost of operation is as minimal as you can get. So, we’re able to generate a lot better profitability.”
The company is currently raising financing for a sixth self-storage facility. Even if it was somehow lucky enough to score another sliver of permissible land in Vancouver, Mr. Doyle says the city’s new mixed-use rule would make the project prohibitively expensive.
“There are many examples in Vancouver where an acre of land zoned for multiuse will cost $30million,” and significantly higher depending on where it is. “Total construction costs – you’re now looking at $240 a square foot.”
NationWide’s East Vancouver location cost $22.5-million: $10million for land and $12.5-million for construction. A similar facility today “would cost $50-million minimum, to develop,” Mr. Doyle says.
Large cities are more profitable locations for self-storage, says Mr. Doyle. He has scouted B.C.’s second-largest city, Victoria, for three years, to no avail.
The lack of available land in that ocean-surrounded city has pushed commercial land prices as high as Vancouver’s and vacancy rates are even lower at just 0.1 per cent, according Colliers.
However, a young entrepreneur who “stumbled into the business” four years ago, recently managed to purchase two facilities close to Victoria.
Jay Barré worked for a large developer when he was assigned to market-research self-storage. “I realized it was a great, low-maintenance business with great cash flow,” Mr. Barré says.
He and his partner bought a facility on tiny Salt Spring Island, near Vancouver Island, and then purchased facilities in Nanaimo, Duncan and Courtenay, on Vancouver Island.
“For us, getting into the business in those places was just less expensive,” Mr. Barré explains.
But with growing equity, in March, they purchased a two-site portfolio, with both facilities 30 minutes from Victoria’s downtown.
The $36.2-million deal offers approximately 77,500 square feet of storage units on a combined 4.5 hectares.
Since launching their company, Pacific Rim Storage, their rents have risen 20 per cent and vacancy is less than 5 per cent.
“We love the business,” Mr. Barré says. “We’re hoping to keep growing.”

Full text: ARCHITECTURE A shimmering slab of brick and glass rises up from the corner of Brant and Camden Streets. Thirteen storeys tall, the structure is easy to overlook – until you notice the long ribbon of steel and Douglas fir that winds across the main façade and fans out like a carpet above the entrance.
The other day I walked under that ribbon, pushed through the oak revolving doors, and entered the Ace Hotel Toronto. I stepped across the floors of end-grain Douglas fir, ran my fingers across the porcelain bar top, and sat down with a friend beneath a ceiling finished in Venetian plaster.
The morning sun streamed through oak-framed windows in front of me. I ordered a coffee.
For an Ace Hotel, this was a normal scene. The 123-room property, which opened its doors on July 26, is the stylish U.S. hospitality chain’s first location in Canada. But it’s also a building by Shim-Sutcliffe Architects, which makes it architecture of the first importance – and not typically the kind of place where you can walk in and grab an Americano.
As much as architecture is an art form, Shim-Sutcliffe are artists. Led by the husband-and-wife team of Brigitte Shim and Howard Sutcliffe – her petite and garrulous, him gangly and quiet – they’ve spent 25 years creating some of the most refined architecture in the country. Or anywhere. The historian Kenneth Frampton recently called them “among the top 20 architects practising in the world today.”
When the national Governor General’s Medals in Architecture are announced, they inevitably win one.
But they almost never build for clients who have a bottom line. So for the design-conscious Ace Hotel, they’re both an obvious choice and a total wild card.
When this project began a halfdecade ago, I wondered how the architects’ sensibility would mesh with the budget requirements of a hotelier and developers; the project is a partnership between Ace and local real estate companies Zinc Developments and Alterra.
Through a seven-year process, slowed by the pandemic, they found a way to make it work. The results are extraordinary: The building is of its place and time, and yet it reflects a unique sensibility and a rare degree of craft.
On a recent tour of the building, Ms. Shim pointed to the chunky brick-clad pillars on the front façades. “The building is an urban manifesto,” she explained.
“It’s saying we believe in the built fabric of Toronto. In this neighbourhood, we’ve seen so many great brick warehouses demolished. We don’t want to imitate that, exactly, but we want to speak to it.” Brick is “the defining material of Toronto,” Mr. Sutcliffe added.
So the architects wanted a building with heft. That required making the front façades unusually thick. In general, Ms. Shim points out, a developer wants the skin of a building to be as thin as possible, so that the interior floor space – which generates revenue – can be as large as possible. But on the Ace, it was never discussed, she says. (“It’s possible they didn’t notice,” Mr. Sutcliffe counters with a short laugh.)
In the end, the hotel’s façades are a remarkable four feet deep.
In the lobby this makes the building feel – as intended – like a relic of a past era.
The same holds true in the guest rooms. Here, an assemblage of Douglas fir plywood frames the windows and the desk, somewhere between architecture and furniture. Listening to a song from Joni Mitchell’s Hejira on the turntable, a visitor could feel they’ve captured a certain image of Canada, sophisticated and just a bit rustic.
Downstairs in the lobby, an art installation by Mr. Sutcliffe, Horizon Line, renders the afternoon sunlight on Lake Ontario with triangles of plywood. It’s a quiet sign of the architects’ affinity with their home city.
“We are Canadians, and we work to capture a sense of place,” Ms. Shim said. “In this case that means speaking to the neighbourhood, the form and the materials of that place.” The biggest architectural move, however, is a pure exercise in space and structure. As you move through the front doors, you see the lobby lounge stretch out in front of you; this rests on a concrete tray, which hangs from the ceiling by impossibly thin steel rods. Concrete arches reach up from the left, swoop across the ceiling and then descend, past a long downward staircase, to anchor themselves in the earth.
Stairs descend and ascend on each side, themselves rich little fantasias in structural steel and ceramics.
Those concrete members are Shim-Sutcliffe to a tee. They follow a classic precept of modern architecture by exposing the bones of a building, but they are also deeply fussy. They bear the marks of the lumber used to form them, adding a human touch to a hard surface. And they connect to the rest of the building with oversized knuckles of steel that evoke, depending on your reference point, the Venetian architect Carlo Scarpa or steampunk.
That slightly mannered yet hospitable vibe puts Shim-Sutcliffe on the same wavelength as Ace, which usually works with existing buildings and vintage furniture.
“We aim to have it feel a bit like your cool friend’s apartment,” said Little Wing Lee, design director with the in-house agency Atelier Ace. “You can’t tell whether this particular element is from 1963 or from 1971. It’s timeless.”
In this case the lobby features a new table by Toronto designer Shaun Moore and a fiberglass lampshade by the classic local brand Lotte.
Since the Toronto Ace is a new build, the architects and designers had to create a sense of soul from scratch. Working with a budget and a constrained downtown site – just 24 metres on each side – they managed to pull this off.
“In five years,” hotel manager Lyle Pauls told me, “you won’t be able to tell whether it’s five years old or 55. Which is perfect for us.”
Ms. Shim reports that the relationship with Ace was “simpatico.” But she also points out that her firm was involved in every aspect of the design. This is unusual. Boutique design firms such as Shim-Sutcliffe generally hand off their work to colleagues, the “architects of record,” who resolve the endless issues that come with construction.
Not here. Shim-Sutcliffe generated thousands of drawings and saw them though. “Usually when you hire an architecture firm, you’re not getting access to the principals,” says Rob Cooper of Alterra, one of hotel’s co-owners.
“Here, when we needed to solve something, Howard would show up in an hour with a notebook.”
That commitment allowed Shim-Sutcliffe to innovate within commercial constraints. For instance, with the brick skin of the building. “We wanted to use hand-laid brick, of course,” Mr. Sutcliffe said. But this proved too expensive; instead the façades are panels of precast concrete with a thin face layer of brick. This is a common technique that usually looks like a poor imitation of a brick wall.
Mr. Sutcliffe chose to accentuate the piecemeal nature of the panels, leaving gaps, or “reveals,” between them, and sculpting the face pattern into syncopations and curves. It doesn’t exactly look like a brick wall – but it looks fantastic.
The hotel provides a rare chance for Shim-Sutcliffe to show off this kind of flair. The couple have long been picky about their clients. Across the globe, their buildings – predominantly private houses, though there’s also a home for an order of nuns – appear in architectural journals and glossy magazines. But good luck getting an invitation to see one.
“That’s an issue,” Mr. Sutcliffe acknowledged. “And now we’re really happy that people can just walk in here, have a coffee or have a beer. It’s pretty good. Hopefully people will enjoy it.”
They will. The Ace is an upscale hotel, and it won’t change the world. But it is a place that is distinctive and beautiful, and it will alter the culture of the place in which it sits. With luck, other dreamers, designers – and developers – will come for a drink and leave with their own plans for the city.

Full text: TALES FROM THE GOLDEN AGE It’s not an easy time to be a retiree. Many of them spent years saving for travel and social plans, only to have the COVID-19 pandemic erase both. Now surging inflation and the market meltdown are eroding retirees’ portfolios and spending power.
But it’s not all bad news. Many seniors are making the most of their freedom from work and taking advantage of the long summer days to travel again and pursue passions they never had time for in their working years.
Globe Investor spoke to five retirees across Canada about how they’re spending the summer and making most of their golden years – economic threats be damned.
Judy Wilson, 63, Edmonton Judy Wilson wasn’t planning to retire for another two years, but when people close to her became ill and there was a changing of the guard at work, she decided to call it quits.
“I realized I don’t have to wait until 65; I can go at 63,” says the former government worker who retired three months ago. “Terror was the first emotion, but then it got super exciting,” The first two months of retirement were “exhausting,” she says, because she didn’t know how to handle all the free time.
“I would get up and think, ‘Everything that I used to have to do on the weekends or in the evenings, I can do now.’ And I would get started and go until it was dark,” she says. “Then I realized, ‘I’m supposed to have more free time than this.’ ” She’s now pacing herself through various activities, including gardening, refinishing furniture, taking on the presidency of her Rotary Club, hiking daily with her three rescue dogs and spending more time with her 23-yearold daughter, who is living with her while attending university.
Rising inflation has been a concern, causing Ms. Wilson to cut back a bit on groceries and driving, but she says it hasn’t changed her lifestyle much. “I’m vegetarian, so I can just eat more beans and rice.”
Her utility bills have also risen recently, forcing her to revisit her budget, but she still doesn’t regret retiring early. “Not at all. I am not working to pay the utility company. I’d get rid of my lights and shower in cold water before I’d go back to work.”
And while gardening has kept her very busy so far in her retirement, Ms. Wilson isn’t concerned she won’t have enough to keep her busy during the winter. Instead, she plans to read more, remain an active Rotarian, take Spanish lessons and go on winter hikes with the dogs.
“I am giddy with the excitement of retirement and busier than I have ever been,” she says.
“It’s worth working full-time your whole life to experience this stage of life: It’s like winning the lottery.”
David Wende, 67, Parksville, B.C.
David Wende knew by age 35 that he wanted to retire at age 60 – and had a pretty good idea of the best way to go about it. He watched his father retire “cold turkey” and become miserable for a year until figuring out how best to spend the free time.
Mr. Wende semi-retired in 2014 and fully retired in 2018 – a purposeful, staggered exit from his career as a litigation lawyer in Vancouver while he and his wife planned how and where they would spend their golden years.
“Living in North Vancouver for 30-plus years, I knew I had to get out of the rainforest,” says the married father of two thirtysomething children. He also wanted to find a way to pursue his longtime passion for building things with wood.
The couple decided to buy a small “fixer-upper” log cabin on Shuswap Lake in the B.C. Interior in 2012 – a property he could slowly rebuild and expand, spend time in with his family and eventually leave to his kids.
In 2016, the couple sold their house in North Vancouver and used the proceeds to build a home on a piece of land Mr. Wende inherited from his father in Parksville, B.C. on Vancouver Island, as well as to recover their retirement savings used to purchase the cabin.
Rising inflation has made Mr. Wende think twice about the types of wood he uses – building cabinetry out of wood veneer instead of natural maple – but he isn’t too worried about rising prices cramping his retirement lifestyle. “If everything is paid for, you can live a pretty modest life,” he says. The couple also live on a budget and take advantage of income splitting and other tax-efficient strategies.
As for his stock market portfolio, which accounts for about half of his wealth, Mr. Wende has been through a few market downturns over the years and benefited from having a balanced portfolio and staying invested long-term.
Mr. Wende is more focused on enjoying his retirement, including his building projects, playing golf and travelling again now that pandemic lockdowns have been lifted. He and his wife recently returned from a three-week trip in France with friends and plan to spend much of the rest of summer at their cabin with family and friends.
Carole Lulham, 66, Saint John, N.B.
Carole Lulham was born and raised in Quebec, worked and raised her kids in Alberta, and has chosen to retire in New Brunswick, where she has reinvented herself as a mixed-media artist specializing in mosaic art.
And while it may sound like a part of a master plan for her golden years, Ms. Lulham’s retirement journey is more a combination of unforeseen circumstances, including a job loss and cancer diagnosis.
After a nearly 40-year career in the agriculture industry, Ms. Lulham was laid off from her last job at age 60 as a recession hit Calgary in 2016.
“I was thinking about retirement anyway, so it wasn’t a bad way to exit,” with a good severance package, she says. Coincidentally, Ms. Lulham sold her house the night before being laid off, so she was already preparing for some big lifestyle changes.
Unfortunately, months later, she was diagnosed with breast cancer. “That kind of cramped my style for a bit,” says Ms. Lulham, who spent two years getting treatment while renting a condo in Calgary.
Surviving cancer and being retired gave Ms. Lulham a new perspective on life and the freedom to do and go wherever she wanted. In 2018, she decided to move to Saint John, N.B., to be close to her two adult kids and one grandchild and start a new chapter.
“I made a conscious decision when I moved to New Brunswick to finally allow myself to aspire to call myself an artist.”
She says the province, in particular the Bay of Fundy, is replete with rock and minerals used in her work, which is shown at local galleries and occasionally sold. “It still stuns me when someone buys my work,” Ms. Lulham says.
Surviving cancer has also led her to worry less about money, slow down and appreciate life more.
“Since I had that brush with death, I don’t have the same concept of time, so when people say, ‘Yeah, it’s the long weekend,’ I think, ‘Every weekend is the long weekend.’ I love that.” Ann Bigelow, 63, London, Ont.
Ann Bigelow is spending the summer trying out retirement – for the third time.
Her first attempt was in 2019, after being offered an appealing early retirement package from her teaching job at Western University. Ms. Bigelow, a chartered professional accountant, saw it as an opportunity to test out retirement and teach a few courses on the side. Then the pandemic hit, and her courses moved online, which she didn’t enjoy. “I was very unhappy, so I stopped teaching,” she says.
It didn’t take long for Ms. Bigelow to realize she wasn’t ready to stop working, so she took a parttime gig with a public accounting firm. She quit in April, after a year, determined to try retirement again.
After three months off work, Ms. Bigelow hasn’t found fulfilling ways to fill chunks of her time.
“I need more contact with other people than I’m getting,” she says. And while her partner has been retired for about a decade, “I can’t rely on her to fill all of my time.”
The rising cost of living and sinking stock markets are adding to her concerns about not working, even though Ms. Bigelow says she lives fairly frugally and has a good retirement portfolio.
“I’m a worrier when it comes to money,” she says, “and so the inflationary environment and turbulent markets are keeping me awake.”
In particular, she struggles with being in the decumulation stage of life, including the tax hit, after decades of saving and investing.
“You get a lot of rewards for saving: With RRSPs and TFSAs, you reduce your tax liability,” she says.
“I just can’t get a grip on spending like I could with saving.”
To conserve some of her cash flow, Ms. Bigelow has recently cut back on a few perks such as weekly personal training sessions, online grocery delivery and meal-kit services.
But she’s also enjoying life and splurging a bit, including on a recent road trip to Halifax to visit one of her two adult sons.
Ms. Bigelow also gets some satisfaction from thinking about what job she might do next if she quits retirement again.
“I could go back to accounting, but maybe I’m done with that,” she says. Being a school bus driver was ruled out, but Ms. Bigelow’s latest idea is maybe becoming a real estate agent. “And then I wouldn’t be as panicked about taking money out because I’d have a regular income source that I could draw on.”
Peter Hambly, 74, Hanover, Ont.
Two weeks after he retired at age 65 from a 40-plus year career in banking, Peter Hambly got a call from his old boss asking if he wanted to come back part-time for a few months. It was a gift, in hindsight, since Mr. Hambly realized he wasn’t quite ready to stop working.
“I was financially ready for retirement, but not psychologically,” he says.
Mr. Hambly also served five terms on the town council in his community of Hanover, Ont., about 200 kilometres northwest of Toronto, until 2018.
“That was something that really helped me transition to retirement, too,” Mr. Hambly says. He was active in the local chamber of commerce for many years as well.
His main hobby is playing tournament bridge, something he started at university in the 1960s.
And while the pandemic paused his out-of-town bridge tournaments for more than two years, Mr. Hambly believes COVID-19 restrictions have been much harder on other people, such as parents homeschooling kids. “It’s easy for me to be cautious; I’m retired,” he says.
He’s slowly returning to in-person bridge games this year and is looking forward to travelling to tournaments again in the weeks ahead, despite the rising cost of getting there.
Mr. Hambly says higher inflation and the recent market turbulence don’t keep him up at night, partly because he and his wife saved a lot of money staying home the past couple of years.
For him, the challenge with retirement is keeping busy.
“Some days are long,” he says.
Once he has breakfast and reads the newspaper, it’s midmorning, “and there can be literally nothing on your schedule. You can only clean the house so many times.”
Mr. Hambly believes many people should continue working in their 50s and 60s – or longer – if they can, especially given the current labour shortage.
“Work as long as you can,” he says. “You get to stay connected to people; you get a bit more money – and the country needs you.” As told to Brenda Bouw These interviews have been edited and condensed.

Three ways to fight inflation within your personal life and portfolio

Full text: CONTRA GUYS Writer for the Contra the Heard Investment Letter How do you beat inflation?
This is perhaps the personal finance question of 2022. No matter where you turn, prices seem to be rising, and the sticker shock shows no signs of stopping. Though inflation can be frightening, there are ways to fight back within your personal life and your portfolio.
The best action you can take is to aim to stay employed, or to stay in business if you own a company.
This is because wages and business profits generally rise over time, while most unemployment benefits or pension payouts do not. As a result, retirees and the long-term unemployed often struggle more during inflationary periods.
If you are working, you may also want to consider three related strategies to improve your prospects.
First, ask your employer for an annual cost-of-living adjustment (COLA), which tracks with inflation. An annual COLA will help you maintain your standard of living, even if you do not get a raise.
Second, consider looking for new and higher paying jobs. You have little to lose by applying for jobs in a tight labour market like we are seeing now. Third, strive to add value at work and help your organization excel, or increase your skill set through formal education and training. Doing either (or both) of these activities will grow your employability and income-earning potential.
The second personal action you can take is to reduce expenses. If you can cut discretionary costs, you will be able to save more or divert funds into items you cannot avoid (food, rent/ mortgage payments, car loans, critical medical expenses, taxes etc.). The internet is full of tips and tricks to cut costs, and friends or family may have local insights too.
Then, of course, there is debt.
Cutting your debt could be critical, especially if you owe a lot. The higher inflation goes, the higher interest charges on borrowed funds tend to go as well. Every time the Bank of Canada raises rates, commercial lenders raise rates too. Therefore, it makes sense to pay down your debt as fast as you can and avoid new loans. If you have many debts, it typically makes most sense to pay off your highest interest rate obligations first, and then pay off your lowest interest rate debt later.
Finally, investing wisely is very important. Though investing is tough even at the best of times, inflation’s impact on different asset classes is well known and instructive. Inflation tends to hit cash and bonds hard. By contrast, commodities and commodity-related companies tend to do wonderfully, while stocks and real estate can do well or poorly, depending on how much debt they are carrying and what sector of the market they are in.
This year the stock market has taken a beating as inflation and interest rate increases have driven valuations and expected returns lower.
During the downturn, I have taken the opportunity to add new names to my portfolio and pad existing positions. Three of the companies getting a top-up include Orange SA, Banco Santander SA, and Yamana Gold Inc., all stocks that the Contra Guys have written about in the past.
In each case, I think they will do well in an inflationary environment. The telecom giant Orange SA, for example, should beat inflation because its services are not discretionary: people need their phones, data plans and internet access.
Banks tend to hold their own during inflationary periods too as they can maintain or expand their net interest margins.
This should help Banco Santander which has operations in Europe, Latin America and the United States, where rates are going up.
Meanwhile, Yamana Gold is in the commodities space and is subject to a merger with Gold Fields Ltd. Historically, gold-linked companies have outperformed the market during high i nflation, and having a merger in play provides the cherry on top.
I would add that I am comfortable owning these three positions whether inflation is currently peaking or not; they are good bets either way. This is because they have low valuations, good upside and strong growth prospects, especially in the case of Yamana.
Inflation is aggravating and anxiety-provoking, but there are ways to try to ease the impact. If you are an investor, check your portfolio’s exposure to different asset classes and adjust carefully to an asset allocation aligned with your risk tolerance.
Regardless of investments, look through your personal finances for expense and debt reduction opportunities. And, most importantly of all, stay in the work force, invest in yourself and increase the value you can provide to others. The more of these actions you can take, the better the odds you will not only beat inflation, but thrive in the long term.

Full text: DONE DEAL 135 13 Ave., SW., No. 510, Calgary BELTLINE Asking price: $284,900 (May, 2022) Selling price: $275,000 (June, 2022) Taxes: $1,844 (2021) Days on the market: 41 Listing agent: Bryon Howard, eXp Realty THE ACTION In a 14-year-old highrise a few streets south of the Calgary Tower, this one-bedroom unit was launched shortly after another unit sold in the $280,000s. It seemed sensible to ask for a similar amount, and to turn down an offer in the upper $270,000s on opening day. Unfortunately, it took about a month for another proposal to emerge.
Negotiations raised the offer to $275,000.
“I listed and sold a unit within two weeks of this one in April for $282,000 two floors higher,” said agent Bryon Howard.
“The market started to change as we listed this – meaning it got worse – so we thought we’d sell closer to our list price around $285,000, but we sold for $275,000.”
WHAT THEY GOT This 682-squarefoot unit has walls of windows and sliding balcony doors along the open principal room.
There’s a four-piece bathroom, laundry facilities and stainless-steel kitchen appliances.
The unit comes with one parking spot. Heating and water costs are included in monthly fees of $433.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “It’s pretty typical for a one-bedroom,” Mr. Howard said. “We had investors from Vancouver and Toronto consider it, locals considering it for rentals and short-term rentals as an Airbnb and we had first-time buyers looking at it. In the end, a first-time buyer bought it.”
The building’s location also held appeal. “It’s located in the Beltline, which is a really cool area with a lot of great restaurants and amenities,” Mr. Howard said.
“There’s no gym in the building, but there is one nearby across the street.

Full text: 8265 Highway 20, Smithville, Ont.
SMITHVILLE Asking price: $999,900 (May, 2022) Selling price: $1,050,000 (May, 2022) Taxes: $4,425 (2021) Days on the market: Four Listing agent: Tobias Smulders, Re/Max Escarpment Realty Inc.
THE ACTION This four-bedroom farmhouse sits on a 1.7-acre lot in Smithville, a small town midway between Hamilton and St.
Catharines. Within four days and eager buyer came forward with a slightly overasking offer.
“Buyers were mostly local people leaving the city, wanting more property, which has been a common trend the last couple years,” agent Tobias Smulders said.
“There were not a lot of options, and still now, there are not really a lot of options like that one.”
WHAT THEY GOT This 11/2-storey house has been modified over the years into a modern home with 2,626 square feet of living space. There are new plumbing and septic systems and a revamped kitchen with granite countertops and appliances.
The main floor has a den, an office and a dining room. The living room with a gas fireplace and access to the rear where there is a pool and double garage.
Upstairs, a fifth bedroom was converted into a large walk-in closet for the primary bedroom.
The basement is unfinished.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “There are some subdivisions right in the town of Smithville, but this is on the outskirts, so it’s a bit more country,” Mr. Smulders said.
“It’s also surrounded by a very big plot of land, so it appears even bigger than it really is.”
“It was an old farmhouse, so it was more than 100 years old, which was cool, and usually with old houses they’re quite small, but this was quite big,” Mr. Smulders said.
“One of the draws was it had a lot of original woodwork, trims and doors.”

An architect asks: Where did his design go?: A complex project is always subject to change. But Moshe Safdie says his plan was part of a ‘bait and switch’ deception

Full text: Moshe Safdie is annoyed.
One of the world’s bestknown architects, Mr. Safdie feels he was misused and manipulated by a group of Toronto real-estate developers.
He probably has a point. For a year, Mr. Safdie was the public face of a building project over the rail corridor in the middle of Toronto’s downtown. This was a hotly controversial project, since it would construct private buildings in the same airspace where local politicians had promised an eight-hectare Rail Deck Park.
His name and reputation, Mr. Safdie says, helped the developers win approval for their project at Ontario’s Local Planning Appeal Tribunal (LPAT).
And then in 2021 Mr. Safdie was gone, his plan out the window. “It was a bait and switch,” he said in a recent interview. “We worked with the client for a year in good faith. Then they said, in effect, ‘We have no intention of building this.’ It’s outrageous.”
His clients, led by Craft Development Corp., counter that their project is simply changing to respond to the city’s concerns.
The rail deck story is complicated and quirky, but it touches on a broader issue in Toronto development: The city’s legalistic planning process doesn’t really account for design. On every project, lawyers fight their way through the contradictions in Toronto’s outdated and regressive planning policy. Too often, a beautiful drawing turns out to be a lie.
And so Mr. Safdie’s story rings true. He has a global reputation: His work in Canada includes the National Gallery in Ottawa and, back in 1967, Habitat in Montreal.
The developers, a fairly obscure group of companies, hired Safdie’s firm to win approvals.
And when they won, the provincial tribunal cited the “design creativity and attractiveness” of Safdie’s design.
I disliked some aspects of his rail deck design. But it was clearly a selling point for the developers.
Then Craft went back to local architects – the Toronto firm Sweeny & Co. – who delivered a scheme that is less flashy and guarantees less park space.
“This tactic, starting with a very seductive scheme with a lot of goodies and then in the process these are cut back, is a deceiving process,” Mr. Safdie says. “And the city of Toronto should beware.”
But this is not news in Toronto.
The same process has played out numerous times during this boom. Architects with a strong vision come in to charm the city planners and the neighbours.
Then they get replaced by somebody else who will, as realestate folks say, “value-engineer” the development. For example, the architects Hariri Pontarini designed a huge redevelopment at Bloor and Dufferin streets.
It got approved, then sold, and now the architects Turner Fleischer are stripping away many attractive details.
Why is this allowed to happen?
The Toronto planning process does not control the details of the architecture or landscape until the final stage, known as site plan approval. And Toronto city planners have shown that they fundamentally don’t care about design details. That’s inexplicable and inexcusable, but developers know it’s true. So corners get cut. The reality does not look like the renderings.
This is certainly the case for the rail deck site. The latest Sweeny design is significantly more dense than the Safdie design. And rather than 3.4 hectares of park in the main section, it offers just one hectare, with an option for the city to build more.
“It has become obvious our plan was used as a Trojan Horse,” Mr. Safdie said.
He wants it made clear that he has nothing to do with the current scheme. He strenuously dislikes some aspects of its urban design, most notably the large garages for above-ground parking, which present a wall along part of Front Street.
But was Mr. Safdie’s own design ever a real possibility? He insists that it was. However, I – and several local real-estate professionals I spoke with – were skeptical that such a complex project would be realized and somehow generate enough revenue to build all those parks. From the start his drawings seemed like a sales tool, which would inevitably be replaced by something much less attractive.
And indeed it seems that they were. This week I asked Jim Ilkay, a development manager and a representative for the Craft consortium, why Mr. Safdie was fired. “We did not fire Moshe Safdie,” he said in an email. “Safdie Architects was engaged to develop a concept plan for the LPAT hearing. Their engagement with our firm ended when the hearing concluded.”
The provincial tribunal “was only the start of a conversation with the city,” he added. Forget it, Jake.
It’s Toronto.
A complex project such as this is always subject to change. And in the end it will include a variety of developers and architects, Mr. Ilkay said. That’s all for the best, even if Mr. Safdie doesn’t like it.
But Mr. Safdie makes some good points. Design should have a stronger role in planning. And Toronto’s current system breeds cynicism and frustration: Any attractive vision is probably a mirage. As for the province: If the tribunal is making planning decisions, “they should have a role in making sure the project is realized,” he says.
Mr. Safdie may not have understood how the game is played in Toronto. But it’s also true that the rules should change.

Mismatch between school space, families with children no minor inconvenience: Cities throughout the Lower Mainland and beyond are seeing booms in population but long waits for a place for youth to learn

Full text: When Suzanne Ma and her husband bought their condo in Vancouver’s Olympic Village almost a decade ago, they were told there was a parcel of land next to the nearby park where a school would be built.
The couple thought that, by the time they started a family, the school’s construction would definitely be under way.
They now have a son who is just about to turn 4 and will start Grade 1 next fall. But the neighbourhood school – first identified in city planning documents 15 years ago – is still nowhere in sight.
Last month, the province approved a concept for the school, but there is still no timeline for when it might open.
For Ms. Ma and many other parents in one of the city’s fastestgrowing neighbourhoods, that tiny advance seems meaningless.
“We’re not that much closer to where we were,” she said.
That’s also the state of affairs for thousands of parents in cities throughout the Lower Mainland and other areas that have seen booms in family populations but waits of a decade or more for school spaces. Even when a new school opens, it is sometimes above capacity by the first day.
The problem isn’t unique to Vancouver. Suburbs such as Surrey, Coquitlam and Richmond have seen similar issues for years.
The mismatch between school space and families with children isn’t just a minor inconvenience.
It forces thousands of parents to drive their children to schools where there is room or load them onto buses, both environmentally unsustainable options.
Sarah Payne moved to Burke Mountain in Coquitlam 10 years ago. She bought in a rush, caught up in a high-intensity real estate market, but noticed there was a site up the street that was to be the future home of a Burke Mountain elementary school.
“That was a big reason we moved.”
She has spent most of the past decade driving one child or another to schools much further away, including the neighbouring city of Port Coquitlam.
“It causes mayhem and chaos at drop-off and pickup times,” Ms. Payne said.
In Surrey, Karen Tan, a longtime activist parent, said the district never seems to catch up.
“As soon as a brand-new school is opened, it’s full to capacity,” she said. New schools are being built, but “they’re just chipping off the old list. … It’s so slow.”
Carolyn Broady, the president of the British Columbia School Trustees Association, said other areas have run into the same problem.
“It’s not just in Vancouver,” she said. “We now see it in other places on Vancouver Island as we see the shift of families out of the city.”
Ms. Broady said everyone is struggling to get all the levels of government – school boards, city councils, the province – to work together and ensure that land is set aside early for schools or not sold to developers, that good population projections are done and that there’s an efficient process in place for getting schools built.
“Richmond had a site, but it took so long to get permits that costs went up,” she noted, which only delayed the project further.
Some school districts, such as North Vancouver, have sold schools that were under capacity at the urging of the province, only to find a few years later that a development has brought hundreds of families into the area.
The provincial government acknowledges that there is huge demand for new schools but points to how much building it has already done.
“Since 2017, to date we have invested nearly $2.8-billion for new and expanded schools, seismic upgrades and site purchases for future schools throughout B.C.
This investment includes over 130 major capital projects including 69 new/expansion projects (including site acquisitions) and 59 seismic projects,” said a statement from the Education Ministry. “Under the previous government: 2012 [to] 2017, they invested in 81 major capital projects including 38 expansion projects and 43 seismic projects.”
The ministry did not make anyone available for an interview.
Critics of the current process have pointed out over the years that there are still huge inefficiencies in the way school boards, cities and the province work.
Vic Khanna, the outspoken and frustrated vice-chair of the Vancouver school district’s parent advisory committee, says that board’s enrolment forecasts make no sense.
“The VSB is forecasting a decline, including in areas where the schools today are full, like Henry Hudson, where they have kindergarten lotteries.”
Hudson elementary is also the closest school to the huge new Squamish Nation housing development at the south end of Burrard Bridge, a project that envisions 10,000 new residents within the next 10 years.
Recent census numbers show that the biggest increases in the numbers of school-age children in Vancouver were in areas such as the Olympic Village or the River District, where there is a lot of new apartment development.
But when the Vancouver School Board was asked whether it has planned schools for some of the massive new development on the horizon – through new programs such as the Broadway Plan, the redevelopment of Oakridge into a municipal town centre and several new Indigenous-led developments throughout the city – the board said in a statement that “it is too early to speculate on the student yield” from these projects.
The Regional District of Okanagan-Similkameen endorsed a new plan in 2018 that envisioned more density in certain areas as a way of attracting families to villages such as Naramata, whose elementary school is down from 100 children in 2000 to about 70.
Former regional district director Michael Brydon said there is support for additional density when it is linked to the possibility of saving schools or improving local health care facilities.
The city council in Delta, at one time the archetypal family-oriented suburb, has pushed to allow new housing development in some areas, such as Ladner Village and Scott Road, as its population of school-age children has steadily declined. Last year, it saw almost 300 fewer children in its schools than the year before – about four times the rate of student decrease as Vancouver on a per-capita basis.
But those efforts seem to be rare. Instead, school boards and the province end up in years-long tussles over money for new schools in growing areas when there are schools in other neighbourhoods that are not full.
And the lengthy bureaucratic processes do not seem to be changing.
According to the Vancouver School Board, the long-awaited school near the Olympic Village will need to receive approval of its concept plan, then more detailed feasibility work before, eventually, a capital project funding agreement is reached.
At the moment, the agreement between the board and the province says funding has to be in place and construction started no later than Jan. 31, 2024.
For many parents, that’s simply too late.
Ms. Ma said some families have moved away and some have been commuting to a school. Her family is considering both options, along with sending their son to a private school next year.
“I can say a lot of emotional things to reflect my anger and frustration. But honestly, I just want them to get their ducks in a row and build the school.”

A bumpy real estate market will rattle renters, too: Housing advocate calls for freeze on new legislation that allows for additional rent increases

Full text: VANCOUVER Vancouver property sales have slowed, as sellers are less likely to list their homes. But prices are holding fairly steady in the country’s priciest market. That means for renters, the pressure on the rental market is higher than ever, exacerbated by interest-rate hikes and increased demand. And that pressure could intensify now that landlords have an opportunity to increase rents.
Vancouver Tenants Union advocate Aïssa Aggoune said there’s a general anxiety among renters who are wondering if they will be able to afford their rents in the following months.
“The anxiety is caused by numerous factors which are compounding the already existing housing crisis and turning it into a real nightmare for the local families who live and work in Vancouver,” Mr. Aggoune said.
New legislation introduced a year ago allows an additional rent increase to recoup costs of capital expenditures on apartments, such as updates to electrical and mechanical systems, improving security and energy use. Mr. Aggoune said the new increases have largely gone under the radar.
He’d like to see the increases suspended until inflation comes down.
“The process of fighting these rent increases is very long and exhausting for most tenants who do not even fully understand the legislation,” Mr. Aggoune said.
Rents on newly listed apartments have soared in the past year. According to the Torontobased HouseSigma real estate platform, the median rent for all Metro Vancouver rental listings on the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) went up from $2,500 in June, 2021, to $3,400 in June, 2022.
Realtor and HouseSigma spokesperson Hao Li said there is a key relationship between sales and rentals because when the sales market slows, people stay in rental apartments, increasing demand. As well, those who are experiencing interest-rate hikes as their mortgages renew will pass the cost along to renters if they can.
According to HouseSigma AI generated data (which uses MLS and real estate board statistics), the median price of homes in Delta dropped by 28.3 per cent between February and June, followed by Surrey at a 23.4-per-cent decrease and Maple Ridge about the same. Vancouver home prices dropped 11.7 per cent and West Vancouver by 11.4 per cent. North Vancouver only saw a 5.6-percent drop. Overall, Metro Vancouver saw a 13.5-per-cent decrease in median home price.
A broader perspective, such as that provided by the Canadian Real Estate Association, which looks at the benchmark price over a year, shows a far slower adjustment.
In April, 2022, the benchmark price for all homes in Greater Vancouver reached $1,264,700, according to the Canadian Real Estate Association, a 15-per-cent increase over April, 2021, when that price was $1,099,300.
Today it’s at $1,235,900, a slight decrease of 2.28 per cent – but still much higher than the benchmark price of June, 2021. Benchmark price is the estimated value of a home with typical characteristics.
“Home prices have eased in parts of British Columbia, although the B.C. provincial totals have been propped up by mostly static prices in Greater Vancouver,” the CREA release said.
Mr. Li, who is based in Vancouver, said prices there have not been immediately affected by the higher interest rate, which recently went up a full percentage point to 2.5 per cent. Some suburbs are likely hit harder because of the pandemic phenomenon that saw first-time buyers moving away from the city. That trend has eased up. Vancouver prices are staying strong because instead of reducing their prices, would-be sellers are not selling.
“We’re not yet seeing a significant price drop for the Vancouver area, no,” Mr. Li said. “Sellers know that if they put up their house up for sale now they can’t use the usual tactic, which is to list low and hoping everybody will bid high. Now, everybody’s mindset has shifted into, ‘whatever price you put out, people are more likely to offer something less, rather than bidding more.’ So they are less likely to want to sell their properties, so less inventory.”
Cancellations of listings in Greater Vancouver have gone up by 139.2 per cent since February, according to HouseSigma data.
Real estate agent Patricia Houlihan said some of her clients know it’s better to buy when the market slows, as opposed to the fear-of-missing-out phase during the beginning of the pandemic.
Ms. Houlihan purchased her own home in 2008 just at the start of the economic downturn. There were fewer buyers and offers were subject to sale. The price of her home went down, but then it went back up.
“People who were fighting to buy houses and putting in stupid prices, now they are saying, ‘the market is going down, I’m going to wait.’ Really? Because you can now buy with subjects, and we don’ t get the unicorns right now,” she says, referring to that one buyer who will throw “crazy” money at a property.
“Right now is a great opportunity for buyers, because they can get something and get an inspection and think for a few days, and breathe. But it’s also good for sellers, because prices have gone down less than 2 per cent.”
She’s still seeing multiple offers. There are buyers who aren’t affected by the rate increase, and there are buyers who are in a panic to use their lender rate hold before it ends.
“The rates are still very, very low, as long as people can afford it. I just think the market has not changed enough for all the reaction that is happening.”
Grant Bazian’s job is to be on the lookout for signs of financial distress. Mr. Bazian is president of MNP’s insolvency practice, the largest in Canada, which handles corporate and consumer insolvency such as bankruptcies and liquidations.
An MNP consumer debt index released in April, prepared by Ipsos, showed that British Columbians had the largest drop in disposable income out of all Canadians, spending $269 less than they had a few months previously.
Not helping matters is that Vancouver has some of the highest dollar mortgages in Canada, Mr. Bazian says, making mortgage-holders particularly sensitive to any fluctuation. This week MNP released more bleak news: 27 per cent of Canadians are cutting back on essentials, such as food, utilities and housing costs.
Mr. Bazian was surprised when the Bank of Canada increased its benchmark rate the most it has since 1998, bringing the overnight rate to 2.5 per cent. But such a big jump tells him that there must be serious concerns. The younger generation who’ve only ever known a low interest rate will be particularly alarmed, he said.
“A 100-basis-point jump, that’s something else. I wasn’t expecting that. … I think they are doing their best to control [inflation]. I don’t know how effective it’s going to be, because there are other elements to inflation, other than supply and demand.”
The biggest concern for policy makers is affordability for the average Canadian.
“I think it’s the inability for the average Canadian to afford the necessary household goods, that’s what it comes down to – to afford their mortgage payments, the basic necessities.
“It shows me consumer confidence and their financial well-being are very low. And I think there is a lot of anxiety and stress with families, and a lot of them are uncertain as to what to do and how rising interest rates affect their financial well-being.”

Full text: 733 County Rd. 2 OTONABEE-SOUTHMONAGHAN, ONT.
Asking Price: $4,495,000 Taxes: $8,700 (2021) Lot Size: 140 acres Agents: Nathan and Lori Copeland, Re/Max Rouge River Realty Ltd.
THE BACKSTORY Leslie Bradford met bush pilot Peter Scott 12 years ago when she hitched a ride in his Cessna to Killarney Provincial Park for a solo hiking trip.
“He volunteered to drop me off in the middle of the provincial park, and he picked me up, and we’ve been together ever since.”
Mr. Scott, a retired farmer from Yorkshire, England, had immigrated to Canada to pursue his lifelong dream of flying a float plane. Ms. Bradford-Scott was a former member of the U.S. Coast Guard who also had long aspired to become a pilot.
Mr. Scott taught her to fly and, along the way, the two married.
As they settled into their new life, they began to look for a farm for sale. The couple’s search was slowed by one quirky requirement: the farm had to come with a runway.
After two years of searching, they found the property they were looking for on the north shore of Rice Lake in rolling hills near Peterborough, Ont.
The heritage farm offered 140 acres of fields and forest sloping down to 2,000 feet of unspoiled shoreline. It also provided a 1,850foot runway, hangar and float plane launch. The owner was a pilot, as was the owner before.
The farm popped up on an obscure property website for private deals, says Ms. Bradford-Scott.
Once they found it, the couple were disappointed to learn it had recently sold.
Their luck turned when that deal fell apart and the Scotts stepped up to purchase the farm.
Peterborough County is located on the Treaty 20 Michi Saagiig territory and in the traditional territory of the Michi Saagiig and Chipewa Nations, collectively known as the Williams Treaties First Nation.
The Scotts learned that the land was part of a 200-acre parcel settled by James Dawson, who also moved to Canada from Yorkshire. Local records show the homestead was built in 1850 with bricks produced on the property.
The Dawsons raised dairy cattle and crops on the estate, which remained in the family for generations.
By the time the Scotts took possession nine years ago, the two-storey house was in disrepair, the fields were overgrown with weeds and the century barn was on the verge of tumbling down.
THE HOUSE TODAY The traditional farmhouse had served as a vacation rental for several years and the interior was badly neglected, Ms. BradfordScott says.
They rejuvenated the mainfloor principal rooms and renovated kitchen, then refurbished the upstairs, where they installed new floors, renovated the bathrooms and added closets to the bedrooms.
Today the house has five bedrooms and three bathrooms.
There’s a main-floor office and a sunroom with heated floors.
While the work was underway inside, Mr. Scott turned to clearing the weeds.
“Peter, being a farmer, knew exactly what to do outside,” Ms. Bradford-Scott says.
The agricultural land was restored and rented to a neighbour, who continues to grow soybeans and wheat.
As they improved the property, the Scotts made a determined effort to preserve the antique barn.
“We could only find two people to restore it – everybody else said it was too far gone,” Ms. BradfordScott recalls.
The young couple who took on the project were planning to marry at the end of the summer, so the Scotts invited them to use the restored barn as a wedding venue.
They held their nuptials on the elevated terrace overlooking the water.
“It’s a great spot to have a party,” Ms. Bradford-Scott says.
Once they were settled in, Ms. Bradford-Scott began making soaps and lotions in the laundry room and selling them from the back of her pick-up truck. Today her business, which is not for sale, has grown into a full line of natural beauty products that she makes on the farm.
The Scotts keep their vintage red-and-white Piper Cub on the property. They often venture out over the nearby Kawartha Lakes, Ms. Bradford-Scott says, or fly into Killarney, where the couple’s romance began. The pilots also fly out of nearby Peterborough Airport, where they keep two additional planes.
THE BEST FEATURE Ms. Bradford-Scott says the property is ideally suited for an aviator, but the 28-kilometre-long Rice Lake is also popular for boating and fishing. When the lake freezes over, adventurers gather for ice sailing and motorcycle racing.
During their tenure, the Scotts have created winding trails through the woods and fields for year-round hiking and skiing in winter.
“I hike on the farm every day – that’s my mid-day break,” Ms. Bradford-Scott says.
Wildlife that meander onto the property include deer, foxes, wild turkey and coyotes.
Most of the farm’s natural shoreline is protected conservation land, she adds.
“It will always be protected – that’s what I love about it.”

The growing challenge of a shrinking population: In once-bustling Mississauga, some areas are hollowing out as development is pushed into its central space

Full text: Mississauga was the only major city in Canada to shrink in the last census, a decline that is being blamed on the pandemic but reflects yearslong population drops in dozens of its neighbourhoods.
Two-thirds of Mississauga census tracts shrank over the past five years, even as the city pushed intense development into its central area. While that high-rise district gives the appearance of a booming city, less visible is the hollowing out of neighbourhoods, which makes it harder to run nearby businesses, fill schools or justify money for local civic priorities.
This is not unique to Mississauga. Many of Canada’s biggest cities are dotted with neighbourhoods that steadily lose people.
It’s a growing urban challenge that struggles for attention amid overall population growth and stock media images of crane-dotted skylines.
These are not blighted neighbourhoods. Their populations are shrinking because of deliberate municipal policies. For decades, city planners have pushed most density to a handful of spots in order to shield established areas from development pressure.
That’s what happened in Mississauga. For many years, the city embraced sprawl and only recently started to allow serious density. But most of the city remains single-family homes, which have gradually emptied out as children moved away and new owners had smaller families.
Mississauga’s neighbourhood loss shows up most starkly in two census tracts.
One, made up largely of an old-style suburban neighbourhood of roomy houses on leafy streets, in the Cooksville area, is down 16.2 per cent over the past decade.
Another, farther to the north, near Eglinton Avenue and Highway 403, is a newer and more compact subdivision dominated by homes with garages on the front. Its population is down 14.3 per cent in a decade.
The low-rise part of the Cooksville census tract presented as eerily empty during a visit. Pedestrians initially appeared outnumbered by garbage crews. Locals were friendly, but there were very few of them. No one was using the neighbourhood park, where a prominent sign urges people to report alcohol consumption, off-leash dogs or suspicious behaviour.
Population loss can go unnoticed in a place that was deliberately designed to be quiet. Roads here are either cul-de-sacs or designed to stop through traffic.
Large lots mean there have always been few people by hectare, even in the context of a low-density city.
Bill Bailey, who has lived in a house there for 49 years, was surprised to hear about the local population loss, saying he felt he’d seen an increase of young families.
“You can’t find properties like this any more,” he said.
But he also said that, in his time, he’s had seven or eight neighbours cycle through next door. And the retired banker, who called himself a semi-widower, with his wife in long-term care, pointed to the properties of a few widows living nearby.
Another indication of the aging local population appears in enrolment trends at nearby schools. This census tract is in the catchment area for four schools, three of which have fewer students than 10 years ago.
The overall student body at the four schools, which draw from more than just this particular census tract, is down 5.9 per cent in the past decade, according to the Peel District School Board (PDSB).
Although the population has declined here at a higher rate than anywhere else in the city, smaller losses across Mississauga have undermined enrolment at numerous schools.
As far back as 2017, a PDSB report urging the shutdown of a secondary school warned that some board facilities were seeing such shrinking student bodies that it was threatening the quality of education.
It’s one sign that Mississauga is a maturing suburb – families grow up and their children move out – with the added pressure of rising real estate prices pushing many young people from the city. And the loss of residents is a headache beyond the local school board.
“For maintenance [of local infrastructure], you’re paying more per capita, and it starts to get kind of impractical,” said Karen Chapple, director of the School of Cities at the University of Toronto. “Many of [these neighbourhoods] developed 40 to 50 years ago, where they’re just kind of needing reinvestment in them now. And it starts to not make sense to reinvest and revitalize all the infrastructure if you have declining population. So then that leads to declining quality of life in the area and then kind of a downward spiral for the neighbourhood.”
But in many established neighbourhoods across Canada, enough residents fight change – under the banner of protecting local character – that adding the density that could help the population rebound remains politically toxic.
Protecting these areas from density hasn’t stopped them evolving, though. Year by year, the number of people in the street declines.
This is happening even though Canada has the fewest housing units per capita among G7 countries and the fact that higher levels of government agitate for more construction. In this year’s federal budget, Ottawa said the country needs to double its annual output of housing units.
And if population loss goes too far, it can create a sense of solitude, even isolation.
“It’s unhealthy on a neighbourhood level,” said urbanist and writer Charles Montgomery, author of The Happy City.
“If you walk around some of these neighbourhoods on Vancouver’s west side, you do not see people any more. I’ve talked to folks who’ve lived in these neighbourhoods for generations – they tell me they feel lonely.
They used to see kids on the streets.”
Mississauga’s head of planning defends the policy of continuing to concentrate most of the city’s growth in certain areas, while acknowledging that his predecessors may have done a bit too good of a job protecting the lowdensity parts of the city.
“In hindsight, could we have allowed a little bit more gentle intensification? Yes, probably,” said Andrew Whittemore, though he also argued that the house neighbourhoods “offer a lot, and that’s why people like Mississauga.”
“Those neighbourhoods do get infill. It’s just primarily concentrated on the main arterials that run through those communities. So they are experiencing it too, and trust me, each of those neighbourhoods have a lot to say when we’re infilling along their corridors. It’s not – they’re not kind of getting off scot-free here.”
Mississauga Mayor Bonnie Crombie said that at the core of the issue in her city is aging people who are effectively “overhoused,” but unwilling to move or unable to find a suitable new home.
“Empty-nesters haven’t moved on yet to more appropriate accommodation, allowing growing families to move in,” she said.
“It’s an affordability issue for everyone. You know, we see that the seniors don’t necessarily want to downsize because they look around and see that the price of housing is so dear right now that there isn’t anything affordable within their reach.”
Mississauga has been trying to broaden beyond its history as a city of almost entirely suburban detached homes. Planners are starting to embrace – or at least become more open to – what is sometimes called “gentle density.” This refers to strictly limited intensification such as triplexes and granny suites that can add people without changing the look of a neighbourhood.
Subdivisions built in recent years are also more dense than that census tract in Cooksville.
Properties are narrower and smaller homes are more common. Ms. Crombie said that when adjacent properties in a house neighbourhood go on the market, the buildings are often replaced by a row of townhomes.
Mississauga had no choice but to change its approach. The city is currently developing its last piece of untouched land. A place that has for decades been defined by constant sprawl has run up against its natural limits. And without a steady stream of new neighbourhoods, depopulation threatens to become worse.
Jason Bevan, the city’s planning strategies director, explained that there is a correlation between the age of a neighbourhood and its demographics.
Newer developments tend to have younger residents and more family households, which gradually become empty-nesters.
While a next generation of families eventually comes in to replace them, the numbers typically don’t rebound completely.
“It tends to never quite reach the peak of a population that a neighbourhood would have when the dwelling units are kind of within 10 years old,” he said.

Full text: 214 Minnesota St.
COLLING WOOD, ONT.
Asking Price: $2,299,999 Taxes: $6,214 (2021) Lot Size: 60- by 120-feet Agents: Sherry Rioux, Clairwood Real Estate THE BACKSTORY It was a sunny day in July seven years ago when the future owners of 214 Minnesota St., in Collingwood, Ont., stepped onto the backyard patio and pool area and decided this was the place to retire.
However, Scottish poet Robbie Burns once coined a turn of phrase about the best-laid plans of mice and men, and for Pamela Campbell some parts of the move north from Aurora, Ont., did go awry.
“My husband was going to retire, but he did not retire, so now he only comes up on weekends,” Ms. Campbell said. A planned sale of his small business was put on hold due to circumstances beyond their control. Previously, the couple had only visited the town on weekends together, so with weekdays to herself the retired consultant got on the waiting lists for a few “Probus” clubs in the area. To her delight, she got into two.
Probus social clubs began forming in the 1960s and 70s as an offshoot of Rotary clubs in Britain, Australia and New Zealand. Typically made up of retired professionals, according to Probus Canada the first one here was formed in 1987 and there are now at least 245 with more than 36,000 members across the country.
“You meet once a month and in that meeting maybe they will have a speaker come in – like a beekeeper or an astrologer – or you go on tours to a glass factory or a local brewery,” Ms. Campbell said.
“There are committees within them; there’s a ski legend club where they go to all the private clubs, and take ski trips to Europe and out West. There’s a cinema club where they bring TIFF movies up and they even have a group that goes to Sudbury for its films festival.”
Ms. Campbell is of the view that Collingwood is particularly full of retired professionals, an impression backed up by Statistics Canada data that show the town of 24,811 has 50 per cent more residents between the ages of 55 to 75 than those ages 35 to 55.
“When you stop working you lose your work friends,” Ms. Campbell said. “You come here, you want to take an art class, you want to go to lifelong learning, the theatre club. … It is a phenomenal community that way.
People here that are highly educated, highly skilled and everyone is in the same position where they are keen to meet people.” THE HOUSE TODAY There are two structures on the property, the main house and a garage/coach house with a separate apartment above. The reproduction Victorian home – built on one of Collingwood’s most desirable downtown streets in 1998 – has four bedrooms and five bathrooms, the coach house has one bed (but can sleep more) and one bath. With some fine brickwork details such as soldiering above the windows and exterior doors, a turret that rises above the peaked roof and gingerbread woodwork on the covered front porch that stretches the width of the house the home performs better at the eye test than most new-builds with period design inspiration.
Inside, the sharp lines and wide spaces bely the Victorian style (which is often quite cramped indoors) the front door opens to centre hall that travels straight back to the kitchen with an open sitting room on the right and a wide stairwell that climbs to the second level on the left.
The sitting room features a large sectional that wraps around the corner with the turret windows.
The kitchen has Victorian echoes, but on a modern template where the back half of the house is completely turned over to prep and dining space.
“The kitchen was Canadiana in pine and reproduction old-fashioned appliances … the stove looked like it was woodburning. We took out wall for dining room and kitchen, made it one large room and put in all brand new Corinthian Kitchen cabinets [made in nearby Thornbury, Ont.] all in white,” Ms. Campbell said.
There is storage and white wood paneling everywhere, the hardware and fixtures area all silver and stainless steel, the range hood is massive, the counters and backsplash are quartz, the ceiling is coffered and there are two sliding glass doors out to the rear deck on opposite sides of the kitchen. “We have the full set of ‘kitchen jewellery’ – Miele appliances, standalone fridge and freezer, built-in oven – it’s all top of the line,” Ms. Campbell said.
When they redid the kitchen they also updated the laundry room, and put in a full wet-bar and wine cellar in the basement, and there’s another guest room down there as well.
On the second floor there are three bedrooms, with one shared guest bathroom and an ensuite connected to the primary bedroom. The bed in the primary suite sits inside the turret, which here feels like a tower with its windows on all sides and height that rises up another 10 feet above the ceiling with a second row of windows above. It’s a lot of light, but some clever automation helps keep it private and dark at bedtime. “You hit a button and blackout blinds close on either side of each window panes, and with the silk curtains there is no light. You hit the button again and everything goes up,” Ms. Campbell said.
HOME IS FOR SHARING “You find when you move to Collingwood, all your friends want to come and visit,” said Ms. Campbell, who saw a slight slowdown at the beginning of the pandemic but a huge ramp-up in visits as people got their vaccinations.
“We can house up to 20 people; you can have a fabulous time: We make gourmet dinners, or we can walk to the local restaurants, and we don’t have to worry about drinking or driving.”
The coach house, with spiral staircase down to the rear-yard pool patio, is a particular draw. “People who bring kids, for the little people it’s good to have their own separate place with a full shower and kitchenette.”
From local life to visits from afar, Collingwood remains Ms. Campbell’s home and they are looking to move elsewhere in town. Now if only she can make sure her husband retires for good this time.

Full text: VANCOUVER In response to a new tax, property investors freed up an estimated 20,000 rental homes for British Columbians, according to a recent report, which proves that the one-of-a-kind Canadian tax measure is having the intended impact.
The province of B.C. recently released a report it commissioned on the tax introduced in 2018 by the NDP government, the speculation and vacancy tax (SVT). The intent of the tax was to target empty homes and to address speculation and foreign money that had flowed into the market.
Each year, every B.C. homeowner must complete a declaration as to whether they’ve lived in their home for at least six months, and how much income tax they’re paying in Canada.
The data helps determine the true nature of foreign wealth that flows into the housing market, from both foreign buyers and those who have citizenship but earn their incomes outside Canada, called satellite families. Industry experts say that because it collects data on income tax, it’s a treasure trove of information on those who’ve made windfalls without paying their fair share of taxes.
Andy Yan, director of the Simon Fraser University City Program, was the first researcher to address the problem of empty homes in a report he wrote back in 2009, when he worked as a planner and data analyst for Bing Thom Architects.
“This is how supply and demand measures can lead to 20,000 units of housing – not just with the swing of a hammer and new construction, but with the stroke of a pen and new legislation,” he says.
The report, prepared by University of B.C. real estate finance professor Tsur Somerville and analyst Jake Wetzel, estimates that the 20,000 homes were added to the secondary rental market between 2018 and 2020, after the tax was introduced.
But because of the disruption caused by COVID-19 that began in 2020, the question as to whether the SVT has so far led to greater affordability remains unanswered.
“I would say the data give a consistent message of improved conditions for first-time buyers, and improved conditions for renters,” said Prof. Somerville. “But there is nothing that suggests that this is a major movement in the needle on affordability.”
Still, the report underscores the market impact of global wealth when competing with local incomes, particularly its impact on renters, says Prof. Somerville. A non-resident owner is a person who is not a full-time resident of Canada, regardless of citizenship. Non-residents purchased an estimated 16-per-cent of condos built from 2016 to 2017 in the Vancouver census metropolitan area, the highest by far in all CMA study areas, according to the report. Nanaimo, Victoria and Kelowna also had a “striking” amount of non-resident ownership.
“This problem is undoubtedly graver as these data do not include Canadian citizens who own property but for whom a majority of their income is untaxed worldwide income,” says the report.
“Here there is a clear consensus that foreign demand or demand for second houses raises local house prices. This makes ownership more difficult for prospective first-time buyers. This effect is larger if the wealth used to acquire these properties is from outside the local market,” says the report.
There is a multiplier effect.
Owners who receive windfalls go on to pay higher prices in other neighbourhoods – or pass along the gains to children. Prof. Somerville cautions that we still don’t really know how those windfalls have been spent.
He believes the SVT should stay, especially because it addresses empty units; however, he wouldn’t raise it.
“It is important, but as many of us said in advance, this is not going to solve the problem.”
Unfortunately, it took years to establish that there even was a problem. When Mr. Yan was working to determine the possible number of condos that sat vacant, government was not collecting data on foreign money. He had to get resourceful. His 2009 report looked at an indicative sample of downtown condominiums using BC Hydro and land titles data that showed 5 to 8 per cent were empty. In addition to the empty condos, he found that 50 per cent of the study condos were non-owner occupied. That number has not changed.
Many in the housing industry, and politicians and some academics, treated the assertion that foreign money was having an effect, or that so many homes were sitting empty, with skepticism.
Finally, the Liberal government tracked real estate purchases one summer and discovered that, in a four-week period, foreign buyers had picked up more than $1-billion worth of property in B.C. They introduced the foreign buyer tax in 2016.
In 2017, the newly elected NDP government introduced tax measures that included the all-new SVT, which went beyond the foreign buyer tax and applied a 2per-cent tax on those who might have citizenship, but were earning most of their incomes elsewhere. Citizens and permanent residents who aren’t using the homes at least six months of the year pay 0.5 per cent on the assessed value. Owners are exempt from the tax if they rent out the property.
According to the new report, government has collected $231million in revenue from the SVT since it was introduced in 2018.
Simon Fraser University political science professor Stewart Prest says the question of whether the SVT is boosting affordability will take a few more years to determine.
“I think ultimately if supply met demand you wouldn’t have speculation, so you wouldn’t need to control speculation,” says Prof. Prest. “Part of the reason why [real estate] attracts speculation is it is seen as a scarce resource. If not scarce there would be less speculation.”
He adds that the tax is “a good stop-gap measure.”
However, it’s unclear if any amount of supply would satisfy the demand when buyers are global. New York faces demand from foreign buyers from everywhere, as well as domestic investors.
Suzanne Miller founded Empire State Properties in 1991. The New York company specializes in sales and rentals of investor properties. The foreign buyer comprises more than half of Ms. Miller’s buyers. She manages more than 500 short-term properties for her clients, and they are all full, rented to corporate workers for an average of two or three months. Her foreign owners are from countries around the world, including Canada. They typically purchase a $1-million unit that’s about 600 square feet and her company rents it out for around $6,000 a month to a corporate renter, she says. Her average investor client owns about two or three units.
Ms. Miller says business is better than ever.
“I’ve never seen rents or sales like I’m having this year. It’s on fire,” says Ms. Miller.
“They love the model. [Real estate] is like a triple-A bond. We do direct deposit, and take care of move outs, the security, and the utilities. They do nothing other than get a direct deposit to their account.”
But constrained supply will eventually drive up prices, she says.
“I think there will be a small dip between now and the end of the year, and in January it will be gangbusters again because there’s not a lot of supply and a lot of developers are not building.”
Marketer Jacky Chan, president of BakerWest Real Estate, concedes that there is the possibility that supply may never meet the demand for housing – particularly with offshore and domestic investor demand so high. He’s in favour of accepting foreign capital that operates separately from the domestic buyer. For example, only allow non-residents to buy new homes or vacant land, which is the Australian approach.
“Then you can really segregate the two markets. It would be very silly to reject all foreign investments in real estate as a country but if we allow them, the foreigners, to buy and invest in a particular type of product, and in development, then we can take control of that supply and demand.
“If they want to come to Canada, they should pay a premium on this type of product where the locals would not have to compete with them. I think that already solves 50 per cent of the question.”

Full text: Paradise Square, Canadian impresario Garth Drabinsky’s first Broadway show since serving a prison sentence for fraud, is closing after an unprofitable short run and the production is facing allegations of unpaid wages and dues.
Following an out-of-town tryout in Chicago last fall, the musical, set during the American Civil War, began previews in New York in March and opened on April 3. However, Paradise Square never caught on at the box office – even after receiving 10 Tony Award nominations, and winning one – and has not recovered its US$15-million investment.
With the production bleeding red ink, the show will stop running on Sunday and two U.S.
unions are taking separate legal action against business entities behind the production, claiming a total of nearly US$380,000 in alleged unpaid wages and dues.
Mr. Drabinsky, a co-founder of Cineplex Inc. and the former chief executive officer of Livent Inc., was once one of the biggest names in Canadian entertainment.
Through Livent, he produced the musical hits Phantom of the Opera and Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat in Canada, as well as Ragtime and Fosse – which won the Tony for Best Musical in 1999 – on Broadway.
However, Livent filed for bankruptcy protection in 1998 and Mr. Drabinsky and his former business partner Myron Gottlieb were charged with misstating the company’s financial statements. Livent eventually collapsed under a mountain of debt and both men served time in jail.
Mr. Drabinsky was released from jail on full parole in 2014, but three years later, the Ontario Securities Commission permanently banned him from becoming a director or officer of any public company in Ontario.
With his legal struggles fading, Mr. Drabinsky went back to producing, first attempting to return to Broadway with a musical called Sousatzka, which stalled after its out-of-town tryout in Toronto was poorly received in 2017.
He then turned his attention to Paradise Square, which explored the community built among a neighbourhood of Irish immigrants and African Americans.
Despite mixed reviews, the show earned 10 Tony nominations and it won one for lead actress Joaquina Kalukango. However, the show failed to attract a sustainable audience in a recovery season for New York’s commercial theatre district that has been challenging for many producers.
“We wanted to give Paradise Square every chance to succeed, but various challenges proved insurmountable,” Mr. Drabinsky said in a press release, noting that the pandemic had stunted the production’s success, including a major shutdown less than two weeks after its opening night.
Actors’ Equity Association, a U.S. union based in New York City, is involved in an arbitration process, seeking nearly US$190,000 in alleged unpaid union dues, benefits and interest it claims Paradise Square Production Services Inc., the show’s production company, failed to pay as part of a settlement agreed upon in May, according to union spokesperson David Levy.
“Equity is pursuing every avenue available to ensure the actors and stage managers of Paradise Square receive everything their contract guarantees them,” said Mr. Levy in an e-mail.
Meanwhile, United Scenic Artists, Local USA 829, is seeking US$190,000 in alleged unpaid wages and benefits, which it says it has not yet received from Paradise Square Broadway Limited Partnership, a separate entity affiliated with the production, according to union spokesperson Josh Austin.
In April, the union filed a grievance alleging the production had violated the collective bargaining agreement by failing to make certain payments to the show’s designers, according to documents submitted by the union to the U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of New York.
In June, a judge sided with the union, requiring that the production company pay the union a total award of US$156,965, plus legal fees and accrued interest, by Dec.
1.
United Scenic Artists is now requesting confirmation and enforcement of the court award, according to the documents.
Mr. Drabinsky did not respond to requests for comment, and a spokesperson for the production declined to answer questions about either legal case. Mr. Drabinsky told The New York Times in April that, though credited as the lead producer, he was not in charge of the show’s finances.
Bernard Abrams, who is listed as chief executive officer of Paradise Square Broadway Limited Partnership on forms submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, did not respond to a request for comment.
The show initially raised US$13.5-million to fund its development and production costs, and later raised an additional US$1.5-million, according to the SEC documents.
According to data from Broadway League, a U.S.-based industry organization, Paradise Square earned US$266,926 in the first week of July – the second-last of its run – down about US$30,000 from the week before. In its highest week, mid-June, it grossed nearly US$390,000.
The box-office revenues were not sufficient to cover the show’s weekly operating costs which, according to Forbes, were estimated at US$598,400.
Among the Canadian investors in the show were Richard Stursberg, former executive at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation; real estate construction company owners Hunter and Mariana Milborne; and Rick Chad, a long-time supporter of Mr. Drabinsky‘s work. Lobbyist and former Democratic congressman Joe Crowley was also an investor.
Mr. Stursberg maintains that, had it not been for the pandemic, the show would have prospered, noting that the performing arts sector has suffered over the last two years as shutdowns have hampered production momentum. He also said it was unfortunate timing for Mr. Drabinsky’s return to producing.
“He had a tough time over the last little while, and to finally get back with a great show and have it fall apart has to be a terrible disappointment,” Mr. Stursberg told The Globe and Mail.

Home sales in cottage country may have slowed, but a rise in supply hasn’t dampened rental market boom

Full text: When Tara Rudd and her husband bought a cottage with a view of Ontario’s Lake Couchiching in January, they planned to quickly renovate the home and flip it in the spring. But when they put the updated house on the market in May, they received just one offer, which turned out to be a bust. In no rush to sell, the pair switched gears two weeks ago and entered a market that, despite recent economic jitters, has barely cooled, if it has at all: vacation rentals in cottage country.
“It only took three days to get it fully booked,” Ms. Rudd said.
The recent buying frenzy in Ontario cottage country may have finally come to an end, but demand for rentals, particularly higher-end properties, remains high, despite an increase in supply over last summer.
A year ago, Ms. Rudd and her husband would have had no problem selling the one-storey, open-concept cottage. With closed international borders limiting options for vacationers and many urban dwellers working from home, buyers flooded cottage country during the first two years of the pandemic. As sales jumped, so did prices. Real estate agent Alexis Victor said one property on the Severn River attracted 78 offers. But as the Bank of Canada began to raise interest rates this spring, Ms. Victor said, “the tap turned off.”
For the same reason that sales boomed during the early days of the pandemic, so did vacation rentals. “All you needed was four walls and a lake, and you could easily rent out your home for the last two years,” said Craig White, the owner and operator of CottageLINK Rental Management.
Former Olympic snowboarder Alexandra Duckworth manages two cottages in Kingsburg, N.S.
She said she’s experiencing the same level of demand this summer as last year. The same appears true on the West Coast.
“It’s a zoo, man,” said Uclueletbased realtor Judy Gray. If Canadians are forgoing local getaways for international travel, after the lifting of many pandemic travel restrictions, Europeans and Americans seem to be taking their place, she said.
But while demand remains strong, Mr. White said rental prices have generally come back down to earth because of a few factors, specifically an increase in supply in many recreational areas, the reopening of international travel routes, inflation and rising fuel prices. With more places available, owners offering low-to-mid-range cottages shouldn’t expect to make the same money they may have in the past two summers, he added.
According to data shared by AirDNA, a vacation rental research firm, the number of rental listings in Ontario cottage country – which includes Parry Sound, Seguin, Muskoka, Haliburton County, Kawartha, Bancroft, Hastings Highlands, Dysart, Greater Madawaska and Prince Edward County – has increased almost 20 per cent over last July.
Still, AirDNA’s numbers show that vacationers in Ontario cottage country are paying, on average, 11 per cent more in U.S.
dollars than they were at this time last year and almost 50 per cent more than in July, 2019.
According to the firm’s latest figures, the average daily rate for vacation homes this month has also increased since last year on the South Shore of Nova Scotia, in Canmore, Alta., in Tofino and Ucluelet on Vancouver Island and on British Columbia’s Gulf Islands.
Mr. White has identified an emerging trend in the cottage rental market – something he’s dubbed a “flight to quality.” It may explain why higher-end properties have yet to see their prices fall this summer.
“The more boxes that a cottage ticks, the better it will do,” he said.
That’s been Sandra Sommers’s experience, too. The Barrie, Ont., resident has rented out three cottages in the Haliburton area for more than 10 years. In that time, she’s watched the demands of cottagegoers rise significantly.
“They want everything,” Ms. Sommers said. Where once people escaped to the backcountry in search of a simpler existence, now they expect the same comforts they enjoy at home – specifically good internet service.
Though this spring was quieter than last year, all of Ms. Sommers’s cottages are fully booked for the summer. Now, her main concern is tracking down a cleaner who can work Fridays.
“You can’t find them,” she said. “That is my No. 1 nightmare.”
The influx of new residents into cottage country has created a surge in demand for labourers and tradespeople in those areas – and raised their rates, Mr. White said. It’s among several reasons why it has become more costly to own and operate a cottage rental, along with rising interest rates, inflation and, soon, higher property taxes, after many cottage properties saw their values skyrocket during the pandemic.
Ms. Rudd plans to once again show the new cottage to potential buyers in mid-August. However, she’s now considering keeping it to rent out. The cottage sits on a popular snowmobile trail that attracts scores of ice fishermen in the winter, and there’s minimal accommodation nearby: “Maybe I should keep it for a year and see how it goes?” So far, the noxious mix of inflation and recessionary worries hasn’t stopped people from heading to the lake. Mr. White believes his industry will remain strong in the long term.
“I don’t see the [rental] demand disappearing any time soon,” he said.
“To rent a cottage in the summer – it’s one of the most Ontario things you can do.”

After floods, Merritt weighs whether to rebuild or retreat from water’s edge

Full text: Janine Cooper travels daily from her temporary lodging outside Merritt, B.C., to her single-wide trailer in town to work at restoring her flooddamaged home. She is what the city’s mayor refers to as a climate refugee, displaced when the Coldwater River topped its banks last November in a one-in-athousand-years flood event. The entire town was evacuated at the time, and many homes remain uninhabitable.
Ms. Cooper fled her home in the middle of the night on Nov. 15. Amid the din of children screaming and the roar of the river, she only had time to grab a litter of puppies, dog food and her husband’s ashes.
When she was finally allowed to return in February, her home was filled with a thick layer of frozen mud. She needed an axe to clear a path inside. Few of her belongings survived, but she was among the more fortunate: Three of her neighbours’ homes washed down the river.
She wants to move back permanently, but the decision is not hers alone. Merritt is wrestling with a question that some other Canadian communities have already dealt with: Should it rebuild as before, or pull back from the water’s edge?
Constance Bay in Ontario was rebuilt after massive flooding of the Ottawa River in 2017. In 2019, the community was flooded again. And rebuilt. This May, hundreds of residents were asked to evacuate when flooding returned once more.
Just 30 kilometres away, across the river, many residents of Pointe-Gatineau, Que., opted to accept provincial government buyouts to relocate after the 2019 floods.
But some homeowners remain, and they were also at risk in the spring.
Later this year, the federal government will present its strategy for climate adaptation, and managed retreat will play a role.
The effects of climate change are increasing in frequency, severity – and cost.
Ottawa’s disaster relief payments are spiralling, and it hopes that strategic investments to improve resiliency in at-risk communities will save money in the long run.
A report prepared for Natural Resources Canada in 2020 concluded that the full cost of “persisting in place, with rebuilding accommodations, is double or more the cost of retreat.”
But it isn’t always an easy sell, and can be hard to do well.
Merritt Mayor Linda Brown doesn’t relish the tough choices ahead. The city was established 130 years ago as a ranching community at the confluence of the Coldwater and Nicola rivers.
The abundant water supply for cattle made sense then. Now the community is exposed to the risks of a changing climate.
“A lot of individuals do not want to put their head down next to the river, wondering if it’s going to do the same thing over the next little while, or whether they’re going to be safe,” Ms. Brown said.
“And we can’t give them that assurance.”
Canada’s Minister of Emergency Preparedness, Bill Blair, visited Merritt this spring to talk to people living with the uncertainty of whether they can, or should, rebuild their homes.
“Everywhere I go, I see the local officials and people who’ve been impacted by these events. And it’s very clear that there has been a number of communities that have been built in areas that are high risk – and the risk is changing as well,” he said in an interview.
“What used to be 100-year flooding events have been far more frequent.”
The federal government is working to produce better flood mapping, and he says bluntly what some local politicians are loath to say: “Frankly, it doesn’t make a lot of sense to rebuild in an area that is at high risk of future disaster events. And so we want to make sure that people can make informed decisions.”
In 2013, Alberta experienced the most destructive flood in its recorded history. In the community of High River, more than 80 per cent of homes were inundated.
Today, the town bills itself as one of the most flood-protected communities in North America.
Part of the solution was better flood mitigation works, but two neighbourhoods were also removed from the floodplain.
Craig Snodgrass led the retreat.
He is serving his third term as mayor of High River. To update his portrait for city hall, he chose as a backdrop the green space where estate homes once overlooked the Highwood River.
The transformation of the former Beachwood estates and Wallaceville, one of the town’s oldest neighbourhoods, back to the natural floodplain habitat is a symbol of his work.
“Now there are walking paths, mountain bikers, people walking their dogs – it’s just a nature area, it’s a great massive addition to our greenspace,” Mr. Snodgrass said.
“There are always people pressuring to build – they forget about the flooding real quick. But we have been firm, nothing is going back in there.”
Local governments need to bear some responsibility for allowing developments in the first place, he said.
Quebec has relied on buyouts as part of its disaster recovery plan. In 2019, Quebec Premier François Legault urged homeowners in floodplains not to rebuild, offering up to $200,000 each to move instead.
Although the buyouts for properties at risk of repeated overland flooding are voluntary, the province dangles a stick: It has set a lifetime limit on disaster aid and bans rebuilding in designated flood zones.
Many residents in Pointe-Gatineau accepted the buyout. More than 200 properties have been transferred to the city, or are in the process of being transferred.
When the community faced a flood warning again in late May, far fewer homes were in the danger zone. But 163 buildings and 508 people were still at risk.
In Alberta, High River’s Mr. Snodgrass acknowledges that relocation can be a tough sell. Telling the residents of Wallaceville and Beachwood that they would have to take a buyout was the low point of his political career.
“I never want to be in a meeting like that again,” he said. “I had families crying at the table. … But it was an honest decision, we didn’t put any butterflies around it.”
Trying to make decisions in response to a disaster is especially tough. People are struggling with the ordeals that forced them out – and it can take a year or more before different levels of government can come up with the cash and planning needed.
As the months go by, however, it gets more difficult to tell people to abandon their efforts to go home.
Ms. Cooper has been scrubbing her way to recovery, slowly assembling a kitchen out of salvaged cupboards and counters, a used fridge and stove, and some new wallpaper. But there is no plumbing yet and her beloved garden has been reduced to a tiny patch of daylilies that emerged out of the mud in May.
“It’s still nice here. I don’t think we are going to get hit again. And now I’ve got a new kitchen,” she said. “I’m doing all this work, I’m not moving. It’s my home.” She did consider walking away, but it would be too expensive. She had no insurance, and lives on a small pension. “I can’t afford rent.”
Teri McMillan is also waiting for power and water to be returned to the trailer park. She has exhausted her finances trying to fix up her home since November, and when the spring freshet threatened another flood, she was constantly checking the river.
“I’m crossing my fingers, hoping and praying it won’t happen again,” she said. “I don’t necessarily want to stay. I can’t afford to leave.”
Merritt’s existing floodplain maps show that much of the city is built where the Nicola River is inclined to flood. Mike Goetz’s home on the Coldwater River, where he has lived for 27 years, should have been safe – but it wasn’t. Last summer’s wildfires were among the worst on record in B.C., and consumed some of the forests around the valley. The charred land couldn’t absorb November’s heavy rains.
“It’s very easy to see global warming,” he said. “I wasn’t on the floodplain, but now it is a floodplain.”
Mr. Goetz and his wife have restored their home. They debated whether to sell it and move, but the flood brought a different kind of tragedy for his family, leaving him indifferent to the risk. During the evacuation, his daughter was in a vehicle accident while relocating her family, and his six-yearold granddaughter died. “If we had another flood, it wouldn’t matter to me,” he said. “What we lost was unimaginable.”
Two months after Merritt’s evacuation, Ms. Brown had an idea of what was required.
“There’s approximately 100 houses that will never be in a position to rebuild where they are,” she said in an interview in January.
But while these traumas are fresh, it’s hard to engage the community in the kind of conversation that Merritt’s 7,000 residents need to have about the future. City council has commissioned a study, due this summer, that will map out some options for dikes and/or retreat. Once that is done, the dialogue can start, Ms. Brown said. “It depends on the type of diking system we get engineered, to determine how many metres we need to be away from the river. In the meantime, this is creating a lot of anxiety for our citizens.”
Experts who spoke to The Globe and Mail agree on one thing: Communities that are at risk of natural disasters should be planning before a crisis hits.
In January, a report from the Expert Panel on Disaster Resilience in a Changing Climate observed that myopia gets in the way of good policy: People are reluctant to pay upfront for something that may never even happen. But the cost of preventing and preparing for disasters, they argue, is several times less than responding to and recovering from them. Especially since climate change is changing the frequency, severity and distribution of natural hazards.
Sophie Guilbault, director of partnerships at the Institute for Catastrophic Loss Reduction, said such plans should include funds to help vulnerable communities figure out whether retreat from flood risk is required. “I think we have reached a turning point. It’s very clear that these events will keep happening. So the investments that we make now will pay off – there is no doubt about that,” she said.
Armed with better floodplain maps and an understanding of the increasing danger, communities can avoid risk by banning construction in flood zones. But what to do about homes and infrastructure that are already built?
This is the challenge facing many local governments across Canada: They have inherited development in places that should never have been developed, and are under constant pressure to allow new construction where it ought not go.
“Never allowing construction on the floodplain is one thing, but reversing some of the bad decisions that were made,” Ms. Guilbault said, “it’s just something else.”
The solution is often mandatory buyouts to ensure a successful retreat, but homeowners need to be offered fair market value for their homes so that they can relocate without hardship, she added.
“You have to have the political will to make the offers appealing.”
Building bigger dikes – as Abbotsford’s city council proposed after billions of dollars worth of flood damage last November – can be an easier solution that avoids unhappy voters and the loss of taxable properties.
Human nature is a tough hurdle to clear, says Kees Lokman, a professor at the University of B.C.’s School of Architecture, and director of the UBC Coastal Adaptation Lab. “We’re stubborn, we don’t like change and we don’t want to change.”
In 2020, the Pacific Institute for Climate Solutions launched the Living with Water project under his direction. It aims to interrupt the “flood-rebuild-flood-rebuild” cycles seen in many communities. “The problem is that when we are reacting, we are on our back heels,” he said. “You’re often on the defence. If you are pro-active, you can act with foresight.”
He suggests using different language to ease difficult conversations.
“The terminology is very, I would say, military and colonial and I think that it scares people, because ‘managed retreat’ sounds like you’re being defeated.” Talk instead about protecting each other and accommodating water, he said, and the conversation might at least begin.
Although advance planning is ideal, communities can tackle postdisaster retreat successfully, says geography professor Brent Doberstein, interim director of the University of Waterloo’s climate change programs. But it requires a lot of support for those who have been flooded out while the details are sorted.
“Think about it: You’ve just had a devastating flood to your house and now people are approaching you to offer a retreat program that’s going to take 18 months to go through. And during that time, you can’t live in your damaged house and you can’t go to a new house. So the retreat process is re-traumatizing people.”
This spring, Prof. Doberstein visited the city of Grand Forks, B.C. After a major flood in 2018, 85 per cent of residents supported managed retreat, he noted, but by the time the funding from the provincial and federal governments was approved, many homeowners changed their minds.
“There’s a window of opportunity that disasters provide, but that’s not an unlimited window. It eventually closes. So I think the time to think about retreat, unfortunately for British Columbia, is now, and it may not be possible to think in the same way two years from now.”
The community of Merritt is still in that window, where residents are confronted with a decision about their future.
This year’s spring freshet brought fears of another flood, while people living higher up the slopes of the valley worry about the return of wildfires that came dangerously close last summer.
Ms. Brown, the mayor, worries that the solutions will be difficult, especially for those who remain where they are because they can’t afford to move.
“I’m not sure what the answer is,” Ms. Brown said. “I’m kind of worried, myself, about what the answer may be.”

Full text: Vancouver city hall issued notice this week that the final step needed for a massive new housing project in a heavily trafficked neighbourhood will be deferred for at least six months.
That last-minute move to cancel the July 7 public hearing for a redevelopment of the Safeway site next to the busy Commercial and Broadway SkyTrain station – currently a one-storey building with a large parking lot – prompted angry criticism.
Critics say the move speaks to the dysfunction within council and the mayor’s lack of leadership. Some blame councillors who, they say, are afraid to take a stand on another controversial development too close to the October election.
And others say the decision is emblematic of the problem with public hearings, which have become pitched battles in Vancouver, as people view them as a kind of referendum.
In the meantime, the developer has cast the deferral as an opportunity to make the project even bigger.
A representative for the real estate trust that has been working with the city for almost a decade to develop the site said the company will now explore the possibility of more density.
“We see even greater potential for new housing – including more rental and affordable housing – at one of the busiest transit hubs in Canada,” said Donald Clow, CEO of Crombie REIT, in an e-mail statement.
“We look forward to further exploring the full potential of this one-of-a-kind, transitoriented site, by aligning with the principles of the recently approved Broadway Plan to enable the addition of more housing and more diverse housing.”
The current proposal is for three 29storey towers, two of them rental, with 93 of the 438 apartments at below-market rates. There would be another 215 ownership apartments, a grocery store and other retail and office space, a public plaza, and parking for almost 1,400 bicycles.
The July public hearing, before being cancelled and deferred to December, had attracted about 80 speakers, fairly evenly split between supporters and opponents.
Buildings at transit stations to the west on the new Broadway subway, which will extend the line that runs through that site, are being projected at 30 to 40 storeys.
Council recently approved 39 storeys for a tower at Granville and Broadway. The Commercial Drive site was excluded from the Broadway Plan.
Mr. Clow’s statement said he was “disappointed” at the decision to defer the hearing until after a new council is elected in October, but did not go beyond that, even though the move has caused consternation at city hall and among the public.
Mayor Kennedy Stewart also said he was disappointed and that he had “fought hard to get that on to the agenda.”
But, he said, various councillors’ insistence on taking up valuable meeting time with “private members’ motions,” along with recent public hearings that have attracted hundreds of speakers, have meant council simply ran out of hours to complete everything by the end of July.
Mr. Stewart said public hearings have changed and become much longer because people can now phone in instead of having to wait around to speak in person.
“That has changed the dynamics.”
In spite of that, he rebuffed suggestions that the deferral is a sign of a dysfunctional council, as some have said.
“Last year, we approved almost 9,000 units, almost double 2010. This is a hardworking council. We tried as hard as we could but we ran out of runway.”
City council always breaks for a full month in August and, from now until then, it still is hearing from the almost 300 people who signed up to support or oppose a social-housing project in Kitsilano, another 50 speaking to the city’s Vancouver Plan, and speakers on several other issues.
There is almost no time set aside for public hearings before the civic election Oct. 15 and, typically, councils don’t like to make big decisions weeks before an election.
The group of opposed residents around Commercial Drive have been vocal in their criticisms about the lack of lower-cost apartments they say the developer should have had to provide, the shadows that might be cast on homes to the north, and their fears that the condos will just be bought up by investors, not the people who need housing.
“This council is afraid,” said former Vancouver councillor George Affleck, now a political commentator and occasional radio-show host. “Afraid to make a decision.
Afraid to not get re-elected. Afraid of a strong activist neighbourhood. My advice to this council: Have some guts. Stop hiding behind rhetoric and misinformation and make a decision.”
Ken Sim, the mayoral candidate for the new ABC party, also said the deferral was a sign of failure.
“The postponement of the project’s public hearing speaks to the lack of leadership in the mayor’s office and his unwillingness to deal with the project during this term or early in the next one.”
The deferral means the proposal will go before a new council that may have a crucially different mix of opinions about new development – especially with at least one party running specifically on a too-muchdevelopment theme – in contrast to the known positions of the current councillors.

Road to reinvention: Can the looming environmental disaster of Highway 413 be turned around?

Full text: Whatever else one might think about Ontario Premier Doug Ford, there’s little doubt that his Progressive Conservatives came away from the June election with a convincing electoral mandate to press ahead with the contentious Highway 413 project. The proposal – to build a major transportation corridor that links Vaughan to Milton and traverses thousands of hectares of agricultural land in the northwestern reaches of Greater Toronto – wasn’t buried in fine print in some campaign platform document. Ford & Co.
led with it, and won a majority.
The question to my mind is this: Can a project such as 413, which reflects the assumptions and land use patterns of a very different era, be salvaged and even transformed into something less ecologically damaging and potentially even innovative?
A few important caveats: First, the federal government, which has inserted itself in the environmental assessment process, may yet reject the plan on ecological grounds. As a Toronto Star/Narwhal investigation earlier this month discovered, Ontario’s Ministry of Transportation (MTO) has itself acknowledged in internal documents that the route will cut through conservation areas and threaten several endangered species.
Second, the actual form of the proposal – which has been on MTO’s books in one form or another since the early 2000s – is still up in the air. Planning and consultation documents talk about the growing need for a corridor for truck traffic as a workaround to the congestion on the 401, and also refers, vaguely, to the creation of a “transitway” that would share the route. For all of Mr. Ford’s rhetoric, the review process is nowhere close to complete.
It’s not at all difficult to see how this thing becomes a land use disaster – a truck bypass that spurs the development of a long arc of sprawling distribution centres, such as those that now line the 401 between Brampton and Milton. Or, worse, all of that sandwiched between low-rise suburbs and malls sprouting from farmland once protected by Ontario’s Greenbelt law.
But perhaps we can think about an alternative future – one informed by a significant investment in the transit component of 413 and a new approach to fostering medium density, mixed-use development along the route that yields compact communities linked by regional transit to Brampton, Mississauga, York Region and the Guelph-KitchenerWaterloo hub.
Unthinkable?
Consider current political pressure: The Ford government has set extremely ambitious housing targets to confront real estate prices. It has also demonstrated a willingness to make multibilliondollar investments in transit. Municipal Affairs and Housing Minister Steve Clark has not been shy about using ministerial zoning orders to accelerate development approvals (some necessary, others deeply problematic). Finally, the Tories, responding to calls from organizations such as the Urban Land Institute Toronto and the Toronto Region Board of Trade, have clearly signalled an interest in promoting missing middle-type development.
In many parts of Europe, large metropolitan regions are surrounded by medium-density satellite communities linked to employment hubs with highly efficient regional transit.
We’ve had a half-hearted version of that model for two generations, in the form of the GO rail network. But unlike Europe, the stations are situated at the peripheries of places like Oshawa or Oakville, and have thus generated their own commuter-sheds and parking headaches.
Can we learn something from the shortcomings of the GO hubs in the 905?
Of course, and it’s not even necessary to look especially far afield. Last year, the Ford government approved a long-term development plan for Innisfil, south of Barrie, which will focus the build out of the town on a new GO station/hub, dubbed Orbit. Unlike the GO stations built in the 1960s and 1970s along the Lakeshore corridor, Orbit will become the central point of a compact community planned to bring sufficient density to sustain commerce, limit car use, encourage walkable communities and contain sprawl.
There’s no reason some variation of the Innisfil model couldn’t be applied in select nodes along the proposed 413 route. After all, the corridor itself will be bisected in two places by expansions or enhancements to the GO rail network, and terminate close to a third. What’s more, the corridor itself could be readily linked by light rail or bus rapid transit to the Hurontario LRT, which is expected to run from the GO Lakeshore line in southern Mississauga to an interchange with a Zum transitway planned to traverse north Brampton.
Given the skyrocketing price of gas, single-family homes and basically everything else, as well as the escalating costs of financing the municipal infrastructure needed to fit out sprawling subdivisions with basic amenities, the economic case for scaling up the Innisfil approach makes abundantly sound fiscal and commercial sense.
Young families and newcomers are looking for housing that offers more than what high-rise condos can provide, but without the crushing sticker price of a single-family home. As the Boomers and Gen X retire, employers across the region desperately need to hire people who will only earn average incomes – nurses, teachers, even land use planners – and prefer to use transit than private vehicles. Finally, local governments want the new tax assessment but don’t want the fiscal burden of building and servicing pipes and roads that extend great distances.
Ever since Dalton McGuinty’s Liberals passed the Places to Grow Act, in 2006, Queen’s Park has played an increasingly assertive role in shaping regional land use and transportation planning across the GTA and Hamilton, and even west to Kitchener-Waterloo. The Ford government, if anything, has doubled-down on that approach.
The key to improving the 413 plan lies in thinking creatively about 21st-century forms of development and transportation that are better aligned with the most fearsome challenges of our era: housing affordability, climate, mobility.
There’s no question that driving a ribbon of asphalt across the rural landscape of northwestern GTA is the wrong way to proceed.
But if the government is hell-bent on creating that corridor, as seems to be the case, it is incumbent on residents, planners and advocates for sustainable growth to contemplate a third way – one that will at least mitigate some of the impact of this piece of regional infrastructure while making key gains with other policy files.
A fairly convincing answer is taking shape south of Barrie. The Ford government would be well advised to begin thinking about applying Innisfil’s approach to prevent its 413 scheme from becoming yet another over-congested white elephant highway.

Diplomats denied access to trial of kidnapped Chinese-Canadian billionaire Xiao Jianhua

Full text: A Chinese-Canadian billionaire who was snatched in Hong Kong and taken to China five years ago finally went on trial in Shanghai on Monday amid high secrecy, with a hearing that was not publicized, and to which diplomats were denied access.
Xiao Jianhua, who was worth an estimated $4.5-billion at the time of his disappearance, led a successful life that gave him access to China’s political and business elite. But he was also dogged by accusations that he acted as an agent or facilitator for officials who wanted to make business deals without public scrutiny, something he always denied.
In January, 2017, he was allegedly kidnapped by Chinese agents and ferried across the border, where he has been under house arrest ever since.
There was no public notice of the trial from the Chinese government. A source familiar with the case told The Globe that a hearing would be held in Shanghai on Monday morning, which was subsequently confirmed by Global Affairs Canada.
Late Sunday, department spokesperson Patricia Skinner said Ottawa was “aware a trial in the case of a Canadian citizen, Mr. Xiao Jianhua, will take place on July 4, 2022.”
The Globe is not naming the source because they were not authorized to speak about the case.
Mr. Xiao’s name did not appear in any dockets for the Shanghai court Monday, and when The Globe phoned to inquire about his trial, staff demanded the name of the judge in charge before they would divulge any information. A reporter who visited the court could not find any evidence of the trial being held.
Chinese authorities barred Canadian diplomats from the closeddoor hearing. Charlotte MacLeod, a spokesperson for Global Affairs, said Canada made several requests to attend.
Details of the trial remain unclear. Global Affairs would not share further information, citing privacy concerns.
Last month, the Wall Street Journal reported that Mr. Xiao’s trial was imminent, citing “people familiar with the matter.”
“After five years of quietly waiting, our family is still, based on my brother’s strict instructions, putting faith in the Chinese government and Chinese law. We hope the authorities can give our family an acceptable conclusion,” Mr. Xiao’s elder brother, Xiao Xinhua, told the Journal, adding that the case was “very complicated and full of drama.”
It is understood that prosecutors planned to charge Mr. Xiao with illegally collecting deposits, a charge the Journal said has previously been “levelled against individuals accused of selling real estate or raising funds for investment from regular people under false pretenses or without the proper licenses.”
If charged with that offence, Mr. Xiao could face a sentence of five years or more in prison, though it is unclear whether or how his years of house arrest would be taken into account.
There would be little doubt about the verdict, however, as more than 99 per cent of cases in China end in conviction.
Since his arrest, Canadian diplomats have not been able to meet with Mr. Xiao, a naturalized Canadian citizen. Speaking to The Globe earlier this year, former ambassador to China Guy Saint-Jacques said Beijing “has stonewalled all requests for consular access.”
Born in 1972 to a middle-class family, Mr. Xiao was a child prodigy, earning a scholarship at 15 to study law at Peking University, which is where he met his wife, Zhou Hongwen.
After the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, Mr. Xiao abandoned plans to go into politics, choosing instead to focus on business and becoming a devotee of Warren Buffett.
When Chinese President Xi Jinping began a much-vaunted anti-corruption campaign, Mr. Xiao gradually reduced the amount of time he spent in mainland China, choosing instead to operate primarily out of a luxury apartment in Hong Kong, where he was occasionally the focus of local paparazzi.
Starting in the early 2000s, his wife and sister-in-law developed extensive business interests in Canada, buying numerous properties in Toronto. Mr. Xiao eventually followed them in acquiring Canadian citizenship, and in 2015 he also became ambassador-atlarge for Antigua and Barbuda, advising the Caribbean country on trade issues.
China does not recognize dual citizenship, however, and in the end neither of Mr. Xiao’s foreign passports could protect him.
Just after 1 a.m. on Jan. 27, 2017, a team of plainclothes agents working for the Chinese government entered Mr. Xiao’s apartment in Hong Kong. Two hours later, they emerged, pushing Mr. Xiao in a wheelchair to a waiting vehicle, which spirited him across the border.
His kidnapping sparked outrage in Hong Kong and Canada and wild speculation about why Chinese agents took such an extreme measure. Mr. Xiao has not been heard from since that day in 2017, even as authorities have gradually dismantled his former empire, selling off assets and nationalizing companies linked to the financier’s Tomorrow Group.

Full text: DONE DEAL 33 Cottonwood Dr., Charlottetown, PEI WEST ROYALTY Asking price: $538,000 (April, 2022) Previous asking price: $538,000 (November 2021) Selling price: $528,000 (April, 2022) Previous selling price: $183,000 (August, 2007) Taxes: $3,370 (2021) Days on the market: One Listing agent: Kelly Lantz, Century 21 Colonial Realty Inc.
THE ACTION This two-storey, Cape Cod-style home is in a desirable neighbourhood of Charlottetown, less than five kilometers from the downtown core, near major retail outlets and the main campus of the University of PEI.
But timing is everything and this house – when listed first last November – had the worst, hitting a COVID lockdown, a holiday market lull and wicked winter storms. The result was only about 10 visits by potential buyers and one lone low bid over two months.
“We originally listed this home in early November, but the market had cooled quite a bit by the late fall,” agent Kelly Lantz said.
“A hard COVID lockdown by the provincial government – along with some winter storms and the Christmas holiday in December – resulted in very few home sales, so we took this house off the market.”
Reintroduced to the market in April, requests for showings nearly doubled, and a local buyer who had visited last fall wrote an offer on Day 1.
“The number of new listings on the Island in April – at 265 – was down more than 17 per cent from April, 2021,” Ms. Lantz said.
“Things in Charlottetown have been moving so quickly, so people are motivated when a new listing comes on in the spring.”
WHAT THEY GOT This three-bedroom house was built in 1975 and has 1,785 square feet of living space, plus a basement and an attached garage.
The home has an open-concept kitchen with granite countertops, and a family room with a propane fireplace. There is a patio door to the large, fully fenced backyard on the 0.282-acre lot.
There are also formal dining and living rooms.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “It’s in a nice, family-friendly neighbourhood with big lots and it’s in a good school zone,” Ms. Lantz said.
“The vibrant food scene, plenty of cultural attractions, worldclass golfing, and miles of gorgeous beaches within about a 20minute drive from Charlottetown are making our provincial capital a hot spot for home sales.”

Full text: 33 Cottonwood Dr., Charlottetown, PEI W EST ROYALTY Asking price: $538,000 (April, 2022) Previous asking price: $538,000 (November 2021) Selling price: $528,000 (April, 2022) Previous selling price: $183,000 (August, 2007) Taxes: $3,370 (2021) Days on the market: One Listing agent: Kelly Lantz, Century 21 Colonial Realty Inc.
THE ACTION This two-storey, Cape Cod-style home is in a desirable neighbourhood of Charlottetown, less than five kilometers from the downtown core, near major retail outlets and the main campus of the University of PEI.
But timing is everything and this house – when listed first last November – had the worst, hitting a COVID lockdown, a holiday market lull and wicked winter storms. The result was only about 10 visits by potential buyers and one lone low bid over two months.
“We originally listed this home in early November, but the market had cooled quite a bit by the late fall,” agent Kelly Lantz said.
“A hard COVID lockdown by the provincial government – along with some winter storms and the Christmas holiday in December – resulted in very few home sales, so we took this house off the market.”
Reintroduced to the market in April, requests for showings nearly doubled, and a local buyer who had visited last fall wrote an offer on Day 1.

Digital hearings leave tenants behind, group says: Ontario renters advocacy centre fears push toward holding online tribunals fails to account for people who aren’t tech-savvy

Full text: THE LISTING
Legal clinics that support renters have banded together to file human rights complaints against Ontario’s Landlord and Tenant Board alleging its “digital first” strategy has discriminated against tenants based on age, family status and disability.
For the first time in its history, the Advocacy Centre for Tenants Ontario is bringing applications to the Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario against the LTB and its parent organization, Tribunals Ontario, that call into question the entire method of holding hearings, alleging that “digital first” has created systemic discrimination that puts Ontarians’ human rights last.
“When you do a single system with a service delivery mode that’s digital, there’s a generation of people that didn’t grow up with computers,” said Mairghread Knought, a community legal worker with the Nipissing Community Legal Clinic who has attempted to help people from all over the province who have struggled to have their cases heard in the often chaotic online hearings. “Putting a justice system online where housing is at stake – this isn’t renewing your licence – there’s a customer service aspect really missing here.”
At issue is a decision made in 2020 by Tribunals Ontario and the LTB to no longer hold hearings in person and focus on doing its work online or over the telephone. Officially, in-person hearings remained possible, but examples of it happening were virtually non-existent until recent months. Initially the move was said to be necessitated by pandemic restrictions, but even as other courts have opened up and begun taking in-person hearings, the LTB has signalled its intent to stay “digital first” for good.
ACTO’s lead lawyer on the file said that the Tribunal’s attempts to prioritize speed have not only failed to eliminated massive backlogs and wait times for hearings, but have been detrimental to a large group of tenants.
“No one can deny it works for a lot of people, and for some people it might be better than before,” said Ryan Hardy, staff lawyer at ACTO, referring mainly to landlords seeking evictions.
“Clearly if you sacrifice procedural protections, or sacrifice access to duty council, and sacrifice a lot of the rules of evidence, I’ve seen an application for an eviction disposed of in under two minutes.
“If you do that it’s probably more mathematically efficient, but at what cost? How many people got evicted who might not have been evicted under a fairer system?” Lorraine Peever, 77, is the complainant in one of the first HRTO cases ACTO is bringing. In 2019, she tried to file a tenants application for compensation after her building – a District of Nipissing Housing Services seniors residence in North Bay with 106 apartments – was infested with bed bugs.
“I had to put on extra pants, and tuck the pants inside the socks. My arms were bitten; I put extra-long socks on my arms, a sweater. I had a towel around my neck, a fancy scarf on my head: That’s how I went to bed,” said Ms. Peever. As the bug issues continued to plague the building well into 2020, Ms. Peever grew increasingly irate at the costs borne by her and other tenants.
At one point she was told to put everything she wanted to save in three plastic boxes, which meant throwing away almost everything else, including gowns she had for dancing. But on several occasions she was unable to join the new all-digital hearings on her phone.
“The things going on in this building are not right. I was getting fed up. It bothered me really, really bad,” said Ms. Peever, who eventually contacted her local legal clinic for help. “We’re all seniors and nobody wants to talk up or nothing … we’re not all bright and have computers.”
Ms. Knought’s office has fought twice now to get Ms. Peever’s case heard. Ms. Peever is still waiting to find out whether the LTB will hear her application. She missed her most recent hearing after being badly injured in a winter storm, ending up in a rehabilitation hospital with three broken vertebrae.
“No one wants to have to do a human rights complaint,” said Ms. Knought. “It’s sad that no one seems to be listening.” ACTO runs the provincially funded Tenant Duty Counsel program that puts a trained lawyer in every hearing room – once physical, now all digital – to advise tenants who are allowed to represent themselves at the Tribunal but often need guidance on how to do so.
Ms. Knought has worked with the legal clinic on and off for two decades and has advised tenants in hundreds of digital hearings since COVID-19 began.
“It was a Band-Aid solution and it hasn’t been done well,” said Ms. Knought. “What we see is individuals who struggle with mute and unmute.”
In Northern Ontario, in-person hearings were rare prepandemic, she said; about twice a month the Tribunal would set up temporary shop in a Best Western hotel, but at least tenants had a chance to be heard. “This is the worst I’ve ever seen it. … I’ve never worked anywhere where the ability to communicate with a government body has been so bad.”
Even though the LTB has hired more adjudicators in recent months and scheduled more hearings, Ms. Knought said there are more adjournments than ever – and even if there is a hearing, the relative inexperience of many of the new adjudicators means there have been lengthening delays in getting written verdicts.
“The Attorney-General must ensure the LTB’s digital hearings are fast, fair and easy to use for all, and guarantee an in-person hearing if a tenant or landlord requests one,” said Jessica Bell, NDP MPP and critic on the housing file, who has spoken out for months about service problems at the LTB.
Tribunals Ontario did not respond to a request for comment.
“I’m hoping the government will wake up,” Ms. Peever said.
“It’s been dragging on and nothing’s been settled.”

An Oshawa home with water at its heart: Expert in green infrastructure takes her home to the next level

Full text: 154 Glenwood Cres.
OSHAWA , ONT.
Asking Price: $1,199,999 Taxes: $5,806.10 (2022) Lot Size: 62.5 by 120 feet Lisitng agent: Pino Bruni, Re/Max Jazz Inc.
THE BACKSTORY As you walk up the driveway of 154 Glenwood Cres., it may not be apparent that under your feet is a bit of landscape and ecological technology central to the owner’s life.
“We broke up the long driveway with concrete inserts to reduce rain runoff, and it slopes right toward the west side of the house, so we put a rain garden along the west that takes all the water,” said Tracy Patterson, one of the principals of a water management solutions business that works with conservation areas, municipalities and businesses to address the increasingly vital issue of mitigating extreme weather events. “I deal with a lot of run-off issues, and driveways are this huge source.
… So many of our storm sewers go right to creeks. So you can imagine the crap that gets moved downstream.” In addition to thirsty and hardy plants to absorb that runoff, the landscaping is also full of pollinator plantings that support local bee populations.
Ms. Patterson initially wanted a career in zoology, but ended up being drawn to work aimed at protecting the ecosystem, which is increasingly a pursuit of using “green infrastructure” to protect humans from the flooding and drought conditions wrought by climate change.
A shift in her profession has seen a growing appreciation of the vital role the natural landscape plays in managing water systems, so much so that it can be cheaper and more effective to go natural than to rely on man-made engineering systems like pipes and reservoirs. “Instead of looking at a forest and saying it’s just a forest, or a wetland and saying it’s just a wetland we see there’s an incentive to protect those natural parts of the watershed that represent a huge cost savings function let alone a risk mitigation,” she said.
And when it came to the renovation of her 1950s vintage Oshawa split-level home, she and her partner applied the same notion when adapting the mid-century structure to wring the most benefit from the natural environment.
THE HOUSE TODAY When Ms. Patterson bought the house a decade ago with her partner Marcus Adrian McDowell it wasn’t exactly a dream fulfilled.
“I’m not a suburbia person; it was hard sell for me,” said Ms. Patterson who came to the house from downtown Toronto. On the other extreme, her mother lived in rural Uxbridge – “That was pure country” – and the in-between space of the suburbs didn’t call to her. Until she got to Glenwood.
“That pocket is known as the Glens, or the North Glens, and it’s one of the most sought-after destinations in Oshawa,” said listing agent Pino Bruni.
“When we drove down the street I looked at all these huge trees, this house at the top of the hill, across from a big park with giant spruces, and down the hill the ravine. … You just get a sense,” Ms. Patterson said. “Maybe I had an idea of suburbia that has since been disproven; it’s nice when it’s dark at night and quiet.”
Less nice were some of the interior finishes, which had barely been updated since the house was built and were suffering from wear and tear and dated style: “One bathroom was completely lime-green and black,” Ms. Patterson said.
“We didn’t have a large budget so we read a ton about mid-century modern design, so we did drawings on graph paper,” she said.
When their sketches got too complex out came the pencil crayons to help define their ideas. “It was a slow process, my partner is a musician and so he’s very artistic and creative, and he came up with great stuff.”
One of the first things they did was redefine the entryway by closing in a vestibule, a project that also uncovered a 10-footsquare unused void behind a wall that was ripped away, space that was added to a main-floor bathroom.
The house is split over four levels and the stairs to the upper-level bedrooms are just to the left of the entrance, while directly ahead is the kitchen. On the right is a brick wall that doubles as a chimney for the fireplace that anchors the sitting room on the right side of the hall, which shares that half of the floor with a formal dining space that also connects to the kitchen.
The environmental theme is continued with new flooring throughout that is Forest Stewardship Council certified sustainably harvested, and small three-inch energy efficient LED lighting.
There’s a half-wall with three long rectangular cut-outs that separates the kitchen from the dining space, and those cut-outs are a motif that will appear again and again.
The dining room has a long rectangular window about three-quarters of the way up that lets in light while offering nosy neighbours no views of dinner, and that window form will also repeat throughout the house. Even the kitchen has big windows, but they are wider than they are tall.
“We looked at mid-century styles, and prairie style homes, and they really do have a horizontal feel,” said Ms. Patterson, referring to Frank Lloyd Wright’s turn of the 20th-century designs such as the famous Robie House, which features those high, narrow windows. The original Glenwood house did not have much in the way of internal connections, split as it is by multiple staircases. So in several spots, the couple simple cut more rectangles through walls to create openings between floors. “It has this linear feel, so let’s go with it … we wanted light from the windows to come through all the different areas,” she said.
There’s a hole cut at floor level in the kitchen that looks through a glassed-in gas fireplace to a living room below. Taking the stairs down to this room from the kitchen the supporting wall has more rectangles cut into it, and on the same wall as the fireplace window is another window cut into the wall again to draw light into the lowest level of the house (down another set of stairs).
This basement room has another wallmounted gas fireplace, next to a wallmounted television. The rear wall of this space is filled with cabinets for storage.
Upstairs the couple pushed the ceilings up to the dormers to expose the roof rafters, giving the space yet more light and height. The three bedrooms all have their own unique decor as well.
FAVOURITE SPACE The garden room: That’s what Ms. Patterson calls the level just below the kitchen, which has a dry-bar with wine fridge, a seating area that faces double glass doors that walk out onto the patio and rear yard. Behind this living space is the laundry area and another guest bathroom.
“I love having coffee there,” thanks to the view into the wooded garden, and a sense of solitude and connection to nature the high windows offer elsewhere. “My partner likes the basement. He clicks a fire on, gets his guitar and he likes to hang out with this musician friends. They are down there, and they can do their thing and I can go do mine,” she said.
Some mid-century homes are long, low places with wide open living spaces, whereas a split level has a more chopped up layout. Ms. Patterson and Mr. McDowell’s pencil-coloured sketches imagined connecting those spaces with cut-outs while leaving them separated enough to program differently. For them, it’s the best of both worlds.

Full text: 26 Shannon St., Toronto TRINITY BELLWOODS Asking price: $1,890,000 (May, 2022) Selling price: $2.25-million (May, 2022) Taxes: $6,593 (2021) Days on the market: Two Listing agent: Jen Tripp, HomeLife/Realty One Ltd.
THE ACTION Agent Jen Tripp was busy uploading this threestorey Victorian to a multiple listing service site when a colleague volunteered to install the lockbox for potential buyers. While he was there, he took along a client, who jumped at presenting the first bid.
“I said, ‘We’re not taking bully offers,’ ” Ms. Tripp said.
“But he said, ‘You’ll take this bully.’ ” While five local contractors rushed over to take a look at the property, the first bidder hiked their offer to $2.25-million, shutting out the competition.
“There were four other properties I was watching that were just sitting, so I thought we missed the market and opportunity,” Ms. Tripp said. “But we exceeded expectations.”
“There’s something about having an opportunity to buy before anybody else; buyers feel like they’re making a more clean decision. Whereas, if you’re buying it in competition, you’re constantly thinking about what the other guy is going to do.”
WHAT THEY GOT This heritage-designated house is more than 100 years old and has a brick façade and stained-glass windows. The roof and wiring were replaced recently, and interiors finishes were updated in the 1970s.
There are formal dining and living rooms, a total of three bathrooms and recreation space in the basement.
On the upper floors are a den and five bedrooms.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “Shannon is a street lined with great, big, old Victorians, and probably half of them have been renovated,” Ms. Tripp said. “Neighbouring properties have sold for $4-million.”
“Other than replacing the bathrooms and kitchen floors, you didn’t have to move interior walls because the floor plan was good and the hallways were wide, so you just had to bring in a new colour palette.”
A double garage on the 25- by 121-foot lot was also a prized asset. “You can put in a big, laneway house,” Ms. Tripp said.

Blackstone says it will not target single-family homes in its Canadian expansion

Full text: Blackstone Inc. said Monday it has no interest in investing in single-family homes in Canada, laying to rest speculation the giant global asset manager would scoop up hundreds of Canadian houses and turn them into rental properties.
After Blackstone announced plans in May to establish a Canadian office in Toronto, rumours abounded that the private equity firm would unleash its firepower, gobble up homes and increase competition for individuals and families looking to buy homes.
The typical home price across the country has climbed 50 per cent over the past two years and real estate investors have come under scrutiny for their role in ramping up competition and driving up prices.
But Blackstone’s head of real estate Americas, Nadeem Meghji, said that is not in the cards for the company’s Canadian expansion.
“It’s just not an area that we are focused on in Canada,” he said in a joint interview with Janice Lin, the new head of Blackstone Canada.
The New York-based company, which has US$915.5-billion in assets under management, has been accused of profiting off the 2007 U.S. housing meltdown after it bought swaths of distressed properties and then rented them out to U.S. residents.
Blackstone has said it did not own any single-family homes before the crisis and didn’t foreclose on any of the properties. It has also said many of its purchases were homes that had been sitting vacant and dragging down local property values.
Blackstone has since sold that business and owns a rent-to-own business called Home Partners of America – one of the many players in a growing single-family home rental market in the U.S.
“We don’t have a similar platform in Canada and we don’t have the intention of launching one because, from our perspective, we think there are just more interesting places to deploy capital in the Canadian market,” Mr. Meghji said.
Ms. Lin, a former Canada Pension Plan Investment Board executive, is in charge of Blackstone’s expansion in Canada. She cited the country’s favourable immigration policies and its strong population growth as two key factors that make Canada a winner for Blackstone’s capital.
Blackstone mostly owns warehouses and other industrial space in Canada, as well as a couple of office towers. It also has some investments in apartment building developments. All together, they are worth about US$14-billion, according to Blackstone, representing just a tiny fraction of the company’s global real estate portfolio.
Ms. Lin and Mr. Meghji both said the company will continue to invest in industrial and top office buildings, as well as hotels.
Blackstone has previously said it expects its growth here will be significant. Mr. Meghji would not quantify “significant” except to say he expects growth will be material and Canada could eventually command a larger share of Blackstone’s global real estate portfolio.

BLACKSTOCK
Asking price: $749,900 (March, 2022) Selling price: $1,008,000 (April, 2022) Previous selling price: $225,000 (May, 2011) Taxes: $3,304 (2021) Days on the market: Six Listing agent: Alaina Malcolm, Coldwell Banker – R.M.R. Real Estate
THE ACTION For a brief period this spring, this updated bungalow was the only property for sale in Blackstock, a small town near Lake Scugog about 90 kilometres east of Toronto. About 40 potential buyers asked for a private tour and about a quarter of those made purchase offers.
“Blackstock is a sought-after area, being just outside Port Perry, and people are always looking for bungalows,” said local agent Alaina Malcolm.
“So we didn’t expect nine offers, but we knew there would be multiple offers.”
WHAT THEY GOT This three-bedroom house with an attached garage was built on a 66- by 132-foot lot about 60 years ago. Over the past 10 years, the roofing and windows were replaced, and the interiors were remodelled with open living and dining areas.
The kitchen was revamped with granite countertops and a centre island.
A rear laundry room also provides access to a back deck and the lower level, which has an office, guest bedroom, recreation room and a second full bathroom.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “Blackstock is an older town without a lot of new builds,” Ms. Malcolm said. “This house was built around 1960, but it was all redone and open concept.”
“There’s a school right behind the house that the back yard backs onto, so I thought we’d see more young families as there are a lot of rooms,” she said. “But we had some [buyers] from the city and a lot from around Port Perry.
The buyers ended up being semiretired.”

West Vancouver highlights issues driving housing crisis: To understand why new homes aren’t being approved for development, look no further than council meetings

Full text: Former journalist with BBC News for 21 years, now an active volunteer and a director of Positive Voices, a community advocacy group in West Vancouver B arely a day goes by without a politician promising that they are trying to fix the housing crisis. They’re working on all the angles: increasing supply, tempering demand and helping first-time buyers get financing.
In Canada, municipal or local government is responsible for land-use planning, zoning and authorizing development, after community consultation.
What’s happening in my community of West Vancouver exemplifies some of the problems local governments have when it comes to negotiating a path between residents – who may be motivated by NIMBYism – and the broader public interest.
One of the richest municipalities in Canada, “West Van” has a reputation as a posh suburb. But its stark disparities are less wellknown.
West Van is a beautiful place, and my family and I feel privileged to live here. With the North Shore mountains behind us, we are warmed by the sun as we look south at the Vancouver cityscape across the water. Unlike other parts of the region, we have no industry blighting our coastline.
In turn, West Vancouver depends almost entirely on property taxes to pay for services. That lack of an industrial tax base led to a financial crunch as far back as the 1950s. Municipal leaders responded by rezoning 50 acres of prime, waterfront land at Ambleside for high-rise apartments.
This sparked a vigorous anti-development backlash that has dominated local debate and the agendas of many residents’ association meetings ever since.
No wonder that today 90 per cent of West Van remains zoned for single-family homes (SFH).
The district’s geography and exclusive reputation has been energetically fanned by realtors.
Compounded by two recent home-price spikes, we’re now left with an average house price of $3million. Home ownership is beyond the reach of most, certainly the middle classes. And rental?
That’s been in very short supply for at least 20 years.
The result is that three-quarters of the people who work in West Van don’t live here, according to estimates by the district.
Only 9 per cent of our municipal staff – including firefighters, police officers, bus drivers and librarians – live in the community.
Among major employers, fewer than 10 per cent of workers with BC Ferries’ Horseshoe Bay terminal in the west and less than a quarter of public-school teachers live in West Van, according to figures I received from the district.
All these commuters, of course, create congestion and greenhouse gas emissions.
The lack of affordable options also exacerbates problems for many existing residents. A 2020 district housing-needs report found that 30 per cent of homeowners live in dwellings considered unsuitable, inadequate or unaffordable. That figure is 60 per cent for renters. The report adds that seniors “are struggling to remain in the community as they age” and there are no housing or shelter beds for the homeless.
Census data show there has been a drop in the proportion of young families living in West Van.
There are fewer children here now than there were in 2001, even as the district’s overall population has grown by 6.5 per cent.
So what is West Van doing in response to this demographic challenge and the lack of affordable housing?
Local business, community and political leaders have for years declaimed that there is insufficient housing diversity in West Van, particularly accommodation at different price points.
The Official Community Plan (OCP) – a blueprint for the community’s growth and development that forms a key plank in the municipal planning process – was most recently updated in 2018.
Approved after four phases of community engagement, 100 events and more than a thousand surveys and public submissions, the OCP called for a big expansion of the “missing middle” – alternatives to single-family homes and apartments.
According to the district’s plan, that missing middle could take the form of “sensitive infill,” which preserves the character of existing single-family-home neighbourhoods, with smaller houses on smaller lots, coach (or laneway) houses and duplexes.
Triplex, townhouse and mixeduse buildings would be located close to transit and amenities.
The OCP called for 5,000 new housing units to be built by 2041, or an average of 217 a year. The mayor and council’s strategic plan, updated late last year, is even more ambitious: targeting 250 new units a year.
Yet, in the past four years, just 501 new housing units have been approved – little more than half of what was called for in the OCP.
Nearly all are apartments. Of the much talked-about “missing middle”: six coach-houses, five duplexes and seven “infill” detached housing got the green light, but no townhouses or multiplexes.
So why isn’t housing, affordable or otherwise, being approved?
The answer rests in the council meetings where development proposals live or die.
Take, for instance, the outcome of one recent project. A developer, Onni, applied to the district to add more rental units to an already-approved apartment complex. The building forms part of the 21-acre multiphase Evelyn Drive project, whose master plan was greenlighted back in 2007. After extensive discussions with the district’s planning department, Onni asked council for permission to add 109 more units, of which 17 would be offered at below-market rents.
Mayor Mary-Ann Booth, who supported the plan, implored councillors to take heed of widespread frustration with local government. “When the whole country is saying we have a housing crisis, municipalities are tinkering, what they see as dawdling, and not meeting the needs of their own communities,” she said.
The proposal was defeated by a 4-3 vote. It was the latest instance of development permits and rezoning applications rejected by the same four councillors.
The reasons given here, as with many previous applications: the project would interfere with sightlines for nearby residents; there wasn’t enough community consultation; and it would exacerbate traffic congestion.
Peter Lambur is a councillor who voted against the proposal, one of a dozen housing development projects he has voted against since 2018. When I asked why he’d opposed the application, he said it didn’t comply with the OCP, which he considers incomplete until Local Area Plans (LAP) are developed. LAPs are neighbourhood or village-level plans that supplement the broad outlines framed by the OCP, adding more detailed communitylevel guidance on the look, feel and function of future development. They take two to three years to complete, after extensive community consultation.
Mr. Lambur argues that LAPs offer the clearest vision of the community’s wishes, even if completing them delays the development process. He says he believes concerns about a lack of housing projects being approved by council are overstated. “The [real estate] industry, for their part, has been pretty successful in pushing the narrative of a housing crisis,” he tells me. “We have plenty of opportunities and projects to pick from.”
But there is a clear tension between Mr. Lambur’s approach and the sense of urgency that some other councillors say is required to meet the community’s housing needs.
The problem, Councillor Craig Cameron tells me, is that councillors who vote against current proposals point to developments nearing completion to say everything is fine, ignoring that most of those projects took years to come to fruition.
A strong advocate for expanding housing, Mr. Cameron says there’s been minimal progress during the current council’s term.
“There’s a whole number of projects that never came forward because the proponents knew they weren’t going to get a sympathetic or even neutral consideration,” he says. He argues that opponents have been using “process” arguments to stall or reject projects, and placate a vocal minority.
But there are risks when municipal councils pay more attention to anti-development residents than the long-term interests of the community, he says.
Mr. Cameron says he believes it’s inevitable that the power to approve development will eventually be taken away from local governments.
Citing blockages in the municipal housing approvals pipeline, senior levels of governments are starting to look at mechanisms to speed up things.
B.C.’s Housing Minister David Eby has said that the province was considering legislation to override municipalities’ planning decisions. “[Residents] are engaged in a Hunger Games-style struggle with others who are already having trouble finding a place to live here,” he told the CBC in February.
And in its April budget, the federal government proffered a carrot, rather than a stick, to municipalities: $4-billion to incentivize faster development.
Local officials have a duty to not only reflect residents’ concerns, but also challenge them, Andy Yan, director of Simon Fraser University’s City Program tells me. While it’s important to acknowledge people’s fear of change, “there are consequences of no change as much as rapid change,” he says.
I put some of these thoughts to Heather Mersey, president of West Van’s most influential residents’ group – the Ambleside and Dundarave Residents Association (ADRA). She says the board is non-partisan and meets regularly with councillors to discuss housing issues.
Members’ overriding concern is maintaining the village-like character of West Van’s neighbourhoods, she tells me. She also points to high levels of immigration – targets set by the federal government – and argues that municipalities don’t have the resources to provide housing and services to hundreds of thousands of new residents. And, she says, it doesn’t make sense to increase housing density to address that need in a place with very high land values, such as West Van.
Beyond immigration, I ask Ms. Mersey how West Van can meet the housing needs of existing residents and its local work force: teachers, police officers, first-time buyers and seniors needing to downsize, for whom we might feel a sense of responsibility. “It’s a complex question …” she says.
“I don’t have a magic solution.”
I ask about ADRA’s reputation among some in the community – it’s mockingly known as the AntiDevelopment Resident’s Association. Ms. Mersey says it’s a convenient misrepresentation.
“If you’re going to have a scoreboard with developers versus residents’ groups, I think you’d see developers winning most of the time,” she says.
B.C. is heading into municipal elections in October and arguments over housing density and affordability – never far from people’s minds – are likely to dominate once again.
Senior levels of government concerned about the lack of movement in creating housing supply should keep an eye on what’s happening in races for council in communities such as West Van, which are ultimately where Canada’s housing crisis will be solved.

Full text: 111 Strathallan Blvd., Toronto LYTTON PAR K Asking price: $4,295,000 (April, 2022) Selling price: $4,650,000 (April, 2022) Previous selling price: $840,000 (March, 1999) Taxes: $13,833 (2021) Days on the market: One Listing agents: Carol Lome and Brayden Irwin, Royal LePage Real Estate Services Ltd., Johnston and Daniel Division THE ACTION This five-bedroom house near the North Toronto Tennis Club and John Ross Robertson Junior Public School had about a dozen buyers drop by on its first day on the market. Two offers came in before the date set to review offers. The sellers accepted an offer that added $355,000 to their $4.295-million asking price.
“We priced it competitively with what was available on the market,” agent Carol Lome said.
“This property was better than one [the buyers] tried to buy a week earlier, so they did not want to miss out on this one.”
WHAT THEY GOT This three-storey house from the 1920s has a classic centre-hall plan with a central foyer and formal living and dining rooms with bay windows.
The house sits on a 50- by 135-foot lot and has been recently renovated and expanded, creating 3,258 square feet of modern living space, including five bathrooms and recreation rooms on the main and second levels.
The updated eat-in kitchen is outfitted with stainless-steel appliances. There’s also a wine cellar in the basement.
At the back of the house is a stone patio and in-ground pool.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “It’s a very pretty Georgian house and the landscaping was rejuvenated a few years ago,” Ms. Lome said.
“They had an older pool, which tends to be deeper and larger than newer pools, so it was the full width of the property.”
The tree-lined street and local amenities were also coveted.
“Lytton Park – because of the schools and neighbourhood feel – is very much in demand,” Ms. Lome said.
“Strathallan is also a premium street west of Avenue Road, and originally it was the extension of Alexandra Boulevard.”

Wholesaler Faire opening Toronto office: Company joins others in betting on city’s talent and real estate at a time when tech sector is on shaky footing

Full text: When the co-founders of Faire Wholesale Inc. met to pitch the startup accelerator Y Combinator in Silicon Valley in 2016, one of them wasn’t there. As the team made a case for building an AIpowered marketplace to connect local retailers with the right merchandise wholesalers, chief technology officer Marcelo Cortes was beamed in on a Google Hangouts video.
This sort of thing didn’t happen so often before the COVID-19 pandemic, but Mr. Cortes was home in Canada’s Waterloo, Ont., region – where he’d already worked on the former social network Google+ and built out a team that helped launch Square Inc.’s Cash App mobile-payment service.
So Mr. Cortes was used to brushing off Silicon Valley when it beckoned. And by the time he started to put together the company Faire – then called Indigo Fair – he even joined the pitch remotely. As the company grew, so did its Kitchener, Ont., team. And as the pandemic hit, they were ready for the shift to remote collaboration. So ready, it seemed, that their growth accelerated.
The company, headquartered in San Francisco but with Mr. Cortes leading a team of nearly 250 staff of mostly engineers in the Kitchener-Waterloo region, was most recently valued at nearly US$12.6-billion. The company is now investing further in Canada, announcing a new downtown Toronto office Thursday with room for at least 150 staff. And its executives are confident they won’t stop there. “I just don’t know how long we’re going to be able to fit,” Mr. Cortes said of the new office.
Faire is joining the ranks of companies such as cloud-computing giant Snowflake Inc. to bet on both Toronto real estate and talent at a moment when the sector is on shaky footing. Even as they face the dual headwinds of a tech-market correction and retailers’ fears of an inflation-driven spending pullback, Faire’s cofounders are confident in their expansion.
Jeffrey Kolovson, the cofounding chief operating officer, pointed to the latest in Faire’s steady stream of financing: US$416-million just a month ago.
The company, Mr. Kolovson said, has been “probably a little lucky with the timing” of it all.
Mr. Cortes arrived in Canada from Brazil in 2001, hoping to learn English before looking for work in the United States. Instead, he fell in love with both the country and his future wife.
After working for a few small companies and studying at the University of Waterloo, he joined Google as a senior engineer at its local office, working on an Android app for Google+. When he later joined the payments platform Square – now called Block – in 2013, he established its Canadian office and treated its nascent Cash App like its own startup within the company.
He and several of the San Franciscans he worked with – Max Rhodes, Daniele Perito and Mr. Kolovson – spent the next few years talking about launching a company. Mr. Rhodes had started an umbrella business in his younger days, hoping to distribute products to mom-and-pop shops, but had been astounded at how difficult it was to connect with them. Eventually, the Square almuni decided to build a company that would address that problem by making it easier to connect brands with retailers.
“We understood how the market was in the dark of technology, like the way those retailers and brands were meeting … was completely outdated, inefficient and expensive,” Mr. Cortes said.
“Both sides had to travel to a trade show.”
First launching out of Y Combinator, the venerated startup accelerator, they began to build a marketplace to make the whole process easier. They focused on gifts – such as greeting cards, candles and home decor – and curated a list of brands they believed would have a high success of selling at independent retailers.
They enacted a try-before-youbuy policy, hoping to free retailers of the costly consequences of blindly buying new products in bulk.
And they began to develop artificial-intelligence algorithms to attempt matching shops with products that would sell well there, based in part on data provided by the retailers. To generate revenue, the company charged brands commissions on their orders.
Kirsten Green, the founder and managing partner of San Francisco’s commerce-focused Forerunner Ventures, had spent several years hunting for companies that would disrupt conventional retail-wholesale trade shows when she came across Faire just a few months into its existence.
Other marketplace businesses, she said in an interview, “weren’t fleshed out.” But with Faire, “I immediately saw that this team recognized the opportunity to create a bundled offering to make the whole proposition more compelling for both parties. … Their original vision is very much what they’re executing to today.”
The growth was rapid. By October, 2019, Faire was valued at US$1-billion after U.S.-based Lightspeed Venture Partners and Peter Thiel’s Founders Fund joined Forerunner in a US$150million financing round. And when the pandemic hit months later, Faire was already well positioned for a world in which remote work became normal.
“We were fully set up for it,” Mr. Cortes said. “We had Zoom everywhere.” And it helped that in a world without trade shows, digital marketplaces only gained more appeal. “COVID forced them to adopt technology faster,” the co-founder continued.
Faire’s value has jumped a dozen-fold since then, as it offers goods from 70,000 brands to a network of half-a-million retailers across North America and Europe – though it’s hard to tell how the sector’s rocky past month has treated that valuation. The most recent US$416million financing, Mr. Kolovson said, “is a good vote of confidence from our investors in how the business is performing and what they think will happen going forward.”
The company hired dozens of Toronto staff during the pandemic, and while remote work remains at a reality for many people on many days, the soon-tobe-official local hub on Wellington Street West may soon surpass Faire’s London office as its thirdbiggest.

Full text: In the weeks after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, British lawmakers revived and rushed through a long-delayed economic crime bill to target Russian assets, President Joe Biden said the United States was “coming for your illbegotten gains,” and authorities in France and Italy seized yachts linked to Kremlin allies.
As Western governments crack down on dirty money – or at least make a show of doing so – the world’s kleptocrats and oligarchs are looking for new places to store their wealth.
“In the last few months, there’s been an incredible rerouting of capital to new places where people can stash their money,” said Tom Mayne, an expert in corruption studies at the London-based think tank Chatham House.
“Hong Kong is a great destination for these oligarchs.”
While the former British colony – and pioneer of offshore finance – is not the only place the suddenly displaced Russian rich are eyeing, it has an edge over rivals such as Dubai and Caribbean tax havens.
“Oligarchs have historically loved London because of what it brings to the table not just in terms of financial services, but also luxury properties and private schools for their children,” Mr. Mayne said. Hong Kong has these things in abundance.
The city has long been attractive for Chinese oligarchs, and while that has changed somewhat in recent years because of President Xi Jinping’s anticorruption crackdown and Beijing’s growing control, for those with less to fear from the Chinese government, it may be the ideal bolthole.
Beijing’s influence over Hong Kong could even be a plus for those seeking to shield their assets. The Chinese and Hong Kong governments – targets and critics of Western sanctions themselves – are disinclined to help foreign countries punish those responsible for the war in Ukraine, just as they have allegedly turned a blind eye to sanctioned North Korean entities operating here.
A spokesperson for the Hong Kong government said the city implements sanctions of the United Nations Security Council to fulfill its international obligations.
The sanctions of other jurisdictions are outside the scope of the government’s international legal duties, the spokesperson added.
David Asher, a former U.S. State Department official and sanctions expert, said there is another reason Hong Kong is an “obvious alternative” to London as a hub for oligarchs: the Clearing House Automated Transfer System (CHATS).
Set up in 2000, the part-government-owned CHATS processes billions of U.S. dollars, without the transactions necessarily touching the U.S. banking system.
During extradition proceedings in Vancouver against Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou, who was accused of breaching U.S. sanctions against Iran, two experts testified that had the transactions been processed through CHATS, the entire case might have been avoided.
“[Hong Kong bankers] quite flagrantly announce they can take your dollars and clear them in pristine bank dollars and it’ll settle without having to go through New York,” Mr. Asher said. “It’s being done by a large number of interesting and frankly disturbing individuals around the world.”
And if you need a local company to help handle some of those transactions, or to process the purchase of a luxury property, Hong Kong happens to be one of the easiest places to register a company and keep its true owners and purpose secret.
Opening a company in Hong Kong costs less than C$250 and requires just a director and a company secretary, with only the latter needing to be based in the city.
Thousands of firms offer secretarial services, and can also provide a Hong Kong address for the new company, with some offices registered to hundreds of different businesses, something the U.S.
Treasury regards as a “red flag for shell corporation activity.”
While not necessarily an indication of criminality, “we know that the majority of shell companies aren’t legitimate businesses and aren’t involved in any business activities, they’re simply used to move money around,” Mr. Mayne said.
Some Russian oligarchs have already seen the advantages of operating in Hong Kong. The United States has sanctioned entities in the city linked to Oleg Deripaska, a billionaire close to Russian President Vladimir Putin, and Yevgeny Prigozhin, an oligarch accused of funding the Internet Research Agency troll farm accused of interfering in the 2016 U.S. election, and the mercenary Wagner Group.
According to the U.S. State Department, between 2018 and 2019, three Hong Kong companies controlled by Mr. Prigozhin “facilitated more than 100 transactions exceeding $7.5-million.” Corporate records list another sanctioned individual, Igor Lavrenkov, as director of those companies, while administrative services were provided by Hong Kong Easy Secretarial Ltd., which did not respond to a request for comment. All the companies appear to have ceased operations since being sanctioned.
Mr. Deripaska is a former director of the Hong Kong-listed aluminum giant Rusal. When the company was sanctioned by the U.S.
along with other Russian entities in 2018, he was forced to step down, although he remains a major shareholder. Rusal was removed from a sanctions list the next year, but the Financial Times has reported that U.S. bankers have avoided trading in the stock, which has lost billions in value since the war in Ukraine began.
Having a company based in Hong Kong can be advantageous, because like London – and unlike tax havens such as the British Virgin Islands – its position as a global financial centre can provide a certain veneer of respectability.
On its website, Hong Kong Easy Secretarial Ltd. notes that customers “use Hong Kong’s international image and status to enhance the company’s own competitiveness.”
After the Panama Papers were published in 2016 – exposing Hong Kong as a global hub for shell companies – the city moved to beef up measures against money laundering and corporate disclosure laws. This included introducing a Significant Controllers Register, which requires companies to maintain a list of beneficial owners that must “be open for inspection by law enforcement officers upon demand,” although not the public.
A company secretary who has worked in the industry for eight years and represented hundreds of companies described the new register as a “box ticking exercise by the government.”
The Globe and Mail is not identifying the person so they can speak about sensitive matters.
“It’s good for us because we charge a fee for it, but from a regulatory perspective it’s pretty useless,” they said, pointing out that even banks can’t request to see the register, and its accuracy largely depends on the honesty of the person maintaining it.
The company secretary said that while it has got considerably tougher to open a bank account in recent years due to financial institutions’ own internal checks, people can still set up a company or buy property without much government oversight.
Under Hong Kong law, there is a statutory obligation to report any suspicion that property involved in a deal represents proceeds of an indictable offence. But statistics from Hong Kong’s Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (JFIU) show some sectors are more stringent than others in actually doing so: Of the nearly 57,000 suspicious transaction reports JFIU received last year, the vast majority – more than 80 per cent – were submitted by banks.
Just 860 reports, 1.5 per cent of the total, were filed by real estate agencies, lawyers, accountants, and trust and company service providers combined.
Even if those sectors were filing more reports, it isn’t clear they would result in convictions. The JFIU employs about 100 people, compared to the thousands working for the police National Security Department, meaning it is difficult to make a dent in such activities. In 2021, fewer than 90 people were convicted of money laundering.
That isn’t to say such charges are unheard of. The far better resourced national security police have recently pursued a number of money laundering cases – against government critics.

Cities provide land for ceremonial sites: Organizers in Edmonton and Calgary thrilled to finally have permanent urban spaces for Indigenous gatherings

Full text: In Edmonton’s river valley near the Whitemud Creek, a former piece of farmland is returning to its roots. Indigenous oral histories tell of foraging for medicines here. Ceremonies once took place on this land, some using ochre from a nearby deposit.
This storied spot in Whitemud Park, previously known as the Fox Farms site, is transforming into a permanent, urban Indigenous ceremonial site, a place for sweat lodges, pipe ceremonies, traditional teachings and land-based learning. Expected to open early next year, it’s called kihciy askiy, Cree for sacred land.
This site, a partnership between the Indigenous Knowledge and Wisdom Centre and the City of Edmonton, is the first of its kind in Canada, said Lewis Cardinal, project manager for kihciy askiy – and a “bold act of reconciliation.”
A three-hour drive south in Calgary, a permanent Indigenous gathering space is also advancing. The City of Calgary is exploring the transfer of city-owned land near the confluence of the Bow and Elbow rivers, a traditional gathering place, to a local non-profit organization. The Indigenous Gathering Place Society of Calgary envisions a building and outdoor space for learning, connecting and celebrating Indigenous cultures.
“I truly, with all my heart, believe that we need this,” said Doreen Healy, a member of the Blood Tribe who was taken from her family at the age of five and sent to residential school. Now an elder with the society, Ms. Healy said she cried tears of gratitude and relief when Calgary’s city council unanimously voted in February to move forward on determining a location for the land transfer.
While organizers with kihciy askiy in Edmonton and the Indigenous Gathering Place Society in Calgary describe these projects as overdue, they’re thrilled about what finally having permanent urban spaces for ceremonial gatherings and cultural exchanges will mean for both Indigenous and non-Indigenous people.
“Right now, we’re the only people who have to leave the city in order to do our basic ceremonies,” said Mr. Cardinal. In Calgary, the Indigenous Gathering Place Society notes there are more than 500 spaces devoted to cultures and spirituality in the city, but not one specifically designated for Indigenous ceremonial and cultural practices.
For the past 16 years, Mr. Cardinal, who is Woodland Cree, has been involved in creating a permanent site for Indigenous ceremonies in Edmonton, home to the secondlargest urban Indigenous population in the country. He first worked with a council of elders to bring a proposal to the city in 2006. He rattles off the many meetings, discussions, studies and consultations that have happened since then.
Elder input has continued to drive the project, said Mr. Cardinal, including “marching orders” to create a site responsive to the needs of all Indigenous communities. Elders valued a location accessible by public transit, and it had to offer people an opportunity to connect to the land.
Non-Indigenous Edmontonians can also learn about Indigenous ceremonies and history at kihciy askiy.
The final 4.5-hectare site is on a bus route, said Morgan Bamford, team lead with the City of Edmonton’s Indigenous Relations Office. “It’s about removing the barriers to accessing ceremonial and landbased teaching for people in Edmonton,” he said.
Construction on kihciy askiy is underway and expected to be completed later this year. The $6.5-million project will include a pavilion with washrooms and changing facilities; a storage building; four sweat lodges and a permanent stone heating area; tipis; and a large tent for ceremonial feasts and cultural teachings. The Indigenous Knowledge and Wisdom Centre will operate the site, with the land and buildings owned by the city.
“We know that access to culture and ceremony is key in wellness in our community,” Mr. Cardinal said. “The more that we see Indigenous people recognizing their indigeneity, and also moving into the urban centres, they need to have access to these resources so that they can feel more grounded in who they are.”
Nav Sandhu, program manager at the City of Edmonton overseeing the construction of kihciy askiy, said social procurement was incorporated into the project, including hiring an Indigenous human resources co-ordinator and turning to local Indigenous businesses for labour and resources. And unlike other construction projects, there was a ground blessing ceremony, instead of a groundbreaking ceremony.
Other cities are taking notice. Mr. Cardinal said he’s heard from people in Winnipeg and Toronto looking to learn more about Edmonton’s new site.
“Having these kinds of spaces where Indigenous light can flourish, in whatever that form is, and whatever way that is… these spaces are all really important,” said Heather Dorries, an assistant professor at the University of Toronto in the Department of Geography and Planning and the Centre for Indigenous Studies.
Prof. Dorries researches how urban planning has affected Indigenous peoples and communities. All cities in Canada are built on Indigenous territories, she said, yet Indigenous histories were erased from these places and policies existed to keep Indigenous people out.
In cities, Indigenous people have long worked to make space for gathering and other community needs, Prof. Dorries said.
As urban spiritual and cultural gathering places gain momentum and broader community support, she hopes the previous work of Indigenous people is not forgotten.
In Calgary, Michelle Fournie was introduced to the concept of a gathering place in 2014, through a local workshop on reconciliation. Now volunteer co-chair of the Indigenous Gathering Place Society, Ms. Fournie emphasizes building such a site is not a new idea.
The city’s real estate division is looking into details of the land transfer, and in the meantime, Ms. Fournie said the society is continuing its grassroots approach to engagement and preparing to start a capital campaign next year.
Ms. Fournie wonders what having an Indigenous gathering place when she was a kid would have meant for her life. “I was born and raised in Calgary and as an urban-based Métis person living in the aftermath of intergenerational trauma. I struggled to find a sense of community to learn about myself and other Indigenous peoples,” she said.

Investors follow the big money to Arizona: Canadians are shifting their gaze to the southwestern United States, where home values are low and rents are high

Full text: In search of cash flow for smallscale rental investors, a pair of Vancouver realtors are suggesting buyers shift their gaze from the coast and mountains to the desert of the American Southwest.
“A lot of our clients are firefighters or teachers, doctors or lawyers, and some don’t want to go into crypto or the stock market,” said Amy Leong, a sales advisor with Engel & Volkers Vancouver who, along with business partner Ally Ballam, is opening a satellite office in Scottsdale, Ariz.
Some of their clients have built up equity during the twoyear upswing in residential real estate prices and are sitting on $500,000 to $1-million, she said.
“They are having dinner conversations saying it would be really nice to be able to buy a vacation home, or a family joint venture. … They want to own property across the border.”
The biggest challenge to real estate investing in their home market is the cost of ownership versus the potential rental earnings.
“B.C. and Vancouver real estate does really well over time appreciating – you look at it as a long-term investment. But if you’re doing a 20-per-cent down payment, it’s very hard to find something that cash-flows in Greater Vancouver. That’s what I see myself through working with clients,” said Johanna Williams, a client of Ms. Leong and Ms. Ballam and a mortgage specialist with Royal Bank of Canada. By “cash-flows” she means the rent covers the mortgage and other costs and still adds money to your bank account monthly.
As it happens, one of the fastest-growing trends in real estate investing in the United States – the growth of the single-family rental portfolios held by large institutional investors – has found there are places such as Arizona where home values are relatively low and rents are high enough that cash-flow isn’t a problem.
“It is a more attainable market to enter, certainly than a California or a Seattle,” said Kenneth Perlman, a managing principal with John Burns Real Estate Consulting who focusses on the Southwest market.
“Institutional investors are big into that space, they love SFR, and they are all-in on the Built for Rent space [where a developer creates an entire low-rise subdivision to be managed by rental companies], which is the hottest segment of the market. They want yield and, if you have inflation, rents are going up.”
One of the biggest institutional players in this space is also a Canadian investment firm: “Tricon Residential is one of the largest operators of single-family rental homes in the country,” said Mr. Perlman, with 35,000 homes under management. “The three public single-family REITS – Tricon, Invitation Homes and American Homes 4 Rent – they own and manage almost 171,000 homes nationally.”
John Burns’s data suggest the portfolio of single-family homes owned by institutional capital is about 3 per cent in the U.S., but Arizona is ground zero for the market where it’s closer to 10 per cent. A big driver of that activity is a region with a pleasant climate that remains undervalued relative to other major centres.
“What we bought in Arizona for $700,000 would be $3-million in Vancouver,” said Zia Hirji, an investment adviser who owns a rental condo in Vancouver but recently bought another home in Arizona that he’s listing on Airbnb.
While home values in Arizona shot up 33 per cent year over year in April, the average sale price was just US$569,752 (according to data from the Arizona Regional Multiple Listing Service), which converts to $717,000 Canadian, and remains well below the Greater Vancouver average of $1.35-million (up 35 per cent from 2020).
Two years ago, Ms. Williams bought a preconstruction townhouse in Langley, B.C., as her first investment property, but is planning to sell the never-occupied home and take the proceeds shopping in Arizona.
“Our home has probably gone up half a million in value in two years,” she said. “When we started looking [in Arizona] we saw it was US$650,000 for a lower-end single detached with a pool. Now it’s like US$850,000; that’s like $1.07-million Canadian. That’s not significantly cheaper than here, but we couldn’t buy a million-dollar house here and have it be cash-flow positive,” Ms. Williams said.
There are demographic factors that may keep Phoenix rents rising: 36 per cent of households in the area are rented (lower than the historical peaks of 38 per cent rentals in 2014) and the median population age is 34 (72 per cent of American renters are 44 and younger). According to Arizona State University’s Morrison Institute for Public Policy, rents for some one-bedroom apartments in the Phoenix area have more than doubled since 2020.
And there are other benefits for small landlords, too. An Arizona lease can be written to allow the landlord to raise rent at any time with 30 days’ notice, and if there’s no such provision in an existing lease, landlords just need to wait until a new tenancy begins. And because the state also has no “just cause” requirements for eviction, at the end of a lease a renter who has done nothing wrong (like not paying rent or committing crimes on the premises) can be evicted and rents raised for the next resident.
If you’re a local, the result is a frustrating housing shortage where the costs of home ownership are rising faster than the costs of renting. For an investor with cash to buy, there’s an opportunity.
Single-family rents are up about 12.5 per cent year over year, according to the most recent data from March, Mr. Perlman said.
“If you look at home ownership, payments on an entry-level home are up 40 per cent [largely due to rising interest rates]. What that means is, it costs 25 per cent more to own an entry-level home than to rent.”
Mr. Perlman says he has found little evidence of any significant growth in the number of Canadians flocking to invest in Phoenix, even though it remains a major nesting ground for snowbirds.
Canadians remain the largest share of international purchasers of U.S. residential real estate, despite a falling share in recent years, according to the National Association of Realtors.
In 2020-21, Canadians purchased 8,800 American properties for a total of $4.5-billion, or 8 per cent of international purchases. Florida is still the No. 1 destination, with 38 per cent of purchases, but Arizona was a strong second with 24 per cent (well above third place California’s 7 per cent).
Ms. Leong argues there’s opportunity for growth, not least because less than 20 years ago, after the 2008 financial crisis, Canadians were typically 23 per cent of the market, spending more than $12-billion on more than 40,000 properties across the U.S. annually.
“I personally did the same thing. I bought a couple houses in Arizona,” said Ms. Leong, who listed them on Airbnb when she wasn’t using them herself. “From October to May, our houses were fully booked.”

Full text: 40 Autumn St.
SAINT JOHN Asking Price: $1.25-million Taxes: $7,200 (2021) Lot Size: Two acres Agents: Kelly DeCourcey, Re/Max Professionals Saint John Inc.
THE BACKSTORY Though it has been profiled by HGTV, W Network, Playboy and Chatelaine magazines it’s actually not easy to spot the house that came to be known as Into The Wild just south of the Mount Pleasant neighbourhood of Saint John.
“We used to live about a block and a half away, we lived there for a year and a half when we mentioned to a realtor we were looking for a plot of land to build,” said Judith Mackin. She and her husband, Robert Moore, were directed to a two-acre overgrown lot tucked in behind some of the stately century homes that typify an area that was once part of the rural boundary of Canada’s oldest incorporated city.
“It is one of the largest urban lots you’ll find in the city,” said listing agent Kelly DeCourcey, and its untamed nature was a callback to the origins of Mount Pleasant.
“Back in the day, this would have been the outskirts, for the affluent people that owned the big factories. It’s where a lot of them owned summer homes.”
The story goes that a fire had claimed the original house in the 1930s, and the land had been fallow ever since. “There were no services, no electricity – there were a lot of used condoms,” Mr. Moore said.
“The woman that owned it had it on the market; we low-balled … her, and said basically, ‘We’ll pay you half of what you’re asking.’ ” Surprisingly, that worked.
The couple knew there was only one way to approach such a huge site in a historic neighbourhood: build a thoroughly modern masterwork – the first home either of them had tried to build – from scratch.
“There is something really beautiful about creating your home … not encumbered from his stuff or mine from an earlier marriage,” Ms. Mackin said. “The house also was instrumental in the beginning of my business, Tuck Studio.”
The interior design practice initially occupied the ground floor of the home and has blossomed into a decor and furniture shop that occupies a storefront in a historic building in the core of Saint John.
The house is filled with unique and bespoke touches that are part of Ms. Mackin’s approach to business, but the overall design was created by local architecture firm Acre Architects, founded by fellow Saint John native Monica Adair with partner Stephen Kopp.
The fusion of their styles makes for a home that’s both fun and sophisticated, with sharp, almost industrial, angles that blend with ecofriendly materials.
THE OUTSIDE The house at 40 Autumn St., is not on Google Streetview, never mind that Google hasn’t sent a camera to that street since 2013. But even if they had, the house is set too far back from the road to be gawked at by passersby. Even once you round the curving gravel laneway and spot the squared-off structure clad in steel and timber, you’ve still only seen a glimpse of what’s to come.
Into The Wild is built into the hillside, which rises to the north of the house and slopes down to the south toward the city centre.
While some early plans suggested it command the top of the lot’s heights, the couple followed the advice of one of the 20th century’s great star architects.
“No house should ever be on a hill or on anything. It should be of the hill. Belonging to it. Hill and house should live together, each the happier for the other,” Frank Lloyd Wright wrote in his eponymous 1943 autobiography. Mr. Moore paraphrases the quote and extends the logic: “If you build on a hill, you lose the hill.”
The first impression of the house is a series of rectangles and squares that meet at odd angles, with light wood-clad wings anchored off an imposing steel-clad garage.
“That was a wish-list item of mine; I really wanted a corten moment on the property. … I’m a fan of [artist] Richard Serra and he does these really large corten sculptures outdoors,” Ms. Mackin said. (Corten is corrosion-resistant steel that develops a protective patina of rust over time.)
The living areas are clad in weathered grey planks reclaimed from Wyoming snow fences, which are vast structures designed to keep the windy state’s highways relatively snowdrift free. They are made mainly of hefty ponderosa pine and Douglas fir and last about 10 years before being replaced.
“The rust steel structure, the warmth of the Wyoming wood … the hillside has all of those same colours in the rock face. It’s a wonderful tribute to materials and landscape,” Ms. Mackin said.
THE INSIDE The main entrance is in a breezeway and triangular front porch tucked between garage and house, and opens directly into one of Mr. Moore’s wish-list items: a library, or at least the right side of the hallway here is lined with bookshelves that climb up the open industrial steel stairs to the second level.
“That’s his life as a professor of English and philosophy,” Ms. Mackin said. “His whole education right there.”
The floors on this level are clad in 24inch square tiles, and down a short hall to the left is an office with south-facing floorto-ceiling windows and a walkout to the breezeway. On the way, there’s a threepiece bathroom with a live-edge wood vanity and a walk-in shower. On the dark walls of this room is a burst of colour in a wallpaper mural from Machinne Volanti depicting enormous flowers.
Past an enclosure in the Wyoming fencing (hiding stairs to the lower level) the main hallway opens up to the combined living and dining room; if you weren’t sure this was the party room, the disco ball in the centre of the ceiling is a clue.
The kitchen on the right soars upward to the second-level ceiling, and is open to the loft above. Huge windows facing north draw in light. The backsplash is plexiglass over a custom-made wallpaper from Rollout.ca featuring drawings by artist Chris Lloyd that were used in Mr. Moore’s book of poetry The Golden Book of Bovinities, published as the house was being finished in 2012.
White Corian countertops zig-zag around, making a U-shaped prep area with a peninsula extending toward the living room. Initially, there was built-in banquet seating here, but it was removed for lack of use: “Maritimers like to stand,” Ms. Mackin said, particularly at kitchen parties.
The rear wall has more floor-to-ceiling windows and a sliding door to one of the five decks and to the sweep of lawn that climbs up the slope beyond. The south wall is anchored by a fireplace with a concrete hearth surrounded by Rorschach-patterned tiles in red, orange, blue and pink and white from the Scottish arts collective Timorous Beasties for Clé Tile.
On the upper level, the stairs open to a “flex space” loft (above the kitchen) with seating area, TV on the wall and large windows looking over a rooftop deck facing south. Half of that outdoor space is dedicated to one of the two green roof plantings on the flat-roofed building (the other, above the garage, is accessible from the primary bedroom).
“The ongoing joke is that we have a green roof and we have no interest in gardening at all,” Ms. Mackin said. There are eight types of sedum in the roof, and after desultory weeding Ms. Mackin confesses it was looking a little shoddy about five years ago, but somehow things have turned around and now it flourishes.
“You see how lush it is, we’ve gotten a blanket out and laid on it, and it just bounces back. It’s incredibly durable and hardy.”
This level is floored entirely in a stained and planed version of the Wyoming fencewood, and the rich yellow mixed with dark grain gives it a rugged polish. A long hallway connects the two bedrooms on this level with the laundry room and five-piece bathroom, which has an arresting white penny tile in dark grout that flows across the floor and up one wall to the ceiling. The primary bedroom is not enormous, but has rock and nature views behind window walls to the north and city views to the south, and a wall of closets opposite a feature wall of stormy cloud wallpaper from Nuvolette.
The third bedroom is on the lowest level; there’s no actual basement in the house, as the slope allows for walkouts on “level zero,” which was the former home of the Tuck Studio and has its own entrance south side.
Currently set up like a cross between a man-cave and a gallery featuring Mr. Moore’s artwork, the polished concrete floors connect the bedroom and a large living/studio space under a white-painted ceiling of exposed rafters and ductwork.
The powder room wouldn’t be complete without a wallpaper mural of steam-punkstyle dirigibles.
THE MARKET There’s no doubt this high-design house in its own urban park has a luxury price for Saint John – one of the most affordable real estate cities in the country – but is practically a steal compared with what you pay in much of the rest of the country.
“My sister still lives in Burlington, [Ont.].
She’s always sending me ads of this garage behind a tree for $1-million in Toronto,” Mr. Moore said. “It’s surreal to us! Why would anybody buy a piece of crap in Toronto when you can live here?” For Ms. Mackin, who has lived and loved Saint John her whole life, it’s been amazing seeing the amount of interest “from away.”
And it’s been a boon to her decor business.
“We have been inundated, and we’re just one store,” she said. “Out of the last two years, 50 per cent of my work has come from people moving here.”

Full text: One of the main narratives out of the Ontario election campaign is how Doug Ford came to win the support of private-sector unions, as well as working-class voters looking for a break on rising costs.
This feat has been trumpeted again and again by the Progressive Conservatives, but Mr. Ford now faces a much higher bar.
He’s no longer the municipal politician who surpassed the low expectations many Ontarians had of him early in his tenure in provincial politics: He’s a second-term Premier.
And his government will be judged on issues such as combatting inflation and whether it actually increases the number of long-term care beds and rebuilds the health care system. Mr. Ford will also continue to face questions about the wisdom of his promise to build Highway 413 through prime farmland and Greenbelt northwest of Toronto.
But the much more intractable issue is housing. And on that, Mr. Ford’s policies will face intense scrutiny from across the province, including the labourheavy ridings that his party has now taken from the opposition parties – where jobs are now relatively plentiful, but once-affordable housing is a thing of the past.
The day after the election, Mr. Ford boasted of Andrew Dowie’s Windsor-Tecumseh win, which brings a riding into the PC fold for the first time in nearly a century. Anthony Leardi won in Essex, where the provincial party similarly hasn’t won a seat in decades.
To get a sense of the challenge Mr. Ford and his government will face when it comes to workers not able to afford homes, there’s no better place to look than Windsor, Ont. The city’s unemployment rate dropped significantly in April, and it has been a key site in the Ford and Trudeau government announcements to bolster and transform the province’s auto industry.
But a combination of factors, including buying by those priced out of Toronto and other moreexpensive centres, has led to Windsor home prices in all categories more than doubling in the past three years. The benchmark price for much-in-demand single-family homes was $753,200 in May, up 37 per cent on a yearover-year basis, according to the Windsor-Essex County Association of Realtors.
There’s no doubt that higher interest rates designed to counter “entrenched inflation” will take some of the edge off housing price increases in Windsor, but they will still go up, according to the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp.
In Brampton, where the PCs took three key seats from the NDP, surprising many, prices are weakening, but a semi-detached home still averages around $1.1million. Even in Timmins, Ont., where the PCs punted long-time NDP MPP Gilles Bisson, yearover-year housing prices are up more than 20 per cent.
Days before the election, Mr. Ford was campaigning in an apartment building in Mississauga, where the main concern heard at people’s doors was a belief that they will never have the opportunity to own their own homes. It was something Mr. Ford heard constantly on the hustings. It’s something adviser Amin Massoudi says has doubled the Premier’s resolve on the issue and “it’s one area where we do have some levers to pull.”
There is no province, save for British Columbia, that has as massive a housing problem as Ontario. And the spread is now far and wide beyond the GTA.
The PCs have promised to address the supply side by building 1.5 million homes in the next 10 years, and to crack down on “land and housing permit speculators who are artificially choking the supply of new homes and driving up costs.” There will be other plans brought forward, too, said Mr. Massoudi – without disclosing further details.
But conversely, if continued interest-rate hikes from the Bank of Canada weaken the sector too significantly, the Ontario government could have another problematic housing issue on its hands. Real estate, and renting and leasing, makes up more than 14 per cent of Ontario’s $851-billion GDP, a bigger slice of the pie than other major economic categories such as manufacturing, or health and education.
And if the PCs want to be able to continue to sell themselves as the best stewards of the economy and the province’s finances, they will have to make sure a key pillar of the province’s GDP doesn’t end up in too weakened a state.
The fine balance for this second-term Premier will be giving hope to those workers who some day want to own, who now feel it’s out of reach, while not rocking the boat too much for people already invested in the housing market.
Many other political leaders in Canada face the same quandary – the problem is just that much bigger in Mr. Ford’s Ontario.

They came. They idled. They left.: The spectacle in the capital seized us, then it was gone. What have the convoy protesters been doing since they went home?

Full text: One interesting thing about the convoy for Lee Bates and Sandy Williams and Luke Kendze and a lot of others once they got back home from Ottawa is that they remembered it as a revolution and a revelation – and not just in the religious sense, though that was true as well. Now that the pandemic has killed 15 million people worldwide, now that CSIS has revealed how alarmed it was (and is) about the northward drift of “ideologically motivated violent extremism” during February’s occupation of Ottawa, now that support for the convoy may be a requirement to lead the Conservative Party, it might help to know what stuck with the people who descended on Canada’s capital. Are Lee and Luke and Sandy permanent converts to the populist cause? What did they take away from Ottawa, beyond memories of barbecues and bouncy castles?
The three returning warriors are at this moment sitting out a blizzard in the Roadking Truck Stop on Barlow Trail, in the tangled southeast quadrant of Calgary, one of the staging points where the convoy took shape at the end of January. It is the first week of March. Lee and Luke got home a few days ago from their month in Ottawa. Sandy is still on his way, due to arrive in Slave Lake, in northern Alberta, tonight.
The Roadking dining room is across a passageway from the Roadking slot-machine room. The dining room is Irish-stew brown. Three pieces of fried chicken and gravy go for $13.99. It is also some kind of magnet, pulling convoy memories out of the lads one last time before they reshoulder the yoke of their daily lives. The convoy kicked off as a Western Canadian anti-Trudeau protest (the brainchild of James Bauder, a born-again Calgary conservative and conspiracy theorist); evolved into an anti-vaccine-mandate march; then hyper-morphed again into a propaganda-fest for a groaning board of interest groups: right-wing populists and proto-fascists, born-again anti-vaxxers and libertarian anticommunists, Indigenous protesters and family folk, eco-warriors and dope smokers, Proud Boys and anarchists, not to mention thousands of others just happy to be able to party again without being shamed into wearing a mask. Lee and Luke and Sandy figure they were a part of history.
In fact, history is another reason they are here at the Roadking: to talk to Monique Young, a 41-yearold real estate agent from Thunder Bay, who hopped in her four-wheeler to follow the convoy to Ottawa, and is now compiling an oral history of the trek, Journey to Freedom. The convoy is one of the highlights of their lives: their Selma, their Woodstock, their Women’s March, their Jan. 6.
You possibly disagree. You may be one of the majority of Canadians who overwhelmingly supported vaccine mandates and mask-wearing, who objected to the protesters’ demands to a) end all pandemic restrictions and b) dissolve the federal government.
You might be part of the roughly 70 per cent of the country that disagreed with the convoyistas’ lawbreaking, horn-blasting, flag-flaunting tactics and thought they were – to quote a common description on Twitter – “a bunch of yahoos.”
But this story is not about you, my privileged, sanctimonious, laptop-wielding friend. This story is about a handful of Them, the Outcast Others, once they got back home, and how their strange, daring, ridiculous, polarizing and hugely successful convoy looks to them in repose. They hijacked the national conversation for three weeks, hoping to change how we think and talk, and therefore who we are and how we live.
Did it work? They seem as surprised as the rest of us.
Lee and Sandy didn’t know each other before they parked their vehicles at Albert and Kent streets in Ottawa, a few blocks south of Parliament Hill. There they created a community of their own. That’s always fun. The co-operation and the camping and the shared mission, plus having to get along flankto-shank in a tight space, made them feel they were comrades, in it together.
The men loved their campout. “Why was it called an occupation?” Lee will say. “I have no idea. We were peaceful. We shut our horns off at seven o’clock at night. We were respectful. The streets were cleaner than they had ever been. Of course, you’re always going to piss somebody off. That’s fine: We, as citizens of this country, have the right to protest, to move freely and to assemble. And that was taken away from us.” The idea of civil society as a contradictory truce of compromises seems to upset him.
He wants something clearer. “This has been happening since the inception of capitalism and the central bank system: They’ve created these divisions. Down at Kent and Albert, we didn’t have those divisions. People realized that colour, race, creed, political views, whatever, it didn’t matter, we’re all just one under God. Then your perspective starts to change, and you become enlightened to the fact that we’ve been lied to.” The litany of lies is long: The mainstream media and the MK Ultra LSD experiments the CIA conducted on unsuspecting subjects in the late 1950s are just the top of the list.
Three weeks later, as “the beatdown” began, the three men hied out of Ottawa together. They pulled over in Kenora to visit vets at the local Legion. (Lee also had a bad tooth extracted.) Their ebbing convoy idled again in Steinbach, Man., to attend the funeral of a convoy trucker who died two days after he got home from Ottawa (“pneumonia, not COVID,” Lee insists), and again in Winnipeg at the Canadian Museum for Human Rights, which Lee found hilarious. “You needed a mask to enter the human-rights museum, which I consider a violation of my human rights.”
Then they were home. It was hard to convey to their waiting loved ones the force of the bond, the emancipating sense of mission, they felt in Ottawa.
“It was a bumpy landing,” Sandy says, “to be sure.”
Their reasons for going to Ottawa had almost nothing to do with trucker mandates. Sandy Williams lives in Slave Lake, a three-hour drive north of Edmonton, where he has at various points run a grassfed cattle operation, a hydro-excavation trucking business, a gravel supply yard and a construction company with his father and brothers since he went to work after high school. He drove to Ottawa because he considers the Trudeau government “corrupt.” He’s a fan of The Creature of Jekyll Island: A Second Look at the Federal Reserve, which has been described as ripping the cover off “the grand illusion called money … the most blatant scam of all history … you’ll never trust a politician again, or a banker.”
Sandy has two sons, Kayden, 15, and Blake, 13, with him in his rig. His wife home-schools their four children, so missing class hasn’t been a problem. He’s 45 now: The convoy woke him up politically, made him feel less isolated up in Slave Lake. He’ll be back in Calgary in two weeks to join the Alberta Prosperity Project, which believes “there’s no deal to be had for Alberta within Confederation.” They’re not separatists. “Their hope is for each province to stand up independently, but collectively.” The movement has about 1,500 supporters so far.
Lee’s 45, too. He and his father farm nearly 8,000 organic acres near Stettler, Alta., two and a half hours northeast of Calgary. He also runs his fertilizer business and a grain brokerage and a land development operation, and recently bought an adventure sporting-goods store in Stettler. He’s shaped like a fridge and has a flattop haircut and a small soul patch and a deep Vaderish voice and a smoker’s cough that sounds like a cold starter kicking over.
Lee was one of the first people to get interested in the convoy at the end of December. “I’ve never protested anything before,” he admits. Like Sandy and Luke, he didn’t decide to make the trip until a few days before the truckers headed out. “Everybody that was on that trip didn’t know they were going until they left,” Sandy says. “And people don’t do that, not in the heart of winter when it’s 30 below and you’ve got business going on.” That was another convergent detail that made them all think they were supposed to be there.
Lee joined to expose “the coercion and corruption and collusion of the federal government.” But he especially wanted “to shed light on the Wold Economic Forum,” the Geneva-based Davos darling that touts stakeholder capitalism so corporations can partner with governments to make more efficient global decisions. Mark Carney (Bank of Canada, Bank of England) and Chrystia Freeland (Deputy Prime Minister, Finance Minister) and Yo-Yo Ma (cellist) and Larry Fink (CEO of BlackRock, the world’s largest investment fund) are some of its trustees. Lee believes the forum is a front for global elites to reverse overpopulation by decimating fertility rates, hence the vaccines. He figures 70 per cent of Justin Trudeau’s cabinet are compromised by the forum and that Conservative Party leadership frontrunner Pierre Poilievre is, too. “They’re promoting a new world order,” he tells me moments after we meet. Lee has a lot of dark, semi-exhausting theories, but he’s a generous, energetic, often funny guy.
Luke’s the youngest, 33, and the least intellectually adamant of the three, a tall rail of a man with a dark beard, who lives on his family’s 1,800-acre farm near Didsbury, Alta., 90 kilometres north of Calgary, where he runs a busy agricultural and heavy duty mechanical repair shop. When Sandy’s truck broke down on the way to Ottawa, Luke fixed it. Luke likes to lean his elbows across the table to talk. His bugbear is that “Justin Trudeau wants to shut down independent media.” He means Bill C-11, the Online Streaming Act. The federal government wants streaming companies such as Netflix and Facebook to pay more to Canadian media producers. The right-wing media outlets Luke ingests, among others, claim the bill is a form of online censorship.
Meanwhile, they all lament the carbon tax, the rising price of homes and gas and everything else, the disappearance of the middle class and the federal government’s unacknowledged surveillance of Canadians’ phones to track the spread of COVID-19 (albeit without identifying details). They are especially peeved that Mr. Trudeau – “he’s supposed to work for us” – wouldn’t talk to the protesters in Ottawa, wouldn’t acknowledge their claim to importance. “We drove across the country for something,” Sandy says. “And they refused to meet with us.”
Oh, and they despise the mainstream media.
“The mainstream media are lying about everything,” someone says. “There’s people all across the country that have another point of view, but it’s
quashed.” By “mainstream media” they seem to mean CBC and CTV, because the two national newscasts homed in on a swastika flag in Ottawa – coverage that, they insist, branded all convoyistas as fascists. Unfair! But they are only too happy to repeat the falsehood, retweeted by mainstream Fox News to 1.3 million viewers, that “women were being trampled by horses” – something that never happened.
Where do they get their news instead? Like a surging number of convoy supporters, the trio are drawn to TikTok (roughly a billion users, compared with Twitter’s 300-odd-million), which they believe to be free of government funding and influence. Luke consults the Western Standard and Rebel News (Ezra Levant’s Canadian equivalent of right-wing Breitbart News), but thinks “the truth lies in between them all.”
Lee’s go-tos include The Epoch Times and Rumble. The latter – started by Canadian Chris Pavlovski – is a right-wing twin of YouTube, headquartered in Florida.
Rumble attracts 44 million visitors a month and is already an important artery in the right-wing circulatory system. It also traffics in bald-faced lies, which is nothing new in politics. A recent story “confirmed” that Justin Trudeau owns shares in Acuitas Therapeutics, a British Columbia company that creates part of the biological delivery system for Pfizer’s COVID vaccine. There is no evidence – and the story doesn’t provide any – that Mr. Trudeau has or ever had a stake in Acuitas.
That hasn’t weakened Lee Bates’s conviction that the Prime Minister owns a stake, because, you know, it could be true. And for Lee and Sandy and Monique and Luke, what could be true seems to be more persuasive than what is provable. (Speculation is nondeniable.) “Tell me this,” Lee says of Mr. Trudeau: “Why did he buy 10 times more vax than there is population?” Because the federal government wanted to secure an adequate supply of vaccine when the global panic for it resembled The Hunger Games? No: because “he’s stealing our money.” This refusal to acknowledge another possible explanation becomes frustrating, then sad: In the vast spectrum of human motive, Lee and his cohort see only conspiracy. Eventually this exhausts you. Maybe that is their intention. They like to state their countervailing positions, but seem less interested in a dialogue (for all they claim to have wanted one with Mr. Trudeau in Ottawa). What they want is to be acknowledged as having acceptable public opinions. They want to be taken seriously. They want to be inside the fence.
But their disdain for the mainstream media is also personal. They’re being persecuted, they claim, for having unconventional views.
“You’re allowed to have different views,” Luke insists.
At first I think he means you’re allowed to hold an opinion that dissents from the mainstream, which is true. But, over time, I realize they mean something very different: that no one who holds a dissenting opinion, even one more or less devoid of facts or evidence, should be chastised publicly for stating it publicly. “Not being judged,” is how Sandy puts it.
“We can agree to disagree,” Sandy adds, “but mutual respect is necessary. Freedom to have your own opinion.”
This is a new kind of thinking, conceived in social media, gestated via pandemic, given life by the convoy. Speaking out is suddenly equal in weight to having something legitimate to say. Social media has helped eliminate the distinction between a lie and a fact: They both appear in the same venues, on equal footing.
There’s no widely convincing theory as to why Lee and his like resist facts and proven science, why they’re susceptible to seeing conspiracies everywhere. Are they brilliant or have they been brainwashed? Has a life of unrelenting hard work made them resentful of the status quo? Winston Churchill is said to have thought, “the best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter.” There are theologians who believe there is a resistant nook in every one of us that seeks to be free and somehow transcendent, to be forgiven for what we are, despite what we are.
Lee and Luke and Sandy and Monique aren’t disruptive trolls inventing misinformation. They’re simply consumers and repeaters of it. But even just repeating the anti-Narrative narrative has a cost. By joining the convoy, they automatically (unfairly, maybe, but automatically nonetheless) became associated with its professed central premise: that loss of life due to the spread of COVID-19 (15 million dead) is no more important than a temporary loss of personal autonomy (I don’t want to wear a mask or get a jab). That was the calculus that offended a majority of Canadians. Lee and Luke and Sandy and Monique underestimated the reputational cost of their so-called freedom of choice. Is it any wonder, then, that to avoid the ethical darkness of their position, they have convinced themselves that the government and the medical system are lying about the severity of the disease? Psychologists sometimes call that projection. The greater the denial, the more intransigent the defence.
Whatever else you say about the convoy, it was an expression of widespread social and political discontent. That impression set in the moment Sandy started driving in northern Alberta and saw people waving flags from overpasses. He saw them on his way home, too. “When you hit the road and you see all these people, the heart really filled up with pride and emotion,” Sandy said. “We started as a convoy, and it turned into the world’s biggest parade.”
But the convoy in retrospect is like an object in a distorting mirror: It looks bigger than it actually was. The lads all believe 1.5 million people showed up in Ottawa on a given Saturday while they were there. The official police estimate pegged the crowd at 20,000. Still, Sandy says, “the movement’s all over the world – and started by a bunch of hillbillies in Alberta.”
The convoy wasn’t just organized, it was ordained. An Almighty presence was there all along.
They all felt it. “We should have had a fatality along the way,” Sandy says of the long drive across the country. “But it was just unbelievable, a divine movement, by design, not by accident.”
Luke hadn’t even planned on joining: He had engine jobs stacked up at home in Alberta. Then one night he went to bed at 10 p.m. and woke up at 1 a.m.
and said to his wife, Tania, “I have to go to Ottawa.”
“I know you do,” she said.
As soon as he arrived on the outskirts of the capital, he was put to work sourcing supplies the protesters needed downtown. Right away, strange and wondrous things started happening.
One of the organizers downtown would call Luke on his cell and declare a desperate need for some commodity useful to protesters: shovels, say. Or salt, for the icy roads during the minus-30 days.
And like that, somehow, the shovels or the salt would show up, donated by the gross and by the hundredweight. “We had no idea where it was coming from,” Luke said. “And this happened over and over again.” Bug wash? Abracadabra! Bug wash, donated anonymously. Outdoor toilets?
Here, suddenly and inexplicably, are your portapotties. Boxes of oranges? Fresh underwear?
Socks? Check, check, check. “It was huge at the end of it. The Creator had his hands all over it. We had more talks about the divine than I’ve ever had in my life. You just felt at peace while you were doing it.” To Luke, it was the Biblical parable of the loaves and the fishes, the feeding of the five thousand, all over again.
So who was organizing it?
Luke pointed to the sky. “Right there.”
Lee and I left the truck stop in Calgary, climbed into his vehicle and headed for his spread outside Stettler, east of Red Deer. It was a three-hour drive, what with the snow. There was a tin of chew in the console next to the driver’s seat, some toothpicks, a blue and a green scented pine-tree freshener hanging from the mirror. It was the cab of someone who drives a lot, which is to say no different from any rural truck in Alberta. On the way out of Calgary, we stopped at Hockey Life so Lee could have a smoke and pick up a pair of skates for Mackenzie, his 13-year-old daughter. She and her 11-yearold sister, Sierra, are good hockey players. Lee’s one of their coaches. He was a first-rate hockey player himself and at 17, was offered an open-ended tryout with the Hartford Whalers. He turned it down. “I was sick of hockey by then.” He had an anguished youth. His father lost the farm for a while when Lee was 13. Lee was shot in the shoulder by a cousin, dropped out of high school, had a daughter at 22, fought for custody and won. He then put himself through university, earned a science degree, became a geologist. He’s been working ever since. “That’s all we know how to do around here,” he once told me. He may be 45, but he has a grandchild.
We stopped again at Outlaw Meats, deep in Hutterite country, to pick up 306 pounds of freshly butchered ($1 a pound) wild elk Lee and his father had shot. The staff were full of news of the appeal of Tamara Lich, one of the convoy organizers. They were also completely convinced Fidel Castro is Mr. Trudeau’s father.
As the hours rolled by in the truck, Lee talked.
He talked a lot. He said he’d been going down the “rabbit hole” of the internet for a decade. He meant he’d been reading alternative, non-mainstream sources. He had some wild opinions, even by convoy standards. He was convinced the vaccines will affect our major organs; that Bill Gates supports eugenics, the selective breeding of human beings. (There is no evidence of this, but it’s a popular line of elided logic on right-wing conspiracy websites: Mr. Gates’s father was on the board of Planned Parenthood, which was founded by feminist Margaret Sanger, who was tangentially endorsed in the 1920s by eugenicists, ergo Mr. Gates is into eugenics.) “You wonder,” Lee said in the truck, “are they actually conducting mass genocide on the world population? Is that what we’re witnessing?” Then we moved on to the Clintons and funnelling kids out of Haiti for sex trafficking. “It sounds so outlandish,” Lee said. “But it’s actually happening.”
Sometimes Lee’s theories got scary wild. Maybe it was the snowstorm, the way the headlights made a tunnel through the blizzard and the night. These theories were “off the record” because they were about “the stuff I don’t know 100 per cent fact.” He is semi-convinced, for instance, that Google calls its search engine Chrome and its navigational software Adrena – I think I have this right – to dogwhistle the word adrenachrome. Adrenachrome is oxidized human adrenaline. According to Lee (off the record) and QAnon (very much on the record), adrenachrome is being harvested from the pineal glands of kidnapped children to confer everlasting life to Satanists, whose numbers include the Silicon Valley tech kings and, of course, Mr. Trudeau.
Lee is by no means the only person rolling this confection around in his mind. According to Wired, the theory enjoys “robust hidden virality” in less visited corners of the internet. Then again, anti-Semitic blood-drinking tropes have been with us since at least the Middle Ages. Fear lives forever.
As soon as we pulled up in front of his spread half an hour outside Stettler, Lee transformed into the most normal father and husband in the world.
He introduced me to his wife, Melanie, and his younger daughter, Sierra, who were headed off to hockey. Both girls look just like their mother. He showed me the stuffed and mounted wildebeests and African buffalo and eland and kudu he and his father shot on safari in Africa, massive heads that gaze down from Lee’s living room with what I thought was an unapproving stare. (We’re all suggestible about something.) He wouldn’t show me his guns; he has “about 30.” Then we stepped outside and he gave me a shy but quietly proud tour of his new cold-storage shed where he parks his gigantic 620-horsepower tractor and his combine and his semi-trailer and his sixty-foot-long air drill ($245,000 used). He spoke of hefty bank debts and explained how he hopes to pay them off by trading equities, brokering grain and flipping reconditioned farmland. (He managed two flips last year and has plans for five more this year.) He’s watching crypto stocks as well. He and his father stopped raising cattle years ago, but they’re planting canola, wheat, barley, yellow peas and flax this spring. He hopes to be worth $20-million in 10 years. In two weeks, he’s going on a bear hunt.
These were the details of his real life, far from the frothy dystopia of convoy camping conspiracies in Ottawa. He showed me the corner of the shed where he has installed a climbing wall for the girls and where he keeps his mementoes from the convoy, including two Canadian flags he flew in Ottawa. He plans to donate one to the rec centre and the other to the school in Stettler.
We walked back to the house and down into the basement rec room, where a long bank of green leather recliners had been set up in a big curve in front of a TV so huge it looked like a deep-space radar dish – a great spot to watch a hockey game together.
Mackenzie was sitting in one of the recliners, texting on her phone. Lee looked at Mackenzie and nodded. “She’ll probably go try out for the Red Deer team,” he said. “She was offered a spot this year.” Both daughters play league hockey, but the Red Deer squad is the equivalent of Double A. The game’s faster and more competitive and less friendly.
“Maybe,” Mackenzie said, not looking up from her phone. She’s slim for a defender, but her skating and puck skills are super-strong, and she likes the rough action in front of the net.
“You will,” Lee said.
“No, maybe.” It was the first and only time all day I’d heard anyone openly defy something Lee had said.
The next morning, I took a cab to Didsbury, three hours away, for $375. (There wasn’t a car to rent in all of Alberta.) The sun had come out again and the wide foothill sky seemed to be filled with nothing but time. In the course of the three-hour drive – shorter than the one Lee makes to take his girls to their hockey games in Lethbridge or Medicine Hat, and then redrives to get them home – I met four people: the waitress at the Ramada Hotel, who brought me fresh milk in the Breakfast Room; the cab driver; a clerk in a gas station who sold me a honey bun; and Luke, when I got to Didsbury. In downtown Toronto, where I live, I meet four people in five minutes walking two blocks to the dry cleaner – and at least two of them, the jackass in the bike lane and the tool in the dry cleaner who thinks he’s the only customer in the universe, will somehow challenge the size and shape of my existence. That happens all day long. I think it’s harder in the city, where you come face to face with other human beings all the time, to believe whatever your compulsions want to believe.
Luke was up to his arms in the hood of a truck in his shop at Kendze Mechanical Services, the agricultural and heavy-duty mechanical repair shop he operates in Didsbury. The shop’s in the big shed next to his house, which is across the road and down a field from his parents’ home, which is next to both his brother’s home and the original farmstead where his grandmother lives. He does not consider this arrangement claustrophobic, the way some people might. Luke had been in the shop non-stop since he got back from Ottawa. Tania, his wife, had just returned with Ava, their six-year-old, from a birthday mani-pedi in town when Beau and Dax, their boys, arrived with Tania’s parents, who’d driven over from their own house 75 kilometres to the east. Tania thought Luke seemed different when he got back from Ottawa – clearer, or calmer, or something. “I’ve learned about God all my life,” he said to her the day he got home. “But in Ottawa I got to know Him.” Luke met Tania 12 years ago at the Calgary Stampede. But then Tania went away to Bible College in London, and he didn’t see her for two years. Luke wove his own stint at Capernwray Harbour Bible College on Thetis Island, B.C., into his mechanic’s apprenticeship at John Deere.
They married 10 years ago, when Luke came back to farm with his father and brother and started his engine business. He’s been working hard, “sleeping four hours a night,” ever since. He pays himself a salary of $80,000 a year.
The engine business has six employees, down three because of the pandemic. The shop is packed fender to hood with massive semi cabs and lifted engines, drive trains and cylinder heads, all laid out like the brains of a robot. The shop’s crowded because jobs are backed up because he can’t get parts. The green tractor by the window has been here seven months; that’s a $65,000 rebuild. A semi in the yard has been waiting three weeks for cams and cylinder heads; that’s a $25,000 job. The delays have in turn created a labyrinth of interim financings and partial and extended payments.
Prepandemic, Luke made two calls to get a good price on a part; these days it’s 15 to 20 calls, “and I don’t care about the price.” He roams wrecking yards to find engine control units, which is why the wrecking-yard owners – normally the most laidback people in the auto supply chain-of-being – are taking stress leaves from being on the phone so much. Luke’s gross margin is down 35 per cent in the interim. A bottle of Freon to charge a truck’s air-conditioning system used to cost less than $300. It now runs $780. A box of mechanics’ gloves used to go for $6; now they’re $30. But at least now you can actually find mechanics’ gloves.
But for all the loneliness and isolation the lockdowns created, for all the outrage Lee experienced watching “the beatdown” and hearing the mainstream media portray the protesters as a solid mass of sameness, the pandemic had a silver lining: It forced him to slow down. “It was a bit of a lifestyle change,” he admits. “So I could be with my kids.”
Not that the pandemic made even that easy.
Luke likes to swim with his kids, the way Lee likes to play hockey with his girls, but hasn’t been able to for two years, because he isn’t vaccinated. He couldn’t stage his company’s annual barbecue. “I know multiple people who lost their jobs because they wouldn’t get jabbed,” he said – which seemed unfair to him, because both vaxxed and unvaxxed were getting sick. His entire family contracted COVID-19.
He said all this sitting in the kitchen, which is also part of the dining room and the playroom, under one central atrium. It’s a popular design in rural Alberta. The walls were grey and a vase of pink tulips stood out prettily on the central kitchen island. Tania was offering around a bottle of caramel-flavoured creamer for our coffees.
Luke was scanning his phone, which he has been paying less attention to since the convoy. In Ottawa, he posted daily to Facebook and lots of people liked his entries. But Instagram and TikTok and Facebook make him wary, too. “I find it to be an alternate reality,” he said. “It’s not the same as talking face to face. The thing about social media is, how do you know what’s true? That’s why it’s important to know actual people.” Tania has sworn off social media entirely. “I ended up being a lot less overworked,” she said, and laughed. “There’s so much negativity. And so much influence.”
“When it’s at your fingertips,” Luke said, across the island in the kitchen, “it’s dangerous.”
Before the convoy, Luke had never been east of the border between Saskatchewan and Manitoba.
He’d never been to the place the greedy, godless, liberal, Eastern bastards lived. The long drive east into terra incognita astounded him: It was spectacular. His favourite stretch was the spin through Algoma in northern Ontario. Now he wants to go back, to drive all the way to the Maritimes, and Tania wants to go with him. Her father’s from Cornerbrook, N.L., after all, but somehow this country is still of sufficiently vast scale that she has never visited. “I’ve heard Montreal and Quebec are beautiful,” she said. So much yearning, so easily satisfied, still to be satisfied. It seemed like a yearning that would be easy to harness.
“Do you remember that old idea someone in Ottawa had,” I said suddenly, “to put Parliament on a train for a summer, and have it hold its sessions in different places across the country?” They did not. It was an idea from the late 1970s, maybe, before they were born.
“What a great idea,” Luke said.
Now they want to see France and Italy, too. Before the convoy, Luke had no desire to travel or do much of anything except hunker down and work.
“Before I went to Ontario” – he enunciated the word delicately, as if it were some kind of exotic spiritual practice – “if things got bad, the separatism thing in Alberta, I might have gone for that.
But when you drive across Canada and there’s that moral kindness and that moral support, your viewpoint changes.” Whatever else the convoy did, it managed to expand Luke’s world. It put him among strangers, but they wanted him to be there.

Full text: Late last winter, Alan Martino and Tony Wang started their search for a home in Calgary.
The couple had moved from Ottawa just six months earlier and were looking to buy a place spacious enough to accommodate Mr. Wang’s home office in a neighbourhood close to the University of Calgary, where Mr. Martino works.
After scouring trendy central neighbourhoods such as Inglewood and Bridgeland, as well as the Kensington area, it didn’t take long before the couple found the home of their dreams.
By the end of March, after a month-long search, the couple moved on a 1,200-square-foot, two-bedroom-plus-den townhouse for $350,000 at Arrive at Bowness, an award-winning complex in Calgary’s northwest, whose sheet-metal siding and bright-red accents make the homes stand out in a sea of taupe.
“[Many] townhouses look the same as the ones built in the eighties,” Mr. Wang says. “But this one is pretty unique, the design is pretty modern – I really like that.”
They looked at a handful of single-family homes, but found they didn’t quite fit their lifestyle.
“In Calgary, most of the singlefamily homes in the inner city require a lot of maintenance,” and would have involved more work than they wanted to take on, Mr. Wang says.
They also didn’t want to worry too much about the property’s upkeep, such as mowing the lawn or shovelling snow, he says. “We want to be able to work and have fun. We find that houses are too much work to take care of.”
This is precisely one of the perks of townhouse living, according to local real estate adviser Justin Havre. “Some townhouses come with landscaping and snow removal already included in the condominium fees.”
But having fewer hassles is only part of the growing appeal of townhomes. A more attainable price point and lower condo fees allow young couples such as Mr. Martino and Mr. Wang to afford to live in a community of their choosing.
“We figured out very quickly that in Calgary having a car is huge,” Mr. Martino says. “So [if] we’re going to drive anyway, we might as well buy a place that we like.”
The mix of existing (and forthcoming) amenities and the community feel of Bowness played key roles in their decision. “We have lots of colleagues who work or live in the area; they tell us about how close people are in the neighbourhood,” Mr. Martino says. “For me, it’s perfect.”
As Calgary strives to attract young talent, the rowhouse segment might be on the verge of a renaissance. Today, townhomes represent roughly 10 per cent of the housing stock in the city, and their popularity is steadily increasing. Over the past decade, nearly 13,000 townhomes were completed in Calgary – nearly as many as there were in the preceding 20 years.
“[Townhouses] are tending to be built in ‘first ring’ suburbs because it’s close to transit, it’s close to schools, close to amenities,” says Chris Ollenberger, managing principal of QuantumPlace Developments. “And they’re a more affordable option than a singlefamily home because they’re driven by land prices.”
Earlier this year, as the detached market soared in Calgary, buyers started to take notice of the advantages of townhouses, driving sales to an all-time high in the first quarter of 2022, according to the Calgary Real Estate Board (CREB).
“We’re definitely seeing more and more buyers moving to townhouses because of the significant price increase in the detached segment,” Mr. Havre says.
“Some people are getting priced out of the single-family detached, so they’re going to go down to the next, and more affordable segment, which would be townhouses.”
But affordability isn’t the only reason townhomes are becoming more popular. According to Mr. Ollenberger, while many Calgarians still seek a suburban lifestyle, a growing number of people are letting go of the singlefamily dream home to live closer to the city’s core.
“I think there is a market where people are specifically looking for townhouses because of the price point, and it gives them the option to live closer to the city,” he says. “And then there are people that feel like they’ve been knocked out of the singlefamily and duplex market, but they don’t want to drive further out until they qualify.”
Indeed, although Mr. Havre believes most Calgary buyers would still prefer a single-family home, he recognizes townhomes have become a reasonable alternative, as this segment helps fill the gap between single-family homes and apartments.
“You can get townhouses with an attached garage, you can get townhouses with a small yard.
You may not necessarily get as big of a garage or a big yard, but it’s a small trade-off.”
For Mr. Martino and Mr. Wang, buying a townhouse was not a trade-off but a deliberate choice.
“That’s what we were actually looking for, [because] it’s the best of both worlds,” Mr. Wang says.
“It has a management company taking care of everything for you, and also has the space we need.”
And as more millennials such as Mr. Martino and Mr. Wang climb up the housing ladder, this trend signals a shift in lifestyle and buyer preferences that might improve the viability of middledensity housing, a much-needed segment in Calgary, where detached homes in the suburbs are still plentiful.
“I think it’s just a sign of growth as a city and growth as a country in terms of what our expectations of housing are,” Mr. Ollenberger says about the rising popularity of townhomes. On the one hand, he says, townhouses can be a “rejuvenating factor” for established neighbourhoods, while in new suburban communities, “they are a good way to achieve some of the density targets that Calgary is looking for.”

Rising rates pose risk to affordable housing program, B.C. developer warns: Attempts to curb inflation are having ‘unintended’ effects on new rental units, Quadra Homes VP Shawn Bouchard says

Full text: A Metro Vancouver developer is sounding the alarm that rising interest rates are putting in jeopardy a federal program that encourages private developers, non-profits and municipalities to deliver affordable housing.
Shawn Bouchard is vice-president of Quadra Homes, a private developer that delivered 121 affordable rental units to West Kelowna a year ago with a project called Harbour Ridge.
He said his project was feasible because of a federal program that offers construction loans with highly appealing terms. It was also feasible because of $27-million in fee reductions by the township of Langley. As well, his company – builders of luxury condos – could afford to do it for a small profit, which isn’t often the case.
A developer’s profit is usually 15 per cent to 20 per cent.
Inspired by the success of the Kelowna project, Quadra Homes purchased five acres for a 410unit affordable rental project in the township of Langley. Once it was rezoned, they again applied for the federal government’s Rental Construction Financing Initiative (RCFI), run by the Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp.
The four-building project at the corner of 83rd Avenue and 208th Street is shovel ready, with an agreement in place that it will remain 100 per cent below market housing for at least 21 years.
Of those units, 283 would be 10 per cent below market; and 127 units would be 20 per cent below market, operated by a non-profit organization.
However, because of climbing interest rates, Mr. Bouchard has had to cut the number of affordable units by half – a measure that would be unnecessary, he says, if the federal government would cap the borrowing rate, so developers have certainty.
Now, the plan is for half market condos, which will subsidize only 210 below-market rental units.
“It’s the unintended consequence of the interest-rate policy trying to curb inflation,” Mr. Bouchard said. “It will stifle supply in those [rental] marketplaces because people will cancel their projects, en masse. I’m not talking a small amount, but a very large amount of projects will be put on hold or completely cancelled.”
Financial adviser Matt Morrish says that renters are going to feel the pain of rising costs in the year ahead.
“The trickle down to renters and those who have inability to adjust cash flow will be felt.
There are limits on how much rent can increase each year, but over time, it will be a cost that’s passed on to a tenant.”
The RCFI program has been popular with developers, including not-for-profit, because they could borrow money at a low, locked-in rate for 10 years and amortized over 50 years.
Mr. Bouchard knew interest rates would climb when he started the Langley project, so he worked with a 2-per-cent rate in his early pro forma calculations.
When he received final commitment of funding three months ago, the numbers still worked.
In the past 10 months, he says he’d already added around $14million because of inflation on construction costs.
An option would be to go back to the drawing board and apply for an all-condo strata development that could potentially make them around $50-million, but his company doesn’t want to do that. He’d like the government to commit to the 2-per-cent rate that he had been working with 21/2 months ago. That was the rate that made the affordable housing project workable, he says. He argues that the point of the lowcost loan, which is part of the national housing strategy, is to deliver affordable housing.
“I found my own solution, but even then it’s pretty painful. … I’m going to the mat here, trying to make this work because I care.
We are big developers, we have done a lot of work, and everything has to make financial sense of course, but there are limits. Affordability is getting blown up all over the place.”
In an e-mail response, the CMHC said it was monitoring the effects of rising interest rates on home construction, and is working with all its partners “in a challenging environment.”
In a letter, the CMHC told Mr. Bouchard in March that it wouldn’t be possible to offer a lower interest rate because of the government’s loan rules.
Mr. Bouchard has the support of Langley Mayor Jack Froese, as well as Conservative MP for Langley Tako Van Popta.
“The for-sale condo market is so hot and profitable, why would any private enterprise party want to do something like below-market rental, unless they were forced to do it?” Mr. Van Popta said.
“All they are looking for is a system whereby they can get a longer-term commitment at a lower and secured interest rate. I thought that was very reasonable, and it’s not being taken seriously by the government, who keep saying they are doing so much for affordable housing. I’m saying, ‘No, you’re not.’ ” Mr. Froese said he doesn’t have developers normally knocking on the township’s door looking to do affordable housing projects.
“I know that the federal government basically calls the shots and the CMHC has to follow. But it’s unfortunate that … we hear these great promises of housing, and when the rubber hits the road, they aren’t there to help these guys.”
Mr. Bouchard is also calling for a 20-year term instead of refinancing with a private lender after 10 years.
Alex Hemingway, senior economist and analyst at the Canadian Centre for Policy Alternatives think tank, agrees that government needs to step up its housing game, but without the reliance on private developers.
He says that while any market rental helps, the private market cannot deliver the scale of affordable housing required. Mr. Hemingway, who studies economic inequality, recently published a report on the dire need for government to acquire or contribute more land for affordable housing.
Homeowners who’ve enjoyed windfall gains can pay more in taxes, he suggests, which could go toward the acquisition of public land, especially in low-density detached-house areas where developers aren’t competing.
Once built, the rental housing would pay for itself through rents, instead of the owner making a profit.
“We have been through decades of a sort of austerity, certainly a roll back or a freezing of investments in new social programs – a big withdraw from public investment in housing, a weakening of public-sector capacity in various ways,” Mr. Hemingway said. “So I think there might be a lack of imagination that needs to be overcome.”
There are those with a major stake in the current system who might not like it, he adds.
“If we got serious about this and we are building 10,000 or 20,000 units a year of not-forprofit or public housing in this province, that would begin to squeeze out some of the private developers. So there’s an entrenched interest there, and then there’s the homeowner lobby, and that’s significant.”
Mr. Hemingway, a life-long renter, until recently had lived with his partner in a cramped 330-square-foot attic suite in an old house. It’s the type of rental that many middle-income households are occupying in order to live in the city. But market rentals, even those deemed below market, are unaffordable to many.
“I think market rental addresses the needs of people like us, who have decent incomes but don’t have family housing money and aren’t going to be able to buy a house or an apartment. It’s middle-income housing and we should be realistic about that and recognize what it is.”
He cites a Coriolis Consulting report that goes deeper into land acquisition without forking out for hefty market prices, such as local governments negotiating for land parcels when they approve large rezoning projects, instead of the usual cash or amenity contributions. These land parcels would allow for stand-alone, below-market rental projects.
Another approach is through TransLink, which has potential density around transit infrastructure. The agency would have to broaden its mandate, but according to the report, it’s been done in Seattle and Los Angeles.
It cites the potential of extra land around or above civic properties, such as community centres, libraries and schools. There are significant provincially and federally owned properties that could go toward truly affordable housing.
Land isn’t the only consideration: Concrete construction adds considerably to rental cost. Coriolis cites the difference between rent for a developer-owned onebedroom apartment, built out of concrete, on high-cost land, at $2,970 a month. A one-bedroom built out of wood-frame construction, run by a non-profit, drops to $1,813 on high-cost land.
If there is no cost for the land, the rent drops to $1,357 a month.
The report says that commitment to a large public housing portfolio is a question of political will, and major capital, and is not likely to happen any time soon.

Full text: In the last Ontario election, roughly one in five ridings had slim margins of victory where the difference between the elected candidate and the runner-up was less than five percentage points. Many of these close calls are still races to watch for the 2022 election.
We crunched the numbers and found that in some ridings, the margins were quite significant.
Here are what some of these slim margins from 2018 look like.
SCARBOROUGH-GUILDWOOD 2018 margin of victory: 0.2 percentage points Liberal Mitzie Hunter won by 74 votes. It was the smallest margin of victory in the last election (0.2 percentage points), with the Progressive Conservatives finishing second. It was also a three-way race, with the difference between the winner and the third place NDP candidate at less than 10 percentage points.
Ms. Hunter won by a razor’s edge amid a massive Liberal collapse that booted the party from government and left it with just seven seats in the legislature. Polls suggest support for the party has rebounded and Ms. Hunter has the advantage that comes with serving at Queen’s Park. She won the riding handily in 2014, with more than 50 per cent of the vote. Her main challengers this time are the NDP’s Veronica Javier, a social worker and community advocate, and PC candidate Alicia Vianga, an entrepreneur who founded a charity to help breast cancer survivors.
THUNDER BAY-ATIKOKAN 2018 margin of victory: 0.3 percentage points In Thunder Bay-Atikokan, the NDP won by 81 votes. This riding had long been Liberal until the NDP’s Judith Monteith-Farrell picked it up in 2018, defeating Bill Mauro, a cabinet minister who had held the seat for 15 years – another casualty of the collapse of Liberal support under Kathleen Wynne. (He went on to win the mayor’s job in Thunder Bay that fall.)
Ms. Monteith faces PC candidate Kevin Holland, a businessman who is mayor of the Thunder Bay-area Township of Conmee, and Liberal Rob Barrett, who has run several community service organizations, including an emergency shelter.
BRAMPTON CENTRE 2018 margin of victory: 0.3 percentage points NDP’s Sara Singh, the party’s deputy leader, won over her PC rival by just 89 votes.
Brampton is seen by all three parties as a battleground, with the party leaders making frequent visits here on the campaign trail.
This time Ms. Singh faces new PC candidate Charmaine Williams, the first Black woman elected to Brampton City Council (in 2018) and Liberal Safdar Hussain, a lawyer who runs a real estate business and who placed a distant third in 2018.
OTTAWA WEST-NEPEAN 2018 margin of victory: 0.3 percentage points Ottawa West-Nepean was another riding with a three-way race in 2018. The difference between PC Jeremy Roberts and runner-up Chandra Pasma of the NDP was 175 votes.
Veteran Liberal cabinet minister and former Ottawa mayor Bob Chiarelli had held the seat until 2018, but finished third and about three percentage points behind the front-runners. (He is now running for mayor again.)
This time around, Mr. Roberts faces a rematch with Ms. Pasma, a researcher with the Canadian Union of Public Employees. The Liberal candidate is Sam Bhalesar, a senior communications adviser at Natural Resources Canada.
DON VALLEY WEST 2018 margin of victory: 0.4 percentage points Defeated Liberal premier Kathleen Wynne hung onto the seat she had held since 2003 by just 181 votes. Her party was reduced to just seven seats and denied full party status, but Ms. Wynne stayed on as her riding’s representative until the legislature was dissolved. She is not running again.
Her replacement as Liberal candidate in this keenly watched riding is Stephanie Bowman, a veteran of senior roles in the financial industry who has served on the board of the Bank of Canada. The Progressive Conservatives are running former Toronto police chief Mark Saunders.
The NDP candidate is Irwin Elman, whose post as Ontario child advocate was eliminated by the PCs.
Defeated Liberal premier Kathleen Wynne hung onto the seat she had held since 2003 by just 181 votes.
BRANTFORD-BRANT 2018 margin of victory: 1.1 percentage points The margin of victory for Progressive Conservative Will Bouma was 635 votes.
Traditionally a Liberal seat, the party’s long-time MPP and former speaker of the legislature, Dave Levac, declined to run in 2018. But Liberal Ruby Toor, who is running again, placed a distant third that year.
The NDP have a high-profile new face this time in Harvey Bischof, the former head of the Ontario Secondary School Teachers’ Federation, who clashed with the PC government early in its term over class sizes.
Mr. Bouma faced calls to resign from opposition leaders after a left-leaning website said that before he was elected, he was an executive on a church committee that oversaw a youth magazine that urged young people to reject “the homosexual lifestyle” and supported conversion therapy.
Mr. Bouma responded on Twitter that he was a “proud, loving, and supportive father to a daughter who is a member of the LGBTQ community.”
TORONTO-ST. PAUL’S 2018 margin of victory: 2.6 percentage points Toronto-St. Paul’s was another three-way race in the last election, with the NDP prevailing over the Liberals by 1,345 votes.
This seat, traditionally a Liberal stronghold, was won by the NDP’s Jill Andrew after the riding was rendered an open race by Liberal health minister Eric Hoskins’ decision to step down three months before the 2018 vote.
Now, Ms. Andrew faces a tough fight against Liberal Nathan Stall, a doctor who sat on the province’s COVID-19 Science Advisory Table and became a prominent critic of the PC government during the pandemic. Running for the PCs is Blake Libfeld.

Full text: When rivers spill over their banks, the resulting damage is not simply the result of nature’s caprice. It is also determined by how many homes, farms, roads and hospitals people built in a flood’s path.
A new analysis by The Globe and Mail has discovered that of 150 Canadian communities with populations greater than 10,000, more than 30 have at least onetenth of their buildings within river floodplains. This analysis was facilitated by new flood maps covering the entire country released by the University of Western Ontario.
Chilliwack, B.C., stands out: More than 18,000 buildings in this metropolitan area lie within the floodplains of the Fraser and Vedder Rivers. That’s nearly half of all buildings in the city – no other community we studied comes close. High River, Alta., which saw thousands of homes damaged in a 2013 flood, emerged as another community with extensive floodplain development.
Time and again, construction on floodplains has been exposed as an expensive habit. It can condemn cities to painful cycles of devastation and rebuilding, at great financial and psychological cost to affected residents.
This was demonstrated dramatically just west of Chilliwack, in the Sumas Prairie, a known floodplain inundated last November following a dike breach.
The federal government and British Columbia expect to incur recovery costs of $3.9-billion from the November floods, nearly all of which will ultimately be paid by federal taxpayers. That’s the largest disaster recovery charge in Canadian history – and it’s on top of what homeowners, farmers, businesses and municipalities must pay out of their own pockets.
Additional public funds are sometimes spent on massive flood protection works to protect vulnerable neighbourhoods after the fact. The federal government is also contemplating a program to facilitate relocating homes and businesses from at-risk areas, which might require yet more public spending.
Yet despite official policies at multiple layers of government that seek to restrict development on floodplains, some cities continue to allow it. Meanwhile, as Earth’s climate warms, footprints of many floodplains are expected to expand.
How to defend or abandon such places could become an increasingly pressing dilemma for all levels of government – as will the question of who should pay when past permits lead to tragedy.
GAPS IN THE ARMOUR The City of Chilliwack’s flood maps largely corroborate the University of Western Ontario’s. Indeed, a 2007 municipal map depicts a substantially larger floodplain, mainly because Chilliwack’s maps depict a more severe flood than Western’s. But there’s a crucial difference: The municipal map classifies most of the sprawling floodplain as “protected.”
That’s a reference to the 50 kilometres of dikes surrounding the city, defending tens of thousands of residents, businesses, water lines, railways, the TransCanada Highway and a hospital.
Diking began as early as the 1860s, when settlers inundated the area. Impetus for more dike construction and upgrades was provided by major floods from the Fraser River in 1894 and 1948, and in 1975 from the Vedder River.
Those dikes provided reassurance that were crucial to Chilliwack’s growth. Development originated on the north side of what is now the Trans-Canada Highway, but spread south to encompass the former communities of Sardis and Vedder, and up the surrounding hillsides.
Recently Chilliwack has been among Canada’s fastest-growing cities, its population up 12 per cent in the 2021 census compared with 2016. The total now exceeds 113,000, and municipal officials expect continued growth in the coming decades.
Daryl Moniz, a realtor and president of the Chilliwack and District Real Estate Board, said affordability is pushing home buyers to Chilliwack. “They want the detached home with the white picket fence dream for their family, as opposed to the condo living that’s the reality for a lot of first-time home buyers in the Vancouver area,” he said.
Finding room for that growth, though, is a challenge. Chilliwack is hemmed in by provincially protected agricultural lands and neighbouring First Nations. Demand for many thousands of new homes led to intensification of existing neighbourhoods on the valley floor, as well as some development on nearby hillsides.
Chilliwack’s official community plan only discourages development in the handful of areas deemed “unprotected.” It’s part of a pattern seen in cities across the country: Dikes attract more development, thus floodplain exposure increases.
In Chilliwack, Mr. Moniz said, the floodplain is a “minor to irrelevant” consideration in real estate transactions. “It’s just a way of life, more or less, in western B.C.”
The problem is that flood defences can fail, and their maintenance is often neglected.
Chilliwack’s history proves the point. As serious flood conditions developed in 1948, locals just east of the city belatedly realized their dikes needed to be raised. According to one contemporary account, they “pressed their own trucks into service, turned a 10acre pasture into a gravel pit and formed the nucleus of an army of 3,500 men.”
Those last-minute efforts spared Chilliwack and its surroundings from complete inundation. Dikes nonetheless failed and several neighbourhoods flooded, most notably in the Mennonite community of Greendale on the Sumas Prairie just west of Chilliwack, which became a lake 34 feet deep.
“Following the Greendale break,” the account notes, “Chilliwack took stock of its own defences and found them wanting.”
And not for the last time. A 2015 assessment published by B.C.’s Ministry of Forests, Lands and Natural Resources noted many dikes around Chilliwack were “presently too low,” or else had other deficiencies.
The past decade has seen continuing work to upgrade the dikes, beginning in eastern Chilliwack and moving downstream along the Fraser River. Officials told The Globe the work might take another decade or more to complete, and depends in part on federal and provincial funding becoming available.
Officials fully realize what’s at stake. A 2009 study by engineering firm BGC Engineering estimated potential damages from a major flood of around $1-billion.
“The consequences of a breach in the City flood protection system would be extensive,” a 2016 municipal report noted. Once nearly half a city is in a floodplain, though, backing away can be prohibitively difficult and expensive.
“We are not starting with a blank page, and have to work with the City as it was developed in years past,” Mayor Ken Popove said in a written response to questions.
In addition to diking, the city dredges sediment from the rivers every two years. Several decades ago, it prohibited living spaces on the main floors of residences within the floodplain, so that space is occupied in newer structures by garages, storage and rec rooms.
Gradually, such rules are changing the city’s appearance and reducing risks: In established neighbourhoods, 1960s bungalows sit alongside newer, much taller two-storey homes.
HOW CLOSE IS TOO CLOSE?
Each floodplain community has its own unique story, but they often have similar plot twists.
Ryan Ness, director of adaptation research at the Canadian Climate Institute, said many Canadian cities were established along rivers because they offered transportation routes for goods, drinking water and a source of mechanical power for mills. “Development started next to the water and branched out from there,” he said. “So, we had a lot of development in place before the notion of not building in a floodplain as a good idea became widespread.”
Land use planning has come a long way since the 19th century.
Today, legal restrictions are imposed on the location, scale, density and type of buildings allowed in flood risk areas. Those areas are often mapped based on estimated “return period” of certain floods, which help determine the margin of safety.
Different communities chose different levels of protection. A common standard is the 100-year flood, meaning one that has a 1 per cent probability of occurring in any given year.
But many municipalities, engineering firms and flood mitigation experts regard that as a bare minimum; most urban areas in
Canada protect themselves to a higher 200-year standard, according to a 2016 report by the federal Parliamentary Budget Officer. On the high end is the Red River Floodway, which protects Winnipeg to a 700-year standard.
Despite such rules, some communities nevertheless choose to increase their exposure. A couple of years ago, the Canadian Climate Institute analyzed building permits within the City of Vancouver. It found that during the three-year period between 2017 and late 2020, 10 per cent of the building permits issued by the municipality were for new structures within a 100-year floodplain.
Flood mitigation experts provide various reasons for such behaviour, but they boil down to conflicting priorities and perverse incentives.
From a municipality’s perspective, allowing floodplain construction leads to additional property taxes and development fees. “There’s immense pressure on municipal governments to approve development of all kinds, because it’s their source of revenue,” said Dan Henstra, a professor of political science at the University of Waterloo. “Vacant land is taxed at a low rate, highly developed land is taxed at a higher rate.”
Jason Thistlethwaite, a professor in Waterloo’s environment department, said some municipalities deliberately ignore floodplain maps. Developers also hire consultants to challenge the official maps in a manner “that sort of meets the municipality’s requirements, so they don’t need to be concerned about that exposure.” Provinces often have rules restricting floodplain development, but lack authority to compel municipalities to follow them.
When neighbourhoods flood, municipalities rarely shoulder most of the resulting financial burden. Typically, someone else pays the bulk of recovery costs – individual homeowners, the insurance industry or higher levels of government, through disaster recovery programs.
All considered, experts say, the temptation for local officials to rubber-stamp permits can be irresistible.
“From a probability perspective, a flood is not likely to happen in the term of office of the folks who make these decisions,” Mr. Ness observed.
A FLOOD OF REGRET?
Dr. Thistlethwaite said many municipalities “have been burying their heads in the sand” about the hazards of floodplain development. But the risks are becoming increasingly visible, and not just when neighbourhoods are inundated. Flood maps are increasingly becoming available and accessible. Moreover, overland flood insurance markets continue to develop, so more homeowners may find out from insurers that their homes lie within known floodplains.
He also warned that yesterday’s permits could become targets for tomorrow’s litigation.
“There hasn’t been a discussion of who’s going to own this legacy liability,” Dr. Thistlethwaite said.
“That, to me, is one of the million-dollar questions.”
There’s public support for holding municipalities accountable. According to a 2016 survey conducted by Dr. Thistlethwaite and his colleagues, 64 per cent of respondents thought governments should compensate property owners for flood damages if they allowed owners to build in high-risk areas.
“They were the ones that issued the permit,” he said.
“They’re the ones that declared that land safe for development.
They can certainly be held liable.”
ABOUT OUR ANALYSIS To understand the scope of floodplain development across Canada and identify cities with the highest exposure, The Globe acquired nationwide floodplain models from the University of Western Ontario. The data was created by a team led by Slobodan Simonovic, and was released late last year on the web.
Western’s flood models cover the entire country using a consistent methodology. To our knowledge, they’re the first such maps made publicly available in Canada. However, readers should be aware that the maps have significant limitations.
To begin with, Western’s models only cover river (also known as fluvial) floods. They do not consider pluvial floods (surface water flowing toward rivers) or coastal floods. The maps also don’t distinguish between unprotected areas and those defended by dikes or other infrastructure.
Moreover, Western’s data is low resolution: Floodplains are delineated in blocks covering one square kilometre each. For this reason, our results likely overstate risks in small communities, such as Arctic hamlets of a few hundred people where most structures are located near river banks. In contrast, most localized flood studies are conducted at much higher resolutions – say, blocks of 30 square metres.
Partly to counteract this tendency, we performed our analysis using one of Western’s 100-year floodplain maps. (Dr. Simonovic’s team also calculated 200-year flood levels, which is a more common regulatory standard for mapping and protection across Canada.)
Western produced four maps depicting the size of current floodplains, and eight others that capture projected changes expected due to climate change. We selected a map based on runoff data for the period from 1980 to 2019 – that is, we relied on historical data rather than future projections.
To assess how many buildings exist within floodplains, we cross-referenced Western’s map with Canada-wide building footprints produced by Microsoft Corp. Using ArcGIS Pro, a geographical information systems software package, we calculated the total number of buildings within floodplains in each of Canada’s roughly 150 census metropolitan areas (CMAs) and census agglomerations (CAs).
(According to Statistics Canada, a CMA is one or more adjacent municipalities with a combined population of at least 100,000, which is centred on a population centre known as a “core.” This geographical unit was created for studying large urbanized areas; they’re usually known by the principal city forming their core, such as Toronto, Calgary or Halifax. CAs have populations of more than 10,000.)
We were then able to calculate the proportion of their buildings located within river floodplains in each CMA or CA.
To verify accuracy, Dr. Simonovic said he compared his flood models with official floodplain maps in six Canadian cities. “Our level of accuracy based on these six different cities is 82 per cent,” he said. “This is considered to be very high for a global type of model.”
In some cases we were able to compare Western’s maps to others produced by provinces or municipalities. Sometimes they matched closely, as in Chilliwack.
High River is a different story: Official maps agree with Western’s that much of the town is within the floodplain, but disagree on the outline of the floodplain.
Montreal, however, offers a vivid example of how Western’s data can diverge strikingly from official sources.
Western’s maps depict the entire northeastern portion of the Island of Montreal as a river floodplain. Consequently, our analysis identified more than 130,000 buildings at risk in that city – a result that also placed Quebec as the province with the largest proportion of its buildings in floodplains.
But official flood maps tell an entirely different story.
Nicolas Milot is a research adviser in the Montreal Metropolitan Community, which has been mandated to map floodplains throughout the Montreal area. He said Western’s flood data in Montreal is simply incorrect. He pointed to Mount Royal, the small mountain immediately west of downtown Montreal. A portion of the mountain appears to be in the floodplain on Western’s map.
But it’s more than 200 metres above sea level, he said.
In Longueuil, where Mr. Milot lives, there are hundreds of houses depicted in floodplain areas in Western’s maps that are 50 or more metres above the St. Lawrence River. Conversely, in SainteMarthe-sur-le-Lac, areas at known risk of flooding don’t appear as such in Western’s maps.
“It is not a good representation of the reality,” he said.
The Montreal Metropolitan Community’s maps, recently produced at a much higher resolution, show far more modest exposure to flood risks on Montreal Island. For this reason, we set our results for Montreal aside.
In conducting our analysis, we consulted Dr. Simonovic as well as Emilie Rabeau, senior community engagement specialist with Esri Canada.

Full text: MARKET FORCES Stacey Devoe, a Halifax real estate agent, noticed the increase in calls as early as 2019. The calls came from people who wanted to escape highpriced real estate markets in Ontario and British Columbia and find cheaper, better alternatives in Nova Scotia.
The arrival of the pandemic a year later drove the trend to another level. Freed from having to be in Toronto or Vancouver offices every day, remote workers from other parts of Canada suddenly discovered the appeal of living by the Atlantic.
In showing properties to people outside Halifax, “we often get asked, ‘What’s the internet like?
Is it fibre optic?,’ “Ms. Devoe says. For many potential buyers, it’s a crucial question because they are continuing to work from distant offices.
Exactly how this remote-working trend will play out is one of a multitude of questions hanging over Canada’s real estate market.
It may be a more important question than people realize.
A recent working paper from economists John Mondragon of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and Johannes Wieland of the University of California, San Diego, argues that more than half the real estate boom in the United States over the past couple of years was the direct result of the shift to remote work.
To be sure, Canada and the U.S. differ in many ways. Both countries, though, have experienced remarkably similar takeoffs in real estate prices since the start of the pandemic.
In the case of the U.S., a buying frenzy from December, 2019, to November, 2021, drove home prices 23.8 per cent higher, the researchers note. In Canada, a similar frenzy drove prices 25.2 per cent higher, according to the Teranet House Price Index.
The easiest way to explain these near-identical real estate experiences is to point to the simultaneous fall in interest rates in both countries. Unfortunately, this explanation carries dire implications. If home prices boomed in Canada and the U.S.
because of falling rates, they will nearly certainly tumble as central banks hike interest rates.
But what if a big chunk of those gains isn’t so much about interest rates as about remote work? Then the future becomes more uncertain – but potentially more positive for property owners.
In the best case for homeowners, rising rates may not have as much impact as expected if the trend to remote work is driving much of the recent home-price gains and that trend continues to pick up pace.
Granted, there are many possible scenarios here, because remote work has a dual effect on real estate trends.
First, it encourages people to move from high-priced cities to less expensive locales. This is what Ms. Devoe is seeing in Halifax.
Second, it encourages prospective home purchasers to buy bigger homes than they otherwise would, whether they are changing cities or staying put.
People who expect to work remotely – or to participate in a hybrid arrangement that requires them to show up in the workplace only a couple of days a week – have good reason to upsize their housing requirements to accommodate a home office.
Mr. Mondragan and Mr. Wieland attempt to separate these two effects of remote work in their paper. They argue the first effect – people moving to cheaper cities – may be important for local economies but doesn’t by itself move the dial nationally.
From a countrywide perspective, the faster home-price growth in cities that attract remote workers is offset by the slowing homeprice growth in the cities they leave.
The researchers are more interested in the second factor: the desire for more housing in total as a result of remote work. After working through some intimidating math, they conclude the increased desire for space raised U.S. home prices by a stunning 15.1 per cent during the pandemic – considerably more than half the total increase in home prices during that period.
Their results suggest the recent boom is rooted more in fundamentals than in financial speculation. If the trend to remote work reverses, home prices could tumble, the researchers write.
Conversely, if remote work continues to gain in popularity, home prices could enjoy some unexpected support.
Canadians may want to ponder these thoughts. With many real estate markets cooling, all eyes are now on interest rates.
The researchers’ findings suggest that remote-work trends may be just as important.
The future of the remote-work trend could have particularly big consequences for cities, such as Halifax, that attracted large numbers of remote workers during the pandemic. From December, 2019, to November, 2021, home prices in Nova Scotia’s capital boomed 49.1 per cent, according to Teranet.
The question now is whether such red-hot markets will grow even more heated if remote work becomes permanent practice or cool off abruptly if people return to the office. The percentage of employees working most of their hours from home surged during the early stages of the pandemic, but then levelled off to around 23 per cent by late last summer, according to Statistics Canada.
Ms. Devoe doesn’t sound worried. Her phone continues to buzz with inquiries from people in Ontario and British Columbia, many of them intent on working remotely. “We have ocean, beaches, trails, a slower pace of life,” she says. “People are pursuing the dream.”

Full text: In the past 30 years, Vancouver has added enough people to its downtown peninsula to fill up a city the size of Prince George or Port Coquitlam.
About 69,000 new residents moved into the towers and occasional row houses that sprouted everywhere after the city aggressively promoted a downtown-living strategy, more than doubling the area’s 1991 population of about 48,000.
That kind of transformation is about to hit Vancouver again – only bigger and more far-reaching – as city council prepares to approve sweeping plans that will remake many parts of the city in the next 30 years.
“It does feel like a time of generational change,” said Gordon Price, a former city councillor who was frequently the political advocate for the 1990s plans and continues to analyze city planning. “It’s building for a new generation in a new way.”
And it’s going to be even more of an adjustment for Vancouverites than previous remakes, Mr. Price said, because of how the plans will not confine new development to former industrial land or relatively empty pockets, as has been the case in the past.
Back then, he said, development was kept well away from the 80 per cent of city land that has been reserved for detached houses (except for, in recent years, a few small incursions such as basement suites or laneway houses). In a “grand bargain” that worked politically for many years, any new density was piled into developments in the other 20 per cent.
“We are going to move away from the grand bargain and see the transformation of the legacy city,” Mr. Price said.
The promise of such a big change is provoking a fierce debate. Many younger people who feel shut out of everything but dingy basement suites and overpriced studios are in favour of anything that seems to make more room for them. They’ve been joined by non-profit housing representatives, YIMBY advocates and organizations ranging from the VGH and UBC Hospital Foundation to the local francophone association and business owners.
But the many plans for the city’s future have also generated a wave of discomfort, anxiety and outright opposition among others, including former premier and Van- The man couver mayor Mike Harcourt, former city planners and var- the city’s ious resident groups in both also ge the east and west sides of the wave of city. anxiety a A new civic party, TEAM for a Livable Vancouver, is al- oppositi most entirely focused on the others, issue, raising questions about former p how much new housing is re- Vancouv ally needed and what form it should take.

groups i “This is clearly a genera- east and tional change. This kind of of th shift started when we became one of the most unaffordable cities, after the Olympics,” said Theresa O’Donnell.
The Broadway Plan, now being debated at council with a decision likely next week, envisions adding 50,000 new residents and office space to almost 500 alreadydense blocks surrounding the central Broadway corridor, where a subway line is going in.
The Vancouver Plan, due to be voted on some time ny plans for before the Oct. 15 civic election, goes even further, profuture have posing a miniature town enerated a centre around the Oakridge discomfort, mall and denser forms of and outright housing in the many commercial high streets around ion among the city, but also relabelling including the detached-house zones premier and as “multiplex” zones.

All of that is in addition west sides to the mega-projects being he city. planned in various areas of the city, from Indigenousled developments at Jericho Lands, Heather Lands, UBC and Senakw in the west to the BC Housing remake of Skeena Terrace and a real-estate investment trust’s redevelopment of the Safeway site at Broadway and Commercial in the east.
If the Vancouver Plan is passed as proposed, it could produce the kind of neighbourhoods often seen in the central areas of older North American cities – a blend of detached houses, row houses, duplexes, triplexes, possibly sixplexes and small apartment buildings.
All of that represents profound and, for some, uncomfortable change in Vancouver.
The streetcar lines of the 1920s created a housing boom and the city expanded rapidly, but that created little backlash because it was all on empty land.
The city councils of postwar Vancouver, with city manager Gerald Sutton-Brown at the helm, opened the doors to redevelopment of the West End, turning it from a neighbourhood of former mansions converted to rooming houses to a mix of towers and low-rise apartments. A few taller towers in other areas – West Point Grey, Kitsilano, Langara – were also allowed during that period.
The 1970s saw the new TEAM council, backed by activist neighbourhood groups, ban taller apartment buildings in residential neighbourhoods, which was widely approved by voters of the day, if not renters.
At the same time, council introduced the novel concept of redeveloping industrial land for denser central-city living at South False Creek – again, land with no one on it or nearby who might complain.
And the post-Expo 1990s brought about the modern, condo-filled downtown peninsula, with a couple of megaprojects elsewhere, as well as some new options for four-storey apartments on commercial streets.
The ideas in the Broadway Plan and the Vancouver Plan are coming forward now because all the easier options have been used, said Dan Garrison, the city’s senior housing planner.
He and his colleagues see it as both a practical move and a more equitable one than those of the past.
“A lot of the growth before has been in the areas where low- and moderate-income people live,” Mr. Garrison said.
City planners say the housing needs to go to areas that are already rich with parks, schools and community centres and have been seeing their populations drop.
“You can’t let those neighbourhoods hollow out. It’s too big a part of our land base,” Ms. O’Donnell said.

On Alberni Street, the luxury buyer is back: Stagnant since 2018, the high-end real estate market in Vancouver’s West End is showing signs of recovery

Full text: Vancouver’s multimillionaires’ row on Alberni Street is picking up steam again after a lull in the luxury West End market these last few years.
Since 2018, the West End condo market had slowed, particularly at the luxury and ultra-luxury end. But as the world slowly returns to normalcy, and immigration and tourism with it, the downtown luxury market is ready to do business again, says developer Kevin Cheung, chief executive officer of Landa Global Properties.
The company has invested heavily in Vancouver’s Alberni Street power corridor with three projects, including a pair of passive house 43- and 48-storey towers at 1468 Alberni St. An entire city block of apartment and office buildings will make way for the heritage-style towers, designed by New York’s Robert A.M. Stern Architects, with Vancouver MCM Partnership. His 1650 Alberni tower, in partnership with Asia Standard Americas, is being designed by SOM, the architects behind the One World Trade Center in New York.
When interviewed a year ago, Mr. Cheung said developers who had projects to launch had put them on hold. He described the mood as one where developers were cautiously waiting and wondering who’d have the courage to launch first.
This year, the mood is a little different and so he is one of the first to launch presales for his 1818 Alberni project, which had been on pause.
“With the immigration and tourism coming back and people coming downtown, we wanted to basically put our project into the market,” said Mr. Cheung. “We’re confident in the market, but it’s not a proven market yet. We are not in full-on recovery where everything is coming back and there’s lots of product launching.
We’re not there yet. But we have so much in the pipeline in the Alberni corridor, so we need to get going.”
Mr. Cheung said other developers who haven’t launched their marketing efforts yet are in a holding pattern, waiting for buyers to return.
Bosa Properties’ 1515 tower, designed by German architect Ole Scheeren in part of a global trend for “Jenga”-style high-rise buildings, launched last fall. It came just after the launch of Jim Pattison Developments’ 2 Burrard Place.
As for other luxury projects in the West End, Mr. Cheung says, “they haven’t launched, but I know they are in the planning stages. During our market meetings, [marketer] Bob Rennie presented a bunch of figures of all the projects that have potential to launch in the next year. There are a lot of players in the same boat in terms of waiting to go.”
Two weeks ago, Mr. Cheung began previews for 1818, a 21-storey, 54-unit boutique tower designed by Rafii Architects. It is one of the shorter buildings because it’s near Stanley Park, and it caters to the sort of buyer who appreciates an exclusive view and a RollsRoyce car service. The price is $2,300 to $2,400 per square foot, and as of last week Mr. Cheung had already sold about 18 units in the building. Those prices are conservative compared with prepandemic, he said.
Initially he’d planned to build two units per floor, but because of the pandemic downturn he reconfigured the floor plates to include two smaller two-bedrooms and one three-bedroom that takes up half a floor. To his surprise, the three-bedrooms have been selling fastest, with starting prices at $3.8-million. The twobedrooms start at $1.8-million.
“For a project downtown, having 2,000 square feet, half a floor plate, is very rare,” he explains. “I don’t think you’ll get this offering again on Alberni Street, except for penthouses. To have a stack of large three-bedrooms with water views is very unique.”
Alberni Street has had luxury retail for years, but in terms of housing it’s now a newly emerging multimillionaires’ row. It’s becoming the show pony for elaborate architecture and equally decadent lifestyles. Mr. Cheung says the transformation was largely the result of the city’s West End Community Plan, which covers the area on the downtown peninsula between West Georgia, Burrard, Stanley Park and English Bay.
Andy Yan, director of Simon Fraser University’s City Program, said that the median household income in the West End is only $51,000.
“I think in the West End Community Plan they put all the tallest densities on Alberni Street and a bunch of sections that don’t have social housing requirements. The city designated the street as being very high end,” Mr. Cheung said.
“I’m sure you have heard about comparisons to Rodeo Drive, where Alberni starts off at one end with luxury brand retail and a small segment of residential and it ends with Stanley Park, so it’s a very limited offering. With the heights and basically with building policy, we had to show leadership in design and sustainability, and it led to all these ‘starchitects.’ That’s how it formed.”
As for the buyers, Mr. Cheung said he didn’t know about the demographic, but he believed that they were end users, not investors.
The pick-up in the luxury market, however, also coincides with increased immigration and tourism, which indicates that foreign wealth is driving the market.
Condo marketer George Wong, principal of Magnum Projects, said the downtown market slowed in 2018 and continued to stall for the next several years, with a bit of pickup in the fall of 2020. By 2021, developers began launching projects that had been waiting on the sidelines. The luxury market isn’t quite where it was, but the expectation is that it will gain momentum.
Mr. Wong marketed Three Harbour Green more than a decade ago, and the penthouse that sold then in the $11-million range is now listed for $49-million. The market for that type of home is extremely niche, however.
“That is for the super, super, super wealthy. … There are very few people on this planet who can afford that, and that calibre of people are people who don’t even live here full time. It’s a second house.”
Last summer, he marketed 2 Burrard for $1,900 per square foot, and that project did “exceedingly well,” Mr. Wong says. There are degrees of luxury in the West End, he says.
“The luxury condo would be the $2- to $5-million price range, and high luxury would be in the $5- to $12-million price range. I would say the luxury price range under $5-million has done decently, but it’s not back to where things were in 2017. The high luxury market still has to find its way back, because we are missing the super wealthy. And COVID had stopped a lot of the international travelling. But once that opens up again … Canada is so sought after for living purposes and for kids’ education purposes, for just safety purposes.”
Very few locals can afford that type of product, he says.
“Even our high luxury-market product is cheap [for international buyers].”
In order to attract investors to 2 Burrard, they lowered the prices and made the suites smaller.
“There was a lot of anxiety about how people would react to downtown, so at 2 Burrard we had 239 homes and we wanted to make sure we had a good calling card for investors’ budget and appetite.
“Investors had stayed away from downtown for awhile. So we were quite mindful and really concerned about it, and not sure if they would be back. … We wanted to be more on the conservative side to test the market, so we also made the suites smaller to attract the investor.”
The result was that more than 65 per cent of the project sold to investors.
“That’s pretty healthy. We were very happy with how it turned out.”
Once China emerges from lockdown and those buyers return, the downtown market should pick up even more, he said.
Buyers from around the world buy in Vancouver, but China is the key global buyer: wealthy buyers with disposable capital.
And foreign wealth drives the super-high-end towers that are arriving downtown, said Mr. Wong. That’s been the phenomenon for about 15 years. Although Chinese cities are in lockdown, those buyers are still finding a way to buy properties in Vancouver.
And for those very wealthy buyers, many of the homes are secondary properties, not primary residences, he says.
“A lot of people from China are not able to travel, but once that gets relaxed, we are going to see a large influx. People are finding ways to send money over here.
Living in China has not always been a poster boy of livability, right? And Vancouver is very attractive. Some are getting their money out and buying without coming here.”

Full text: 252 Diiorio Circle, Ancaster, Ont.
ANCASTER Asking price: $2,249,900 (February, 2022) Selling price: $2,405,001 (February, 2022) Taxes: $9,560 (2021) Days on the market: Two Listing agents: Shannon Sullivan and Tobias Smulders, Re/Max Escarpment Realty Inc.
THE ACTION This four-bedroom house occupies a 45- by 146-foot lot in affluent Ancaster, midway between Toronto and Niagara Falls. Local buyers were the first ones to visit after its launch in February. Within 48 hours, one buyer edged out two rivals with a strong overasking offer.
“To be on the market for such a short period of time is unique,” said agent Tobias Smulders.
“We priced it close to market value, not super low to generate multiple offers.”
WHAT THEY GOT This two-storey house with a double garage was built about 10 years ago. It has 3,664 square feet of living space and a finished basement with double doors to a rear patio, hot tub and salt-water pool.
The formal dining room has vaulted ceilings. The two living and family rooms have gas fireplaces.
Upstairs, the primary bedroom has the luxury of two walk-in closets and the largest of the home’s four bathrooms.
THE AGENT’S TAKE “That area is quite nice and is a central commute to Toronto,” Mr. Smulders said.
“The property is unique in that it backs onto conservation land, so there’s nice green space behind it, and it has a pool too, which for summers is quite sought after as well.”
The home was also bought with numerous builder upgrades. “It was quite premium in terms of quality of construction,” Mr. Smulders said.
“It had an upgraded kitchen and … most ravine lots have walkout basements, but this one was extra tall with more windows, so it seemed brighter.”

The perfect spot for conservationists: Rural Ontario property is home to threatened flora and fauna, but current owners have worked with experts to remove invasive species

Full text: 422 Mountsberg Rd.
FLAM BOROUGH, ONT.
Asking Price: $3,750,000 Taxes: $3,770.21 (2021) Lot Size: 16.3 acres Agent: Karen Lilja, Re/Max Escarpment Realty Inc.
THE BACKSTORY When Alba DiCenso and Brian Hutchison bought their home at 422 Mountsberg Rd., they were looking to get out of Hamilton for a little more quiet reflection. They have that in spades with more than 16 acres of trails, ponds, wetlands, forest and pasture clearings. What they weren’t expecting, but have enthusiastically embraced, is a conservationist mission that seeks both to enhance the natural landscape and support some of the threatened local species of flora and fauna.
The lot is almost right in the middle of a triangle of mainly rural land between Hamilton, Milton and Guelph. This is equestrian country; satellite maps show a halfdozen oval tracks within a couple kilometres of the home. Initially, the couple invited the local conservation authority onto their property for advice on where to site a gazebo they hoped to build.
“We didn’t know anything about these things when we moved here,” Mr. Hutchinson said. “Once we connected with them we had an annual visit. … They’d look around and point out things we should consider doing. And then we began to learn all they could do to help us. Up until last year, we had a grant to remove large [nonnative] buckthorn trees and poison them so they wouldn’t come back. They brought extractors, dug out all sorts of trees. We’ve had at least four tranches of trees and shrubs they’ve provided to us.”
That partnership has allowed them to enhance and improve the property in sometimes unexpected ways over the years.
“In one of our walks, an expert pointed out a big patch of periwinkle, an invasive plant,” said Ms. DiCenso. Periwinkle, though non-native, does provide a pretty blue forest carpet, and so it was with some reluctance that they brought in a team to uproot it all.
“I was astonished. … Within the next year, we had a forest floor filled with [local species] trilliums and bloodroots, trout lily and mayapples. … It’s such an excellent example of what happens when you get rid of invasive species.”
They also heard from conservationists that bluebirds were endangered, so they allowed a collection of nesting boxes to adorn a clearing where they put a picnic table. They also have five duck boxes along the stream, for wood ducks and hooded mergansers, which lay upward of 17 eggs in a clutch that are often preyed upon by raccoons.
And as it turns out, if you take care of nature it can take care of you.
“Four of our 16 acres are conservation land, it’s wetland area, and that’s eligible for 100-per-cent tax exemption,” Mr. Hutchinson said. “The other 11 acres get reduced taxes for managed forest. … Our taxes here are less than $4,000 a year.”
THE HOUSE TODAY Down a winding lane through thick forest is the house at 422 Mountsberg. It sits near the rear of the rectangular lot, and close to Mountsberg Creek, which runs through the property.
Originally, there was a cottage on the land with an addition that was built in 1971.
The couple hired custom-home builders Thomas Cochren Homes and architect John Williams of Williams Residential Design to reimagine the structure. The cottage wasn’t salvageable, but the addition was mainly kept, and that footprint was converted into a wing containing the primary bedroom and living room.
“When [Mr. Williams] designed the house, he wanted to ensure we’d have a beautiful view from every window. … Sixteen years later, I find myself wandering from window to window,” Mr. Hutchinson said.
It’s a ranch-style home with red siding and white trim, and the outbuildings have the same cladding. Through the half-glass front door is a foyer tiled in slate that leads directly into the formal dining room. On the left is a door down to the large unfinished basement, on the right the closet, and then hallways branch off at 90-degree angles. The same warm, golden oak flooring is found everywhere but the bathrooms in the rest of the house.
Down the hall to the right is what might be called the guest wing. There’s another central foyer here that opens into five separated spaces: an office, two bedrooms, a powder room and a full bathroom. The office feels like the biggest room with its double French doors and large bay window, but it’s actually smaller in size than the two bedrooms, both of which have windows on two walls.
The guest bath has a tub-shower and large vanity and storage cabinets; the powder room is right next to it and only has a vanity and toilet.
The kitchen is through a doorway from the central dining room, also accessible from the hallway and the living room, and is a separated space with a large eat-in area and a wall of windows. A U-shaped run of counters (with bold red upper and lower cabinetry) contains the double wall oven, gas range and double sink that faces the wall of windows. The fridge is on the shared wall with the dining room, next to a shorter run of cabinets and counter with a second prep sink.
Turning left out of the kitchen is the living room, with a large fireplace with a brick-and-wood mantle on an interior wall and almost floor-to-ceiling windows on two sides. Every major room has large windows that draw the forest closer and flood the space with light.
Going back to the interior of the house is a section of the T-shaped hallway that connects the foyer, the kitchen and the primary bedroom. Off that hall is also a mudroom entrance with laundry, pantry and a secondary fridge and stove, which is very helpful for cooking the polenta for big Italian family get-togethers according to Ms. DiCenso.
“That’s what I grew up with; there’s usually multiple things that need to be in the oven at the same time – a baked pasta dish, and a turkey or a ham.”
The primary bedroom also has windows on two walls, and about a third of the floorplan is dedicated to the large walk-in closet and ensuite bathroom. It has a separate shower and tub, double vanity and one feature that’s a little unusual: a wall-mounted urinal next to the toilet.
“It was a strong request that Brian had when we designed this house. And I must say that all the men who visit and see it are very impressed,” Ms. DiCenso said.
THE BEST FEATURE Without a doubt, the woods.
“I take a 20-minute walk around the property every day,” Ms. DiCenso said. “I go up the sugar maple forest to the picnic area, down the hill to the coniferous forest, and then walk along a lovely slope parallel to the road, then a trail that takes me into the wetland, streams, over a bridge to the pond, a walking path along along the stream, and then back home.”
In the winter, they will sometimes crosscountry ski or snowshoe the same route.
“We spend time on the pond, on the dock, often for a drink in the afternoon,” she said.
One of Mr. Hutchinson’s retirement projects was to build a sugar shack to make that most Canadian of condiments.
“This year I made 30 litres of maple syrup,” he said. “There are 42 taps on plastic tubing, but there’s potential for lots more because it’s quite a large sugar maple bush.
I have a 65-gallon collection tank that drains into a wood-fired evaporator, and it’s become a slick operation now.”
In August, Mr. Hutchinson turns 80, and while it’s too late in the year to get one last syrup batch, the couple hopes to host one last big party to wish a sweet goodbye to their forest home.

Full text: As a child, Drew Facey demonstrated a flair for design that was far ahead of his years. This gift would eventually lead to a dazzling career in theatre, where he transformed many an empty stage into a unique set for actors. By the time he was approaching his 40s, Mr. Facey had become known for enriching historical settings with contemporary touches such as a modern leopard-skin couch set within the room of a 1930s play. His bold vision became much in demand.
Mr. Facey worked on almost 170 productions across Canada, ranging in style from operas to musicals to the works of Shakespeare. He won 18 Vancouver-based Jessie Richardson Theatre Awards, including one in 2014 for Significant Artistic Achievement for his entire body of work.
“Adventurous” is a word frequently used by colleagues, family and friends to describe Mr. Facey. He travelled the world eschewing predictable tourist spots in search of the extraordinary, which often included the gritty. He once referred to his eyes as “greedy,” meaning he craved the unusual and striking. He sought out original lines, colours and shapes, saw beauty amid squalor and vice versa.
To his discerning eye, a peeling vase found curbside could be the perfect complement to a $20,000 table. Mr. Facey might well have spent his entire career in theatre, but the COVID-19 pandemic propelled his life in a new direction. In 2020, as one theatre contract after another was cancelled, and tired of dry spells between work, the intrepid Mr. Facey and his long-time partner, Kelly Murphy, decamped from Vancouver to Merida, Mexico.
Revelling in the beauty of the city’s colonial buildings, thriving cultural life and local markets, the two men embraced a new beginning despite having only a smattering of Spanish. In preparation, before leaving Canada, Mr. Facey mastered a complicated 3-D software design course and obtained work with Decorilla, an online interior-design service based in New York.
In an interview published on the site he said his “must-haves” for private clients were books, art and plants and that one wasn’t enough. “Wherever I go these three [items] are sure to follow.
These elements not only bring life and personality to any space but also provide opportunities to showcase a homeowner’s individual taste and style. I’m fascinated by our relationships with our homes and how much our spaces affect the quality of our lives,” he said.
After extensive renovation to a historic house in the central area of Merida, Mr. Facey and Mr. Murphy’s lives seemed idyllic. Assisted by Mr. Murphy, whom he married in 2020 and who functioned as an administrative assistant, Mr. Facey’s Drew Facey Designs was becoming known for excellence. Then Mr. Facey began experiencing difficulties with his digestive system. It was a particularly cruel complaint since he adored spicy foods, excelled at cooking, and was much admired by friends and family for his ability to recreate sumptuous dishes from the many countries to which he travelled with Mr. Murphy.
Complications from his illness brought on a cardiac arrest in Merida, where Mr. Facey, aged 41, died on May 11.
The idea of Merida as home for the couple was planted as a seed after viewing an episode of a television series that featured a couple of Canadian expatriates who had moved to Mexico.
Mr. Facey and Mr. Kelley, who investigated real estate wherever they went, had toyed with the idea of moving to Thailand, Vietnam and India but felt they were too far from Canada should a family emergency arise. Merida seemed a good compromise.
“Drew always said that because of the [asteroid] that hit the Yucatan however long ago that it had stardust all over it and that made it feel mystical and special,” Mr. Murphy said. “As soon as we arrived I knew we were in the right place.”
Andrew (Drew) Neal Facey was born on Dec. 28, 1980, in Kelowna, B.C, the first of three children belonging to Neal and Noela (née Krueger) Facey, both teachers. As a Grade 1 student, he precociously drew his house as part of a class project. His teacher remarked to Drew’s parents that if the assignment had not been completed in class she would have suspected he had received help at home.
Aside from drawing, one of his favourite childhood activities was using his sister, Meredith, as an assistant to create stylish rooms out of bookshelves for her Barbie dolls. At the age of 10, he asked his parents for a subscription to Architectural Digest. They obliged.
Christmas and Halloween decorations in the Facey household required precise, perfect arrangements, overseen by Drew.
His parents knew and warmly accepted that their elder son was gay before he officially came out to them in Grade 12. After graduation from Kelowna Secondary School in 2000, the young man set out for Montreal to study English at Concordia University; however, he didn’t find his métier until he returned to Vancouver and studied at the Emily Carr University of Art and Design. This was followed by further studies at Langara College’s Studio 58 Theatre School, from which he graduated in 2006.
In order to support himself through school, Mr. Facey worked at a Vancouver coffee shop called Melriches. Love at first sight filled the air on the day a dark-blond, blue-eyed former employee of the shop walked in. Before long, Mr. Facey, then 21, and Mr. Murphy, 25, were sharing glasses of wine after work.
Two months later, they moved in together.
As a neophyte in the world of theatre, Mr. Facey did laundry, attended to wigs and helped actors change costumes, but it was clear to all who knew him that he wouldn’t stay in a lowly position for long. He had a big presence, a raucous laugh, a generous nature and a tendency to say “Oof.” Ashlie Corcoran, a close friend and artistic director of the Arts Club Theatre, said that, depending on inflection, “Oof” could mean many things.
Christopher Gaze, artistic director of Vancouver’s Bard on the Beach, a prestigious Shakespearean festival, remembered Mr. Facey as “a mass of talent and very ambitious.” During an interview with Globe and Mail western arts correspondent Marsha Lederman, Mr. Gaze said of Mr. Facey, “When you talk to him you feel that almost anything is possible … and won’t it be fun to do it?” Mr. Facey leaves his husband, Mr. Murphy; grandmother, Eva Facey; parents, Neal and Noela Facey; and siblings, Meredith and Kevin Facey.

How Ontario’s housing market has changed under Ford’s government

Full text: When it comes to housing in Ontario, the classic political question of whether you’re better off than four years ago depends mostly on whether you own.
People who had property when the Progressive Conservatives were elected have done very well – at least on paper. Across the province, the price of the average house is up 72 per cent since June, 2018, when the Tories took office, according to data from the Canadian Real Estate Association.
But many people who don’t own a home have started to worry that they may never be able to do so. And renters – 35 per cent of Ontario residents – have seen their costs soar as well.
“Housing affordability has definitely become a top-line election issue,” said Matti Siemiatycki, a professor in the department of geography and planning at the University of Toronto.
A survey done by Nanos Research for The Globe and Mail found that about seven in 10 respondents were dissatisfied or somewhat dissatisfied with the ideas they were hearing from Ontario politicians during the provincial election campaign on how to make housing more affordable.
(Nanos randomly dialled 515 adult Ontario residents, using land and cell lines, recruiting them to participate in an online survey between May 16 and 17. The margin of error for a random survey with a sample size of 515 is plus or minus 4.4 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.)
Although the price jumps were highest in the larger cities, with the average house nearing $1.3-million in the Greater Toronto Area, the knock-on effect has hit a wide swath of municipalities within a few hours of the provincial capital.
This has led to tensions among people displaced from communities they had called home. And some homeowners, while pleased with their windfall, are concerned about where their children might live. Others are perturbed by the inequity of market timing, turning some into millionaires while shutting out the less fortunate.
The question, though, is whether the current government will be blamed.
Progressive Conservative Leader Doug Ford didn’t create the pandemic real estate boom any more than he controls interest rates. And although the numbers are a little different in each city, real estate has been on a tear in many parts of the world.
The Tories can argue that they formed a housing affordability task force, though they ignored its most controversial recommendation to allow more housing units on residential properties, and that they increased the foreign buyers’ tax and expanded it to cover the whole province.
Mike Moffatt, an economist and senior director of the Smart Prosperity Institute, acknowledged those moves but said they came late.
“I think they could have done that sooner. … I think they may have been a little bit slow on this issue,” he said.
“I don’t think there’s much you can point to in their actions that caused [the housing market] to be where it is, but I think you could say, okay, they probably could have acted faster and maybe, had they, we wouldn’t be quite where we are today.”
A survey done by market research firm Abacus Data for the Ontario Real Estate Association found that 84 per cent of respondents said a party’s ideas for addressing housing affordability could be an important factor when deciding for whom to vote on June 2. (The survey of 1,500 Ontarian adults was conducted between May 5 and 8.
According to Abacus, the margin of error for a comparable probability-based random sample of the same size is plus or minus 2.53, 19 times out of 20.)
As they campaign, politicians have to walk a contradictory line on housing. They need to offer hope to young people, immigrants and other would-be purchasers who desperately want prices to fall. But they also need to reassure existing homeowners that they won’t do anything to bring down prices.
The main parties are leaning heavily on the supply issue and promising to make it easier to build homes. But other than the Greens, the parties are unwilling to take on homeowners, a demographic that votes, by forcing city councils to loosen zoning rules.
The Tory housing force recommended doing so, allowing up to four units on any residential plot in the province. However, the government’s subsequent housing bill did not pursue this idea, with the housing minister saying that more collaboration with municipalities was necessary.
Prof. Siemiatycki sees political calculation in the Tories’ hesitancy on this file. He contrasted it with their bulldozer approach on various issues early in their term, including their determination to cut the size of Toronto city council, and argues the pullback on zoning was a strategic move aimed at shoring up votes.
“I think that was a signal that they’ve reached the end of what they felt was electorally possible,” he said.
“These were policies that were going to have a political impact, not just in the 416 [Toronto area code] and especially in the downtown core, where this government doesn’t have a strong electoral base, but was going to start to shift into the [suburban] 905, where this government got elected last time and where elections in Ontario are won and lost.”

How are Canadians coping with soaring gas prices?: Many are driving less or strategically planning their trips, while others are cutting back on discretionary spending

Full text: With gas prices recently soaring past $2 per litre in much of the country, Canadians are feeling the pinch.
Oil and gasoline prices have been on the rise for much of this year, particularly since the Russian invasion of Ukraine in late February. Even as oil prices levelled off somewhat, gas prices continued to shoot up in recent weeks because of surging demand amid the pandemic recovery, outpacing refining capacity.
They pulled back Friday, just ahead of the long weekend, but remain near all-time highs.
In previous run-ups, motorists would grumble and carry on.
This time around, the $2 mark is obviously a pain point for many, forcing them to adjust their driving and spending habits amid a broader surge in inflation. Many are driving less, cancelling excursions or strategically planning their trips, while others are cutting back on general discretionary spending to offset the higher cost of gas.
Consumers have increasingly been searching for fuel-efficient vehicles and more are choosing to downsize, said Cody Green, co-CEO of Canada Drives, an online retailer based in Vancouver.
Canada Drives noticed a sudden shift in buying this month, putting smaller cars ahead of SUVs. “Historically it was 1:1 cars to SUVs for sales, but in May we’ve seen cars selling 25 per cent more than SUVs,” Mr. Green said.
Calgary resident Derek Dukelow downsized his SUV in January due to rising gas prices and switched to a 2016 Ford Fiesta, which he uses to drive to work.
He has also put off going to the movies – a favourite pastime – to reduce expenses and has cut the number of camping trips with friends this year from a planned 10 to four, because of the twohour drive.
“It’s taking away some of the enjoyment. Even just going for a drive to the mountains used to raise my spirits, and now I ask: ‘Should I save that gas?’ ” Mr. Dukelow said, adding that it has been stressful. ”Us blue-collar workers are not getting any richer. It’s an anxiety-inducing time.”
Lori Kalemkerian, a Toronto resident, has cut back on plans to visit her family in Michigan and New Jersey this year. She’ll be making just one trip instead of the multiple trips she had planned.
“I feel like I’m still being limited from seeing them because the gas is so prohibitive,” she said.
“Family is important – they’re everything.”
An avid online shopper, she has also cut down on that spending as well.
A recent survey by DesRosiers Automotive Consultants found that almost two-thirds of Canadian drivers are driving less owing to rising gas prices. About 22 per cent said they’re driving “a lot less,” and 41 per cent said “a little less.”
Canadians in rural areas are looking for any way to avoid long trips.
“If we need milk or groceries, we no longer just make that trip into town. We wait and go without until a major grocery haul a week or so later,” said Kerry Taylor, a financial strategist in Okanagan Valley, B.C., whose closest reasonably priced grocery store is 45 minutes away in Vernon.
“Our little hay farm has a budget of $3,000 a year in diesel, and now it’s closer to $6,500. That’s doubling our price to make hay,” Ms. Taylor added. “So suddenly we’re analyzing how much we have to price the hay just to break even. If we can’t make hay, then the horses don’t have food or the livestock. So this trickles down to food prices … because my expense just went up 50 per cent. You need fuel to make food.”
North Battleford, Sask., resident Evan Vaughan says he has cut back on visiting friends and family in other provinces and has avoided travelling to the mountains for recreation in order to save the $150 fill-up for his SUV.
Driving is unavoidable in the Prairies, he noted, where communities are spread out and public transit is often minimal. It has become unaffordable for some people in outlying areas to get to towns or cities, so they end up paying more for food in small local stores. He has also noticed more hitchhikers recently.
“It’s always been cheap out here, but now the cost of living is skyrocketing,” Mr. Vaughan said.
Even simple pleasures are now prohibitive for some. Kim Stoodley, a resident of Surrey, B.C., who is on a fixed budget and between jobs, used to drive to get a coffee each day, but now only takes her car out every few days. When she does, she buys four cups of coffee and places three in her fridge for the following days. That helps her cap her weekly gas bill to about $25 a week.
People who want to drive less are also looking for properties closer to public transit, said Adam Hoffman, a Toronto real estate agent at Property.ca Inc.
And realtors themselves are feeling the pinch, narrowing the territories they cover and referring some clients elsewhere, Mr. Hoffman said.
The gas-price surge is likely to make public transit systems, which have been filling up as the pandemic eases, even busier. According to a 2021 study by the Canadian Urban Transit Association, when gas prices increase 10 per cent, ridership increases 1.44 per cent.
Automotive experts have been offering tips for saving fuel, such as avoiding idling and the excessive use of air conditioning.
Heavy loads and jack-rabbit acceleration also waste gas, as do improperly inflated tires. Other tactics include completing all your errands in a single run and carpooling with friends and family when possible.
Fuel-price surges also mean a growing curiosity about electric vehicles.
“Whenever there’s a spike on gas prices, the readership on all of our articles about EVs and hybrids spike too,” said Mr. Green of Canada Drives. “Customers say it’s driven by fuel prices more than any environmental considerations.”

Canada’s baby boomers are leaving behind tons of stuff. Are their kids ready for the Great Junk Transfer?

Full text: Last fall, Kevin Cameron stood in the doorway of his parents’ two-storey saltbox home in the woods on the South Shore of Nova Scotia, the place he’d built with his dad when he was a teenager and woken up to during snowy family Christmases with his own kids. The silence felt like a punch in his gut. For the first time, his mother was not coming around the corner to greet him. His father was not in the basement, tinkering with an engine. He had died that summer after a stroke at the age of 87, and his mom, 81, was now in a nursing home, losing her memory of the house. Yet the rooms of the place were just as they’d always been, as if his parents were only running errands in town.
Wandering through the house, he saw the kitchen shelves loaded with bowls and dishes, rooms crowded with furniture, books and knickknacks, closets packed with clothes, drawers stuffed with toothpicks and razors, a full set of mouldy encyclopedias on a shelf. His dad’s workshop was filled with tools, machine parts, cardboard boxes of greasy washers. There were sheds in the backyard cluttered with chainsaws and bikes and broken microwaves, along with a 1950s backhoe his father had insisted he inherit, even though Mr. Cameron, an artist, has absolutely no use for it.
This was only the beginning. After a long search, Mr. Cameron would eventually find the registration for his parents’ car – which he now had to sell – inexplicably buried in a plastic bag stuffed with unused Christmas cards, the kind that charities send in the mail. There were keys that matched no locks. Sales receipts that went back to 1948. His parents had kept everything and thrown out nothing.
How could a house that felt sorrowfully empty also be so overwhelmingly full?
“And then it hits you,” Mr. Cameron says, “all the work ahead.” He saw the months of lost weekends, the five-hour round trips he would have to make from his own home in Greenwich, in the Annapolis Valley. This was the inheritance he never wanted: a burden that would rob him of time, just when his dad’s death was reminding him, at 58, of his own mortality.
Anger and resentment sliced through his grief.
Why had his parents left him with all this mess?
Over the next 10 years, Canadians will inherit an estimated $1-trillion – the largest transfer of wealth in history. But all those investment portfolios and real estate assets being passed on by aging parents will also come with piles and piles of stuff with nowhere to go.
The parents of baby boomers, the oldest generation alive today, were savers, having learned in the lean times of war and the Great Depression to treasure what they owned. Their children were consumers. Together, they will leave behind houses jammed with mahogany dining room sets, silver platters, crystal figurines and all manner of tchotchkes that their kids don’t want. And, even if they did want them, this Great Intergenerational Dump is happening just as millennials are facing a housing crisis, which will leave many of them either renting or living in much smaller homes.
Grandma’s massive china cabinet is not going to fit.
So what’s the result? A booming business for junk companies willing to take it all away. An exponential growth in storage lockers that are never emptied. Endless Saturdays of garage sales and trips to the landfill. An exhausting cycle of cluttering and decluttering. For every painting you’d fight your siblings for, there’s a Hummel collection – the one your parents said, “would be worth something someday” – that’s going in the garbage. Because, let’s be honest, we all already have too much stuff as it is.
Sorting, culling, and tossing all that “accumulation of life,” as the junk experts call it, makes for lucrative business. According to an investor presentation this month, Storage Vault, the country’s largest publicly traded storage business, went from owning 10 locations in 2014 to 197 in 2022 – with a combined capacity of 10.8 million square feet of space. The company’s share price has soared from 50 cents to more than $6. The association of Professional Organizers in Canada, which started in 1999 with 30 people, now has 600 members ready to help with the handwringing over those cherished Royal Doultons.
Five years ago, Deb Darbyshire, co-owner of the Calgary franchise of Just Junk, estimates that she’d get a call once a month from adult children looking for help cleaning out their parents’ home. Now, she picks up a new job roughly once a week. About one-quarter of the families tell her: “We don’t want
any of it. Take it all.”
But as Kevin Cameron discovered, there’s an emotional challenge to dealing with the treasure and trash that your parents leave behind. It’s not easy to throw away these pieces of them.
“What if, once they died, and we got rid of their stuff, I could never find my parents again?” worries Julia Ridley Smith in The Sum of Trifles, a collection of essays about cleaning out her parental home.
Sons and daughters who have faced the chore describe wrestling with how to do it properly, respectfully and fairly (also cheaply and quickly) while ghosts hover. The whole process shakes awake buried sorrows, sibling rivalries, family dysfunction. It is never just about the the stuff.
“It’s just so easy to be immobilized by what to do with some stupid thing you wouldn’t even give a second thought to if you saw it on the side of the road,” says Lori Walker, who cleaned out her parents’ home with her sister in 2019. Now when her friends mention the same task lies ahead for them, “I feel my stomach turn over.”
If it was just junk, it would not be so hard. But possessions have meaning; they tell stories and reinforce our memories.
How we treat the stuff of past generations – and how we divest our own belongings to the people we love – offers a lesson in what we value too much and perhaps don’t value enough. What matters in the end? What endures? That’s the challenge: what to take – and what to leave behind – when you close the door on your parents’ home for the last time.
One afternoon, in Perth, Ont., Danielle Robichaud and her mom, Donna, sat on the floor of Donna’s home, trying to sort through a pile of her late father’s possessions, when they came across the award plaque.
Donna, planning a move closer to her daughter, was determined to downsize properly; when her husband died in 2013, she had moved most of his belongings from British Columbia to Ontario. It had been too hard to part with them then, but now she was ready to let them go – with Danielle’s permission. Danielle, an archivist at the University of Waterloo, would drive up on weekends to help her mother keep what mattered and discard what did not.
The wooden plaque – bestowed on Danielle’s father at a car show – was unexpectedly complicated.
She didn’t want it, but she felt torn: Her dad had cared enough to save it. Donna, having already carried around a box of bowling trophies for more than 30 years, wanted her daughter to decide its fate.
As an archivist, Danielle is an expert on stuff.
She thinks like a curator who, faced with only so much space, has to be cutthroat about what will hold its future value. Letters and diaries are golden because they reveal a person’s thoughts and character. But a trophy is a title without a story, unable to say what made someone a good bowler or why they loved cars. Its value peaks at the moment of delivery, then steadily diminishes, gathering dust in the back of a closet, until a decade after the recipient’s death, it’s dead weight in your daughter’s hands, headed for the trash. “It just becomes this thing filled with a lot of guilt.” Danielle knows it wasn’t rational. But “I felt badly throwing it out.”
What was the most precious item that she brought home from her father’s stuff? His favourite mug that she now uses for her morning coffee.
“There is something deeply comforting about drinking from it,” she says.
That’s another common theme that emerges: what your loved ones will save of you may be the last thing you imagine. Not the china tea pot or the crystal bowls, but the scratched-up cooking tray you used to make their favourite squares, the Corningware the family took camping; the twist of driftwood you found together on the beach one summer – items that fall into the categories of useful, portable, original and wrapped in nostalgia.
But dividing up objects isn’t easy, unless siblings can work together. “I said many times that when mom and dad go, it’s gonna be a bloodbath,” says Lori Walker, who worked for five months with her sister, Sandy, to clean out their parents’ home in Victoria. “As it turned out we were a spectacular team.”
Sandy, a retired therapist, credits that to the two sisters working on their relationship before their mom died. Otherwise, she says, “it just takes one person to say, ‘I’m going to back off. I’m going to let go of this.’ ” The pair also tried to respect their different emotional responses. Lori saw that it was painful work for her sister, who compared the job to disturbing a memorial. When the owner of a local consignment store came to the house to assess their mom’s beloved antiques, Sandy wept with relief that they’d found someone to treat the furniture with reverence and care. But Sandy also made room for Lori’s frustration – like when her sister needed to vent about why their mother had left them to deal with the dusty collection of PetroCanada drinking glasses, or their dad’s work shed cluttered with lidless plastic containers and old spoons.
Since Lori, an instructor at Capilano University, had to travel from the mainland, the larger load fell to Sandy, who lived in Victoria. She found people to take the jigsaw puzzle collection, donated the freezer to the food bank and arranged for a charity to send their father’s tools to El Salvador.
Over the weeks that they worked on the house, they created piles for recycling, for garbage, an entire room for the stuff that was TBD. When they both wanted an item, such as a vase, they would put it on the floor and collect all the vases, then take turns choosing. For the most part, their contrasting tastes worked in their favour. In the end, they agreed to share one item: a plastic plate filled with coloured sand that looked like ocean waves when tilted, which had fascinated them both as little girls. It was not, Sandy notes, one of the items her mother had stamped with a sticky note that read: “This might be valuable.”
Both Lori and Sandy understand why families get a junk company to just take the stuff, especially when you live far away, when the job is too overwhelming. But Sandy also says that sorting through your parents’ things, if you have time and energy, can result in special moments – bonding with your sister, or finding a card you once gave your mom, scrunched in the bathroom cabinet, on a day when you are especially missing her. (That card is one of the possessions Sandy describes when asked for a special item she saved from the house.) Meanwhile, Lori came home with duffle bags of coins and stamp albums, now stored in her basement, saved for the prospect of a buried treasure. She will go through them, she says. Someday.
For both sisters, finally closing the house felt like freedom. “It didn’t finish the grief,” says Sandy, “but it was like, oh, now I can breathe differently.”
Donna Robichaud, 65, has begun to feel that same lightness, as more stuff leaves her house. It’s amazing how quickly you forget the very item you hemmed and hawed about giving up. Still, culling your own life isn’t easy. “It does take a few steps to get there,” she admits. When considering an item’s fate, she asks: how does this fit in with who I want to be – what I want to do – during the time I have left?
She also cringes when she hears her friends say they are leaving the job to their kids. “I think that’s selfish. I look at my own house, and if somebody told me I had to pack it all up because someone died, it would be exhausting and I would be angry.”
It can also make an old grief painfully fresh.
Rachel Berman’s parents had been planning to downsize when her mom became ill and died. Her father refused to leave the house after her death or change anything inside it. So, years later, Dr. Berman, a professor at Toronto Metropolitan University, and her brother were left to sort through their family possessions when her dad died in late 2020.
Packing up her mom’s things felt like losing her a second time. “The wound was ripped open for me, like boom, here we go again.”
Life is unpredictable – parents need to move into a home sooner than they think, an illness takes its terrible course, a pandemic complicates the usual business of grieving and settling affairs.
For Brenda Thompson, a writer and publisher in Perrotte, N.S., cleaning out her parents’ trailer was hindered by leaky pipes and an ice storm. She started in March – she remembers stepping into the cluttered home and feeling physically sick – and has been going nearly every day since. “It feels like we are in an ultra marathon; one problem gets fixed, another one pops up.”
She’s already thinking about all the “crap” she is hanging on to for no reason. “When I finish with Mom and Dad’s house, I might as well keep right on going, and start in the attic of my own home,” Ms. Thompson says.
The hardiest of offspring will persevere, whatever the mess. Nine months after his father died, Mr. Cameron figures that he and his wife, Beth, are about one-third finished.
The house pulls at him, like a heavy chain.
“Compared to what is going on in the world, this is nothing,” he says. But if his parents had settled their own affairs better, “it would have made my grief easier.” And protected his memories of them.
He has a ritual now, each time he leaves the house in the woods – a way, he explains, “of detaching myself from the resentment, the sorrow, the questioning.” He puts on the security system and locks the door on the stuff that still needs sorting. “See you, Dad,” he whispers. “I miss you.”
So sit your parents down, Mr. Cameron advises, and have The Talk before it is too late. Giving away your worldly possessions isn’t easy: it means living in a universe that is shrinking, not expanding. But there can be meaning and purpose in that awareness, suggests Laura Gilbert, author of The Stories We Leave Behind.
She wrote the book after cleaning out her parents’ home forced her to consider her own possessions in a different light: Were they treasures or burdens? More importantly, when her kids opened the door to her house when she was gone, what story will she have left them? She began to think of her belongings as auditioning for a part in the movie version of her life, and at workshops, she coached people to wander through their homes, like members of a film crew, and think about the narrative their possessions tell. “If you think about the themes you leave behind, you get to shape those memories,” she says. “By not leaving a disaster, the kids walk in knowing what was important to you.” Also, she points out, children who can wander through a carefully curated home are less likely to crumble on the doorstep and call the dumpster company.
