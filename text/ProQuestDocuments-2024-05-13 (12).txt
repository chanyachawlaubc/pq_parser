Asking price: $529,000
Selling price: $530,000
Previous selling price: $343,000 (2008)
Taxes: $2,759 (2008)
Lot size: 25 by 119 feet
Days on the market: one
Listing agent: Linda Ing-Gilbert, Re/Max Hallmark Realty Ltd.
With little inventory available across the city, buyers are quick to move on properties, such as this semi-detached house, which sold on the day it was listed by agent Linda Ing-Gilbert.
"It's just an indication of how crazy the market is," she says.
However, in comparison to properties averaging 16 or 17 feet wide and 100 feet deep, this one had the benefit of a spacious L-shaped lot more than 25 by 119 feet. "It's hard to come by all that land," Ms. Ing-Gilbert says. "And it had a premium western exposure."
The secluded grounds accommodate a long four-car driveway, garden shed and backyard surrounded by tall trees. "It was a Muskoka-like oasis in the backyard," the agent says.
The size of the property also allowed for a large two-storey plan with three bedrooms and three bathrooms, plus a rear addition off the kitchen with a powder room and double doors to the deck.
"It was fully renovated with a main-floor family room, which is in high demand," Ms. Ing-Gilbert says. "It's very rare to have that."
The sellers revamped the recreation room in the basement, which has one of two full bathrooms and a side entrance. In addition, new stainless steel appliances, air conditioning system and roofing were installed within the past year.
Other features include hardwood floors throughout, from the living and dining area to the bedrooms upstairs.
Local amenities include East Lynn Park, Danforth Avenue restaurants and subway access.

Full text:   Since Marlene Colquhoun raised the curtain on the renovation of her historical home, festival talents looking to rent have been knocking on her door, Deirdre Kelly writes
In a town where plot is king, Marlene Colquhoun's own Stratford story could be called stageworthy, especially as it is mainly theatre people banging on her door - literally - to experience it.
They include Simon Callow, the acclaimed British actor and director who last year rented a Gothic revival house owned by Ms. Colquhoun on Cobourg Street, a short stroll from the Tom Patterson Theatre where he was starring in his own one-man play inspired by the sonnets of William Shakespeare.
A local home and garden consultant by profession, Ms. Colquhoun had renovated the historic 1867 property so beautifully that Mr. Callow (Gareth in the film Four Weddings and a Funeral ) referred to it as "heaven on Earth" throughout his time there.
This year's tenant is Stratford Shakespeare Festival dramaturge Robert Blacker, no doubt also enjoying the 1,200-square-foot home's antique-laden interior and covered porch, where there is a divan for lounging or reading a book.
The attraction isn't hard to fathom.
After buying the house five years ago, Ms. Colquhoun wanted to preserve history, some of it her own, so she took care when renovating it to create an ambience imbued with drama, love and loss.
She had grown up in the neighbourhood - her grandparents once owned the property two doors down, where her father had been born and raised. And while she says she finds design influences in magazines and on trips abroad ("I have a good eye," she says, "I enjoy looking at things, and wherever I travel I'm obsessed with the architecture, the paint colours and the gardens"), in this case she drew inspiration from her own memories.
"I remember what the street looked like 50 years ago," she says, pouring glasses of lemonade recently on the home's veranda. "I wanted to recapture that moment in time."
The reason is largely personal: At the age of 12, she moved to New Brunswick from Stratford after the Canadian National Railway closed its shops there in 1964, causing many local families with deep roots in the area to leave town in search of work.
While out of province, she eventually married and raised three children, always dreaming to one day return to the place of her birth.
Seven years ago, her offspring having flown the nest, she finally felt free to make the move with her chiropractor husband back to Stratford, eventually chancing upon the Cobourg Street property.
"It had everything going for it," Ms. Colquhoun recalls.
"It had all the original windows, baseboards and doors. And it was authentically historic, having been designated by the Ontario Heritage Act."
The only thing missing, you might say, was Ms. Colquhoun's signature touch.
To get it, she and her husband completely gutted the home - the original baseboards and door casings removed and restored as part of the renovation - before rebuilding it from scratch.
Part of the redesign included installing new plumbing, wiring and heating ducts, as well as a new furnace, roof and interior joists to replace some that had started to rot.
The couple also removed a wall in the front hall to provide for a bigger entrance and make room for the addition of a main-floor powder room fitted with a refurbished drainboard sink that originally had been in the kitchen.
The ceilings on the main floor were already high (in excess of nine feet) and were kept intact while gaining embellishment in the form of exposed beams.
"I wanted to leave exposed the floor joists and boards from the upstairs because they were the kind of thing you don't see much of any more," Ms. Colquhoun says. "They are so beautiful, made of pine, and likely cut from the forests that surround Stratford."
The upstairs originally had three bedrooms plus a bathroom, but Ms. Colquhoun changed the floor plan to accommodate two bedrooms, each with its own ensuite bathroom.
In one of the new bathrooms, she recycled the old rolled rim cast iron tub that had been part of the original house when, more than a century ago, it belonged to Douglas McTavish, a schoolteacher.
Downstairs was an old sunroom that wasn't insulated and had fallen into disrepair. Ms. Colquhoun tore down a side wall to open it up to the kitchen, adding laundry facilities.
In the creamy white kitchen, she installed custom maple cabinetry as well as antique pine furniture - much of it locally sourced - and a chandelier original to the house.
"I believe that even in a small house it's important to create a feeling of luxury," Ms. Colquhoun says. "Each room has a chandelier, and I think making the entrance way larger instantly imparts a luxurious feel, as you feel bathed in air and space."
She and her husband lived in the home for two years before deciding to rent it out to guests of the Stratford festival.
They are currently renovating the house they recently bought next door, also a historic property.
She's just started the process and can't yet determine what the result will look like.
"I'm waiting to see what it wants to tell me," she says. "Often these old houses do that. They speak to you, letting you know just how they want to be."

Full text:   His signature project was Meadowvale, in Mississauga, an early planned community
Peter Langer embodied a rare mix of militaristic discipline and Mitteleuropean courtliness. Both traits came in handy in a storied five-decade-long career as one of Canada's most prolific real estate developers.
Mr. Langer rode the crest of Ontario's real estate boom from the 1940s through to the 80s, developing millions of square feet of residential, commercial and industrial properties, and serving on a slew of industry associations.
But his signature project was - and continues to be - Meadowvale in Mississauga, one of the first and most successful integrated, or "planned" communities in North America.
Once 1,200 hectares of barren farmland in the Town of Streetsville, which was folded into Mississauga in 1974, Meadowvale was inspired by the earlier planning success of the Don Mills community in northern Toronto, which integrated homes, offices, schools, industrial parks and shopping.
For Meadowvale's master plan, Mr. Langer envisioned those and more, and built them all: Complete head office campuses, recreation facilities, hotels, parks, even a conservation area with two man-made lakes, fishing, nature trails and bicycle paths.
To top it off, housing co-operatives and public housing projects with rents geared to income were mixed in with single-family homes. It was self-contained and architecturally controlled, meaning it was Mr. Langer's company, Markborough Properties Inc., that approved all the buildings in the development.
More than 40 years later, Meadowvale anchors the explosive growth of regions west of Toronto and remains a model for planned communities across North America. The key to its success, Mr. Langer told The Globe and Mail in 1984, was the interrelationship of business parks and residential areas.
"Companies wanted to know that there was a variety of housing types available so that staff could live nearby and even walk to work," he explained. "We created a network of parkland and trails enabling employees to go through the whole community without even crossing a major road."
Friends and family recalled an urbane, well-mannered man with rakish, leading-man looks and loads of quiet charm, but also a stickler for precision.
"He was an honest, sincere, dedicated man," recalled Mississauga's plain-spoken mayor, Hazel McCallion, a long-time friend. "He cared about people. He wasn't just a developer who built houses. He wanted to make sure all the amenities were in the community.
"You always knew you were dealing with a man who meant what he said and said what he meant."
His skills in diplomacy, management and organization were forged in the cauldron of European calamity. He was born in Vienna to a German mother and Czech father, a successful businessman who operated farms and coal mines and died when his son was 19.
As a teenager, Peter attended Viennese balls and belonged to the Austrian Home Guard, a conservative anti-Nazi group. When Austrian chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss was assassinated by Nazi agents in 1934, he served in the funeral honour guard.
But when the Nazis marched into Austria in 1938, Mr. Langer's name appeared on a blacklist. Using his Czech passport, he fled to Prague and from there to Paris. After two attempts, he was admitted to England in time to study agriculture at the University of Reading and anglicize his first name from Hans to Henry.
After only a year at school, war broke out. Mr. Langer signed up for service and was shipped to France with the British Expeditionary Force. But when the Germans broke through at Dunkirk, his unit retreated and he found himself back in England.
Half a world away in her native Toronto, Lillian Patterson had won acclaim for posing, at age 18, for a Coca-Cola poster. (The majestic cliffs and pounding surf behind the leggy pin-up girl holding the bottle were Ontario's Scarborough Bluffs.) A dancer, she went on to perform with the famous Bluebell Girls at the Folies Bergère in Paris.
Later recruited by ENSA (Entertainments National Service Association), she too was deposited in England by the war's twists and turns, and when Mr. Langer saw her perform in Wales, he quickly arranged an introduction. Six months later, in September, 1941, they were married.
With his bride doing classified photographic intelligence work at Canada House in London, Mr. Langer returned to soldiering and by 1943, was a lieutenant in Algiers. From there, he was made commandant of an Italian prisoner of war camp.
Serving under the U.S. 5th Army, he landed in Italy, where, by now a captain with proven skills in managing large situations, he was put in charge of hiring civilian labour. Within a year, 50,000 locals had been recruited to renovate factories and produce war materiel for the U.S. and Britain.
His negotiation skills were tested when Italy sought to conscript the workers into its own armed forces.
"I ended up trying to make peace between the chiefs of staff of the Italian army, navy and air force on one side, and the U.S. and Britain on the other," Mr. Langer told the Mississauga News in a 1986 profile.
Eventually, he was placed in charge of all civilian labour in northern Italy before being discharged from the British Army in 1946 with the rank of major. That same year, he and a growing family crossed the Atlantic on a banana boat to Canada.
Settling in east Toronto, Mr. Langer answered a newspaper ad in 1947 for A.W. Farlinger Real Estate, which specialized in industrial and commercial spaces. Within three years, he was general manager, and four years after that, a full partner with his name on the door. Farlinger and Langer branched out into residential developments and built the first air-conditioned office building in Toronto, at 801 Bay St.
He joined A.E. LePage as vice-president in 1960. Five years later, he, his boss and an associate formed Markborough Properties for the sole purpose of developing Meadowvale. The company went public a year later and Mr. Langer never looked back. "At first, builders would laugh at me," he recalled. They probably stopped laughing when Meadowvale became part of Mississauga and would go on to attract 600 companies. Once, while surveying the development from a helicopter, Mr. Langer spied a dimple in the landscape - a perfect spot for a lake, he thought. The five-hectare Lake Aquitaine was born.
Markborough became one of Canada's leading developers, with a hand in office buildings, hotels, industrial parks, shopping centres and planned communities across the country, in several U.S. states and in London, England.
In 1973, the company successfully fought off a fierce takeover bid from Campeau Corp. in Ottawa by bringing in the Hudson's Bay Co. as a competitive bidder. In 1978, Markborough became a wholly owned subsidiary of HBC.
When it was formed, the company had assets of $15-million. By the time Mr. Langer retired in 1986, it was worth about $3-billion. Together with the late Marco Muzzo of Erin Mills Developments and Bruce McLaughlin, who built much of Mississauga's city core, Mr. Langer became known as one of the city's big three developers.
His close work with governments resulted in a motto: "We have government interference but not enough government involvement." His own involvement was extensive: He served as president of the Toronto Real Estate Board, where he put in place new procedures on ethics; the Ontario Real Estate Association and Canadian Real Estate Association, and two terms as president of the Urban Development Institute.
His belief that every Canadian had the right to a decent place to live drew him to the Ontario Housing Corp., where he served for over 10 years; the Metropolitan Toronto Housing Development Corp., the Ontario Seniors Housing Corp. and the Ontario Student Housing Corp.
He made no apologies for being a workaholic. "You either work or you don't make any money," he once said. But it wasn't all toil.
Into his 60s, Mr. Langer drove a 1968 Dodge Charger 440 Hemi muscle car "at somewhat high speeds," his son Paul recalled with a laugh.
And a favourite story revolves around a business trip Mr. Langer made to Berlin around 1956. Teenage girls had surrounded the hotel because the actor William Holden was staying there, but he was unable to make an appearance.
When Mr. Langer walked outside, a colleague remarked loudly, "It doesn't matter. Clark Gable is here instead." Mr. Langer was instantly besieged and happily signed autographs.
H. PETER LANGER
Hans (Henry) Peter Langer was born in Vienna on March 15, 1916 and died in Toronto on Aug. 14, 2009 of natural causes. He was 93. His wife predeceased him in 1995. He leaves children Peter, Paul and Ann, and four grandchildren.

Full text:   THE GOOD A 7.9-per-cent growth rate is the envy of the West; stockpiling and infrastructure have driven the global rebound in commodity prices THE BAD Who's buying? Empty wallets in the U.S. and Europe and thrifty Chinese consumers threaten to choke off the comeback THE UGLY When will Beijing stop boosting inefficient state enterprises and open the credit taps to millions of aspiring entrepreneurs?
Investment banker Ken Courtis has his own personal gauge for determining the health of the Chinese economy, and it has nothing to do with often-questionable government statistics, an overheated stock market or soaring purchases of commodities.
If traffic is light enough that he can make it to five or more meetings a day in the usually choked streets of Beijing or Shanghai, and if people can actually fit him into their schedules, he knows business is bad. Conversely, if he can be squeezed into only two meetings a day, it means business is booming.
And these days? "At the moment, you can do three," says Mr. Courtis, a former vice-chairman of Goldman Sachs Asia. It's as good a signal as any that China's economy is on the rebound.
Reading the Chinese tea leaves has become a prerequisite for global business. Every reported statistic is carefully scrutinized, and every blip - whether up, down or sideways - has the ability to move equity, bond and commodity markets around the world. Quite simply, the planet is pinning its hopes of a recovery from the depths of the worst recession since the Dirty Thirties on China being able to sustain its surprisingly boisterous growth of recent months.
Yet no one, least of all the experts, is sure about the true state of the Chinese economy, or whether it has the ability to carry the rest of the world on its coattails.
On paper, China's economy is blowing the doors off the West. Despite sharply falling exports, it grew at an impressive 7.9-per-cent annual clip in the second quarter from a year earlier, according to government data, and a stunning 15 per cent from the first quarter of 2009. There are predictions China will overtake Japan to become the world's second-largest economy by 2010. Five years ago, that didn't seem likely until 2020 at the earliest.
But China's all-star performance comes with a major-league-sized caveat: Official data are notoriously unreliable. Even the most bullish analysts concede the GDP numbers are flawed. That's because the Chinese rely on lower levels of government to collect the data.
Local officials win promotions based on the figures they produce, so they have a strong incentive to exaggerate. Each level is eager to juice the numbers to please those above.
China's National Statistics Bureau recognizes this and typically cuts the tallied figures, which helps explain why, even in the official statistics yearbooks, the provincial and national figures rarely add up.
The official stats also fail to account for the enormous impact of China's burgeoning underground economy, which includes such services as restaurants and an army of small, illegal mining operations.
Such under-the-radar activity accounts for about 20 per cent of China's economy, says Scotia Capital China analyst Na Liu. But it never shows up in the figures of economic output. "It's like a major city in China never goes shopping, according to the GDP," Mr. Liu says.
Alternative indicators
To get a better read on the country's economic health, China watchers are increasingly turning to alternative indicators to supplement the government stats. They're tracking everything from electricity consumption to satellite images from Google Earth to make their calls on the economy.
What they're finding are reasons for equal measures of optimism and concern.
A massive four trillion yuan ($586-billion U.S.) stimulus package has spurred a deluge of domestic infrastructure projects. Looser credit conditions have spawned a record 7.4 trillion yuan in new loans in the first six months of the year - that's nearly a quarter of China's gross domestic product, and well in excess of the government's own target of five trillion yuan in new loans for the entire year.
As much as one-third of this cheap money has flowed straight into speculative investments in real estate, stocks and commodities. And at least another third has gone to shore up struggling businesses in a tough economic environment. But there has been enough government money sloshing around to trigger fresh growth - and to create furious demand for Western commodities, including copper, iron ore and oil.
But the infrastructure spending and access to easy credit will soon come to an end. And that is where things could get dicey for China's economy.
The government's moves have likely exacerbated the overcapacity and inefficiency issues that have plagued some of China's largest state-controlled industries, such as steel making, that have received the lion's share of the new business loans. At the same time, smaller, more dynamic and entrepreneurial businesses, considered vital to China's long-term economic transformation, have been largely shut out of the government's stimulus and lending schemes.
Meanwhile, long-dormant Chinese consumers have sprung to life amid the current economic renaissance. Sales of vehicles and appliances have soared with the help of government rebates. But domestic consumption won't be enough to sustain current domestic growth once the stimulus measures peter out, let alone drive the global economy the way the American consumer did for so many years.
Daniel Rosen, a partner with the Rhodium Group, a New York-based advisory firm, is concerned that the rest of the world has become complacent about China's growth and "too laudatory" about what China has done to contribute to global recovery.
While China has admirably handled the stimulus element of its economic plan, it has failed to address deep-rooted constraints on the domestic economy. The Chinese remain too reliant on exports: "They haven't made the jump to domestic consumption-driven growth yet," Mr. Rosen says.
Trying to decode the signals from China's hulking economy these days is no easy task. There are legitimate reasons to believe that a rebound is under way - but also signs that it may be fragile and unsustainable, once such vital props as unprecedented government spending and extremely loose monetary policy disappear.
COMMODITIES
No sector has benefited more from China's current financial might. China's aggressive purchasing has almost single-handedly driven an incredible rebound in copper prices and helped keep demand for iron ore and oil strong.
Amid the market meltdown last fall, China took advantage of low prices to stockpile copper in anticipation of the need for the metal used to make wire and pipe that would result from the slew of infrastructure projects. The buying also correctly predicted a pickup in housing construction.
"Looking at the commodities can give you a lot of confidence of where the economy is," says Mr. Liu of Scotia Capital, who specializes in tracking Chinese commodity data as a gauge of overall economic health.
Last winter, when much of the world was bearish on China amid economic statistics indicating a major slowdown due to slumping export demand, Mr. Liu turned exceedingly bullish.
"When everybody was so bearish and thought things were going in the toilet, I talked to local people [in China] and I understood that people were buying copper and molybdenum and coking coal. Talking to these people, you were able to understand the tide was changing even though the macro data was still negative," Mr. Liu says.
In the first six months of this year, China's consumption of refined copper jumped 48 per cent or 1.2 million tonnes. Even Chinese pig farmers have been jumping on the stockpiling bandwagon, storing scrap copper in their barns as a speculative investment.
China's massive steel industry has also picked up sharply, driving demand for iron ore and coking coal.
Mr. Rosen of The Rhodium Group agrees that commodities are a "fairly powerful" indicator, in part because the data is reliable. China's demand for foreign commodities can be correlated with export statistics from producing countries.
"There is no way for China to hide the supply and demand for things like iron ore and oil," Mr. Rosen says.
INFRASTRUCTURE
New roads, bridges, tunnels, railways - they're all getting the green light in China right now.
The bulk of China's $586-billion stimulus package is flowing to infrastructure and there's no shortage of projects. Scores of construction plans that had been delayed during the heady days of 2006 and 2007, when the government was actually trying to temper growth, have now been given the go-ahead.
"The stimulus has simply brought the future expenditures to the forefront," says Michael Deng, a China specialist with Canaccord Adams based in Calgary.
"The reason they can ramp up so quickly is because these projects had already been planned, but over a longer period. Now they are accelerating it."
Infrastructure initiatives create jobs, improve the standard of living in underserviced areas and keep China's economy growing. As long as the money keeps flowing, there's almost no end to potential projects to finance because of China's sprawling geography and underdeveloped system of roads and railways.
LENDING
Credit is easy to come by in China today. The record pace of loans has helped prop up struggling businesses and offered consumers and industry the funds needed to expand.
Loosening credit flows is exceedingly simple in China. Under the state-controlled banking system, Beijing doesn't ask banks to lend. It orders them to. So far, the stimulus has not stoked inflation. In fact, Chinese consumer prices have been falling.
The majority of the record 7.4 trillion yuan in debt doled out this year has gone to state-controlled companies instead of more-vibrant private firms that are expanding at a quicker pace.
Critics argue that China's banks are setting themselves up for a wave of bad debt in coming years that could shake confidence in the country's financial institutions. But others believe that most of the debt has been adequately vetted.
"A lot of the feasibility for the new loans was made years ago," says Scotia's Mr. Liu. "In the past few years, the Chinese government was fighting against overheating, so they killed a lot of legitimate investment projects."
Fears of a U.S.-style real estate meltdown driven by easy mortgages are also overblown, argues Mr. Liu. Chinese home buyers generally put down 30 per cent of a property's value. For a second home, they must put down 40 per cent.
THE TREND
Even if one doesn't believe China's economic stats, the trend can still be a friend. Most China watchers say the data is more than accurate enough to show the overall direction of the Chinese economy, and that is all that really matters.
"There is so much data on the Chinese economy today and so much is integrated with the global markets that while the headline statistical releases from Beijing do generate considerable debate about Chinese statistics, by and large people feel they can gauge the general direction of China's economic movement," Rhodium Group's Mr. Rosen says.
OFFICIAL STATISTICS
To put it simply, many of China's statistical indicators can be extremely opaque. Those that aren't, often don't add up. The most recent example came earlier this month, when first-half GDP figures released individually by China's 31 provinces were 10 per cent higher than the data released by the National Bureau of Statistics.
At a time when the world is looking to China as an engine of growth, the inconsistencies have become a continual source of embarrassment to the central government. Most analysts don't rely on the government-issued numbers.
Take the nearly-useless unemployment stats, for example. The Chinese version measures only local employment and completely ignores the vast numbers of migrant workers, who number about 150 million people - nearly five times the population of Canada. Beijing recently announced that nearly all of the more than 20 million migrant workers laid off earlier this year from their factory jobs had managed to find new jobs when they returned home. But the government didn't explain where it got such good news.
Even the Chinese media is doubting the data. China Daily, a state-backed English-language news outlet, quoted a poll recently that said 91 per cent of respondents are skeptical of the government official numbers, up from 79 per cent in 2007.
THE CONSUMER
Chinese shoppers are definitely spending more, with retail sales growth of 15 per cent in the first half of the year. But they remain frugal by Western standards. Chinese household spending as a percentage of GDP is about 35 per cent, half the U.S. level and well below even the Japanese ratio.
The consumer expansion roughly offsets the decline in export earnings, leaving stimulus spending and public sector investment to account for just about all the current growth in the economy. Private sector investment is noticeably absent, as might be expected when the most profitable part of their business, exports to Western consumers, has fallen off a cliff.
Government largesse is not the recipe for sustained consumer-led growth. That task belongs to the private sector and the jobs it is capable of creating, provided it has access to the capital needed to shift away from exports and ramp up production of goods and services targeted at the domestic market.
To replace its reliance on exports, China is going to have to boost household consumption to 50 per cent of GDP, a tall order in any economy. In China, it will require a dramatic shift of capital and resources that could take years.
"They can't turn themselves inside out overnight," says Mr. Courtis, the Hong Kong-based investment banker.
PERSISTENT OVERCAPACITY
The flow of easy credit to inefficient state-backed entities in sectors like steel and cement has been a setback to hopes of purging China's economy of its less-competitive companies. For China's economy to truly mature, more financing must be made available to small and medium-sized businesses and private companies. Instead, 70 per cent of all loans still go to state-owned enterprises.
Chinese officials said this week that they intend to curb overcapacity in steel and cement, which have expanded as a side effect of the stimulus package, the construction boom and easy credit.
These statements, however, exacerbated concerns that China's commodity consumption is slowing, and the so-called restocking process is now largely complete. Chinese steel prices are falling after months of gains. The head of BHP Billiton Ltd., the world's largest mining company, has warned of sluggish Chinese metals demand.
The fear now being voiced in some circles is that any significant Chinese cutback will send shock waves through world commodity markets and cause prices to crash again. China could, in fact, spur another downturn in resource-producing nations such as Brazil, Russia and Canada.
FEAR OF SOCIAL UNREST
The biggest threat facing China's economy is what happens when the funds from the stimulus package and government loans have been exhausted. The fledgling Chinese consumer can't do the heavy lifting for the global economy, which means that Western demand for China's exports will have to come to the rescue. "I would argue we're probably going to be seeing a W-shaped recovery," says Jennifer Richmond, senior China analyst with Stratfor, a global intelligence firm based in Austin, Tex. "Everything that they're doing really isn't long-term. They're still not addressing some of the root issues."
Within the corridors of power in Beijing, the darkest fear is that economic change will bring with it social instability. In the northeastern province of Jilin last month, a mob of steel workers beat an executive to death after he arrived to tell workers their factory was to be privatized in a takeover that would lead to job cuts.
The paramount need to maintain stability at any cost underlies every economic policy move. It explains why, for example, long before the global downturn, Chinese banks were providing cheap credit to anyone promising to employ people, no matter how shaky their business plan. And it is also the reason Chinese authorities have started fretting about asset bubbles.
The last thing Beijing wants is an inflation problem. "It's so hard to manage social stability when you've got inflation," Ms. Richmond says. "When people can't be fed, that's when you've got a problem."

This detached, two-storey house sold quickly mainly based on the wealth of nearby urban conveniences and natural surroundings, agent Nutan Brown says.
The previous owner - like many neighbours - was a long-time resident on the short street, which is close to local eateries, businesses and live theatre along Bloor Street West, as well as nearly 400 acres of parkland.
"[The street] only has a dozen or so homes," Ms. Brown says. "They rarely come up for sale because of their ... fabulous setting and location."
The pie-shaped lot is also set on higher grounds than adjacent homes and filled out with gardens and mature trees.
"You really don't know that you're still in the city, because you're just immersed in these beautiful huge trees ... and you can actually see High Park," the agent says.
"It's so serene and tranquil that you forget that everything you need - like the subway, library and shops - are all within a five-minute walk."
The house was built about 80 years ago with a three-bedroom plan, though two bedrooms were combined to create a large one with access to a deck.
Rounding out the upper level is a second bedroom with his and her closets, and one of two full bathrooms.
Hardwood floors are in most areas, such as the living and dining rooms. The former features a wood-burning fireplace, and the latter was decorated with wainscoting.
The kitchen has a breakfast area and a walkout to the main deck.
Ms. Brown notes that the lower level is "completely above grade" with an extra bedroom, fireside recreation room and office with large windows and a side door to the patio.
Attached to the side of the house is a garage leading out to a private driveway.

Full text: Canada's outdoor 'lifestyle malls' aim to evoke the urban retail experience of 50 years ago - but in a deluxe way
Eddy Tarantino and Joseph Santeramo were increasingly concerned about the future. Their Barbuti Fine Men's Clothing had been a great success in Toronto's Bayview Village shopping centre since it opened 25 years ago.
They had a solid list of older repeat customers but the problem was they just were not getting the younger trade, Mr. Tarantino says.
"We needed to do something that put us on the leading edge, something that gave a new image and drew younger customers," he says.
The pair did two things. First they acquired the Hugo Boss line, and second they moved their store a couple of kilometres south and east to a new 1,850-square-foot premises in Toronto's first lifestyle shopping centre - the Shops at Don Mills.
It seems to have worked a treat.
"We now have a lot of walk-in trade," Mr. Santeramo says. "The strategy of being part of a new leading edge concept seems to be working."
New? Leading edge? For Canada, maybe. There is just one other lifestyle shopping centre in Canada - the five-year-old Park Royal Village in Vancouver. But the concept is decades old in the United States, where it spread from such sunny states as California slowly north to such cities as Cleveland and Columbus, Ohio.
In fact, calling it new and leading edge is a misnomer. What developers are doing is turning the clock back half a century to when a city's downtown main street was its hub for retail. The new Shops at Don Mills opened in April on the site of what was Canada's first shopping centre at Don Mills Road and Lawrence Avenue East. It is an attempt to duplicate what Toronto's Yonge Street once was.
It brings back the days when people drove to Yonge Street, parked their cars and walked from store to store, says Anne Morash, vice-president, development, for Cadillac Fairview Corp., which is the Shops at Don Mills' owner.
The centre has 101 stores aimed at the mid- to high-end market offering 450,000 square feet of retail space and a four-storey parking garage with 1,059 spaces. Eventually there will also be 1,300 residential units on the 40-acre site.
But the Shops at Don Mills is not just condos and commerce. There are also parks, water features and those grace notes one might have expected to find in the heart of any town or city.
"What Cadillac Fairview tried to do was re-create a typical downtown experience before those big box stores killed them," says Mary Mowbray, manager of the retail group at real estate broker Colliers International. "And so far it seems to be successful."
Tenants seem pleased. Ask Francis Argouin, marketing manager for Salomon Sports Canada of Markham, Ont. The international, high-end sports and recreation company chose the Shops at Don Mills to launch its first corporately owned store in North America.
Its 2,200-square-foot outlet opened in April. "We have been happy with traffic to date," Mr. Argouin says. "But the real test will be in the fall when people start sticking up for the ski season and buy outerwear."
One of the reasons both Barbuti and Salomon chose the Shops at Don Mills was the demographics of the trading area, they say, which is populated by families in the mid- to upper-income range with a high percentage in the 45-to-55 age group - well-to-do consumers with money to spend. The Shops have attracted other upscale retailers such as Anthropologie, which offers a one-of-a-kind shopping experience for the affluent professional woman.
The old Don Mills Shopping Centre, which was levelled despite protests from the community, had been on the site since 1955. The problem was that the structure was aging, the centre faced strong competition from other malls, and surveys showed that the average age of local residents was 45 but the average age of shoppers was 55, Ms. Morash says.
"We did a lot of surveys and they found that time was one of the most precious things to people in the area," she says. "They wanted to be able to get in, shop and then get out quickly. We couldn't meet that need with a large enclosed regional mall."
Cadillac Fairview looked south of the border for inspiration. But would an outdoor lifestyle mall fly in a city that seems to have but two seasons - winter and road repair?
"We looked for inspiration to Cleveland rather than Scottsdale," Ms. Morash says.
Cleveland, which shares a similar climate to Toronto's, has two lifestyle malls, and both are hugely successful, she says. "Our concern was not with snow affecting shopping traffic but with rain. We are used to shopping in snow and if it snows too much we just don't shop at all - not in enclosed malls or outdoor ones."
To beat the rain, 60 per cent of the Shops at Don Mills storefronts have canopies, and the walkway between the parking garage and the main shopping street is covered.
Ms. Mowbray says that as a retail consultant she would like to see a different mix of housing with perhaps condos on two or three levels above the shops. She also says the retail mix may focus too much on fashion and may not offer enough food alternatives.
"But I definitely think this is the coming wave in shopping centre development," she says.
Ms. Morash says Cadillac Fairview does indeed have others in the planning stages but will not say where they will be or when they might start construction.
"They seem to solve a broad range of problems," she says. While the Shops at Don Mills actually cost more than a regional mall to build - about $20-million - that was because of extras and attention to detail, Ms. Morash says. Future lifestyle centres may cost less.
They are also cheaper to operate and make better use of energy resources - no need to heat or cool large indoor spaces, just the retail outlets themselves.
"Personally I think this is the next wave for retailing," she says.

Full text: Walk through the grand arched entrance of Universal Studios' Dubai theme park, and you step into ... wind-swept desert.
No Hollywood thrill rides, no ticket kiosks, no studio backlots. Even the guard house and the construction office sat empty during a recent visit.
The planned park is part of a vision by Dubai officials to turn a patch of sand on the edge of the Mideast city-state into Dubailand - a vast amusement complex twice the size of Walt Disney World studded with theme parks including Universal Studios, Six Flags and Legoland, along with resorts, the world's biggest shopping mall and the first golf course designed by Tiger Woods.
It is now unclear when or if much of it will ever get built. Dubailand has hit the harsh economic realities of the global downturn, much like the rest of Dubai, which once seemed unstoppable in its drive to build the biggest, the tallest, the most extravagant.
"At this point, it's kind of hard to sell," Bobby Sarkar, a real estate analyst at Al Mal Capital in Dubai, said of the Dubailand project. "Obviously it's not feasible currently."
Dubailand was conceived at a time when cash was readily available and the pint-sized emirate was expanding rapidly, building man-made islands, ever-taller skyscrapers and gleaming luxury housing. Now in the world economic crisis, easy credit has disappeared, and Dubai faces crippling debt and a glut of brand-new real estate. Thousands of foreign workers who flocked here seeking higher-paying jobs are pouring out of the city as layoffs mount.
"Was Dubailand a sound idea? In part yes," said David Camp, director at ERA Aecom, whose consulting firm was involved in early plans for the site. "But it got carried away, like most of Dubai."
Dubailand was launched six years ago as part of the emirate's push to more than double its tourism numbers to 15 million visitors by 2015. The hope was that their dollars, euros and riyals would keep the economy chugging ahead despite the emirate's dearth of oil reserves.
The project sprawls over more than 259 square kilometres of desert - bigger than Orlando, Fla., home of some of the most famous amusement parks in the United States.
A few parts have been built, including a humble outlet mall and a fairground open only during the cool winter months. A sales centre on the outskirts of the site touts what Dubailand is supposed to become, promising dinosaurs and spaceships, Spiderman and Shrek. Two live tigers prowl a glass enclosure next to the reception desk.
But much of what is promised appears to be stalled and running well behind schedule. One of the more extravagant ideas - an artificial snow park housed under a glass dome - has quietly disappeared from the project's website.
Dubailand senior vice-president Mohammed al-Habbai said in a brief written statement that "there is no change to the vision of Dubailand and we can reaffirm that all our projects will be developed and delivered to completion."
He gave no time frame, saying only that the project "was designed as a phased development to be built over a number of years."
Neither Dubailand nor its overall developer Tatweer made officials available for interviews.
The idle appearance of the Universal Studios site suggests it will not open next year as advertised at the sales centre. Universal Studios' parent NBC Universal, a unit of General Electric Co., referred questions to Tatweer, which said only that work was progressing.
Six Flags, the New York-based amusement park chain, said plans for its first Mideast park were "moving forward" but provided no additional information. The company filed for bankruptcy protection in June.
The Tiger Woods-designed golf course will not open as planned this year. Mr. Woods recently told The AP the project is delayed and is "out of my hands."
Dubailand said "consistent progress continues" at the course. Three of the 18 holes are completed, which it said confirms its commitment to the project.
Union Properties, a local company building the world's first Formula One theme park at Dubailand, said in March the racing-themed project would be pushed back a year to 2010 because of a lack of funding. Analysts at Mideast bank EFG-Hermes have speculated the project could be dumped altogether.
The opening of the Legoland park is expected to be pushed back two years from its original 2011 target, said Sally Ann Wilkinson, a spokeswoman for Merlin Entertainments Group, a British amusement park operator that contracted with Tatweer to build the park.
For the international brands, Dubailand must have looked like a great opportunity.
"Around Dubai, and I'm talking about a radius of more than 3,000 miles, there are no major theme parks. Given that, it is a good idea to have a world-class theme park in the Middle East," said former Dubai resident and amusement park enthusiast Stefan Zwanzger, who blogs about the industry at Thethemeparkguy.com. "I'm not sure it makes sense to build 10 or 11 theme parks at about the same time."
The deals were typically structured as licensing agreements that left the international companies with little financial risk, according to regulatory filings and analysts. Partnering companies in effect got paid while gaining a toehold in a part of the world with a booming population and little competition.
But industry observers say the slump could also be a blessing, giving Dubai a chance to rethink its priorities.
"What Dubai thought they'd done was create this everlasting growth market. ... The world was booming. Whatever crazy idea you came up with, people said 'yeah I'll buy it,"' said Mr. Camp, the consultant.

Full text: Suicide suspected after body of reality-television contestant discovered in B.C. motel
Ryan Jenkins, the reality-TV contestant accused of killing his model ex-wife and stuffing her into a suitcase, has been found dead of apparent suicide, the RCMP said last night.
Mr. Jenkins's body was found in a room at the Thunderbird Motel in Hope, B.C., Sergeant Duncan Pound of the Mounties' border-integrity unit said from Surrey, B.C.
"At this present time, the investigation into the circumstances of his death is continuing, but preliminary evidence suggests that he took his own life," Sgt. Pound said in a statement.
Adam Curt, 19, a motel employee, discovered the body yesterday afternoon. He said that Mr. Jenkins had checked into the motel on Friday with a woman, but that staff had noticed suspiciously little activity over the weekend.
When he and the motel's manager went to check up on the occupants, they found Mr. Jenkins dead. He had hanged himself from the clothes rack in his closet.
"We opened up the door and there he was hanging by a belt."
He was wearing a blue shirt and blue jeans and looked as though he had been dead for several days, Mr. Curt said.
"It was pretty horrifying," Mr. Curt said. "It was pretty putrid."
Sgt. Pound said the local RCMP detachment responded to a call from motel employees reporting a deceased person early yesterday afternoon. Police would not say how long Mr. Jenkins had been at the motel or how long he had been deceased before his body was found. His identity was confirmed just before 5 p.m.
"Obviously this wasn't the resolution we were hoping for," Sgt. Pound said.
The announcement came just hours after the RCMP confirmed that Mr. Jenkins was, indeed, in Canada.
As early as Wednesday, officials on both sides of the border suspected Mr. Jenkins, a 32-year-old former Calgary resident, had illegally slipped into Canada, possibly by foot from Washington State to British Columbia.
The RCMP, which had received tips about the case as far away as Montreal and Toronto, had issued a Canada-wide arrest warrant for Mr. Jenkins, a real-estate developer and businessman who claimed to be a millionaire.
Mr. Jenkins hadn't been seen by police since he walked into a Los Angeles police station on Aug. 15 and reported his wife, Jasmine Fiore, a former swimsuit model, had gone out to run errands and get her nails done, but then never returned.
Earlier that day, the 28-year-old woman's naked, mutilated and beaten body was found in a dumpster in Buena Park, a city southeast of Los Angeles.
She had been stuffed in large, grey suitcase, and her fingers and teeth had been removed. Police officials were later able to identify Ms. Fiore by tracing the serial numbers on her breast implants. A preliminary coroner's report suggests she was strangled.
The tabloid press has feasted on details of the case ever since California law officials disclosed Mr. Jenkins, a former VH1 reality-television contestant, was a "person of interest" in Ms. Fiore's murder.
Popular gossip website TMZ.com has posted numerous photographs of the couple, who were married in Las Vegas in March after reportedly only knowing each other for two days (Ms. Fiore's mother has told reporters they had a stormy relationship and the marriage was later annulled).
TMZ also posted a video showing Ms. Fiore dancing in a bikini beside a pool earlier this month in Las Vegas. Mr. Jenkins shot the video and is heard saying: "God, I love my life. And I love my wife. ... Luckiest guy in the world, right here."
Last Thursday, Mr. Jenkins was charged with Ms. Fiore's murder.
Orange County District Attorney Tony Rackauckas said Mr. Jenkins was likely armed and has "the financial means to hide anywhere in the world."

Full text: The Miami Dolphins of last season were so devoid of star power that their promotional billboards featured an unsmiling image of a rookie head coach and the greying countenance of a front-office executive. During training camp this month, Bill Parcells, the old-school architect of the Dolphins, patrolled the sideline in polyester shorts.
Parcells may not earn any style points on Ocean Drive, but he was good enough to transform the Dolphins from a one-win team to a division champion last season.
That might have been Extreme Makeover: Gridiron Edition, but this season, as if the entire team had been Photoshopped, the Dolphins are going glam, with a new owner intent on turning them into the NFL's version of the Los Angeles Lakers, boldface-named fans and all.
The Dolphins unveiled their latest rebuilding effort a few weeks ago, not on the practice field, but rather on a fashion runway at an opulent private club best known as the site of a famous celebrity murder. A pop-art star and a rapper were the primary attractions as the sun set over South Beach that night.
A few weeks earlier in a mall, the Dolphins held a news conference that featured a blasting soundtrack and an appearance by Jennifer Lopez. That followed a casting call for singers to be hired by the team, a new team song, and a stadium renamed for a niche beer with a connection to a local icon.
"We have a lot of seats, and it's hard to get people to go to games because there are so many alternatives in these times," said Stephen Ross, the New York real estate developer who recently completed his purchase of the team.
"To create an experience for fans to go to a game, an experience the whole family can enjoy, is very important to bringing people out to the games, to make it the place to be. 'I've got to be there.' If you've been to a game recently, there was a lot of apathy."
Ross grew up in South Florida in the 1970s, during the Dolphins' halcyon days when they played at the Orange Bowl.
Those years remain the gilded era around here - the Don Shula Expressway is a traffic-clogged thoroughfare 37 years after his team completed a perfect season - but almost everything else surrounding the Dolphins has changed. The Orange Bowl was demolished last year, and the Dolphins' stranglehold on a fan's time crumbled long before that. Even in their best years since then, when Dan Marino was playing, the Dolphins struggled to fill every seat.
The things that make South Florida perfect for the Chamber of Commerce - beaches, golf courses, boats and beautiful people - make it tough for ticket sales. The University of Miami Hurricanes football team rarely sells out, even when it is in contention for a national championship. The Florida Marlins baseball team sometimes draws just a few thousand fans.
Former Dolphins owner H. Wayne Huizenga tried to assure success by hiring a conga line of football celebrities: Jimmy Johnson, Nick Saban and Parcells. Ross has moved aggressively to raise the Dolphins' profile by dressing it up in the equivalent of a designer frock.
He has brought in celebrity artists and songwriters: Romero Britto, who was introduced at the news conference at the South Beach mansion where the designer Gianni Versace was killed, will decorate parts of the stadium with his colourful paintings; Jimmy Buffett reworded his hit song Fins for the team, and the stadium has been renamed for the Land Shark beer owned by Buffett's company; and the rappers T-Pain and Pitbull are rewriting the team fight song.
Not everyone is convinced that such theatrics are necessary. Jim Mandich, who played for Shula's Dolphins and is now a local broadcaster, said that on road trips to the Giants, Steelers and Packers, he noticed "no Ferris wheels, no jugglers, no faces getting painted."
The quieter concern is that the cult of celebrity may alienate the Dolphins' dominant cult figure: Parcells. The announcement of the members-only game-day club at Land Shark Stadium mentions special sideline access, the type of thing Parcells would seemingly abhor. Parcells is not talking about any of the new ventures, but he is a fierce protector of the sanctity of his team.
Head coach Tony Sparano, a Parcells protegé, said he, Parcells and the general manager, Jeff Ireland, had been clear about the boundaries of the football team.
"If we win, I might sing," Sparano said.
Ross, with singer Marc Anthony sitting beside him, was quick to note that he was keeping his hands off Parcells's turf.
"I keep saying to people, 'What do you want me to do, start working with Bill Parcells?' " Ross said.
"Then for sure we won't be winning. All we're doing is all on the margins. Owning a football team is about winning. Fans really want to see you winning games."

Full text: 125 KINGSWOOD RD.
WHAT: A detached brick two-storey on a lush ravine setting in the Beaches. The faithfully restored Arts and Crafts-style house has four bedrooms and two bathrooms on a 50 by 130 foot lot.
ASKING PRICE: $1.299-million
TAXES: $7,944.30 (2008)
AGENT: Royal LePage Real Estate Services Ltd.
(Anne Wouters)
Two large weddings and a surprise 60th birthday party have taken place without a hitch inside this house, whose principal rooms are so generously proportioned that last year 54 people sat down comfortably for a marriage feast within the walls of the main floor living room.
To accommodate their guests, homeowners Jean and Eric Drumm had first stripped the room of all its furniture.
Still, the space sparkled thanks to built-in bookcases made of gleaming gumwood and ornate light fixtures that speak to the home's original Arts and Crafts design.
Faced with glass panel doors dating to 1917, the year the house was built for Clarence Robinson, owner of a luggage business of nearby Queen Street, the bookcases were the reason the couple first bought the house 20 years ago.
Mr. Drumm owns an impressive collection of first editions inherited from his late father, an Anglican minister.
Spanning the fields of English literature, philosophy and early Canadiana, the titles number in the hundreds. When looking for a house, the objective was to find one large enough to contain them, as well as several other prized possessions passed down through the generations on Mr. Drumm's side.
"I think Eric thought this house would be a showcase for his family's antiques and heirlooms," says Mrs. Drumm.
"The rooms were spacious enough to accommodate the large dining room table and hutch that he had inherited from his parents, and the bookcases could hold all his books."
For his part, Mr. Drumm was also taken by the age of the house, as it reminded him of the types of old homes he knew as a child in Hamilton, Ont.
"I think it was the style that appealed to me," he says. "I like older houses, and when I came to Toronto I moved to the Beach because it reminded me of the older style homes that I grew up with."
Mr. Drumm's passion for the past is reflected throughout his home which he and his wife have not only decorated with antiques - among them a family sampler dating to the 1700s - but took pains to restore to its original glory over the last two decades.
As the Drumms tell it, there were only four prior owners during the course of the home's history, with very little previously done in the way of renovations.
"It was very tired looking when we first saw it," says Mrs. Drumm.
"We undertook major renovations of the kitchen and the bathrooms. We also put in new electrical throughout, which meant we also did a lot of plaster restoration."
As well, the couple installed a new energy-efficient furnace, gas and electric fireplaces in the living room and downstairs family room and replaced all the old lead pipes with copper.
On the outside, they undertook extensive repair of a Japanese garden first planted in 1917, installing a wide outdoor staircase that leads to a stone patio on the bottom level, and introducing flowering plants and bushes along with a new sprinkling system.
On the inside, to preserve the home's historic character, they renovated with an eye to keeping most walls in place so as to safeguard cove ceilings that measure almost nine feet in height.
The exception was on the lower level where a small bathroom and adjoining broom closet were joined to make room for a walk-in shower.
The upstairs bathroom they gutted before adding all new fixtures as well as a vanity custom-made to match the home's Arts and Crafts style.
A personal touch was added in the form of a painted mural by local artist Elody Mobley depicting scenes from England's Kew Gardens, orchids and fronds and the Queen's freckled deer included.

Full text: Doug Harrison and Margaret Grottenthaler love their renovated Cabbagetown heritage home. But when they turned their minds to building a summer getaway house, the looks of yesteryear were banished
Doug Harrison and Margaret Grottenthaler own two houses that couldn't be more different. The Toronto couple and their two children live in a Victorian semi in the historic downtown neighbourhood of Cabbagetown. They've faithfully restored the towering but narrow row house, decorating it with furniture, accessories and architectural details that summon the grandeur and formality of 19th-century living.
Meanwhile, the family's summer home in Port Elgin, Ont., is a beach house with an unabashedly modern style, open concept, and West Coast feel. The sprawling cottage on Lake Huron, for instance, has a back wall that is entirely composed of floor-to-ceiling windows. Standing in the cottage's two-storey great room, gazing toward the beach and lake, it's hard not to feel like you're in Malibu, Calif., or Tofino, B.C.
The stark contrast is not lost on Mr. Harrison and Ms. Grottenthaler, two Bay Street lawyers who consciously created polar-opposite living environments to reflect their differing architectural interests - and the different pace of life inside and outside the big city.
"We have this Victorian, so why not go to the opposite extreme and do something that takes advantage of the landscape?" is how Ms. Grottenthaler explains their thinking. "Why not look out at the water? That's why we bought the property."
When the couple bought the property in late 2003, they intended simply to renovate the existing cottage, which sat on cinderblocks, by moving around walls and fixing the plumbing. But a harsh winter caused a stream on their land to swell and run amok. "The stream got diverted and basically flooded under the cottage," Mr. Harrison says. "The cottage was just floating, like in a lake. That summer, everywhere you walked was all spongy. We said, forget it."
The renovation plans quickly turned into demolition-and-rebuilding plans. But even then, the couple didn't have a clear idea what kind of cottage they wanted. Thorough and detail-oriented people, they bought hundreds of dollars worth of books and magazines on cottages, looking for ideas. At first, they favoured the kind of classic saltbox cottages you might find in Cape Cod or other parts of the U.S. Northeast and Eastern Canada: peaked, shingled roof, dormers, tongue-and-groove siding.
Then they met with Toronto interior designer Shelley Kirsch, who had earlier orchestrated the restoration of their Victorian city home, and she suggested a bold alternative. "I thought they were very beautiful," Ms. Kirsch says of the traditional cottages that Mr. Harrison and Ms. Grottenthaler first considered, "but having seen the site, I thought they needed to do something more modern and beach house, with the whole back being windows as opposed to punctuated by windows.
"I wanted the whole thing to have a horizontal quality to it, low-slung, and just generally the aesthetic to be more modern." As well, Ms. Kirsch wanted the couple's cottage experience to be the "absolute antithesis" of their city home life.
Mr. Harrison and Ms. Grottenthaler agreed, changing their search to magazines featuring West Coast architecture. They found some beach-house examples to emulate, and brought in Toronto architect Kevin Downey at Ms. Kirsch's recommendation.
Like Ms. Kirsch, Mr. Downey made the view a priority. He added two metres of fill beneath the cottage to raise it higher, thus giving anyone in the house an elevated and unimpeded view to the lake. "We had a simple mandate," Mr. Downey says. "We wanted to be bright and airy and informal and inviting, and we wanted to focus on the view."
The cottage was Mr. Downey's first experience creating a summer home, and he was pleased with the results. "It's a place I'd love to have myself."
Mr. Harrison and Ms. Grottenthaler were equally pleased. "The one thing we didn't want to compromise on with the architect was that wall of windows," Ms. Grottenthaler says. "I think that's what makes the cottage really unique."
The cottage is unlike any of the others located along a quiet, dead-end street that fronts the lake, and strikes a balance between being luxuriously appointed and casual in its vibe.
The bulk of the floor space is a 40-foot-by-20-foot space that contains the kitchen, dining room and lounge area. The scale is immense. The ceiling, finished in pine strips, soars more than 20 feet. The table in the dining room seats up to 14; a tangerine-orange sectional sofa can accommodate a couple of families.
The floor is, mostly, polished concrete throughout, with radiant heating beneath. Floor-to-ceiling built-in cabinetry, made of sanded oak, covers most of the interior walls. Even the door handles on the bathrooms and bedrooms are large - industrial in size and quality.
"I really wanted to give them the opposite of what they had in Toronto," Ms. Kirsch reiterates. "Big, wide, unfussy spaces, easy to clean up; broad views, letting the materials and the forms dictate the experience."
The five bedrooms are located at the ends of the great room. Two are on the south end, including the master bedroom, which has a door leading to a backyard patio, hot tub and an outdoor shower. Another two bedrooms, each belonging to one of the couple's grade-school-aged children, are located at the north end.
The fifth is the cottage's jewel.
Used as a guest room, it's on a second floor above the children's rooms, and from the outside bears a quaint resemblance to lighthouses seen along the Lake Huron shoreline. From the inside, meanwhile, it has the feel of a tree house: The windows look directly into a stand of firs growing in the backyard, between the house and the beach.
In total, the house can sleep 13 people - 17 if blowup mattresses and the sofa are put into duty - so it has become a magnet for visitors.
That suits Mr. Harrison and Ms. Grottenthaler just fine. They're very social people, and are fans of dinner parties. Having the cottage gives them more opportunity to spend time with their friends and relatives. "With the cottage, you can invite friends up for the whole weekend," says Ms. Grottenthaler, who has worked out a deal with her law firm to take summers off so that she and the kids can stay in Port Elgin throughout July and August. "We have company up almost every weekend," she says.
The couple recently held a 50th-anniversary party for her parents (everybody fit), and their children have had friends visit, too, for long stretches.
Mr. Harrison adds that the cottage has brought the family even closer together. "All four of us can be in the [Toronto] house and have no awareness of where the others are," he says. "Somebody's on the third floor, in a bedroom, in the kitchen, whereas here, it's one big space. We're together as a family."
The cottage doesn't always bustle, however. Ms. Grottenthaler says there is plenty of time for quieter, individual pursuits such as reading or, in Mr. Harrison's case, tidying up legal work in the cottage's office, which is located off the master bedroom and is equipped with high-speed Internet and other technological amenities.
But the highest-priority activity remains taking in the view. Whether sitting on the beach or in the cottage looking west out onto the lake, you can, as Ms. Kirsch says, be "hypnotized" by the water and the rolling waves that stretch to the horizon.
Extreme weather provides perhaps the most compelling show. "It's pretty dramatic when there are storms coming across the water, building on the horizon," Ms. Grottenthaler says. "You see the lightning marching toward you."
Ms. Kirsch adds that winter provides yet another visual feast. "You feel like you're in Iqaluit," the designer says. "You really feel like you're off the grid somewhere."
Which to Mr. Harrison and Ms. Grottenthaler is the whole point - being somewhere totally different from their 19th-century semi in the heart of the big city.

Where the sun sets on Lake Huron
When Toronto lawyer Doug Harrison tells his friends and colleagues he's headed to his cottage in Port Elgin, Ont., for the weekend, he's often asked, "Huh? Where's that?"
The beach town on Lake Huron in western Ontario is unfamiliar to many Torontonians, who are more aware of Muskoka, the Kawarthas or Prince Edward County as cottage destinations. "It's not on the radar," says Mr. Harrison. "It's amazing how many Torontonians don't know about it."
But the days of obscurity for Port Elgin and the neighbouring community of Southampton might not last much longer. "We're starting to notice more people from Toronto coming to the region," local real-estate agent Brad Angel says. "The Kawarthas and places like that have become quite expensive, and people are looking for alternatives."
Prices are lower along Lake Huron, although it's no bargain basement. Lakefront properties start at about $450,000, largely because there is such a tight supply. The area has always been popular with families from London, Guelph and Hamilton, and there's little ownership turnover. Cottages are often handed down through the generations.
If the lure of lower prices isn't enough of a draw, the natural beauty is. Wide, sandy beaches interspersed with rugged outcrops, as well as the vast expanse of Lake Huron, are compelling. "You just cannot get better sunsets than on the Lake Huron shore," says Mr. Angel, the broker of record for Coldwell Banker-The Property Shoppe.
Mr. Harrison's reasons for venturing three hours west of his Toronto home and office are more personal. He grew up in Hamilton, and his wife, Margaret Grottenthaler, is from Guelph.
They spent summers in their youth in and around Southampton, and rented cottages in the area as adults before buying their own land in 2003 and building a modernist beach house. "I think most people gravitate, when they get a cottage, to the area they experienced as children," Ms. Grottenthaler notes.
Port Elgin and Southampton are about a half-hour north of Kincardine, and an hour southwest of Owen Sound. Port Elgin, whose population includes blue-collar workers, white-collar types from the Bruce nuclear plant, and increasingly affluent cottagers, has a main street that's seen several new establishments open over the past couple of years, including a deli, a pair of yuppie-friendly coffee shops, an English pub and a swank Italian restaurant. Southampton has long had enough upscale shops and services to satisfy city folk.
Still, the area is relatively isolated, and Mr. Harrison and Ms. Grottenthaler hope that never changes. They prefer the slow pace and lack of modern trappings. "In Muskoka, you have to be much more industrious," Ms. Grottenthaler says. "You have to boat, you have to swim, you have to fix the dock. Here, you don't have to do anything. You just have to get out your lawn chairs and read a book." For many harried Torontonians, that might be the biggest lure of them all.

Listing agent: Terri Perras, Coldwell Banker Terrequity Realty
Toward the end of winter, this 2,500-square-foot house was reduced from $919,900 to $888,000 in order to tempt "price sensitive" house hunters, agent Terri Perras says.
The tactic made the property harder to resist in comparison to 3,500- to 4,000-square-foot residences often built on 50-foot-wide lots within the Etobicoke community.
"It's a good deal for a brand new house in an area where most of the homes are either older bungalows about to be torn down or [new properties worth] over a million," Ms. Perras says. "It filled a nice niche."
Last year, a local builder completed the two-storey plan by expanding on the foundations of the original bungalow on the pie-shaped lot.
The current floor plan includes four bedrooms and four bathrooms, plus a lower-level bedroom and recreation room.
Notable finishes include nine-foot ceilings and pot lights on the main level, hardwood floors throughout, stainless steel kitchen appliances and a tiled laundry room upstairs.
According to Ms. Perras, the most memorable space is the 360-square-foot master suite in a private wing above the double garage, with a five-piece bathroom and his and her closets.
"People loved the size of the master," the agent says. "It was like your own little oasis."
There is a main-floor office and open living and dining area with a gas fireplace flanked by large art niches. Toward the rear is a kitchen and sitting area with a walkout.
"When you walk in the front door, you saw virtually the whole main floor, right through to the backyard," Ms. Perras says. "It had more of an urban feel."
Behind the backyard is Glen Park, which is essentially bound by the backyards of other homes. "It's pretty rare," Ms. Perras says. "It's a huge green space with a new playground, splash pad and tennis courts."

Co-op agent: Nutan Brown, Royal LePage Real Estate Services Ltd.
Looking for a renovation project in the Annex, agent Nutan Brown's clients decided this 2½-storey, semi-detached house was a worthy candidate in need of modern updates and decor.
Likely built during the 1920s, the roughly 3,500-square-foot residence was a rooming house comprising five bedrooms, five bathrooms and three kitchens, plus a finished lower level with a separate entrance.
The roofing and windows were recently replaced, but newer mechanical systems and interior finishes were needed.
"[The buyers] just loved the potential, they loved the size and loved the location," Ms. Brown says. "My clients will be converting it into a single-family home with a basement apartment."
The current setup has a main floor powder room and separate living and dining rooms.
An uninsulated sunroom was built off the kitchen. "Being able to just update and renovate it rather than add it is a huge bonus," the agent says.
The second floor houses a full bathroom and three bedrooms, including one with a two-piece bathroom, fireplace and balcony.
On the third floor, there are two bedrooms, a kitchen and bathroom.
The basement contains one bedroom, a full bathroom and kitchen.
At the back of the property, there is a double garage with laneway access. "It has private parking, which is always a premium," Ms. Brown says.
The subway, schools and Christie Pits Park are within walking distance, as well as local performance and movie theatres, shops, restaurants and cafes on Bloor Street.

Abstract: Running two seasons on the now-defunct network The WB, this entertaining, low-concept reality show focused on graduating classes 10 years later - more than enough time for dreams to be realized or dashed. In tonight's second-season opener, 19 classmates from the 1988 grad class of Arizona's Chandler high school have been assembled at a swank resort in Kauai.

COMEDY
Ron James: Quest
for the West
CBC, 8 p.m.
Ron James confirmed his rank as this country's top monologist with this hour-long special from last season. The pride of Glace Bay, N.S., James sets his sights on the western provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan. In his now trademark rapid-fire fashion, he serves up unique observations on the Calgary Stampede, gun control, the Grey Cup and Saskatchewan blizzards. He also delivers what may be the best impression of a prairie gopher ever put on film.
DRAMA
Ugly Betty
ABC, CITY-TV, 9 p.m.
The girl-power series wraps its third season with a two-hour finale rife with guest stars. For fans of the show, the big news is Christopher Gorham, who reprises his role as the bumbling Henry, Betty's former ex-fiancé, who returns at the precise moment that our heroine (America Ferrera) agrees to move in with her new beau, Matt (Daniel Eric Gold). Showing up in cameos as themselves: The View 's Joy Behar and Elisabeth Hasselbeck and tennis legend Billie Jean King.
BIOGRAPHY
Maria Callas: Living and
Dying for Art and Love
PBS, 9:30 p.m.
The tragic life and times of opera diva Maria Callas form the basis of this stellar BBC documentary. Comprised largely of archived performances from the fifties and sixties, the film parallels Callas's life with that of Floria Tosca, the primary figure in the Italian opera Tosca (and not coincidentally, one of Callas's most revered stage roles). The profile asserts that the famed soprano never recovered from her long-time lover Aristotle Onassis's marriage to Jackie Kennedy in 1968. The program includes interviews with several of the grand diva's friends, including Dame Judi Dench, opera impresario Alan Sievewright and filmmaker Franco Zeffirelli.
COMEDY
Becker
SunTV, 11 p.m.
Wander into this show any weeknight for a brief flashback of nineties sitcom nostalgia. Running on CBS from 1998 to 2004, the series starred former Cheers barman Ted Danson as Dr. John Becker, a crotchety medic plying his trade in the Bronx. Stories were split between the title character's medical office and the local coffee shop, which allowed for regular interplay with a handful of quirky support characters. In tonight's outing, Becker is left prone on his kitchen floor when his back goes out. Little-known fact: The show was co-produced by Mad Men creator Matthew Weiner, who also wrote many of the episodes.

HISTORY
Ship of Ice
History, 7 p.m.
This program looks back at the icy remains of one of history's oddest naval experiments: the Second World War effort of Geoffrey Pyke, an eccentric but brilliant British engineer who conceived an indestructible ship made entirely of ice. The concept captured the fancy of Winston Churchill and Lord Mountbatten, who realized its advantages as a floating airfield in the frigid Atlantic Ocean. In concert with the Canadian government, the project went forward and a prototype was constructed and tested in Alberta's Patricia Lake.
DRAMA
Without a Trace
CBS, 8 p.m.
Devotees of this sturdy crime-procedural are likely still in mourning since CBS cancelled the show after seven seasons. But the network had to make room for the next generation of crime dramas such as The Bridge and NCIS: Los Angeles . Viewers who stuck with Without a Trace did so for one of two reasons: the lovely Poppy Montgomery as FBI profiler Samantha "Sam" Spade, or Anthony LaPaglia as the gruff and complex unit leader, Jack Malone. Tonight, Jack grudgingly agrees to search for his daughter's missing wastrel boyfriend.
SCIENCE
Guinea Pig
Discovery, 10:30 p.m.
Who is Ryan Stock and why is he doing those terrible things to his body? In the lowbrow vein of MTV's Jackass , this series follows the ex-circus performer as he submits his body to cruel and unusual punishment, presumably in the name of science. Accompanied by his fiancee, Amber Lynn, Stock tours Canada and the U.S. in search of new forms of self-torture. In tonight's show, he touches an arc of artificial lightning, tastes electricity, and dons a metal suit to absorb a million-volt shock. Kids, don't try this at home, or anywhere else.

SUNDAY
AUGUST 23
DOCUMENTARY
World's Tallest Woman
TLC, 7 p.m.
Meet Yao Defen, who at 7 foot 8 claims to be the tallest woman on the planet. The 37-year-old suffers from gigantism and the program does little to sensationalize her condition. Born to destitute farmers in China, she reached 6 foot 2 by age 11.Today, Chinese doctors are waiting to see if surgeries and treatments have halted Defen from growing even larger; her rare affliction brings with it heart disease, hypertension and osteopororis. Even though confined to a wheelchair, Defen remains in remarkably good spirits.
DOCUMENTARY
End of Suburbia
TVO, 8 p.m.
Written and directed by Toronto filmmaker Gregory Greene, this doc suggests the suburbs are quickly becoming unsustainable, courtesy of an unstable economy and rising oil prices. The post-war concept of suburban life was, of course, conceived in the era of cheap and plentiful oil; people working in the city could live a pastoral existence courtesy of a daily commute.
MOVIE
Strange Brew
Family, 9 p.m.
Released in 1983, this film was written by Dave Thomas and Rick Moranis, who were briefly lifted to pop-culture fame as the toque-wearing, beer-swilling brothers Bob and Doug McKenzie. Unlike the more recent deplorable cartoon spinoff, Bob & Doug , the movie had a budget, and a plot: An evil brewer (Max Von Sydow) creates a formula enabling him to control the minds of people who drink it. The affable hosers accidentally stumble on the plan and try to foil the madman's goal. Worth watching for the romantic line from Bob (Moranis): "If I didn't have puke breath, I'd kiss you."
DRAMA
Cold Case
CBS, 10 p.m.
Detective Lilly Rush (Kathryn Morris) investigates an unsolved murder from 1958. A young Ivy Leaguer (Johnathan Schaech) came up with the concept to develop affordable housing outside the city. Before the plan came to fruition, the man was murdered. The sudden reappearance of a woman with a connection to the deceased prompts Rush to reopen the case.

MONDAY
AUGUST 24
FOOD
Chuck's Day Off
Food Network, 7:30 p.m.
A former advertising executive turned gourmet chef, Chuck Hughes ran several of Montreal's hottest restaurants before opening his own eatery, Garde Manger, in 2006. The heavily tattooed gourmand has since merged the worlds of fine cuisine with his own predilection for the rock-and-roll lifestyle. Tonight's episode finds Hughes slapping together a morning-after breakfast for himself and his good friend, Robert. The menu includes Holy Mackerel Tortillas and a hangover shake known as the Resurrector.
DESIGN
Marriage Under
Construction
HGTV, 9 p.m.
Fascinating and real, this series follows the transition of real-life couple Gillian and Ed out of their cramped condo and into their first real home. The appeal, of course, comes from their contrasting personalities: Gillian is hyper, which seems in keeping with her planned career in real estate; Ed is more laidback and possesses great confidence in his abilities as a home handyman. In this episode, the couple have already found their dream home and are busily renovating the interior when they hit an impasse: Is it wiser to convert the tiny spare room into an office for Ed or a small bedroom for visiting family and friends? DRAMA
Law & Order:
Criminal Intent
NBC, CTV, 9 p.m.
In this rebroadcast from last season, detectives Nichols (Jeff Goldblum) and Wheeler (Julianne Nicholson) unravel a scenario of best intentions gone wrong in New York literary circles. The case involves a prominent poet who panics when private-foundation funding to his poetry journal is cut off. He sends his attractive female assistant and paramour to the foundation president in hopes of reversing the decision, but the young woman is soon found dead on the street. The ensuing investigation reveals a plotline far more sordid than anything penned by Edgar Allan Poe.
BIOGRAPHY
American Masters:
Nat King Cole
PBS, 10 p.m.
Nat King Cole was one of the most beloved performers on TV back in the fifties. The silky-voiced singer was also one of the decade's top-selling artists, though racial tolerance only went so far: When his weekly series The Nat King Cole Show debuted on NBC in 1956, the show aired without a single corporate sponsor; advertisers were afraid that viewers would be offended by an African-American man on television. The program is highlighted by archival clips of the late singer performing his classic hits, including Mona Li sa , Unforgettable and Smile .

TUESDAY
AUGUST 25
DRAMA
POWER PLAY
TVtropolis, 7 p.m.
On CTV from 1998 to 2000, Power Play is a great Canadian series that captured the essence of our national game and holds up on second viewing. The show cast Michael Riley (CBC's Being Erica ) as Brett Parker, a smarmy New York sports agent who inherited the post of general manager of fictional NHL franchise the Hamilton Steelheads. Filmed in Hamilton, the cast included Kari Matchett as Parker's corporate nemesis/love interest and Gordon Pinsent as the eccentric team owner. Tonight's episode, second-last in the series, has the Steelheads in the finals.
DRAMA
NCIS
CBS, Global, 8 p.m.
To see how a popular crime drama transitions into a spinoff, watch tonight's NCIS rebroadcast from last season, which sets up this fall's arrival of NCIS: Los Angeles . In the two-part storyline, the unexplained murder of a U.S. Marine takes NCIS stalwarts Gibbs (Mark Harmon) and McGee (Sean Murray) to the L.A. office, where they discover the murder has become a matter of national security. They join forces with special agent Callen, played by Chris O'Donnell, and Hanna, played by LL Cool J, who will reprise the same roles this fall. It's just that easy.
HISTORY
Zero Hour
History, 9 p.m.
The time-capsule series revisits the 1995 terrorist attack on the Tokyo subway. In frightening detail, the program recounts the five co-ordinated attacks releasing deadly sarin gas; a dozen people were killed, more than 50 severely injured, and more than 1,000 passengers had temporary vision problems. The attacks were attributed to a religious cult known as Aleph, which sought to instill the group's founder as the country's new leader.
REALITY
High School Reunion
MuchMoreMusic, 10 p.m.
Running two seasons on the now-defunct network The WB, this entertaining, low-concept reality show focused on graduating classes 10 years later - more than enough time for dreams to be realized or dashed. In tonight's second-season opener, 19 classmates from the 1988 grad class of Arizona's Chandler high school have been assembled at a swank resort in Kauai. Characters include ex-best-friends Heather (The Preacher's Daughter) and Lynette (The Snob), and Kara (The Homecoming Queen) and her ex-husband Tom (The Jock). Makes you feel better about your own high school days.

BIOGRAPHY
The Achievers
Bravo!, 7 p.m.
The Hollywood profile series revisits the life of Gary Cooper, who created the persona of the strong, silent figure in American cinema. In a career spanning four decades and more than 100 films, Cooper won two best actor Oscars (for Sergeant York and High Noon ), but is perhaps better remembered for his portrayal of baseball legend Lou Gehrig in The Pride of the Yankees and his earnest roles in the Frank Capra-directed films Mr. Deeds Goes to Town and Meet John Doe . The cineaste experts interviewed in the program concur that Cooper was the last of his kind.
DESIGN
Stager Invasion
TLC, 7:30 p.m.
Back for a second season, Stager Invasion is hosted by professional stager Lisa Lynch, a high-energy type with a knack for sprucing up homes that have been on the market for a while. In most episodes, it's amazing to watch how quickly she transforms dowdy homes into residences worthy of a magazine photo spread. The first new episode tackles the case of Rose and her daughter Jennifer, who recently inherited Rose's childhood home. The price was right, but the old place is in dire need of an update. For starters, there's no front lawn and the interior is rife with sixties-era wood panelling. In one short day, Lisa and her staging team perform makeover magic.
Drama
Criminal Minds
CBS, CTV, 9 p.m.
A member of the Behavioral Analysis Unit turns lone wolf in this haunting rebroadcast from last season. The intense Dr. Spencer Reid (Matthew Gray Gubler) reopens the investigation into the murder of a young boy in Las Vegas that occurred years before. As new evidence comes to light, Dr. Reid makes a shocking connection to his own troubled childhood. The episode features a return appearance by the engaging character actress Jane Lynch ( Best in Show , The 40-Year-Old Virgin ) in the role of Reid's unstable mother.
DOCUMENTARY
Ken Burns: National Parks
- America's Best Idea
PBS, 9:30 p.m.
Remain calm, PBS viewers: This is not the full version of Ken Burns's latest documentary opus, but rather a sampler of the six-part series, which begins Sept. 27. Based on this brief glimpse, the 12-hour examination is in keeping with earlier Burns treatises on jazz, baseball and the Civil War. Most of the clips in the teaser are taken from the first episode detailing the origins of America's first national park: The sprawling and majestic landscape known as Yellowstone, which came into existence in 1872 as an act of U.S. Congress.
THURSDAY
AUGUST 27
HISTORY
Killing Hitler PBS, 9 p.m.
By now everyone knows about the failed attempt by Colonel Claus von Stauffenberg to assassinate Adolf Hitler in the late stages of the Second World War - the character was played by Tom Cruise in the feature film Valkyrie - but not many people realize some other German officers kept trying. Taken from historical records, this film chronicles the efforts of a British intelligence officer assigned to devise a plan for Hitler's assassination. Methods considered included sabotaging Hitler's private train and an assault on his refuge in the Bavarian Alps. The best option turned out to be a Polish marksman with no fondness whatsoever for the German leader.
DOCUMENTARY
This Beat Goes On
CBC, 9 p.m.Flashback to the seventies with this well-assembled documentary on Canadian rock music. Narrated by CBC Radio's Jian Ghomeshi, the two-part profile combines very cool archival footage of long-forgotten, homegrown bands - remember grooving to the likes of Prism, Trooper and the Kings? - with present-day reflections from artists who lived through the heady era. Also included are interviews with current Canadian artists like Sam Roberts and Serena Ryder. The second half of the film airs Sept. 3.
DRAMA Law & Order NBC, CTV, 10 p.m.
Newly situated on Thursday nights, the hefty crime procedural - which starts its 20th season next month - has been rebroadcasting some of its best shows from last year. Tonight, an NYPD officer with known money problems is killed by his fellow officers after taking hostages at gunpoint. When detectives Bernard (Anthony Anderson) and Lupo (Jeremy Sisto) dig deeper into the incident, they find valuable stolen memorabilia in the dead man's apartment, along with another dead body. The investigation leads them to the door of a local celebrity who claims to be the illegitimate son of a deceased president.
REALITY Crime 360 A & E, 11 p.m. Most outings in A & E's true-crime series are difficult to sit through, but tonight's show is even nastier than usual. In Cleveland, detectives Entenok and Armelli arrive at the scene of a brutal, senseless shooting that has claimed the lives of two adults and their four young children. The police locate two firearms and gradually piece together what appears to be a home invasion gone bad. Even scarier, the killer is still out there, somewhere.

Full text: One of Toronto's largest home builders will start fresh and develop a new mixed-use condominium at the site of the 1 Bloor luxury condo project after buying the property from its cash-strapped developer.
Great Gulf Homes confirmed yesterday it will take ownership of the site from Kazakhstan-based Bazis International Inc. in mid-September, writing a new chapter in a cautionary tale of marketing hype, frenzied sales and the crush of the global credit crisis.
Toronto's real estate world buzzed with word of the sale, as realtors fielded calls from anxious buyers concerned about deposits and the future of the project - once envisioned as Canada's tallest residential building - at the corner of Yonge and Bloor Streets.
"An affiliate of Great Gulf Homes has entered into an agreement to purchase the property and it will be closing mid-September," said Bruce Freeman, executive vice-president of Great Gulf. "We are presently developing plans for a mixed-use project."
He declined to elaborate, saying more details would be released after the deal closes, but The Globe has confirmed the purchase is strictly for the land and does not involve the previous owner's obligations, contracts or design.
In a terse statement, Bazis said all buyer deposits are protected in an escrow account, as required under Ontario's Condominium Act. A spokeswoman said neither she nor Michael Gold, the developer's Canadian president, could comment further because of a confidentiality agreement.
Buyers lined up for days in 2007 when units in the planned 80-storey, $450-million skyscraper first went on the block. About 500 purchasers signed deals ranging from $400,000 to several million dollars. The average buyer has $80,000 to $120,000 invested.
Anna Cass of Royal LePage Your Community Realty was one of 1 Bloor's top sellers, and bought a unit for herself. To guarantee herself a piece of the project, she rented hotel rooms, dressed in disguise and hired students to camp out in the days before it went on sale.
Ms. Cass said people still want the prestigious corner location. She urged Great Gulf to "be fair" and consider 1 Bloor buyers first for its new project.
"If Great Gulf is smart ... they will offer all the agents and their buyers first crack and first discount, at a very good rate," she said.
Great Gulf has been involved in about 10 major condominium projects in the Greater Toronto Area in recent years.
Garth Juriansz of Re/Max Realtron Realty, who also bought for himself at 1 Bloor and sold several units to clients, said he'd take his buyers elsewhere if Great Gulf starts anew with "inflated" prices. "It will be a significant mistake to throw all the people out and start again," he said.
1 Bloor's problems began last fall amid the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis and credit crunch, when Bazis's partner in the land purchase, Lehman Brothers, went bankrupt. Mr. Gold sought new financing partners. In December, 2008, he stopped making payments on a multimillion-dollar loan.
Local lenders bought the loan, then tried to place the project in receivership.
Last month, Mr. Gold agreed to sell the property as part of a court-approved plan to keep it out of receivership.
Gerry Miller, a real estate lawyer and partner at Gardiner Miller Arnold, said it's uncommon in Toronto for a condo project that has been fully conceptualized and well sold to falter suddenly. However, he said he would have steered his own clients away from 1 Bloor. "It was too expensive and unlikely viable ... it was just too big, too grand," he said.

Full text: L.A. woman's body found in suitcase in trash; she and Calgary man were briefly married
A Calgary real estate agent and reality-TV contestant is being sought by police in Southern California in connection with the death of former swimsuit model Jasmine Fiore, whom he married earlier this year in Las Vegas.
Ms. Fiore was last seen alive on Aug. 13 at a party in San Diego, which she attended with Ryan Alexander Jenkins, 32, her former husband. Nevada records show the pair married in March. The woman's mother, Lisa Lepore, said the marriage was annulled in May, although they later got back together.
Around 7 a.m. on Aug. 14, a body was found in a "very large suitcase" inside a dumpster in Buena Park, Calif., a Los Angeles suburb about 150 kilometres from the scene of the party, Buena Park police Lieutenant Gary Worrall said. The suitcase was found by a man rummaging for recyclables. Preliminary indications are that the victim was strangled.
Later that afternoon, Mr. Jenkins walked into a Los Angeles County Sheriff's office in West Hollywood and reported Ms. Fiore missing.
"He came to the station and provided a picture, gave a report," Lt. Worrall said. Officers called around, eventually connecting the body in the dumpster with the missing woman. "At that point, we were able to put the two together - that their missing was our deceased person."
But Mr. Jenkins had left the sheriff's office by then. Police haven't been able to track him down, and yesterday said the Canadian was a "person of interest" in the model's death.
"At this point, there's nothing we can point to that would make him a suspect in the crime, but he was the last person seen with her while she was alive, he reported her missing subsequent to her death, and we've been unable to contact him, which is suspicious to us," Lt. Worrall said. "We, of course, are concerned that he might go to Canada."
TMZ.com quoted Mr. Jenkins's publicist, who said Mr. Jenkins is "currently speaking to his attorney and will fully co-operate with the police in this matter. He is planning on meeting with them in the near future."
Buena Park police said Mr. Jenkins may have been driving Ms. Fiore's car, possibly with his Alberta licence plates. RCMP in Calgary have been alerted, but won't arrest anyone until a warrant is issued.
With no warrant, Mr. Jenkins would have been free to cross into Canada, RCMP Sergeant Patrick Webb said.
"It all depends on whether the steps have been done yet about if there's a warrant on his arrest," Sgt. Webb said.
In January, 2007, Mr. Jenkins was sentenced to 15 months of probation in Calgary on an assault charge, according to the Alberta Ministry of Justice.
Gossip and celebrity websites were buzzing yesterday with the news that Mr. Jenkins - a contestant on Megan Wants a Millionaire , in which a woman vies for the affections of purportedly wealthy men, in order to become a "trophy wife," and reportedly on I Love Money 3 - was being sought in connection with the death of Ms. Fiore, a former Playboy employee.
TMZ reported that Ms. Fiore sent a crude text message to a former boyfriend the night of her death, and that Mr. Jenkins had won I Love Money 3 and earned $250,000, although the series hasn't aired.
In his profile for Megan Wants a Millionaire , Mr. Jenkins took the nickname Smooth Operator and listed his worth at $2.5-million, and said he turned "player girls" into "princesses" and cheated on a woman only when he wanted to breakup with her.
VH1 yesterday scrapped the remaining episodes of Megan , "given the unfortunate circumstances," a statement said.
In Calgary, Mr. Jenkins's cellphone has been disconnected. Websites for two of the companies he said he was involved with - Concrete Equities and Townscape Developments - are offline. A woman at a third company, a real estate firm, said Mr. Jenkins left in April.
He'd been profiled in a local newspaper when he got into the real estate business, following in the footsteps of his father, Dan Jenkins, a Calgary architect.
"Ryan is Dan's son, but he has nothing to do with any of Dan's companies. And he did not work for us," a woman answering the phone at the father's firm said yesterday. "He's got absolutely nothing to do with our company."
She said the elder Mr. Jenkins was out of the country.
Ms. Lepore said Mr. Jenkins had his eye on making it big in Hollywood when he met her daughter, a former model who did an ad for Howard Stern's radio show.
"He had stars in his eyes," she said. "He was totally jazzed, like, being a star."

Full text: The entrepreneurs who gathered recently in Ottawa are confident they can help lead the country out of the recession
Meet the people who say they will deliver you from recession - or die trying.
"If you're not growing, you're dying," says Mark Hanna, president of Leeza Distribution Inc. of Montreal. "If you're going sideways, you're dead," agrees Jeff Lem, president of qdata inc. in Markham, Ont. "If you think you are going to get killed, you get killed," adds Oren Nutik, president of MDS Power Inc. in Montreal.
None of the three are counting on shrinking, going sideways or getting killed - nor are many of the other 82 entrepreneurs who joined them at a conference in Ottawa last week.
The gathering of mostly Canadian business owners - hosted by the local chapter of the Entrepreneurs Organization, or EO, which has 7,000 members in 28 countries - was a window on a rarely discussed yet significant aspect of the global economy. The smaller businesses these entrepreneurs create and run account for 60 to 80 per cent of the jobs created in the United States, and companies with fewer than 50 employees represent a quarter of Canada's gross domestic product, according to government figures. When politicians go to the local chamber of commerce and extol small business as the backbone of the economy, they aren't blowing smoke.
"We should care about them because companies like that contribute a lot to innovation and job creation," said Becky Reuber, a professor of strategic management at the University of Toronto's Rotman School of Management who studies entrepreneurship and smaller businesses. "They will be very important in leading us out of the recession."
The entrepreneurs who gathered in Ottawa - and whose companies generate annual sales between $1.5-million and $45-million apiece - seem to think so. In co-operation with The Globe and Mail, the conference organizers circulated an informal survey to gauge the mood of participants after a year battling the deepest global contraction since the Second World War.
Most respondents said they believe the worst is over, and expect business to pick up in 2010. Most also said they had discovered new opportunities during the downturn. Asked whether they would start a new business today or wait, most said they would "jump in."
"It's the small and medium-sized businesses that will get us out of this," said Stephen Kearley, president of insurance broker Benson Kearley in Newmarket, Ont.
The optimism evident at the Ottawa gathering was possibly stronger than that shown by other small-business owners. The most recent confidence survey by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, which represents 105,000 smaller and medium-sized enterprises, produced an index reading of only 58.6 in July, compared with 58.5 in June. A score greater than 50 indicates that owners who expect their performance to be stronger over the next 12 months outnumber those who predict it will be weaker.
"Despite the recent announcement from the Bank of Canada on the economy coming out of recession, SME [small and medium enterprise] confidence has not yet turned the corner," Ted Mallett, the CFIB's chief economist, wrote in the report.
While the slogan of the Ottawa conference was "Changing the World Through EO," the real mantra was voiced by Peter Thomas, founder of the Canadian unit of real estate firm Century 21, in an address that attendees couldn't stop talking about: Recessions are when money is transferred to smart people from dumb people.
The words of the former owner of a company that generated sales of $9-billion energized a group of people whose instincts are telling them they are about to receive healthy transfers from the dumb side of the ledger.
"This whole thing is fun," said Mr. Hanna, even though the recession is causing his sales to "flatten" at about $20-million after years of rapid growth. "It's a strategic game. That's the rush. There are no entrepreneurs inspired by safety."
Mr. Hanna, whose company distributes surface materials for countertops, is planning to move into floors. Mr. Nutik, who generates about $10-million in annual revenue by selling power-generating equipment, has hired a new sales manager to help bolster his presence in Latin America.
Blair Assaly, who runs a real estate company that owns 400 units in Edmonton, said he is "kicking a lot of tires" in Scottsdale, Ariz., where property values have sunk as much as 40 per cent.
Of course, the EO members who convened in Ottawa have felt financial pain. And while they are generally hopeful about their own prospects, some are less certain the broader economy is poised for recovery. "I didn't think [the recession] would last this long," Shelley Whatmore, president of Calgary-based TopFlight Asset Services, which sells refurbished cellphones, computers and other tech gear. Even though her profit is up because consumers are turning to cheaper goods, she is skeptical a rebound is imminent.
Mr. Assaly agreed. "My gut says it's not over yet. ... Until the consumer really starts believing, the recession isn't over."
Mr. Lem, whose qdata earns annual revenue of about $12-million selling software such as bar-coding gear, said he has managed to increase profit - but only through a lot of extra work. "The recession hit harder than we thought and more quickly than we anticipated," he said. He responded by pushing his sales team to try harder to sell qdata's services along with its equipment. The whip cracking is paying off: "We have slightly higher revenue, but we had to work twice as hard to earn that money."

No fuss, no muss, and no busts in Saint John

Full text: 'Healthy' waterfront city takes it slow and steady, though Irving Oil's plans for a new headquarters could give it a boost
Stephanie Turner expected a blue-collar city when she moved to Saint John three years ago. Instead she found a cosmopolitan community and a career in commercial real estate.
"I've had so many people say to me, 'Oh, you arrived in Saint John just at the right time,' " says Ms. Turner, who had moved from Moncton.
More than 122,000 people live in the greater Saint John area. Home to Canada's largest oil refinery, the New Brunswick port city has been developing into an energy hub and has been diversifying its economy.
It's been bolstered by megaprojects in the area, such as construction of a liquefied natural gas terminal and natural gas pipeline and refurbishment at the Point Lepreau nuclear plant.
Ms. Turner, who works in commercial sales and leasing with Cushman & Wakefield LePage, says the market has been strong in her time in the city.
Observers are also optimistic about potential projects on the horizon: a possible second nuclear reactor at Point Lepreau and a world headquarters for energy giant Irving Oil Ltd. on the Saint John waterfront. A second Irving Oil refinery, though, has been shelved.
The Irving headquarters project would see construction of a new building that could house about 1,000 people. It would also incorporate a cruise ship terminal. The land agreement between the city, local port authority and company must be finalized, and some municipal and federal approvals are needed. The project would bring staff from several offices in Saint John under one roof.
Part of the reason the Saint John commercial market has performed well is because most development doesn't happen on speculation, Bill MacAvoy says.
"The development here has really been based on actual quantified need," explains Mr. MacAvoy, managing director for Atlantic Canada with Cushman & Wakefield LePage in Halifax. "What that leads to is a very balanced market."
Company surveys show the overall office vacancy rate in Saint John dropped to 5.2 per cent for the last quarter of 2008 compared with 8.2 per cent the year before. Mr. MacAvoy says much of the space taken up last year resulted from expansion of existing firms such as Irving Oil and call-centre software provider Genesys Canada.
The economic downturn has affected vacancy, which has since spiked upward: Overall office vacancy reached 10.1 per cent as of the second quarter this year.
Still, Mr. MacAvoy describes 10 per cent or less as a healthy market. He also says much of the space on the market represents subleasing: companies - especially those based outside the city - trying to cut costs by reducing their space and subleasing some of their premises.
This has happened in many major centres, according to a Cushman & Wakefield sublet report early this year. Two of the notable exceptions were Fredericton and Moncton, which did not see a change in sublet space from the last quarter of 2008 to the first quarter of 2009.
Mr. MacAvoy says Saint John has fared well on a relative scale.
"We're not concerned about the health of the Saint John market at all," he says.
The commercial market has also seen growth and diversification in retail. East Point Inc., a retail real-estate development company, has been creating East Point Shopping, an open-air plaza with more of a main street and upscale feel, on the city's east side.
The development has a dozen stores and services as well as a hotel and food outlets. More openings are planned early next year. About 450,000 square feet of building area have been developed with a total of 700,000 expected within about three years.
The centre's president, Troy Northrup, credits megaprojects in the region for boosting the local economy but also points out they could create long-term spinoffs. He says that more energy projects mean more demand for those involved in refurbishment and tune-ups, for example, and more reason for such firms to move to Saint John for good. "I think the future for Saint John is bright," he says.
While the commercial property market hasn't shown great peaks and valleys in more than 35 years, it has been evolving, says Ellis Levine, associate broker with Prudential Summit Real Estate. The economy has diversified into light industrial uses, and the service industry has expanded with IT, call centres and high tech.
With transformation has come higher expectations in terms of office space, Mr. Levine says. "There's been an upgrade in the facilities," he says, explaining tenants increasingly want amenities such as wireless communication, parking nearby and buildings that are really "up to snuff."
He notes as one example the opening last year of Somerset Square, a LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) registered office building. LEED buildings are constructed to rigorous standards overseen by the Canada Green Building Council.
Ms. Turner and Mr. Levine say construction hasn't been plentiful, however. Costs are high and vacancy rates aren't low enough. There have been some creative developments, such as the renovation of a block of heritage buildings into CenterBeam Place in the business district. But Saint John still has a plethora of heritage buildings with empty space on upper floors.
Mr. Levine notes that economic uncertainty has made it tougher for developers to get financing. He says banks used to want developers with tenants on line with five- or 10-year leases, but that's increased in some cases to 15.
Mr. Levine is also disappointed that the largest megaproject on the horizon, a second Irving Oil refinery, has been shelved. He knows of several projects that were set aside following that news.
"It's going to be stagnant until we see a major announcement of investment capital coming in here," he says.
Ms. Turner agrees the second refinery was the biggest project on the horizon.
But she says leasing work has been keeping her busy, with investors, particularly from Western Canada, looking for properties, and growth here tends to happen on a slower scale.
"We're the tortoise," she says.

Full text: After the recession levelled its central industry, the city is forced to start from scratch, shifting gears to diversify its economy
jibbitson@globeandmail.com
28 PER CENT: Are unemployed in Detroit after the auto industry collapse
$350-MILLION: The city's deficit, even though it's not supposed to enter the red
450 HOMICIDES: Expected this year (Detroit's population is 912,000)
200TH PLACE: Out of 200, according to an index of best-performing cities
******
Mayor Dave Bing faced a room of silent anger as he addressed leaders of the roughly 50 unions representing 10,000 municipal workers recently.
Detroit is broke, he declared. It could be forced into the municipal equivalent of bankruptcy in October.
"You are talking about running out of cash in the next 60 to 70 days," he told reporters after the meeting.
"Time is not our friend, it is not our ally. If we go to receivership, all bets are off."
The United States may be emerging from a long and painful recession, but Detroit is mired in the depths of depression. Unemployment stands at 28 per cent. The city government is $350-million (U.S.) in the red on a $3.1-billion annual budget, and revenues for this year are down another $100-million. The city is at the epicentre of a state in crisis. The Michigan government's revenues for this fiscal year are now expected to fall at least $2.7-billion below previous worst-case projections for their $9.8-billion budget.
Unemployment statewide is above 15 per cent, the worst of any state in the country.
And what's bad for Michigan is bad for Ontario. The two economies are intimately intertwined, especially in the auto sector. More than one-quarter of all Canada-U.S. trade crosses the Ambassador Bridge between Windsor and Detroit each day.
But Detroit and Michigan haven't given up. Along the university research corridor - named in hopeful imitation of North Carolina's technology triangle - billions of dollars from government and private foundations are financing research in new technologies at state universities in Detroit, Ann Arbor and Lansing.
The principal focus is on alternative-energy research and, increasingly, on adapting automotive technology to biotechnology.
"Basically, if you can make a hood, you can make an elbow," explains Nancy Cappola, who works with an entrepreneurial development program at Detroit's Wayne State University.
There have been promising advances, there are exciting new startups. Will they employ millions of unemployed auto workers any time soon? No.
But their future is Detroit and Michigan's future.
If they succeed, Michigan can succeed. We don't know if they will. We only know they must.
Going for broke
The financial woes of the city are reflected on its streets. Much of downtown Detroit is a wasteland of vacant buildings and empty sidewalks, surrounded by blocks of boarded-up homes. Many of the people you encounter are homeless, raggedly in search of a handout, or at least a cigarette.
According to the postal service, as of March of this year, 20 per cent of the addresses in Detroit were vacant. In total, that's about 78,000 empty homes, twice as many as in 2005.
The city has the worst crime rate in the United States, according to most surveys. Detroit police are anticipating 450 homicides this year, within a population of 912,000. (The city's population in 1950 was 1.8 million.)
The Milken Institute/Greenstreet Real Estate Partners index of best-performing cities rates the greater Detroit area dead last in a survey of 200 cities, based on economic growth and job creation.
To forestall bankruptcy for Detroit, Mayor Bing wants city workers to accept a 10-per-cent pay cut and plans at least 1,000 layoffs, about 10 per cent of the city's work force. Thus far, none of the unions are bending.
Mr. Bing is also contemplating a broad range of cuts to city services, including discontinuing bus service on Sundays.
"The first thing we've got to do is get our arms around our costs," he maintained.
If bankruptcy were to happen, a receiver would replace the city government. All existing union contracts would be void. The receiver would have the power to cut city services until revenues are in line with expenses.
While police and fire services would likely be protected, public transit, garbage collection, city maintenance, services to the poor and much else would be cut back.
While that might seem a painful but necessary course, the long-term consequences could be even more damaging. As with any bankruptcy, Detroit would have a very hard time raising money through bonds, meaning it would have no funds for future projects such as bridges or sewers.
An excess of success How did things get this bad? The tale, as told by Lyke Thompson, director of the Center for Urban Studies at Wayne State, is familiar: The automobile industry was so successful through much of the 20th century that it suffocated all other economic activity, turning Detroit into a one-industry town.
But that left the government and economy exposed when foreign competition and corporate mismanagement brought down GM and Chrysler.
Now, he maintains, Detroit's and Michigan's future hinges on encouraging emerging entrepreneurs through a co-ordinated municipal, regional and state industrial-investment strategy.
"We have to demonstrate some collective intelligence," he said.
"You're not going to see a blossoming of hundreds of successful entrepreneurs in short order without a coherent strategy to support their investments."
He rejects utterly the notion that the United States or any other advanced economy can abandon manufacturing.
"An economy that stops making things and that relies instead on providing services, from taking in each other's laundry to lending each other money, is a society doomed to impoverishment," he said.
"You have to collectively decide to go after new manufacturing in new ways."
Prof. Thompson sees some evidence of such coherence among governments, universities, medical centres, private foundations and the other potential engines of diversification. "But we still have a long way to go."
The way out
Must Detroit fail? Has it declined too far to ever return to prosperity? The answer, perhaps, can be found across campus, at a new engineering research centre, filled with robotics labs and clean rooms, where researchers are conducting experiments in alternative energy, nano-science and biotechnology.
This despite savage cuts to university budgets from a straitened state government.
"We have a brilliant faculty who are out there in the market ... raising money for the College of Engineering," said Ralph Kummler, dean of Wayne State's College of Engineering.
It can be found at Tech One, housed in a formerly vacant building where the Chevrolet Corvette was designed, but which today incubates 98 entrepreneurial startups, including Asterand, which harvests waste tissues from hospitals and then makes them available for medical and pharmaceutical research.
It can be found at NextEnergy, a non-profit industry accelerator that works with businesses to develop commercially viable alternative-energy products.
Vice-President Joe Biden visited here earlier this month, part of the Obama administration's rollout of $2.4-billion (U.S.) in grants for electric-vehicle research. More than half of that money, $1.3-billion, will flow to Michigan.
Keith Cooley, president and CEO of NextEnergy, is confident that the foundations of a new economy for Detroit and Michigan have already been laid.
"It's going to take a little while to get wound up, but it will," he predicts.
There are even signs of life in the downtown. The Eastern Market thrives with local farmers on weekends. A few developers have taken over abandoned industrial buildings and turned them into loft condos.
According to one study, 83 per cent of new arrivals to Detroit have a college degree or higher.
Michigan remains a global leader in automotive-technology research, with a large pool of highly skilled engineers. The challenge is to use that resource to reinvent America's manufacturing base, and to make sure that enough of the jobs that flow from that reinvention remain in Michigan to restore the state's economy, along with a more confident sense of its future.
"In 10 years you will see a dramatic renaissance in Michigan's economy, driven by a renewable-energy environment," Keith Cooley at NextEnergy predicts.
Michigan's future, and possibly Ontario's, depends on him being right.

EDUCATIONAL BANKRUPTCY
Along with the city, the Detroit Public School system is also considering declaring bankruptcy.
DPS is losing 10 per cent of its student base annually to private schools, charter schools and suburban schools. It is $260-million (U.S.) in debt, and is mired in a corruption scandal. Seven people have been charged with embezzlement and other crimes as part of a continuing police investigation, and prosecutors warn many more charges are to come.
"What did surprise us is how rampant, how overt and how conspicuous and downright bold-faced the corruption is allegedly," Wayne County prosecutor Kym Worthy said at a press conference.
Arne Duncan, the U.S. Secretary of Education, has called Detroit's public schools a "national disgrace."
Earlier this year, Robert Bobb arrived as emergency financial manager, after the state government suspended many of the powers of the school board. So far, Mr. Bobb has closed 29 schools and announced 2,900 layoffs. He wants the Detroit Teachers Federation to accept a range of new measures in order to balance the books and reverse declining enrolment. The current requirement to lay off younger and more enthusiastic teachers while retaining older, underperforming teachers "is a huge issue for us," he said in an interview.
But Keith Johnson, president of the Detroit Teachers Federation, warns that declaring bankruptcy could destroy public education in Detroit.
"When you declare bankruptcy, you're saying to parents: 'We can't afford to educate your child,'" he said. It could turn the chronic leak of students out of the Detroit public school system into a flood.

Listing agent: Julie Kinnear, Royal LePage Real Estate Services Ltd.
This modest 1½-storey residence drew big crowds looking for an affordable property in a prime area of Roncesvalles Village close to schools, local shops and parks as well as friendly neighbours, agent Julie Kinnear says.
"It's a detached [house] ... for the price of what semis go for," she says. "It meant that it was a wider lot, so you get a bigger yard and parking at the back."
The more than century old Victorian cottage was topped up in the 1980s, so there is now 1,338 square feet of living space, including three bedrooms and two bathrooms.
"It was really meant for a couple or a couple with one kid," Ms. Kinnear says.
Classic details, such as its brick façade, decorative gable and covered porch, are complemented with new roofing and Thermopane windows. "It has great curb appeal," the agent says.
Inside, a new furnace was brought in, the plumbing and wiring were redone, and hardwood floors were recently installed in the second-floor bedrooms.
That includes the master suite, which was designed with dramatic vaulted ceilings and clerestory windows, along with an ensuite bathroom, walk-in closet and walkout to a private sundeck.
On the main level, the foyer is flanked by a guest bedroom and open living room.
Behind the dining room is a kitchen with slate floors and a walkout to a deck, fully fenced backyard and detached garage. Extra kitchen cabinetry, a new gas line and gas stove were added about two years ago.
The 819-square-foot basement contains a laundry area, open recreation room and separate rear exit.

Full text: An award-winning cottage by architects Adam and Katja Thom 'lives lightly' on its rocky Georgian Bay site
In the best Georgian Bay tradition, long-time cottagers are fiercely protective of their secluded chunk of rock. They face down furious storms, dive unflinchingly into chilly water and maintain a rather casual relationship with bathing suits.
The Thom family embraces that heritage during summers on a long, slender island comprising slightly less than three acres of granite not far from Pointe au Baril.
Molly's Cabin, as the cottage has come to be known, measures approximately 1,000 square feet. It blends the customs of an old Georgian Bay camp with the ideals of a spare, modern dwelling.
Molly Thom spent a recent morning baking a pie of hand-picked blueberries as friends, grandkids and pets created a blur of activity inside and out. When a couple of fishermen motor by offshore, everyone pauses to stare.
"That's what happens when you're used to having the whole place to yourself," says Molly's son and co-designer of the cottage, Adam Thom.
Adam and wife Katja Aga Sachse Thom are the principals of Toronto-based architectural firm Agathom Co. The husband and wife team met while both were students at the Southern California Institute of Architecture in Los Angeles.
Their daughters, three-year-old Tilly and 10-month-old May, are spending much of the summer in this recently completed cabin, which is an extension of Thom family custom.
For many years, Molly and her kids spent their summers on Georgian Bay. They rented in different settings before they settled on a 100-year-old classic cottage and she purchased the property.
Renting allowed the family to experience many different parts of the archipelago, Adam says.
"Our favourites were always ... with the big water."
They all loved the old, timeworn cottage but the channel in front was a main thoroughfare for boats, which seemed to become bigger and noisier every year. So after a few years they began the search for a quieter spot.
The family decided on an island so out of the way that they are accustomed to going for days at a time without seeing any people other than each other.
The island has the big water on one side, a series of sheltered lagoons on another, and a wild, beautiful marsh nearby.
When the family purchased the property in 1999, it accommodated four small cottages. Those rundown buildings served for a time while the Thoms analyzed, debated and gradually narrowed their vision toward a shared ideal for a new dwelling.
They were "of a mind" about how to create a convivial cottage, Molly says, but they wrestled with choosing the perfect position.
"We had a hard time siting it," Adam says, explaining that there were advantages to each different scheme.
It was Adam who fixed on the notion of shifting the main cottage to the tip of the island, instead of rebuilding in the middle, where the original sat.
A feeling for how a building sits on the land may partly come from the influence of his father. The late Ron Thom is one of Canada's most acclaimed architects.
Adam has charted his own course in architecture, but as he regards the cabin from afar on a gentle canoe trip around the island, he reflects that he may have absorbed some of that special sense of landscape from his father.
After the family purchased the land, Adam spent three summers on the island before he gave in to a growing conviction that he had found a superior setting to the more obvious location for building.
"First I had to convince Katja," he says, adding that she quickly saw the merits of the new site. It was harder to persuade his mother.
"Molly went kicking and screaming. She had cherished spots already."
Still, she listened to her son, and once they had decided to shift the location to the extreme end of the island, the design presented itself, they all agree.
"The site told us the way the layout would be," Adam says.
In building techniques and dimensions, however, they drew from the local vernacular.
The new location achieves many things: The cottage is bordered by water on three sides. It sits very close to the shore so that light hitting the water is reflected back into the living room and people sitting inside can see and hear the lapping waves. A dramatic piece of granite juts up in front of the living room to provide a sense of shelter from rough weather and a natural screen.
"It kind of nestles you in it," Adam says of the building's position behind the vertical rock face. "Otherwise it's a very, very exposed part of the world."
In fair weather the family slides back the living room's glass windows to create a screened porch.
The location is the right choice, they all agree. Her son was absolutely right, Molly says now.
While the cottage is small, the architects found ways to make it seem as if there is lots of space. Having more than one entrance to the living room, for example, makes that room feel bigger. The flat ledge of granite outside the living room window gives the impression of an extended floor space.
Renting different cottages also allowed them to draw up a list of their most and least favourite features from each property.
"There's a lot of cooking and baking going on up here and our kitchens were always small and out of the way," Molly says. "I wanted a kitchen where three people could cook because that's the fun - all the chopping and nattering."
The cottage has one bedroom with its own exterior door so that an early-rising occupant can slip out for a swim without waking anyone sleeping inside. Guests can also continue the Georgian Bay custom of taking their flashlights and heading off to one of the original sleeping cabins.
Upstairs, a small loft provides an office space that allows the architects to take their work to Georgian Bay.
Molly got her wish for a large kitchen. Outside is a terrace that catches the early sun - just as she had at the previous cottage. She and her friends continue to enjoy the morning ritual of sitting at the picnic table with a selection of cookbooks.
"It was traditional to sit there in your white nightgown and straw hat and drink coffee for all hours while you plan menus," she says.
Their former century cottage also provided a starting point.
"We felt there was so much to be learned from that," Katja says.
For one thing, the oldest cottages were very simply made of wood, with only the most rustic of finishes. There was no drywall and no spa-style bathrooms.
"The inaccessibility really limits the materials you can bring to the site."
Still, the architects note, the cottage is a modern dwelling. The old camp cabins did not have walls made almost entirely of glass.
Katja had the idea of pulling down a corner of the roof to partly enclose the dining room. The design is reminiscent of a tent flap that breaks the wind and anchors the building from the exterior while framing the view of a natural rock garden from the interior.
"The beauty of the landscape can start right at the building. It's not all about bringing the distant view in," she says. "People used to build tents on platforms, so it's still part of the vernacular."
Inside, the wood walls and floors are made from reclaimed barn boards.
The cottage is off the electrical grid, with light, heat and tap water coming from a combination of solar energy, lanterns, propane lamps and a wood stove.
An outhouse has a composting toilet, which means the island doesn't need a costly and destructive septic bed.
The exterior of the cottage is built of Ontario white cedar.
"It's going silver as intended," Adam says.
The Ontario Association of Architects awarded Molly's Cabin with a design excellence award for 2009.
"The cottage represents the legacy of the simple little shed in an isolated island community but with a more exuberant, expressive form," the jury said in making the award. "It lives lightly on this site."
Eventually the younger generation will take over the cottage. Adam says that plan also figured into the design because he and Katja had to anticipate how their use of the island will evolve in years to come.
"I kind of felt this weird pressure for my future self," Adam says.
The youngest members of the family are already well-immersed in cottage ways. While May plays on the terrace, Tilly scampers across the rocks and paddles in the shallow water.
Katja says her daughter will start swimming lessons in the fall in preparation for many summers to come. Last year, her mother says, Tilly talked about the cottage all winter long.
"The people who love the cottage most are Tilly and her Granny."

Full text: After the 'correction,' the high-end market marches on. Kerry Gold reports
With the recent sale of the $6-million home once owned by former NHL player Russ Courtnall, realtors in the niche luxury market have hope that their market is rebounding.
The 9,560 sq. ft. home at 3120 Humber Road is located in Victoria's tony Uplands neighbourhood and features a 1,500-bottle wine cellar, movie theatre, seven bedrooms, eight bathrooms and five fireplaces. When the Courtnalls hosted the Courtnall Classic golf tournament to raise money for mental health care, their guests at the house included celebrities Kiefer Sutherland, Wayne Gretzsky and Pamela Anderson.
Both Russ and Geoff Courtnall have contributed to the renewed confidence in the luxury end of the Victoria market. A Victoria home once owned by former NHL player Geoff Courtnall sold previously in a private sale for $6.5 million, making it the highest price paid for a home in the Greater Victoria area so far this year.
"Everything seems to be selling better these last two months on the island here," says Scott Piercy, who opened the Sotheby's real estate office with fellow realtor James LeBlanc two years ago. "The change has come -- people are optimistic."
Because of its temperate climate and ocean views, Victoria is one of Canada's most desirable places to live, especially for retirees. Last year Sotheby's in Victoria sold 77 waterfront properties; this year, the luxury real estate agency sold 82.
"This year is our best year, without a doubt," says Mr. Piercy.
While international buyers continue as usual to scope the market, the purchasers have been mostly local, he adds.
In Vancouver, Sotheby's realtor Jamie MacDougall says sales have also picked up, despite the usually slow summer months.
"There has been a correction," says Mr. MacDougall. "Between October and February I'd say is when the correction happened, and since then there have been significant sales. Depending on where you are looking, whether it's Shaughnessy or Point Grey or waterfront in West Vancouver, I'd say [a correction of] 10 to 15 per cent."
The motivation to buy is a combination of low interest rates (a five-year fixed rate could be had for 3.69 per cent a month ago) and, compared to prices at the height of the market, there are deals to be had.
As an example of the type of deal out there, Mr. MacDougall says a West Vancouver house that was on the market for $5.8 million a year ago recently sold for $4.9 million. Geoff Courtnall's home may have sold for $6.5 million, but it was assessed at $7.2 million, making it a relative bargain.
Developers of high-end properties have had to adjust to the slowdown over the last year, but Victoria's multiple award-winning Abstract Developments has recently sold two of its luxury Edgecliffe Estate properties. The houses are priced between $2.5 million and $3.5 million and belong to the first new subdivision in the expensive seaside Oak Bay area in a decade, says Marketing director Todd MacKenzie. He says the company has evolved into building custom homes for clients rather than focusing on speculative properties, because there is less risk. With a custom home, typically the consumer has their own financing in place.
Abstract continues to develop high-end speculative properties, however. Its 16-unit West Coast style Terra Verde townhome development within walking distance of downtown Victoria is under construction, and there have been four pre-sales so far.
"There is some improvement in the $800,000 to $1.5 million market," says Mr. MacKenzie. "Why? Because rates are at an all-time low. And you probably have seen a 10 per cent correction in the prices of homes. People are starting to realize that it has hit bottom where we are."
Other than the correction to land prices, labour is also less costly than it was during the boom, making it possible for developers to adjust prices. And when a market corrects, it's always a better deal to move up, which is what savvy buyers already know. It's a matter of simple mathematics.
"When the market corrects 10 to 15 per cent, if you are moving up, you have won," says Mr. MacKenzie. "Because if you are selling a $1 million house and it's dropped to $900,000, and then you buy a $2 million house that you got for $1.8 million, you just made $100,000.
"For people moving up, this can be to their advantage."

Full text:   Chinese fugitive says there is simply no chance of obtaining a fair trial in China
The short, stocky, former high-rolling peasant, cited by many as a major factor in this country's prickly relations with the People's Republic of China, says he would have been executed long ago if he had not managed to flee to Canada.
In a wide-ranging, no-holds-barred interview with The Globe and Mail this week, his first since news emerged of his ex-wife's return to China, China's most wanted fugitive admitted skirting the law by using loopholes to avoid paying taxes.
But Lai Changxing said there was simply no chance of obtaining a fair trial in China, where authorities accuse him of masterminding one of the largest Chinese smuggling operations in the last 50 years.
"In China, once the government presumes you are guilty, they arrest you, and that's it," said Mr. Lai, on the eve of the 10th anniversary of his dramatic flight to Vancouver with his then-wife and three teenaged children. "If I had not been in Canada, I would be dead by now."
As it is, despite Chinese government assurances that he will not be executed or physically harmed if sent back, Mr. Lai remains here - at least for the time being, thanks to a Federal Court of Appeal ruling that he could face torture back in China.
Mr. Lai claims the extent of his previous wealth and business operations has been exaggerated.
Nonetheless, he was once cock of the walk in the wild, booming city of Xiamen on China's southeast coast, swimming in dough, holding sway over a legendary pleasure palace known as the Red Mansion, and applauded by locals for helping old people and bringing in a professional soccer team.
But according to Mr. Lai, he did little more than many other enterprising private businessman during China's unrestrained economy of the 1990s, a time when Deng Xiaoping famously declared that "to get rich is glorious."
"I just wanted to make money," he said, noting that all the goods he imported were ordinary consumer products. No drugs, no weapons. "They were not harmful to society. But, like everyone else, you want to avoid taxes, if you can. What I did, I believe other people back then were doing as well.
"There were too many loopholes in the Chinese system. Everyone wanted to make lots of money. If there had been no loopholes, I believe I would have paid all those taxes." He added that most of his income came from real-estate developments, not from his lucrative import business.
Regardless of what he did wrong, Mr. Lai said, punishment he would face in China is out of all proportion to what took place. Nine alleged accomplices have already been executed, a fact that weighs heavily on the 51-year-old former millionaire with a Grade 4 education.
"They were not guilty. They had nothing to do with me. But the Chinese government said they were involved, so they had no chance. So many victims, so many families destroyed. Can you imagine?"
Mr. Lai's own family has been affected. Several members were jailed over their association with Mr. Lai. His older brother died in custody. And his mother-in-law was sentenced to two years in prison for sending 300,000 Hong Kong dollars to her three grandchildren in Vancouver, while Mr. Lai and his wife were being held at a remand centre.
Mr. Lai said he would gladly stand trial in Canada, where he can present his side of the case and, if found guilty, expect punishment along the lines of paying back taxes, a large fine, and maybe some time in jail.
In China, however, he was declared guilty long ago, with then-premier Zhu Rongji saying he should be executed three times over. Human-rights advocates have consistently decried the lack of accountability in China's judicial system. A report last year by the U.S. State Department said Chinese courts are particularly biased "in high-profile or politically sensitive cases."
Mr. Lai's continued presence in Canada is often cited by Chinese officials as an obstacle in the establishment of better relations between the two countries.
In an unexpected twist to the case, Ms. Lai's former wife and mother of their children, Tsang Mingna, recently went back on her own to China with the couple's 23-year-old daughter. Their two sons are still in Vancouver. Ms. Tsang had been charged as a co-conspirator with her husband. Her status now is unclear.
"Her parents are getting old," said Mr. Lai. "I don't want to talk any more about it, but she is innocent. She is only a housewife. Hers was just one of the names I put on the papers you have to submit when you form a company. Even though we are divorced, I still miss her. I don't know if we will ever see each other again."
These days, Mr. Lai's life is far removed from the good times in Xiamen. China has confiscated most of his money and possessions. He now lives a relatively bare-bones existence in a non-descript Vancouver apartment, surviving with the help of friends and some real-estate consulting. But he's alive.
"I miss my hometown, but I've been here 10 years. I'm used to it now. In Canada, there is justice."
He does not believe Chinese assurances that he will be allowed to serve out a long term in prison without harm. For the first year or two, because of media attention, nothing is likely to happen, Mr. Lai said. "But after that, I'll be gone. When I die, no one will really know."
In the meantime, now that he has a Canadian work permit, Mr. Lai says he is looking forward to, of all things, paying taxes. "Of course I will pay them. I will be very glad to pay taxes in Canada."

Full text:   The departure of Nortel Networks Corp.'s CEO and most of its board marks the effective end of the 124-year-old company. But the remarkable aspect is that Nortel lasted as long as it did, given its rapid descent from national hero to national disgrace.
"I knew when I joined the board it was high-risk," said Harry Pearce, who stepped down as chairman yesterday after four years as a Nortel director. The litigation lawyer - a former chairman of Hughes Electronics and a former vice-chairman of General Motors - said he was under no illusions when he came on board in January, 2005, after a major accounting scandal had pushed Nortel close to the brink.
"I knew it would produce enormous litigation exposure. I suspected it was going to be extremely expensive to settle all that."
That reflects the feeling within the current Nortel team - that they inherited a mess in terms of a weakened market, an accounting crisis and skeptical investors. The line from both management and board is: We made the best of a bad situation, but external events sealed our fate.
Mike Zafirovski said when he became CEO in 2005 that he felt there was a 30- to 40-per-cent chance Nortel would not survive. "You are not going to be losing market share in everything you have - with a B-minus credit, a weak balance sheet - and say it would be a guaranteed success," he said.
During the current economic crisis, it is common for managers to blame their predicaments on external events. Yet the question remains: Should the current board and management have done more to prepare for those events?
Mr. Zafirovski says he might have pressed harder to raise cash and increase the scale of Nortel so that it could compete with big international rivals. It came close to acquisitions, but the price was always too high, in his opinion.
When the financial meltdown hit global telecom markets last year, Nortel was already exposed. It was "devastating" to file for bankruptcy protection, Mr. Zafirovski said. "We moaned and groaned and said life is unfair. But there is a sense of pulling ourselves up by the bootstraps and saying, 'By God, we would do the best we can with a new set of cards.' "
For Mr. Pearce, that hand was already dangerously weak, including a devastating accounting scandal, that produced multiple financial restatements and the ousting of the company's leadership in 2004. It damaged Nortel's reputation, sapped management resources and left the company with a bill that was to prove too expensive for the coming environment, he said.
In early 2006, he and Mr. Zafirovski sat before a New York federal judge who had been appointed mediator for the shareholder class actions against the company. "We told him flat out, we had no real defence for these actions," Mr. Pearce said. "The conduct of that senior management team was such that in my professional view we had no defences. So our only defence was affordability. We could only provide the amount of settlement dollars that the company could ultimately afford and still survive."
Nortel agreed to a settlement of nearly $2.5-billion (U.S.) - betting that the settlement would clear the way for Nortel's renewal. But several external forces began to play. The settlements left the company with "an extremely delicate and imperilled balance sheet" as the world economy tanked and the global credit market seized up. "The settlement put the company on the brink," Mr. Pearce said.
At the same time, the communications gear industry started to consolidate into larger, global players, and Nortel realized it needed to grow quickly to compete. It tried unsuccessfully to make several acquisitions.
"We knew we had to grow. So we were simultaneously trying to do deals that made sense as we were trying to get everything in order. We came close to some transactions," he said.
Mr. Pearce and executives won't say which players they pursued, but one company that was widely reported as a target several years ago was Avaya Inc. The New Jersey-based company has since undergone a turnaround of its own and has bid $475-million for Nortel's enterprise unit.
Without a major acquisition, Nortel faced a bleak financial picture. As the economy crashed, the company needed quick access to cash, but then the credit markets froze.
The board was left with no other option but to try to sell an asset quickly.
"We didn't have a lot of time to raise a lot of cash once we understood that government support was unlikely, we didn't have any other alternatives. The credit markets were absolutely non-existent," Mr. Pearce said.
Last September, Nortel decided to put one of three divisions on the block. The metro ethernet networks unit makes optical gear for delivering multimedia content over local broadband networks and was one of the fastest-growing portions of the company.
It was a prized asset and several bids came in quickly, but some outsiders suspected that Nortel was close to filing for creditor protection and they offered less than the board was willing to accept.
The complexity of Nortel's situation made it hard for Ottawa to step in with support when the credit markets froze. But the company did seek assistance unsuccessfully once in creditor protection. "It's hard to fault the government," Mr. Pearce said.
The former chairman praises his fellow directors and especially his CEO for efforts over several extremely tense years. "It's sobering," Mr. Pearce added. "We did our best."
That is Mr. Zafirovski's view, too. After the court protection filing, he said he decided to stay as long as it took to stabilize the business. His departure was set in motion in April-May, he said, when it was decided that there should be a streamlining of management and the board in the third quarter.
About two weeks ago, management, board and the court-appointed monitor agreed there was "some elegance" in announcing the resignations at the same time as second-quarter financial results - which Mr. Zafirovski insists were "remarkable," given the circumstances.
But with Mr. Zafirovski gone, it remains to be seen what will happen to the heart and soul of Nortel, the engineers who develop its intellectual property. The multinational bidders for the Nortel units hope they remain - and Mr. Zafirovski insists this should happen.
"What's in it for brilliant engineers is the opportunity to do what they are doing, possibly on a large scale, in a larger theatre," he insists.
As for Mr. Zafirovski, he could see himself as a CEO again, but nothing has been lined up yet. He is ensured of no further compensation from Nortel. He must join other employees in trying to claim a severance package of, theoretically, two years salary.
But there is one sliver of good news. Mr. Zafirovski, who divided his time between Chicago and Toronto, put his Toronto condominium on the market and it sold in one day - at the list price. "At least there is the good news that the Toronto real estate market is progressing well," he said.

HIGH HOPES
Then (2005):
"I'm convinced Nortel will be
a big winner again."
- Mike Zafirovski, Oct. 17, 2005, at a press conference announcing his appointment as president and CEO of Nortel.
Investors reacted with optimism, bidding Nortel's stock up 5.4 per cent to $4.10 on the Toronto Stock Exchange.
Now (2009):
"I am extremely proud to have been associated with this company. The board members and I came to Nortel because we really believed in the value of Nortel's people and technology. Although solid progress was made in many areas, at the end, the capital structure and legacy costs coupled with the economic downturn proved too difficult to surmount."
- Mike Zafirovski, Aug. 10, 2009, announcing his immediate departure .
Nortel's shares were de-listed in June, making them officially worthless. At their peak they traded at the equivalent of $1,245 a share.

Leno's new prime-time show is a panicky manoeuvre by NBC

Full text:   Jay Leno says he feels good. Says he runs four miles a day and has lost a few pounds. Leno is on the stage, alone, facing several hundred TV critics. He makes a few jokes. Some are good. Some are lame. He's doing what he always does - he tries to charm with his quick wit and make friends by being self-deprecating.
It ain't working. Here's the truth - Jay Leno looks old and his act is tired. He even looks physically tired, showing all of his 59 years. On giant screens on either side of him are photos of Leno grinning, his massive chin prominent, and the makeup covering the lines on his smiling face is all too obvious.
What's absurd in this situation is that, at 59 and after 17 years hosting The Tonight Show , this affable, rather ordinary showbiz veteran is at the centre of a seismic shift in American network television. NBC is banking on Leno to successfully change the paradigm of prime-time TV. He'll host what is, so far, a vaguely defined talk show at 10 p.m. That's a prime-time hour - an hour when most people watch TV dramas. NBC believes it can compete by having Leno make jokes, do stunts and interview celebrities, live, five nights a week, 46 weeks of the year starting Sept. 14. NBC is in fourth place among the four U.S. networks. The Leno venture looks like a panicky, desperate manoeuvre.
To say that there is skepticism about the venture is a massive understatement. The competing networks are beside themselves with glee. It's open season on five hours of prime-time real estate, as CBS and ABC see it. (Fox doesn't air anything at 10 p.m.) NBC has surrendered in the drama wars.
As NBC sees it, mind you, Leno's show will be cheap to produce and the important matter is that he will boost ratings for local news at 11 p.m. For local news programs, NBC is saying Leno is "the hottest hand-off" in television.
This is a new business model in network TV. Even as local news gets fewer viewers, NBC is trying to accommodate local affiliates. Unlike a prime-time drama airing at 10 p.m., Leno's live show cannot earn a second bundle of money, in repeats or with DVD sales. Then there's the possibility of Leno undermining the popularity and profitability of The Tonight Show , which Conan O'Brien hosts now, and which airs 35 minutes after Leno is to close down his joke machine at 11 p.m. Who will stick around for it?
But there's another reason, too, one that's far more mundane and says more about cutthroat network machinations. Before Leno comes on the stage to charm critics, NBC executive Rick Ludwin comes on to explain everything. Or spin it, anyway. Asked if Leno won't undercut The Tonight Show , Ludwin is blunt: "The fact of the matter is had Jay not signed this deal with NBC, he'd be on another network, probably opposite The Tonight Show . And then, of course, we wouldn't have been able to control it, and it wouldn't have been friendly. In this scenario it is friendly."
Ludwin claims to have reams of research showing that viewers want comedy at 10 p.m. It's not clear if they wanted Leno's comedy or a sitcom. It's possible that the research is dubious. Ask Americans if they'd watch Leno at 10 p.m. and many would say "yes," because they know his humour from 17 years on The Tonight Show . It doesn't mean that they'll abandon CSI: Miami when it comes time to choose.
Leno is as cocky as anyone in his position could be. He scoffs at the idea that he's going to change the TV landscape and save NBC. "The network's on its own," he cracked. "Screw them! I'm not here to save them." But the confidence seems half-hearted and, frankly, the format for the show seems half-assed.
Most nights there will only be one guest and sometimes two. He won't sit at a desk. There will be "news correspondents" doing funny bits, just like The Daily Show with Jon Stewart . One correspondent will be NBC Nightly News anchor Brian Williams, known as a joker when off the news beat. Another is comic D.L. Hughley, who had a horrible light-news show on CNN a while back.
Leno is particularly enthusiastic about a recurring comedy routine he calls a "green-car challenge." This will involve celebrities racing electric or hybrid cars. Leno says Tom Cruise has shown interest.
But that's it for ideas and innovations. Comedy correspondents and celebrity car races. Both are old and tired ideas, and that still leaves a lot of time to fill in five hour-long shows a week. Over at CBS, as its executives implied earlier this week, they see NBC's Leno venture as insane. As CBS Entertainment President Nina Tassler said of the network's hot drama The Mentalist , which will compete with Leno: "It generates billions of dollars for us in revenue, between foreign sales, syndication." When you're talking billions, you're talking real money in this racket.
Leno ends his session with a stout declaration: "You know, you put your head down, you move forward and you try something new. And, right now, I would rather be doing this than The Tonight Show because I think this is an interesting challenge. It's more fun. We are doing things we couldn't do under the umbrella of The Tonight Show because it wasn't Tonight Show style."
It's a proud boast, meant sincerely, and Leno already looks fed up with the skepticism and the nagging questions. It's notable that he doesn't close with a joke. Perhaps because there's nothing funny about facing failure head-on.

Full text:   Anyone who has ever lived in a condo - or an apartment - knows storage poses a challenge. If you live in a house, you just pile stuff away in the basement, the attic or the garage.
With a condo, however, there are none of these handy spaces to set aside things you may need in future or want to save in case someone else does. Where do you put the Christmas tree, the bicycle, the old rowing machine you thought you would use to trim down or the sofa that is still too good to relegate to a landfill?
The options boil down to three: buy a storage locker in your condo building - if any are still available; rent a cubicle in a public self-storage facility; or see if a friend or relative with a house or garage is willing to store your stuff.
I can't help you with the last one. My basement is full - same with my garage. But I can tell you what the experts say about the other two.
First, storage lockers in condo buildings. Five years ago the price of most new condos included both a storage locker and a parking spot. Those days are fast disappearing. Builders today generally sell storage lockers as separate items.
The cost can range from somewhere just north of $100 to $500 a square foot, depending on the project, says Mark Cohen, senior vice-president at the Condo Store Marketing Systems. At the same time, lockers are larger these days then they were five years ago.
"At one point the city demanded they be large enough to store a bicycle," he says. "So size grew from maybe three feet by five feet to four feet by six feet."
What you get is pretty basic, a cubicle walled by chicken wire or chain link fencing, tucked away in a basement level, although in more upscale projects, lockers have been moved to ground level.
"With quite a few new buildings nowadays they are located behind the lobby. The idea is to make them more accessible to cyclists," he says. "You would be surprised how many Bay Street lawyers cycle to work."
You should also know that there are never as many lockers as there are suites. Builders generally create enough for 60 to 70 per cent of the units and they usually don't sell all that quickly, Mr. Cohen says.
"They are eventually absorbed but it can take the resale market to finally sell them out," he says.
Part of the reason they are not hot ticket items is because some buyers, especially first-timers, are already squeezing nickels to cover down payments, closing costs and all the expenses associated with moving in. Laying out another $2,500 to $5,000 has a low priority. It is often only after living in their suite a while they realize it is storage-challenged.
Which brings us to rentals in self-storage facilities. On the plus side, they come in a range of sizes, are usually climate controlled, are open round-the-clock and have state-of-the-art security.
The downside is that they can be expensive if you need a locker on a long-term basis.
At the new Spaces Self Storage on Eastern Avenue just east of Broadview Avenue in Toronto, a five-foot-by-five-foot cubicle costs $69 a month while the largest (10 by 20) goes for $399. The most popular is probably the five-foot-by-10-foot storage unit, which goes for $155 a month, says Stuart Skeete, operations manager.
He says 60 per cent of Spaces' business comes from the residential sector but condos play a relatively small role. His customers are mainly home owners needing a place to store furniture for future use.
"We are, however, increasingly seeing local condo owners taking units for things like golf clubs and other recreational stuff they don't have room to store in their suites," he says.
Those who rent storage units are generally older and better off financially, says Mike Cowie who has three storage operations in the Greater Toronto area, all under the Self Stor banner.
"First-time buyers are too concerned about just making the down payment, mortgage and monthly maintenance fees to worry about storage space," he says. "Besides most of them have yet to accumulate enough stuff to need storage."
He also says that Canadians are less mobile than our counterparts south of the border and while they are great savers of stuff, their preference is to pack it into a basement or garage - theirs or someone else's.
"In the U.S. there is four square feet of commercial storage space for every man, women and child; in Canada there is just one square foot," he says.
Mind you that may change as the men and women who have bought condos in the past decade start the inevitable process of accumulating stuff. Your much loved but tired old couch just will not fit in a condo storage locker.

Abstract: Havana Boxing Academy, which has produced more than two dozen gold-medal winners in the past quarter-century. Located in a non-glamorous building on the city's outskirts, the academy begins training at a tender age - as young as nine in some instances - and gradually moulds the young athletes into fierce ring warriors. The champions of the future rise or fall at Cuba's National Boxing Championship - one of the country's biggest annual sporting events - but several coaches are concerned.

DOCUMENTARY
Sharkbite Summer
Discovery, 8 p.m.
For reasons scientists still can't fathom, coastal areas in the U.S. and the Caribbean were plagued by shark attacks in the summer of 2001. TV and news media labelled it "Summer of the Shark" and beach alerts were issued. This report reenacts four of the most horrific incidents, including the story of Krishna Thompson, a Wall Street trader on holiday in the Bahamas who fought an attacking shark and survived. The program steers wide of the usual sensationalism - shark attacks were, in fact, lower than average that summer - but it is still grisly viewing.
REALITY
Jurassic Fight Club
History, 8 p.m.
Much loved by young males and fans of CGI technology, Jurassic Fight Club has become one of the most-watched programs on U.S. cable this year. Each episode features a forensic breakdown of what might transpire should two long-extinct species lock horns. Tonight's match-up pits the lumbering Gastonia - a massive beast covered in spikes -against the Utahraptor, the largest known member of the raptor family. Both prehistoric creatures are vicious fighters, though not without weaknesses: The Gastonia has poor vision, while the Utahraptor moves awkwardly.
MOVIE
Crossroads
MuchMusic, 9 p.m.
One of the lesser cinema highlights of 2002, this feature marked the start and finish of Britney Spears's acting career. Working from a script by Shonda Rhimes - who went on to create Grey's Anatomy - the story focuses on three childhood pals on the brink of graduating from a high school somewhere in Georgia. High-spirited Lucy, played by Spears, is planning for college and a double major in biology and chemistry; Mimi (Taryn Manning) is five months pregnant and aimless; and Kit (Zoe Saldana) intends to marry her boyfriend in California. Out of the blue, Mimi announces she wants to audition for a singing gig in California, which sets off a cross-country road trip. The story is lightweight after-school special fare.
HISTORY
Time Team America
PBS, 10 p.m.
Time Team America takes viewers inside archaeological sites with unanswered questions. Tonight's episode travels to Roanoke Island near the coast of North Carolina. The English sent the first group of colonists to the barren location in 1586, but when the British navy returned with supplies three years later, the settlement was empty. The Time Team America experts spend three days in search of clues and shed new light on where the people went.

SATURDAY AUGUST 8
DESIGN
Colin & Justin's Home Heist
HGTV, 7 p.m.
TV's most precocious design duo, Scottish-born Colin McAllister and Justin Ryan, know their stuff. Each episode takes them into a Canadian home in dire need of a design update and neither gent holds back his opinion during the blunt assessment stage. Tonight, the brash pair meet Cathie, a 47-year-old single woman still living in her parents' suburban domicile. The living room resembles a fifties-era hunting lodge, complete with leather curtains and stuffed pheasants. Colin and Justin perform a makeover miracle.
MOVIE
Finding Nemo
ABC, 8 p.m.
Anyone with children under 10 has likely seen this 2003 animated feature, but there's charm in viewing it again. Comic actor Albert Brooks is letter-perfect as the clownfish named Marlin, who loses his son Nemo (Alexander Gould) to a fishing net. Even more adorable is Ellen DeGeneres as Dory, a blue tang with short-term memory loss. Also worth noting is Oscar-winning actor Geoffrey Rush as Nigel the pelican and Willem Dafoe as the hard-edged fish named Gill. A rare mix of great voices, smart writing and brilliant animation.
MYSTERY
The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes: The Three Gables
PBS, 9 p.m.
First broadcast in 1994, this movie stars the beloved Jeremy Brett as the inscrutable English sleuth. Elderly widow Mary Maberley (Mary Ellis) is being pressured to sell her estate and all her possessions. Her refusal is met with threats. As Watson (David Burke) dithers, Holmes deduces that the buyer is working for a wealthy dowager in search of a hidden manuscript. Based on an original tale by Arthur Conan Doyle, the twists in the story may surprise even the most ardent mystery fan.

SUNDAY AUGUST 9
BUSINESS
Inside American Airlines:
A Week in the Life
CNBC, 8 p.m.
Travel expert Peter Greenberg spent one week with a camera crew behind the scenes of American Airlines, which serves two million air travellers a week. He visited the control tower, where air traffic controllers perform the nerve-wracking ballet of instructing planes how and when to set down and take off. Greenberg also sneaks into an American Airlines boardroom and presses execs with a reasonable question: Why do some passengers pay $50 for a flight while others pay ten 10 times that for the seat next to them?
REALITY
Kendra
E!, 10 p.m.
The show follows the daily life of Playboy model Kendra Wilkinson, made famous for fawning over Hugh Hefner in the reality series The Girls Next Door . No less staged, this show follows bubbly Kendra after moving out of the Playboy mansion. Since then she got pregnant and engaged to a football player. On tonight's show, Kendra's mom is shocked to learn of Kendra's pregnancy, and refuses to condone the wedding.
RETRO
Animal House:
The Inside Story
A & E, 10 p.m.
Broadcast last year to commemorate the 30th anniversary of Animal House , this program is worth a second look. Reviled by reviewers, worshipped by the college crowd, Animal House established the frat-boy film genre and elevated Saturday Night Liv e player John Belushi to movie stardom, however fleeting. This retro-special interviews director John Landis and several of the film's stars, including Kevin Bacon and Karen Allen.
BIOGRAPHY
This is ... Victoria Beckham
Star!, 11 p.m.
The fabulous life of Victoria Beckham is explored in this tawdry if entertaining profile. The program touches briefly on her days as a Spice Girl (she was Posh Spice, you may recall) and her subsequent solo singing career, but there are more details on her marriage to soccer star David Beckham. Since their 1999 nuptials, Ms. Beckham has produced her own line of designer jeans, followed by jewellery, handbags, sunglasses and a fragrance called Intimately Beckham.

MONDAY AUGUST 10
REALITY
Cribs
MTV, 7 p.m.
An MTV staple since 2000, Cribs has conducted more than 200 tours of celebrity homes. Some of the visits are revealing (the episode showcasing Mariah Carey's New York penthouse was an appalling display of designer excess), while some are clearly orchestrated for the camera (rapper 50 Cent admitted that the three Ferraris in his garage were really loaners). Tonight's show is "All-Canuck," beginning with a tour of bad-boy hockey player Sean Avery's home, followed by visits with Spawn creator Todd McFarlane and former Kids in the Hall member Kevin McDonald. AWARDS
Teen Choice Awards
Global, Fox, 8 p.m.
Be prepared to surrender the converter to teen viewers for two hours tonight. Now in its 11th year, the annual awards fête is hosted by the Jonas Brothers, which will likely result in a spike in ratings. Besides the Jonas boyos, the show is scheduled to include a stage turn from the Black Eyed Peas. As in years past, the broadcast will bestow a dozen or so Teen Choice trophies - which resemble a surfboard - to hot young stars in film and TV. And in a sign of the times, a new category, Choice Twit, will honour the top celebrity Tweeter on Twitter.
DOCUMENTARY
Altered by Elvis
Bravo!, 9 p.m.
The Elvis legend lives on. This offbeat documentary profiles individuals whose lives were changed forever by Elvis Presley and his music. The subjects include a woman named Vicki, who talks about moving from Milwaukee, Wis., to Memphis, Tenn., just to be closer to Presley's aura. The strangest interviewee, though, is Larry Geller, Elvis's former hairstylist, who still seems bound to the past. Geller speaks of Presley in awestruck tones and proudly announces he was one of very few people to touch the King's dead body.
COMEDY
Chris Rock: Kill the
Messenger
HBO Canada, 9:30 p.m.
Chris Rock validates his rank as the best standup in comedy today with this special. Filmed during Rock's 2008 comedy tour, the special merges performances from London, Johannesburg and New York, edited into one seamless show. Pacing back and forth on stage, rarely taking a break, Rock discourses on the possibility of a black president (the show was taped before Obama's presidential victory last November), bottled water, minimum-wage jobs, the absurdity of high gas prices and people with annoying cellphone ringtones. His closing segment, in which he talks about sex between married couples, may be among the most honest assessments of relationships ever made by a comedian.

TUESDAY AUGUST 11
MYSTERY
Murder She Wrote
Vision, 7 p.m.
Genteel sleuth Jessica Fletcher, played by Angela Lansbury, tackles one of her most challenging cases in this third-season episode. Jessica comes to the aid of her nephew, Grady (Michael Horton), who's in a bind. Grady is working at a New York accounting firm with a dodgy reputation. One of the owners accused of "cooking the books" turns up dead and police designate Grady as the prime suspect. Jessica discovers that a homeless man known to sneak into the firm's offices in off-hours may have witnessed the murder.
SCIENCE
NOVA
PBS, 8 p.m.
The acclaimed science series looks back at the deadliest accident in aviation history. On March 27, 1977, on the Spanish island of Tenerife, two jumbo jets collided on a fog-enshrouded runway, resulting in the deaths of 583 people. The NOVA experts rewind the clock to several hours before the accident, which seems to have been a result of bad luck. One of the biggest factors in the crash was a terrorist bomb threat earlier that day at a nearby airport, which diverted most air traffic to Tenerife; the understaffed control tower in Tenerife was simply overwhelmed. The program also interviews several survivors and looks at the improvements made to runway safety.
NATURE
Against The Elements
Discovery, 9 p.m.
Originally produced for the U.S. Science Channel, this series runs the gamut of natural disasters - all caught on film. Tonight's show features footage of a spectacular fire at a fireworks factory, followed by scenes of a sailor sucked into an airplane engine and a tsunami wreaking devastation on a small town. The capper: clips of a skier being buried alive by an avalanche. DRAMA
Medium
NBC, 10 p.m.
Medium stars Patricia Arquette as Allison Dubois, a wife and mother of three young girls. Allison also possesses a hidden talent: She sees dead people, who come to her in dreams and reveal details of heinous crimes. Allison is regularly conscripted by local police to assist on tough cases. Tonight sees the return of the long-deceased FBI Agent Cooper (Kurtwood Smith of That '70s Show ) who sneaks back into Allison's dreams to pass on tips about a killer. For the first time, however, Allison is suspicious of the dead man's motives.

WEDNESDAY AUGUST 12
FOOD
Chef at Home
Food Network, 7 p.m.
Unlike many TV chefs, whose solitary goal seems to be promote their restaurants or cookbooks, Michael Smith has a genuine passion for all things food-related. In this show, he invites viewers into his home kitchen to school them on the preparation of uncomplicated meals. Tonight's episode is a personal affair. His young son Gabe has come down with a nasty cold, which inspires Smith to play doctor daddy. Leafing through his old cookbooks, he prepares homemade chicken soup and follows with comfort food, including warm bread pudding and matzo balls, and wraps up the meal with homemade brown-sugar ice cream.
COMEDY
Waiting for God
PBS, 7:30 p.m.
This BBC sitcom celebrates the golden years of several very British characters. Originally broadcast from 1990 to 1994, the series is set at an English retirement home and revolves around the principal characters of Diana Trent, a feisty retired photographer, and Tom Ballard, a former accountant on the lam from his dysfunctional family. In most episodes, the unlikely soulmates combine forces against the retirement home management, which seems intent on depriving the residents of all dignity. In tonight's show, Diana breaks her hip and must have an operation. Faced with the ignominy of attending her niece's upcoming wedding with a walker, she decides to derail the ceremony instead. For any age, that's thinking outside the box.
DOCUMENTARY
Wide Angle:
Victory is Your Duty
PBS, 10 p.m.
The Wide Angle cameras go inside the famed Havana Boxing Academy, which has produced more than two dozen gold-medal winners in the past quarter-century. Located in a non-glamorous building on the city's outskirts, the academy begins training at a tender age - as young as nine in some instances - and gradually moulds the young athletes into fierce ring warriors. The champions of the future rise or fall at Cuba's National Boxing Championship - one of the country's biggest annual sporting events - but several coaches are concerned. Some feel that the stepping-down of Fidel Castro last year was the beginning of the end of Cuba's boxing program. Time will tell.
LITERATURE
Speaking Volumes
Bravo!, 10 p.m.
Full marks go to this documentary celebrating the works of fiction writers from Newfoundland and Labrador. Directed by Ken Pittman, the film profiles rising talents like Lisa Moore, Wayne Johnston and Michael Crummey, whose work has struck a chord with literary devotees in Canada and all points abroad. The film interviews the authors and features scenes from their book readings. The short explanation for their success: Newfoundlanders are simply grand storytellers.

THURSDAY AUGUST 13
MOVIE
Camp Hollywood
Bravo!, 4 p.m.
Painfully real, this 2004 oddity goes inside Hollywood's infamous Highland Gardens Hotel, a rundown establishment known for aspiring actors. In ragged fashion, the film follows Canadian standup/filmmaker Steve Markle, who checks in for a two-month stay in the middle of "pilot season," the period when U.S. networks are casting for shows. Along with his new neighbours, Markle attends audition after audition and is turned down flat. Markle also trains his camera on several of the Highland's longtime residents, some of whom have been waiting for their big break for over a decade. A touching mix of pathos and showbiz surrealism.
DOCUMENTARY
Somali Pirate Takedown: The Real Story
Discovery, 9 p.m.
The whole world watched and waited last April when a handful of Somali pirates seized the cargo ship Maersk Alabama, which was en route to Kenya. The crisis ended a few days later when the three remaining pirates were shot dead by U.S. Navy Seal snipers while holding captain Richard Phillips hostage onboard a lifeboat. This special recounts the rescue mission in detail and features the first broadcast interviews with Captain Phillips and other members of the crew. DOCUMENTARY
On a Wind and a Prayer
PBS, 9 p.m.
Now here's a war story not found in most history books: During the height of the Second World War, the Japanese military were developing deadly ballistic missiles attached to balloons for use against American targets. The devices, known as "Fugo" balloons, were hydrogen-powered and carried payloads capable of mass destruction; there were also plans for the balloons to carry biochemical weapons. The military experts interviewed in this program estimate the Japanese released 9,000 of the weapons into the Pacific Jet Stream, with the long-range goal of reaching the U.S. The really scary part: There are apparently more than 600 still out there somewhere, and many are still active.
REALITY
LA Ink
TLC, 10 p.m.
Tattoo artist Kat Von D is the reason to watch this reality show about the body-art subculture. This series follows her struggles to operate High Voltage Tattoo, a studio in downtown Los Angeles. The show has a steady realistic feel and in one episode last season, Kat broke a Guinness World Record by tattooing 400 people in 24 hours. In tonight's episode, Kat airlifts in tattoo artist Dan Smith to run the studio while she heads to New York to promote her new fragrance line. Without Kat's strong presence, however, the place quickly becomes a Lord of the Flies scenario.

Listing agent: Michael O'Brien, Bosley Real Estate Ltd.
Agent and local resident Michael O'Brien has seen several updated Victorians in Cabbagetown, but this is semi-detached version had a more memorable makeover than the rest.
"That was an incredibly glamorous renovation," the agent says. "And it had a couple of really unusual features."
That includes a 30-foot-long hall lined with glass block windows and a third-floor loft with a skylight, a Juliet balcony and a screened-in porch with an exit to a sundeck.
"Victorians in Cabbagetown do tend to be dark," Mr. O'Brien says. "This one was exceptionally bright."
The second-floor den was opened up and given a new bay window, "which was unusual," the agent says. "So that brought in a lot of light."
Outside the century-old residence, water, heating and an upper-level loft space is available in a two-storey coach house. "Those are extremely rare," Mr. O'Brien says.
Back in the house, vintage details include decorative mouldings and an elaborate archway in the main hall, as well as more than 10-foot-high ceilings.
Hardwood floors throughout stop short of the slate in the kitchen and family room. The former also has granite countertops, while the latter features a skylight, wood stove and patio doors. "It felt more like an outdoor room," Mr. O'Brien says.
Rounding out the main floor is a powder room, formal dining room and living room with a gas fireplace.
The second floor has two full bathrooms, including an ensuite.
The unfinished basement has a walkout.

Full text:   Mackenzie King told us that the trouble with Canada was that it had too much geography and not enough population. A land masse larger than that of our southern neighbour, but only one-tenth its population.
That, the political scientists say, is why nothing binds this country together; there's no common theme.
They are wrong. There is a common theme, a link to all of us. It is the hatred of Toronto.
For many Canadians, Toronto is still the place that has all the banks. All the corporate head offices. All the television headquarters. All the magazines. The only national newspapers. All the smartest figures, all the best-paid personalities, all the powerful people, live in Toronto.
Reeling from a six-week garbage strike and a recession-sparked spike in unemployment, Toronto complains that it no longer deserves such criticism. The mighty has fallen.
Has the Centre of the Universe really learned its lesson?
As it happens, this scribbler is well equipped to find out. Born in a Saskatchewan hamlet of 26 souls and raised in small-town B.C., I was the No. 1 product of the Hate Toronto world.
Then, at 58, I finally gave in to filthy Toronto money and landed on Yonge Street.
Now I have been here long enough to realize that, while Toronto may plead with the rest of the country to stop hating it, in fact the feeling is mutual. Toronto is hypocritical.
Toronto dismisses Ottawa as a village populated by politicians, press and swivel servants. The West has dumb dirt farmers, elevated only by Calgary, while beyond the Rockies, everyone is a wacko.
Eastward, we have Quebec, which should really speak English, and the Maritimes, the destination for all those unemployment cheques.
In short, Canada is changing but Toronto's attitude toward it is not.
If you want some concrete evidence that the city of the CN Tower says one thing and does another, consider this: According to its Yellow Pages, Toronto the Good supports 274 churches.
But visit a local newsstand. Even the convenience stores of Rosedale, its richest enclave, offer as well as The Globe and Mail, National Post, Toronto Star, Toronto Sun, a thick weekly tabloid called Now.
It is free and boasts on its front page of having survived "27 independent years." It has coverage of Toronto city hall. A page on cycling. It has a serious piece on science fiction.
It invites readers to public consultations on city-wide zoning bylaws. It covers astrology, "health wart resisters" (whatever they are), movies, stage openings, food and drink and politics - everything that is going on in town.
Now is a serious business. Its masthead page tells us the editor-publisher has a vice-president, creative director, art director, senior designer and director of production services.
It is free, of course, because it survives on advertising. It has all the movie ads, rentals and real estate, golden retriever puppies, acting classes and The Pillow Fight League, "looking for eight, entertaining, athletic outgoing females with personality to join the roster! TV deal on horizon."
The masthead also lists a controller, a systems analyst, four marketing executives, a human resources manager, a payables co-ordinator and four designers.
And page 142 offers ads: "Pretty Asian and Caucasian girls 19+ wanted for busy agency. Earn what you're worth!" And "Urgent! Hiring female escorts 18+ Make up to $7,000 per week!"
There are, in all, 102 employees listed on Now's masthead. Plus 23 names lumped together under "delivery."
Page 147: "$45 Hot Brunettes & Blondes @ Toronto's newest & hottest massage!" Not to mention "Gorgeous Korean girls 19+ $40 for 30 mins."
There are, in the Greater Toronto Area with all its massive suburbs, some six million residents.
But the city itself has just over two million, half of whom are women with little interest in information such as that on page 150:
"French Girls. Always open. Jacqueline Misa Gabrielle Melody Bella Rayne. Hiring Ladies & Drivers 19+" And "Nighttime is the right time @ the Devil's Playground, Toronto's party headquarters! Cold beer, hot women. Up to 30 Beautiful Girls (19+) Available to Entertain You!"
The ads are in full colour, decorated with boobs and buttocks. "Victoria Park & Danforth Area. Dino-mite special 40 mins ... Only $80 F/S"
Let's say the one million Toronto men can be broken down into roughly equal groups: one-third who are under 20 and not available plus one-third who are over 50 and not interested.
That leaves a target audience of about 300,000. What a coincidence: Now claims to have "321,000 weekly readers - verified audit circulation."
So the Yellow Pages may contain 274 churches, but the 16 full pages of sex-trade advertising in Now show that Toronto also supports at least 388 houses of prostitution.
Is that not hypocrisy?

With the fate of 1 Bloor in doubt, just one plea: not another a parking lot

Author: John Bentley Mays

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/with-fate-1-bloor-doubt-just-one-plea-not-another/docview/382615035/se-2?accountid=14656

The mighty hotel and condominium tower proposed for the southeast corner of Toronto's Yonge and Bloor streets crossing appears to be doomed. Amid a snowstorm of legal paperwork last week, Bazis International, the Kazakhstan-based developer of the high-rise, blaming hard times, seemed on the brink of surrendering the vacant lot. The potential buyer has so far not been named. It could be the consortium of local creditors that has been publicly battling Bazis the past few weeks.
What the new owner will do with the site has not been announced. But certain scenarios, most of them gloomy, come to mind.
It could be the location of a new tall building as numbingly mediocre as the existing office towers on the north side of the intersection. But if the local consortium gets the property, this may not come to pass: The financier leading the charge against Bazis is Gary Berman, who is also an organizer of the annual Pug Awards for worst and best new Toronto architecture. Mr. Berman certainly knows something about good tall-building design and what makes a good city - though how much artistic influence he has over his business partners, if any, is unknown at this point.
The Bloor-Yonge site, at the heart of Toronto's urban geography and historical sense of itself, could also become merely the setting for a condominium spire no better than what was proposed for it in the first place. Architect Roy Varacalli's design of 1 Bloor East, as the 80-storey luxury condo project is called, has gone through a few iterations, all of them routine, none inspiring. Toronto deserves better. We are living in a remarkably inventive, vivid moment in the history of international skyscraper design, and Toronto's most famous intersection would be an ideal location for a stellar expression of this lively artistic thinking.
The most dismal outcome of this affair would be a new parking lot. Over the past decade, Toronto real estate developers have done a good job of ridding the city of these eyesores, and the idea of actually adding one is, or should be, unthinkable.
But almost as bad as a parking lot would be the use suggested this month in the Toronto Star by urban affairs columnist Christopher Hume. His notion: a new square, sponsored by some civic-minded plutocrat or corporation to save our cash-starved city the bother. This public square would be, in Mr. Hume's view, an opportunity for city hall (which, he correctly notes, has played a puny role in Toronto's so-called cultural renaissance) "to redeem itself and revitalize Bloor and Yonge."
"If we can have a Four Seasons [Centre for the Performing Arts]," Mr. Hume asks, "why not a Royal Bank Square, a Hudson's Bay Plaza, Thomson Place, Weston Way or Pizza-Pizza Piazza?"
One reason is that the scheme wouldn't work.
Busy, controversial Yonge-Dundas Square succeeds not because the place lends vitality to the surrounding area, but because it effectively draws on the dense urban vigour that surges all around it. A Milky Way of electric signs, electronic billboards, a large theatre complex, a host of shops and restaurants, Eaton Centre, Ryerson University, dozens of residential towers in the neighbourhood: All these magnets attract energy, excitement and population to the district, hence into Yonge-Dundas Square. The Bloor-Yonge intersection, on the other hand, is a windy, lifeless wasteland, and that fact will not be changed by turning its southeast corner into a glorified vacant lot.
Another and more important reason is that the last thing downtown Toronto needs is another open-air public space.
We need density, far more people in the urban core, and the multiplication of places for these people to live, work and play. That means more safe, beautiful and liveable skyscrapers, fitted out with a mix of residential and retail uses, especially along the most important inner-city avenues.
Whatever quibbles I have with the design of the 80-storey behemoth Bazis International intended to put up, the building would have brought a much-needed wallop of human density to the corner of Bloor and Yonge. One version of the plan featured, in addition to the condo units and hotel up above, a multiscreen movie theatre and ample retail at street level. These items, too, would have been welcome as added attractions to the structure and as added resistance to the increasingly unsustainable outbound pull of suburbia.
The world financial crisis was bound to hurt Toronto. The probable collapse of the 1 Bloor East project is not the first local real-estate casualty of the international turmoil and it may not be the last. But this event will serve some higher purpose if it provokes new, substantial public discussion about the city we want and are willing to fight for.

In a nearly decade-old building at the corner of Richmond and Sherbourne streets, this one-bedroom plus den unit was a magnet for first-time buyers, says agent Boris Kholodov.
The ninth floor suite offers almost 700-square-feet of living space inside and extra room outdoors.
"It is a typical unit for the building, except it had a very nice balcony ... which is something that not many suites in the building have," says Mr. Kholodov.
The open concept residence is "decorated nicely" with built-in shelves in the principal room, a breakfast bar in the kitchen, and laminate and ceramic floors throughout, Mr. Kholodov states.
For privacy, there is a master bedroom with a walk-in closet.
The unit also comes with a four-piece bathroom and en suite laundry facilities, plus a locker and underground parking.
Each month, $338 pays for utility costs and upkeep of common areas, such as the gym and rooftop terrace. "The maintenance fee is quite low," adds Mr. Kholodov.
Local amenities include the subway, shops on Queen Street and recreational amenities at Moss Park. "The location is more and more in demand," says Mr. Kholodov.

Full text:   Inspired by the Modernist designs of the Harvard Five, John and Margaret Stephens decided in 1959 to bring sophisticated architecture to Lake Rosseau. The home is little changed fifty years later
1033 SEGWUN PLACE,
MINETT, ONT.
WHAT: A vintage four-bedroom cottage with 510 feet of shoreline on Royal Muskoka Island in Lake Rosseau. The 2,272-square-foot cottage is on the market for the first time since it was built in 1959.
ASKING PRICE: $2.695-million
TAXES: $11,434.83 (2009)
AGENT: Chestnut Park Real Estate Ltd. (Paul Crammond)
Royal Muskoka Island is a rather grand name for a collection of pleasant cottage properties on Lake Rosseau, but the name stands as a reminder of the island's storied past.
"There is a lot of history on the island," says Craig Stephens, who has been visiting the family cottage there all of his life. "There was a history there before I was born."
From the time its doors opened in 1901, the Royal Muskoka Hotel drew tycoons and socialites from their summer homes all around the lakes.
Built on Royal Muskoka Island by Muskoka Navigation Co., the hotel had its own golf course and formal dances on Saturday nights. But on May 18, 1952, the Royal Muskoka burned to the ground. After the fire, the landmark hotel was not rebuilt and the land was eventually divided into lots and sold.
Craig Stephens' parents, the late John and Margaret, bought one of those lots in 1957. Four other lots were purchased by Craig's uncles and his grandmother.
Soon the various family members had cottages under construction on the island, but John and Margaret struggled to find a plan that they liked.
Then, in 1958, Margaret Stephens picked up a copy of Better Homes and Gardens and decided that the house featured on the magazine's cover would make an ideal Muskoka cottage. The Stephens contracted with a local builder to build the cottage, following the plan in the magazine, in 1959.
"I think they were the last to build," Mr. Stephens said during a recent interview.
After his mother died in 2008, Mr. Stephens came across the magazine, which she had kept all of that time.
The house that so impressed Ms. Stephens was the home of renowned U.S. architect John Black Lee, who built the house for his own family home in New Canaan, Conn.
After World War II, a group of modernist architects known as the Harvard Five established New Canaan as a centre of modern architecture.
Philip Johnson, who was perhaps the most celebrated of the group, built his famous Glass House there.
Mr. Lee joined the firm of Harvard Five member Eliot Noyes in 1949 and then went on to establish his own practice in New Canaan. He designed several houses in New Canaan, including two for his own family.
The house that the Stephens family admired is known as Lee House 2 and still stands in New Canaan. The design received an Award of Merit from the American Institute of Architects.
In Better Homes and Gardens , writer Neil Kuehnl described the virtues of the house: "Every once in a while, we discover a house that offers a startling amount of useful space - far more than its size or cost suggests. Usually it has a simple plan and clean, uncluttered lines. Such a house recalls a basic, centuries-old building fact: that simplicity and well-organized space nearly always go hand in hand."
Mr. Kuehul went on to say: "This house is just a rectangle - with four corner bedrooms, two baths, and a large central area designed for family living. That's all ... no halls, no stairways, no extra ups, downs, or sideways about it."
The house, the article explains, combines post-and-beam construction to create openness in the main living area, with conventional construction used in the bedrooms. In the centre of the house, the roof is raised above clerestory windows.
Many of the hallmarks of New Canaan design, including kitchens that open into family rooms and sliding glass doors that create slide-away walls, are incorporated into the Muskoka cottage. Such elements have become standard features of residential design.
Meanwhile, home and cottage owners in North America have come to favour design elements - such as spa-style bathrooms - that the New Canaan folk didn't envisage.
That's a dilemma that has created tension in Connecticut and elsewhere as the preservationists try to protect significant architecture while new buyers renovate or raze the architectural legacy.
Mr. Crammond says some potential buyers of the Minett cottage have wondered about enlarging the bathrooms or expanding the cottage. Because of the dwelling's character, he believes it would be a great shame to tear it down and rebuild. Regulations would prevent any new building from being erected so close to the water, he adds.
The sunroom, he notes, is about 31 feet from the water.
"You couldn't do that now."
Mr. Stephens says his mother was delighted with the way the cottage turned out. The open living space was ideal for hosting parties and gatherings of the many cousins and aunts and uncles who congregated on the island.
The Stephens added to the original design with a screened porch facing the water. Then, in the 1970s, they had the porch enclosed with sliding glass doors to create a sunroom.
Mr. Crammond calls the kitchen "the world's largest galley kitchen".
Mr. Stephens says its openness allowed anyone preparing food to remain part of the social scene.
The four bedrooms each stand at a corner of the house, giving each bedroom a view in two directions.
Today the cottage looks much as it has for years.
Mr. Stephens says a strong adherence to tradition is built into the culture of Muskoka, where 100-year-old cottages still have the original furniture.
"There's not too much within the cottage that has changed," says Mr. Stephens. "But everything you see on the property has evolved over the years."
The family built an oversized boathouse, a detached garage and a boat port with sundeck above.
The point of land includes a sand beach area, deeper granite shore and gentle terrain.
Mr. Stephens says his parents deliberately left as many trees standing as possible and left the forest floor untouched.
"You could say that they were environmentalists in that they respect Muskoka for what it was and they taught us to respect it."
The younger Mr. Stephens moved permanently to Muskoka several years ago. He and his siblings have decided to sell the property because it no longer suits the expanding family.
Mr. Crammond says sales are picking up in Muskoka this year after a dismal 2008.
"The market was basically frozen last year."
Listings are up this year, he says, because some cottages that didn't sell last year are still available.
On Royal Muskoka, the Stephens recently cut the price by $300,000 to $2.695-million, Mr. Crammond says, "indicating that the family would like to sell this year, not 2010".

This war-era bungalow listed at $325,000 was a summertime rarity - a property affordable for first-time buyers, says agent Heather Lemieux.
That's likely the reason she got seven offers for the Scarborough residence on the first day.
"There's definitely a lack of inventory, especially in that price range," says Ms. Lemieux.
It also helped that the three-bedroom house was updated in areas like the eat-in kitchen and two full bathrooms.
"The house was very well maintained by the long-time owners," says Ms. Lemieux. "You could tell that [the neighbours] maintained their homes very well as well, so that definitely added to the curb appeal."
The combined living and dining room features crown mouldings and hardwood flooring that extends into the kitchen. There is a semi-circular breakfast bar with storage underneath. "It was quite unique," adds Ms. Lemieux.
Above-grade windows illuminate a secondary kitchen, workshop and fireside family room on the lower level, which can be entered from a separate side entrance. "You could very easily convert the basement into a basement apartment," Ms. Lemieux says.
Outside, there is a wide driveway to the carport and a private backyard with a garden shed and a large deck with some shade from a birch tree.
The surrounding area is a safe one with parks in every direction, as well as local schools, libraries and public transit, including the Scarborough RT and GO Train stations. "It's a quiet area," says Ms. Lemieux.

This detached, two-storey house has a rear addition that made it much larger than it appears, which is a big asset when the home is compared to other west-end properties nearby, says agent Nutan Brown.
"[The previous owners] took what was a typical Upper Bloor West Village home and expanded it to a size that would accommodate a family very nicely," she says.
The expansion allowed for a new lower level studio, a second floor master bedroom with an ensuite powder room and Juliet balcony and an extra space off the kitchen with a walkout to a deck.
"The main floor family room was a very huge attraction," Ms. Brown says. "Most homes do not have that kind of addition in the Bloor West Village area."
The wiring, plumbing, heating and cooling systems were also updated, the roof replaced and interior gutted and remodelled by another owner within the last decade.
Modern finishes within the 1940s house include hardwood floors and pot lights in the open living and dining area, stainless steel kitchen appliances and broadloom in the lower level recreation room.
The main bathroom services the three bedrooms upstairs.
Other assets include three-car parking accessed from a lane, a private back yard and a front garden with native plants and perennials. "It's a beautiful showpiece of colours," says Ms. Brown.
Local amenities include parks, schools and places of worship, as well as High Park and Bloor Street shops and subway further south.

Abstract: On the stress scale, buying a new home is up there with getting married or undergoing a serious medical procedure. This show follows real-estate agent Sandra Rinomato's efforts to put first-time buyers into the right home. In tonight's episode, Erin and Karl, a young couple still living with Erin's parents, want to buy a farm that's postcard-perfect. But there's more idealism than realism in their fantasies of country living. Rinomato sits them down to broker a compromise.

REALITY
Ghost Hunters
OLN, 7 p.m.
Ghost Hunters follows the ghost-busting exploits of Jason Hawes and Grant Wilson, two average guys who spend their days working as plumbers for Roto-Rooter. At times the series has drawn heat from parapsychologists scornful of the show's blue-collar methodology and tendency to sensationalize, but each episode is usually worth watching for the ghost story. Tonight's a good one: On Halloween, the ghost hunters check into Colorado's infamous Stanley Hotel, best known as the inspiration for Stephen King's novel The Shining . Their first stop is a guest room that sets their ghost-detecting gizmos spinning.
DRAMA
Southland
NBC, 8 p.m.If you missed Southland during its brief debut run last spring, take advantage of a second chance. The edgy police drama focuses sharply on cops working the beat in Los Angeles. The series was notable for marking the TV return of Ben McKenzie, formerly of The O.C ., who demonstrated strong acting chops as the rookie uniform cop Ben Sherman. In a rebroadcast of the pilot, the new kid is shocked at shortcuts taken by his training officer partner (Michael Cudlitz) and contemplates quitting the LAPD midway through his first shift. His fellow officers, meanwhile, investigate the disappearance of a young girl.
HUMOUR
Kenny vs. Spenny
Showcase, 9 p.m.
Kenny vs. Spenny features long-time friends Kenny Hotz and Spencer Rice competing in various juvenile challenges - to wit: who can smoke the most pot? - after which the loser is subjected to some form of humiliation. Tonight's double-shot presents two typically absurd contests: First, the boyos compete to see who can wear a dead octopus on his head the longest; the second show is a 10-mile road race - which might be an ordinary challenge except for Kenny tricking Spenny into believing his mother has died.
DOCUMENTARY
Life + Death in Kandahar
CBC Newsworld, 10 p.m.
First broadcast on the fifth estate , this report takes viewers inside the NATO trauma hospital in Kandahar province. Operated by Canadian medical volunteers, the unit is one of the busiest trauma hospitals in Afghanistan, treating hundreds of patients a day. The most gut-wrenching medical emergencies are those children severely injured by roadside bombs. A grim reminder of the casualties happening daily in Afghanistan.

SCIENCE
The Nature of Things
CBC, 7 p.m.
This program follows Albertan mechanical engineer Brian Fleck as he charts the progress of the car of the future. His quest takes him to the congested freeways of Los Angeles and later to Italy, where two green-minded students have co-founded the Vehicle Design Summit.
DRAMA
Law & Order:
Criminal Intent
NBC, 8 p.m.
Former West Wing regular Janel Moloney delivers a strong guest turn in this standout episode from last season. Moloney plays the long-suffering wife of a minister mired in a web of deception regarding the murder of a celebrity doctor. The NYPD detectives assigned to the case believe she's keeping quiet about her husband's activities, and make her the focus of their investigation.
SCI-FI
Tin Man
Space, 9 p.m.
First shown in 2007, this six-hour miniseries puts a bleak sci-fi spin on The Wizard of Oz . Zooey Deschanel plays D.G., a bored Kansas waitress transported via tornado to something called the "Outer Zone" (O.Z., get it?). Her new friends include the Tin Man (Neal McDonough) - a former cop imprisoned in a metal suit - and a scarecrow figure called Glitch (Alan Cumming) who has had half his brain surgically removed. Not dark enough? Hamilton native Kathleen Robertson is well cast as the horribly evil witch Azkadellia, who wants to plunge all of Oz into pitch-black darkness.
REALITY
Survivorman: Labrador
OLN, 10 p.m.
Hardy survivalist Les Stroud braves the unforgiving region of Labrador. By the end of the first day, he's seriously worried about hypothermia, and inclement weather is making it nearly impossible or him to follow the trail.
SUNDAY

REALITY
Ty's Great British
Adventure
ABC, 8 p.m.
Extreme Makeover: Home Edition host Ty Pennington crosses the pond in this special edition of the series. His destination is the seaside town of Portreath located in southwest England. What was once a bustling port and popular tourist destination has become a rundown mess, particularly the local park in the town centre. Previous plans to spruce up the park have fallen apart. Ty and his reno team arrive and immediately set up a revitalization plan. But townsfolk are put off by Ty's gung-ho approach - and there's no money in the town coffers for the project.
SCI-FI
Defying Gravity
ABC, CTV, 9 p.m.
New show alert: Defying Gravity is described in press materials as a "sexy, provocative space thriller set in the very near future"; similar wording was used to launch the original Star Trek back in 1969. The series follows eight astronauts from five nations onboard the starship Antares, which has embarked on a six-year mission. The crew includes a flight engineer, a geologist (Laura Harris) and ship commander (Malik Yoba). The story veers between the past, showing the ship's crew in training, and the present, as the ship hurtles toward Venus. In the opener, the Antares leaves Earth and there is immediate suspicion that the journey is being controlled by forces beyond mission control.
DOCUMENTARY
Marilyn: The Last Sessions
CBC Newsworld, 10 p.m.
This documentary is based on tapes recorded with the late actress during psychoanalysis sessions in the months before her death on Aug. 5, 1962. The tapes, which Monroe made with Freudian psychoanalyst Ralph Greenson, were destroyed years ago, but this program assembles her rambling thoughts from the doctor's "nearly verbatim" notes. The results are hardly surprising: Monroe is depicted as a desperately insecure soul, but the program is more interesting for the late star's perspective on writers Truman Capote, Arthur Miller and, yes, the Kennedys.

MUSIC
Sugarland: Live on
the Inside
ABC, 8 p.m.
The vocal duo of Jennifer Nettles and Kristian Bush burst onto the country scene in 2004 with the bestselling album Twice the Speed of Life and have since sold a staggering seven-million CDs (yep, country fans still buy CDs in the U.S.); they've also collected enough Grammys and Country Music Awards to fill a king-size pickup truck. Filmed at an arena in Lexington, Ky., this special is a greatest-hits affair that airs the night before the release of Sugarland's live concert CD.
DRAMA
Once a Thief
TVtropolis, 10 p.m.
Lasting one brief, not particularly memorable, season, this series is worth revisiting as a Canadian TV curiosity. Spun off from a popular TV movie, the series cast Sandrine Holt as Li Ann Tsei, a member of a ruthless Chinese crime family who fell in love with handsome thief Mac Ramsey (Ivan Sergei). Somehow the two end up in Canada working for an elite crime-fighting unit under the direction of Victor Mansfield (played by Nicholas Lea, ex of The X-Files ). The lightweight stories always played second fiddle to solid action sequences, which are in evidence as Mac is "adopted" by a gang of jewel thieves.
FOOD
Ultimate Cake-Off
TLC, 10 p.m.
Spinning off from the success of TLC's Cake Boss - currently the highest-rated food show on U.S. cable - this new cooking competition airs with a sneak peek tonight before starting its weekly run on Aug. 31. In each episode, three contestants meet a corporate client requiring a mammoth cake for a special event, which range from an aquarium's new shark exhibit to a July 4th celebration. The rules stipulate each cake must be at least 1 ½ metres tall and look magnificent. The contestants have nine hours to assemble their masterpieces and the winner takes away $10,000.
DOCUMENTARY
Captured on Film: The True Story of Marion Davies
TCM, 11:30 p.m.
One of Hollywood's most tainted legends receives a rightful homage. The star of both silent films and talkies, Marion Davies was a gifted actress with a flair for comedy. Away from the camera, she was famous for nearly four decades as the "kept woman" of publishing magnate William Randolph Hearst, who refused to leave his wife. (Their affair was largely brought to light by Orson Welles's 1941 film Citizen Kane , a not-so-thinly veiled look at Hearst's life that depicted Davies as a talentless shrew.) Narrated by Charlize Theron, the program includes clips from Davies's most celebrated films and shows her uncanny skill at impersonation.

DOCUMENTARY
Road to Baleya
Bravo!, 7 p.m.
Cliché as it sounds, the language of music really does transcend boundaries and cultures. This documentary details the enduring friendship between Malian musician Mansa Sissoko and a quartet of Canadian musicians who travel to Mansa's home village of Baleya for recording sessions, which are orchestrated by Canuck Lewis Melville. Post-recording, the group of friends journeys to some remote villages in Mali's hill country, where malaria has taken a deadly toll in recent years. A remarkable, touching film.
DOCUMENTARY
Korea: The Unfinished War
TVO, 8 p.m.
Done by renowned filmmaker Brian McKenna, this four-part series rewinds what is still referred to "the forgotten war." Although the focus is the first major military conflict in the atomic-bomb era was actually shot in North Korea - a rare occurrence - and talks to American and Canadians who fought side by side, and to former Korean soldiers who faced them. Tonight's chapter reopens the long-standing allegations that U.S. forces made quiet use of bio-warfare weapons.

1,000 Ways to Die
Spike, 9 p.m.
How on earth does Spike keep coming up with these shows? Skewing to the cable channel's way-manly demographic, this series recreates bizarre deaths normally restricted to the back pages of small-town newspapers. In tonight's show: A construction worker is buried alive in gravel; an amateur entomologist dies from a black-widow bite; and one poor soul tumbles to death in an industrial dryer. The show tries to attach some degree of decency by including interviews with scientists and safety experts, but the more likely thing that keeps people watching is that most common of human reactions: At least it wasn't me.
TRAVEL
Stephen Fry in America
TVO, 10 p.m.
British actor and TV presenter Stephen Fry is a delight in this rambling, six-part travelogue. Travelling primarily by London cab across the U.S., Fry covers all 50 states in the series, and his boyish enthusiasm for all-things American never wavers; his interaction with a handful of New Jersey mob-wannabes is among many highlights. In tonight's show, Fry spends time in Maine with several seasoned fishermen, one of whom teaches him how to hypnotize a lobster before cooking it. Ain't that America?

BIOGRAPHY
The Achievers: Bette Davis
Bravo!, 7 p.m.
This profile explores the life of Bette Davis in rich detail, and points out a little-known fact: Although Davis was a Broadway star, her transition to film was far from easy. Her earliest films for Universal were flops; her movie career came later, when Warner Bros. wisely teamed her up with James Cagney and other rising stars. The film touches on Davis's storied personal life - once widowed and thrice-divorced, she raised her children as a single mother - and includes clips from her most beloved films, including All About Eve and Whatever Happened to Baby Jane ? She was one of a kind.
RETRO
TV's 50 Funniest Phrases
NBC, 8 p.m.
Hosted by 30 Rock 's Jane Krakowski, this special counts down TV's top catchphrases from the past half-century. The most obvious phrases surfaced in the top 10 - including "Yada yada yada" from Seinfeld ; "D'oh!" from The Simpsons ; and "How you doin'?" from Friends - but the blogosphere heated up the day after it was first aired with people noting some of the more glaring omissions: "Dy-no-mite" from Good Times , and "Whatchoo talkin' about, Willis?" from Diff'rent Strokes . Neither can be considered a classic, but a mention would have been nice. And ranking "It's going to be legendary" from How I Met Your Mother in 10th place added insult to injury. Classic-TV fans are so sensitive.
NATURE
Day of the Shark 2
Discovery, 8 p.m.
This sequel to the Discovery Channel special Day of the Shark follows more foolhardy types who still believe a lightweight aluminum frame is the smartest way to get up close to the deadly ocean creatures. As in the first special, it's most entertaining when their best guesses are proved wrong. Among the harrowing moments: A great white breaks through a shark cage, trapping two divers inside; a shark attacks a former Navy Seal in Florida; and a bull shark terrorizes a spear-fishing party in the Bahamas. Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water.

This show follows real-estate agent Sandra Rinomato's efforts to put first-time buyers into the right home. In tonight's episode, Erin and Karl, a young couple still living with Erin's parents, want to buy a farm that's postcard-perfect. But there's more idealism than realism in their fantasies of country living. Rinomato sits them down to broker a compromise.

Have you been taken in by The Seven Sins of the Marketplace ? In this special edition of the series, host Erica Johnson relates the seven sins - Addition, Omission, Creation, Salvation, Assurance, Persuasion and Deception - and shows consumers how they can steer clear of such sneaky tricks. It's not wise, for example, to listen to the sales pitch of natural-gas suppliers who offer locked-in rates that promise to knock thousands off your annual energy bill. It never works out that way, of course, but a sucker is born every minute.

TV insiders say 30 Rock will again sweep the best-comedy categories at September's Emmys, and why wouldn't it? Try to think of a funnier woman on TV today than Tina Fey, or a more complicated sitcom figure than Alec Baldwin as a vainglorious network exec. Tonight has two grand shows from last season. The first guest-stars Carrie Fisher as Liz's writer idol, who is a complete bust on The Girly Show . In the second, Jack is forced to hand out pink slips, which he's briskly efficient at.

Each episode in the 10-part series is split between the women working the mean streets and at home with the family.

But forensics experts can't pinpoint where the shooting took place. Through dogged police work, they discover the man is associated with dodgy criminal types, but there appears to be no motive. As the detectives peel away the layers of the victim's life, they discover the shocking truth.

Full text: Long saddled with an aristocratic reputation that hurt her electoral prospects, Parti Quebecois Leader Pauline Marois has put her controversial Montreal stone mansion up for sale, asking $8-million.
The 41-acre estate in the leafy community of Île-Bizard had been a target of mockery by comedians who liked to depict Ms. Marois as a chatelaine out of touch with regular people.
Though she hails from modest origins, Ms. Marois's patrician manners and marriage to financier Claude Blanchet became such liabilities that, during a by-election campaign in 2007, she invited a television crew to her cottage to show how frugally she lived.
The ploy backfired because it drew more attention to the Île-Bizard house, which the couple calls La Closerie, a quaint French expression for a small, enclosed property.
The couple is embroiled in a libel suit against The Gazette for an article that raised questions about how the couple obtained a zoning exemption that enabled them to build the mansion on land reserved for farming.
The house is "a true oasis," according to the real-estate listing for the seven-bathroom, 12,000-square-foot building, which comes with a Jacuzzi and heated pool.
"This very elegant French villa style property is located on an immense riverfront estate. The remarkable copper roof, the local fieldstone siding and the abundant fenestration give this house a very particular charm."
Ms. Marois is selling her house because she wants to move to her electoral riding of Charlevoix to be closer to her constituents, since her children have grown and left the house, spokesman Pascal Monette said.

Full text: Proposed development raises ire of environmentalists and local snowmobilers, but others say new source of jobs would be welcome
An unlikely umbrella organization of 42 businesses and groups, binding together snowmobilers and dirt bikers with environmentalists, store owners and fishing enthusiasts, has been set up in opposition to a proposed four-season resort development just north of Squamish, B.C.
On the other side are the supporters of the Garibaldi at Squamish resort plan, including the local chamber of commerce, real estate developers and construction firms who say that without it, the town of 15,000 will turn into a commuter satellite of Vancouver.
Brohm Ridge, the proposed location of the resort, juts out like a shoulder from Mount Garibaldi, the spectacular peak north of Squamish. Wildflowers and clear creeks dominate the proposed village site, 1,100 metres up the mountain.
The ridge has million-dollar views of surrounding ranges and glaciers, with the long fjord of Howe Sound stretching into the distant Pacific toward Vancouver, 65 kilometres to the south.
The 3,238-hectare proposal includes a 25-lift ski hill, two golf courses, development near two popular lakes and the construction of about 5,500 condominiums, a hotel and housing units. With a capacity of 22,500 beds, it will more than double the current population of Squamish, but be a third the size of the resort at Whistler, another 50 kilometres north.
Around 70 protesters turned up at a recent Squamish district council meeting to treat assembled TV cameras to signs with slogans such as "Don't pass G@S," and calling the resort proposal a "land grab."
Kimberley Martin, owner of the Funky Monkey Boutique, has been selling T-shirts in support of the protests. She said the issue of business being taken away from the centre of town to an outlying resort area is secondary to her concerns about environmental impacts.
"I don't believe [the resort] is sustainable or viable. I feel there should be more energy or effort in developing already used sites rather than pristine wilderness," she said.
A snowboarder for 19 years, Ms. Martin said turning an area already used by outdoor enthusiasts into a formal resort smacked of elitism. She also believes it would negatively affect fish-rich streams in its search for water to sustain 15,000 skiers a day or maintain golf courses.
Darren McCartney of the Squamish chamber of commerce disagreed, saying the chamber accepted the resort plan "conditionally" so long as sensible environmental planning was in place along with community involvement in how the project evolves.
"With the expansion of the Sea to Sky highway [for the 2010 Winter Olympics] we're in the path of urban sprawl. Thinking that we will not change is unrealistic," he said. "The flavour I've had from the community is that we've been trying to replace a loss in commercial-tax revenue because of industries leaving."
Supporters of the resort say it would revive the former blue-collar town after a decade of watching traditional forestry industries leave.
Brent di Mazzo, owner of Hard Rock Construction, said he supported the resort because the community lost major employers such as Interfor, Woodfibre's pulp mill and BC Rail. And while 1,700 opponents signed a petition against the resort, he said, many more support it, though less vocally.
"The town is dying and turning into a bedroom community. We need a good, clean industry, which is what I think [Garibaldi at Squamish] is trying to be."
Mr. di Mazzo said the district has lost millions in tax revenue.
"I think we need the tax base. There are weeds growing in the cracks in the sidewalk and no money to patch the roads," he said.
And then there are the jobs, which he said were badly needed.
"I'm in construction and there is at least a 10-year build. I may benefit from this or I may not, but I've got three boys and I know they need jobs in the long term."
Mr. di Mazzo thinks a referendum on the subject would provide the best indication of local support or antipathy.
Squamish Mayor Greg Gardner is not entertaining a referendum at this stage, but has been studying a fiscal-impact study commissioned by the district on the resort's potential.
"I'm impressed with the quality of debate so far ... It's a large issue and there would be positive and negative impacts. The province is proceeding with [the assessment process], and their stated reason is to encourage economic activity through tourism, but we still have a lot of unanswered questions," he said.
B.C.'s Environmental Assessment Office will submit its report on the environmental viability of the project to the provincial government in early August, and a response from the ministry is expected around mid-September.

Full text: When the global recession hit China, Beijing ordered the country's banks to lend. And lend they did.
Now the drive to stimulate its domestic economy through easy monetary policy and aggressive banking has triggered dangerous unintended consequences, including a new wave of troubled loans and bubbles in the stock and property markets that threaten to blow up in Beijing's face.
If unchecked, China's vaunted recovery from the global slowdown will be in serious jeopardy.
So far, the credit bubble is producing a contradictory response from a government more worried about unleashing social unrest than about the potential damage to its economy or financial system from bad lending practices, analysts say.
The government "somewhat wants to rein in some of this lending," but has few regulatory tools at its disposal, said Jennifer Richmond, senior China analyst with Stratfor, a global intelligence firm based in Austin, Tex.
Beijing is also likely to maintain the lending spree at least until Oct. 1 - the 60th anniversary of the Communist regime and an important symbolic date - because the government fears triggering a wave of factory closings and subsequent widespread unrest if the money dries up.
New government measures announced yesterday include tighter controls on large bank loans exceeding five million yuan (about $790,000), closer supervision and a requirement that "fixed-asset investment loans" be doled out in ways that benefit the real economy. And in a belated move to soak up excess money and slow the flood of credit, the People's Bank of China has ordered certain overly aggressive commercial lenders to purchase 100 billion yuan worth of short-term bonds. The banks have until mid-September to pay for them.
"They have to do it through these policy measures of pushing bonds onto the banks, because they're not enforcing any new risk evaluation," said Ms. Richmond, who closely monitors China's bank practices. "They can't afford to, because ultimately they're going to want to use the banks again to lend like they've been doing in the first half of the year."
Loan growth exploded in the first six months, totalling a record 7.4 trillion yuan. That's nearly a quarter of China's gross domestic product and well in excess of the government's own projected quota of five trillion yuan for the entire year.
There is little doubt much of this cash has found its way into booming urban property markets and red-hot equities. The Chinese stock market has soared 88 per cent so far this year. Yesterday, when Sichuan Expressway Co. became the first new listing on the Shanghai Stock Exchange's main board in almost a year, trading was so frenzied that officials had to twice call halts.
In Beijing, house prices soared an average of 27 per cent in the first six months of the year, and Hong Kong property loans are at their highest level on record.
Analysts estimate that at least a third of all new bank lending is being funnelled into stocks or real estate speculation. Another third is going just to keep struggling businesses running day to day in a tough economy, rather than for infrastructure or other economic improvements.
Many of the loans at the local level are motivated by politics, rather than economics, say analysts, who fear another flood of bad loans will emerge from shoddy or corrupt bank practices. The chief government watchdog has promised stricter regulation, but analysts say it has little ammunition to rein in practices the government itself has encouraged.
"Many financial institutions pursue business growth, but are weak in risk management; highlight prelending examination but neglect after-loan supervision; or stop loan management at superficial levels," the China Banking Regulatory Commission said yesterday. The regulator is urging banks to earmark parts of large fixed-asset loans to, for example, the companies making or selling equipment and materials for projects, rather than turning over the whole sum to the borrower.
Most of China's impressive first-half growth of 7.1 per cent, annualized, stems from investment. This is not a recipe for a strong economic recovery of the sort that China boosters believe will lead the world out of a prolonged slump.
"The government is trying to stimulate the heck out of the economy by forcing banks to lend. And then they tell them to do it responsibly. You can't really do it responsibly, because it's not driven by normal demand," said Vitaliy Katsenelson, director of research with Investment Management Associates in Denver and a long-time critic of China's growth strategy.
"They're putting on the brakes while pushing on the gas at the same time. And you can't do that."

Full text: Design for portable restaurant has venture capitalists salivating around the world
Although it doesn't have any big guns or transform into a tank, if you mistook this cherry-red maritime shipping crate in Montreal's Old Port for a futuristic robot you wouldn't be far off.
Powered by two rooftop solar panels, in only 90 seconds every morning this slickly decorated steel box unfolds its walls and two shady awnings to create a 28-seat terrace. Then it's up and running: a largely self-sustaining, portable gourmet seafood restaurant.
It's called Müvbox, and since launching in early June it's rocketed around the globe via design blogs and websites. The response has bowled over its creator, Daniel Noiseux, founder of Montreal's Pizzaiolle restaurant chain.
"I'm trying hard to keep my head," he says. "Venture capitalists from Geneva called three times this week, and we've had interest from Greece, Asia, and one e-mail from Russia simply said, 'I want 100 units, how much!?' "
The buzz, Mr. Noiseux suspects, is because his creation marks combined evolutions in street food, portable real estate and sustainable design.
Although similar in size to a chip wagon, every day Müvbox's fully enclosed kitchen offers up local Quebecois delicacies such as Iles de la Madeleine lobster, clam chowder and foie gras.
But Müvbox is essentially a prototype. Mr. Noiseux's intention is to sell units customized to the needs of entrepreneurs and businesses, be it a mobile restaurant, retail or demo space. "Say, if a local chef wanted to run a mini-restaurant close to Toronto Film Festival events," he says.
A base unit costs $150,000 and has mechanized walls, flooring made from recycled tires, ecologically friendly lighting and solar panels. Then it's ready to be tricked out by Mr. Noiseux's crack team of designers and architects.
To create Müvbox, Mr. Noiseux approached Montreal design studio Sid Lee, which worked on branding, market research and the company website, then brought in architects from Ædifica who came up with solutions for folding walls and sourced environmentally conscious materials. It took 18 months of collaboration, but now Mr. Noiseux says one unit can be built in six to eight weeks.
Each shipping container is recycled from one of more than 700,000 discarded annually in North America.
Sustainable design is a large part of Müvbox's mission. "The base unit is 100 per cent self-sufficient," Mr. Noiseux says, "but I aim to take every finished unit off the grid in the next five years." Right now solar panels provide almost 40 per cent of Müvbox's energy, and customers can choose from among many cost-saving green options, he says.
Connected to this idea of self-sufficiency is the fact that "a container is all about mobility," Mr. Noiseux explains. Müvbox can be operated for a season, then packed up and stored without a trace. But how receptive will cities be to these steel boxes dotting the urban landscape?
In Montreal you won't find a single chip truck or hot dog stand because of a near total ban on street food dating from the 1960s. Müvbox has sidestepped these rules since the quays of the Old Port are managed federally.
What the city does allow, however, is for vendors to set up during such events as Jazz Fest or Just For Laughs. "Müvbox answers a question nobody asked," Mr. Noiseux says, "and opens the way for the city to reconsider the rules."
If it's a question of hygiene this gourmet restaurant exceeds expectations. Its kitchen offers meals made with fresh local ingredients, from its lobster right down to its cheese and ice cream.
Since Toronto's new street-food program brought ethnic treats to its sidewalks this summer, Mr. Noiseux has had his eye on the paved plaza of the Sugar Beach project near the foot of Jarvis Street. A new urban space like this would be the perfect place to set up shop, he says.
For now, Mr. Noiseux is closing a deal on the first three units, which he's glad will remain close to home in Quebec City and Montreal.
This fall he plans to take the demo unit on the road to trade shows in Chicago and Cologne.
"In the short term we're set on growing locally," he says, "but this box was meant to go around the world."

Full text: While few see a profitable future for newspapers, David Black's belief in the business is unshaken - witness the publisher's newest attraction: beaten-down big city dailies. David Ebner reports
David Black has a boat named Esperanza - "hope," in Spanish. Many would say the name would be better suited for his business strategy, one pinned firmly on the future of newspapers.
He loves details, isn't flashy and likes a good yarn, much like the 158 publications put out by Black Press Ltd., a motley collection of generally small papers mostly in British Columbia and Washington state. He runs them lean - and they make money.
About a year ago, the ever-ambitious Mr. Black (no relation to the one-time media baron now jailed in Florida) was on the expansion hunt. And so was Platinum Equity LLC, a conglomerate out of Los Angeles, a specialist in rejuvenating businesses that have hit hard times and owner of everything from telecommunications to fibreglass and crane rentals.
In March, with Mr. Black on board as an investor and adviser, Platinum Equity bought The San Diego Union-Tribune, a 141-year-old paper where advertising revenue had fallen 40 per cent in the past three years as the California city was ravaged by the burst real estate bubble and by recession.
It is here David Black sees a future for newspapers. He believes in an old-fashioned recipe, that a local paper has a unique role for advertisers, especially the likes of furniture stores and auto dealers. There is value in a full-page ad, even for beaten-down city papers. When the economy comes back, papers will get back on their feet too, the idea goes.
Mr. Black and Platinum don't have dreams of editorial expansion. Mr. Black's papers are mostly the no-frill variety, and there are no plans to resurrect the Union-Tribune's Washington bureau, which was shuttered last year. "In a perfect world, you have bureaus in several places but that perfect world isn't going to happen, I don't believe, where you have money to burn in editorial," Mr. Black said in an interview.
The 63-year-old isn't so much a newspaper man as a businessman running newspapers. Making money is the challenge he relishes, and he continues to make it when many others in the industry are failing. Born in Vancouver, educated in engineering at University of British Columbia and business at University of Western Ontario, Mr. Black bought his first newspaper in 1975 when he was 29, the tiny Williams Lake Tribune in the central interior of British Columbia.
More than three decades later, from his headquarters in Victoria, Mr. Black watches the industry suffer. Losses pile up at print publications and no one makes money online - or has a good idea where a profit will eventually come from, because everything is given away free and advertising revenue doesn't support it. Big-name papers are failing in the United States and bleeding in Canada.
Now, with bondholders in charge of CanWest Global Communications Corp., a re-ordering of this country's media landscape looms as some analysts predict the media giant will sell its 13 dailies and 26 community newspapers.
Mr. Black could be a key player.
Black Press is projected to be profitable this year - annual revenue of about $500-million and 2.8 million in circulation - and he often further bolsters his position through partnerships.
Earlier this decade, he sold 19.4 per cent of Black Press to Torstar Corp. to expand his company. In 2006, he worked with Onex Corp. on what turned out to be a failed attempt to buy two Philadelphia dailies (Mr. Black demanded cuts the union didn't want; those papers this year went into bankruptcy protection).
And, this year, working as an individual, rather than through Black Press, he's in San Diego with Platinum.
Few see a profitable future for newspapers. The Union-Tribune sat for sale for almost a year as other papers, like the 146-year-old Seattle Post-Intelligencer, went out of business. Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway Inc. owns a stake in Washington Post Co., said in May he would not pay any price for most papers and forecast the possibility of "unending losses."
Mr. Black's belief in the business is unshaken. This is a business cycle, severe, but not a whole new world, he said, particularly for community/suburban papers and small-town publications that make up Black Press, businesses that are better insulated from digital media. As for large urban dailies, he believes their costs are too high, given that websites such as Craigslist.com have gutted classified ad revenues.
"The Internet no doubt has had an effect, and will have an effect, for community papers, but I don't think it's an enormous effect," Mr. Black said. "Community newspapers are still the best place for retailers to advertise. They get the most response for their dollars.
"For the big metros, it's different. They were living off their classifieds. They have to reinvent themselves."
Louis Samson, Platinum's principal on the San Diego deal, was introduced to Mr. Black through an investment banker. Mr. Samson and Platinum had been looking for the right newspaperman to work with. The connection with Mr. Black was immediate, and strong.
Mr. Samson admired Mr. Black's business acumen and his record at Black Press, where budgets are kept tight and products are straightforward. There are not overly ambitious, they do what they do well, which generally is local news in a small community or suburb.
"David looks at problems differently, always thinking about the next move," says Mr. Samson. "From a business standpoint, he's willing to think about how to reorganize things."
In newspapers these days, reorganize means cuts: wage cuts, staff cuts, pension cuts. It is what Mr. Black did in Akron, Ohio, where Black Press bought the well-regarded Beacon Journal in 2006 for $165-million (U.S.). The editorial staff was slashed by a quarter - 40 out of 161 - after the deal closed.
Though Mr. Black said the paper is still making money, Black Press has had to take a $100-million writedown on the investment, which pushed partner Torstar to reduce the value of its stake in Black Press to a glaring zero.
Mr. Black and Mr. Samson are realists. They see the commoditization of information. They know profit margins will be lower than in the past. "You have to make it profitable and put it in a position to thrive," Mr. Samson said.
For Mr. Black, a father of four, with three grandchildren, this push toward big-name newspapers might have never happened. He might have been half-retired, sailing and golfing, but in 2005, personal tragedy struck. His wife, Annabeth, who worked closely with her husband in the running of Black Press, was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. A year later, she was dead and Mr. Black's parents also died around the same time.
"I threw myself in the business," Mr. Black recalled. "I didn't know what else to do."
He made the Akron deal and then in 2007 battled Quebecor Inc. for Osprey Media Income Fund's 54 papers in Ontario but ceded the deal when partner Torstar balked at raising the bid.
"David's got a great nose for making money and he's fearless doing it," said friend Robert Prichard, a former chief executive officer of Torstar and Toronto Star publisher who himself was battered by the business during his time at the helm.
"He's always pushed himself to go further, and farther. He's never afraid of a fight, and fights to win."
The Platinum connection could foreshadow what happens in the Canadian media business. Banks aren't keen to lend money to buy newspapers, so it is private equity money that analysts believe will be a force in the shakeout of the industry. Platinum, run by 44-year-old billionaire Tom Gores, one of the youngest on the Forbes rich list, owns about two dozen businesses, with estimated total revenue of $13.5-billion. Platinum's latest push is to buy part of Delphi Corp., the bankrupt auto-parts maker.
Mr. Samson said Platinum has looked at most newspaper assets that have come up for sale and wouldn't limit its hunt to the United States.
Unlike earlier, flamboyant Canadian media barons - including Izzy Asper, the patriarch who built CanWest and died in 2003, or the aristocratic Conrad Black - David Black is a shy, smart college-professor type. He speaks softly, is content to keep a low profile, likes the quiet on the water when sailing.
In business, he hits hard when there's an opening. And a bunch of openings could emerge shortly.
While Mr. Black does see better prospects at smaller papers, he is interested in larger ones, too. "I'm fairly agnostic [about size]," he says.
"Where there are opportunities, there are opportunities."

Full text: The food, wine and cheese are getting even better - and now, a prominent guidebook is directing crowds of oenophiles to the region
Even whipping wind and ominous clouds threatening to burst didn't keep eager visitors away from Prince Edward County winery tasting rooms on a recent Saturday. At Waupoos Winery, Huff Estates and the County Cider Company, staff juggled an onslaught of visitors impervious to the weather and eager to test County wares.
Prince Edward County, with its mix of family-owned wineries, creative chefs and chic art galleries, is officially on the hit list of weekenders from Toronto to Montreal: With the inclusion of 13 of its wineries in Andrew Brooks's definitive wine-tour guide, Crush on Niagara , the rustic island will no longer be known only for its beaches and fertile farmland. Yet, with its dreamy landscape and laid-back vibe, the County can't help but pay homage to its rural roots, making it a perfect place to escape the city in style.
Wedged in the "golden triangle," within two to three hours' drive from Toronto, Montreal and Ottawa, Prince Edward County has an enviable position. Blink, however, and you may miss it. "I drove that stretch of the 401 from Toronto to Quebec countless times and never realized that along the way there was a bridge leading to another world," says Henriette Labelle-Campbell, events manager at The Waring House Inn in Picton.
Two decades ago, Labelle-Campbell and her husband crossed that bridge and invested in a summer home. Eventually they decided to make a permanent move, and they haven't looked back. "When we settled in the County in 1998, it was a rural community with very few amenities for tourists. If you hadn't eaten dinner at a local diner by 8 p.m., then you were out of luck."
These days, there is very little chance of going hungry after dark. The Waring House is home to Amelia's Garden, a fine-dining restaurant that is a favourite with locals. Executive chef Luis de Sousa's five-course tasting menu features seasonal dishes that are paired with locally produced wines. (A timely offering right now: Baby Blue pie made with in-season local blueberries and rhubarb and an oatmeal-cinnamon streusel topping.)
The Waring House is one of more than 20 designated stops on the Taste Trail, a self-guided route that links some of Prince Edward County's finest restaurants, artisanal food producers and wineries. Consider it a delectable connect-the-dots game that introduces visitors to the island's epicureans.
One path leads from Picton eastward along County Road 8. The scenery shifts between undulating fields rich with apple orchards and pristine vineyards on one side to stunning inlets on the other. There's no clutter in sight, and the crisp breeze over the water adds an air of calm.
A sign points to the Fifth Town Artisan Cheese Company, an environmentally responsible producer of cheese made with fresh, local goat and sheep milk. Owner Petra Cooper, co-founder of the Ontario Cheese Society, is considered a visionary. Fifth Town's production facility is the first in North America to earn the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) platinum designation, and it won the 2009 Ontario Premier's Award for Agri-Food Innovation Excellence.
Since opening two years ago, Fifth Town has revived the tradition of cheese-making in the County and Cooper has single-handedly taken charge. "It's all about the chemistry," she says. "I'm in the caves every day checking the cheese to make sure that everything is just right." Her formula seems to be working. Cape Vessey, Fifth Town's first hard cheese, won Grand Champion Goat Cheese at the 2008 Royal Winter Fair.
Cooper is not the only County up-and-comer. Torontonian Mark Bartkiw, a photographer by profession, has unveiled an organically grown pick-your-own vegetable, fruit and flower farm in Big Island. "My wife and I had always fantasized about living in the country, but we didn't intend to farm when we moved here three years ago," Bartkiw says. "After living here for a year, I was so inspired by the land."
In addition to the pick-your-own product, Bartkiw has a market stand that has become a daily stop for residents and day trippers. Community kinship is a cornerstone in Prince Edward County. "There is a great deal of collaboration between businesses here. People really work together to help deliver an outstanding experience to visitors," says Karin Potters, owner of Pinch Gourmet, a shop that sells everything from locally produced sausage to organic smoked salmon to hand-baked oat biscuits. Potters's husband, Michael, is owner and head chef at Harvest restaurant. Of the many wines featured on the Harvest menu, locally grown labels are in abundance, including those by Frederic Picard of Huff Estates.
According to Picard, size and geography bind the County and set it apart. "Niagara has 25 years of growing experience and more than a hundred wineries," he says. "We're a young region and the newest Designated Viticulture Area in Ontario." More established County estates such as Closson Chase Vineyards, founded in the late 1990s by esteemed viticulturist Deborah Paskus (a pioneer of the new County terroir), have been joined by the award-winning vintages of Huff, Waupoos and Norman Hardie Winery. One of the latest estates to make its mark is Redtail Vineyard, Canada's first off-grid winery, which produces up to 700 cases a year.
And it's not just food and wine producers who are chipping in. Prince Edward County's arts scene is also emerging. Its jazz festival is expanding, it has a vibrant theatre program, and the Arts Trail - a route of more than 20 artists and galleries around the island - is gaining exposure. Visitors can stop in at a variety of exhibition spaces, from Mad Dog Gallery, in a renovated timber-framed barn, to the new Oeno Gallery, housed in a contemporary light-filled space on the grounds of Huff Estates.
Oeno co-owner Carlyn Moulton moved to the County in 2004. Like other big-city transplants, she can't imagine living anywhere else. "It's a real place," she says, "not just one fabricated for tourists."

Full text: When Frank Hague died, more than 50 years ago, the long-time mayor of Jersey City left behind an estate valued at $10-million (U.S.). Although his salary never topped a few thousand dollars a year, he managed to accumulate most of this fortune while in office - quite literally.
Mr. Hague sat behind an antique "partners" desk, which he custom-fitted with a drawer that could be extended outward, into the laps of his visitors.
Those who had come seeking favours would place an envelope of cash in the tray, and then push it back.
In other states, Mr. Hague would be reduced to a historical footnote by now, the relic of a bygone era in which political strongmen were allowed to flourish. In New Jersey, however, he continues to serve as a role model, the spiritual godfather to a mind-boggling parade of elected officials who have been tarred by scandal.
On Thursday, police arrested three state mayors as part of a wide-ranging investigation into money-laundering and corruption. In total, 44 people - including five rabbis - were charged with an assortment of crimes, from accepting bribes to harvesting organs.
Even by the sordid standards of New Jersey, where sleazy dealings have become so commonplace that even the governor publicly jokes about them, this week's FBI crackdown left people slack-jawed.
"New Jersey's corruption problem is one of the worst, if not the worst, in the nation," Ed Kahrer, who is in charge of the FBI's white collar investigative unit, said following the arrests. "Corruption is a cancer that is destroying the core values of this state."
Popular culture, from television series like The Sopranos to films like On The Waterfront , has long fetishized New Jersey as a playground for furtive kickbacks, shady politicians, and mobsters of all stripes.
The question is: Why here? Why does New Jersey, more than any other state, seem to have cornered the market on corrupt officials?
"I think there is a culture in the state which, if it does not promote corruption, certainly tolerates it," said Bob Ingle, a veteran reporter and co-author of The Sopranos State , a book that chronicles New Jersey's seamy political past. "In Indiana, if you hold two public jobs it's a felony. In New Jersey if you hold two public jobs, you're a slacker."
Tolerance is an understatement. Billy Musto, a former mayor of Union City, was re-elected in 1982, just one day after he was jailed for racketeering.
Over the past eight years alone, more than 130 New Jersey officials have been charged with crimes.
The structure of politics in New Jersey makes it unusually susceptible to these kinds of problems. There is a tradition here of incredibly powerful municipal governments - there are 566 self-governing communities in the state - and incredibly weak state governments. And despite the corruption, many citizens are reluctant to change the system and consolidate political power at the regional or state level.
"Mayors have a lot of power, and because of this, all of the development rules and planning has to be done at the local level," said Ingrid Reed, a professor at Rutgers University.
"And many local governments are so small that they don't have professional staff."
The indictments handed down by the FBI on Thursday could have been lifted from an episode of The Sopranos .
Two years ago, police nabbed a real estate developer named Solomon Dwek for allegedly attempting to pass a fake cheque for $25-million. Mr. Dwek agreed to become an informant, and then, wearing a wire, offered bribes to dozens of elected officials, including the mayors of Hoboken and Seacaucus.
At the same time, Mr. Dwek asked several prominent members of a local Syrian Jewish community, including five rabbis, to help him launder his money so that he could conceal his assets. In a grisly sidebar, Mr. Dwek asked one man, Levy-Izhak Rosenbaum, a suspected organ peddler, if he could help him procure a kidney. Mr. Rosenbaum allegedly told him he had been harvesting and selling organs for years.
Even Mr. Ingle, a student of New Jersey corruption, was stunned by the indictments.
"Body parts selling is rare, even for New Jersey," he conceded. "I'm used to seeing police bring [arrested politicians] in in one bus. But this was three buses."

Full text: Peter Trueman used to read the evening news. Now, bird watching headlines a tranquil retirement on Amherst Island
So often on a Friday afternoon, Peter Trueman reminisces, he seemed to be dashing out of the studios at Global TV in order to get to the dock at Millhaven, Ont. From there, he would catch the ferry to Amherst Island.
"I would get on the boat and just feel the cares of the world sliding off my shoulders."
It wasn't long before the prominent news anchor decided that he preferred the serenity of Amherst to the broadcast studio.
In 1988, Mr. Trueman gave up his high-profile career in television to move full-time to the island with his wife, Eleanor Trueman.
At the time, Mr. Trueman was well-known across Canada as anchor for 15 years of the Ottawa-based World Report newscast. Before that, he worked for the Montreal Star and Toronto Star and Canadian Broadcasting Corp. during a career that saw the family re-locate 17 times.
Now, after more than 20 years in one place, the Truemans are ready to downsize and settle in the nearby town of Kingston, Ont. for a time.
Their house is currently co-listed for sale with Carolyn McIntire Smyth of Royal LePage Real Estate Services Ltd., Johnston and Daniel Division and Dave and Diane Hieatt of Royal LePage ProAlliance Realty. The asking price is $589,000.
The Truemans discovered Amherst Island while on a journey by boat down the Rideau River en route to the United States. They harboured in Stella Bay and took time to explore the island, which measures about 20 kilometres long and 5 kilometres wide, with Lake Ontario to the south and the north channel of the Bay of Quinte to the north.
The Truemans were immediately captivated by the bucolic farmland, stony beaches, and the tiny hamlet of Stella, which seemed virtually unchanged since the 1930s.
"We loved the ambience."
The couple purchased five acres of land on the south shore with 435 feet of shoreline on Lake Ontario.
"What we were both looking for was that water horizon - the hard, blue line of that horizon," Mr. Trueman said during a recent tour of the property, gesturing out towards the lake.
The couple chose plans for a house modelled after the historic two-storey inns that were once common in the area. An upstairs balcony and lower porch extend along the front façade.
"We wanted something that looked like it belonged here," says Mr. Trueman. He describes the style of the house as "the kind of thing that lined the St. Lawrence all the way to the sea in the late 1700s and early 1800s."
The custom-built house has four bedrooms and three bathrooms. A large living room has windows looking out on three sides.
The kitchen has views across the water towards smaller Nut Island.
"Doing the dishes is not really a trial," says Ms. Trueman.
The dining room overlooks green lawns and farmer's fields. The couple's three children and 11 grandchildren often gather there.
Upstairs, a bedroom and sitting room were designed as a separate suite. Today Mr. Trueman uses the sitting room as his office.
A cherry tree outside the window is laden with fruit.
"It had 7 cherries on it the first year," says Ms. Trueman. "It has certainly made up for it since."
The Truemans spend much of their time outdoors. Ms. Trueman paints watercolours and Mr. Trueman has made a hobby of photographing the island's scenery and wildlife.
"It's hard not to," he says.
The island is on a migratory bird route. The Truemans report sightings of tundra swans, Great Blue herons, goldfinches and yellow warblers. Species of owls include Boreal, Great Horned, Long-eared and Great Grey.
Deer, coyotes and foxes also abound.
The first year, Mr. Trueman says, "we found ourselves running from window to window."
Lake Ontario is very popular with sailors, while the more sheltered Bay of Quinte on the other side of the island also attracts sail and speed boats. The Truemans sometimes take a canoe or kayak out from the rocky beach at the foot of their bluffs, but the ride can be wild.
"You treat Lake Ontario with a lot of respect."
The island's 400 or so residents include farmers, cottagers and people who commute to work on the mainland.
"We all know each other," says Mr. Trueman. "We recognize each other by our cars."
There is a local farmer's market on the island, and the shops, restaurants, theatres and attractions of Kingston are a ferry ride and a short drive away.
United Empire Loyalists were the first to settle on the island in the 1790s. Then, immigrants from Ireland began farming. Many of those living on Amherst today are descendants of those early families from the Ards Peninsula in Ireland.
Ms. McIntire-Smyth also lives on the island. She's related to the family which operated Stella's renowned cheese factory, founded in the 1860s.
"Amherst Island cheese was sent all over North America and to England," she says.
One measure of the compact size and long-established history of Amherst Island is a guide to local attractions, in which the history and architectural details of singular houses and farms are described.
Even individual sheep are named. Icicle, for example, lives on a farm established in 1850. The highly personable sheep gives a "high five", bestows kisses and loves to roam freely, according to the guidebook.
The astonishingly-detailed account by island resident Judith Harrower also includes anecdotes about the occupations, lifestyles, ancestors, mortgages, marriages, offspring, political affiliations, paint colours and foibles of generations of island residents.
Ms. Harrower provides quirky stories of an array of local characters, including a grandmother who stood up to attackers and saved the family's wealth during the Rebellions of 1837.
An abandoned house nearby is identified as the former home to a bachelor who took his potatoes to bed with him in winter to keep them from freezing.
Ms. McIntire-Smyth says that kind of lore is typical of the island's culture because so many families have deep-set roots.
Mr. Trueman has continued his journalism career while living on Amherst Island. He has written newspaper columns, taken to the airwaves again on local radio and hosted a television series called Great Canadian Parks.
The latter he calls "the best job I ever had".
"The worst part of that was missing summers on the island," Mr. Trueman says. "This place has been a wonderful haven."

Listing agent:

This two-storey house is close to a busy street, but few would know it standing on the professionally landscaped grounds overlooking a small park at the end of the cul-de-sac, agent Theodore Babiak says.
"It's a really short walk to Bloor Street, but it's still really tucked away," he says. "It's quite beautiful that way."
Adding to the picturesque setting are perennial flowers and a flagstone pathway encircling the south-facing backyard.
About 20 years ago, a previous owner - local architect, Ronald Raanan Matthews - altered the 1940s house to make the most of its scenic surroundings and sunny exposures.
There is a large sliding door to a steel beam framed deck off the family room and a heated solarium off the fireside living room.
Skylights are installed in two out of three full bathrooms and one bedroom upstairs, while triangular, greenhouse-style windows protrude from three other bedrooms.
"The light in this house is fantastic," the agent says.
Within the past decade, the sellers gave the 2,168-square-foot house new roofing, updated wiring, and stainless steel kitchen appliances, among other things.
The cosmetic makeover consisted of freshly painted interiors, leaded glass French doors in the office, and new hardwood, carpeting, ceramic tile and granite finishes throughout.
"In every part of the house, there were things that were done to update the place," Mr. Babiak says. "It was really a carefree home."
Other notable features include custom cupboards in the eat-in kitchen, built-in speakers in several rooms and a master bathroom with heated floors, a glass shower stall and built-in storage.
In the refinished basement, there is a recreation room with a home theatre system and side exit, a powder room and access to a revamped garage.

Full text: Built in 1860, heritage home sucked up both time and money in a thorough renovation
137292 Grey Road 12
What: A landmark limestone house set on 100 acres of softly rolling hills near Meaford, Ont. Besides the 2-storey main residence, the property includes a large barn in pristine condition, presently used for storage, as well as a small guest cottage presently being rented out to out-of-towners on sabbatical.
Living space: 4,000 square feet
Asking price: $2.75-million
Taxes: $2,012 (2009)
Agent: Clairwood Real Estate Corp. (Sherry Rioux)
Jim Brunow worked as a government accountant before retiring in 2006 to pursue his hobby of restoring century-old Ontario homes.
The latest of these, where he now lives full-time with partner Sue LaVigne, is a Georgian style house perched high on a hill with unobstructed views of the Niagara Escarpment and Georgian Bay.
"The setting is spectacular," Mr. Brunow says. "There are views in every direction including the Big Head River Valley, the Niagara Escarpment and Georgian Bay. On a clear day you can see all the way to Christian Island."
Originally built in 1860, the main residence is made of hand-hewn limestone, a specialty of Scottish settlers who settled there in the late 19th century on crown land they received as United Empire Loyalists.
So many Scots emigrated to the area that the rise of the Niagara Escarpment where the house is located is called Scotch Mountain. There, "the soil is as fertile as any found in St. Vincent Township," says Mr. Brunow, quoting from a local history book published by the St. Vincent Heritage Association.
His house is also mentioned in the book, with a description of the original owner, one James Storey who heralded from Roxburghshire, Scotland. Unfortunately, little more is known of him.
But the elegant layout and harmonic proportions of his four bedroom, three -bathroom house suggests he may have been a man of considerable pride and taste.
Proof lies in some of the original details that Mr. Brunow discovered when he first bought the house in 1993, including a hand-carved banister on a pine staircase leading from the front foyer up to the second floor.
Having only four previous owners, the house had not undergone many changes over time, a situation both good and bad according to the present homeowner.
Good, because it allowed Mr. Brunow, a stickler for historic detail - most of the lighting and plumbing fixtures, including a copper claw foot tub with oak trim, were all fastidiously sourced from antique sales and shows across the province - to determine what the house must have first looked like.
Bad, because it was run down, and required large amounts of both time and money to whip it back into shape.
As Mr. Brunow explains it, the house had to be gutted and rebuilt, with the remaining original detail supplemented by reproductions created by local craftsman, including oversized clear pine trim, plaster cornice mouldings, solid wood doors and solid brass hardware.
The pine floors were restored and all the stonework repainted.
Besides a new roof, Mr. Brunow also built a new two-storey addition onto the back of the house that now houses a sunroom.
On the upper floor, the addition makes room for an expanded (19- by 20-foot) master bedroom with cathedral ceilings, heated floors and sunken ensuite with windows opening onto a mature hardwood forest.
While the house now has two furnaces, the renovated kitchen also features a new $6,000 cast iron wood stove that provides added warmth in winter.
Also in the kitchen, local carpenter Kim Hall, from nearby Thornbury, Ont., has created a large central island made of wood distressed to look as if it were original.
Mr. Hall also made the wooden window frames, each one hand carved, basing their thickness on what had originally been in the house.
"I've always appreciated the quality and craftsmanship of century homes in Ontario," Mr. Brunow says.
"Restoring this home was a labour of love."

Full text: But property-tax rebate ruled out
CITY HALL BUREAU CHIEF
Toronto residents will receive refunds for children's day camps, swimming lessons and leadership programs cancelled because of the city workers strike.
At a city hall press conference, Mayor David Miller ruled out a rebate on property taxes that help pay for city services suspended since the strike by Locals 79 and 416 of the Canadian Union of Public Employees began June 22.
"We won't be doing that," he said.
More details of the city refunds are expected to be released today.
As for possible relief on garbage collection fees - a new pay-as-you-throw system is in its first full year of operation - Mr. Miller said no decision has been made.
"There are a number of alternatives we could pursue," he said.
As well, the mayor announced a special council meeting at city hall for Aug. 5 and 6 to deal with about 50 "truly urgent" items left in limbo when a July 6 council meeting was cancelled because of the strike.
But if the labour dispute is settled before Aug. 5, Mr. Miller said he would scrap the two-day session and hold a full council meeting the following week.
Leading the list of "urgent" items is the selection of a private sector investor, possibly the real-estate arm of a major pension fund, to refurbish of city-owned Union Station.
Council would also be asked to approve final plans for the Sony Centre condo, clearing the way to complete renovation of the Sony Centre for the Performing Arts, dark for the past year.
Some of the mayor's council critics have clamoured for a meeting with a wider agenda, including a mandatory freeze on a 2.4-per-cent cost of living raise for councillors and a debate about the ongoing strike by 30,000 civic workers.
Councillor Case Ootes (Ward 29, Toronto-Danforth), spokesman for the right-leaning Responsible Government Group, said there was no reason to cancel the July 6 meeting "other than he [Mr. Miller] did not want to have his NDP caucus cross the picket line."
At his press conference, Mr. Miller said the city's medical officer of health had ordered pesticide spraying of Campbell Park and a pickup of illegal garbage dumped at Bluffers Park, both stymied by pickets.
If the work cannot be carried out, the mayor said the city would seek court injunctions.
Neither the mayor nor spokesmen for the two CUPE locals had much to say about the progress of talks on new contracts to replace those that expired Dec. 31.
As of yesterday, the city reported that 824 unionized workers had asked to cross the picket lines and return to their jobs.
Approvals have been given for 597 so far.
***
Strike refunds
For which programs
will the city refund fees?
The city says it will return fees for all city-run day camps, swimming lessons and leadership programs cancelled because of the strike.
The city's FUN Guide lists hundreds of summer camp programs at more than 230 locations throughout the city, with many costing hundreds of dollars per session.
The guide also lists summer swimming programs for all ages at more than 80 pools throughout the city, which cost about $30 to $70 per week.
Leadership programs include babysitting training and other courses, such as Leaders in Training and the Youth Advisory Council.

Full text: Vancouver has stolen Calgary's crown as the city with the highest net worth.
In a soon-to-be-published database that looks at how Canadians handled their wealth during the rapid change of fortunes that marred 2008, Environics Analytics exposes profound changes in the way people approach their wealth.
Canadians have seen their nest eggs shrivel, beefed up their savings, scaled back their borrowing, and embraced caution, an abrupt change in attitude that will likely persist, says Catherine Pearson, vice-president of Environics Analytics in Toronto.
Generally, the research, which crunches and dissects numbers from 80 different sources and goes into deep local detail, found that the richer Canadians were, the harder they fell.
"The more money you have, the more you have to lose," Ms. Pearson said.
In Calgary, net worth fell as the value of household investments plunged and debt climbed.
In Vancouver, though, consumers saved more and real estate fared better last year.
Net worth, which measures someone's assets minus debts, dropped 6.2 per cent for Canadians as a whole last year. But Calgary residents saw their wealth plunge 12.3 per cent, while Vancouver's residents were able to hang on to much of their riches. There, net worth fell just 3.1 per cent between December, 2007, and December, 2008.
Now Vancouver's residents have taken first place for household net worth, while Calgary has fallen to second place.
Vancouverite Sebastian Albrecht rode that Pacific wave. He has a lot of his money tied up in real estate. And it's these investments - with prices down less than 10 per cent from their peak last year - that has made the city surrounded by mountains and ocean the richest in Canada, supplanting the country's energy capital Calgary.
Mr. Albrecht bought his first condo a decade ago, after university. He stretched himself - and slept in a sleeping bag on the floor for a couple months in the unfurnished home.
A decade later, he lives in a $600,000 home that he bought two years ago for $500,000 and also owns - and rents out - a $350,000 town home and a $300,000 condo. He has some money in stocks, but only about 10 per cent of his net worth.
Born in the city, an entrepreneur at heart, the 34-year-old worked in IT and then started a clothing import-export business and dabbled in real estate - until he became a realtor himself three years ago, a perch from which he sees a cross-section of Vancouver and the people who generate the city's wealth. From movie makers to junior mining players, it is a diffuse mix.
"The difference in Vancouver is it's more diverse than a lot of areas in Canada," Mr. Albrecht says. "Calgary has oil. Toronto is finance. Here, there's a lot of creativity. I'm amazed how some people make money here."
Vancouver's net worth per household is an average of $575,826, while Calgary's is $569,926, the research shows.
Compare that with Newfoundland, where household net worth is typically $140,706, or even to Ontario, where average household wealth is $354,968.
Most of Calgary's losses stemmed from a plunge in the value of investments held by households, such as stocks, bonds and mutual funds. At the same time, Calgarians took on large liabilities in the past year, and Calgary is now the home of the most heavily indebted people in Canada. Albertans in general have 30 per cent more consumer debt than the average Canadian, the research shows. And the mortgage debt of many young people has soared.
"Perhaps they simply haven't realized the fact that the heady boom days are now over," the researchers said in their analysis.
Vancouver residents, on the other hand, were able to mitigate their exposure to the ravages of the recession by increasing savings, and by benefiting from more stability in the housing market in 2008.
The survey doesn't cover 2009. In the first six months of this year, prices for existing homes were down 8.6 per cent in Vancouver from the same period of last year, and 9.8 per cent in Calgary, resale statistics show.
Perhaps because they're less wounded than the rest of the country, British Columbians are piling back into the stock market faster than elsewhere.
But people in Quebec and Ontario are gun-shy, and are stashing away any extra money they have in safe places. Quebec households in particular have low credit card debt, and boosted their holdings of sure-thing guaranteed investment certificates by 5 per cent over the course of the year. Deposits in banks and credit unions have risen 4.9 per cent.
People in Ontario, where the recession has hit hardest, increased their term deposits by 15.3 per cent and increased their debt loads by just 3.0 per cent - much less than the national average increase of 8.1 per cent.
"Hats off to Ontario households for being fiscally responsible," the researchers said.
Still, Ontarians were paying dearly for such debt. Residents were using 7.1 per cent of their disposable income to pay interest charges - 20-per-cent higher than the national average of 6.3 per cent. In Alberta, servicing non-mortgage debt ate up just 6.1 per cent of discretionary income, despite the rising debt loads.
Indeed, Albertans' discretionary income was higher than anywhere else in the country, at $53,237 per household. That was 29-per-cent higher than second-place Ontario.
The oil-rich province may have been hammered by the global recession, but households still have plenty of wealth. "Alberta's got the spending power," the researchers conclude.

Full text: With small-town charm and film-friendly tax perks, Rockport, Mass. is getting plenty of screen time, whether it's playing itself or not
jschneller@globeandmail.com
I spent last week in Rockport, Mass., which initially seems as far from Hollywood as you can get, both geographically and psychologically. Settled in the 1620s, it's a former fishing village northeast of Boston on the tip of Cape Ann. It boasts 238-year-old twin lighthouses on Thacher Island, and granite from its quarries helped build Chicago and New York in the 1800s. It's now full of quaintly rickety fish shacks, art galleries and ice-cream shops, and the empty quarries have become spookily sensual swimming holes. But the more I hung around, the more I realized that Hollywood's tentacles reach, and are eagerly embraced, everywhere.
My first tipoff was the poster on the Little Arts Cinema, which is normally a haven for subtitled European fare. But for the last two weeks, the theatre has been showing The Proposal , the paint-by-numbers romantic comedy starring Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds that's grossed $115-million (U.S.) so far. The theatre's answering machine informs callers that the movie was "filmed last year in Rockport, and shows nightly at 7 and 9."
My second clue was running into Adam Sandler on a Sunday morning at a breakfast joint called Charlie's, which is usually more famous for its Portuguese sausage and anadama bread (a local specialty made with molasses) than its clientele. It turns out Sandler's in town shooting Grown Ups , a comedy scheduled for 2010 about five friends who reunite 30 years after their high-school graduation for a Fourth of July weekend. It's a wonder we didn't see more cast members, since they are legion, including Salma Hayek, Steve Buscemi, Kevin James and enough Saturday Night Live alums to form their own reunion.
My third hint was the Perfect Storm map that directs visitors to sites around Rockport and its neighbour Gloucester where the 2000 movie, starring George Clooney and Mark Wahlberg, was filmed. It's a tragedy, about real-life local fisherman whose names, sadly, are now inscribed on a Gloucester monument commemorating "they that go down to the sea in ships." But that hasn't dissuaded the tourists - they continue to come in such numbers that the Cape Ann Chamber of Commerce hung the map in its lobby.
Hollywood is invading because Massachusetts is inviting it to. The commonwealth dramatically upgraded its tax credits in 2006, giving filmmakers back 25 cents for every dollar they spend, with no pre-authorization and no caps. They're also exempt from sales tax on any production-related purchases made in the state. As a result, 25 major movies have been filmed in Massachusetts in the past three years including Ghosts of Girlfriends Past (shot in the Crane Estate, the same place where Jack Nicholson lived in The Witches of Eastwick ) and The Proposal .
I found it odd, however, that Rockport has embraced The Proposal so whole-heartedly. Though some of its landmarks appear on screen - including Motif No. 1, a red shack covered in buoys - the film isn't set there. The story takes place in Sitka, Alaska; snow-capped peaks have been CGI'd behind the fishing boats.
But Bob Hastings, the executive director of the Cape Ann Chamber of Commerce, set me straight. "Everyone loved having the film here, with Betty White downtown and so on," he said. Whenever Cape Ann appears on screen, whether it's playing itself or not, it sees a rise in "after-fact tourism" from travel-minded audiences savvy enough to stick around to spot the location in a film's closing credits. And then there's all the lovely dough the filmmakers spend while shooting.
" Grown Ups paid a lot of money to rent a city property in Essex, and on top of that they completely renovated it," Hastings said. "And the stars all rent homes on the water, which they pay top dollar for, tens of thousands of dollars." Actors like shooting here, he added, because "residents think it's fun, but they're not overwhelmed. There's no autograph seeking."
Bullock did make local headlines in April 2008 when the car she and her husband, Jesse James, were riding in through Gloucester was hit by a native, 64-year-old Lucile Gatchell. No one was hurt, but Gatchell, who blew more than twice the legal limit on the Breathalyzer, was arrested and charged with operating under the influence. Crowds lined Main Street to watch Bullock film one scene, largely because she got to drive up it the wrong way. And Arnie Morton, who runs the Little Arts Cinema, just extended The Proposal 's run for a third week. "I don't know if it's the record for the longest we've shown one film, but it's close," he said. "We're getting nice feedback, though people do snicker when they see the artificial mountains."
During Sandler's breakfast outing, Charlie's was packed; people waiting for tables wrote their first names on a whiteboard, and the line stretched out the door. Sandler's party of 11 (his two kids, plus his wife, nanny and various relatives) was right behind my party of five, and he was waiting like everybody else.
Well, not quite like everybody else. When Sandler went to put his name on the board, the woman ahead of me called out, "I gotcha, Adam," and wrote down his full name, "Adam Sandler," with a flourish. Then her husband took a picture of it on his cellphone - the whiteboard, not the actor.
In the restaurant, Sandler seated himself against a wall so it was hard for people to get at him, but in the parking lot with his restless kids, a stream of fans hit him up for cellphone photos.
I was momentarily impressed by our teenaged waitress, who bustled around him coolly. But then I saw her recognize him: She stood stock-still and stared at him for a full minute.
The truth is, for all its scrappy history, Rockport is like everywhere else in the United States, subject to the siren song of the silver screen. Hollywood is so pervasive in American culture, and the air its celebrities breathe seems so rarefied, that ordinary mortals can't help but delight in accidental encounters with stars - or in merely standing in the spot where one recently stood. When you're in the same place as Them, you can believe that your life is the same as Theirs, if just for a moment.
"A friend of mine had the good fortune of being on a stationary bike at the YMCA right behind Salma Hayek," Hastings said. Who could argue with the joys of that?

Full text: Is this a dagger I see before me? No, but Shakespearean actor Colm Feore has lots of other sharp things in his kitchen. Deidre Kelly reports Is this a dagger I see before me? No, but Shakespearean actor Colm Feore has lots of other sharp things in his kitchen. Deirdre Kelly reports
Actor Colm Feore has a thing for sharp, pointed objects.
In Macbeth , which he is currently starring in at the Stratford Shakespeare Festival, he hallucinates about daggers, and in Cyrano de Bergerac , he thrusts swords into enemies and barbed words into the ears of dolts.
But this is all child's play in comparison to the quantity and variety of knives that this blade of the stage wields inside his own home, located in Stratford. There, in a large, open-concept kitchen designed to accommodate the full range of his far-reaching culinary skills - his other passion - Mr. Feore performs some of his more dexterous acts with a vast array of cutting utensils kept inside custom-made beech drawers.
Among them are carving knives, paring knives and melon slicers, serrated knives for bread and Yanagi knives for sushi. There are also ham-fisted cleavers and thin filleting knives, stub-nosed knives to spread butter and thick-bladed knives to shuck oysters.
All are honed to within an inch of their metallic lives and no wonder, when it is Mr. Feore doing the sharpening. Call it his backstage job.
"I'm all about sharp knives, and I sharpen them all myself," said the 50-year-old thespian recently as he cut through a mango with lightening speed, in preparation for lunch. "I go through the back door of restaurants around town asking to cut their knives. I try to practice, whenever and wherever I can. I use a sharpening stone soaked in water. It's not easy. But it's fun - if you like that kind of thing."
And Mr. Feore clearly does, making knives something of a hobby (shopping the world for them, and happy to get knives as gifts), if not an obsession.
When he goes to someone's house, he doesn't bring a bottle of wine as much as his own knives, wrapped inside a soft-cover, roll-up carrying case. These he calls his travelling knives, which he also takes to Los Angeles when making one of his many films: "The bottom line is you go to someone's house, and you want to cook, and they hand you a 50-cent knife. I mean, it just can't work."
To minimize these encounters of the dull kind, Mr. Feore often plays it safe by cooking at home where he knows the kitchen is as sharply efficient as one of his steel blades.
He designed it mostly himself, in consultation with local architect Michael Wilson, who built an addition onto Mr. Feore's vintage Arts and Crafts house (where an outdoor pool once was) in order to accommodate everything his exacting client wanted in this room of his own.
This included a heated travertine floor, three fridges of various sizes, including one in a central island with a black marble countertop, and a 60-inch-wide, stainless steel Viking double-oven range, equipped with six burners and rolled steel on which Mr. Feore flips his made-from-scratch pancakes - a skill he says he learned on the set of the 2002 television miniseries, Trudeau .
While he shares the 1917 house with his three children and wife Donna Feore, the Stratford director who this season directed her husband in Cyrano (past collaborations include the 2006 production of Oliver! ), the kitchen is his domain: "I do all the cooking here. Donna doesn't cook, if she can help it, at all."
Her main contribution lies in the choice of an original porthole, taken from the docks of Montreal, as a window that looks out from the kitchen into the side foyer. "Donna likes round windows," says Mr. Feore, adding that the design element is repeated elsewhere in the four-bedroom, three-bathroom stone house with a fenced-in, landscaped garden. He likes them too, he says, especially at Halloween when he uses the porthole to "pull a Richard Dreyfus," while vocalizing the theme from Jaws .
The Feores have owned the house for 12 years, but didn't start the renovation until 2002. It took a year to complete, with the actor and his family moving across the street to a friend's house to wait it out. The result is a room that Mr. Feore calls "not too formal, but very functional," with high vaulted ceilings and windows for walls to enhance what he calls "an indoor/outdoor feel."
Ms. Feore enjoys conducting business at home, and so the kitchen enlarges into a big dining and family room (with a study area for the kids) where she and as many as six festival colleagues can sit around the dining table, thrashing out plans for a new production.
Mr. Feore feeds them all, and happily: "It gives me a sense of purpose," he says.
You think this Gemini Award-winning actor, known for his star turns in the likes of the box-office hit Bon Cop, Bad Cop and the TV-series 24is joking.
But then he fixes you with his razor-sharp gaze and you know to listen up.
"Cooking keeps me out of trouble, and it keeps me engaged in something creative," he continues, speaking slowly as he places slices of fruit around a wedge of French chocolate on offer as dessert.
"But cooking is apart from what I do where I have to take direction and go to work, and please other people. Here," he says, his knife poised in the air for emphasis, "I please myself. I make things up, come up with my own inventions."
And without fear of a bad review.
Mr. Feore adds, not putting too fine a point on it: "If people don't like the food, they don't have to eat."
Touché.

Abstract: It also offers a bird's-eye view of Blood Alley and the building's south-facing ground-floor space - the site of a new tapas bar by local entrepreneur Sean Heather, whose nearby Salt charcuterie bar is one of many local businesses helping to inject new life into the area. "One of our goals in designing the mixed-use space," Mr. [Mark Ostry] says, "was to foster a sense of the alley as an urban gathering place."

Full text: At the now complete Terminus Hotel, Acton Ostry Architects meet the challenge of melding modern living spaces with a historic frame
For many years, the old Terminus Hotel building on Water Street in historic Gastown stood like a piece of installation art. Gutted by a fire in 2000, all that was left was its 1901 façade, supported by steel columns that backed onto a vacant lot marked by crater-like excavations. Bordered to the south by Blood Alley, once a thriving commercial laneway turned hangout for the area's destitute and drug-addicted, the Terminus had already weathered the great fire of 1886 and turn-of-the century demolition before its more recent brush with mortality.
But the Terminus is nothing if not building as neighbourhood metaphor. And so just as neatly as Gastown has morphed from derelict to designer darling, with a string of new retail and restaurant options lifting the area out of its nineties slump, so too has the Terminus risen from the ashes of its former incarnations.
Developed by Vancouver-based Salient Group together with the remains of the next door Grand Hotel, it has emerged as a slick new mixed-use residential project designed by Acton Ostry Architects, with interiors by David Nicolay of Evoke International Design.
The historic Water Street entrance remains the same, with original columns in place, and it leads into a narrow corridor where original tin ceiling panels are displayed gallery style.
But, says Mark Ostry, whose firm is also designing the adjacent mixed-use residential project Garage and mixed-use commercial Alhambra, both built on the bones of venerable buildings: "We wanted to avoid anything that smacked of faux heritage. Architecture should be an expression of current culture, of its time and place."
The challenge with the project, he says, was to manage the tension between the need to respect the heritage of the building and, at the same time, to maximize density. To a certain degree this was facilitated by the interior having been completely gutted by the fire, but keeping the original façade meant that interior dimensions were often dictated by the existing structure.
To that end Mr. Nicolay, who worked closely and collaboratively with Mr. Ostry, had to be inventive with the vary narrow - 10-foot-wide units whose dimensions were set by the north-facing turn-of-the-century bay windows. (Some south-facing units that overlook Blood Alley - they benefit from a new façade built of reclaimed brick - did not have the same constraints.) The trick with the units overlooking Water Street, Mr. Nicolay says, was to play with textures and dimensions.
Just as Mr. Ostry strived to maintain the "granular" nature of the building's façade, delineating exterior space by setting back south-facing windows on the old Grand Hotel side so the building wouldn't read as single homogeneous unit, so too has Mr. Nicolay differentiated long narrow interior spaces with individual details.
While each of the 46 units has a different floor plan, many feature three-foot-wide 18-foot-long bathrooms that run the length of the entrance way. To avoid having the interior read as one continuous narrow corridor, each segment of living space has its own character, with the overall effect being a sense of calm procession.
One second-floor unit, for instance, begins with a bedroom space and built-in cabinetry that is followed by the narrow bathroom. But at this juncture the flooring changes from linear strand walnut to sand-coloured porcelain tile that also runs up the wall. The bathroom doors are frosted tempered glass. The transition into the kitchen and living space is marked by a return to walnut flooring and steel countertops with a white glass backsplash that lights up.
To address the challenge of having only one natural light source in a narrow space, Mr. Nicolay used concealed soffit lighting to illuminate the interior.
A two-storey unit plays with levels and dimensions. An entrance lobby reveals the 16-foot ceiling to the left that contrasts with the lower ceiling supporting the second floor. The result is a kind of compressed space that proceeds through the kitchen area and then steps up a few feet into a living area that reveals the full height of the ceiling once again - offering a luxurious sense of spaciousness.
It also offers a bird's-eye view of Blood Alley and the building's south-facing ground-floor space - the site of a new tapas bar by local entrepreneur Sean Heather, whose nearby Salt charcuterie bar is one of many local businesses helping to inject new life into the area. "One of our goals in designing the mixed-use space," Mr. Ostry says, "was to foster a sense of the alley as an urban gathering place."
Several storeys up, an as yet unsold 1,700-square-foot penthouse wows with its curtain wall glazing, phenomenal city view and private roof garden.
"The space is very flexible," says Mr. Ostry, noting that most of the occupied units function as living and working spaces for artists.
An adjoining communal room and roof garden offer a social area where residents can gather for a shared meal or a coffee.
Mr. Ostry cites the forward thinking of Salient Group developer Robert Fung, who "could have easily turned this into a million-dollar apartment."
But, he says, "you have to create community by design. It's a conscious decision."
The roof garden features reclaimed brick from the original building as well as extensive landscaping - with local drought resistant plants. And the view is extraordinary. From the edge of the new Woodward's building to the tip of the old Sun Tower, to the turn of the century façades on Pender Street and the backside of Arthur Erickson's Portland Hotel - it reads like an historical civic panorama.

Full text: The last plan to build a high-rise beside the ROM was scrapped. Let's not mess up a second chance
jmays@globeandmail.com
In a real-estate deal, earlier this year, that left many parties cheering, the Royal Ontario Museum (ROM) sold off the McLaughlin Planetarium site, on the south end of the venerable institution, to the University of Toronto. "This is a win-win-win for the U of T, the ROM and the public," university president David Naylor told Globe columnist John Barber at the time.
Dr. Naylor's first winner, the university, acquired a property that is apparently needed for expansion. It's hard for me to see how the tiny planetarium site will ease the U of T's shortage of office and teaching space - But never mind: If university officials are glad to get this little patch of land, I'm happy for them.
The second winner in Dr. Naylor's scenario was the museum, which netted $22-million from the sale. Having ended its recent $270-million expansion some $85-million in the hole, the ROM could certainly use the money.
Dr. Naylor's inclusion of the "public" in his list of winners, however, bothers me. I am not at all sure that the public interest has been well served by the sale. Furthermore, I believe that a remarkable opportunity to enhance Toronto's urban fabric, and the fabric of the university, could very well be lost.
To understand the nature of this loss, we have to go back four years, to the time when ROM director William Thorsell announced his intention to raise a residential tower on the planetarium site. This building, as proposed by the Toronto architectural firm of Brisbin Brook Beynon, would have had two components, a 40-storey luxury condominium block atop a five-storey, 35,000-square-foot annex to the museum.
The outcry against the tower came fast and furious, from the university as well as residents in the ROM neighbourhood. The objections were less to the specific design than to the very idea of putting up a tall building on the edge of the university precinct. To its opponents, the structure would be an impudent contradiction to the scale of the university's St. George campus, which is largely (but by no means exclusively) composed of low- to mid-rise structures. But for its principal designer, Brian Brisbin, the tower would serve as a beacon and landmark, giving a focus to the sprawling campus. The end of the affair came after a raucous public meeting in late 2005, when the ROM, admitting that the opposition was overwhelming, withdrew the scheme.
Now that the U of T controls the site, there is only the faintest chance that the tower plan will ever be revived. I believed in 2005 that the ROM's cancellation of the project was a mistake, and I believe in 2009, for the same reasons, that the university will be wrong to ignore the merits of putting up a tall building on the rubble of the mothballed planetarium.
My reasons are not complicated. If the university in fact needs more space for its activities - and I have no doubt that it does - then a mixed-use tall building, developed in a private-public investment partnership, could be an efficient, cost-effective way to get it. The planetarium site offers the university a gleaming opportunity to expand, though upward instead of outward - an attractive option, or so it seems to me, in light of the tight circumstances of the St. George campus, which is hemmed in on all sides by well-rooted neighbourhoods and institutions.
My main reason for believing the university should press on with a new mixed-use tower plan, however, has less to do with square footage than with the potentially ennobling effect of such a scheme on the city and the campus. The U of T is one of Canada's great research universities, famed for its contributions to science, the professions and the humanistic disciplines. A tall building, designed and constructed according to the highest standards, could be a visible expression of the university's stature and standing, emblazoned on the city's skyline.
It would have to be a very special building, of course; but there is nothing standing in the way of it being exactly that. Though Toronto has seldom been a beneficiary, the last decade has been a golden age of innovative, exciting skyscraper design, like nothing seen since the heyday of romantic tall buildings in the 1920s. An international competition co-ordinated by the university could attract the brightest and most talented skyscraper designers in the world, enriching the local conversation about building tall and well, and eventually giving the city and the campus a soaring structure that would declare their commitment to the best contemporary ideas of beauty, sustainability and urban form.
In buying the planetarium site, the U of T has acquired an outstanding opportunity. I hope they don't throw it away.

Abstract: PBS, 8 p.m.Released to theatres in 1967, this movie drew notice for the presence of John Lennon in his first and only film acting role (other than Beatles films). Set during the Second World War, the black comedy stars Michael Crawford as British Army officer Lieutenant Earnest Goodbody, the ineffective leader put in charge of a fighting troop inexplicably known as the 4th Musketeers. His charges include Lennon as the lowly Musketeer Gripweed and Roy Kinnear as Musketeer Clapper.

JULY 17
DRAMA
The Outer Limits
Showcase, 7 p.m.The spirit of the creepy TV anthology lives in this filmed-in-Canada series. First broadcast on the U.S. cable channel Showtime, the show was an update of the original Outer Limits that aired in the early sixties. Tonight's show is a standout: Character actor Joe Pantoliano, best remembered from his stint as the mobster Ralph on The Sopranos , plays Stan Harbinger, a popular radio host with a reputation for debunking the supernatural. After a caller claiming to be possessed by aliens sets himself afire, Harbinger is haunted by ghostly images - and the man's distinctive triple heartbeat. Scary stuff.
MOVIE
How I Won the War
PBS, 8 p.m.Released to theatres in 1967, this movie drew notice for the presence of John Lennon in his first and only film acting role (other than Beatles films). Set during the Second World War, the black comedy stars Michael Crawford as British Army officer Lieutenant Earnest Goodbody, the ineffective leader put in charge of a fighting troop inexplicably known as the 4th Musketeers. His charges include Lennon as the lowly Musketeer Gripweed and Roy Kinnear as Musketeer Clapper. The film's anti-war sentiment is evinced in the group's meaningless activities and the platoon's repeated attempts to frag their commander. Not a classic, but Lennon is a surprisingly good actor.
CRIME DRAMA
Heartbeat
TVO, 9 p.m.Set in 1960s Yorkshire, Heartbeat began airing on ITV in 1992 and lasted 18 seasons; on more than one occasion the show earned higher ratings than Coronation Street - no small feat on U.K. television. In tonight's show, the disappearance of a local teenager leads police to suspect her American boyfriend, who was desperately trying to avoid deportation.
FOOD
Chef Abroad
Food Network, 9:30 p.m.Chef Michael Smith is the reason to watch this whimsical series seeking out exciting food experiences around the globe. In this episode, he ventures into the California kitchen of the Internet giant known as Google, where 10,000 meals are served each day. Smith adheres to the local food-prep rules - all ingredients must come from within 150 miles of the company - and adds several new menu items that have the Web-surfers buzzing.
SATURDAY jULY 18
BIOGRAPHY
Role Model: Gene Wilder
TCM, 7 p.m.
This biography of Gene Wilder is a remarkable film. The format has Alec Baldwin sitting down for an extended interview with the famed comic actor, who considers himself "semi-retired". The conversation covers the high points of Wilder's film career, including The Producers and co-writing and starring in Young Frankenstein . More touching are Wilder's memories of wife Gilda Radner, who died from ovarian cancer in 1989.
MOVIE
Wilby Wonderful
CTV, 8 p.m.Filmed on location in Shelburne, N.S., the story follows several residents of a small island named Wilby. Quirky locals include the aggressive real-estate agent Carol (Sandra Oh) and her rugged police-officer husband, Buddy (Paul Gross). Also tossed into the mix is a pre- Juno Ellen Page as the confused teen Emily and Maury Chaykin as Wilby's windbag mayor. The film follows the characters in the days leading up to Wilby's annual festival.
DRAMA
Intelligence
CBC, 10 p.m.Unlike many Canadian-made dramas, Intelligence holds up. Lasting two seasons, the show follows two intertwining storylines: Ian Tracey plays Jimmy Reardon, a likable guy making millions wheeling and dealing high-grade marijuana; Klea Scott is Organized Crime Unit director Mary Spalding, who offered Reardon prosecution immunity in exchange for his work as a police informant. In tonight's first-season episode, Reardon obtains a truckload of phony ATM machines to help him launder his drug money. The bad move: putting his shiftless brother in charge of the operation.
SUNDAY JULY 19
MOVIE
The Wizard of Oz
CBC, 5 p.m.
Holding up astoundingly well for a 70-year-old story, The Wizard of Oz remains the consummate family experience. Viewing the 1939 classic has become a TV tradition, of sorts. Parents who grew up watching Dorothy, the Scarecrow, Tin Man and the Cowardly Lion trip down the yellow brick road now pass the torch to their kids. Watch it again for the grand performances and such beautiful tunes as Over the Rainbow -voted the greatest movie song of all time by the American Film Institute.
DOCUMENTARY
MegaStructures
TVO, 7 p.m.
It's a safe bet this series is used as a teaching tool in postsecondary courses on architecture and design. Each episode is a detailed primer on a construction project of enormous scope. Some are famous and functional (ie: the Hoover Dam), others are frivolous (the Palm Islands of Dubai). Tonight: The man-made marvel of the Channel Tunnel, the 50.5 kilometre underground rail line that links England and France. The program details the engineering challenges and reveals the fierce competition between the two countries to complete the project.
DRAMA
Desperate Housewives
ABC, A, 9 p.m.
From last season, it's an episode that seems geared toward lean economic reality. Hard times hit Wisteria Lane and the principal Housewives are feeling the pinch. Normally ditzy Susan (Teri Hatcher) is forced to take a job, but full-time work is not a good fit. Slow sales force Lynette (Felicity Huffman) to consider selling the pizzeria. And impish Gaby (Eva Longoria Parker) blackmails her hubby's boss into giving him a big bonus.
CRIME DRAMA
Without a Trace
CBS, CTV, 10 p.m.
Actress Nicholle Tom, who played a precocious kid for several seasons of The Nanny , guests as Molly Simons, an online journalist who switched from writing celebrity gossip to hard-hitting exposes. When she disappears, family and co-workers point to an allegedly corrupt politician recently skewered by the reporter. Senior agent Jack Malone (Anthony LaPaglia) has a different theory.
MONDAY
JULY 20
CRIME DRAMA
Law & Order:
Criminal Intent
NBC, CTV, 9 p.m.
The teaming of Detectives Wheeler (Julianne Nicholson) and Nichols (Jeff Goldblum) gave this crime-drama a boost last season. Two years ago CI was relegated to the NBC-owned USA Network - the TV equivalent of being sent to the minors - but the show has returned strongly on the mother network. Tonight: A former Olympic medalist and employee of the Belgian consulate is found shot in the head. The investigation leads the detective duoto the Olympic site selection committee.
COMEDY
Two and a Half Men
CBS, 9 p.m.The simple format of has made Two and a Half Men a constant fixture in syndication, and the show benefits greatly from flawless casting: Neurotic non-alpha male Alan is a role made for Jon Cryer, still every bit as needy as when he was Ducky in Pretty in Pink ; sleazy womanizing brother Charlie is played by Charlie Sheen. Tonight, Alan moves out, then moves back, and a lesson is learned. COMEDY
Futurama
Teletoon, 9 p.m.
The only animated series to measure up to The Simpsons , Futurama is a faithful half-hour time-killer. Both series were created by Matt Groening, but Futurama presents more fanciful scenarios -it's set in the year 2999 . And like The Simpsons , the show can devote an entire story to one character without breaking pace. Tonight the foul-tempered Bender joins the robot mafia, but is taken aback at his assignment: robbing his employers at Planet Express.
REALITY
Dating in the Dark
ABC, CITY-TV, 10 p.m.
Starting tonight, it's a new spin on Love Connection . Billed as a "sexy social experiment," the series format is a doozy: Three single men and three single women are placed in separate wings of a house. While forbidden from seeing each other in the light, the two groups are allowed to mingle in complete darkness; they can't see each other, but viewers can watch via infra-red cameras. Near the end of every episode, each participant will describe what they believe to be their dream-lover to a police sketch artist. And when everyone comes into the light, each person has to make the decision whether to pursue the romance, or move on. Ain't love grand?
TUESDAY july 21
BIOGRAPHY
Like Each Day Was Your Last: A Journey with
Justin Hines
Bravo!, 7 p.m.
The name Justine Hines may not sound familiar, but you know his voice. The 27-year-old singer from Newmarket, Ont., has recorded two albums that have received healthy radio airplay and recently sang There's No Place Like It in a TV commercial for Tourism Ontario. Hines suffers from a rare genetic joint condition called Larsen's syndrome, which keeps him wheelchair-bound. This program recounts Hines's career dating back to his first big break - singing the national anthem at a Toronto Raptors game - and follows him on his first international concert tour. He's a true inspiration.
REALITY
Hell's Kitchen
Fox, CITY-TV, 8 p.m.
The sixth edition of the reality cooking series has a Canadian connection: The top prize is the head chef position at the posh Araxi Restaurant in Whistler, B.C., just in time for the Olympic Winter Games. The two-hour premiere drops the 16 amateur chefs into chef Gordon Ramsay's gruelling culinary boot camp. In a slight rules tweak, the signature dish challenge will now be a team challenge, pitting men against women. But couldn't they have included at least one Canadian contestant?
DOCUMENTARY
Child Genius 2
TVO, 9 p.m.
A follow-up to the acclaimed program Child Genius , this sequel series tracks the progress of some very gifted kids. Each of the child prodigies is now 13 and each appears intent on impressing the world in his or her own unique way. The driven Aimee practises piano seven days a week and recently won a prestigious music competition. Home-schooled Michael is writing his fourth novel while simultaneously expanding his interests in ancient Greek and particle physics. And his friend Dante is far beyond his years in his comprehension of neuroscience.
COMEDY
Hope & Faith
CMT, 10 p.m.
Go ahead and laugh, but I like this show. First shown on ABC from 2003 to 2006, the low-key sitcom starred ex- Murphy Brown mainstay Faith Ford as Hope - a married homemaker with three kids - and Kelly Ripa as her sister Faith, a former soap-opera star whose character was bumped off. Both women are talented comic performers and their chemistry is augmented by simple sitcom scenarios. Tonight, country star Clint Black guest stars as Hope's former high-school beau who comes for a visit. Does Faith take a shine to the hunky cowpoke? You really don't have to ask, do you?
WEDNESDAY July 22
REALITY
Wipeout
ABC, CITY-TV, 8 p.m.
They say no one ever went broke underestimating the taste of the American viewing public, and here's your proof. A ratings success in its sophomore season, Wipeout puts foolhardy contestants through the world's largest extreme obstacle course. The show is promoted as some sort of ersatz athletic contest, but what really keeps viewers coming back are the face plants. Tonight, the players include a substitute schoolteacher and a clumsy chef, who compete in three decidedly non-Olympic events: the log roll, wedge turntables and fender benders. Be amazed and amused at how seriously the contestants take the competition.
HISTORY
Time Team America
PBS, 8 p.m.
Launched two weeks ago, this new series follows a team of scientists and historian into the trenches of intriguing archeological sites. Tonight, they travel to scenic New Philadelphia, Ill., to dig for the remains of the first American town founded by former slaves. Historical evidence reveals New Philadelphia was created by ex-slave "Free Frank" McWorter way back in 1836. The Time Team pulls out all stops to find remains of the pre-Civil War schoolhouse where African-American children learned to read and write in freedom.
REALITY
Toddlers and Tiaras
TLC, 10 p.m.
A surprise hit last January, this TLC reality series focuses on child-beauty-pageant contestants and their stage parents standing in the wings. The program airs sans narration, presumably to maintain objectivity, but most of the parents shown on the first season were extreme cases. The format holds in the second-season opener, which is filmed at the Universal
Royalty pageant in Austin, Tex., where roughly 100 young contestants elbow each other for the $1,000 top prize. The fan favourite: Cameron Fletcher-Cantu - already a pageant veteran at seven years of age - but the judges are also eyeing six-year-old fraternal twins BreAnne and AshLynn.
TALK SHOW
The Hour
CBC, 11 p.m.
A rebroadcast from last season features an engaging chat with TV and film veteran Garry Marshall. The Bronx-born Marshall is best known as the man who created Happy Days for television and the director of such big-screen hits as Pretty Woman and The Princess Diaries . He's also no slouch as an actor and recently appeared in the film remake of Escape from Witch Mountain and even provided a guest voice on a memorable episode of The Simpsons (he played a carny-type promoter named Larry Kidkill). Host George Stroumboulopoulos helms a lively chat with the Hollywood legend.
THURSDAY JULY 23
FOOD
Restaurant Makeover
Food Network, 8 p.m.
Imagine if you were allowed to make menu suggestions and improvements to your favourite restaurant - and they listened! Each outing in this popular Food Network series challenges two culinary hotshots to revamp a flagging eatery. In this episode, chef David Adjey and designer Glen Peloso are airlifted in to help a couple named Edward and Natasha, who are struggling with a restaurant called Jonathan's. The couple inherited the place from Natasha's father, along with all the usual headaches. Despite the prime location, the menu is a mish-mash and nobody's eating there. Adding more pressure: The couple are expecting their first child, and the baby fund is the only money available for renovation. Dare they take the risk?
COMEDY
Samantha Who?
ABC, 8:30 p.m.
ABC has officially pulled the plug on this offbeat sitcom after two rocky seasons. Launched in 2007, the show starred former Married ... with Children regular Christina Applegate as a woman who suffers a hit-and-run accident and comes out of a coma with retrograde amnesia; she was fully functional, but had no memories of her past. In the last show, Samantha's best pal Andrea (Jennifer Esposito) is set to marry a gay pro-basketball player. At the same time, Samantha has to choose between her ex-boyfriend Todd (Barry Watson) and the eccentric billionaire Winston Funk (Billy Zane). After this show, Samantha Who? goes straight to DVD.
DRAMA
Doc Martin
PBS, 8 p.m.
Devotees of this endearing British comedy-drama take note: Filming has already commenced on a fourth season, which will air early next year. For now, fans will have to be content with old episodes and love is in the air with tonight's outing. Dour Dr. Martin Ellingham (Martin Clunes) suddenly finds himself pursued by the glamorous hotel-owner Carrie Wilson (Louise Delamere) and the lovely Louisa (Caroline Catz). At least one of his admirers loses interest when Doc Martin runs over her dog.
MOVIE
Childstar
Bravo!, 9 p.m.
Canadian filmmaker Don McKellar held true to his indie-film roots with this breezy 2004 feature. McKellar directed and co-wrote the story and assigned himself the pivotal role of Rick, an aspiring documentarian reduced to working as a limo driver. Rick's life becomes chaos when he chauffeurs around a spoiled preteen TV star named Taylor (Mark Rendall), in Toronto to shoot his first movie. When Taylor runs away from the film set, Rick turns mentor and father figure. Worth watching for Alan Thicke as the young star's TV-sitcom father - a role not far removed from his old days on Growing Pains .

China's economic growth comes with risks

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/chinas-economic-growth-comes-with-risks/docview/382623724/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: The government is already trying to fine-tune its stimulus to reduce the risk of bubbles. As U.S. housing prices slide, China's are rising at a 10-per-cent annualized pace, fast enough for some to declare a new real-estate boom. The Shanghai stock market's benchmark index has gained 75 per cent this year, closing yesterday at a 13-month high on some of the heaviest trading since 2007.

Full text:   Sustainability of state-driven rebound will be critical for global recovery
China's economy has turned around with startling rapidity in recent months, with factory output, bank lending and commodity imports all accelerating on the back of the government's massive stimulus program. The next challenge for authorities is sustaining that growth and keeping emerging problems at bay while weaning the world's third-largest economy off state funding.
The sustainability of this state-driven growth spurt is a critical issue for the global economy. The success of China's massive stimulus has been a rare bright spot in the worst global downturn in a generation, with all advanced economies expected to contract this year. A lot rides on Beijing's ability to overcome a decline in exports, bolster its domestic economy, and avoid stirring a new bubble in the housing market.
"China will be among the first countries to lead the global economy out of this recession," said Hans Timmer, director of the World Bank's economic forecasting department. Developing countries such as China are becoming a bigger driver of global growth as U.S. households cut back consumption and boost savings, he said.
Economists estimate that China's economy likely expanded by close to 8 per cent from a year earlier in the second quarter, up from 6.1 per cent in the first quarter. The official figure is scheduled to be announced early today in Beijing.
When measured in the same terms as other major economies - an annualized quarter-on-quarter comparison - China's growth in the second quarter could be on the order of 15 per cent, some private economists estimate. Even if the surge moderates in coming quarters, many analysts say China will very nearly meet its target of 8 per cent growth for all of 2009.
China has rebounded after authorities used the state-controlled banking system to engineer one of the most dramatic monetary expansions in history. Banks have issued twice as much in new loans so far this year as in the first half of 2008, and China's money supply is now expanding at nearly triple the rate in the United States. The credit boost has helped to restore confidence, and the activity it supports is, at least in the short term, good news for home builders, car makers and suppliers of commodities like copper.
But the government's strategy also carries risks. The flood of easy money into the economy could be spilling over into markets for stocks and real estate, and inflating fresh bubbles. Any buildup in bad loans and dud projects could weigh down growth and public finances. Also, the economy's dependence on government-driven investment and credit mean that any policy hiccups could derail the pickup in confidence.
"I do think there is a distinct and rising risk of an asset bubble and fluctuation in growth," said Wang Tao, China economist for UBS. "In addition to short-term stimulus, there needs to be medium-term thinking about changing the growth model," Ms. Wang said.
The government is already trying to fine-tune its stimulus to reduce the risk of bubbles. As U.S. housing prices slide, China's are rising at a 10-per-cent annualized pace, fast enough for some to declare a new real-estate boom. The Shanghai stock market's benchmark index has gained 75 per cent this year, closing yesterday at a 13-month high on some of the heaviest trading since 2007. The record surge in China's official reserves of foreign currency, which hit $2.132-trillion (U.S.) in June, was driven partly by renewed inflows of capital from abroad chasing strong growth. Economists estimate such "hot money" totalled $30-billion to $50-billion in the second quarter.
At the same time, China must take longer-term costs into account. As other countries are doing with their stimulus efforts, China is borrowing from future growth to support the economy today. But the implicit debt the authorities are taking on by supporting bank loans and local government projects is several times larger than the official budget deficit of 3 per cent of gross domestic product this year. That will leave it less ammunition to stimulate the economy again - even as it becomes clear that lending and investment can't sustain their hectic pace.
Officials recognize that. "An improving trend in the economy does not mean that this difficult period is over," Premier Wen Jiabao told a meeting of economists and business people last week. China will continue stimulus policies while also undertaking structural reforms to support longer-term growth, he said.
One reason why officials are reluctant to start phasing out the stimulus is weak demand for China's exports, which are down 22 per cent so far this year. Despite official concern about unemployment, the small businesses that account for most jobs remain starved for credit even amid the boom. The benefits of the stimulus program have so far been concentrated in the state sector, which employs only about 20 per cent of the national work force.
"The current recovery is mainly based on a short-term rebound in inventories, which is not the same as a trend recovery," the State Information Center, an official think tank in Beijing, said in a report last week. "The material basis for an economic recovery would be the beginning of a new round of large-scale investment in capital equipment," the analysts said, urging Beijing to do more to support private-sector investment.
The best hope for a sustained investment boom may lie in China's strong housing market this year. Although home sales collapsed for much of last year, confidence started to return after the stimulus plan. Residential property sales were up 50 per cent in June alone. More importantly, developers have resumed building homes, encouraged by easy financing conditions and rising sales. The latest data show construction starts were up 12 per cent from a year earlier in June, marking the first increase after 11 straight months of decline.
Although slower than the 20-per-cent to 30-per-cent gains of recent years, the improvement is welcome, because construction drives demand for steel and many other industries, such as home appliances. If demand from the housing sector can keep Chinese factories humming, they will in turn be able to invest in expansion, which would drive economic growth.
Yesterday, U.S. Commerce Secretary Gary Locke reiterated Washington's argument that further liberalizing China's markets and allowing its currency to appreciate would help boost consumption.
"If China allowed for greater flexibility in its exchange rate and further opened up its domestic markets for imports and foreign direct investment, it would accelerate the world's return to growth," Mr. Locke said in Beijing.

Full text:   Only a short time ago, criticisms in Whistler over the 2010 Games were rarely heard and quickly silenced. Now, though, with taxes going up and up as if they were on the world's longest ski lift, angry questions are getting louder - and any answers are proving elusive
gmason@globeandmail.com
There was a time when the worries Linda McGaw had about her town's role in hosting the upcoming Winter Olympics were viewed with ridicule and contempt. She was one of a dozen residents who put their names to a letter to the editor a few years ago urging people to take a step back from the unabashed enthusiasm they were expressing for everything Olympics.
"The people who put their names to that letter were lambasted by the boosters in town," Ms. McGaw recalled this week over coffee. "They told us the Olympics could do nothing but good. All we were saying was, 'Nobody is asking hard questions here.' I lost a friendship over it. Some of us were verbally abused. Part of me would like to write a letter today that says, 'Well, what do you think now?' "
Just seven months before the Games open, the mood in Canada's famed resort town is anything but celebratory. In fact, there is growing anti-Olympic sentiment created by double-digit tax hikes and new user fees that residents feel are being levied to help pay for what many see as a three-week-long party.
Even the man who has been the focus of much of the anti-Olympic rhetoric, Whistler Mayor Ken Melamed, concedes that the town's normally laid-back residents have become a crabby, cantankerous lot. Partway through a discussion of the town's grievances, the mayor stopped and said, "You're starting to get the sense of why the community is feeling some frustration, and there's a lot of tension, I acknowledge that," he said. "We deal with it on an almost hourly basis."
The mayor is the town's biggest Olympic cheerleader, an irony not lost on long-time residents. Before ascending to the mayor's chair, Mr. Melamed was a councillor, the only one to vote against Whistler becoming part of a Games bid.
Each week, the editorial pages of the town's two weekly newspapers, The Whistler Question and The Pique, are filled with letters denouncing the mayor and council over decisions that residents, rightly or wrongly, have linked to the Games. The source of their grievances ranges from a proposed 20-per-cent property-tax hike over the next three years, to a decision to charge for parking in previously free lots.
Environmentalists were angry when a sensitive wetlands habitat became the chosen site for a new bus facility that will be used to accommodate a fleet of hydrogen buses Premier Gordon Campbell promised to showcase at the Games. Even the mayor admits an Olympic deadline forced a decision on the location that wasn't the best. Then, more trees had to come down near the town centre to build Celebration Plaza, where Olympic medals will be handed out.
More fury and indignation.
Few are happy either that the local high school will be closed for the 17-day duration of the Games - except those who have rented out their homes for big bucks and will be in Mexico or some other warm clime when the Olympics are on. (The schools won't be closed for the Paralympic portion of the Games.)
One of the mayor's fiercest critics is lawyer and former councillor Nancy Wilhelm-Morden. Her weekly column in the Whistler Question has become a platform for a relentless attack on local leaders over what she sees as decisions that could haunt the municipality for years.
"I'm mostly concerned about the amount of money that's being spent," she said in an interview in her Whistler office. "I'm concerned about what happens after the Olympics, when all the construction workers are finished the projects they're working on, and there are a million fewer skiers next season because of the economy, and we've spent a lot of our reserves from a municipal perspective."
Ms. Wilhelm-Morden said it is becoming increasingly expensive for the middle-to-low-income earners who make up the bulk of the resort's year-round population of nearly 10,000. "A lot of those people are starting to feel like they're being driven out of here," she said. "If that happens, it would be really tragic for Whistler, a real loss, because the people who live and work here are what make the place so special for visitors."
Lennox McNeely, philanthropist and retired investment analyst, is an eloquent letter-to-the-editor writer. Paying for parking won't affect his bank account, but he's worried about young families who don't have much disposable income, and are, in many ways, the lifeblood of the town.
"What bothers me the most is the total lack of concern for the financial squeeze residents are going through," Mr. McNeely said over dinner one night this week. "And also the lack of participation by the municipality and the municipal workers in any cutbacks. Meantime, the average income of most other people in town is off 10 to 15 per cent. And then they have the gall to spend thousands on Olympic jackets, I mean..."
Oh, yes, those jackets. We'll get to those in a minute.
Residents were upset that unionized municipal workers were awarded a raise of 12 per cent over three years that was agreed to by their municipal counterparts throughout Greater Vancouver. The mayor said he couldn't unilaterally cut back their wages, despite calls from Whistler citizens to do just that. Mr. Melamed took more grief when he voted in favour of a rate-of-inflation increase for himself and his fellow councillors.
"If we don't get that, we're taking a pay cut," he said. Which is precisely what many residents thought he and the council should have done.
But it's often the little things that become symbols of protest. And an announcement that the municipality was spending more than $37,000 to buy Olympic tickets for the use of city staff and others went over about as well as a drunk toastmaster at a wedding. But that was nothing compared to the wails over the decision to spend $38,000 to buy Olympic jackets for the 350 municipal workers.
"That was the last straw for a lot of people," said G.D. Maxwell, town iconoclast and a weekly columnist for The Pique. "They've been spending money on all sorts of things that are all about appearances. But what will allow people to have a good time here is not the lipstick on the pig, it's how long the pig's been smoked and how good it tastes. I think we're using a lot of lipstick that we don't need to use.
"People here were as hopping mad about those jackets as Americans were seeing auto executives riding to Washington in corporate jets begging for money."
Perhaps underlying the growing angst is the feeling that Whistler hasn't been calling many of the shots when it comes to its Olympic involvement. That it's become a town run by outsiders, namely the Vancouver Organizing Committee and the International Olympic Committee. A charge the mayor doesn't dispute.
"There's no question that is the reality," he said. "And I say to people who criticize that, 'I'm not sure it could have been any other way. Those are the terms of engagement when you put on an event like this.' "
Writer Michel Beaudry has been coming to Whistler to ski for more than 30 years. He said the recent real-estate boom and now the Olympics have changed the gestalt of the town. "Now people are saying, 'What's going on here?' " said Mr. Beaudry, still recovering from the shocking death of his wife, Wendy Ladner-Beaudry, murdered earlier this year while jogging in a park near the University of British Columbia. "The IOC doesn't have Whistler's best interests at heart. Whistler is just realizing now that it is just a satellite to Vancouver in all of this. ...
"The politicians in Whistler love to talk about sustainability, but it's a big joke because the Olympics have created these white elephants, like the ski jump and sliding centre that will never pay for themselves. Whistlerites are saying, 'I came here to simplify my life, now I'm paying more tax than I did in the big city.' "
Perhaps adding to the sense of foreboding is the rapid deterioration of the local economy. Hotel bookings are off significantly. The ski industry has been hard hit by the recession. Whistler faces an end to the rapid development that has boosted the economy for more than two decades.
To address funding shortfalls, civic leaders are wrestling with an ugly dilemma: continue to raise taxes, or allow the town to expand beyond the limits set out in its long-term sustainability plan. That, many fear, would imperil Whistler's one-of-a-kind, European-like resort experience.
Those sounding the alarm about the Olympics have one thing in common: an intense feeling of ownership and love of their town. But they are increasingly worried that the very things that attracted them to Whistler in the first place are slowly disappearing. They are feeling overwhelmed by the pace of change and under siege by the associated costs of the Olympics.
Even the mayor senses that.
"People are feeling the burden of: What's next?" the mayor said. "How many other things are coming down the pipe that we'll have to make a compromise on to support the Games? But my view is, in the end, most people will agree it will have been worth it."

Full text:   Oysterman Rodney Clark and developer Hans Jain find an environmentally friendly way to settle what could have been a nasty legal battle
daveleblanc@globeandmail.com
We've all heard of a "golden handshake." Now, thanks to environmental lawyer David Donnelly, Toronto has just witnessed its first green handshake, which may set a precedent for homeowners in older neighbourhoods facing the pressures of infill development.
Shaking hands are self-described "urban oysterman" Rodney Clark, a 17-year resident of east-end Kimberley Ave. and owner of Rodney's Oyster House on King St. West, and developer Hans Jain of Atria Development Corporation.
At issue is Mr. Jain's eight-unit townhouse development, near Main and Gerrard Streets. While seven of the units quietly snake behind the backyard fence of Mr. Clark's handsome century home, the sole detached unit comes within inches of Mr. Clark's quahog shell-covered driveway, and its tall, blank wall substitutes a good deal of his blue-sky view with unwanted shadows.
"He was shouting into the phone that he had just woken up to the sight of the Trump Tower screening out his sunlight," remembers Mr. Donnelly about the phone call he received from Mr. Clark, who had just come home from a lengthy business trip. "He likes to tell a good story so I thought he was either pulling my leg or he'd switched up his medication."
Since Mr. Clark was an old friend - the two know each other through mutual participation in the Ontario Oyster Festival and its support of the advocacy group Environmental Defence - Mr. Donnelly drove over and had a look. While Mr. Donnelly was aware that Atria had purchased the lot with development approvals already in place and, further, that Mr. Clark and his neighbours had fought the previous developer to reduce the scale and impact of the infill project, he was still "quite surprised" at the size of the one detached house: "It really does dominate that part of the street and certainly overshadows a good part of Rodney's property."
So, after calming Mr. Clark down, he arranged a meeting with Mr. Jain. His expectations for a resolution were high, since he'd had past dealings with the Jain family and found them to be "first-class developers." However, since Ontario does not have "right to light" legislation, which exists in some American states and the United Kingdom, he knew his friend would be "out of luck in terms of the traditional planning tools to force some kind of compliance on Mr. Jain."
In other words, the three men would have to find a more creative solution.
Mr. Clark did have a small bargaining chip. In order to finish masonry and roofing work, Mr. Jain would need to rent Mr. Clark's driveway to erect scaffolding. But, instead of a simple cash payout, Mr. Donnelly suggested that Atria install a solar-thermal unit on Mr. Clark's roof so he could "capture what's left of his sunlight and turn it into green energy," says the lawyer. That way, "every time Rodney takes a shower or does his dishes he can think, 'You know, there's something positive that has come out of this experience about being impacted by infill development.' "
"It's not as bad as lobster fishermen getting a poor catch and getting a subsidy from the Minister of Fisheries," adds Mr. Clark, "and it's not that everyone should be at the front door receiving a cheque - it's that [Atria is] changing the design of the community, therefore they have to put something back into it."
Mr. Jain agrees: "We have to work with our neighbours, and [Mr. Clark] seemed like a reasonable guy; we could have had a long and protracted discourse with lawyers and all of that on a really adversarial basis but, I think, on both our sides it doesn't pay."
In addition to the solar panel, Mr. Jain agreed to hire a local landscape architect to soften the tall, blank wall with plantings. And he's decided to incorporate more sustainable features into future projects: "You want to do better for your children," he says, simply.
After the green handshake, Mr. Donnelly drew up a formal contract, which he hopes will serve as a model for future homeowners in similar situations. Until, that is, the province passes its own right-to-light legislation: "It's the next big battleground on the road to Ontario's sustainable energy future."
It is legislation Mr. Donnelly would be happy to help prepare in order to protect both the homeowner and their sunlight but also allow people to develop more intensively in urban areas. "We have [older and underutilized] two-storey buildings along a subway line, so we have a long way to go," he says. "The [city's official] target is a half-million people in downtown Toronto, in my opinion it should be a million or more and there's only one way to go and that's up."
And, just like an oyster covering an unwanted irritant to form a pearl, so too has Mr. Clark turned what could have been an irritating real estate situation into something much more palatable: "There has to be in the community stewardship, sustainability and some realization that we all have to fish off the same wharf."

Full text:   More condos move in May as builders rejig their sales techniques
tbelford@globeandmail.com
The new condo market continued to mimic the little engine that could in May. It puffed its way in an I-think-I-can, I-think-I-can rhythm to total monthly sales of 881 units.
The downside is that sales were just over half of the 1,531 suites sold in May last year. The upside is that May was better than April's 551 sales and March's 414.
Interestingly as the new condo market continued to languish, new single-family home sales boomed in May, says George Carras, president of RealNet Canada Inc., which tracks the GTA residential market.
He says May single family sales stood at 1,708 homes, a significant jump from the 1,563 sold in May last year.
How come? No easily identifiable single reason, he says.
"It may be that people are skeptical about what the immediate future holds for condos," he says. "It may be pent-up demand from first-time buyers either raising or about to raise a family. Coming months may provide an explanation."
It stands to reason that if first time buyers, young singles or couples are the main force driving the condo market, then the next iteration of that group, those looking to start a family or those tired of trying to raise children within the confines of a condo, are snapping up houses.
A hint of that may be seen in the condo resale market, which is buoyant. Those who made a condominium their entry level into home ownership now find they can sell, take their profit, line up a low interest mortgage, put that profit toward the new house as a down payment and run off to suburbia.
So where does that leave new condo builders? That again is interesting. The new condo scene is not all doom and gloom and anxious developers wringing their hands over lack of buyer interest.
There are indeed some projects doing land rush business, Mr. Carras points out. As mentioned in a previous column, Fly on Front Street West between Spadina Avenue and Blue Jays Way moved 221 units in May thanks to redesigned, smaller and less expensive suites.
Another big winner was Evolution, a 13-storey, 133-suite project in the Dundas Street West and Islington area. A relaunch by builder Beaverbrook Homes May 28 saw agents, brokers, investors and ordinary buyers snap up 88 suites in a weekend. The original launch was spring of 2008 and by last fall when the bottom fell out of the market, Beaverbrook had sold about 30 units.
"In effect we sold all the suites the builder released to us," says Debbie Cosic of In2ition Realty Corp., sales agent for Evolution.
Yes there was the usual 20 per cent in rescissions but by late June her team had still managed to sign 76 firm deals.
"The builder is delighted," she says. "He can now get his construction financing and put all the worries of the late fall and winter behind him."
Ms. Cosic and In2ition are on a roll. This is their sixth relaunch so far this year.
"We've become something of experts," she says. "All of them have proved successful."
The secret, she says, is in persuading builders to redesign projects to meet the needs of younger, first time buyers, use those redesigns to drop prices significantly, and then create an incentive package that saves buyers even more money.
At Evolution, Beaverbrook turned two-bedroom suites into singles and one-plus-dens. It got the price of its smallest suite - a 500-plus-square-foot one-bedroom - down to $169,900. Then, on the relaunch weekend offered $10,000 off suites if buyers would cough up the full 20-per-cent down payment. To make it easy, Beaverbrook offered terms: 5 per cent within 30 days of signing the purchase agreement, 5 per cent at 120 days, 5 per cent at 360 days and the final 5 per cent 30 days before closing.
Buyers could still purchase with 10 per cent down, but they would have to pay full freight. To sweeten the deal, buyers got to choose from one of three additional incentives: A suite full of furniture from the House of Teak; a year free of maintenance payments and for investors who planned to rent out their suite, a year's guaranteed rents at market rates.
"We focused on agents and brokers and on the local community, which is Eastern European and Korean in large part. We staged special events for each group," says Ms. Cosic. "Investors were especially interested because the prices were low enough so that rental income would cover mortgages and monthly maintenance," she adds.
"The upshot was we were able to sell everything the builder released to us."
Builders have to accept that times have indeed changed, Ms. Cosic says. The old philosophy of "if we build it, someone will buy it" is now out the window.
"The ones that are doing well today are the ones that understand their buying market and create a product that offers such value that it is hard to say no," she says.

Full text:   Insiders plead for help, warning Washington of crash worse than 1990s slump that could saddle banks with new wave of bad loans
A looming crisis in commercial real estate looks like the next big headache for recession-weary Americans.
Real estate insiders, experts and regulators warned a U.S. congressional committee yesterday that commercial real estate is headed for a crash that could eclipse even the devastating slump of the early 1990s, saddling already hobbled banks with a new wave of bad loans.
The picture isn't pretty. Property values have already collapsed more than home prices, vacancy rates are soaring as the recession wears on and once-buoyant loan and credit markets have virtually dried up. Now, even the owners of good properties are facing foreclosure.
"Commercial real estate is the next shoe to drop," James Helsel, a Pennsylvania realtor and treasurer of the U.S. National Association of Realtors, told the joint economic committee.
The hearing comes as the Obama administration is investigating what to do about emerging risks facing the U.S. economy - a process ominously dubbed "Plan C" to signify a last line of defence. And the plight of commercial real estate is near the top of its concerns.
The dilemma for the U.S. Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department is that they do not want to expose the banking system to any new risks. But unless banks resume steady lending to commercial real estate, the industry says the job market and local tax revenues could take another big hit. There aren't any easy answers.
But industry officials told the committee that better tax treatment of foreign investors would go a long way to help.
They also called for a degree of mortgage relief from banks, and improved government efforts to revive the lifeless mortgage-backed securities market.
"We need to turn the page and get the market working again," said Jeffrey DeBoer, president and chief executive of the Real Estate Roundtable, which represents large developers and property managers.
The epicentre of the commercial real estate crisis is New York, where nearly $8-billion (U.S.) worth of commercial properties - mainly office towers - are in various stages of financial distress.
But Manhattan isn't the only problem market. A growing number of properties are in trouble in several other major cities, including Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Detroit, Phoenix, Chicago, Dallas and Boston, real estate agents said.
And the crisis is only just beginning. A wave of loans made during the boom years of the past decade are now coming due, including roughly $400-billion (U.S.) worth this year and more than $1.8-trillion by 2012, according to the Washington-based Real Estate Roundtable.
With prices falling rapidly, banks are balking at refinancing all that debt. And the mortgage-backed securities market has ground to a halt.
"The severity of the current downturn is likely to exceed, possibly by a large magnitude, [the crash] of the early 1990s," Deutsche Bank real estate analyst Richard Parkus told the committee.
In April, the refinancing impasse forced Chicago-based General Growth Properties, the second-largest U.S. shopping mall owner, into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. With rental revenue falling and vacancies rising, General Growth's lenders refused to refinance its $27-billion in debts.
Prices for office towers and shopping centres are already down 35 to 45 per cent from their peak in 2007, and further declines are likely, Mr. Parkus said. That compares with a 32 per cent peak-to-trough decline for house prices, according to the Case-Shiller home price index.
Many office towers with significant vacancies, in Manhattan and elsewhere, are being unloaded at "fire sale" discounts of up to 70 per cent.
In an environment of rapidly falling prices, banks are leery about renewing loans because they don't know what properties are really worth, noted Mr. DeBoer of the Real Estate Roundtable. "It's like asking the banks to catch a falling knife."
The industry is pushing the Fed to help out by loosening up the terms of its $1-trillion Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility (TALF), which was recently extended to cover commercial mortgage-backed securities.
But Mr. DeBoer said there are few takers because the rates are too expensive and the program is set to expire at the end of the year.
This all spells looming trouble for banks. The banking industry, which has a $1.8-trillion exposure to commercial real estate, could face losses of nearly $200-billion, according to Mr. Parkus.
And unlike the housing meltdown, this crisis is likely to hit smaller banks the hardest. Mr. Parkus pointed out that the four largest U.S. banks have an average exposure of 2 per cent to commercial real estate. The 30 to 100 largest banks have an average 12-per-cent exposure.
"We see [commercial real estate] as a very significant risk," acknowledged Jon Greenlee, the Fed's associate director of bank supervision and regulation.
He pointed out that the 19 large financial institutions that recently underwent stress tests had roughly $600-billion in commercial real estate loans. The total market is worth $3.5-trillion.
There were 5,315 U.S. commercial properties in default, foreclosure or bankruptcy at the end of June, more than twice the number at the end of 2008, with hotels and retail among the most "problematic," Real Capital Analytics Inc. said in a report yesterday.

Full text:   Planned expansion is renewing interest in industrial lands, and developers are fretting over future availability
Container shipments from Asia are sagging as North America's consumers retrench, but in the Vancouver suburb of Delta plans are afoot for a $4.25-billion expansion of port capacity that will ensure the region's status as one of the West Coast's premier Pacific gateways.
The anticipated increase in container capacity promises to create opportunities for owners and developers of industrial land.
"Owners of industrial property are in a very good position these days," said Tom Winkler, chief strategic development officer for Port Metro Vancouver, the entity formed in January, 2008, with the amalgamation of the Fraser River, North Fraser and Vancouver port authorities.
Port Metro Vancouver's facilities anchor the region's industrial landscape, from Delta in the south to North Vancouver and east to New Westminster and Port Moody. Owners of warehousing and logistics space, where imports are received for distribution locally and across the country, stand to be among the beneficiaries when the port completes a major expansion of the Deltaport container terminal later this year, boosting the terminal's capacity to 1.8 million TEUs (20-foot equivalent units, the standard measurement of container volumes).
Port Metro Vancouver is also planning a new, $2-billion container terminal adjacent to Deltaport to complement the existing terminal, doubling capacity and requiring upward of 250 acres for container storage and handling.
It all sounds a tad ambitious these days, given that the port handled just 114.6 million tonnes of cargo last year, down 10 per cent from 2007. The port forecasts an additional 10- to 15-per-cent drop in cargo volumes this year.
But the setback is widely regarded as temporary, with the port forecasting growth of 3.5 to 4.5 per cent a year between 2010 and 2013. The healthiest segment of the port's business - and also the one the port has been most eager to expand - is container traffic. Representing approximately a sixth of all cargo traffic, container volumes totalled 20.5 million tonnes in 2008, just 3 per cent less than in 2007.
Since up to 45 per cent of containers arriving in Vancouver are reorganized and distributed locally (the rest flows through the region to other parts of the continent), any increase spells good news for owners of industrial property.
"That's what creates demand for industrial land," Mr. Winkler said.
It's a welcome change from recent years. On the one hand, industrial growth was hemmed in by the province's 36-year-old Agricultural Land Reserve that limits development. On the other, rising land values saw many industrial sites rezoned for more lucrative types of development. The region lost hundreds of acres of industrial land to home builders during the province's recent real estate boom, many of them in prime waterfront locations.
The competition for sites won't stop, Mr. Winkler said, but port expansion is renewing interest in industrial opportunities among developers.
But securing enough industrial land to serve future needs is going to be a challenge, he said. The port itself needs approximately 50 acres adjacent to the third berth currently under construction at Deltaport, and 250 acres to handle container shipments as part of the new container terminal. Regionally, a study for the province last year found that 2,700 acres of land are required to support port capacity over the next 20 to 25 years. These sites have to be large enough to handle traffic volumes, have adequate servicing and be close to transportation infrastructure - both highways and airports.
There's just one hitch.
"There's probably only approximately 600 acres of suitable industrial land," Mr. Winkler said. To protect its interests, the port has started buying up available properties. It recently closed a $47.5-million deal for a 56-acre parcel on the Fraser River in New Westminster that was previously home to a Canfor Corp. fibre and panel mill. It will be leased to a construction company pending development for port uses. It has also secured a 50-acre mill site with a kilometre of river frontage from International Forest Products Ltd. for $30.1-million.
Buying now is a wise strategy for the port, as Mr. Winkler believes the port's demand for land will "create additional price pressures" over the long term. Rising prices are difficult to imagine in the current market, however. Metro Vancouver industrial properties are seeing slack demand and price declines after surging to more than $1-million an acre in some locales.
Meanwhile, the Vancouver office of CB Richard Ellis reports that 1.2 million square feet of industrial space returned to the market in the first quarter of 2009 - the single biggest quarterly return of space in the 11 years CB Richard Ellis has been tracking the local industrial market. While vacancies sit at 3.3 per cent, the actual proportion of space available for sale or lease is a much-higher 5.9 per cent.
The shift in fortunes has local brokers such as Ron Emerson, president of the Emerson Real Estate Group Inc. in Vancouver, less optimistic about the market's prospects in the short to medium term.
"I think the demand factor has really dropped off. And it's probably going to stay that way for the next little while," Mr. Emerson said. "Our market won't collapse completely, but it's going to get very difficult for a minimum of 12 months, I think." Development at the port will be a driver of opportunities when the market rebounds, but the short-term troubles highlight how much of the port's fortunes - and in turn, those of local industrial properties - are dependent on macroeconomic trends.
When demand does pick up, however, the movement of goods through the port will restore demand for sites.

Full text:   My mother always felt she missed out on the footloose 1960s, already roped in to rearing a family in the suburbs of Toronto when Bob Dylan, the Beatles and the Mamas and the Papas issued their siren calls from the radio. The opportunities to spend a summer of love in San Francisco were limited, but the music of the times made her dream of California.
And so I brought great, inherited expectations with me on my first trip to San Francisco in the late 1980s. I was visiting a friend in a modern place perched near the top of Telegraph Hill. From the window, I could see the dozens of ferries and container ships traversing the Golden Gate, the strait connecting the Pacific and the San Francisco Bay, and hear a flock of kelly-green parrots squawk companionably in the eucalyptus trees atop the hill.
I set out to find the city that inspired so many of my heroes to sing and write so intensely, from the Japanese Tea Garden in Golden Gate Park, to a nude beach down the dramatic coast and to the centre of the 1960s counterculture, Haight-Ashbury.
Whatever I was looking for wasn't in the Haight, where a punk wearing a swastika T-shirt harassed passersby. Everything tawdry about the sixties seemed to linger there - the grunge, drugs and political faddism - but little of the period's noble ideals, apart from the still extant free clinic. Mainly, people came here to shop for shoes. "Want a buzz, sir?" a drug dealer asked me.
I loved the "sir" part.
In the end, I found some of the freewheeling spirit I was seeking just down the hill from my temporary residence, in North Beach - an old Italian district overrun by raffish Bohemians from the 1950s on. The cafes were filled with people of all ages apparently writing their life stories in thick journals. Live soul and blues pulsed from the smoky bars. The locals lounged in the parks, seeming to have nowhere to go, no one to see.
I returned to North Beach with trepidation when I moved to the Bay Area last year. Would it have been spoiled, a Starbucks on every other block?
Somehow, the essence of the neighbourhood has survived intact, although real-estate prices nearby have skyrocketed. It's sleepier, but none the less pleasant for that. Its activist citizens have kept the chain stores out, and the artists and poets - Lord knows where they're living - still play a central role in the community.
A walk through North Beach and up to the hilltop remains a particularly San Francisco treat. At the edge of North Beach at the border with touristy Chinatown is one of the world's great bookstores, City Lights. It was founded in 1953 by poet Lawrence Ferlinghetti, who was arrested for obscenity after he published Allen Ginsberg's epochal Howl in 1956. Its perspective, set out in its most famous passage, anticipated what was to come in the sixties: "I saw the best minds of my generation destroyed by madness, starving hysterical naked,/ dragging themselves through the negro streets at dawn looking for an angry fix./ Angel-headed
hipsters burning for the ancient heavenly connection/ to the starry dynamo in the machinery of night."
The calmest of what became known as the beat generation, Ferlinghetti (who is still living) was acquitted in the much publicized trial, and, in its wake, disaffected youth from around the nation flocked to San Francisco, to North Beach. As often as not, readings at City Lights are still happenings, filled with wonky San Franciscans as intent on giving voice to their own issues as listening to the author.
An appropriately ramshackle museum to the beats sits around the corner among strip joints that are remnants of the glory days of the city's famously permissive Barbary Coast. A huge mural at North Beach's main intersection, Columbus and Broadway, pays tribute to the jazz musicians who provided the soundtrack to these writers' frequent binges.
The congenial site of some of these binges, Vesuvio, is across an alleyway from the bookstore, and continues to draw a decent local crowd. Although every wall is busy, covered with remembrances of times past, there's a calm easiness to the place. On my visit, a ranting man, evidently homeless, comes in - the barman, himself a member of a jazz trio, mixes the man a lemon cordial and water, and talks him out of his funk. Two older clients, sitting in the window, carry on a muted intellectual conversation over a chess game.
A block away on the nicest little street in the neighbourhood, Grant Avenue, is Caffe Trieste, where, on the day I stop by, a construction worker, a dot-commer, a lawyer and a woman who has biked in from Sausalito line up to grab their lattes. Pictures on the wall show the Caffe's Italian founder with a moray eel hanging limp around his neck, his son's foray into motocross racing, his wife singing with an accordion, his meeting with local hero Francis Ford Coppola. (The film director's offices and wine bar, Cafe Zoetrope, occupy a picturesque nearby flatiron building.) A poet in a green beret approaches me once I crack open a journal and invites me to a reading. Overheard: "I know there's fraternité and liberté, but what was the third?"
Farther along the street are some old joints I remember - the Savoy Tivoli, still rocking with live music most nights, a down-at-the-heels laundromat, a vintage clothing store, the Italian-French bakery, and a soufflé café run by a redoubtable Frenchwoman who gave the place her name, Jacqueline. There are also some mainly welcome, newish additions: the inevitable yoga studio; a superb card shop, Lola's of North Beach; the area's most vital art gallery, Live Worms, and a vinyl record store.
A left turn brings on Washington Square, which with typical San Francisco perversity has a statue of Benjamin Franklin in its centre. Less perverse is the inscription, "Welcome" printed at the pedestal's base - a cheery message I took personally on my first visit. Towering above the square is what Ferlinghetti called the Marzipan church - St. Peter and Paul's white marble takes on the aspect of translucent marzipan in the late afternoon sun. The sizable Italian community still worships here, and funerals and weddings often spill out the doors. Angels and winged creatures enliven the statuary, and a quote (in Italian) from Dante about the splendour of God is spelled out across the façade. On the square are an airy brunch place, Mama's, with six different kinds of French toast, and a classic hat shop, Goorin Bros. And, as they did decades ago, people still practise tai chi here in the mornings.
Up, up, up the hill, with its cars parked sideways to the slope and its pastel clapboard houses, still somehow vertical, the fluted deco Coit Tower beckons. Past a schoolyard resounding at recess with the yells of its rambunctious, multicultural student body; through a park filled with typical California plants - bottlebrush trees, wild fennel and manzanitas, with their curiously muscular limbs. On to the summit. The city's two extraordinary suspension bridges, the Bay Bridge and Golden Gate, are both visible. Inside the tower are murals done by various artists in the Great Depression, funded by the Works Projects Administration. They show a lost America, with all manner and class of individual from hat-sporting tycoons to uniform-wearing waitresses and dungaree-clad grape pickers.
Out the front door is Alcatraz, looming out of the mist. And where are the parrots? I'm disappointed when they don't appear. But when I descend, I hear their inimitable squawks and see their green forms streaking across the sky. It's a different sort of happiness now, less obvious, less giddy, not always appearing quite on cue, but, for that reason, particularly welcome when it finally shows up.

Abstract: How could anyone not love these two? Terribly Scottish interior designers Colin McAllister and Justin Ryan are soulmates (they wed legally in London last year) and their natural ease with each other comes across on camera. For some reason it's adorable to watch real married people bicker. The duo were already huge TV stars in the United Kingdom before this Canadian series, which in turn has aired all over the world.

MINISERIES
Taken
Space, 8 p.m.This miniseries was a major TV event back in 2002. Well, for sci-fi fans anyway. Winner of that year's outstanding miniseries Emmy, the 10-part film was executive-produced by Steven Spielberg, who brought big-screen production values. Filmed in Vancouver, the story involves the reappearance of a horde of extraterrestrial abductees, some from centuries ago, paralleled with the usual X-Files plotline about a government cover-up of alien existence. Tonight's third chapter brings back John F. Kennedy, or a pretty good look-alike, who tries to quash the conspiracy known as The Project in 1962.
ANIMATED
The Goode Family
ABC, 8:30 p.m.
Come now, give the Goode Family a break. The follow-up series from King of the Hill creator Mike Judge has been soundly slammed by reviewers (The Globe's Lynn Crosbie wrote an entire essay damning the show) and has been a low finisher in U.S. ratings. Hence, the new timeslot on Friday night, where TV shows go to die. Did Judge miss his mark in this animated profile of an average family trying desperately hard to stay politically correct in Obama-age America? Maybe, but The Goode Family has sharper writing than most sitcoms, and interesting guest voices. Tonight, Elvis Costello plays an Oxford professor who pronounces earth mother Helen Goode as a world-class urban artist - with a spray can. DRAMA
Mental
Fox, Global, 9 p.m.Also new to Friday night, for pretty much the same reasons, Mental is a slick medical drama. But it ain't no House . The problem might have been the decision to cast the completely unknown Chris Vance in the lead role of Dr. Jack Gallagher, a handsome renegade shrink improbably put in charge of a hospital mental-health unit; he's good-looking, sure, but with no House gravitas. The writing on Mental is still fine, and tonight's show guest stars Willie Garson (Carrie's gay amigo on Sex and the City ) as a gambling addict on a ledge, literally.
SCIENCE
Secrets of the Dinosaur Mummy
Discovery, 10 p.m.
Is there anything more exciting than watching men in lab coats analyze dinosaur bones? Not in my book. This program follows the fantastically detailed autopsy of a young Brachylophosaurus that roamed the earth roughly 77-million years ago. The fun part is watching the scientists and art-imaging experts get giddy over the remarkably well-preserved remains. The science guys create a computer version of the dino, estimated to weigh 2,000 pounds, and are even able to determine the great beastie's last meal, just like on CSI .

Colin & Justin's Home Heist
HGTV, 7 p.m.
How could anyone not love these two? Terribly Scottish interior designers Colin McAllister and Justin Ryan are soulmates (they wed legally in London last year) and their natural ease with each other comes across on camera. For some reason it's adorable to watch real married people bicker. The duo were already huge TV stars in the United Kingdom before this Canadian series, which in turn has aired all over the world. On this evening's makeover mission, Colin and Justin take on the challenge of Teddy, a diminutive rock-'n'-roller whose tiny house has all the personality of an airport hotel room. Watch Teddy's face at the big reveal.
DOCUMENTARY
Crime Stories
History, 8 p.m.
The sturdy true-crime series rewinds the case of the Sacramento Slayer. Newspapers bestowed the name on Howard Morris Solomon Jr., a Sacramento handyman who claimed seven female victims in and around the Oak Park neighbourhood of Sacramento back in the mid-eighties. Some of the victims were prostitutes and an old solicitation charge brought Solomon's name to police attention.
COMEDY
Drew Hastings:
Irked and Miffed
Comedy, 10 p.m.
Here's one to watch: Drew Hastings is shockingly tall - six-foot-six, by his measure - well-dressed and very funny. In this Comedy Central special taped last year, Hastings is more a monologist than a comedian, sort of a metrosexual Spalding Gray. None of his diatribes have a punchline; they're just stories about things that happened to him. Covering a wide range of topics, Hastings riffs on his former life in L.A., his brief stint as a farmer in Missouri and briefer time spent with a girlfriend who was into erotic asphyxiation.
SUNDAY JULY 5
REALITY
The Janice Dickinson
Modeling Agency
Slice, 8 p.m.
For those viewers familiar with Janice Dickinson only through her recent appearance on I'm A Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! , this show presents a more telling display of her real character. A former model better known for her off-runway dalliances with Sylvester Stallone, Mick Jagger and others, Dickinson is host and overseer on this bizarre reality series. The format is more or less identical to every other model-search program on television: A gaggle of willowy, underfed young women are scrutinized by Dickinson and a panel of fashionistas, and then put through a series of challenges. Watch tonight as Dickinson reacts to some moralistic models who object to a photo shoot.
COMEDY
King of the Hill
Fox, Global, 8:30 p.m.
King of the Hill was one of the best reasons to watch TV on Sunday night, but creator Mike Judge ended the series last spring after 13 memorable seasons. The star of the show was always Hank Hill, a laconic, everyman Texan of slow wit but good heart. In tonight's show from last season, Hank receives a special-delivery box containing the belongings of his recently deceased father, Cotton - another great King of the Hill character. The box holds Cotton's war medals and a cassette tape dictating his final wishes. The wishes include a request that Hank smack the posterior of a brunette nurse at the veterans' hospital. Does Hank follow through on his dear daddy's wishes? Yup.
MYSTERY
Masterpiece Mystery:
Miss Marple
PBS, 9 p.m.
Welcome back, Miss Marple. The fine British actress Julia McKenzie assumes the role of Agatha Christie's spinster sleuth. A Pocket Full of Rye is the first of four upcoming Marple movies and opens with a typically provocative setup: Wealthy businessman Rex Fortescue has perished by poisoning. The case pulls in Miss Marple when her former maid, Gladys, turns up strangled on the Fortescue estate, with a clothespin clipped on her nose. The clues steer Miss Marple toward a childhood nursery rhyme, and also indicate more victims will come.
MONDAY JULY 6
DRAMA
House
Fox, Global, 8 p.m.
People try to find life balance in tonight's rebroadcast from last year. Tightly wound Dr. Gregory House (Hugh Laurie) is handed the case of a woman who blacked out during a cooking class. The woman was formerly a world-class cancer researcher who retired to find personal happiness. The case forces the members of House's diagnostic team to re-examine their slavish devotion to work, particularly when team member Thirteen (Olivia Wilde) begins to suffer life-threatening reactions to her experimental treatment for Huntington's disease.
CRIME DRAMA
Midsomer Murders
TVO, 9 p.m.
One of the best import crime dramas in recent years, Midsomer Murders is set in the fictional English county of Midsomer, where bodies seem to pop up with alarming frequency. The show's central character is sombre Detective Chief Inspector Tom Barnaby, played by John Nettles, who tackles each new homicide with weary aplomb. Tonight's show concludes a two-parter taking place during the town's annual Oak Apple Week festival. A body has been found floating in a stream. What appears to be a suicide is anything but, and the great detective butts heads with the bossy organizer of the event, who demands the celebrations carry on. Not on Barnaby's watch.
HISTORY
The Great Escape:
The Canadian Story
History, 9 p.m.
Everybody has seen the true-life adventure depicted in the 1963 film The Great Escape . Not many people know that Canadians played a major part in the story. This film recalls the efforts of young Canadians heroes who were integral to the Nazi prison-camp breakout, which occurred in March, 1944. Roughly 150 Canadians played a role in the escape, most notably Chatham, Ont., native Wally Floody, the RCAF lieutenant put in charge of building the labyrinth of tunnels. The escape was an incredibly complex operation, two years in the planning. Some Canadians made it out, but more paid the ultimate price.
DESIGN
Holmes on Homes
HGTV, 11 p.m.
Handyman Mike Holmes opens his big heart in one of the more touching episodes in the series. The episode focuses on a young couple named Jim and Alison. One month after buying their new home, they discovered Alison was pregnant with triplets. One of the girls was born with cerebral palsy, which meant the house would require special-needs renovations. The job to make their home wheelchair-accessible was a half-finished nightmare when the real tragedy occurred: Annie passed away, which left the parents shattered and their house in a shambles. Holmes's mission begins with undoing the shabby work of the previous contractor.
TUESDAY JULY 7
REALITY
Great American Road Trip
NBC, 8 p.m.
Launching tonight, this new reality series follows seven families on a summer road tour. Throwing caution and gas prices to the wind, the families are put in shiny new SUVS for the cross-country trek, with various challenges along the way. One family is knocked off each week and the last clan standing receives $100,000. Only in America.
CRIME DRAMA
NCIS
CBS, Global, 8 p.m.
The NCIS support character of Dr. Donald "Ducky" Mallard - played by former Man from U.N.C.L.E. star David McCallum - takes the spotlight in tonight's episode. In a shocking turn of events, Ducky is doing his job at a crime scene when he's stabbed by an unseen assailant. Stargate: Atlantis regular Torri Higginson guest stars, reprising her role of Dr. Jordan Hampton.
REALITY
Destroyed in Seconds
Discovery, 9 p.m.
Destroyed in Seconds is explained fully by its title: The entire show is about things being obliterated, very quickly. The real-life video and news footage is occasionally tarted up with sound effects, but all of the disasters on the series really happened. On tonight's show, a trailer-truck crash sends tons of lemons cascading over a bridge; a massive landslide engulfs dozens of homes; and spectators at an air show are horrified by the crash of a cargo plane. On reality TV, that's entertainment.
REALITY
The Little Couple
TLC, 10 p.m
A pleasant departure from TLC's current family reality shows - yes, we're talking about Jon & Kate Plus 8 - this series has the benefit of having seemingly decent people as subjects. Newlyweds Bill Klein (a sales rep) and Jen Arnold (a pediatrician) are both well under four feet tall. First featured on the program Little People, Big World , they are a remarkably normal couple, and the show takes a low-key approach in following their new lives together. In the first of two shows tonight, they depart on their first vacation together in Hawaii, where Bill becomes a little too competitive on the golf course. In the second show, they decide to buy their first house, but Jen wants a place in the city, while Bill desires a rambling house in the suburbs. Like most couples, the Little Couple work it out.
WEDNESDAY JULY 8
REALITY
At the End of My Leash
Slice, 8 p.m.
Four episodes of the canine-training series air back-to-back on a slow Wednesday evening. In the first, host Brad Pattison provides a reality-check for Kathy, a woman who can't stop taking in stray dogs, and her house now resembles a pound. Next, he bullies a couple whose Malamute has her terrified and him amused. Then it's three roommates with tiny yappy pooches, followed by a visit to a household in which the lazy kids have forgotten they ever owned a dog. Pattison dispenses tough love and it works.
INTERVIEW
The O'Regan Files
Bravo!, 8:30 p.m.
Last week, host Seamus O'Regan sat down with Liberal Party Leader Michael Ignatieff in this well-regarded interview series for a lively chat on all things Canadian. Tonight he's with music icon Randy Bachman, who co-founded the seminal sixties group the Guess Who and later created his own hard-rock niche with the group Bachman Turner Overdrive. Bachman reveals his song-writing technique, the science of which may greatly surprise some viewers.
COMEDY
Krod Mandoon and the Flaming Sword of Fire
CITY-TV, 10 p.m.
First shown on Comedy Central in the U.S., this swashbuckling parody recalls the long-departed TV era of Xena: Warrior Princess . Set in a fantasy realm of long ago, the series follows a reluctant and oft-cowardly hero named Krod (spell it backwards). Krod is usually trying to avoid confrontations with his sworn enemy, the evil ruler known as Chancellor Dongalor, played by Matt Lucas of Little Britain fame. For eye-candy purposes, the cast includes India de Beaufort as the pagan princess Aneka. She begins the series as Krod's girlfriend, but he backs off from her aggressive sexual behaviour. Also, she's capable of beating him up. Not much happens in any average episode - in the first show, Krod reluctantly raids Dongalor's castle to free some prisoners, but loses interest midway - but there is sharp writing and the scenery (the show was filmed in locations all over Hungary) makes it time well spent.
CRIME DRAMA
CSI: NY
CBS, CTV, 10 p.m.
For some viewers, the New York edition remains the show to watch in the CSI franchise - possibly because New York is a more interesting city than Las Vegas or Miami. By now, of course, the city is a full character in the forensic drama starring former film fixture Gary Sinise as crime-lab boss Mac Taylor. Tonight's show should probably not be watched after eating: A high-school wrestling coach has been dismembered and his body parts are being found all over the city. The task of piecing together the human jigsaw falls to Mac and his CSI team. In the secondary plot, Detective Flack is grilled by Internal Affairs when a teenaged suspect dies in his custody. Life in the Big Apple can be very hard.
THURSDAY july 9
REALITY
Big Brother 11
CBS, Global, 8 p.m.Mercy, has Big Brother been on American television 11 seasons already? Time flies on reality television. The format places 15 people into a house, located somewhere in an L.A. suburb, that has been fitted with dozens of cameras and microphones to record their every move. The houseguests squawk and squabble and vote each other off the show each week; the last one receives $500,000. And that's the entire concept of Big Brother , which so far has never become the viewing sensation in America that it was in the U.K. Will the eleventh time be the charm?
DOCUMENTARY
Doc Zone:
The Truth About Liars
CBC, 9 p.m.Some facts presented in this lighthearted documentary may greatly surprise viewers. Did you know, for example, that researchers have ascertained that all people are accomplished liars by the age of four? The rationale is that we lie to protect the feelings of others, and to get what we want and need. One recent study estimates that most of us tell a lie in one of every four conversations lasting more than 10 minutes. The film profiles somelegendary lies of recent history - for example, Richard Nixon's "I am not a crook" - and brings up an unsettling side-effect: All that fibbing has society expecting only the untruth from people in positions of power.
REALITY
Crime 360
A & E, 9 p.m.
The true-crime series follows the extensive investigation into a grisly double-murder. The episode opens in a peaceful Indianapolis suburb, where two men have been found fatally beaten. The case is handed over to veteran Detective Bobby Flack, who quickly learns the victims had previously been harassed for being gay. Along with fellow officers, Flack believes the killer is likely a neighbour who objected to the men's lifestyle.
DRAMA
Falcon Beach
YTV, 10 p.m.Filmed on location at Winnipeg Beach a few years back, Falcon Beach was conceived with high hopes for broadcast in the U.S.; the producers actually filmed two versions of each episode: The first was for Canadian audiences and used homegrown terminology (such as "eh" and "hoser"). A second version (for U.S. viewers) includesAmericanisms (such as "y'all"). Typical teen high jinks sustain tonight's outing: Handsome Jason (Steve Byers) goes for broke while competing in the local wakeboarding championship. And young Paige (Jennifer Kydd) experiences first-time responsibility when she has to look after her problematic Goth niece.

In the Lakeview community in Mississauga, there are many new and renovated properties, such as this detached, brick bungalow.
The sellers greatly increased its value by updating the mechanics and modernizing the layout over the past seven years, as well as adding "high-end and artistic renovations," agent Andrea Morrison says.
Two buyers submitted offers for the three-bedroom residence, which now features a combined living and dining area and an open kitchen that creates a more "welcoming and open main floor," the agent says.
Slate floors were installed in the kitchen, and hardwood was used elsewhere.
The main bathroom was redone, and the basement was finished with a recreation room containing a gas fireplace, pot lights and above-grade windows.
Work was also done to replace the furnace and the plumbing and electrical systems.
The southwest-facing backyard was landscaped with a pond, garden shed and garage/workshop equipped with power and a wood stove. "It is a fabulous lot, a gardener's paradise," Ms. Morrison says.
Local attractions include waterfront parks, golf courses and shopping centres, including Sherway Gardens. Highway 427 and the Queen Elizabeth Way are a short drive away.

Full text:   Move over, golf communities: New housing developments have become fertile ground for organic farms
The bewildered Iowan who converted his farm into a ballpark in Field of Dreams in 1989 might reverse the move today. From Vermont to central California, developers are creating subdivisions around organic farms to attract buyers. If you plant it, these developers believe, they will buy.
Increasingly, subdivisions, usually master-planned developments at which buyers purchase sites or raw land, have been treating farms as an amenity. "There are currently at least 200 projects that include agriculture as a key community component," said Ed McMahon, a senior fellow with the Urban Land Institute.
In 2001, investors in a stalled project with an agriculture component outside Boise, Idaho, recruited Frank Martin to take over their development. Mr. Martin had been a manager at Prairie Crossing, a subdivision built around a working farm in the Chicago suburb of Gray's Lake.
By 2008, the 1,756-acre Idaho development had repaid a $12-million loan from the financing arm of General Motors; realized a 61 per cent premium on the sale of its sites, compared with similar parcels with no farm nearby; and claimed a $2.8-million pretax profit by selling 785 of 800 lots, while keeping 1,000 acres open.
The success of the two developments proved the concept, and like-minded developers around the country are trying it on inactive farmland and even on formerly industrial land.
"Open space improves the return for a developer," Mr. McMahon said. "We have 16,000 subdivisions around golf courses, where developers found they could charge a lot premium of 25 to 50 per cent over comparable tract subdivision. But most people who live on golf courses do not play golf."
The latest variation is blending in working agriculture, Mr. McMahon said. Living with a farm, he noted, can bring a buyer permanent views, wholesome activities for children, access to walking and riding trails and inclusion in an epicurean club.
In South Burlington, David Scheuer, a developer, runs a firm called Retrovest that specializes in pedestrian-friendly subdivisions. He is adapting the Prairie Crossing model with a 220-acre project called South Village, where he eventually hopes to sell 334 homes at prices between $200,000 and $700,000.
A 16-acre segment of the property, which was not previously used for farming, is now producing lettuce, garlic and other crops, which are harvested for sale to homeowners and others from the area who have joined a local community-supported agriculture group. "Agriculture can be the caboose on the train," Mr. Scheuer said, "and housing can be the engine." Once he is selling 20 homes a year, he said, he hopes to pay the salary of a full-time farmer.
At the 220-home Serenbe project near Atlanta's airport, the cachet of local produce has been added to retiree-friendly businesses, including galleries, a bed-and-breakfast and three restaurants. Steve Nygren, an Atlanta restaurant impresario, started the project on his 900-acre farm.
"We preserved forest and pasture, and there were 20 acres left for an organic farm, and we also have a large wildflower meadow," Mr. Nygren said. "We've set up the design so 90 per cent of the houses back up to one of those natural amenities. We are selling our lots at a premium that's probably three times what the raw lot is."
Mr. Nygren has focused Serenbe's second phase on "edible landscaping," he said. "At street corners there are blueberry bushes, fig bushes, peach trees and spotted apple trees."
And in more rural areas, developers are buying big tracts of ranchland and selling small lots to buyers. David Hamilton, a principal in Qroe Farm Preservation Development, is pursuing this approach at the sprawling Bundoran Farm subdivision outside Charlottesville, Va. "We go through a mapping process to see functional agricultural units, if they are good for apples or cattle or whatever, then see where they go together.
Qroe (pronounced "crow") leases some of the land to cattle ranchers and orchard managers. A buyer of a home site hires a builder from a developer-approved list. Qroe is marketing lots of under four acres for less than $400,000, Mr. Hamilton said. "You're buying two acres but access to 2,000 acres," he said.
Grady Lewis, a Virginia native who closed on his 2.67-acre lot in 2007 and moved into his 1,800-square-foot house at Bundoran with his wife Diane this spring, responded to Qroe's idea of preserving "rural quality."
When all the house lots have been sold, the rental income from the farmers, which currently goes to the developer, will go to the homeowners' association. "Beyond it being great to see 300 head of Angus scattered across the acres," Mr. Lewis said, "it's a cash-flow issue."
Farm-focused developers must juggle financing a few houses at a time with cultivating crops on a yearly cycle, so many rent farmland to professionals.
Mr. Scheuer hired David Miskell, a veteran Vermont organic farmer, to help convert the property's damaged soil. Working organically, which Mr. Miskell translates to "a lot of manure," he and two hired farmers replenished the soil with enough nitrogen to grow greens, root crops and sunflowers this year. "Upfront costs are high to build fertility, but I doubt they are any higher than any golf course," Mr. Miskell said. "Mainly, we are growing healthy organic food for healthy homeowners."
Because a farm's open space takes land from the tax rolls, a developer often donates some land for public use. Hidden Springs sold a parcel to the local school district for $10,000, and Retrovest deeded South Burlington some land with road frontage for a soccer field and playground.
But developers stress that their housing units should stand on their own for the idea of the farm-as-amenity to click.

Defined by undefinability: Works just fine: [1]

Abstract: Don't worry: This being Canada, it goes without saying that we'll soon mistrust our newfound confidence as well, and revert to trying to define ourselves by our undefinability, by our lack of certainty - and who's to say that's such a bad thing? Who really wants their national character cast in unchangeable stone? That way lies disaster - because, as Dickens said of Mr. Dombey, an obstinate nature carries the burden of itself wherever it goes.

Full text:   ibrown@globeandmail.com
Here's a thing that makes Canada Canadian: Every year, on Canada Day, a quiz or poll reveals that Canadians have a very shaky notion of what it means to be Canadian. We think we like lacrosse, a Canadian game, but we actually prefer basketball, which was only invented by a Canadian. We imagine ourselves "a northern people," but only a handful of us have been closer to the Arctic than the local Wal-Mart. Nearly half of us think bilingualism is important, but only 12 per cent of any region outside Quebec speak even remotely competent French, tant pi s .
This sort of national cliché smashing happens so regularly that we long ago turned it into a national cliché: To be Canadian was to cast doubt on what it meant to be Canadian. It was not a glorious conception of a nation, or grand, or shiny like armour and pride. But it worked well enough.
Consider the evidence. In the 1,200 years since first nations people first roamed across the not-so-true north strong and free, no one managed to control the joint for very long. Unlike the bold, blustering Americans, driven by manifest destiny and the desire to make a place free from the chains of their oppressors, the history of Canada was essentially the story of a small group of shy strangers who ended up having to do favours for one another, whether they wanted to or not, on account of a) the weather and b) the fact that the nearest supermarket was so damned far away. Our national character was a polyglot of radically different cultures trying to make a semi-decent living without infuriating anyone a lot bigger than we are.
And that worked. The first nations held on longest: No one could say they dominate anything today, but they've made big gains in real estate. The French ran things for a while, but ended up having to be content with official language status and the full run of Quebec. Anglos, once dominant, are falling nowadays to Asians and Indians - and a lot of people, Anglos included, consider this a positive development.

Here's a thing that makes Canada Canadian: Every year, on Canada Day, a quiz or poll reveals that Canadians have a very shaky notion of what it means to be Canadian. We think we like lacrosse, a Canadian game, but we actually prefer basketball, which was only invented by a Canadian. We imagine ourselves "a northern people," but only a handful of us have been closer to the Arctic than the local Wal-Mart. Nearly half of us think bilingualism is important, but only 12 per cent of any region outside Quebec speak even remotely competent French, tant pi s .
This sort of national cliché smashing happens so regularly that we long ago turned it into a national cliché: To be Canadian was to cast doubt on what it meant to be Canadian. It was not a glorious conception of a nation, or grand, or shiny like armour and pride. But it worked well enough.
Consider the evidence. In the 1,200 years since first nations people first roamed across the not-so-true north strong and free, no one managed to control the joint for very long. Unlike the bold, blustering Americans, driven by manifest destiny and the desire to make a place free from the chains of their oppressors, the history of Canada was essentially the story of a small group of shy strangers who ended up having to do favours for one another, whether they wanted to or not, on account of a) the weather and b) the fact that the nearest supermarket was so damned far away. Our national character was a polyglot of radically different cultures trying to make a semi-decent living without infuriating anyone a lot bigger than we are.
And that worked. The first nations held on longest: No one could say they dominate anything today, but they've made big gains in real estate. The French ran things for a while, but ended up having to be content with official language status and the full run of Quebec. Anglos, once dominant, are falling nowadays to Asians and Indians - and a lot of people, Anglos included, consider this a positive development. (Canadians secretly believe that life at the top is too harrowing.)
Catholics and Protestants, Ontario and the West (and more recently Newfoundland), Liberals and Tories, farmers and freight kings, McGill and U of T, gays and straights - they all had their respective day in the maple-leaf dappled sun, saw power come and go and come again. Even the NDP got itself elected a couple of times. The truth is, Canadians mistrust power, and we don't really like people who project the impression that they deserve to have it.

Full text: Indigo knows it can't stand still as e-readers gain in popularity - so it's finding creative ways to keep customers in its stores
When Heather Reisman made her 2001 industry-transforming acquisition of Canada's largest bookseller, her challenge was to stem losses at Chapters and Indigo stores by paring costs and getting the right books onto shelves.
Now, Indigo Books & Music Inc. is in the black, although suffering along with other retailers. But Ms. Reisman faces what could be a bigger threat in the form of Kindle and other electronic reading devices - e-readers - that are quickly catching on among book buyers, especially in the United States.
Earlier this year, Indigo's chief executive officer responded with the retailer's own digital reading service called Shortcovers, which can be used on smart phones and other devices.
But that won't be enough for Indigo to head off what Ms. Reisman figures will be a 15-per-cent erosion in its book sales in the next five years, lost to the digital world.
"All content wants to be digital, whether it's music or newspapers or books or blogs," Ms. Reisman says. "Our business will be affected, as well as all other content businesses."
To respond, Indigo is becoming a bigger destination for children, teenagers and their parents, stocking more toys, teen-oriented books and products, and more customized merchandise to appeal to various markets.
Ms. Reisman is also adding armchairs and bean bags to keep customers lingering in the stores longer, and purchasing more. (Several years ago, she replaced comfortable sofas with hard chairs, because the couches were messy.)
It's essential that Ms. Reisman move quickly in the rapidly changing sector. In the United States, where the market is more competitive, booksellers are suffering sharp declines in store traffic and sales, squeezed by recession-weary consumers who are turning more to e-readers.
E-readers make up just 2 per cent of U.S. book sales, but that's up so far this year from less than 1 per cent of the $24.3-billion (U.S.) of sales in 2008, according to the Association of American Publishers.
Borders Group Inc. , the second-largest U.S. bookseller, is under pressure from its investors to reverse its flagging fortunes; Barnes & Noble Inc. , the top chain which is faring a bit better, is preparing for the digital age with the recent acquisition of a leading e-books retailer and plans to launch a new e-bookstore this year.
The chains are keeping an eye on Amazon.com Inc. and its increasingly popular Kindle e-reader - which is not yet sold in Canada - and Google Inc. and its aggressive foray into the electronic book world.
"For the legacy booksellers that own lots of real estate, this is the beginning of a very difficult decline for their industry," says Sarah Rotman Epps, an analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. "We've seen how in other industries owning bricks-and-mortar stores becomes a liability rather than an asset."
Indigo is in a much stronger position in Canada, where it is by far the largest traditional book player. Still, Ms. Reisman knows she can't stand still.
She started by wooing children and their parents with toys about four years ago, after her research showed that 40 per cent of Indigo customers were adults with kids. Parents wanted educational and stimulating toys, not video games or battery-powered cars. (The chain promptly dropped in-store DVD monitors playing Dora the Explore r, after parents gave them a thumbs-down in a test run.)
Ms. Reisman worried initially that the toys might cannibalize Indigo's book sales, but in fact the stores with toys enjoy stronger book sales than those without, says chief merchant Joel Silver. Customers tend to stay longer in outlets with toys, and wander over to the books.
The toy business is getting such a bounce that it will be expanded to all 90 superstores in the next two or three years, from about 15 today, Ms. Reisman says. By then, Indigo intends to become the country's second-largest toy specialty retailer, after Toys "R" Us.
Beyond children, Ms. Reisman is chasing the teen crowd.
"We always thought that teens have a lot to do that doesn't include reading books," she says.
"Well, it turns out teens love to be in our stores. Our teen business has been on fire."
She's cashing in on publishers' recent push to produce books catering to teens such as the Twilight teen-vampire series, which get a buzz and become part of youth culture.
Indigo is trying to keep teenagers coming back by putting bean bag chairs close to the teen sections and touting "mother-and-daughter reads." Other initiatives, such as a test later this year of a photo studio that will allow customers to custom-design their own books, are also designed to draw teens to Indigo.
The efforts are paying off. Teen sales have jumped more than 200 per cent over the past five years, Mr. Silver says.
Other products are being customized to local customers' tastes. About 30 per cent of Indigo's book offerings are chosen for their local appeal, he says. Heavy investments in supply-chain technology have allowed staff to track closely shifting customer demand.
"We want customers to feel that every single store is idiosyncratically merchandised to them," Ms. Reisman says, adding: "The books that are bought in the downtown area are not bought out in the suburbs."
And she's expanding her already significant gift section with forays into the eco-world, along with a completely new lifestyle chain of stores called Pistachio, which sell nothing but environmentally friendly paper and beauty products.
Gross profit margins of some gift items, such as stationery, can be up to 20 per cent more than those of books. In August, Pistachio and Indigo will roll out green back-to-school gear. "All regular things you buy at Grand & Toy, priced like Grand & Toy," Ms. Reisman says.
With the expansion into non-book segments, it may look like there are fewer books on Indigo shelves. But there are more titles than ever, as a more efficient supply chain allows the stores to stock just 10 of each title, compared with 40 five years ago, she says. Shelves are now replenished every two days, while in the past, restocking was erratic.
"Books are not disappearing in any way, shape or form," Ms. Reisman says. "Our job is to make sure our assortment in our stores is so compelling that people continue to come."

What investors should know
Indigo stock
Investors got a treat when Indigo Books & Music Inc. declared its first dividend, paying 10 cents a share to shareholders in June. While the prospect of the cash payment helped give the stock a temporary lift, it wasn't enough to bring it back to the 52-week high reached almost a year ago. Chief financial officer Jim McGill told Indigo's annual meeting this week that the company thinks its performance warrants "a much higher price."
Sara O'Brien, an analyst at RBC Dominion Securities Inc., rates the stock "outperform (above average risk)" based on its return potential; she has a one-year target price of $16. "We expect solid results to drive its multiple higher over the next year, rewarding shareholders," she wrote recently.
Indigo performance
Despite tough times, Indigo is outperforming its U.S. book chain counterparts. It generated a fourth-quarter same-store sales increase of 3.8 per cent in its superstores and 6.2 per cent in its smaller stores, while major U.S. retailers reported drops in those sales. (Same-store sales are those in outlets open a year or more, and are considered a key retail barometer.)
Gains were driven by a healthy business in its children's, toy and "lifestyle" gift sections. Ms. O'Brien, one of the few analysts following the stock, points to stronger trends in Canada than in the U.S. The company has benefited from Canadian consumers "still willing to spend on books, coupled with Indigo's positioning and store innovation," she writes.
The digital world
The anticipated proliferation in digital reading in the coming years will have "far-reaching" effects on booksellers, warns Sarah Rotman Epps, an analyst at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass. "Chain booksellers will double-down and then go belly up," she writes in a recent report on the U.S. book sector. As with Blockbuster in the video-chain space, book retailers will have a tough time keeping up, she says. Still, Indigo is in a better position, facing relatively little competition in Canada. Ms. Rotman Epps is impressed with its new Shortcovers division, which allows users to buy and download e-books to a smart phone or other device.

Full text: When your family home is four centuries old, how do you stop it from crumbling? For some old English families, the answer is opening the manor to the public. Janet Forman visits her husband's ancestral manse - and finds his relatives are supporting their grande dame by welcoming visitors with jazz and artisanal food
Visiting distant relations often has its share of surprises. And while my husband, Tom Houghton, and I were somewhat stunned by the arrow-straight, kilometre-long driveway and the vast banquet hall lined with 4,000 panes of Flemish glass we found at his family seat, we certainly didn't expect apparitions. Yet Hoghton Tower, the manor my spouse's forebears left more than 350 years ago,
is ranked the "Third Most Haunted Building in Britain."
"Once when the guides were telling ghost stories, I couldn't resist hiding and opening and closing the doors," recalls Lady Rosanna de Hoghton, who with her husband, Sir Bernard, runs the estate owned by the de Hoghton family since the Norman Conquest. "They were so terrified they locked up everything behind them - and locked me out! I had to climb over a hedge to get back in."
The main buildings were rebuilt in Tudor times, and we soon learned that it takes a monumental effort to preserve a 16th-century way of life in the 21st century. Yet while many British estates have been commercialized or lost to taxes, the fiercely independent de Hoghtons still run theirs much as they have for nearly a millennium: as a family affair.
With imagination and quite a bit of elbow grease, the de Hoghtons support their Grand Dame with symphony and
jazz concerts, archery demonstrations, medieval-style puppet shows for children and classic car and motorcycle shows, as well as by leasing land to farmers.
But despite bearing a name that is peppered through the history books - the family tree includes Lady Godiva, Shakespeare apparently worked on the estate as a 16-year-old tutor's assistant, and oral tradition says it was here that King James I dubbed a massive side of beef "Sir Loin" - in many ways the de Hoghtons are a family like our own.
We soon found common ground in the realm of housekeeping. As a homeowner who has weathered his share of boiler and plumbing issues, my husband was as enthralled with the family's sagas of retrofitting modern heating systems into foot-thick stone walls and preventive measures such as "resting" the tapestries - a task absent from the spring cleaning ritual at our house - as with ancient yarns of
battling Roundheads in the courtyard.
"Of course, this house has its share of problems," grants Lady Rosanna, an Italian-born physician. "But that's because it's not a museum; it's a living thing."
Take the drapes, a wall of fabric cascading from ceiling to floor. They "can never be touched," she says, "or they'd fall apart. All we can do is dust them lightly.
"And the carpets have to be rolled up for cleaning. It's a heavy job, and for some reason no one wants to help us. So Bernard and I end up hauling them outside and draping them over the garden wall," Lady Rosanna says with a laugh, recalling some of their more inglorious domestic episodes.
"People have the misconception that we have battalions of people doing everything for us," observes another Thomas de Hoghton, their 29-year-old son, a fine-arts photographer who appears this morning in work boots and jeans preparing to hunt down a particularly venal dry rot that has invaded the rafters. "It's really quite the opposite: You end up doing a lot of it yourself."
Among the events the de Hoghtons stage for the public to support their manse, the most popular may be the monthly Merchant of Hoghton Farmers Market, where dozens of artisan food purveyors riding the crest of England's locavore movement spill across meadows around the Great Barn.
Many have regional roots to rival the de Hoghtons, such as fourth-generation farmer Clive Waring, who maintains that his purple carrots predate the eponymous variety bred by William of Orange, and cattle breeders at Savin Hill, whose heritage British Whites are related to a herd kept at Hoghton Tower in centuries past.
If Hoghton Tower is now better known to epicures seeking world-class smoked kippers and freshly baked Fidget Pie than to tourists, few realize that it was one of the first stately homes opened to the public, in 1946.
"Before that, the only way to visit a place like this was to be quietly sneaked in by a footman when the family was away, or perhaps at a charitable event arranged by the vicar," Sir Bernard observes. "But my parents felt people needed some diversion during that period of privation after World War II, and I think a lot of people are interested in how others live. Including me - I often take a Busman's Holiday to see grand homes."
The de Hoghtons' efforts made us keen to see how other venerable homes were preserved, and we were pleased to learn that we could rent our own historic digs from the National Trust.
Beyond restoring culturally important properties such as Sissinghurst Castle Garden, Winston Churchill's Chartwell and the childhood homes of John Lennon and Paul McCartney, this organization also preserves lighthouses, dovecotes, pubs, even entire villages such as the wistful Lacock, where parts of Harry Potter were filmed.
From a list that includes mills, thatched cottages - even the wireless station in Cornwall where Marconi developed the precursor to radio and Agatha Christie's holiday home in Devon - we chose a 14th-century manse 90 minutes east of Heathrow so true to period we had trouble finding the bedroom along a warren of hallways.
From here, we drove south just past Gatwick to East
Sussex, arriving at a gamekeeper's cottage so deep in the woods the trust deems
it "not recommended
for those of a nervous
disposition."
Our next dwelling, a few hours north in Yorkshire, felt even more isolated: a 19th-century stone barn in the middle of the moors, ingeniously transformed with a breakfast nook tucked between the cow stalls. Our only neighbours were baby lambs pressing their noses against the glass doors. Beyond the reach of the Internet and TV, we were startled when our GPS informed us we were just over the Pennine Mountains from Hoghton Tower, barely 30 minutes' drive.
At Sir Bernard's urging, we also travelled 20 minutes north of Hoghton Tower to the Trough of Bowland, whose mist-shrouded moors with mythic names such as Clougha and Fair Snape inspired J.R.R. Tolkien's Lord of the Rings .
Recently, this heather-covered region has been dipping a toe into tourism, a move ironically facilitated by the Internet.
"We're so deep in the country, there are no 'walk in' guests," says Michael Lawson, who together with his wife, Marie, has transformed 300-year-old Wolfen Mill into self-catering cottages. "We built because on the Internet,
people can find us."
A few miles away, the Inn at Whitewell has managed to attract guests without the aid of the Internet for eight centuries. A major draw is its bucolic location above the River Hodder, "where we hope it will stay," owner Charlie Bowman says.
Bowman's infatuation with country auctions has filled the inn's 23 rooms with canopied beds and "far too many less-than-efficient Victorian bathing machines," and his knowledge of fine vintages sustains a lobby wine shop, Bowland Forest Vintners, which is surprisingly sophisticated for a country hamlet.
While this ravishing agricultural region remains wedded to its past, a number of erudite food and drink outlets are surfacing to meet the trickle of tourism. The most evocative is Bashall Barn, a sprawling "agri-mall" selling local products such as lamb and mint burgers, sticky
toffee pudding and freshly brewed beer. Soon, 60,000 bees will take up residence beside the café, whose windows overlook the cow stalls.
Bowland cheese maker
Bob Kitching, who is reawakening interest in traditional Lancashire styles by adding ingredients such as ginger and mint, also sells his
wares at the Merchant of Hoghton.
"We make a real effort to gather the best producers here," Sir Bernard says as we tuck into tea with freshly baked scones and Eccles cakes.
Like their neighbouring farmers, bakers and innkeepers, the de Hoghtons are "constantly sniffing the air for new opportunities.
"Our aim is to keep the house standing, so we don't stay static," Lady Rosanna says, considering the logistics of renting the East Wing as a serviced cottage as she spoons out an olive-studded stew of rabbit from the
estate.
"Watch out for the buckshot," Thomas warns as he fishes a silver pellet from his dish.
"I studied Classics before I studied medicine," Lady Rosanna reflects, "so my attitude toward the house is a little different from Bernard's. For him, it's his family. I feel we are guardians of a piece of culture that belongs not just to England but to the world.
"I think the greatest achievement of mankind is when we create something, when we build something, like this house."

Abstract: Dan Shipley, the 55-year-old architect who built two homes there ("Like a Houseboat" and "Ford Trimotor," a homage to a 1925 airplane) likes the variety. "I'm all for a range of interpretations," he says. "As more houses are built they'll blend better," Ms. [Diane Cheatham] adds.

Full text: Some residential suburban communities insist on tiled roofs; others dictate colour palettes and lot sizes. Often, the goal is to capture the look of a time in the past, before modern living and high housing costs changed tastes and materials.
But a small number of new developments are taking the opposite tack. Here, buried among a middle-class community and near the Central Expressway, is a street where the construction of colonials and Tudors is expressly forbidden. Even mid-century modern is considered passé. "Make no mistake. It's a dictatorship and I make the rules," project developer Diane Cheatham says half-jokingly.
The result is Urban Reserve, a 13-acre development devoted to contemporary design. Pass a neighbourhood of standard issue brick tract ranches and turn onto Vanguard Way and suddenly one confronts what looks like a scene from a science fiction movie.
One building looks like a rusty metal box; down the road is "Like a Houseboat," a boxy structure bearing the lines of its namesake. At one end stands a grey and tan stucco home with a silo-like tower - its owners plan to use an upstairs deck for martini parties. At the street's other end is a steel and reclaimed redwood structure that looks like an enormous tree house.
Currently there are 16 homes here ranging from 2,100 to nearly 4,000 square feet that are finished or in various stages of construction. Two spec houses are for sale: a boxy green "Cube" house for $699,000 (U.S.) and a 4,000-square-foot two-storey ranch-like home with a wood-filled interior for $1.4-million.
Oversight of the street is firmly in the hands of Ms. Cheatham, the developer who with her approval committee works to ensure that every home exemplifies what she calls "early 21st century north Texas modernism." A concept that took off in the 1950s, Texas modernism refers to homes that use local materials, are designed to respond to the area's hot summers and mild winters, and nod to traditional Texas structures, says Donald Gatzke, dean of the architecture school at the University of Texas at Arlington.
At Urban Reserve the message can get a bit blurry. The home Ms. Cheatham is currently living in there is topped with slate from Vermont. Architect Lionel Morrison, who designed the city's new $150-million One Arts Plaza as well as numerous multimillion-dollar homes, is a big fan of the development - he designed the first house built there - but says the experimentation can be a little much.
"Young architects sometimes feel the need to get all their ideas into first houses because they might not get another chance," says Mr. Morrison, 59, who adds that others liken the street to a modern petting zoo.
Dan Shipley, the 55-year-old architect who built two homes there ("Like a Houseboat" and "Ford Trimotor," a homage to a 1925 airplane) likes the variety. "I'm all for a range of interpretations," he says. "As more houses are built they'll blend better," Ms. Cheatham adds.
Other modernist subdivisions have sprung up in recent years. In the Hamptons of Long Island in New York, the Houses at Sagaponac, started by developer Harry Joe Brown and architect Richard Meier, are modern homes that use traditional materials and carry price tags at about $4.5-million over the past couple of years. The project's goal is to ramp up production to three homes a year instead of two.
In Dallas, another modern development called Kessler Woods started in 2002. Gated and located in a more upscale community, it focuses on the mid-century modern look that Urban Reserve's Ms. Cheatham eschews. All 30 lots have been sold and 20 houses have been built, four of which are for sale at asking prices between $799,000 and $1.3-million.
For the past couple of decades, Dallas had been dominated by what locals dub "Big Hair Houses," with cathedral ceilings and grand traditional façades. That began to change several years ago, as modernism began to dominate the local commercial design scene. The city's new arts district will have four buildings - an opera house, sculpture centre, symphony hall and performing arts centre - designed by Pritzker prize-winning architects. Only one major new building in the city over the past decade (the Ritz-Carlton) has been a traditional design.
"In the old days I used to say we only do modern, I know it isn't superpopular, but there's enough to keep us busy," Mr. Morrison says. "That's changed."
The house Mr. Morrison designed is a crisp white box completed in 2007 for more than $800,000 that compromises nothing in its pursuit of precision and minimalism. It is owned by Robert Moore, 53, a Texas native who started the Dallas Voice, one of the city's first gay newspapers, and his partner Terry Thompson, 54, a photographer. It is almost completely devoid of ornament. There are white marble countertops in the kitchen, white stone in the bathrooms and straight-lined white leather furniture. Many walls are left blank.
When they first moved in, Mr. Moore and Mr. Thompson staged "white" parties, serving white wine and white cosmopolitans to avoid staining the white marble counters and furniture. "It would be a huge mistake for someone who couldn't maintain a minimalist lifestyle to build a house like this," says Moore says.
Mr. Moore and Mr. Thompson say Urban Reserve has helped create a community. "We've had more interaction with our neighbours here in two years than we did in 12 years in our old house," Mr. Thompson says. "We have dinner together, go to the theatre, have parties."
Ms. Cheatham has made up new lawn signs: "Cool people live here. Please do not disturb."

Full text: Employing Frank Lloyd Wright's organic principles of architecture, this house flows from one high-ceilinged room to another
348 Balsam Dr.
What: A luxurious five-bedroom, six-bathroom custom-designed family home boasts approximately 10,000 square feet of living space on a 150 by 151 tree-lined lot.
Asking price: $3.5-million
Taxes: $20,592 (2009)
Agent: Royal LePage Real
Estate Services Ltd. (Judith Hanley)
Interior walls of windows bring the outside inside this house on the edge of a wood.
While the modernist design is fairly new - local architect Gren Weiss built the house on the site of an old bungalow in 1989 - the surrounding trees are old and sheltering, creating an oasis of calm in the heart of neighbourhood teeming with splashy multimillion-dollar luxury residences.
Homeowner Terri Mallory McMahon says the trees are what convinced her to buy the property in 2004, having first spied it online from her former perch in Belleville, Ont.
Or make that tree.
"I'm from the South," says Ms. McMahon, a native of Atlanta who moved north after marrying her Canadian husband, John, 17 years ago.
"When I saw this old-fashioned dogwood in the front garden, a tree I grew up with but rarely see in Canada, I knew I had to have this house. It was meant to be."
She packed up her family, as well as the family dog, and moved to Oakville, a city she knew nothing about, but soon grew to love.
"It's cosmopolitan living with a small-town atmosphere," she says. "I'm walking distance to everything - the lake, great shopping and restaurants, parks and schools. It's a very pedestrian-oriented and very safe neighbourhood."
Despite being minutes from the downtown core, an abundance of greenery lends her area of Oakville a rural feel, compelling Ms. McMahon to say that her home isn't just her castle, "it's my cottage. ...
"When I come up to my bedroom, I sometimes just close the door and look out at all thetreetops and think I'm in a forest," Ms. McMahon says. "I love the simplicity, the feeling of calm."
An interior design incorporating several of Frank Lloyd Wright's organic principles of architecture helps keep the tranquillity flowing, one high-ceilinged room to another.
Natural materials abound, from the Hawaiian lava tile in the front foyer and the cherry-stained maple wood used on the rest of the floors, to the cedar plank ceiling in the kitchen and the glass block used in the main floor powder room, one of six bathrooms that Ms. McMahon, a part-time home stager, completely gutted and then redesigned herself.
Floor-to-ceiling windows throughout the house not only forge an indelible connection between it and its surrounding sylvan site, they fill the interior with natural light and a feeling of airiness throughout.
But instead of open concept, as many modern structures are, this house consists of large-scale rooms, each linked to the other by means of glass walls that lend the home a feeling of transparency.
"To me it's very Zen," says Ms. McMahon, who has built upon the home's innate peacefulness by creating a meditation room on the lower level where once an indoor pool had been.
High humidity levels, and the fact that after just a year in the house the novelty of having a pool in the basement had worn off her two teenage daughters, prompted Ms. McMahon to come up with a new use for what she calls "1,000 square feet of wasted space."
In its place, she created a home spa with an infrared sauna and a state-of-the-art home gym with walkouts to a series of landscaped terraces. The floors are made of engineered hardwood, a "green" product chosen because the room, with its wall of windows overlooking the backyard garden, is meant to pay "homage to nature," Ms. McMahon says.
But not everything in the house is enthrall to the great outdoors.
The entire home is wired for sound, allowing music to stream through every room. On the lower level is a home theatre room with surround sound and a built-in video/karaoke system with a wall-mounted camera. This is where artifice reigns, as evidenced by the built-in Hollywood-inspired library of DVDs hidden behind a moving wall. Where Mother Nature, in this house at least, meets her match.

Carolyn Ireland reports The late realist painter Ken Danby spent more than 30 years of his life restoring an old mill over the Speed River. The cherished home was a fixture in his paintings and will be hard to let go, his widow says
Artist Ken Danby drew inspiration from many Canadian icons: The goalie in his crease, the force of Lake Superior and the Calgary Stampede stand as some of his world-famous images.
But no landscape appeared more often in tableaux by the late realist painter than his surroundings at the restored 19th-century flour mill in rural Ontario where he lived with his wife Gillian until his death in 2007.
Mr. Danby often captured in oil and tempera the Speed River - frozen solid in winter and gently flowing in dappled summer light.
During a recent tour of the property, Ms. Danby pointed to a rusty gate hanging precariously at the top of a set of stone steps.
Mr. Danby depicted his small son Sean gently swinging in the painting titled On the Gate .
The weathered stone steps have made many appearances. And there's the recurrent theme of the picturesque stone mill itself, which was built in 1856 and renovated by the artist over three decades.
The 47-acre estate near Guelph is currently for sale. In addition to the mill, which has been transformed into a five-bedroom, five-bathroom house, the miller's original stone house still stands. The old barn provides the foundation for a studio and office building, while a separate stables, paddock and indoor arena accommodate the horses.
Peter Bowers of Moffat Dunlap Real Estate Ltd. has listed the property with an asking price of $3.7-million.
The land includes 2,000 feet of river frontage, walking trails and woods.
Mr. Bowers says the artist bought the property in the 1960s when he was 27. At the time, the building was slated to be torn down.
"The locals used to come and shoot rats here."
Mr. Danby, who was working as an artist at the time, saw historic buildings worth preserving and stepped forward to buy Armstrong Mill, as it was known.
"The roof collapsed the next year," Mr. Bowers says. "It was derelict."
Records show the mill was built by John S. Armstrong, who was born in 1829 within walking distance of the site. The mill was a massive limestone building built into the bedrock beside the Speed River using stone quarried from the site. A water wheel powered three pairs of stones for grinding flour and one pair for feed.
The mill was known for its high-quality flour and Mr. Armstrong's business prospered. The mill housed the post office and a stage coach stop. Farmers would deliver their grain and stay overnight at an inn across the road before returning to pick up the flour or feed the next day.
The Armstrong family operated the mill until 1903. It changed hands a few times before George Parkinson purchased it in 1931. The vibrating machinery and severe weather had caused the structure to deteriorate over the years, and Mr. Parkinson removed the top 1½ storeys, reducing the mill to its current proportions.
Work at the mill came to an end in the spring of 1950 after the dam burst in heavy flooding.
Ms. Danby says she thinks of the refurbished mill as the embodiment of Mr. Danby's artistry.
"He was a man with a vision at 27 years old. It's his creation."
Ms. Danby says the limestone required extensive repair.
"He had a full-time stone mason here for 10 years."
Inside, Mr. Danby had massive beams taken down, numbered, refinished and reinstalled. The room that serves as a large living room today consisted of four crumbling stone walls open to the sky when Mr. Danby started his overhaul.
Throughout the house, Mr. Danby incorporated as much of the wood, stone and machinery from the historic mill as possible into the new design. Wide floorboards are built into the kitchen island, for example, while another artifact was used as the newel post in a stairway.
In the garden, Mr. Danby created a sculpture from the mill's grinding gear.
A third-floor studio was one of several spaces designed to accommodate Mr. Danby's prolific output.
"A lot's gone on here," Mr. Bowers says.
Today, paintings and sketches by Mr. Danby hang throughout the house and provide a record of his life in the bucolic landscape.
Ms. Danby recalls the family waking up one Christmas morning to the first big snowfall of the year. Mr. Danby rushed everyone outside so that he could capture the scene of his grandkids skating in front of the mill while their Mom and Dad pulled a Christmas tree on a toboggan.
She adds that the painter's young grandson was becoming unnerved by the cracking sounds coming from the ice on the mill stream.
"He was afraid he was going to fall through and he was not very happy," she says.
Meanwhile everyone was keen to get back indoors to celebrate Christmas.
But Mr. Danby persuaded them all to stay in place until he could capture just the light and shadow that he was looking for. The painting later became the cover image for the Sears Wish Book.
A stand of trees on the former mill's race must show up in many living rooms.
"Those trees are quite immortal because Ken painted them a number of times," Mr. Bowers says.
He imagines the property as a family compound or a corporate retreat. Buyers from Europe have been interested because they are attracted to the large spread of land, he adds.
Guelph and nearby Elora offer a fine arts community.
Ms. Danby says leaving the land and her home of many years will be difficult.
"I'm fortunate that I've had 28 years here."

Full text: Author Tim Morawetz sleuths downtown streets for the tell-tale signs of a Jazz Age flavour
Tim Morawetz stands on the steps of the Mayfair apartments on Avenue Road in Toronto. After a lightning session pointing out the traits that place this handsome building firmly in an earlier period of art deco than neighbouring buildings up on St. Clair - strong verticality, piers with multiple planes and low-relief carvings of Jazz Age owls, lotus buds and sunbursts - he cranes his neck to take a closer look at one of the lighting sconces that frame the doorway.
"Look!" he says, pointing to a mounting bracket that passersby and, likely, building residents never see. Here too, there is a flourish, a detail that evinces a brain rather than a machine was behind the design. "Deco went from the largest, broadest detail about the building design right down to the most subtle detail," he says, clearly pleased.
And so, too, does his new self-published book, Art Deco Architecture in Toronto: A Guide to the City's Buildings from the Roaring Twenties and the Depression (Glue Inc., 2009). It takes a wide view of the style while drilling down to the smallest detail and, as such, it's a feast for armchair architourists and urban walkers alike.
After a foreword by local legend Eberhard Zeidler and a wonderful scene-setting essay by Paul G. Russell, Mr. Morawetz gently prepares the reader for the literary journey ahead with a primer: Pyramidal massing, banded windows, decorative spandrel panels, Vitrolite glass and sexy speed-stripes are introduced.
Next comes a rich catalogue of over 70 buildings wearing some, or all, of that deco finery. Mr. Morawetz reintroduces old friends such as Baldwin & Greene's 1928 Concourse Building (with its J.E.H. MacDonald-designed mosaic panels), Roy H. Bishop's 1929 Tip Top Tailors office/warehouse, Eaton's College Street and the "most decorated Art Deco apartment building in the city" at 2837 Yonge St., the Glen Grove. Better yet, lesser-known gems share the spotlight, such as Mathers and Haldenby's 1931 Campbell's Soup building on Birmingham Street, James H. Haffa's 1941 Saints Cyril and Methodius Catholic Church near Trinity-Bellwoods Park and a little creampuff of a house with rounded corners, metal railings and octagonal windows in Cedarvale (1938, architect unknown).
To represent the glitzy side of the style, there is a chapter on movie houses, covering everything from the grandiose 1934 Eglinton by theatre-masters Kaplan and Sprachman to the smaller 1939 Pylon (now the Royal) by Benjamin Swartz.
Two maps help readers locate what's still standing, since it was Mr. Morawetz's goal to write a book that "you'd be proud to leave out and flip through while you're having a glass of wine, or that you can put in your backpack on a nice Saturday and stroll through your neighbourhood and actually go see 10 buildings."
Throughout, connections are made. For instance, city of Toronto architect J.J. Woolnough not only designed the CNE's Horse Palace, but also Firehall No. 12 at 840 Gerrard St. E. and Police Station No. 12 at 2398 Yonge. Knowing this, it becomes easy to spot similarities between them. For connections of a different kind, there are over 60 invaluable architect biographies prepared by architect Robert G. Hill.
The deco bug bit the 51-year-old business writer during his college years. In the decades since, Mr. Morawetz has travelled to attend and lecture at many of the ten World Congresses on Art Deco, including one in Perth, Australia and created walking tours for Toronto Arts Week.
The book, in fact, was self-published in order to make it available to attendees of the Tenth World Congress on Art Deco in Montreal this past May. Mr. Morawetz stresses, however, that the soft-cover tome isn't just for globetrotting scholars: "Art deco, intrinsically, is a very friendly, accessible, popular style. I bet if you took a hundred people and showed them an art deco building, a modern building, a gothic church or an old fashioned bank with columns at the front, more than half of them would say 'The deco building speaks to me, I get it, I don't have to have an art degree to understand it.' "
Making it even easier to "get it" are 230 photographs taken by the author between 1980 and 1995 - meaning buildings now lost are represented - and their delightful captions, which often note items or interrelationships even the most seasoned observer might miss. "I wrote most of this book in a ski chalet up in Collingwood," he explains. "When my family was out skiing on weekends, I would be down in the basement with my computer on one table and my slide projector up on a box just gazing at the slides. And when you look at slides for five minutes, that's when [you find] the extra level of detail."
Now in front of Page and Steele's 1938 Park Lane Apartments on St. Clair West - famous for being classical pianist Glenn Gould's home for many years - Mr. Morawetz stops, mid-sentence, during a discussion of the streamlined moderne style: "I just noticed this now," he says, pointing to a brick post beside the parking ramp. It's capped with a stone that, rather than being a plain square, is stepped ever so slightly.
Yet another detail discovered... might be time to start planning the second edition.

Full text: 88 Carr St., Unit 32
Asking price: $325,000
Selling price: $320,000
Previous selling price: not available
Taxes: $2,546 (2008)
Days on the market: 49
Listing agents: Barbara and Peter Polson, and Eileen Stewart, Royal LePage Real Estate Services Ltd.
According to listing agent Eileen Stewart, this three-storey unit is one of the best dressed residences in a relatively new stacked condominium community just south of Alexandra Park downtown.
The previous owners selected better quality finishes from the builder, such as upgraded laminate flooring and granite kitchen countertops with undermounted sinks.
"It was really immaculate with lots of upgrades," Ms. Stewart says. "In comparison to the other [units], it showed really nicely."
The unit also has the feel of a townhouse with multiple floors and a street-level entrance, but is stacked on top of another unit within the stucco and plaster building - one of several onsite. "This is a unique complex," the agent says.
There is more than 900 square feet of living space designed with an open principal room on the main floor and the two bedrooms and main bathroom on the second floor. The top level is an outdoor space with a gas hookup.
"The upper units have a rooftop terrace with spectacular views of the city," Ms. Stewart says.
The unit is comes with stainless steel appliances and laundry machines. A monthly fee of $358 pays for 24-hour security and upkeep of common areas, such as the parking garage (the unit has one spot).
Public transit is easily accessible, as are restaurants, a community centre, library, hospital and local theatre.

Another appealing feature, says Ms. [Jane Renwick], is that, on average, new condos in the southern chunk of downtown east are more like boutique structures - offering smaller and more affordable suites in smaller projects.

Full text: Parliament/Queen area has 15,000 new units booked and prices are rising with demand
If you are one of those people always on the lookout for the next big thing, then as far as new condos go it will likely be that area of the city bound by Jarvis to Parliament Streets and from Queen Street south of the Esplanade, give or take a couple of blocks.
Once characterized by its proliferating used furniture and book stores, rooming houses and small pockets of light industry, there were also a handful of mews streets of wonderful turn-of-the-century row houses but not much else to recommend the area to home buyers.
But as more desirable areas such as downtown west started to fill with condos and rents started to rise for commercial enterprises, canny developers started moving east drawn by relatively inexpensive land prices and great public transit.
"It was a bit of a dead zone," says Brad Lamb, of Brad J. Lamb Realty Inc., who is developing projects of his own in the area. "But now it is definitely an area to watch."
One indicator of strong demand is the area's rapid rise in price for square footage, says Jane Renwick, executive vice-president of Urbanation Inc., which tracks the GTA housing market. She says the average for all condos sold to date is about $449 a square foot, while unsold inventory now commands $531 a square foot. What is more, there are nine new condo projects currently under way, plus seven more in the planning stages.
That, however, is only a very tiny tip to the downtown east iceberg. If you include the adjacent west Docklands and waterfront lands, Ms. Renwick says there are 15,597 new condo units in various stages of approval.
"It is the largest area of Toronto for future new development, and because of the city's commitment to the Docklands and waterfront it is certain to include terrific new parks and great public transit," she says.
If Toronto wins its bid for the 2015 Pan American Games, then the area will really heat up, says John Berman, a partner in the redevelopment of the Distillery District at Mill Street and Parliament Street.
"One of the first things to be built will be 6,000 residential suites to house the athletes," he says. "That will go up right next to the Distillery District.
"We already have a streetcar loop to Cherry Street going in. This area is really taking off."
None too soon frankly. In 1980 I bought a 19th century row house on Wascana Avenue, one block north of Queen, running west off River Street. The hope was that the area would soon follow in the path of Cabbagetown. My timing was about 30 years premature.
What the area needed was a new focal point, something so unique that it would draw traffic and interest east.
Eight years ago, Mr. Berman and his partners in Cityscape Development Corp., provided that when they bought the five hectares of land and 45 buildings that ounce housed the Gooderham & Worts distillery.
Today the area boasts 325,000 square feet of commercial space, a quartet of completed condominiums with another two under way. Its restaurants, cafes, theatre and dance companies, boutiques and specialty stores draw in tourists and locals alike. No other neighbourhood in the city looks and feels quite like it.
"There is no question that what we have done had provided a draw for redevelopment," says Mr. Berman. "We supplied that solid eastern anchor the area needed."
Besides, he says, it is a lot easier to get in and out of this neighbourhood than downtown west. The Bayview extension is five minutes away, a quick route to St. Clair or Eglinton. The King and Queen Street streetcars are close by and Lakeshore Boulevard is a 9-iron shot to the south.
Buyers in this neighbourhood also don't have to put up with the noise and traffic congestion common in downtown west as there are fewer clubs and nightspots. Another appealing feature, says Ms. Renwick, is that, on average, new condos in the southern chunk of downtown east are more like boutique structures - offering smaller and more affordable suites in smaller projects. The average number of suites per building is just 232, she says. "They also tend to pop up in small pockets and usually spark an overall gentrification of the immediate neighbourhood." And unlike many other areas of the city, these projects continue to sell, says Mr. Berman. "In the first week of June we sold 10 suites in the two we have on sale now."

Abstract: It's probably the first image that springs to mind when somebody says the magic word "Tuscany": vine-clad hills, a converted farmhouse glowing gold in the setting sun, a poolside glass of ruby-red Chianti. The good news is, it really exists: "Chiantishire" cliches notwithstanding, this swath of Tuscan perfection between Florence and Siena really is all it's cracked up to be.

Full text:   That panoramic, romantic reputation for which the region is famous? It's real - it really does live up to its image. If you go, Lee Marshall writes, you'll want to return again and again
So, you've quaffed the brunello di Montalcino wine. You've drizzled the cold-pressed extra virgin olive oil over the bruschetta. You've seen A Room with a View , Under the Tuscan Sun and that famous photo (there are hundreds, but they're always taken in the same place, from the same angle) of a zigzag row of cypresses carving a mark of Zorro onto a green hillside.
Still you wonder, is Tuscany really a place of fine produce rooted in a ravishing terroir, a landscape of vine-covered slopes and walled villages of handsome stone houses, virtually unchanged since the 14th century, when Ambrogio Lorenzetti painted bucolic scenes of country life into his allegorical frescoes of Good and Bad Government in Siena's Palazzo Pubblico?
Strangely, the answer is yes. This is a region of Italy that really does live up to its image. Sure, there are some modern buildings - even Tuscans need new places to live, shop and play five-a-side football every now and again. But there's an inherent respect for the historical and architectural integrity of town and landscape that, at least outside of the main cities, keeps things looking spruce and painterly. Tuscans have a feel for panoramas - so most hilltop villages will have at least one side (usually the one facing the approach road) that takes the breath away with its untouched purity. The new stuff is dusted away at the back.
Tuscany is also pretty big, however. Not by Canadian standards; but in high-population-density Italy, the four-hour meandering drive from Arezzo to Carrara, from the southeastern province of the region to its northwest corner, is an epic journey that takes one through a slideshow of different landscapes, from the eroded clay, Crete Senesi hills east of Siena to the woods and vineyards of Chianti, the plant nurseries of Pistoia, the deckchair-lined beaches of Viareggio and the marble quarries above Carrara itself, where in 1505 Michelangelo personally supervised the cutting of the huge block intended for Pope Julius II's funerary monument (the Pope later changed his mind, and got the irascible Tuscan artist to give the Sistine Chapel a makeover instead).
With so much on offer, knowing where to head can be a headache. The best approach is to divide Tuscany up by theme. Here are three suggestions:
Wine, walks and wide-open landscapes: the Val d'Orcia
One of the region's six UNESCO protected sites, this stunning valley, dominated by the graceful bulk of Monte Amiata, is rural Tuscany at its most iconic.
One of the best places to view it is from La Foce, a few kilometres west of the town of Chianciano Terme. This huge estate belonged to Marchese Antonio Origo and his Anglo-American wife, Iris; its landscaped garden, laid out by Cecil Pinsent in the 1920s and 1930s, can be visited on Wednesday afternoons from 3 to 7 (see www.lafoce.com for details).
Just beyond La Foce is the Valoresi road, with its famous zigzag line of cypresses. To the north are the twin towns of Montepulciano and Pienza.
The former is a fascinating, archaic place of tight medieval lanes winding up in a sort of DNA helix to the central square, where the duomo houses Taddeo di Bartolo's glorious, lambent Assumption of the Virgin triptych. Along the way, you will have any number of opportunities to buy or sample Montepulciano's celebrated gutsy red vino nobile wine: Producers to look out for include Avignonesi, Poliziano and Salcheto. Pienza is a curious example of a Renaissance new town: Commissioned by Pope Pius II (who was born here), architect Bernardo Rossellino grafted a grand papal palace, central piazza and duomo onto what until then had been a rural village. The architectural equivalent of a mouse that roared, it's a delightful place to while away a few hours. Well-maintained white roads link many of the smaller villages in the area, making this ideal walking and cycling territory.
Churches, beaches and
gardens: Lucca and around
Lucca is one of those mid-sized Tuscan towns that gets it right. It's not just the glorious intactness of the centro storico inside the heavy brick ramparts that enclose and protect it; it's not just the fact that the town has, in San Martino, San Frediano and San Michele in Foro, three of Tuscany's most absorbing Romanesque churches, and in the former Roman amphitheatre of Piazza del Mercato, now lined with medieval houses, one of its most delightful squares. It's the laid-back lifestyle of the lucchesi that really hits home. This is a great place for strolling, or sitting and watching the world go by over a glass of summery vermentino wine. And it's also a good base for excursions. The wild Garfagnana Valley to the north is great walking territory, with several marked trails leading up into the high peaks of the Alpi Apuane and the Orecchiella Natural Park. Northeast of Lucca, a sprinkling of grand villas with splendid formal gardens make for a cultured, panama-hatted and linen-jacketed sightseeing jaunt - Villa Reale at Marlia, Villa Torrigiani at Camigliano, and Villa Garzoni at Collodi (a town also known for its rather dated Pinocchio theme park). And to the west is the sea: not the most crystalline water in the Mediterranean, but it's the beach culture that counts here more than the swim. Head for elegant, palm-lined Viareggio and join the locals for the evening passeggiata , gelato in hand.
Classic Tuscany: from
Chianti to San Gimignano
It's probably the first image that springs to mind when somebody says the magic word "Tuscany": vine-clad hills, a converted farmhouse glowing gold in the setting sun, a poolside glass of ruby-red Chianti. The good news is, it really exists: "Chiantishire" cliches notwithstanding, this swath of Tuscan perfection between Florence and Siena really is all it's cracked up to be. And it's not necessarily an impossibly expensive dream, as with the recession, villa rental prices are stalling and even in some cases coming down. The main towns of Radda, Castellina, Greve and Gaiole are pleasant enough, but they're little more than focal points and useful gas stops in between what really matters: the landscape. For a road trip you'll never forget, get a decent map, locate the medieval abbeys of Badia a Passignano and Badia a Coltibuono - both now important wine estates - and take the scenic secondary roads that join them, via Panzano and Volpaia. You can do it in an hour, but there are so many photo opportunities and tempting trattorias along the way that it could take all day. San Gimignano, a 40-minute drive to the east of the Chianti zone, is famous as Italy's "Medieval Manhattan," with its skyline of defensive towers and its rich 13th- and 14th-century heritage - distilled in the glorious frescoes of the town's venerable cathedral, La Collegiata.
Getting there
Pisa's international airport (www.pisa-airport.com) with regular Delta flights to New York, is the main point of entry. If you're heading to southern Tuscany, Rome Fiumicino (www.adr.it) with direct flights from Canada - including a new Air Canada Montreal route - is just as close. Once in Tuscany, it's best to hire a car; the main companies have booths at all the major airports.

For a road trip you'll never forget, get a decent map, locate the medieval abbeys of Badia a Passignano and Badia a Coltibuono - both now important wine estates - and take the scenic secondary roads that join them, via Panzano and Volpaia. You can do it in an hour, but there are so many photo opportunities and tempting trattorias along the way that it could take all day. San Gimignano, a 40-minute drive to the east of the Chianti zone, is famous as Italy's "Medieval Manhattan," with its skyline of defensive towers and its rich 13th- and 14th-century heritage - distilled in the glorious frescoes of the town's venerable cathedral, La Collegiata.
But try to come out of
season or stay overnight: A victim of its own beauty, San Gimignano is overrun by day trippers from May to September.
Or what about the Piero della Francesca trail around Arezzo? Or the Tuscan cowboy country of the Maremma, down the coast from Grosseto? Or the Mugello Valley north of Florence, famous for wine, porcini mushrooms and Formula 1 racing? The problem with Tuscany is that once you get started, you just don't stop. Italy's most effortlessly cultured region is like the fruit-and-nut-packed panforte cake that wrecks one's diet in Siena: dense, rich and very difficult to leave.
Tuscany is a featured destination on The Globe's Mediterranean Odyssey cruise this August. For more information, visit globeandmail.com/cruise.

GETTING THERE
Pisa's international airport (www.pisa-airport.com) with regular Delta flights to New York, is the main point of entry. If you're heading to southern Tuscany, Rome Fiumicino (www.adr.it) with direct flights from Canada - including a new Air Canada Montreal route - is just as close. Once in Tuscany, it's best to hire a car; the main companies have booths at all the major airports.

Today is the last day of spring, Soccer Day in Canada and the day before Father's Day. Whatever your perspective, you will probably need to visit a hardware store.
CBC begins live coverage of the soccer side of things today at noon with host Scott Russell charting the growth of the sport in Canada. At 1:30 p.m. the Vancouver Whitecaps play Montreal and, more importantly for devotees, at 3:30 p.m. Spain plays South Africa.
Tomorrow, celebrate Dad by letting him kick back, relax and find out everything he ever needed to know about his death-defying sperm. Sound silly? It is.
NOLLYWOOD BABYLON
Saturday, Documentary, 6 p.m.
Fresh from the Sundance festival, this Canadian documentary tells the improbable story of Nollywood, Nigeria's burgeoning movie industry devoted exclusively to straight-to-DVD releases featuring melodramatic plots and poor lighting. The industry operates without studios: entrepreneurial directors, often funded by Christian evangelists, pay previously amateur actors to make quickie action flicks and dramas that they then sell in the Lagos marketplace. These tales of murderous thugs, innocent maidens, money cults and witch doctors are so popular - some fans interviewed here watch up to five a day - that Nollywood is now estimated to be the world's third-largest film industry after those of the U.S. and India. The Christian angle exposes the sadder side of what otherwise might be a cheery tale of African culture beating out Hollywood: These films are often propaganda for a brand of evangelical Christianity that seems to prey on impoverished Nigerians just as voraciously as the witchcraft it denounces.
THE GREAT SPERM RACE
Sunday, Discovery, 8 p.m.
Journalists are instructed to express all figures in terms their audience can visualize, hence all those heights that reach to the moon and areas measured in football fields. The results are often ludicrous, but if you really want to see journalistic metaphors run amok, check out this science doc about human reproduction. It dresses a large cast in white suits and films these "sperm" crossing a mountainous landscape that represents the vagina and battling black-masked goons who represent the female immune response. The sperm die by the millions before a handful of lucky ones find the tiny door that leads to the fallopian tube.
This Canada-U.K. co-pro can't decide whether this is funny (which it is) or serious: Cue the desperate faces of the sperm, the dramatic music - and the giggles. Beneath all this nonsense lurks a highly informative doc full of smart biologists. Just don't let your teenagers watch it: They might come away with the impression that it is hard to get pregnant.
THE ULTIMATE EXPERT CHALLENGE
Sunday, W, 7 p.m.
What is the goal of every reality-show contestant? To get his or her own TV show, of course. W cuts to the chase with this three-part series, running over three Sundays and dedicated to finding a personality capable of hosting his or her own show. The prize is a development deal with W.
The contestants include an engaging nutritionist, an amiable financial expert and five other extremely self-satisfied types who work as an interior designer, a real-estate fluffer, a chef, a hair stylist and a psychologist. In their first challenge, they are asked to prepare a five-minute presentation in their field to show off their communication skills - only to discover that the audience is a bunch of little kids. Pity the poor financial consultant.
Next week, the challenge is to arrange a dinner party to mark an amiable divorce. Fur flies as the experts are forced to pool their skills.
Check local listings.
John Doyle returns on July 23.

Full text: Greg Swann should be happy with what he is seeing in the Phoenix housing market.
Mr. Swann is a real estate agent and, after years of plunging prices and soaring foreclosures, the market is suddenly taking off. Bidding wars have broken out, prices are climbing and buyers are pouring in from all over, including many from Canada.
But Mr. Swann isn't smiling. He's worried. The current buying frenzy "is absurd," he says.
"I really don't like to be a bear because obviously it's not good for my income, but there is no shortage of homes in Phoenix," he said. "We have a false perception of a shortage. ... There is going to be another surge of foreclosed homes on the market, because they are out there."
What's playing out in Phoenix is happening across much of the United States. Eager investors have started snapping up distressed properties, convinced the market has bottomed out and the deals will soon be harder to find.
Those buyers may regret rushing in. There are signs that the problems in the housing sector are far from over, especially as the economy continues to struggle and unemployment rises. At the same time, mortgage rates are climbing, government programs designed to help stop the tide of foreclosures aren't able to keep up and there's a huge number of houses that have yet to hit the market.
At the current pace of sales, it would take 10 months to move all the houses now for sale in the United States. That's about twice as long as it would take in a normal market, said Stan Humphries, vice-president of analytics at Zillow.com, a Seattle-based company that tracks U.S. housing prices.
The problem is, that only counts the houses on the market now. Based on a survey that asked homeowners whether they would sell once the market begins to stabilize, Mr. Humphries said there could be as many as 20 million properties up for sale once prices bottom out. That's a five-year supply.
"We're in for an L-shaped recovery in the housing market, which means we're going to hit a bottom and we're going to stay there, bouncing around, for a while," he said.
That will affect more than just homeowners. Much of the U.S. economy hinges on a recovery in the housing market, where most of the current financial troubles first emerged. Without a rebound in housing, economists fear a lag in consumer confidence and spending, which powers two-thirds of the U.S. economy.
Phoenix offers the most dramatic example of the decline and fall of the housing market. Earlier this year, it became the first U.S. city to see median house prices plunge more than 50 per cent since the peak in 2006. Last month, the median price hit $130,000 (U.S.) - down 42 per cent from a year earlier. In far-flung suburbs such as Buckeye, a newly built, 1,700-square-foot house can be had for $40,000.
Foreclosed properties dominate the market; not that long ago, they accounted for as much as two-thirds of all sales. Many neighbourhoods are lined with vacant houses. In Gilbert, an entire subdivision with 100 lots was recently being sold through foreclosure by the builder.
"Our prices are so low that it's hard to believe," said Diane Olson, a former Winnipegger who sells houses in Phoenix to Canadian clients. "It's the most incredible market I have ever seen."
Those clearance prices have started to attract buyers. Last month, nearly 10,000 houses were sold across Phoenix, up almost 10 per cent from the previous month. Prices also climbed 4 per cent between April and May, the first monthly increase is more than a year.
Buyers now often face bidding wars as soon as a property is listed for sale. Ms. Olson said she recently bid on a house listed at $88,000. She put down an all-cash offer of $110,000 with a two-week closing. "We didn't get it," she said.
Other agents are just as busy. "We have seen a huge increase in buyers," said Tom Caldwell, co-founder of Brewer-Caldwell Property Management Inc. "We're selling 25 to 35 homes a month."
One of Mr. Caldwell's biggest clients is Calgary-based CBI Group, which has created two investment funds and plans to buy about 300 houses in Phoenix. Mr. Swann said he has clients from Canada, California, Oregon and elsewhere snapping up dozens of houses at a time. One investor from Chicago hired another Brewer-Caldwell agent to buy 20 properties.
As demand has surged, the number of foreclosed houses listed for sale has dropped significantly in recent months. Many say that is what has prompted investors to falsely believe the market has hit bottom.
The drop is misleading and temporary, argues Jay Butler, director of realty studies in the Morrison School of Management and Agribusiness at Arizona State University.
Foreclosures were put on hold earlier this year while lenders waited to see the impact of various government-mandated loan-modification and financing programs. Prof. Butler said that hiatus is ending, and most homeowners in Phoenix don't qualify for these programs anyway because the market has sunk too far for banks to bother with loan modifications.
Mr. Swann pointed out that thousands of homeowners will likely walk away from their houses because they owe far more on their mortgages than the properties are worth.
"Say you bought at $260,000 in November, 2005, and you now see homes in your area worth far less. Why pay that mortgage?" he said. "Why not go and rent for a couple of years and then go buy the same house for $140,000?"
Interest rates are another problem. Mortgage rates plunged to record lows in early 2009, helping to make buying more attractive. But now rates are rising because of the resurgent confidence in the global economy.
The rock-bottom mortgage rates of early 2009 were a side effect of the global financial crisis that the plunge in housing started in the first place. In those dark days, with stocks plunging and fear of economic meltdown everywhere, investors flocked to government bonds, driving interest rates to record lows. Mortgage rates - which are based on government bonds - went down in tandem.
Now, with confidence improving, investors are moving money out of the safe havens of government bonds and interest rates are going up. As a result, so are mortgage rates - and fast. The average rate on a 30-year, fixed-rate loan shot up in early June to the highest since November, 5.5 per cent.
The result has been a plunge in the number of mortgage applications to the lowest since November, as fewer Americans asked for loans to refinance their existing houses or buy new ones. On top of that, there are few signs that the U.S. government's measures to stop the tide of foreclosures are doing enough.
About four million mortgages - representing almost 10 per cent of all the U.S. home loans currently outstanding - were delinquent at the end of March, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association. Many of those homeowners ran into problems in the first two waves of the housing crisis, when house prices began to fall and mortgage "teaser" rates were reset higher, making payments unaffordable.
Now, a third wave of defaults is beginning, as even careful borrowers who had been diligent in making payments are falling behind because they've lost their jobs.
The government incentives designed to kick-start the housing market have been unable to keep up. A $75-billion program unveiled in February by U.S. President Barack Obama to help homeowners modify mortgages to avoid foreclosures is off to a slow start, with only about 500,000 mortgages modified as of April, or about one in 10 underwater loans. That's well short of the five million the administration targeted.
While the money is there, the process can take months, the paperwork is extensive and many homeowners, like those in Phoenix, just don't qualify.
Anyone who owes much more than their house is worth isn't eligible, ruling out hundreds of thousands of homeowners who put down little or nothing in the way of a down payment during the boom and have seen their houses plunge in value since the bust.
About 20 per cent of American homeowners now owe more than their house is worth, according to Zillow.com, and the number is growing fast. Just six months ago, the percentage stood at 14.3.
Some incentives are also coming to an end. The current $8,000 U.S. federal tax credit for first-time home buyers is working - 40 per cent of sales are now to first-time buyers - but it is due to expire Dec. 1.
"When people are nervous and concerned about losing their jobs, they are not going to go out and buy homes," said Mr. Humphries of Zillow.com. "These federal programs are well intentioned and, in many cases, I think they are doing some good - they are definitely stimulating demand - but there is a limit to what these kinds of programs can do to overcome a general economic climate that is uncertain."
And if it's all about the economy, it doesn't bode well for Phoenix. About 130,000 jobs have disappeared in the past year in a region with a population of 4.3 million, almost doubling the unemployment rate to 6.8 per cent in April.
With that, there are signs that after decades of surging population growth, the number of people in Phoenix is stagnating, if not dropping, according to an analysis done recently by a local newspaper.
That makes it hard to get excited about the real estate market's supposed signs of life, Prof. Butler said. "I'm not convinced it's worthy of the hype. We're hearing the same verbiage as we did when we were in the hypermarket. They are banking the area will grow again. And a lot people have serious issues with that."

Full text:   'My last three buyers, all three lost their offer because they were in a bidding war,' realtor says, as mortgage rates and prices fall
It was only a few weeks ago that Vancouver realtor Pamela Allen noticed a welcome shift in the market - she began to see bidding wars on resale homes.
"My last three buyers, all three lost their offer because they were in a bidding war," the Re/Max agent said in an interview, adding she has been busier than she has been in months.
"Anything up to $600,000 is flying off the shelves," she said.
Ms. Allen's experience is markedly different from as recently as January, when sales in Vancouver were down 59 per cent from a year earlier. Indeed, prices have dropped, and May sales in Vancouver were 17 per cent above May, 2008, for the first year-over-year gains in months.
Canada's real estate market is clearly on the path to recovery, economists say, citing recent data as evidence that the worst of the slump may be over.
"You're seeing people beginning to kick those tires again in the housing market," said BMO Nesbitt Burns senior economist Michael Gregory.
Many local real estate boards are, for the fourth month in a row, reporting strong sales in May, compared with the previous month.
Observers are watching for a national report on May sales expected today from the Canadian Real Estate Association.
National sales have been rising month over month since February, and in April, for example, sales on a monthly basis jumped 11.2 per cent, seasonally adjusted.
The national market has yet to eke out a year-over-year gain. But economists expect that to change within the next couple of months.
"If you don't get it into positive territory in May, it probably will in June," said Bank of Nova Scotia senior economist Adrienne Warren.
When it does happen, it will mark a sharp rebound from January, when sales were at their lowest point in 10 years.
"The worst of Canada's recession occurred through December and January of this year," Mr. Gregory said. "Things were looking really bleak. It caused people to be cautious."
Now, thanks to low mortgage interest rates and a slide in prices, buyers are more confident, he added.
Most activity is among first-time buyers at the more affordable end of the market, Ms. Warren said. In Calgary, for example, 70 per cent of resales in May were on homes priced under $400,000.
"First-time buyers are coming in to take advantage of the ultra-low interest rates we're seeing right now," Ms. Warren said.
The recent growth is due partly to pent-up demand from the end of last year, and observers said this could level off over the summer once that delayed activity has been satisfied, and as rising unemployment continues to temper consumer activity.
"The worst is over," Mr. Gregory said. "But will the recovery be strong and robust? The jury's still out on that one."

Full text:   An elevated rail line is a strange spot for a park. So how did the High Line go from being a relic to becoming New York's hottest, most inventive public space? Alex Bozikovic heads up above the streets to experience this urban alchemy
Ten metres above 17th Street, carpenters were hammering planks together, electricians were bringing in lighting and gardeners were schlepping in bundles of plants. If you looked up from the construction site, there was New York in the weekday sun: the brick bunkers of the Meatpacking District stepping up to Midtown's cascade of office towers, capped by the Empire State Building. If you looked down, at the bed of an old elevated rail line, you could see leafy plants sprouting up through a carpet of gravel.
And they weren't weeds. Those little shrubs and perennials were crucial pieces in one of the world's most innovative new landscapes: the High Line, a park that blends wild-looking plantings with sculpted concrete in a unique promenade above the streets.
This week, the work was finished as the park's first leg opened to big crowds: visitors and New Yorkers including Edward Norton and Diane von Furstenberg, all lining up and following art-gallery-like rules to check out the water features, public art and views. (Enter at the south end, walk to the north. Don't pick anything. Don't throw anything.)
And one of the men who made it happen, Josh David of the group Friends of the High Line, was as nervous as a new dad. "The park is going to take a beating for the first while," he said in the buildup to the opening. "It's going to be a huge attraction - if we can fit enough tourists up on it."
Overcrowding and movie-star traffic jams aren't an issue at most parks, but the High Line isn't like most parks. "It's like nothing you've ever seen," David says. "You're walking through the ghost of an old railroad line that has been made into a dramatic new park."
It's also a magnet for money and culture. The High Line is a theme park for New York's best contemporary architecture, including the edgy Standard Hotel (which literally straddles the line), a Frank Gehry office building and a wild condo tower by Jean Nouvel. It's a uniquely New York kind of a place - and a work of urban alchemy, transforming a 20th-century industrial artifact for the 21st-century city of culture and tourism - that cities around the world would love to copy.
For visitors, it's a singular experience thanks to the tension between past and present. The High Line is a strange piece of infrastructure, a 1930s workhorse that cuts around and through former warehouses and factories. A decade ago, it was a relic of the old, brawny, industrial New York. But after going quiet in 1980, it went through a surprising evolution.
"The gravel bed had become the base of a self-sown natural landscape," recalls David, who first saw it as a neighbourhood activist in the late 1990s. "Seeds had drifted out of the air. ... It was a lush and beautiful ribbon of grass and meadow flowers and trees."
The memory of that uncultivated, unlikely landscape is part of the park's design, overseen by landscape architecture firm James Corner Field Operations. "The idea was to make a place for people that didn't destroy the very properties that made the High Line such a magical phenomenon," principal James Corner says. "A lot has to do with retaining that quality of wildness and melancholy."
The design proposal includes principles that don't sound very New York-ish: "Keep it simple; keep it wild; keep it quiet; keep it slow."
Original rail tracks were laid back in place and interspersed with new plantings that look like the old, plant life; pathways of delicate concrete ribbing weave across the tracks and between the original elaborate steel railings.
There are also a few architectural wow moments, mostly thanks to New York architects Diller Scofidio + Renfro. At one point, you can relax on a grandstand of sculpted hardwood benches - while hanging vertiginously over 10th Avenue, looking through a big window over the heads of the rushing uptown traffic.
But if the park is a unique lens on the city, it's also a showcase for the work of its lead designer, Corner - a pugnacious Englishman who is now making a park out of an 890-hectare landfill site on Staten Island and designing the 37-kilometre-long Lake Ontario Park on Toronto's waterfront. He's a star in a profession that most people don't understand.
"Landscape is plagued," he says. "You're working with a natural medium, so the genius of artistry and design is often not apparent. Central Park is a classic case in point. People will visit and think it's kind of natural. But it was shaped, it was earth-engineered. Everything in there was designed with a certain artistic vision - which was pretty radical in the 19th century."
Corner's work, like Central Park's Frederick Law Olmsted's, is groundbreaking. A generation ago, cities and planners would have looked at a rail line like this and done one of two things: "Preserve it and make fake history," as Corner puts it, or bring in the wreckers.
The High Line's in-between approach reflects a new set of ideas among landscape architects, who are focusing their efforts on the scars in the fabric of cities - like garbage dumps and railway lines. The park is an instrument to remake the city, aesthetically, environmentally and culturally. "Traces of the old are still evident: the old historical railings, the grassy landscape, the views across New York," Corner says. "But there's also this new landscape and this new social program on top of it."
David saw some of the transition from old to new. In the 1990s, he was a journalist living in Chelsea, the old manufacturing district that was becoming the city's art gallery hub. The High Line was barely visible, sticking out over a street here and there. "It was easy at that time to assume that those little pieces were just remnants," he remembers. But he started digging, and met a neighbour, artist and entrepreneur Robert Hammond, who shared his interest. Eventually the two made the High Line their cause, fighting to save it as Rudy Giuliani's administration moved to have it condemned.
At the same time, this part of the city was rapidly changing. Chelsea was a flashpoint in the bubbling global art market, and the Meatpacking District adjacent to it was becoming a hub for clubs and restaurants. "This, early on, was designated as a nightlife ghetto," hotelier André Balazs says. "There were absolutely no residents around here, and that's how the police wanted it." Suddenly the slaughterhouses were cheek-by-jowl with celebrity hangouts like Pastis and then two hipster-central hotels, Gansevoort Hotel and Soho House.
Balazs wasn't there first - but his hotel, the Standard, would wind up literally on top of the High Line, a chevron-shaped tower teetering on concrete stilts over the park's southern end. "When we started, it wasn't clear there was going to be a High Line," he says, sipping ice water in the garishly red café of his new hotel. Yet as he started creating the Standard, he became one of the park's patrons, and twisted his development project to fit around it.
"Most landlords and developers thought of the High Line as something that had negative value," he recalls, sitting in a 1950s-vintage Arne Jacobsen armchair. "The usual arguments were: How am I going to develop my land when I've got a railroad running through it?"
And then Friends of the High Line, David and Hammond's little project, started to win. Driven by the help of designer von Furstenberg and other celebrity supporters - actor Ed Norton is a long-time advocate - it picked up speed and money, becoming a partner with the city in launching and maintaining the park. They raised $49-million of the first leg's $169-million price tag. All their work, and the whiff of an avant-garde new park, only stirred up the rush of designers, developers and high-end retail, which carried on right into last fall's market crash. (Some of the condos are still going up.)
And the area is only going to get glossier. The Whitney Museum of American Art is building a 185,000-square-foot museum next to the High Line. Designed by Italian architectural star Renzo Piano and slated for a 2012 opening, it's going to make the park even more central to the city's cultural life.
For David, the park is a "an embodiment of the spirit of New Yorkers, to fight when we need to fight." There's that, and a Jane Jacobs-ian dedication to the local - plus a global perspective on design and planning, which took on special importance to all New Yorkers after the loss of the World Trade Center.
All this helped make the High Line happen. "It's rare that you see a public movement gain such momentum so quickly," Balazs says. "But there's a strange amalgam of self-interested parties that got behind it."
Those "parties" definitely include Balazs. The Standard, designed by New York's Polshek Partnership, has a few things going for it: grand public spaces, affordable small rooms, brilliant retro interior design evoking the fizzy modernism of Morris Lapidus.
But most of all, it has a spot on the High Line and killer views in every direction, which no other hotel will be able to match. (The rest of the historic Meatpacking District, right by the Hudson River, is protected from high-rise development.) It's glitzy, brilliant architecture, and - this being New York - a brilliant real-estate deal.
So walk the High Line, then head back to the Standard, ride up to the rooftop bar, order a cocktail and watch the crowds down on the tracks.

Listing agent: Andrea Morrison, Royal LePage Real Estate Services Ltd.
This 1920s house in Bloor West Village has the benefit of a few rare features - such as a private driveway, main floor powder room and open principal rooms - that gave it wide appeal to multiple buyers, agent Andrea Morrison says.
"It had great features, so three people happened to want it at the same time," she says, explaining why a bidding war ensued over the two-storey brick house in March. "The market was just starting to heat up at that point."
In addition, the property was updated recently by replacing most of the windows, lowering the basement floor to create seven-foot ceilings and remodelling the three bathrooms. "It was a stylish renovation," Ms. Morrison says.
The living and dining area has an open concept layout and a breakfast bar separating the kitchen.
The latter was freshened up with hardwood floors - like the rest of this level - maple cabinetry, granite countertops and stainless steel appliances, including a gas stove.
Off the kitchen, there is a deck with a gas barbecue line and a garage.
Upstairs, there is a bathroom and four bedrooms with broadloom covered floors.
Laminate was installed in the recreation room in the basement, which has a separate entrance, bathroom and an office area.
Local amenities include parks, places of worship and shops, as well as the subway.

Full text:   Architect Christopher McCormack was a regular at a beat-up corner store near his Cabbagetown home. When it came up for sale, he jumped at the chance to renovate and restore the local landmark, Deirdre Kelly writes
A20-year resident of Cabbagetown, architect Christopher McCormack was a regular customer of the little Family Mart at the corner of Sackville and Wellesley, a convenient stop for a jug of milk or a loaf of bread. When it closed in 2007, Mr. McCormack's shopping list grew to include the entire store.
"Friends of mine had always said I should take on a personal project that really interests me, to show off what I can do," says Mr. McCormack, whose company McCormack DesignArc specializes in residential home renovation.
"I saw an opportunity when the corner store was closed down to sever it into two and put my own stamp on it as a work of contemporary residential design."
Mr. McCormack bought the property for $585,000 and proceeded to renovate the 1890s general store, aiming to create two loft-style residences, each with its own entrance.
The first of the homes, measuring 1,900 square feet, occupies what used to be the front of the old retail space. It faces north onto Wellesley Street East, its walls of display windows a visual reminder of the property's commercial origins.
The second residence, facing west onto Sackville Street, measures 1,600 square feet and comprises what used to be apartments.
The Wellesley unit sold in April for $940,000, says Mr. McCormack, who lives down the street in a renovated Victorian. The Sackville residence, listed at $839,000, went on the market this week.
The renovation began with the structure being almost entirely gutted. Heritage details on the exterior were saved, among them cast iron pillars and framing.
Where Mr. McCormack added details to the outside - such as a new Victorian-style front porch for the Sackville unit - they were in keeping with the period look of the building.
"The responsibility to renovate the exterior was taken very seriously, given the heritage status of the area," Mr. McCormack says. "We even saved the old Coca-Cola signs, which we are still in the process of restoring, as we want to give them to the new homeowners as gifts."
The result is a building that he calls the area's poster boy for heritage renewal.
For the interior, Mr. McCormack embraced a decidedly 21st-century open concept design.
To keep the living areas open and clean, in both houses he routed all ducting above and below the ground floor, eliminating bulkheads.
In the Wellesley home, he also introduced a built-in bench in the rebuilt store window in the living/kitchen/dining room to hide the heating systems. As well, he removed the corner store's retail floor to accommodate a new floor lifted 16 inches above grade.
This raised the basement ceiling to eight feet, allowing it to be used as additional living space.
Toronto's Space Furniture made the walnut bench, in addition to the bathroom vanities, handrails and tempered glass guards lining a central staircase.
Space also fabricated and installed walnut custom cabinetry in the galley kitchen where the warmth of the wood contrasts with the glint of stainless steel appliances and the European calacatta marble used for countertops.
For the living room, Space also created a large walnut panel for a plasma television that slides ingeniously over a wall of windows, shuttering it for privacy from passersby on the street.
The Sackville home, on the other hand, is more removed from pedestrian traffic, being tucked around the corner and surrounded by old trees. The leafy branches provide a canopy of shade on the new cedar deck located off the 16-by-16-foot master bedroom on the third floor, which used to be an attic.
In this house, the natural wood detailing is cherry. The material bookends the main floor space, where there is kitchen cabinetry on one end and wood panelling centred on the limestone-clad fireplace on the other.
Here, the original ceiling height was 10 feet, eliminating a need to excavate down to its foundations. Structural changes tended toward tearing down walls on the main floor to open up the space, as well as creating a staircase to the finished basement where there is a new three-piece bathroom, one of three in the house.
Mr. McCormack is proud of what he has accomplished, calling it an exercise in urban renewal: "The most environmentally sustainable effort you can do when you are an architect is to renovate an existing building, taking it from near ruin, and reinvigorating it with new life. It's also such a thrill to be able to create a project, soup to nuts."
Pun, no doubt, intended.

A JW MARRIOTT RESORT SPA

ROOMS AND RATES

***
Some would argue that owning a cottage - or at least having regular access to one - is Canadians' God-given right.
But the down-home feel of Ontario's Muskoka region, its landscape honoured in the paintings of the Group of Seven, was long ago traded in for ultra-manicured golf courses, antique shops and gigantic "cottages" that are more like castles. If that real estate is out of reach - or friends' invitations are not forthcoming - there's the new Rosseau, Canada's first location of the Marriott's upscale JW Marriott resort brand.
Built atop a 100-foot granite bluff overlooking Lake Rosseau, the 221-room condo-
hotel dominates the landscape. Located on the site of what was a mom-and-pop cottage resort, the four-season Rosseau is part of Red Leaves, a full-service resort and condo community.
(It's separately owned from the rest of the development, which became an issue recently when the hotel went into receivership; since it's still being run by Marriott, the hotel says it's business as usual for guests, though the landscaping will now be finished.)
It may be part of a big development, but the hotel pays tribute to its locale. The main floor library is stocked with Canadian and cottaging literature, while artistic touches pay homage to Muskoka (a local gallery chose much of the art on display throughout the hotel, including replica models of paddle wheelers that once plied the region's waterways).
Location About a 2½-hour drive from Toronto. Lake Rosseau is connected to Lake Joseph.
Ambience Boutique cabin. The resort is swank without much gilding, following
the philosophy of the JW Marriott brand. You can
easily make the transition from a demanding paddle in North Face attire to dining with your best weekend
sprezzatura.
Clientele Well-to-do outdoorsy types share the lounge with nanny-toting young families and chess-playing retired couples. Upon arrival in winter, you might see a line of 15 parked Ski-Doos in the parking lot, while a new Range Rover pulls up for valet service. It's so Muskoka.
Design Hotel designer Frank Nicholson (who has shaped the style of many Ritz Carlton and Four Seasons hotels) includes all the bling of today's deluxe hotels on the inside, but maintains the feel of grand old Muskoka lodges on the outside. If they were building Château Montebello today, it would look a lot like this.
The rooms, all painted in pleasing greens or yellows, feature pine-cone and oak-leaf light fixtures, adding whimsy to the cottage theme. Instead of generic hotel-art prints, rooms feature Muskoka lake photography: men reclining in motorboats, autumn lake scenes and plenty of red
maple leaves.
Rooms The Rosseau, which is run as a condo hotel, offers single studios, as well as one- and two-bedroom suites.
The two-bedroom suites are especially nice for parents, who don't have to tiptoe around once the kids are asleep. Solid-core doors throughout the resort keep it quiet anyway, so you don't have to worry that the kids' roughhousing will bother the neighbours.
Many rooms have views of the lake and patios, and all rooms feature a gas fireplace, flat-screen TV and soaker tubs. Even the single studios boast a galley kitchen with Sub-Zero appliances. Beds are also topped with down mattress covers.
Amenities There's a private beach and 700-acre nature reserve to explore. Down the road at Wallace Marina, you can rent gear for outdoor activities - cross-country skiing and snowshoeing in winter and boating and fishing in summer.
Nearby, golfers can take on The Rock, a course designed by Nick Faldo and operated by Marriott Golf.
Service There's a friendly, local vibe here, almost like entering a resort town. Staff, from the front desk to the cleaning crew, offer warm smiles. The valets are attentive and remember your and your kids' names.
Food and Drink The main restaurant, Cottages, strives to serve Ontario-grown and -raised cuisine, including pan-fried Milford Bay trout. The kids' menu boasts everything from grilled petite steak with mashed potatoes and veggies to "Mom's chocolate pudding."
Teca, with its boutique-grotto feel, features Italian cuisine. And the lobby bar, Lakes, has an unusual menu that is divided according to timeline: 5-, 10- and 20-minute "Little Bites." That way, you won't miss your guided astronomy tour or canoe ride while waiting to refuel.
Things to Do On any given weekend, you can sign up for art classes and lectures (led by Pat Fairhead, who was taught by Franklin Carmichael of the Group of Seven) or yoga classes.
Guide and naturalist Robin Tapley adds value to hikes with lessons on loons, mushroom foraging or astronomy. And there is a wide range of other activities available through Red Leaves, including horseback riding and geocaching.
Of course, boating is a big part of the Muskoka experience, and boat rentals, waterskiing and cruises are available.

TOP DRAW
The interpretive work of guide Robin Tapley helps guests make the most of their Muskoka visit.
NEEDS WORK
Exterior construction - such as a cabana and docks, as well as some landscaping - that the hotel says will be finished in July.
Bottom Line
If you're sick of not getting invites to your friends' Muskoka cottages or want to live like Kurt and Goldie for a bit, come.

Full text:   Facing unprecedented demand for loans as recession hits developing countries, bank to ask Ottawa to boost aid
The World Bank is fast running out of funds to lend to poor countries, presenting the richer nations that control the bank with a new demand for cash just as alarms are being sounded at home over the high cost of fighting the financial crisis.
World Bank president Robert Zoellick will be in Ottawa tomorrow, asking Prime Minister Stephen Harper, Finance Minister Jim Flaherty, Opposition Leader Michael Ignatieff and other legislators to loosen the purse strings as it grapples with an unprecedented demand for aid.
"If the demand for our lending stays at the pace it looks like it is going to be at, it is more likely than not that we will need some sort of increase," Mr. Zoellick said in a recent interview from Washington.
While the Conservative government has already boosted support for other international development agencies, that was before the cost of rescuing General Motors Corp. and Chrysler LLC, and higher-than-expected employment insurance payments, pushed the budget deficit to record levels. The news of a more than $50-billion shortfall has become a flashpoint for criticism of the government's handling of the financial crisis.
In April, Canada, the United States, Germany and other major stakeholders gave Mr. Zoellick the green light to max out the bank's reserves in order to make loans of up to $100-billion (U.S.) over the next three years. They also asked him to determine whether that would be enough to see the poorest countries through the global recession and report back in October. Mr. Zoellick said he is pretty sure he will be looking for more money.
The Harper government has already committed $200-million (Canadian) to a World Bank fund to back poor countries' exports. Canada has also boosted its stake in the International Monetary Fund, doubled its contribution to the Inter-American Development Bank and pledged another $179-million for the Asian Development Bank.
Stephanie Rubec, a spokeswoman for the federal Finance Department, said Canada and its partners in the Group of 20 economic powers "will continue to review the needs of the institutions in the coming months."
Mr. Zoellick acknowledged that it's "a challenge" to get the developed countries to consider the needs of others at the same time their own unemployment rates and debt levels are fast rising.
Demand for World Bank loans over the next year or more appears likely to be "very, very high" because the ripples from the global recession are only now being seriously felt in Africa and other poorer regions, Mr. Zoellick said.
It's too soon to say for sure how much the World Bank might need to prevent infrastructure, health and education programs in Africa, Latin America and other regions from failing, he said.
Conditions are deteriorating for the world's developing countries just as economic indicators in richer countries indicate the worst of the global recession is over.
The financial crisis is unfolding differently in poorer parts of the world. In the United States and Europe, the recession started in the banking sector and spread to the real economy. In developing countries, the collapse of global trade is crushing growth prospects, which is hurting their banks because clients are defaulting on loans.
This situation creates a vicious circle that is exacerbated by the lack of unemployment insurance and social programs in such regions, for example, as sub-Saharan Africa. Poorer countries tend to be more reliant on exporting commodities, so they are dealt a greater blow by declining world demand. Remittances are falling quickly because the workers who went abroad to send money back to their families are losing their jobs and being sent home.
"In sub-Saharan Africa, you have no cushion," Mr. Zoellick said. "The harsh reality is they will feed the boy before the girl, that if they have some ability to keep someone in school, they will keep the boy and not the girl."
Mr. Zoellick was complimentary of Canada's efforts, praising Mr. Harper as someone who "knows what he is talking about in economics" and Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney for doing "a very good job in the central banking world."
In fact, the World Bank chief said he holds Canada up as an example to others.
The bank's trade finance fund to which Canada has already contributed is still short of the G20's goal by about $1.5-billion (U.S.), Mr. Zoellick said. The idea is to raise pledges of about $5-billion to finance trade worth $50-billion over the next three years.
To get others to join, Mr. Zoellick will appeal to their self interest. The trade finance fund will lift demand for the goods Canada and other trading nations produce, giving them potential markets to replace the struggling American consumer.
"We need to build multiple poles of growth," Mr. Zoellick said. "There is a self interest for economic health."
****
Road is still bumpy
World Bank president Robert Zoellick isn't ready to call an end to the recession. "There are positive vibrations coming out of financial markets in the near term, but I think there are still large uncertainties in the real economy," he said.
THE BANKS
Yes, the Obama administration has a program to get the toxic assets off the banks' books. But it's still early. Mr. Zoellick said he is wary of "second- and third-round effects" from exposure to consumer and credit-card debt. Commercial real estate is shaky and markets for securitized debt remain weak, he said.
PROTECTIONISM
As unemployment rises, there's going to be increasing pressure on politicians to curry favour with local companies.
Central and Eastern
EUROPE
More than other emerging markets, the former Soviet countries relied on foreign investment and Western European banks to finance their pre-crisis booms. That money is now in retreat.
Private lending in emerging markets
The World Bank estimates that emerging markets are facing a "financing gap" of between $370-billion (U.S.) and $700-billion as risk-averse hedge funds in rich countries and other private lenders invest closer to home.
THE X FACTOR
"The thing that you never see until it hits you," Mr. Zoellick said, citing the outbreak of swine flu as an example.

Full text:   All that's left of Duke's Cycle and its neighbours on Queen Street West is a post-Blitz-like field of rubble, punctuated by jagged piles of beaten wooden beams, rusted metal and chunks of red brick.
The only sign there was a bike shop here for almost 100 years is a few black scraps of what used to be bicycle tires lying in the dirt. The store, along with several other businesses in a dilapidated but historic strip near Bathurst Street, was destroyed in a massive fire in February of 2008.
That was bad enough, says Gary Duke, the owner of the bike shop who has temporarily relocated his business to Richmond Street. But he says what has happened since - at the hands of city officials and the province's property tax assessment corporation - has compounded the devastation wrought by the flames of last year.
Not only did the city slip his family a bill for $33,000 for the demolition and cleanup of their fire-ravaged property, which he calls an "outrage." But with the old building torn down, the city's grandfathered property-tax discount for these small businesses, now a vacant lot of prime downtown real estate, also went up in smoke.
That part of the rubble still owned by Mr. Duke's parents, who are now in their mid-80s, has seen its annual property tax bill almost double, from $12,000 a year before the fire to $22,000 a year today, Mr. Duke said, even after he applied for a reduction since it is a vacant lot earning his family nothing.
Worse, if he and his family go ahead and rebuild their store - which had been there since 1914, started by his grandfather - Mr. Duke believes his property tax would double again. And efforts to rebuild are hampered, he said, by the province's demand that an archeological study take place first.
"It's just another kick in the private parts," Mr. Duke said, accusing the city of being "heartless."
The local city councillor, Adam Vaughan, (Ward 20, Trinity Spadina), has called for a cap on the new taxes or for special grants to offset them, if the businesses are rebuilt as they were before the fire. He says leaving the rules as is will mean only large corporate chain stores will be able to afford to locate in the rebuilt strip.
Mr. Vaughan said the situation was absurd: "City hall shouldn't profit from the tragedy and misfortune of small business in the city ... Let's not take advantage of a fire, and let's not use a fire to bankrupt families that have been paying taxes for years."
But city bureaucrats have warned against any special treatment for the six properties destroyed. They say offering special grants or tax breaks could set a precedent that would force the city to ease the burdens on other retail strips that redevelop, potentially costing the city millions in tax revenue.
"It just may be seen by other members of council as a device that they could use for areas in their ward or that sort of thing," said Peter Moore of the city's planning department. "It's very difficult to control the process when that starts to happen."
As to the $33,000 bill for what Mr. Duke called a fee for the investigation of the fire, the city says it is charging all six property owners a total of $204,600 to cover the costs of a contractor who demolished the remaining burnt-out structures and removed the debris required to make the site safe for fire investigators.
According to a staff report, if the bills are not paid, the city could place a lien on the properties, making it harder for the owners to get loans or sell the land.
The issue of how to help the Queen Street property owners was referred to the planning department for further study by Mayor David Miller's executive committee meeting last week.
Councillor Howard Moscoe (Ward 15, Eglinton-Lawrence) and others on the committee said they were concerned about bending city policy on tax incentives to apply to retail developments, as the limited policy is supposed to be used only to attract high-tech or high-skilled jobs, or for large so-called "transformative" projects.

Full text: LET HIM BE
Written and directed
by Peter McNamee
Starring Kathleen Munroe,
Sean Clement, Mark Staycer
and Graham Wignall
Classification: 14A
**
Is John Lennon alive and well and living in rural Ontario? That's the question an obsessed film undergrad and his reluctant girlfriend set out to answer in Let Him Be , a flawed but earnest and sometimes engaging low-budget feature by Peter McNamee that did a spin through a handful of Canadian festivals last year.
Tim (Sean Clement), an aspiring documentarian who repairs used gear to make a few extra bucks, finds a tape left in a video camera his father bought at a yard sale on his way home from a fishing trip. The tape contains footage of a guy with long hair, a hooked nose and wire-framed glasses strumming and singing at a kid's party - he looks and sounds remarkably like John Lennon, albeit older than when he was last seen alive. After researching conspiracy theories, Tim convinces himself Lennon survived the murder attempt and escaped to Canada, for which he was known to have great affection.
With visions of hitting the big time if he can break this "story," Tim convinces his live-in girlfriend Kathleen (Kathleen Munroe), also an aspiring filmmaker, to spend a weekend with him searching cottage country north of Toronto for hard evidence. Quite conveniently, Tim's father remembers the area where he bought the video camera, and Tim's uncle, who sells surveillance equipment, lends him a ton of high-tech stealth gear.
The students eventually find a small town that yields results. Introducing themselves as filmmakers shooting a documentary about small-town life, they interview a shopkeeper and local musicians who jam with a songwriter called Noel Snow (Mark Staycer), a chain-smoking, semi-reclusive fellow who lives on a posh estate with Stanley (Graham Wignall), a Brit of the same vintage. Tim's theory is starting to look good.
Kathleen remains skeptical but agrees to stay on longer. While Tim breaks into the house and sets up hidden cameras that feed footage back to a computer, Kathleen plays lookout. Then Noel and Stanley drive by and invite her back to the house. She starts visiting Noel every day, going for long walks, reading books he recommends and listening to his very Lennon-esque original songs. Tim hides in the bushes filming them, and (mostly) hangs out in his makeshift headquarters with the blinds drawn, watching the collected footage for evidence that Noel is John - and completely missing Kathleen's growing affection for the guy.
This goes on for a month, which is, well, preposterous.
Let Him Be is constructed like a documentary Tim has assembled from the footage, and it relies too heavily on voiceover for explanation. Throughout the film we're asked to swallow too many coincidences for the story to proceed. The pair's ruse is overly complex, and it's difficult to believe the film students don't get caught - especially in a small town whose inhabitants are portrayed as intelligent people.
Still, the film has its qualities. Among them: Staycer holds your attention as the older Lennon look-alike, and many of the polished original songs (co-written by McNamee) have both the melodic and lyrical qualities of Lennon's solo music.

Listing agent: Marlene McLean, Re/Max Professionals Inc.
This two-bedroom penthouse is located in an intimate five-storey condominium on a busy street. Yet it has a tranquil setting, situated at the back of the building, explains agent Marlene McLean.
"It looked over Riverside Drive, which is a very quiet, residential enclave," she says. "And it was above the treetops, so it was a picturesque, serene view."
One of the best places to enjoy the landscape is from a wraparound terrace with sight lines to the south and west, as well as space for tables, chairs and potted trees. "The 710-square-foot terrace was breathtaking," says Ms. McLean. "It's larger than most in this price point."
Furthermore, there are walkouts from nearly every room of the 1,625-square-foot suite, including the master suite and eat-in kitchen. The former contains a five-piece marble bathroom, walk-in closet and laminate floors, while the latter features ceramic floors and stainless steel appliances.
The L-shaped living and dining area is polished off with ceiling speakers and decorative columns, along with upgraded hardwood floors, crown mouldings and a gas fireplace.
"It really allowed for comfortable living, but also wonderful entertaining space," says Ms. McLean of the unit's spacious and sought after layout. "We haven't seen a penthouse in this building for about five-years or so."
The unit comes with another full bathroom, a built-in Murphy bed in the second bedroom, and a laundry area with built-in cabinetry, in addition to a locker and two parking spots. Cable is included in the monthly fee of $991.
Residents have access to a games room, gym and a main floor party room with a kitchen, patio and barbecue. "It's wonderful if you wanted to do larger group entertaining," adds Ms. McLean.
Alternatively, local amenities, include Humber River parklands and Bloor West Village shops. "You can walk to everything, including the subway, which is desirable," says Ms. McLean.

Listing agent: Jerry Hammond, Re/Max Ultimate
Realty Inc.
The value of this Mediterranean-style estate lies in its premium location on a spacious lot backing onto about 150 acres of parkland in the prestigious Bridle Path community, says agent Jerry Hammond.
"You had panoramic views of the park," he says referring to the popular Sunnybrook Park just beyond the south-facing backyard. "It was beautiful."
The picturesque neighbourhood is also home to Edwards Gardens, the Granite Club and acclaimed private schools.
In terms of the property's physical charm, buyers were impressed by its larger-than-average floor plan - measuring over 6,000 square feet - which local architect Richard Wengle custom-designed for the previous owner.
"He has a great reputation in the architecture world," says Mr. Hammond. "He does what the client wishes."
For instance, this stately seven-bedroom residence has many unique and desirable attributes, such as a built-in four-car garage and marble flooring in the foyer and living and dining rooms. "The master bedroom is on the main floor, which is also not typical of homes in Toronto," adds Mr. Hammond.
An elevator easily shuttles residents to the second floor, where two out of five bedrooms are separate suites containing kitchen facilities and family rooms.
With a total of 10 bathrooms in the house, each bedroom has a private ensuite, including the two lower-level bedrooms.
A sample of notable finishes include arched doorways in the main hall, coffered ceilings in the library and granite-topped counters and island in the main eat-in kitchen.

Too hip, too fast: City puts brakes on Ossington development

Abstract: "Bars and restaurants have organically just popped up," said Saeed Mohamed, owner of Burger Shoppe Quality Meats. "I don't think you can legislate how a street develops, you know?"I think it's hypocritical. [We] cleaned it up too fast and now it's like 'whoa, stop it,' " added Mr. [Michael Homewood].

Full text: Michael Homewood remembers the way Ossington Avenue used to be.
Rundown industrial buildings, a string of sketchy bars and karaoke joints, and a reputation for violence were the strip's defining characteristics.
"When I moved in here two years ago, people thought I was crazy because you couldn't walk down the street at night," he said.
Since then, the strip has undergone a renaissance. More than a dozen restaurants and bars, including Mr. Homewood's Baby Huey lounge, have opened and flourished. The violence has died down.
That's why Mr. Homewood and others were surprised when the city hit the brakes on Ossington's hot streak.
In a last-minute bylaw introduced and passed Tuesday, the city slapped a one-year moratorium on new bars and restaurants opening along the street. Local councillor Joe Pantalone said he fears the strip is growing too quickly.
"There is 'hot' area and a 'burning' area. We don't mind hot, but we don't want to be burned," he said.
Many of the business owners who spearheaded the redevelopment are perplexed, wondering why city bureaucrats are sticking their noses into the affairs of a strip that has picked itself up on its own.
"Bars and restaurants have organically just popped up," said Saeed Mohamed, owner of Burger Shoppe Quality Meats. "I don't think you can legislate how a street develops, you know?"I think it's hypocritical. [We] cleaned it up too fast and now it's like 'whoa, stop it,' " added Mr. Homewood.
The new bylaw took effect immediately. Businesses which already have applied for liquor licences and building permits are not affected.
Mr. Pantalone said some residents and businesses have expressed "angst" that Entertainment District-type clubs could open along the street.
The same fears led to a similar moratorium years ago on College Street, between Bathurst and Ossington, which he said balanced out that neighbourhood's residential and commercial interests.
"That is the balance we are trying to achieve on Ossington," he said.
The new Ossington bylaw applies only between Queen and Dundas, the heart of the street's rebirth.
The strip's eateries are small, and many open only in the evenings.
Most business owners know each other by name, have formed an informal Business Improvement Area, and don't want flashy new lounges in their tightly knit community.
"There's a bit of a fear of nightclubs down here," said Pol Cristo-Williams, 33, owner of Sweaty Betty's bar, one of the pillars of the new Ossington.
"We want it to be a cool little neighbourhood, because it already is."
There's no shortage of opinion about the moratorium - suggesting a community meeting planned for tonight at a Dundas and Ossington church will be a busy one.
"I applaud Mr. Pantalone for supporting the neighbourhood in that effect," said Jason MacIsaac, owner of the Ministry of the Interior boutique. "Because this isn't really an Entertainment District."
"It can't happen here," countered Mr. Homewood, in a separate interview.
"The places aren't big enough. Where are you going to be able to put a 3,000-person bar on Ossington?"
Ossington's development has driven property prices up anyway, business owners say, acting as a de facto moratorium to some of the smaller businesses that might have taken advantage of cheap lease rates two years ago.
And it's not just businesses. At Queen and Ossington, a residential loft development is selling at between $400 and $500 per square foot.
It's one "of the hottest areas in town," said Yossi Kaplan, a real estate agent who represented some of those loft buyers.
"The gentrification process is far from over. Far, far from over. That's just the tip of the iceberg for that area."
Anthony Siniscalco, 28, is preparing to open an art gallery and lounge, dubbed Gallery, within two months along Ossington, having filed his applications before the new bylaw, which he called "sad."
"Toronto needs areas like this.
"Five years ago there were shootings on Ossington," he said. "And now look at it."
With a report from Jennifer Lewington

What locals say
* "Some of the people are afraid some of the [downtown] club owners are coming to open massive clubs. But the reality is there are no places on Ossington that someone could actually put a big bar in." - Saeed Mohamed, owner, Burger Shoppe Quality Meats * "I remember not being able to get home because of all the shootings. ... I think it's possibly a wise choice for the city to [pass the bylaw]. That's long-term thinking.
"The other thing to remember is those [liquor] licences were already here. They were just tied up in Vietnamese bars and restaurants." - Pol Cristo-Williams, owner of Sweaty Betty's * "In the last few months, I really felt that they're dumping those [new bars] here. There was a tipping point a few months ago where it was like, wow this street has really changed."
- Jason MacIsaac, owner, Ministry of the Interior
* "We need this in Toronto. We can't just rely on a couple [of] strips - Entertainment District, King Street West, and Yorkville - to be our landmark areas."
- Anthony Siniscalco, owner, Gallery lounge
* "My hope is that a balance can be established on Ossington Avenue which will maintain it as a hot and desirable area ... while at the same time ensuring that the neighbourhood has a degree of protection and quality of life."
- Joe Pantalone, deputy mayor and local councillor
* "I would bet my chips on [the continued development of] that area, rather than going to Leslieville."

Full text: Transactions such as Bentall V show sellers can get 'true market value' even as property prices suffer elsewhere
Despite tough economic times, Vancouver continues to attract investors eager for a slice of the city's tight downtown core.
Last week's $300-million purchase of the Bentall V office building by Germany's DekaBank GmbH from SITQ, a real estate subsidiary of the Caisse de depôt et placement du Quebec, was the biggest and most prominent transaction, but part of a trend that has seen at least a half a dozen downtown office buildings change hands this year.
"We probably have an office market here that's the envy of any major market on the planet," says CB Richard Ellis broker Tony Quattrin, who handled the Bentall V sale with partner Jim Szabo on behalf of DekaBank. "Investors are turning to solid fundamentals in Vancouver and buying downtown office [space], which is probably the strongest of all investment markets in the country."
Indeed, Vancouver was picked as the best investment market in North America by the Washington-based Urban Land Institute last fall.
But rising vacancies in recent months have squeezed cash flows at many properties and boosted downward pressure on property values.
CB Richard Ellis research finds that Metro Vancouver's office market has seen two successive quarters of rising vacancies - something that has not happened since the dark days following the collapse of the tech boom in 2001.
This pushed office vacancy rates to 4.2 per cent in the downtown core in the first quarter of this year, up from 2.3 per cent at the end of the third quarter of 2008, and 7.2 per cent region-wide, up from 5.4 per cent.
This is creating opportunities for investors, with CBRE statistics indicating that capitalization rates - an industry measure of anticipated yield - have risen to 6 per cent to 7 per cent today, after dipping to 5 per cent to 6 per cent at the height of the market a couple of years ago.
Still, Vancouver's market remains tight, with its downtown vacancy rate the second lowest in the country and still several percentage points below what experts say it would take to become a balanced market.
While some tenants have returned space to the market in a bid to cut costs - pushing up sublease rates to 1.8 per cent in the downtown core, according to Colliers International - the properties Mr. Quattrin and Mr. Szabo have been handling are all fully leased, a testament to the strength of the local market.
This was especially true in the case of Bentall V, where Bell Canada, Teck Resources Ltd. and Teekay Corp. are part of a blue-chip roster of companies that aren't about to leave the downtown core. Over all, just 3 per cent of the leases at Bentall V will expire within the next three years, meaning the 553,000-square-foot property promises a stable cash flow to its new owner.
Still, Mr. Quattrin notes that a deal of such magnitude is rare in the current market. Many prospective buyers are looking for deeply discounted assets from motivated sellers, but the offer for Bentall V was unsolicited.
"It's quite an anomaly to see a deal of this magnitude trade at a true market value," Mr. Quattrin says. "To make a gamble on Vancouver and then to pay what is really a fair market price for a building of this calibre and quality that rarely becomes available is quite rare."
Among the other deals this year, Oxford Properties Group Inc., owned by pension fund Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System, recently sold a third of its interest in 1138 Melville St., a 158,000-square-foot office tower two blocks from Bentall V, to an undisclosed buyer for $80-million. And LaSalle Investment Management purchased 1045 Howe St., a B-class tower, at the beginning of this year from a private local investor for $33-million.
Vancouver-based real estate company Grosvenor Americas Ltd. has also agreed to sell 1040 West Georgia St., just around the corner from Bentall V, to a company owned by Vancouver investor Joseph Segal, though details haven't been disclosed pending closing of the deal.
David Eger, senior director of research, valuation and advisory with the real estate consulting firm Altus Group in Vancouver, says the recent deal making is unusual for the Vancouver market. "I don't know if we'll ever see that again, to see two fairly prestigious properties sell fairly quickly," he says, referring to Bentall V and 1040 West Georgia.
The spate of transactions this year should help to provide a better guide to local market values. The most recent deal to rival the Bentall V transaction in size was Cadillac Fairview Corp.'s purchase of the HSBC Building at 885 West Georgia St. for $140-million in 2005.
The Bentall sale also sends a strong message about future prospects, says Jeff Rank, managing director of Cushman & Wakefield LePage in Vancouver, which is handling the sale of the Grosvenor property. He says two other major office properties, which he wouldn't identify, could come on to the market in the coming months, as owners try to tap into the demand for local assets.
And, since no major additions of downtown office space are expected before 2014, Mr. Rank believes Vancouver will weather the downturn better than other cities where major towers are on the go, such as Calgary and Edmonton.
"People [are] looking at this market and seeing that there is liquidity here and the ability to sell and some of the larger owners with properties across the country or in various countries are looking at Vancouver as somewhere where [they] can still fetch a pretty good dollar versus other markets," he says.

Full text: awillis@globeandmail.com
Judging by their track records, the money managers calling the shots at CanWest Global Communications Corp. CGS-T are willing to take on radical restructuring of the media company to fix its debt-heavy balance sheet.
CanWest received a $100-million loan Wednesday from a trio of hedge funds that own the company's bonds, and another $75-million from distressed lender CIT Business Credit Canada.
The bond holders and CIT are now working with CanWest executives on a restructuring plan that is expected to be agreed upon, in principle, by June 15. One source familiar with scenarios on the table say they involve a debt-for-equity swap that would leave only a token amount of equity ("a tip") for the Asper family, which currently controls CanWest, and other shareholders.
The three funds that put new money into CanWest are veteran players in what's known as the distressed debt sector: They try to fix companies with busted balance sheets. There are two U.S. funds, GoldenTree Asset Management and Beach Point Capital Management; and a Toronto-based fund, West Face Capital.
The trio have taken the dominant position among CanWest's creditors by paying off all the parent company's bank loans.
Working with law firm Goodmans, the funds will now work on a restructuring plan with CanWest that will likely include further cost cutting, new leadership for the TV and newspaper company, and a possible prepackaged filing for creditor protection. This is familiar territory for all three funds.
West Face provides the Canadian content needed by any group that wants to control media assets in this country. Partners in the fund, which was founded by financier Greg Boland, are not strangers to using bankruptcy laws to their best advantage, as a predecessor to West Face helped in the lucrative refinancing of Stelco during the steel maker's trip through creditor protection.
New York-based GoldenTree, which has $10-billion (U.S.) in assets, is a nine-year-old fund with holdings in a number of sectors that have been hit hard by the recession. The portfolio includes several media plays, along with auto financiers and power companies.
GoldenTree, founded by a former junk bond fund manager named Steven Tananbaum, owns a stake in Texas-based television company Belo Corp., according to regulatory filings. Belo spun out its newspaper division as a separate, publicly traded company last year; titles include The Dallas Morning News.
Belo is in the midst of a cost-cutting drive that included suspending its common share dividend, cutting management salaries and halting contributions to employees' 401(K) pension plans.
GoldenTree also has a stake in Liberty Global, an international cable company.
Beach Point Capital was born in January, when it was spun out of a large U.S. insurance company, Principal Financial. The Los Angeles-based fund has $3-billion in assets under management, and the co-founders are former lawyer Scott Klein and former accountant Carl Goldsmith.
Mr. Klein is a 17-year veteran of distress debt markets, and a former bankruptcy attorney at the San Francisco law firm Murphy Weir and Butler.
Mr. Goldsmith is also a veteran high-yield bond investor; he started his career at PricewaterhouseCoopers, where he was part of the workout department, advising debtors and creditors in bankruptcy restructurings.
ONEX'S SPIRIT SECRET
As the formal part of the Onex Corp. OCX-T annual meeting wound down yesterday, and the lights went up, chairman Gerry Schwartz asked whether anyone had questions.
"I believe there is someone here from Wichita who has something to say," said Mr. Schwartz, as a woman advanced on the microphone with that same aggressive swagger we saw from Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail. This is where CEOs typically get sweaty palms, as they prepare to defend their compensation.
"My name is Donna Castaneda, and I represent SPEEA Local 2001," said the questioner. That would be the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace, the union that represents workers at aircraft parts manufacturer Spirit AeroSystems Holdings SPR-N of Kansas, one of 26 companies in Onex's portfolio.
Here come the fireworks, figured at least one member of the audience. Oppressed worker versus arch-capitalist. Class warfare, dressed up as corporate theatre.
"I just want to thank everyone here at Onex for their support over the past four-plus years," Ms. Castaneda began. (Okay, maybe she's building up to the rant.) "I want you to know that everyone is working hard to create and grow Spirit into the global leader in aerospace," she continued, explaining that the latest round of negotiations between worker and oppressor (okay, she said management) is going well.
"We're as appreciative of your work as you are of ours," replied Mr. Schwartz. Then he took a moment to pitch the merits of Spirit's proposed performance-based compensation scheme.
After months of watching auto unions knock heads with auto executives, and the general breakdown in the bond between employees and executives that has come in this economic meltdown, the love-in seemed surreal.
This is the secret sauce in Onex's approach to private equity: As owners, the company works at support and alignment not only with the management of its companies, but also with the rank and file.
"It is night and day working at the company under Onex, versus what it used to be under Boeing," Ms. Castaneda said in an interview after the meeting, adding that she now owns shares in both Spirit and Onex.
Onex bought Spirit in 2005, for $1.5-billion (U.S.), when it was a collection of unwanted Boeing factories, and has since transformed the parts maker into a key supplier for most of the world's aircraft manufacturers.
After the meeting, Mr. Schwartz said the union relationships extend beyond the workplace: Several union-sponsored pension plans have put money into Onex's external funds, which now run to $6.5-billion.
And the secret sauce is being applied to Onex's latest venture, a controlling stake in the Tropicana Resort & Casino.
Onex bought the venerable but tired property - on 34 acres of prime Las Vegas real estate - by purchasing secured loans for $200-million (Canadian). The plan is to spend up to $125-million, financed by a rights offerings, sprucing up each room, the hotel restaurants and the casino, under the direction of former MGM Mirage executive Alex Yemenidjian.
Mr. Schwartz said in an interview that the strategy for Tropicana also includes working closely with the hotel's unionized work force to improve the quality of service in every part of the property. Down the road, it may be blackjack dealers who stand up at the Onex annual meeting to pay tribute to the company.

Til Debt Do Us Part
Slice, 7:30 p.m.
Since the onset of hard economic times, the normally frilly lifestyle channel has been filling entire prime-time program blocks with marathon airings of this series in which savvy money planner Gail Vaz-Oxlade dispenses common-sense advice to Canadian couples drowning in debt. In tonight's first show, she examines the financial records of Gail and Tony, whose entire social life revolves around show cars. The costly hobby has the pair on the brink of personal bankruptcy, before Ms. Vaz-Oxlade steps in. Six more episodes follow.
Drama
Flashpoint
CBS, CTV, 9 p.m.
The sharp Canadian-made police drama takes a break from airing new shows, starting with tonight's standout episode from last season. A young man named Michael Jamieson (Mpho Koaho) is finally vindicated on a wrongful murder charge - after 12 years in prison. Upon learning the prosecution held back evidence from his permanent file, Jamieson grabs an officer's gun and holds a young woman hostage at the city courthouse. The SRU team naturally comes to the rescue.

Ramsay's Kitchen
Nightmares
Food, 11 p.m.
Kitchen Nightmares is a better demonstration of the ex-football striker turned Michelin-rated chef's nasty personality than on display in Fox's Hell's Kitchen , still a big hit on U.S. television. Filmed in location on Ramsay's home U.K. turf, the unscripted British series drops the bombastic one into failing restaurants and follows his brutish attempts to restart the place. In each episode, the chef-beast roars. Watch tonight as Ramsay storms into the dreary English resort town of Brighton, where he tries to shape up the flagging seafood eatery Ruby Tate's, owned by ex-actor Allan Love. Right on the trendy beachfront, the joint is dying; the owner hates fish, and appears uninterested.

Law & Order:
Criminal Intent
NBC, 8 p.m.
Most TV critics and L & O purists regard Criminal Intent as the darkest entry in Dick Wolf's seemingly indestructible TV franchise. Many credit the presence of method actor and some-time film star Vincent D'Onofrio as the brooding Detective Goren. In last fall's eighth-season premiere, Goren works his twitchy investigative style on a local politician whose drug-addicted daughter narrowly missed being killed in a contract murder.
Reality
Million Dollar Listing
HGTV, 9 p.m.
Filmed in and around Beverly Hills, the tacky reality series follows three fabulous real-estate agents, named Josh, Chad and Madison. Commissions run six-figures, and each agent is quite the land shark. They're fascinating to watch zipping around the freeways , cellphones glued to their head. Tonight is a Josh episode, and suddenly his own grandmother wants a piece of the action. Granny throws her grandson a plum obituary listing. Somehow Josh ends up repping both buyer and seller while granny harps for her cut.
Documentary
India Reborn
CBC Newsworld, 10 p.m.
Running four hours, this expansive doc series is a smart primer on the once-destitute land now seemingly poised to shape the entire planet's future. The high-definition series capably recaps India's rich history while providing personal profiles of its most prominent citizens. The first chapter, Myth and Might , explains the origins of the cremation pyres on the Ganges and other traditions. The episode also charts the progress of two doctors: One a wealthy heart surgeon, just back from the U.S. and planning to revamp the Indian health-care system. The other, a physician tending to forgotten villagers and victims of various civil wars.

Drama
Diamonds
ABC, 9 p.m.
If this big-budget TV miniseries with an impressive international cast looks familiar, it's possibly because you watched it on CBC a few months ago. The story follows the aftermath of a horrific slaughter at an African diamond mine. The daughter of U.S. senator, played by the versatile Judy Davis, is killed, thereby putting the focus on the savage diamond trade. The story splits between the senator's investigation and a rising operation in the Canadian Arctic, where the diamond business is more civilized, but colder. The story's a bit slow, but Davis makes anything watchable.
Drama
Breaking Bad
AMC, 10 p.m.
Easily TV's most intense drama, Breaking Bad keeps getting darker, and better, each week. The light comic touches of the first season gradually fell away as chemistry teacher Walt White (Bryan Cranston) moved further toward his goal of becoming the crystal meth kingpin of Albuquerque, N.M.. Not by accident, Walt's darkest moments this season coincided with good news about his terminal cancer prognosis. Cranston is remarkable to watch as the tortured Walt. He's a cinch to repeat as next fall's Emmy winner for best dramatic actor.
Sports
Stanley Cup Classics
CBC, 12:30 a.m.
CBC continues the tradition of airing classic Stanley Cup games following live coverage of this season's finals. Tonight's flashback is a corker: Game six of the 1991 Stanley Cup final between the Pittsburgh Penguins and Minnesota North Stars. The clash marked the first time two teams from the original 1967 NHL expansion met in the Stanley Cup final and most real hockey fans can recall where they were when they watched the game. The rebroadcast is worth the late hour for the chance to watch the great Mario Lemieux at the top of his game. Even ailing with a sore back, Lemieux puts on an extraordinary hockey performance. Watch to see why some people still believe he was better than Gretzky.

The Big Bang Theory
CBS, CTV, 8 p.m.
The tradition of the simple-minded sitcom lives on in this series about two geeky prodigies leading fulfilling lives. The basic setup has earned the show a loyal audience and CBS has renewed it for next season. Tonight, the socially inept Sheldon (Jim Parsons) impresses his genius pal Leonard (Johnny Galecki) with his new scientific procedure for making friends. The problem: It works too well. For the show's real fans, the main attraction remains Kaley Cuoco as the duo's sexy neighbour and best friend, Penny. She's every nerd's dream girl.
Reality
Intervention
A & E, 9 p.m.
One of A & E's most-watched programs, this unscripted reality series has held 125 interventions with people caught in the throes of various addictions since the launch in early 2005; the show's producers claim 102 are currently sober. In the seventh-season opener, cameras follow a young man named Gabe, who is gradually falling deeper into heroin addiction. Family members believe Gabe's next stop is the mortuary. Upcoming episodes focus on a traumatized alcoholic firefighter and anorexic identical twins competing to see who can be the thinner sister. All real, and very scary.
Reality
Obsessed
A & E, 10 p.m.
Coming off the Intervention leadoff, this new series segues viewers from addicts to people stricken with extreme anxiety disorders. Each episode follows two subjects through diagnosis, treatment and then follows up two months later. The first show profiles Helen, a single mom of three whose life is controlled by her overwhelming OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder). Still reeling from her father's death in a car accident, she's having panic attacks while driving on the highway. Also profiled is germaphobe Scott, who washes his hands 50 times a day and won't keep a trash can in the house.

NBC, 8 p.m.
Filmed before a studio audience, the two-hour time killer compiles famous TV lines that caught on briefly as public catchphrases. You might be surprised how many trigger weird memories. As determined by the Paley Center for Media, the program includes one-liner clips of long-departed TV legends, including Jackie Gleason ("And awaaay we go...") and Redd Foxx ("It's the big one, Elizabeth!") and guest spots from a handful of still-living stars whose career peak came with a phrase that clicked. The countdown is performed by a dozen or so TV faces, including Ron Howard, Andy Griffith - reunited! - Penny Marshall and Bob Newhart. Does Dana Carvey's Church Lady ("Isn't that special?") finish higher than Polly "Kiss my grits!" Holliday of Alice ?
Drama
Mental
Fox, Global, 9 p.m.
This new summer medical drama looks to be a mental-health version of House . The series stars relative unknown Chris Vance as Dr. Jack Gallagher, a renegade psychiatrist who falls into the top job of psychiatric services at a major Los Angeles hospital. The slick pilot has the handsome shrink showing up for work and immediately bucking the system with his unorthodox method. If House fans work it into their schedule to watch two TV shows a week, Mental could click with viewers.
Drama
Law & Order: SVU
NBC, CTV, 10 p.m.
Guest stars are the highlight of this repeat episode from last fall. A seven-year-old boy caught driving a van in New York comes to the attention of the central SVU duo of Stabler and Benson. Gentle interrogation reveals his parents have been selling him as a guinea pig for harmful medical testing. The boy's sleazy father is played by onetime Beverly Hills, 90210 bad-boy Luke Perry. The investigation reopens a cold case involving a rape victim, played by Sara Gilbert, formerly daughter Darlene on Roseanne .
Food
Iron Chef America
Food Network, 11 p.m.
The Iron Chef phenomenon flared briefly several years back, first as a series of Japanese TV specials that appeared to be real cooking competitions, followed by this series, which was a little more fast-food but still entertaining with the right match-up. On this occasion, the kitchen stadium welcomes New York chef and crowd favourite Michael Symon, whose specialty is regional Italian, and Nate Appleman, pizza chef. The dish is suckling pig. The judging panel includes ex-NFLer Boomer Esiason and one of the Queer Eye for the Straight Guy dudes, so you know this is an official competition.

Drama
Law & Order:
Criminal Intent
NBC, 8 p.m
Shades of Bernie Madoff? There are unmistakable signs of Madoff in an episode from last season. The CFO of a top-drawer New York investment firm is murdered, right at a company event!

Interview
The O'Regan Files: Ron Mann
Bravo!, 8:30 p.m.
Years of hosting Canada AM have made Seamus O'Regan a solid interviewer. Tonight he settles in with Canadian filmmaker Ron Mann, creator of some of this country's best documentaries, including Comic Book Confidential , Grass and the more recent, much-lauded doc Know Your Mushrooms . Upcoming guests include Christopher Plummer. Break from hockey for a half-hour for culture's sake.
Animation
The Goode Family
ABC, 9 p.m.
The Goodes are the new TV family from Mike Judge, creator of King of the Hill and Beavis & Butt-head . Judge folded King of the Hill after 13 seasons to work on this show about an all-American family trying way too hard to stay politically correct in the Obama era. College administrator Gerald Goode, voiced by Judge, is vegan by choice and desperately trying to appease anyone of colour. Gerald and his equally awkward wife Helen drive a hybrid, worship Al Gore and fumble with the best of intentions. Is Judge's take on American life as sharp and funny as it was on King of the Hill ? Yup.
Drama
Criminal Minds
CBS, CTV, 10 p.m.
Some of the best outings in this gritty crime procedural involve the support players. Tonight's encore episode focuses on the lesser-used character FBI special agent Dr. Spencer Reid, played by Matthew Gray Gubler, who heads the investigation of a young boy kidnapped in Las Vegas. The situation immediately causes Dr. Reid to have troubling dreams - turns out that he was also drugged and abducted as a child - which hampers his work on the case. Character actress Jane Lynch, best known for roles in the indie films Best in Show and A Mighty Wind , delivers a moving guest turn as Reid's mother, a paranoid schizophrenic who resides in a mental institution. Powerful stuff.

2009 Scripps National
Spelling Bee
ABC, 8 p.m.
Broadcast on television since 1994, the final round of the National Spelling Bee is grand TV entertainment. Broadcast live, the competition is open to keen young spellers from all over the world. The contestants range in age from 9 to 15, though two-thirds are either 13 or 14. And the kids who have made it to this stage are spelling geniuses. The program provides some background material on selected spellers but the must-watch factor is seeing the kids sweat through words most adults have never even heard. Last year's winner, Sameer Mishra, took top prize for spelling the word "guerdon," a Middle English word meaning reward or payment.

Full text: Vancouver's top condo marketer's address expected to shed light on how sales will increase, but buying habits will change
Vancouver's real-estate market is coming back to life.
But it's not the one that existed before the crash, because the investments and property values of boomers were severely hit by the recession, and they will end up with different buying habits as a result.
That's the big-picture message expected today when Vancouver's prime condo marketer, Bob Rennie, gives his annual state-of-the-city address to developers and builders.
Mr. Rennie said that sales are starting to increase, but the new buyers are predominantly young people who had nothing to lose in mutual funds or property. Now, encouraged by lower prices and low interest rates, they are coming back.
He said that in the past four months, 444 downtown condos less than 10 years old were sold. Of those, almost two-thirds went for less than $350,000.
With only 741 more condos currently listed for sale downtown, Mr. Rennie's statistics indicate there's more demand than supply. Those kinds of numbers were echoed in other municipalities.
"I believe the tide's turned in the last 60 days," he said, echoing others in the development industry over the last couple of weeks.
But Mr. Rennie will be warning that developers can't just go back to old models from last year, when the boom was still on. Instead, they need to focus on that lower-income group in a way they haven't before.
"If you want yesterday back, kill yourself. We have to pay attention to local incomes and we have to re-invent the starter condo," Mr. Rennie said. "We were loading it up with too much luxury."
As for the older customers who used to be more affluent, "we have to re-evaluate the boomers." They are still buying, but are hunting much harder for a bargain.
Mr. Rennie's speech last year, which was a sell-out for the Urban Development Institute, was filled with optimistic-sounding numbers that appeared to run counter to the growing uncertainty about the housing market.
But, although he delivered his traditional upbeat message, Mr. Rennie also noted that the demand for housing in the Lower Mainland was estimated to be 7,000 units, according to statistics on migration into the area, but that builders completed 8,400 units. Few people listened.
This year, his 2008 numbers show an estimated demand for 7,200 units while developers built 13,400. When he gave his talk last May, the signs of oversupply were there - 58 per cent of the available units were unsold.
Now, Mr. Rennie will be talking about the dangers of undersupply.
"Watch the construction starts," he said. "They are scarily low."

Full text:   Balsillie is unlikely to end his quest, should he fail to capture the Coyotes in court, and there are a number of NHL clubs that could be next on his list, David Shoalts says
If Jim Balsillie's Coyote hunt comes to a quick end this afternoon at the hands of U.S. bankruptcy court judge Redfield T. Baum, it does not mean he will give up trying to put a second NHL team in Southern Ontario.
All it means is that the man who fuels the nightmares of NHL commissioner Gary Bettman will sit down with the architect of his pursuit, Toronto lawyer Richard Rodier, and pick another target. Then, when Balsillie and Rodier think the time is right, the roller-coaster ride will start all over again.
According to those familiar with their plans, there will not be an appeal if the judge rules against them on the key question of who controls the club, Phoenix Coyotes owner Jerry Moyes or the NHL.
If the judge rules that Moyes still owns the club and has the right to put it into bankruptcy and sell it to Balsillie, then the next step is the bankruptcy trial.
But if the judge sides with the NHL, which claims Moyes signed away control of the club last November when he stopped covering its enormous losses, then this particular fight is over for Balsillie before it even starts.
The judge could rule today or perhaps some time later after digesting the 100 or so documents filed by both sides.
Balsillie and Rodier believe their legal strategy can work.
The strategy is to buy an NHL team out of bankruptcy and then move it over the league's objections, by winning an anti-trust lawsuit if necessary. Losing the control ruling just means the Coyotes are no longer bankrupt, so they will not get a chance to try their strategy in court.
But the duo quite rightly believes there is a long list of likely candidates in a league that was already dealing with financially shaky teams in non-traditional markets and elsewhere even before the recession came along. Some of those owners are watching this ugly row closely because, if Balsillie prevails, there could be a run on the bankruptcy courts. In a few years, Canada may have more than enough NHL teams for everyone.
Thanks to the number of candidate teams for this, it is hard to say where Balsillie will cast his eye next if the judge sends him back to the starting line. The list of candidates, going in rough order from likely to least likely, includes the Atlanta Thrashers, Nashville Predators, Florida Panthers, Tampa Bay Lightning, New York Islanders, New Jersey Devils, Dallas Stars and St. Louis Blues.
The Thrashers are in the middle of their own bitter court battle. Minority owner Steve Belkin is fighting with the rest of the club's ownership group over the value of his 31-per-cent stake in the company that owns the Thrashers, the NBA's Atlanta Hawks and Philips Arena. Since the Thrashers were not tied to the arena by the bond issue the city made to finance it, they could be easier to move than the other teams.
But first the courts have to settle the fight over how much Belkin's share is worth before the other owners can buy him out. Only then can the Thrashers be sold. And this fight is so nasty there will not be any settlements on the steps of the courthouse.
The Predators bragged this season that they will turn a small profit. But that's only because they squeezed their payroll, bought their own tickets and raked in more than $20-million (all currency U.S.) from their NHL partners in revenue-sharing and escrow payments from the players, in addition to the regular shared NHL revenues like broadcasting.
There is also a bankruptcy court involved with this team. At stake is the share of the team owned by William (Boots) Del Biaggio III before he flamed out into bankruptcy and pleaded guilty to one count of fraud. It is the biggest single slice of the team and would put its winner at the top of the group of owners.
Before Moyes came calling last month, the Del Biaggio shares were Balsillie's preferred target, according to those who know him. They could be again.
***
ALSO SPUTTERING / WILL BALSILLIE KICK THE TIRES?
Aside from the Atlanta Thrashers and Nashville Predators, the other candidates for Jim Balsillie's next attempt to land an NHL team, should he be forced to try again, all have financial problems of varying degrees. Here is a quick look at them:
FLORIDA PANTHERS A chronic money-loser in part because the team's arena was built in a remote suburb of Sunrise. Managing partner Alan Cohen now hopes to merge the team and the arena with a publicly-traded sports acquisition fund directed by New York financier Andrew Murstein. This would provide badly needed cash to develop the real estate around the arena.
TAMPA BAY LIGHTNING NHL ownership has not gone smoothly for majority owners Oren Koules and Len Barrie on and off the ice. They are judged okay by their bankers so far, but could have trouble if the heirs of former owner Bill Davidson want to shed the hefty mortgage he took back on the club.
NEW YORK ISLANDERS Serial incompetence by a series of Islanders owners dragged a once-great franchise down to the status of charity case. Owner Charles Wang, who is fighting with local politicians over a proposed real estate development and renovations to Nassau Coliseum, recently said he wishes he never bought the NHL club.
NEW JERSEY DEVILS The locals never really embraced the Devils despite their excellence on the ice. Owner Jeffrey Vanderbeek hoped moving to a new arena in Newark, a little farther west on the New Jersey Turnpike, would goose revenue. But attendance dropped even further, and there are NHL governors who say the Devils are a source of concern.
DALLAS STARS Owner Tom Hicks has 180 days from March 31, when he defaulted on a series of loans, to negotiate a deal with more than 40 banks or they can put the Stars into bankruptcy. Hicks, with the support of NHL commissioner Gary Bettman, is playing hardball in negotiations and at least some of the bankers are angry enough to say they'll drive him to court.
ST. LOUIS BLUES Dave Checketts financed his purchase of the club in March of 2006, through an investment fund and a loan from a satellite television company. Banking sources say Checketts needed a turnaround in attendance by the time the loans came due. Thanks to the Blues' improvement in the past two seasons, he may clear that hurdle.

Jerry Reinsdorf is not just another major-league owner.
As one of the point men in Major League Baseball's relocation committee and commissioner Bud Selig's point man on ownership matters, it's safe to say few owners in any professional league know the ins and outs of ownership transfer - or where the bodies are buried.
And baseball people who know Reinsdorf say that regardless of his financial stake or ultimate intentions in a purported bid to buy the Phoenix Coyotes, the owner of the Chicago White Sox and Chicago Bulls has no stomach for a protracted public battle over the Coyotes.
The deeper the matter sinks into a legal morass, the greater likelihood he extricates himself completely from the affair. That's apparently one reason the NHL has gone to such great lengths to keep Reinsdorf's so-called "letter of intent" private.
Theoretically, a baseball owner does not have to notify the commissioner's office if the owner is pursuing a franchise in another sport - unless there are plans for cross-collateralization or using the baseball team to finance the purchase. But sources say Reinsdorf has kept Selig informed of his involvement in the Coyotes every step of the way.
Reinsdorf, who is the longest-tenured owner in baseball, maintains a residence in Paradise Valley, Ariz.
The White Sox were successful getting a new spring training site (shared with the Los Angeles Dodgers) built in the Coyotes' hometown of Glendale, and Reinsdorf is a major contributor - along with former Arizona Diamondbacks and Phoenix Suns chief executive officer Jerry Colangelo and Steve Ellman, the Phoenix real estate developer who created the Coyotes mess - to a political action committee with Democratic leanings called Moving Phoenix Forward.
Reinsdorf hasn't commented since the Coyotes story broke. But The Globe and Mail reported Saturday that he was the front man for Hollywood producers Jerry Bruckheimer and Harry Sloan and that the group would ultimately move the team to Las Vegas. Bruckheimer has, according to sources, expressed varying degrees of interest in buying into a major-league team, and also has interest in buying the NBA's Sacramento Kings.
Reinsdorf is seething at the way this has turned into a public spectacle.
Serves him right for getting involved with NHL commissioner Gary Bettman, who wants to preserve the Southern Ontario market for the Toronto Maple Leafs or as an expansion cash cow more than he wants the Coyotes to have a long-term future in the desert, according to legal filings claiming Bettman was ready to return the Coyotes to Winnipeg.
GARBAGE TIME
Enough already. I'm tired of seeing Trent Edwards and Lee Evans. It's to the point where I half expect the Buffaronto Bills quarterback and wide receiver to be working behind the counter at my local Fortinos. Still, at least they're staying out of trouble. A fourth member of the NFL team was arrested this off-season, when fullback Corey McIntyre was nabbed last week in Port St. Lucie, Fla., for allegedly fondling himself in front of a 59-year-old women's window. Last Friday, former Bills star and Hall of Fame defensive end Bruce Smith was nailed for driving under the influence for the third time. Good guys. ... Speaking of fourth, Carolina Hurricanes netminder Cam Ward is, what, Door No. 4 when it comes to picking the goaltender for Canada's 2010 Olympic hockey team? That, plus the fact their scrubs beat our scrubs at the worlds, makes me think the Russians are gold-medal favourites going into Vancouver. ... The more I watch the Washington Nationals flounder, the more I realize how senseless it is that major-league teams are not allowed to trade draft picks. The Nationals are god-awful and consensus No. 1 pick, pitcher Stephen Strasburg, is ready to be this year's David Price. My guess is the Nationals could parlay this pick into multiple major-league-ready talent. ... Hockey Canada honcho Bob Nicholson is doing some kind of "review" of the Canadian women's hockey program after it lost its second consecutive world title to the only other country that takes women's hockey half-seriously, the United States. Let's see: All 12 world women's finals have been between the U.S. and Canada; 11 of the games have been decided by two goals or less, while seven have been one-goal games and there have been four overtime games, two of which have gone to shootouts. Everybody's in favour of equality, but we're taking this a little too seriously, no? ... Baseball iron man Cal Ripken Jr. told a sports banquet this weekend that he wants to know why New York Yankees slugger Alex Rodriguez used steroids and "I'm going to make it my business to find out." The more I see the treatment A-Rod's receiving, the more I think Manny Ramirez is going to be okay when he comes back to the Dodgers after his 50-game suspension. He's the first star who can use the "did the crime, done the time" defence. Closure makes forgiveness come easier.

MONDAY 2 MONDAY
Toronto Blue Jays rookie Travis Snider's playing time will be reduced this week, as Adam Lind gets some action in left field, with an eye toward playing next weekend in a three-game designated hitter-free interleague series in Atlanta against the Braves.
But even though Snider's power has fallen off and his strikeouts have increased - no home runs in 24 games, one double in his last 16, and half as many strikeouts in five games as the 16 he had in his first 24 - the Blue Jays are prepared to show more patience with him than they showed in the past with Lind.
"He'll pinch-hit and play defence," manager Cito Gaston said of Snider.
General manager J.P. Ricciardi dismissed the idea that the three interleague games provide an excuse to let Snider play every day in the minor leagues. "Not yet," he replied, when asked if Snider might be minors-bound.
Snider hasn't been a piker, with three multihit games in his past six, but at the same time, Gaston's no longer had to answer questions about why he's batting Snider ninth.
The Blue Jays' record through 40 games is 26-14, matching the best start in club history. And while it's only mid-May, their 40-game record compares favourably with teams that have emerged this decade from the American League East and gone to the postseason.
Since 2002, the team that has been in first place after 40 games has gone on to win the East three times and claimed the AL wild-card spot in another season. Since 2000, the best 40-game record by any AL East team was the 2002 Boston Red Sox's 29-11 record - and that team is one of just three this decade with a better 40-game record than the current edition of the Blue Jays.

Full text:   Designer Ronald Rael shows that, in the right hands, dirt can be a building material of great beauty
jmays@globeandmail.com
Dirt, plentiful and cheap, is a construction material with a history that stretches back over thousands of years. Billions of people around the world live today in "stable, warm, low-impact structures" made of dirt. Indeed, if architects aren't looking at dirt buildings to provide sustainable, recyclable solutions to building problems, and mining them for inspiration in their designs, they should be.
So argues California designer and theorist Ronald Rael in his engaging new book called Earth Architecture (Princeton Architectural Press, $36.86). To press his case, Mr. Rael presents an international panoply of 47 projects "that are," he tells us, "exemplary of contemporary and progressive earth architecture," all completed since 1970. His examples range from a Tucson luxury home made from compacted dirt and a mud-brick residence in Alice Springs, Australia, to a dirt-block Guinean poultry farming school and an Iran-Iraq war refugee camp in Iran concocted from plastic bags stuffed with local soil.
The results catalogued here are serviceable and often handsome. The dwellings in the refugee camp, designed by the Iranian-born American architect Nader Khalili, are attractive beehive-shaped huts created by coiling the long bags of dirt into ever-smaller circles, and anchoring them in place with layers of barbed wire. Using Mr. Khalili's system, anyone can build a hut quickly without special training or specialized materials. Such simplicity makes the approach handy in emergency situations, where shelter is needed immediately. But one can imagine other applications: homes for survivalists in the backwoods, even permanent housing in remote places.
Most houses Mr. Rael illustrates have been destined for less drastic circumstances than a war-zone, and the earthen parts of them play an intentionally aesthetic role. In a modernistic Australian residence, for instance, the architects established a long, flat front façade composed of compacted tan earth and contrasting cedar panels stained dark brown. The visual result is rich and resonant: Dirt, we find here, can be beautiful.
More interesting, however, are the houses that embody knowledge of earth construction beyond the merely aesthetic. Tucson architect Rick Joy had in mind the multistorey structures put up by the ancient peoples of the American Southwest - imposing earthworks that seem of a piece with the desert - when, in 1998, he created a dramatic house design in his home town.
Like the aboriginal dwellings it recalls, the Palmer-Rose House has been inserted deep in the desert landscape, among native cactuses and trees the architect took pains to preserve. Expanses of floor-to-ceiling glass windows, opening toward mountain and desert views, are framed by massive walls of compacted earth. Tinted with iron oxide to create a glowing rose tone, the material for the walls was a mixture of three local soils and, as a strengthening agent, a portion of portland cement. The artistic success of Mr. Joy's house largely lies in such blending of old methods and modern techniques and materials. Absent here, as elsewhere among the projects Mr. Rael documents, is any dandified archaism. Rather, new construction methods complement and refresh the traditional practices of building with earth.
Like Mr. Joy's, the earth art of Chilean architect Marcelo Cortes emerges from a sustained and fruitful dialogue with the vernacular architectural traditions of his country. Mr. Cortes has long been interested in a wattle-and-daub technology (called quincha ) that goes back 8,000 years in Chile and is still practised today. A framework, or wattle, is first built of wooden strips or lengths of cane or bamboo, which is then daubed with a mix of mud and straw. After it dries, this light, flexible fabric is suitable for walls or ceiling panels.
In his update of quincha , Mr. Cortes makes frames of welded wire mesh instead of reeds or wood. Instead of ordinary, unadulterated mud, a sophisticated blend of earth, lime and other chemicals constitutes the daub. If the house by Mr. Cortes included in this book is anything to go on, the humble quincha building technique has made its transition into modern architecture very handily.
This private residence, created in 2005 in a Santiago suburb, began its career as a wire-mesh framework that roughly described a cube. (Some walls are inclined.) The cladding compound was then applied to the metal wattle. The outcome is a pleasing mud house, warm brown in colour, with light, strong walls that support expansive windows. Like the other projects Mr. Rael has presented, it is a lesson in how one of the world's oldest and most popular building processes can be renewed in a high-tech age, lending its ancient beauty to architectural works of contemporary imagination.

Full text:   If you are embarking on a renovation job, here is a little quiz for the people doing the job
kdeck@globeandmail.com
Hiring a general contractor is like buying a car: While getting the right one isn't rocket science, getting the wrong one is an unmitigated catastrophe. Take heart. Although the search for a good contractor may seem fraught with peril, you have one big thing going for you: You're able to look into a general contractor's eyes and take your measure of him.
Not that being a good judge of character by itself is enough. Your research begins in the hood. Have your neighbours worked with someone they would recommend? If a contractor has worked on nearby houses, it indicates that he's familiar with the era of your home and the local bylaws.
If your hunt for referrals comes up dry, contact your local home builders' association. It will have a list of members who focus on renovations. Once you've narrowed the list to three to five candidates, invite them to your home one at a time to review the project.
At the first meeting, your goal is to determine whether he's a diligent professional who communicates effectively. He should show up on time, with a note pad, measuring tape and digital camera. He should spend an hour reviewing your drawings and investigating your home.
If he's competent, he'll red-flag areas of concern and speak plainly about timelines and budgets.
There are good contractors out there, just as there are good politicians. But the bad ones use the same tactics: They schmooze, charm, hedge and intimidate. They make claims that can't be proven. If a contractor or a politician is a hack, he won't be able to look you in the eye and answer a simple question both clearly and completely.
So here are a few to throw at him:
What does your chain
of command look like?
You want to establish who will be working in your home and the nature of your contractor's relationship with them. If he's a solo show, he'll likely conduct much of the work himself. If so, be sure that he's qualified to wire and plumb.
Larger firms will have carpenters and labourers on their construction team. On a big project, these teams will answer to a site manager, not your contractor. Ask the contractor who your daily contact person will be.
Also, inquire into about your contractor's relationships with electricians, plumbers and so on. Does he have favoured trades he works with on every project? (This will assure quality control but the price will be slightly higher.) Or does he put out to tender parts of the project and award the work to the lowest bid? (This decreases the price, but can create uncertainty about quality.)
What permits are necessary for the job?
If you're doing a large reno, your architect or interior designer will prepare the drawings required for a build-
ing-permit application. With your consent and in most jurisdictions, they can apply for the permit. But a general contractor is responsible for getting all the other required permits and inspections for construction.
Be extremely wary of contractors who say you don't need to apply for permits. As the owner of the property, you're the one who's liable - and, I promise you, the city will make it difficult for you on future permit applications if it sees you've broken the rules. It may also fine you or force you to take down whatever changes you've made and return your home to its original condition.
May I see your written
proposal?
He should have one. A proposal for construction is an exhaustive document that takes a general contractor a few weeks to prepare and submit. It itemizes the labour and material costs for the project and identifies where more information is needed to complete the cost estimate.
The document should also clearly list what is not included in the pricing. That way, creeps in the scope of the project are easily identified during construction.
How do your fees work?
In renovating homes, most contractors like to work on a "cost-plus" contract - the cost of labour and materials plus a percentage (generally 10 to 15 per cent). They prefer this arrangement because there are so many unknowns lurking in the walls, floors and ceilings of old homes.
It's key, when negotiating a cost-plus agreement, to present the contractor with a complete design and request that his proposal be based on that information. You want him to quantify the project as thoroughly as possible at the front end. He should also identify a cap on the cost
of the project - it'll help prevent you from running over budget.
What about changes
during construction?
Changes are one of the costliest aspects of any renovation. Your contractor should have a clear protocol for quantifying and implementing changes that arise because of unknown site conditions or shifts in your feelings about the design.
A change-work order outlines the scope of services required for a change, the necessary materials, and the cost and impact to the schedule. When a change arises your contractor should draft a change-work order and submit it for your approval. If
you don't sign it, it's not
approved.
What's your liability cap?
Your contractor should be willing to provide you with copies of his insurance documents and registrations for workers compensation insurance, liability insurance and, ideally, third-party insurance (to cover subtrades). Ask what the cap on the liability insurance is: You want to be certain that he has enough insurance to cover the value of your home should something happen.
May I have three
references?
I read somewhere that only 30 per cent of employers call the references of a potential employee. What lunacy! Call all three of your contractor's references. And don't be shy with the questions - ask how reliable he was, how timely, how clean the job site, how the crew treated your home, whether the budget was accurate and what problems, if any, arose during the whole process. Then ask how the
clients feel about the contractor now and whether, given the chance, they'd hire him again.

Abstract: One of the biggest lures for GTA buyers will be price. With 690-square-foot, one-bedroom suites starting in the mid-$200,000 range, GTA buyers would get a luxury suite in downtown Waterloo at the same price as a mid-market one in Toronto. Somewhat larger too: 144 Park's one-bedroom units are about the size of suites with one bedroom and a den in the city.

Full text:   Buyers in Guelph, Collingwood, Schomberg can get 40% break over Toronto prices
New York newspaper editor Horace Greeley had some oft-quoted words of advice for anyone seeking a new beginning in the 19th-century United States: "Go West, young man, go West."
You can apply that basic principle to GTA empty nesters looking for relief from stiff new condo prices and the hurly-burly of big-city life. Unless they can easily afford anywhere from $500 to $1,100 a square foot for that new two-bedroom suite and are passionate about staying in the GTA, they might well look west and north to smaller cities and towns such as Waterloo, Schomberg and Collingwoood.
All are within an hour's drive - plus or minus - from the pleasures and diversions of Toronto, but offer what for many is an appealing combination of lower condo costs and a more relaxed approach to life.
"The savings can be significant. We are looking at prices 30 per cent to 40 per cent less than in Toronto - square foot costs as low as $285 instead of $500," says Debbie Cosic of In2ition Realty Inc. She has projects on the go in Collingwood and Schomberg.
The Schomberg one offers a deal unlike anything else on the market: A condo on the banks of the Schomberg River plus a villa suite in Wildwood, Fla., about an hour north of St. Petersburg, starting at $350,000 for the pair.
The projects are called Triumph North and Triumph South and are being built by SigNature Developments Inc. of Concord. You can buy suites in either individually or opt to buy both for the price of a single suite in Toronto.
Granted that $350,000 price only gets you a 650-square-foot, one-bedroom unit in Schomberg and an 800-square-foot, one-bedroom winter home in Florida, but there are singles and couples who do not need anything larger.
Buy a Triumph North one-bedroom alone and it will cost about $180,000, compared with anywhere from $250,000 to $330,000 in the GTA, depending on neighbourhood.
If you want more space, it will, of course, cost you more money. Triumph North has suites ranging up to 1,400 square feet with two bedrooms and a den, and Triumph South offers homes that go up in size to 1,200-square-foot, three-bedroom bungalows.
As for lifestyle, Schomberg is not Yorkville. It is an old Ontario farming village. No bright lights, no vibrating nightspots. But Newmarket is about 15 minutes away by car, as is Vaughan. And for winter months, you can be in Florida in about three hours by jet with regular flights into Orlando, Tampa and St. Petersburg.
There is another out-of-town project aimed at empty nesters worth mentioning. Mady Development Corp., which has built such high-end communities as the Boat Club and Les Falls on Marco Island in Florida, Hackberry Creek Estates in Irving, Tex., and the Waterfront Shores lakeside community in Windsor, says it is about to give Waterloo its first luxury condo.
"Waterloo has mainly seen loft-style renovations. We saw terrific pent-up demand for a real luxury project," says Charles "Chuck" Mady, president of the Mady Group.
His project is called 144 Park - Uptown Waterloo. The name comes from the street address. The site is in a well-established neighbourhood that includes a mix of shops, boutiques, cafes and nightspots and is about a 10-minute walk from the centre of town.
One of the biggest lures for GTA buyers will be price. With 690-square-foot, one-bedroom suites starting in the mid-$200,000 range, GTA buyers would get a luxury suite in downtown Waterloo at the same price as a mid-market one in Toronto. Somewhat larger too: 144 Park's one-bedroom units are about the size of suites with one bedroom and a den in the city.
Each has a large balcony, not just a smoker's nook. They range in size from 65 square feet to more than 200. Prices include an underground parking spot and a storage locker.
For those wanting bigger spaces, suites run up to 2,700-square-foot, three-bedroom penthouses. Three-bedroom condos are in very tight supply in the GTA. There will also be a string of nine, 1,800-square-foot, three-storey, Manhattan brownstone-style townhouses on the site - each with a private elevator.
All suites come with the bells and whistles upscale buyers expect including optional gas-fired ovens and range tops, optional gas fireplaces and the seemingly compulsory granite countertops.
Waterloo may be a bit of a stretch from central Toronto. It would probably mean a 1½-hour drive along the 401, but once there, the city has considerable charm.
In 2007, it was named Canada's "smartest" city. It not only has two top-ranked universities - the University of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier University - but is also the heart of a research triangle that is home to world-class high-tech companies like Research In Motion, creator of the ubiquitous BlackBerry.
In many ways, the proliferation of knowledge-based industries makes the city relatively immune to recessions, Mr. Mady points out. While his target market is empty nesters in the local area, he can see the combination of price and a more relaxed lifestyle winning a place in the hearts and pocketbooks of singles and couples in the Toronto area as well.

If it was a character in a book, the neighbourhood in search of a name would be a classic existential hero. It's more than a century old, as old as the Annex, but nobody knows what to call it. It doesn't even know what to call itself, despite hesitant efforts over the years to acquire a name.
Once it was the heart of a thriving factory district, with trim worker housing clustered as close as possible to the job-spinning smokestacks, railways on three sides and spur lines everywhere. No name was necessary. Now that the factories are almost all closed, it is a rail-bound nowhere - south of the CPR tracks, west of the GO Newmarket line, east of the Georgetown line - badly in need of identity.
Newspaper accounts of anti-pollution activism in the last days of the factories referred to it as the Junction Triangle. In official parlance, it is part of the nebulous Dovercourt-Wallace Emerson-Junction. A past effort attempted to name it the Wallace Junction.
But none of those names stuck, which is why a committee of local activists convened a public meeting, to be held this evening, to launch what promises to be the long and controversial process of naming their orphan slice of the west end.
"We think of it as a community improvement process, something that pulls the neighbourhood together and gives a sense of pride," says Kevin Putnam, a Perth Avenue resident and leader of the unusual initiative, named Fuzzy Boundaries.
The group is proposing a formal consultation process culminating in multiple votes to create a short list of potential names, which will then be submitted to a distinguished panel charged with selecting a winner. All suggestions are welcome, according to Mr. Putnam, and nobody is trying to "jam" the process with preferred names. "That is a no-win proposition," he says.
He admits, however, that opponents have already appeared, mainly in the form of old-timers who say it's the Junction Triangle, as ever, and gentrifiers be damned. But Mr. Putnam, a public-relations consultant who has lived in the neighbourhood for five years, has done his homework. The name Junction Triangle first appeared in a 1976 article by Dick Beddoes in this newspaper and petered out, along with the factories, in the early 1990s.
He doesn't like the name because it suggests submission to the Junction, a better-known neighbourhood with a distinct identity, separated from the orphan triangle by a busy rail corridor. The so-called Junction Triangle is older and quite different from the comparatively suburban Junction, according to Mr. Putnam, echoing sentiments once expressed by former residents of the South Annex, now known as Harbord Village.
But Triangle is also problematic. There is already the West Queen West Triangle to the south, along with something now called the Brockton Village Triangle - both of them artifacts of the same crosscutting rail lines that bound the nameless quarter to the north.
That geography has suggested one of the early favourites in the hunt for a new name: Railtown. Mr. Putnam likes it because it isn't another village. "Everything in this city is a village," he complains. "There's way too many villages."
A case in point - and a brilliant example of the power of identity - is newly named, hotly gentrifying Roncesvalles Village. "It's Parkdale," he notes. But not any more.
Left to its own perverse devices, the real-estate market would probably name the orphan tract Upper Roncesvalles. If nothing else, the Fuzzy Boundaries initiative will forestall such creeping embarrassments.

Full text:   They cost the same as a lawnmower and they'll even throw in their special blend of self-produced fertilizer. Google has found a "low-carbon" way to keep the expansive lawns of its Googleplex trim - they've hired a herd of goats. About 200 creatures from California Grazing, a local "holistic land management" company, are unleashed on Google's Mountain View, Calif., property for a week at a time to nosh and poop until weeds and grassy fire hazards are cleared and the lawns look presentable. It's more fun to watch a mass of furry little critters from the Google offices than a bunch of polluting lawnmowers, writes Dan Hoffman, Director Real Estate and Workplace Services on the company's official blog. To add to the overall cuteness, Jen the border collie drops by to frolic and keep the kids in check. Of course, PETA had just a few criticisms. How are the goats transported?

EMPTY DESKS, EMPTY ROADS
So glad you lost your job - now my ride into work is shorter and much more pleasant. According to traffic-monitoring company Inrix, traffic congestion across the U.S. has dropped 29 per cent nationwide since American companies embarked on their ruthless layoff rampage, reducing the number of folks needing to drive in to work. It's the biggest drop in traffic congestion since the oil crisis in the early 1970s, says Inrix's Scott Sedlick. He told an American Public Media program the lower traffic flow will save each commuter 13 hours of travel time annually. But don't get used to it, says David Ellis of the Texas Transportation Institute at Texas A & M University. He says the traffic jams are sure to return when the recession clears up. So too will the road rage, crazy drivers and rehired folks excited to throw on a suit and hit the freeway.
MY MANAGER SNORES AND HAS REALLY UGLY SLIPPERS
Remember those high-school trips when you crammed as many buddies as you could into one hotel room? Or the fun of crawling into your bunk bed on the first day of camp? Well, get ready to relive those wacky roommate shenanigans on your next business trip, where you just might find yourself bunking with Mike from accounting or that sketchy guy who's always eating burritos in the caf. As a cost-cutting measure, some small businesses and divisions of companies like Pfizer and Microsoft are making travelling employees share hotel rooms, a move that can save as much as 50 per cent of travel costs and build a sense of camaraderie, The New York Times reports. But legal experts warn it can also clear the path for harassment. For Michelle Reeves, an executive at Aramis and Designer Fragrances, a division of Estee Lauder, an embarrassing roommate situation led to a blossoming friendship. She and her work roommate, who was a stranger at the time, became friends when they were drying their hair in preparation for a meeting, she told the Times. It got so overheated that they had to strip down to their skivvies. Let's hope the burrito boy doesn't have similar nudist tendencies.
HEY KID, IT BARELY HURTS. LEMME CRANK UP THE VOLTAGE
It's called "Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day" not "Taser Someone Else's Kid at Work Day." But do forgive a Florida corrections officer for making that mistake. Walter Schmidt was fired last week after he zapped two children with 50,000 volts of electricity on a recent tour of Florida's Franklin Correctional Institution in Carrabelle, Fla., the Associated Press reports. In his defence, Sgt. Schmidt said the kids begged for a demonstration and he got permission from parents before stunning them with the weapon usually reserved for sedating unruly inmates. While there is no word on the ages or condition of the two kids, the department is investigating. Meanwhile, inmates are glad the ruthless zapper has left the prison.

Full text: Robert Fung has turned some of Vancouver's worst eyesores into high-end housing. But the financing model he used to cover the added expense of saving the city's grand old buildings has run into a brutal new reality
Developer Robert Fung stands on Water Street in Vancouver's Gastown, surveying a row of heritage buildings that comprise one of the city's most beautiful streetscapes.
They represent some of the city's oldest buildings, and each of them had been long neglected until Mr. Fung came along and restored them as work, retail and condo spaces.
"He's the poster child of heritage," says Heritage Vancouver president Don Luxton.
But with the downturn in British Columbia's property markets, Mr. Fung now sees himself tied to a complex financing model that no longer works.
The Alhambra building, circa 1887, anchors Water Street, the most historic block in the city. It is part of Mr. Fung's $60-million, three-phase, five-building project that involves "a high level of heritage restoration." The condo building Terminus, once on Heritage Vancouver's Top Ten Endangered Sites list, is the first phase. The heritage building, with its sleek, uniquely modern interior, is finished and mostly occupied. The Garage condos next door, once the location for the city's first jailhouse, will be complete by November.
The Alhambra itself is a three-building, retail-office complex with an historic interior courtyard that wraps the corner of Carrall Street, and it is far from complete. Nearby, on Hastings Street, Mr. Fung has the mixed condo-retail heritage buildings the Paris Block and Annex, which are not quite sold out and finishing construction next year.
Mr. Fung celebrated an official opening party recently for his nearby Flack Block, a fully restored heritage office building at Hastings and Cambie streets that now recalls its former glory of 1899. Over the years it had become a derelict haven for heroin users in an area still rife with drug problems.
Mr. Fung says his work on in the area not only saves buildings, but revitalizes the local economy and gives residents a serious morale boost.
As he surveys his work, Mr. Fung appears his usual serene self, despite the setbacks that have occurred over the last couple of years. His Trapp Block heritage project in historic New Westminster is "on hold." The Terminus had been sold out - until some of the owners couldn't complete their purchases due to the economic downturn. It means several of the units are still for sale.
"Of course I'm worried about the downturn," he says. "The Terminus building was sold off, and we've received some of the suites back. I only planned to sell it once."
As well, heritage restoration costs significantly more than building new from the ground up, which is why Mr. Fung depended on city incentives for his Gastown projects. Aside from grant money, he has relied on millions of dollars in bonus density transfers to fund the six heritage projects in the area. The practice allows Mr. Fung to sell unused density from his projects to another developer, in order to cover the high cost of heritage restoration. The density cannot be sold, however, until the projects are completed.
More than anybody, Mr. Fung made use of the incentive. To put it in perspective, Mr. Fung says there is about 500,000 square feet of transfer density currently banked by the city. His share is 400,000 square feet - and in this market, nobody is looking to buy.
"We have satisfied the need to create some investment in the area, we've satisfied the need to save buildings and to create more economic diversity in the neighbourhood," he says. "At the back end, we also need to sell this density to pay the bank back - not being able to do that is a huge problem."
It could get much worse.
Through the heritage building rehabilitation program, the city approved a record amount of transfer density. Marco D'Agostini, the city's senior heritage planner, estimates that if all approved projects are completed, there is potentially 1.5 million square feet of bonus density that would be for sale. That figure is part of the reason the city put the heritage building rehabilitation program on hold in 2007, and has kept it on hold. Mr. D'Agostini says its future is under review and a report will go before city council next month. The program includes façade grants and property tax exemptions, which Mr. D'Agostini expects council to continue. It's the transfer density that is the sticking point. There is simply too much density banked for it to be absorbed into the market.
The sale of density to offset the cost of heritage restoration is a market-driven tool that's been used effectively for years, says Mr. Luxton of Heritage Vancouver. It is, he says, the best tool heritage advocates have to protect historic buildings. In 2003, the policy was extended to include the neglected historic neighbourhoods of Chinatown, Gastown and the Downtown Eastside. It stimulated more than $400-million in heritage development in those areas, including the Woodward's building, which is currently under construction and nearing completion.
"The density bank worked really, really well for many, many years," Mr. Luxton says. "But in 2006 it just went right over the top. Part of the reason was several large projects came on stream all at once, including Woodward's and the Evergreen Building [in Cole Harbour] - and whamo . There was nowhere to put all that density."
"No one had anticipated things would slow down quite so much," Mr. D'Agostini says.
"Robert has got carrying costs, and they have realized the projects, they've done them, and they've got bills to pay to contractors and everybody. It's part of the reason they proceeded with the projects, because they could sell the density and recover the costs," Mr. D'Agostini says.
"You could say those developers knew what they were getting into, but at the same time we want to make sure we are trying to be helpful wherever we can. We can't force another person to buy density ... there is only so much we can do as well."
The city can help by not banking more density until equilibrium has been achieved, he says. "If we keep creating more density, it will, I think, have a significant impact on the value of any density that's been created. We may completely devalue the tool."
As the largest holder of banked density, Mr. Fung simply wants the city to make the program work. He recognizes the city is attempting a solution, but he says it is slow in doing so.
As well, he believes the city could do more for developers like him who played a vital role in restoring old neighbourhoods. He argues that even in the strongest real estate market, the city controls the absorption of the density. The city controls the value and amount available for transfer, as well as zoning laws that would make transfer of that density possible.
"They pay the developers for daycare by giving them density, so they should be taking density from us and doling it out with other packages of amenities to other developers," Mr. Fung suggests. "Otherwise, they compete against us.
"It bothers me that there's not more energy put into making the system healthy and recognizing that the city, in doing this, has led a lot of people down the garden path. But the stroke of a pen is all it takes to make it work properly.
"I'm hoping what will change is a recognition that the program as it exists is non-functional," Mr. Fung says, "and has been very unfair to the people who've made it successful for the city."

Listing agent: Nutan Brown, Royal LePage Real Estate Services Ltd.
The major factors in the sale of this two-storey house were its premium location and modern look, agent Nutan Brown says.
In terms of its location, most buyers were attracted to its quiet setting northwest of Jane Street and Baby Point Road, within steps of parkland along the Humber River, public transit and schools.
"It's a very child-friendly neighbourhood," Ms. Brown says. "It's on a small ... street, so there's minimal local traffic."
The 1930s home underwent cosmetic improvements, structural modifications and mechanical updates over the past two years. That included a new ductless air conditioner unit, refinished hardwood floors and two remodelled bathrooms, among other things.
"It a beautifully renovated property in absolutely move-in condition," Ms. Brown says. "The house was virtually gutted."
The wall between the dining room and kitchen was also removed for a more open layout. "That has a huge appeal," the agent says. "That's how people are entertaining and living now."
The kitchen also has granite countertops, stainless steel appliances, including a gas range, and a door to the deck, fenced backyard and detached garage off a mutual driveway.
Despite all the changes, the foyer, fireside living room and three bedrooms upstairs retain some original details.
"The house has a lot of gumwood wainscoting, gumwood trims and French doors," Ms. Brown says. "It was all restored beautifully."
There is a separate entrance to the basement, where there is a sauna off the bathroom and a recreation room with ceramic floors and above-grade windows.

Full text: Innovative investment fund led by a master at winning property change approvals has some big-name backers
He developed a reputation as Toronto's top legal wizard for helping clients gain rezoning and development approvals.
And now Stephen Diamond is putting that track record to use in a new venture: an innovative real estate investment fund that instantly drew the backing of some of the biggest players in Toronto's real estate sector.
Even in the midst of the economic meltdown, he and his backers say they have faith in both the vision and the timing.
Mr. Diamond's Whitecastle New Urban Fund - launched last fall with $70-million raised from big industry players including RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust and Sterling Silver Development Corp., as well as Mr. Diamond's own family venture capital firm - is a real estate investment fund with a distinct difference. Its aim is to identify urban properties in Toronto where the zoning can be changed to permit much higher use, shepherd those zoning changes through the complicated approvals process, and then either sell the property at a substantial gain or develop it on its own or with partners.
The fund has already made its first acquisition: a block of century-old storefront buildings with extra land behind them on the southwest corner of Yonge and St. Joseph streets in Toronto. Once rezoned, the plan is to restore those storefronts to their former glory, providing 35,000 square feet of prime retail space, and then build a 49-storey, glass-walled condo tower behind them.
What promises to be Mr. Diamond's competitive edge is his successful career as a municipal affairs lawyer. For 20 years, he was the go-to guy when developers needed a deviation from the official plan, increases in permitted density or a change in zoning for projects.
First with his own firm, Diamond Fairbarn, and then with McCarthy Tetrault LLP, Mr. Diamond stick-handled city council approval for super projects in Toronto such as the Four Seasons Hotel & Residences at Bay and Yorkville streets and Minto Midtown at Yonge and Eglinton.
He has guided his clients through the mangrove swamp of zoning and official plan changes such projects required, and patiently negotiated a consensus among stakeholders, such as ratepayer groups, local merchants, city planners and ward councillors. He has brokered deals that allowed heights well beyond previously established official limits, and persuaded city council to increase density to the levels where developers could build projects that turned a solid profit. His work on behalf of developers helped to change the face of the city.
Mr. Diamond grew up surrounded by key players in the development industry. His father was A.E. Eph Diamond, founding partner and later chairman of Cadillac Fairview Corp. and one of the most respected men in Canadian real estate.
Mr. Diamond, 57, flirted briefly with retirement when he left his partnership at McCarthy Tetrault two years ago. His wife got tired of him using her computer and told him to get out of the house and find an office, he says with a laugh.
He did indeed find one with his younger brother Carey, 54, who runs the family firm, Whitecastle Investments Ltd. Then he went much further by launching the new fund.
His vision and his reputation as the master of rezoning applications were so strong that the fund was oversubscribed within days. Units were snapped up by some of the leading names in development.
RioCan, one of Canada's largest shopping mall developers and the country's largest REIT, took a $10-million stake, and Sterling Silver, which has a substantial portfolio of apartment buildings and develops industrial and commercial space, also took a sizable chunk (it will not disclose how much), as did Whitecastle Investments. The remainder went to other private investors. The minimum stake was $2-million.
"We see it as the way of the future," says RioCan president Edward Sonshine. "Steve knows exceptionally well what can be done with urban properties and how to create substantial value through the rezoning process. I always told him he stayed practising law too long and this is what he should be doing."
Sterling Silver president Ronald Faust is equally full of praise.
Mr. Diamond "has this ability to work through extraordinarily complicated situations like with the Four Seasons project. He has this wonderful commitment to quality and a terrific insight into what the city wants. That makes all the difference in projects like this," Mr. Faust says.
"He knows 100 per cent what can be done. We have wanted to work with him for some time and this is a great opportunity. Steve is simply a class act."
A class act with a concept that promises to reap considerable financial rewards. Whitecastle projections call for investors to earn a return on their investment of at least 15 per cent a year over the fund's seven-year lifespan.
Perhaps even more important, they get first call should the fund decide to sell its newly rezoned properties or take in development partners.
"It will provide us with a feeder stream for new urban projects, something we are very interested in," Mr. Sonshine says. "The fund is also very strong because it has terrific cash-rich investors."
Cash-rich and solidly supportive investors play a vital role in the success of the fund, Mr. Diamond admits, especially in these days of a severe credit crunch.
While the fund's approach is to purchase properties with perhaps a 20-to 30-per-cent down payment, and a vendor-take-back mortgage for the balance, it has a commitment from its partners to provide financing should the vendor balk at offering a mortgage.
"We think the resources we have now are enough to do between five and eight projects over the life of the fund," Mr. Diamond says.
He is not concerned about the current global recession. In fact, what seemed like a good idea when the economy was booming may prove an even better one when it is sagging.
"The rezoning process will take about two to three years. By the time it is done and we are ready to sell or develop the site, today's tough times will very likely be behind us," he says.
"When recovery comes, we think there will be solid built-up demand for both residential and retail because almost no new projects will be launched during the recession."
Mr. Sonshine agrees. "There is always a risk with land. If projects like the St. Joseph one were coming on stream today, there would be no market for them," he says.
"But I think the timing - two to three years for the rezoning - is going to work perfectly for us."

Why a 'positive second derivative' isn't all positive

Author: Blackwell, Richard

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/why-positive-second-derivative-isnt-all/docview/382638644/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: It's the same idea as when you are running. The rate of change of your position (your velocity) is the first derivative. Your acceleration (the rate of change of the rate of change of your position) is the second derivative. If you are still running fast, but you are decelerating, your first derivative is positive but your second derivative is negative.

Full text: I keep hearing economists say that some indicators are showing a "positive second derivative." What does that mean?
It is a mathematical term, and there's nothing like a little mathematics to make economics even more fun.
When you take an indicator, such as the level of manufacturing, and look at its rate of change, that is the first derivative. If manufacturing is slowing down, its first derivative is negative.
The second derivative is the rate of change of that rate of change. So when manufacturing is still slowing down, but not as quickly as before, the second derivative is positive.
It's the same idea as when you are running. The rate of change of your position (your velocity) is the first derivative. Your acceleration (the rate of change of the rate of change of your position) is the second derivative. If you are still running fast, but you are decelerating, your first derivative is positive but your second derivative is negative.
What does that mean for measurements of the recession?
Several measures show the economy is still shrinking, but not as fast as before. So the second derivative is positive.
A real turnaround won't happen, however, until the first derivative is positive for several indicators. That happens when the numbers actually start to improve, not just get worse more slowly.
Yesterday, we saw some real gains in U.S. construction spending and pending home sales. Those "first derivative" increases helped propel the markets to big gains.
Why are the U.S. home sales numbers released yesterday called "pending"?
The numbers, from the National Association of Realtors, are pending because a contract to sell a house has been signed but the deal has not closed yet and money has not changed hands. Once the closing takes place, a month or two after the contract is signed, each deal becomes part of the NAR's actual home sales numbers.
In Canada, the monthly home sale figures we see from the Canadian Real Estate Association are similar to the NAR's "pending" numbers.
CREA - and local real estate boards across the country - count a sale as taking place when an offer to purchase is accepted without any conditions.
The boards say they don't wait until closing because the timing varies from house to house, and the data are not as easily gathered at that point.

Full text: Looking for work takes more than pounding the pavement in these tough times
Dawn Montgomery is a savvy saleswoman. Her product? Dawn Montgomery.
The Hamilton job hunter has her own slogan, which says she "always goes the extra mile." The last four digits of her phone number spell her first name. She stacks her arms full of half-page flyers and slaps them on the windshields of parked cars. Sometimes she rides the rails and hands mini-resumes to commuters in the Greater Toronto Area. She'll strike up conversations with them in hopes they have a lead.
"I don't just sit down and say, 'Hi, I'm Dawn, I'm looking for a job,' " she says. "I don't think that works; I think that's using people."
What does work in her job search, she says, is self-promotion. She has been at it for three months, since losing a data-analysis gig in January. It hasn't yet landed her work, but she has noticed results. Almost 20 people have called saying they picked up her card. "Twenty people now know about me who didn't before," she says. "I'm getting my name out there."
As the unemployment rate continues to rise and the competitive job market takes hold, more exasperated job hunters have become shameless self-promoters. They're airing commercials on local TV stations, slapping their faces on billboards, and placing creative "employment wanted" ads in community newspapers and niche magazines.
Such in-your-face exposure can lead to results, experts say. But, they caution, there's a fine line between being a savvy marketer and just looking desperate.
Done right, self-promotion can be a job hunter's salvation, says Jim Geraghty, president of Happen, a Canadian executive networking group. It's often the attention-grabbing key to the invisible job market: employers who are hiring but don't want the onslaught of resumes a public posting invites.
"You really don't have an awful lot to lose," Mr. Geraghty says. "The bottom line is you're looking to separate yourself from your competitors and anything that helps you do that, assuming that it's done in good taste, would be more effective than not doing it."
He's seen people take the "trinkets and trash" approach, printing their name and number on pens and key chains and handing them out. One job applicant attached a bag of peanuts to the corner of a resumé with a note saying, "Will work for peanuts."
"If someone came to me and said 'I want to try this,' I would certainly suggest another strategy," Mr. Geraghty says.
Sharon Irwin-Foulon has also seen some pretty wild attention-grabbing tactics. The director of career management at the University of Western Ontario's Richard Ivey School of Business recalls an applicant who wrote a cover letter in the form of a wedding invitation.
"It was something like, 'This person is marrying the company name.' They can be pretty cheesy," she says.
If you don't understand your audience, you risk being remembered for all the wrong reasons, she says. "If you were applying to a bank, the flyers and a video [resumé] would speak to a lack of information or knowledge of who your audience is."
Job hunter Newman Mallon tried to target his search when he posted a "job wanted" ad in Marketing Magazine, an industry publication. After being laid off by a photo-ID equipment company in April, 2007, Mr. Mallon looked for work the traditional way but came up with little more than a three-month contract. Exasperated, he took out an ad last October that read, "Egads! 512 resumes and 16 months later, still very little work!"
"It was attention-getting," he says, though it didn't yield many results. "I wasn't looking for pity or anything. I'm just making it known that I was open to something that would work."
Mr. Mallon also built a website for himself, which many interviewers asked about.
A Web presence is perhaps the most effective form of self-promotion in a tech-savvy world, says Bruce Firestone, entrepreneur-in-residence at the University of Ottawa's Telfer School of Management (and founder of the Ottawa Senators hockey team).
"Many of the employers I work with today will not hire anybody that does not have a blog," he says.
Employers these days are bored by the standard resumé and crave a bit of spark, especially when the market is so dreary, says David Perry, an Ottawa-based headhunter and co-author of Guerrilla Marketing for Jobhunters .
"It's amazing what you have to do to get someone's attention," he says. "Everybody in these resumes talks about how creative they are, how dynamic and blah, blah, blah. Well, I'm from Missouri, show me."
A self-promotional job hunt isn't desperate, he says, it's creative and necessary.
Ms. Montgomery, for one, says she's had little luck with job boards and cold-calling companies. But on the commuter train last Thursday, she met a Hamilton charity manager who urged her to apply for a fundraising job. She also met the vice-president of a large recruiting organization who promised special attention for her resumé if she forwarded it to him. After handing out more than 300 of her cards, she was tired but cheerful.
"The fact remains that I'm getting noticed," she says.
And about a month ago, Paul Copcutt plucked one of Ms. Montgomery's cards, featuring her photo and a list of skills, off a community board at his local bank. The branding consultant in Dundas, Ont., was looking for administrative help and decided to call her. Ms. Montgomery is working on a quote for him, and if all goes well she'll have a job, he says.
"I like innovative ways of going about promoting yourself," he says. "The only other people you see sticking up cards are real-estate agents. I just thought that was a little bit different."

Abstract: Perhaps I belonged to a quilting circle in a previous life, because something has to explain my deep affection for handmade quilts. When I was in my 20s and my girlfriends were starting to collect designer handbags I was, you guessed it, buying antique quilts at auction (don't laugh). Fortunately for me I still love my quilt collection (and I don't think I've seen any of them toting a 1990's handbag lately).

Full text: Made for sunny days and lounging at the water's edge, your recreation home needs a playful decor
srichardson@globeandmail.com
Cottage bedrooms offer a unique and refreshing take on style. As a spot that is only used in the warm summer months one need not consider four-season comfort and opt instead for bright, sunny style.
With this in mind I decided to dial up the colour quotient and fill all my cottage bedrooms with perky prints and sassy shades reminiscent of what you'd discover in a country wildflower garden. My decision to embrace all shades of the rainbow doesn't mean I opted for a kaleidoscope extravaganza (after all, this is where I retreat to find calm and tranquillity and don't want to feel like my cottage is part of Doug Henning's stage set).
After seeing some of the rooms I've designed over the years, you might assume that my bedroom would be dressed entirely in shades of white (ecru, oyster, alabaster, snow, parchment and vanilla to name a few). But I decided to step out of my comfort zone and dive into the paint box for this project.
The right red
My husband, Alexander, loves red about as much as I love white. I had carte blanche on the design of the entire cottage and got everything I wanted, so I knew he'd appreciate it if there were a scheme that really represented him amidst the sea of signature SR style. I decided to give red a shot in our bedroom.
The challenge is to make red feel right for summer. It's a fiery colour that is often used to create an atmosphere of warmth, which I really didn't need. For me, the right shade is more tomato soup than cherry and more faded than fire truck. I opted for fabrics that had a sun washed look and tempered their warm tones with a healthy balance of cool denim blues and crisp whites to make it feel breezy and light.
What's under the bed?
In our cottage, there's no need to worry about monsters hiding under the beds: there's no room for them! Since we are tight on space I wanted to make the most of every usable inch. Instead of letting valuable storage space go to waste, I chose a king size bed frame with six giant storage drawers for our bedroom, and tucked trundle beds under the twin bed frames in the kids room. We can stash and stow lots of stuff in our drawers, and two extra little ones in the kids bedroom. Now that's what I call efficient use of space.
Bucket brigade
Cottage living requires multiple quick changes through the course of a day. From cool mornings to mid-day heat, swim time to nap time and every hour in between, it seems someone always needs a change of outfit. I like it when everything is easy to find (and easy to put away) so hooks and buckets are a recurring design solution for casual living. With hooks mounted low on the wall a brightly coloured metal bucket can be hung up and instantly provide an easy stashing spot for everything from bathing suits to books.
Newer isn't always better
The latest is often the greatest, but not when it comes to cottage furnishings. To get the most authentic "cottage" look I turned to a handful of local dealers to outfit my space in vintage treasures. While the beds are new, just about everything else that fills these rooms is of the pre-loved persuasion. Quilts, lamps, dressers, side tables, desk, chairs, stools, textiles and tchotzkes all had a previous life before they made it to our island. The character and patina inherent in these pieces helps bring a sense of history and charm to our new cottage. The fact that they come from local merchants and cost a fraction of what I'd pay to buy new is just the sprinkles on my sundae.
Quilting bee
Perhaps I belonged to a quilting circle in a previous life, because something has to explain my deep affection for handmade quilts. When I was in my 20s and my girlfriends were starting to collect designer handbags I was, you guessed it, buying antique quilts at auction (don't laugh). Fortunately for me I still love my quilt collection (and I don't think I've seen any of them toting a 1990's handbag lately). You can easily find new quilts that are colourful and fun and compliment your room scheme, but they cost at least as much (if not more) than the vintage variety, and don't have the same charm. You'll likely never find a pair that match so focus instead on finding specimens with complimentary colours and patterns and make the mix and match look part of the focus. Always be sure to inspect a vintage quilt before you buy it and only buy pieces in good condition or else you'll be starting up your own quilting bee to try and repair them.
Floor show
Summer is a season for barefoot elegance and nothing feels better underfoot than painted wood floors. They are easy to sweep up, glisten in the light, and allow the introduction of yet another summery hue to your design scheme. The key to successful floor painting is to ensure you use the right materials, and never cut corners on the prep work. Oil-based floor enamel gives the most enduring finish and high gloss shine, plus it can be mixed in any colour you dream of. Be sure to sand the floor well to allow the paint to adhere to the boards. If you are starting with a raw wood floor, cut the paint by 25 per cent with mineral spirits for the first coat so that it penetrates the wood and provides a lasting base. Sand between coats to remove any dust particles, and don't stop till you have a gleaming and beautiful finish (three coats is a good rule of thumb). As the promise of summer draws nearer, I can almost feel my bare feet gliding across those pretty painted floors.

Full text: Old France and modern B.C. make an odd pairing - but it works
kdeck@globeandmail.com
Mamie Angus and Sherry Killam have probably the worst job I've ever heard of. Every year or so, the Vancouver women go to France and, staying in small inns, travel the countryside, buying scads of antiques, drinking wine and eating cheese as they go. Rough, eh?
Then the women bring all the booty home, install it in a warehouse showroom and throw open the doors. Everything gets bought up in a few weeks. I'd heard the buzz about these shows for the past couple of years but, until recently, hadn't made it out to see one.
Although the show sounded like high times, I had low hopes of finding anything for my clients. In my limited experience of French antiques, I've found them ornate and stuffily formal. But I was pleasantly surprised. Their collection includes everything from hand-embroidered linen sheets to pressed steel stools and chairs from the Second World War era. Although many of the pieces are very different, they're united by an aura of being weathered.
This feeling of battered authenticity is what makes them perfect complements to West Coast interiors. The objects themselves are older than the homes on the West Coast, of course, but the bond between them exists is in their absence of pretension. The French have a different way of expressing it: the pieces are dans son jus - in their own juice.
Here are my four favourite items from this year's show, and a few hints, for those so inclined, on how to incorporate them into your home.
Antique mirror, $1,000+
If there's just one French country antique in your future, a mirror is where you should spend the dough. It takes on the patina of age - scratches, chips and discolourations forming a physical record of the places it has been and indignities it has suffered. No human being of a certain age can be immune to charm like that.
The eccentricity of the glass gives mirrors like these their soul. Any French piece made before 1850 is likely to be mercury glass, whose finish gives a mottled reflection of great texture and depth. For this reason, install your mirror where it will be noticed. You don't want it in liminal spaces such as a hallway, and don't hang it over your bed. Put it instead over the powder room vanity or a Lucite table at the front entrance. The mirror needs to be somewhere where its surface can be studied and appreciated.
Crystal chandelier, $2,000+
People spend thousands on sparkly new chandeliers. That's all well and good: They're well suited to sleek, polished interiors. But if you're looking to enhance the relaxed eclecticism of a West Coast interior, it's hard to do better than the tarnish and opacity of a French chandelier.
The pieces are most interesting against a utilitarian backdrop - a modern white kitchen or bathroom - where the chandelier's opulence can play with the spirit of austerity and efficiency. There's just one rule: Since you're splashing out with the chandelier, dial down the amplitude everywhere else.
In a kitchen application, hang one or two chandeliers over the island or central table. A modern table of teak, walnut or ash will anchor this design scheme with its warmth. The best chairs will be light, modern and functional.
In a dining room application, you'll want similarly to avoid indulgence. Ornate wallpapers, jewel-coloured velvets and lacquered furnishings give everything the whiff of being overperfumed. An understated dining table will give the chandelier room to breathe. Balance everything out with swooping dining chairs upholstered in linen, and on the walls put a textured wallpaper or unsaturated paint colour. The goal is to create negative space around the marquee furnishing as a way to enhance its form.
carved armoire, $8,000+
Historically, when a French countryman had a daughter, he commissioned a craftsman to make marriage armoire from wood. Each piece is unique because it was the commissioner's wealth that dictated the degree of carved detail. The ones I like best are not ornate, though, but the more modest pieces with their marks of imperfection. I'm a sucker for weary underdogs.
The challenge with bringing the armoires into your home is their size. They are, on average, three feet wide, two feet deep and six feet tall. If you need extra space for one, you can often find it in the master bedroom. Position the piece in the room so that its face can be appreciated. In the corner, on an angle, is a nice solution because it hides the armoire's bulk.
Caution and restraint are the watchwords for the remaining furnishings: Bulky pieces such as a four-poster or sleigh bed will cramp the room. Your preference should be for things that refer to the armoire (cubes of alder wood as side tables, say) or that add a modern flair to the room (such as a slim chrome and white-leather bench).
Rolled steel table, $5,000+
It's seems strange to say, but even with all the more quaint and lovable pieces, this plain steel table is my collection favourite. At first glance, I found it lacklustre, but the more I looked at it, the more I fell in love with its flawless proportions.
Made in the late 1920s, when industrialization was taking over from the tradition of local craft, the table would have been used in a factory. It's surprisingly slim, and its subtlety makes it a poor match for a room full of many finishes and colours. It will be happiest surrounded by lots of white space, as in a kitchen or an art studio.
A piece like this can't be paired with upholstered seats: It will make them seem bulky. Choose instead a chair equal in utility, something modern in moulded fibreglass or plastic - in a bold colour if you want to punch up the whimsy. Overhead, I'd recommend an industrial light fixture - something that shows the workings of the bulbs.
What do you think of the pieces? I don't have room in my apartment for the table and I certainly don't need an armoire, so this time I left with a modest set of antique keys. They sit proudly on my bedside table next to a favourite porcelain bowl.
But I'll certainly have my ear to the ground for the next sale. Then, I'm not leaving without a chandelier.

Where others saw swampland on Lake Simcoe, Hungarian immigrant saw the Lagoon City resort

Abstract: "It was the fallout of the recession," said Stan Meek, who served 14 years on the company's board of directors. "It was really because there was a high concentration of mortgages with Confederation Life Insurance," Mr. Meek said. "When Confederation went under, there was a huge cash call."

Full text: 'He was a true entrepreneur,' his son says. 'He saw opportunities to make money everywhere.'
After the Canadian consulate in Budapest twice rejected his application to immigrate, Andrew Zsolt was determined to find out why. After all, he had arrived for his interviews clean-shaven and dressed in his Sunday best. And he had a newly minted degree in civil engineering. He cultivated a source in the consulate and found his answer: Canada was looking for farm labourers, not engineers.
Thus, on his third try, he showed up dressed in scruffy clothes, unshaven and with dirt under his fingernails. He told the interviewers that he would work on his aunt's farm near Kitchener, Ont., picking strawberries if he was approved. He was.
That determination and resiliency in the face of obstacles became a hallmark of his life in Canada. Mr. Zsolt arrived in Toronto in 1949 with five dollars in his pocket, speaking no English, but with big dreams.
Within a year, he was working as a professional engineer with The Foundation Co. of Canada. Nine years later, he formed Inducon Development Corp., taking it from a one-man operation to a multimillion-dollar group of companies.
"He was a true entrepreneur," said his son, Tom. "He saw opportunities to make money everywhere. He had a very good nose for real-estate business."
Mr. Zsolt was above all a visionary and an artist whose masterpiece was Lagoon City, a resort town he created on Lake Simcoe in Ontario.
"Lagoon City was the actualization on a grand scale of the place where he lived as a child. Siofok had a canal system and a shared communal beach," said his wife, Jean.
Mr. Zsolt was shocked that Ontario had no resort towns and he decided to build one in the European tradition.
He understood the need to preserve precious farmland, so he purchased a dead peat bog and unusable swampland, seeing their potential. In 1962, he began the lengthy process of acquiring local and provincial planning permits.
"People thought he was crazy," his son said. "But he never quit."
Over the years, he bought more property as funds permitted, eventually accumulating 647 hectares.
He dug a world-class marina for large boats, built 13 kilometres of canals and constructed 3,000 homes, a mix of single-family residences, condominiums and townhouses, all with access to a shared beach. He believed that everyone in the town, not just a privileged few, should have beach access. He also built a yacht club and the Harbour Inn and Resort Club, Canada's first time-share.
Mr. Szolt began his business empire by buying a few lots on which to build houses. He then focused on the suburbs around Toronto, where he foresaw growth potential.
He is credited with creating the industrial-mall concept, now a prominent fixture in Southern Ontario. He undertook small projects and progressed to large office parks, including the Cosmopolitan Corporate Centre, Metro West Corporate Centre and Canada Airway Centre.
Andrew Zsolt inherited his entrepreneurial spirit from his parents, Ernest and Josephine, who started several businesses in Hungary, including a chain of small movie theatres. His passion for building and design came from his father, who was a master builder.
The youngest of three children, he grew up in Siofok, a small town on Lake Balaton near Budapest. It was on this lake that he developed a lifelong passion for sailing.
He studied civil engineering at the Technical University of Budapest and did not experience the direct impact of the Second World War until 1944, when Germany occupied Hungary during his final year of study. Anticipating a victory over the Allied forces and a subsequent need for engineers, Germany transferred fourth-year engineering students from Budapest to Germany. However, with the Allies bombing Germany, Mr. Zsolt was unable to continue his education.
In the meantime, he struggled to survive, scrounging for food and keeping on the move to avoid the Allied bombing. He left Dresden just two hours before the town was bombed.
When the war ended, he found himself in the Russian zone of Germany and decided to make his way to West Germany. He was on foot until, ever resourceful, he swapped a found Swiss watch for a car. As he and several friends neared the West German border, the car ran out of gas. They made a dash for the border, pushed the car down a hill and then got inside and coasted to freedom.
Mr. Zsolt eventually enrolled at the Technical University of Munich, receiving his degree in 1948. His plan to return home was sideswiped by a letter from his mother telling him not to come because life under the Russians was not safe. He also learned that the Russians had killed his brother. Heeding his mother's advice, he decided to emigrate.
Once in Canada, he picked strawberries at his aunt's farm, as he had said he would, and taught himself English. Shortly after his arrival, friends introduced him to Veronica Hetenyi, a nurse from Richmond Hill, Ont., whose parents had emigrated from Hungary. They married in 1952 and had five children, one of whom drowned in 1962 when he was 3. Veronica died in 1975.
In the late 1970s, Mr. Zsolt met Jean Shaver McManus, a business consultant sent by her firm to help Inducon with a project. They were both single parents, each with four children. When they married in 1980, Mr. Zsolt built an addition to his home to give each of his new children a bedroom. "He was a very brave man to contemplate this merger," Jean said.
Mr. Zsolt's business empire eventually crashed. In 1992, hit by the recession and burdened with a huge debt, Inducon Development Corp. declared bankruptcy and its assets were liquidated.
"It was the fallout of the recession," said Stan Meek, who served 14 years on the company's board of directors. "It was really because there was a high concentration of mortgages with Confederation Life Insurance," Mr. Meek said. "When Confederation went under, there was a huge cash call."
Lagoon City would have been even grander had Inducon survived the recession. Mr. Zsolt had planned to add an 18-hole golf course, several hotels and shopping facilities.
But the loss of his business was just another obstacle to overcome. "A lesser man would have been destroyed, having built a huge company and managing millions of square feet. But he never stopped," his wife said.
At 70, he set about starting a new career. Building in Hungary was booming and he obtained the Stanley Doors franchise for that country. When he sold the business in 2002, he had 26 distributors working for him in Hungary.
Five years ago, he was diagnosed with a progressive debilitating disease. His condition worsened quickly in March after the sudden death of his son John in a snowboarding accident.
ANDREW ZSOLT
Andrew Zsolt was born April 7, 1923, in Budapest. He died at his Toronto home on April 15, 2009, of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. He was 86. He leaves his wife, Jean, seven children and 14 grandchildren.

Full text: Former high-powered executives are finding themselves out of work and stepping into more traditionally female roles
As the 3 p.m. bell rang recently at the local elementary school, there were some unusual faces in the crowd of mothers and nannies outside: a half-dozen or so fathers, part of the growing ranks of unemployed men in this affluent New York suburb.
As they waited to whisk their children off for after-school snacks and play dates, these men, veterans of some of the most demanding, highest-paying professions in the country, exchanged news of their kids' activities, extending what one father, Jerry Levy, called the "secret dad handshake."
Mr. Levy, 46, who lost his job at a hedge fund last summer, greeted Andrew Emery, 45, who worked in insurance and has been unemployed for a year.
They are among the 5.1 million people across the United States who have lost jobs in a recession that has put more men than women out of work, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labour Statistics.
In Pelham Manor, unemployed fathers can now be seen at elementary school and grocery stores, or walking with children along the quiet streets, taking their places, by necessity, in the largely women's world of child care, housework and school life.
Tom Imperato, 62, whose real estate business has been devastated, discovered that there is no line at Costco at 11:30 a.m., now that he does the food shopping for his wife and nine-year-old twin daughters.
Mr. Levy joined the Parent Teacher Association and immediately noticed that he tends to tackle matters with a bluntness honed in the financial industry, while the women, whether stay-at-home mothers or professionals, he said, communicate more diplomatically.
Mr. Emery went from rushing past his children in the morning on the way to work and saying goodnight by phone to being a full-time father whose wife is the breadwinner. Along with the family dog, Bollo, he seems omnipresent here.
Susan Gilbert, principal of Siwanoy Elementary School, recently called her teachers to a meeting to discuss the implications of all the fathers showing up for pickup.
"There are dads on the lawn I've never met before," Ms. Gilbert recalled telling her staff at the 300-student school. "We've got kids who are feeling stressed. There are a lot more issues. There's more aggression, more sadness. We have to be cognizant that there are families that may be going through things that we are not aware of."
The new prevalence of fathers around town is bittersweet for mothers, teachers and others. On the one hand, the PTA can use all the help it can get from men with financial expertise at a time when the proposed school budget is under enormous pressure. And women are happy to see stay-at-home husbands building closer relationships with their children. But one little-spoken effect is an uneasy feeling that these highly successful men are facing the pain and potential shame of being out of work.
"A man is supposed to hunt and gather and bring home and provide, and when they don't, that goes to their identity," said Jane Robbins, a PTA member. "If they can find some solace in being the parent, if they can take that out of it, God bless them."
For Mr. Emery, who was a senior member of his firm, there have been plenty of days over the past year when he wakes up and says to himself, "Ugh, not this again." He quit his job last year ahead of expected layoffs, optimistic that he would soon find work. Now, with his savings evaporating, he said he regrets that he didn't wait to be laid off so that he could collect unemployment; the maximum weekly benefit in New York State is $405 (U.S.), with $25 added recently by the federal government.
His wife, Lea, works full-time as the deputy director of a nearby art museum, but the couple is facing the cold fact that they cannot sustain their lives in this village on her salary alone.
"To go from the 24-7, high-end deal-making prestige of working for places that are written about in newspapers to this, it took a long time to get comfortable," said Mr. Emery, who had also worked for the insurance company Chubb for 20 years.
"It was a big part of my identity; it's who you are. It's humbling - you start showing up and you're the only dad at the school. It took me a long time to fill in the blank when people asked me what I do, not to be able to say 'I work for a Fortune 500 company.' If people ask, I'll answer, but I won't put it out there."
Like other out-of-work fathers here, he said that unemployment, while wrenching, has also forced him to find opportunity in dramatically altered lives that involve spending long hours with the children. At school recently, Mr. Emery collected Alison, 8, and Aidan, 5, grabbing their knapsacks and walking to the family's Dutch Colonial-style home. "Alison, have you got homework?" he asked his daughter.
But one uncomfortable aspect of his new life, Mr. Levy said, is a certain loss of power. "At work, you are used to everyone listening to you - assistants, accounting, the middle office, sales coverage and outside vendors," he said. "But try to get your four children to listen to you."
He has zealously bounded into the PTA, becoming its liaison to the Pelham Board of Education on financial matters. Recently, he announced his candidacy for a seat on the school board, a move applauded by several long-time PTA members.
"I hope all these good guys who need good jobs find them," said Gina Fidele, a PTA president. "But I also hope that maybe this taste of what it's like to be more involved - not just taking the kids to school, but really helping to organize and direct the policies in the community. I hope they are having some experience that they'll find engaging and that they'll want more of it, even when they have that career back."

Full text: Architect Tony Robins is ramping up production at his Surrey plant, looking to feed a renewed interest in cost-effective prefabricated houses
Architect Tony Robins leans in close to inspect a kitchen cabinet that carpenter Ben Scott is finishing.
The mitre - the 45-degree-angle edge - has to fit just so and, like so many other projects in Mr. Robins' 30-year Vancouver-based career, God is in the details.
Of course, it's helpful that the architect, builders, sanders and table saws are all in the same place. For this is no ordinary building site. It's the headquarters of Mr. Robins' newly minted company Preform Construction, which is producing rather extraordinary prefab houses, 10 units at a time.
Here, at a 20,000-square-foot manufacturing plant in an industrial area of Surrey, B.C., chosen for its proximity to river barges for easy transport, Mr. Robins' simple yet sophisticated vision of modular prefabs is unfolding at an impressive rate: roughly two months from start to finish for a basic unit.
"We've had over a 130 inquiries already," says the architect, who recently revealed his design for a 500-square-foot unit in a palette of steel, glass and wood to an enthusiastic audience at a B.C. home show in Vancouver.
While his Japanese-style minimalism and industrial aesthetic - exemplified by the Robins-designed restaurant Watermark on Vancouver's Kits Beach - appeals, he admits that his inspiration for the prefabs was born of an innate sense of practicality. While designing a house for a remote site near Tofino, he realized that prefabs would be one way of reducing the costs of barging in equipment, workers and materials.
And his timing was perfect. In these recessionary times, there is a renewed interest in cost-effective prefabs. Mr. Robins' units also feature the appealing equation of pragmatic equals green equals smart design.
"It worked out that practical considerations that were to our advantage in terms of cost-cutting also turned out to be very green solutions," Mr. Robins says.
Using local suppliers, for instance, means there is less cost and a smaller footprint for materials, as does the use of recycled woods. A green roof helps increase insulation and reduce energy consumption, and a warmboard in-floor heating system runs at a lower temperature than normal. And since Mr. Robins had to maximize space in the small, 500-square-foot base units, he designed 10-foot-high ceilings and extensive glazing to create a sense of light and openness. He also lowered the bathroom ceiling to create storage and a mechanical space that was just the right size for an instantaneous water heater.
The prefab's many smart features are also inherently green. A monitoring system, for instance, allows owners to control heating and electrical systems remotely by computer.
But before Mr. Robins can design a unit for a client, there are some initial practical considerations. Getting the shipping company to drive the road to the site, for example, is key, to make sure there aren't any obstacles to transporting the house from the barge to the site.
The next step is to work with the client to determine exactly what they want. For the basic units, there is an array of choices to be made among materials, appliances and finishes that affect price and style.
Inquiries have come in as to whether these units could be converted into float homes or laneway housing, but for now most of them are intended for more remote, vacation home type sites.
But this is merely Mr. Robins' prêt-à-porter collection. His couture items are his custom-designed range of prefabs. At work on four large custom designed homes destined for Tofino, the Gulf Islands and the Sunshine Coast, Mr. Robins' design prowess shines through his technique. The prix de Rome award winner responds organically to specific sites with great effect.
A home for a jewellery designer overlooking a 100-foot cliff on Pender Island is a simple yet elegant paean to the power of landscape. Its Japanese proportions and extensive glazing make it a small jewel in itself, reflecting and embracing the sea and sky.
A 6,000-square-foot home destined for Tofino, with its elongated rectangular lines, speaks to both the ruggedness and beauty of its surroundings, its steel columns and local recycled cedar siding softened by a glass-sided infinity pool.
It's hard to believe these are prefabs at all, and that they originate here in this unassuming factory. But Mr. Robins' love of craft, attention to detail and precision make this an ideal arrangement. The relationship between builder and architect is unusually intimate and especially satisfying.
"There was a moment," recalls Mr. Robins wistfully, "when we finished the first unit and Mike [Dykstra, his principal builder] and I just stood there looking at it. It was a perfectly made piece that we'd overseen from start to finish, working together. We couldn't stop smiling."

Full text: Superkül's Georgian Bay home makes an argument for inspired cottage design
With the Victoria Day holiday less than a month away, many Toronto cottagers are eagerly looking forward to the May afternoon when they can flee the city for the first time this year and disappear among the beautiful islands and lakes of Ontario's northland.
Where they end up will be a matter of taste and budget. It may be something along the lines of the rustic pitched-roof shacks that small-town ministers and teachers put up for themselves in the early years of the past century. (This would certainly be my preference.) Or, less fortunately, it may be a monster home that appears to have been helicoptered in from some Toronto suburb.
For one Toronto family of four, however, the destination will be a getaway house in sharp contrast both to the traditional cottage and to the recently fashionable (and always awful) cottage-country mansion. It's a low-slung modernist house perched on a rugged 18-acre granite island in Georgian Bay - radical in inspiration, refined in detail, snugly positioned on its rocky, exposed site.
Designed by Margaret Graham and Andre D'Elia, partners in the Toronto firm Superkül Inc., this cedar-clad cottage, completed last year, has already been weathered down by the winter wind and snow to an attractive silvery grey. Other aspects of the material palette, such as the elegant, modestly scaled fireplace of dry-laid ledge limestone, help smooth the house's visual relationship with its vivid natural context.
Still, the cottage stands out vigorously from all that surrounds it and declares its freedom from the architectural traditions of the region. There is no decoration, no references to old-fashioned buildings, nothing to distract from its contemporary feel and character. The project is composed of two rectangular blocks set down parallel to each other, and separated by a walkway, on a spacious cedar deck boosted above the rocks. These blocks are also separated by use: one for the living room and dining area and kitchen, the other for bedrooms. The roofs slope upward along the lengthier axes of both elements, terminating in high walls opened by large windows.
The arrangement and size of the windows is especially interesting. Unlike more conventional Georgian Bay cottages, braced against the sometimes savage weather that surges across the district, Superkül's house is open to nature in all directions and at all times of the day, encouraging wide views through tall windows of water, rock and sky. In their classic formulations of what they believed, architectural modernists always argued strongly against dark, opaque walls, which shut out light and air, and for lightness and transparency. This silvery, glassy house, then, is a modernist dream come true, though raised in a wilder part of the world than the old modernists ever designed for.
But the forthright rejection of local architectural traditions by Ms. Graham and Mr. D'Elia raises again certain questions that often come to mind when thinking about construction in Ontario's superb cottage country. Are local traditions, which come out of those humble, pitched-roof shacks I mentioned, really so bankrupt that a whole new approach to building is called for? Is modernism an appropriate style for buildings in the landscape of Tom Thomson and the Group of Seven?
To the first question, I would answer no. Creative cottage-country architects will always be ransacking the built heritage of the past for ideas and putting them to work in cottages that blend in well with traditional designs. In these pages and elsewhere, I have written about very successful cottage designs that have emerged not from a renunciation of the past, but from a fruitful dialogue with it. I know the thing can be done.
Answering my second question is slightly more complicated. The real enemy of good sense and good art in cottage country, after all, is not the thoughtful, imaginative building, whatever its style. Superkül's new house on Georgian Bay, for example, is an intelligent and sensitively designed building, and for that reason it is a welcome piece of architecture. Never mind that it is cast in a modernist idiom. It works.
The curse of cottage country, rather, is the city or suburban home that has been heedlessly plunked down up north without serious thought about either the landscape or any cultural precedents, whether traditional or modernist. I have seen some of these monstrosities sprawling gracelessly over their properties by the water's edge. It appears that no municipal agency, or anything else, can stop their construction. Until someone takes responsibility for the aesthetics of cottage country, I fear that these eyesores will continue to proliferate.
Until then, we should appreciate clients who take the trouble to hire good architects, such as Ms. Graham and Mr. D'Elia, to provide them with holiday homes in the north. With any luck, the results will be enrichments of Ontario's architecture of escape.
Can't get enough
Superkül?

Full text: 95 GEORGE APPLETON WAY, NO. 2180
ASKING PRICE: $159,900
SELLING PRICE: $151,320
DAYS ON THE MARKET: six
Listed for less than $160,000, this one-year-old bachelor pad was such an attractively priced package that local renters were convinced to take out a mortgage to get it, agent Malcolm Austin says. "It's more or less the same as paying rent," he says. "If the market does go up ... you're building equity."
Part of a stacked condominium townhouse complex, the unit has a street-level entrance that opens into a living space of more than 500 square feet.
There are laminate floors throughout, a balcony overlooking a quiet, tree-filled green space, and a kitchen completed with ceramic tile finishes, stainless steel appliances and a breakfast bar.
"Most things in this price range are in pretty tacky condition, but these [units] are quite new," Mr. Austin says.
The suite comes with a four-piece bathroom and laundry facilities, as well as a locker and two parking spots in the garage. A monthly fee of $123 pays for common elements.
Another highlight is the property's location, just minutes from Highway 401, shopping centres, a hospital, library and public transit.

Abstract: There is a long trail of events that led the community of Campbell River, B.C., to boost TimberWest's tax bill to $1-million from $75,000, a decision that the city council is now backing away from. (That sum alone wouldn't be fatal to TimberWest, but if all the forestry towns on Vancouver Island were to follow suit, the resulting bill would absorb one-third of the company's earnings.)

Bigger property tax bills are never fun, but less so when you find out about it from a reporter's telephone call - and much less so when you find out that your tax tab is rising by 1,233 per cent.
TimberWest Forest Corp. TWF.UN-T was at the receiving end of that call, and that tax grab, last Friday. TimberWest's Stephen Bruyneel tries to be diplomatic in describing the company's reaction, but even so he acknowledges there was shock. After the shock wore off, the next thought was - why?
There is a long trail of events that led the community of Campbell River, B.C., to boost TimberWest's tax bill to $1-million from $75,000, a decision that the city council is now backing away from. (That sum alone wouldn't be fatal to TimberWest, but if all the forestry towns on Vancouver Island were to follow suit, the resulting bill would absorb one-third of the company's earnings.)
The somewhat complex rationale for Campbell River's move was that TimberWest is turning some of its forestry lands into real estate developments, so the company should pay tax on its entire portfolio of forest land as if it would shortly become condos.
The simple fact, however, is that the municipal politicians in Campbell River, and in many other struggling resource sector towns in B.C., haven't come to grips with the inescapable reality that the boom times of the forestry industry are gone, and unlikely to return.
So the old ways of taxing the local forestry company in the first, last and every instance simply will not work any longer. That outdated attitude has already killed some players in the forestry sector - witness Skeena's death grapple with Prince Rupert earlier this decade - and will kill again unless B.C. towns (and the province) move to end the decades-long practice of hitting forestry firms with high taxes in order to keep residential levies low.
That brings us back to Campbell River and TimberWest. For years, the city had been talking with another large forestry firm, Catalyst Paper Corp., about cutting an outsized tax bill. That company had already negotiated a modest tax break, seeing its bill fall to $5.2-million last year from $5.9-million in 2004. But Catalyst was pushing for a much larger tax reduction, in Campbell River and three other Vancouver Island communities. All told, Catalyst wanted to slash its tax bill to $6-million from an estimated $23-million.
It was a reasonable enough position: Catalyst chief executive officer Richard Garneau pointed out in a January letter that his company has been subsidizing low residential taxes, with homeowners in the community of North Cowichan paying only $100 a year, on average, after taking into account a provincial tax rebate. Mathematically speaking, Mr. Garneau is impeccably correct.
Politically speaking, however, the picture is not quite as clear. Forestry companies, for example, don't vote, and don't turn up at council meetings to shout mean words into microphones. Mr. Garneau didn't exactly help his cause, either, in his January letter, in which he issued a brusque ultimatum: "Therefore, on July 1, 2009, Catalyst intends to pay only for the cost of municipal services it consumes in each of the four municipalities, estimated to be approximately $1.5-million per community, or $6-million in total, down from $23-million. We really have no choice."
Yes, there were talks between Catalyst and municipal governments before and after the letter. But any hope of a quiet resolution that mayors could then sell to voters disappeared the moment the ultimatum became public. As a result of Catalyst's push to slash its tax bill, Campbell River and other municipalities have been scrambling to plug the hole in their budgets - including the short-lived proposal to raise TimberWest's tax bill by an astonishing 1,233 per cent.
TimberWest has reached a compromise that will see it pay a higher rate of tax on lands that are imminently headed for real estate development, with Campbell River agreeing to expedite zoning approvals. But the incident underscores the air of unreality that still pervades the logging towns of British Columbia, an assumption that forestry companies can pick up the tab for everybody else. What's to be done?
In the long term, the only real solution is to increase residential taxes substantially - not an easy sell in a recession. But the alternative is to hold the line on industrial levies, and watch as punitive taxes axe the forestry industry.

Full text:   Creditors get their elbows out when 'DIP' lenders jump to the front of the queue
jmcnish@globeandmail.com
***
AbitibiBowater Inc. ABH-T had every reason to believe it was one of the lucky ones.
Strapped for cash to pay $6-billion (U.S.) of debts in a sputtering newsprint market, the crippled giant still had what it took to win the attentions of one of the world's most prominent lenders. Earlier this month, GE Capital was so convinced of AbitibiBowater's long-term future that it was finalizing a $600-million emergency infusion, known as a debtor-in-possession or DIP loan, to sustain a company headed for bankruptcy proceedings.
If signed, AbitibiBowater would have landed a rare major DIP loan at a time when conventional lenders have all but disappeared from corporate bailouts.
But it wasn't to be. Two weeks ago, with no warning, GE Capital pulled the loan off the table and faded away like ink on a newspaper. The abrupt retreat left AbitibiBowater with little choice but to cede what it described in court documents as "extraordinary" rights to a set of replacement DIP lenders. The generous terms are the latest in a series of power grabs by bankruptcy lenders that have triggered a handful of messy and time-consuming creditor battles.
"He who controls the DIP controls the process these days," said Aubrey Kauffman, a restructuring specialist with Fasken Martineau DuMoulin LLP.
AbitibiBowater lost virtually all of its negotiating leverage with potential DIP lenders when GE Capital left it stranded.
"That jolted everybody," said one person close to AbitibiBowater.
After what sources described as five frantic days and nights of talks with potential lenders including Goldman Sachs & Co., AbitibiBowater and its legal team at Stikeman Elliott LLP and Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison LLP were unable to strike a replacement deal with conventional lenders.
Instead, it was forced to tap two of its major investors - Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd. and Avenue Capital Group - and the Quebec government for a total of about $300-million in DIP loans. If certain conditions are met, the company can borrow as much as $700-million.
A voluminous 252-page credit agreement negotiated by Fairfax's lawyers at Torys LLP and Shearman Sterling LLP and Avenue Capital's New York firm Kramer Levin Naftalis & Frankel LLP essentially vaulted the two investors from a lowly perch as largely unsecured creditors to high-ranking lenders with the right to effectively veto most major decisions, such as asset sales.
Restructuring loans have been a lucrative business for decades for adventurous lenders such as GE Capital and CIT Group. DIP lending pays high interest rates, rich fees and, typically, the loans rank ahead of most other debts.
Defaults are rare on DIP loans, but lenders have largely pulled away from the market because of fears that losses will rise as the global recession deepens. Moody's Investors Service has become so concerned about DIP loans that it recently started to rate them to reflect the risks of possible defaults.
Against this backdrop, most companies don't have much choice but to swallow tough terms demanded by those willing to wager a DIP loan.
These days, most troubled companies can raise DIP loans only from a short list of affiliated companies, existing investors and, in some cases, governments that are willing to protect their existing investments or political interests by lending emergency funds.
"The only people who are willing to come forward are people who already have a vested stake in the company and want to preserve their interests through a DIP loan," said Robert Chadwick, a Goodmans LLP lawyer who represents a number of AbitibiBowater bondholders.
These loans don't always sit well with other creditors, some of whom are pushing back against what they call overgenerous loans. The result is heightened tension between creditors, and delays for managers who are racing against the clock to right their corporate ships in turbulent waters.
Dutch-based petrochemical giant LyondellBasell Industries found itself in the middle of an international bank shoving match when it negotiated a record $8-billion (U.S.) DIP loan with a syndicate of banks in January to tide it through bankruptcy court proceedings. At least one bank, ABN Amro, was so infuriated that it threatened to walk away from the bailout because it argued that the big DIP loan weakened its claim to company assets set aside as collateral for its $3.4-billion loan.
Other unsecured creditors were so angered that some made moves to claim assets from LyondellBasell affiliates that were operating outside court protection. The mess has kept LyondellBasell and its lawyers busy in a variety of courts seeking orders to stop the creditor raids.
Creditors of the company that owns the Philadelphia Inquirer started complaining when they read the fine print in a $25-million (U.S.) DIP loan and discovered that the lender, a real estate developer, protected the job and pay raise of the company's chief executive officer, Brian Tierney. Shortly after the company won protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, Mr. Tierney agreed to give up his raise.
Creditors of Circuit City's Canadian chain, The Source, found themselves in a cross-border tug of war about the terms of a $1.3-billion DIP loan that was arranged for the U.S.-based retailer by a syndicate of its existing banks led by Bank of America. When The Source's Canadian creditors began to read the small print, "the plot thickened," said Fasken's Mr. Kauffman, who represents one of the subsidiary's suppliers.
What the creditors discovered was that the U.S. parent had agreed to hand the DIP lenders the right to seize most the assets of the healthy Canadian unit. The arrangement earned a rare rebuke from a court-appointed monitor and an Ontario judge set aside a portion of Canadian assets to protect local creditors.
Orestes Pasparakis, an Ogilvy Renault LLP lawyer who represented Bank of America in the Circuit City filing, defended the terms of the U.S. DIP as the necessary price of a loan that was urgently needed to keep a troubled retailer operating. In the end, the U.S. parent was forced to liquidate, but he said the DIP loan, which has been fully repaid, allowed the healthier Canadian unit to keep paying its bills while it restructured. "The Canadian stores would not have had the luxury of exploring its options had it not been for that loan," he said.

Abstract: Still, the old kitchen supply store Duikelman may be the clearest barometer of the neighbourhood's change. Open since 1940, it's crammed with utensils evolved from Holland's lactose- and caffeine-laced cuisine, such as a two-handled cheese knife akin to a miniature whipsaw and a no-fail milk foamer shaped like a fishnet. But these days demand from de Pijp's new house-proud residents has spawned two branches.

Full text:   In open-minded Amsterdam, where stolid burghers welcomed the Sixties and ladies of the evening ply their trade alongside tulips and the Night Watch, commerce has long cohabited easily with the avant-garde. Over the past few years, the Dutch blend of enterprise and innovation has galvanized two unlikely neighbourhoods. The Eastern Docklands near Central Station, once a 19th-century cargo port, is becoming a laboratory for contemporary architecture and city living, and De Pijp, an immigrant quarter just south of the central city, is drawing young professionals and the boutiques that love them.
De Pijp
In the 1980s, de Pijp was a rough-around-the-edges home to newcomers from more than 100 countries. At the tail end of the 1960s, when I lived in a studentenhuis nearby, it was known as a place to find cheap ethnic eats, flea market stalls peddling Second World War memorabilia, and a few working girls. ( De Pijp - "the pipe" - is also Dutch slang for the male organ.) Recent construction of a subway line, set to open in 2013, has kick-started development, spurred by a torrent of young financial types seeking reasonably priced real estate in this space-starved city.
"Six years ago, when my friends and I came to Amsterdam to study, this was a rare neighbourhood close to the centre that students could afford," says 27-year-old Cyril Vink, an information technology industry headhunter and son of a close friend from my student days. De Pijp has got livelier over the past few years, he notes, with bars and restaurants replacing Middle Eastern groceries.
"I've seen property values shoot up nearly 400 per cent in the last few years," says Vink, who like many of his real-estate-savvy peers has combined several small flats here into a roomy loft.
In the past generation, little seems to have changed at de Pijp's century-old flea market, Albert Cuyp Market, where most of the 300-plus vendors appear to be hawking the same melange of second-hand dinner jackets, herring and chocolate genitalia as they were in 1969. But now traditional establishments such as De Peperbol, a spice-crammed booth emitting the heady aroma of a Dutch East India Company ship, co-exists with newcomers such as Bazar Amsterdam, a trendy Middle Eastern spot transformed with hand-painted Iranian tiles from an old church into a coolhunter's idea of the Thousand and One Nights .
Nightlife throbs around the central square, Gerard Douplein. Here, tables spilling out of cozy "brown bars" such as Het Paardje - which lacks tobacco-stained walls, thanks to a recent smoking ban - mingle with the overflow from posh establishments such as WynBar. It's a tangle of beer, wine and bonhomie around an eccentric sculpture built from discarded cookie moulds.
Aging aunties are celebrated at the kitschy bakery café De Taart van m'n Tante - My Auntie's Cake - where young style-makers take tea on overstuffed chairs amid a field of fake tulips, flanked by a spun-sugar Elvis wailing on his confectionery guitar, and a freshly baked Superman saving a gumdrop metropolis. Aspiring Hansels and Gretels can stay at a bed and breakfast, Cake Under My Pillow, which is less messy than its name implies.
Still, the old kitchen supply store Duikelman may be the clearest barometer of the neighbourhood's change. Open since 1940, it's crammed with utensils evolved from Holland's lactose- and caffeine-laced cuisine, such as a two-handled cheese knife akin to a miniature whipsaw and a no-fail milk foamer shaped like a fishnet. But these days demand from de Pijp's new house-proud residents has spawned two branches.
The Eastern Docklands
On the other side of Central Station, a futuristic version of Venice is rising on wind-whipped man-made islands abandoned in the 1970s when Amsterdam's cargo port moved out of the city.
While restaurants and boutiques are sprouting on the wharves of several European cities, including Dusseldorf and Hamburg, the socially conscious Dutch saw even grander possibilities including city homes for families, accessible living for seniors and studio space for artists. Along these canals, young parents on bikes with kiddie seats outnumber tattooed hipsters.
This zone is also a playground for young architects - who are ripping neglected factory buildings open to the light and reimagining the Renaissance-era canal house in distressed metals and glass. These repopulated islands are connected by fanciful bridges shaped like arching cobras or a flock of soaring birds, and their wharves are lined with a crazy quilt of houseboats, from sleek pleasure cruisers to gritty work vessels draped with wildflowers.
KNSM-laan, a street once favoured by squatters, now thrives with design stores anchored by the renowned interior design studio Pols Potten, the lighthearted lifestyle store Sissy-Boy Homeland, a multicoloured explosion of children's clothing and games at Keet in Huis, and Arrival/Departure with its fresh take on mid-century fashions - like a vampy Swing Era-style dress from the retro label Stop
Staring.
For fine dining, Jamie Oliver's Fifteen, which like its London sibling takes on at-risk youngsters as apprentices, is flourishing in a warehouse hung with crystal chandeliers. While the white-tablecloth section serves a four-course set menu, the less formal trattoria offers free choice of vibrant dishes sourced from local farms, including rich lamb shoulder ragu with rosemary and palate-twisting desserts such as panna cotta with rhubarb and prosecco-mascarpone ice cream.
An iconic place to spend the night is the Lloyd Hotel, a commanding monument to early Amsterdam School architecture - the Dutch version of art deco. This unorthodox establishment offers one-star bath-in-the-hall accommodations alongside sprawling five-star suites with unusual amenities, such as a grand piano or a bed that sleeps eight.
Yet my ballroom-size five-star room with 25-foot windows had the distinction of being both dramatic and less than comfortable. With its double bed moored in a corner like a foundering ship in the ocean and a loo boasting 1920s atmosphere with amenities to match, this particular accommodation was a bit too redolent of its past lives as a clerk-filled shipping office and a dorm for errant juveniles. Next time, I'll go for a stylish one-star ($160) that bears few traces of its days as a post-Second World War detention centre for Dutch collaborators.
Still, the lure of the Lloyd is less in its billets than in its distinctive clientele, an eclectic mix of European creative types who gather around a communal table for farm-style breakfasts of yeasty baguettes, crackling croissants and homemade cakes before heading upstairs to the hotel's Cultural Embassy, a clubby hotline to Amsterdam's music and art scene.
But which neighbourhood will nurture the next wave of hopefuls arriving with a sketch pad and dream? Amsterdam's intrepid town fathers have started rolling out the welcome mat in the Red Light District, converting former bordellos into studio space for clothing stylists and jewellers with the help of celebrated design firms such as Droog and Moooi.
And after that? As avant-garde boutiques blossom between shop windows displaying more corporeal pleasures, Amsterdam's once iconic smoking coffee shops may look so endearingly antiquated the next generation may feel compelled to launch a preservation movement on their
behalf.

Full text:   "Hey, I'm walkin' here!
I'm walkin' here!"
- Ratso Rizzo,
Midnight Cowboy , 1969
Attitude: It's what makes New York great. Dustin Hoffman's sad sack Rizzo had it. So did Robert De Niro's psycho Travis Bickle or Joe Pesci's "goodfella" Tommy DeVito. The average guy driving a hack or the lady at the corner dry cleaners has even more.
If New York buildings could talk, they'd have it too: "You got a problem with concrete, Toronto guy? Are we too harsh for your namby-pamby sensibilities? Well get over it!" That's what a trio of 30-storey towers in Greenwich Village would say to us if they could.
Andrew Berman will do until then. As executive director of the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation, he's been speaking for the New York University-owned buildings since 2003, when he wrote a four-page letter to the Landmarks Preservation Commission asking that Silver Towers be awarded landmark status. With true New York attitude, Mr. Berman threw around phrases such as "stylish" and "visually sensual" about the 1960s I.M. Pei-designed brutalist towers; he had the chutzpah to remind the commission that the "monolithic" complex was the product of mid-century urban renewal practices (also known as slum clearance), which, in essence, erased the existing street grid and created a "superblock."
In most cities, these are things to be ashamed of, are they not?
"The reality is, we have big eyes and a broad understanding of what is good design and what makes our neighbourhood work and it's not limited simply to 19th-century townhouses," says Mr. Berman, 40, who is no doubt responsible for getting landmark recognition for dozens of charming townhouses, too, since his appointment to the GVSHP in 2002. "We understand how some of the great works of architecture in our neighbourhood contribute ... very significantly to the history of urban design nationally and internationally."
The commission agreed. Last November, the three towers, the space between them and most of the superblock - including original landscaping and an enormous concrete Pablo Picasso sculpture - became a protected landmark.
The successful "weaving" of disparate design and programmatic mandates from multiple bureaucratic layers had much to do with the decision to landmark the complex. In the early 1960s, legendary urban planner Robert Moses assembled three Greenwich Village city blocks into one superblock and gave it to NYU for campus expansion. Neighbourhood opposition over the loss of affordable housing forced the university to use just two buildings for faculty housing and give over the third to villagers to run as a co-op. For design credibility, Mr. Pei and associate James Ingo Freed were selected in 1966 and Norweigan sculptor Carl Nesjär was brought in to execute the construction of the 60-ton concrete Bust of Sylvette, an enlargement of a sculpture by Picasso.
While Silver Towers may strike the casual observer as just another set of unremarkable concrete slabs, that Mr. Pei was able to arrange the buff-coloured, poured-in-place towers in a pinwheel plan, animate them via deep-set windows, pay homage to the existing street grid with "visual thoroughfares" (like our own Alexandra Place by Jerome Markson, Klein & Sears and WZMH) and thoughtfully consider the pedestrian experience means that there is much more than meets the eye. It's a delicate solution to shoehorning modernism into "one of the oldest neighbourhoods in New York City," says Mr. Berman. "That's what makes this complex so worthy of recognition."
Which is not to say the idea didn't meet with resistance. NYU, for instance, was "vehement" in their opposition at first and came around only after the writing was on the wall; a few LPC members couldn't wrap their heads around why such an anti-Jane Jacobs complex should be celebrated until they were schooled in Modernism 101; still other critics accused the GVSHP of sneakily using heritage as a shield to prevent redevelopment the site...until they gazed upon the list of architectural luminaries supporting the landmarking effort.
"Obviously this is relatively new ground," explains Mr. Berman. "I think there's going to continue to be resistance to a lot of this kind of architecture, but hopefully this designation makes it a little bit easier to understand and accept that concrete high rises do not necessarily equal bad architecture and urban renewal does not necessarily equal bad architecture - in fact in some cases it equals great architecture."
So, what about all that great Toronto concrete architecture? Since Mr. Berman admits his job would have been "much, much harder" had Silver Towers not been designed by a legend (with a legendary artist's work in the courtyard), he suggests other cities warm up with projects by name architects first, then follow with local firms. Obviously, John Andrews's 1965 Scarborough College is an excellent place to start, as is the University of Toronto's 1973 Robarts Library by New York firm Warner Burns Toan & Lunde (with local good guys Mathers & Haldenby), which would then pave the way for buildings such as Peter Dickinson's 1958 tower at 14 Blevins Place in our very own slum-clearance project Regent Park (listed but not designated), and, perhaps, Clifford & Lawrie's early-70s Manulife Centre on Bloor St.
"Things that we treasure now," finishes Mr. Berman, "for generations were really reviled -whether it's art deco architecture or Victorian architecture; this is part of an ongoing and constant process."
A process that sometimes takes an attitude adjustment.

Full text:   Innocuous incidents can escalate into all-out assaults that lead to legal bills, health issues, marital strain - even force people from their dream homes. Zosia Bielski reports
As Jacqueline Desjardins's garage leaned precariously over her neighbour's lawn, the man would stand by watching, and laugh.
Later, the 74-year-old Sudbury woman would find her car scratched up, a spare tire slashed. Used oil containers appeared next to her well. And then there were the two-by-fours: Buried near the wobbly garage, they were spiked with thick, four-inch-nails that jutted upward. But things really heated up when her 78-year-old husband, Lucien Desjardins, accused his neighbour, Ahti Blick, of trying to run him down with his car.
The incidents were noted by Ontario Superior Court Judge Paul Kane this month when he fined Mr. Blick and Maija Blick $57,000 in damages for trying to sink the Desjardins' garage by digging trenches and running water underneath it with a garden hose.
It was the culmination of a feud that began decades earlier, pivoting entirely around the small garage: The Desjardins said it sat 17 inches from the lot line; the Blicks believed it encroached on their property. After many fruitless calls to police, Ms. Desjardins attempted to sell the house, but the notorious dispute meant no one was buying.
"It's not so much the digging that bothered me," Ms. Desjardins said. "He was standing there laughing at us."
The case highlights the exasperation of victims of neighbour rage, which in the worst of cases can force people from their dream homes, leave them with staggering legal costs and cause serious health issues, as well as marital strain.
Post-traumatic stress, anxiety, depression and loss of appetite were just some of the ailments suffered by Ralph Scala's neighbours on Quebec Avenue in the west-end Junction area of Toronto. There, Mr. Scala's seven-year reign of terror against 26 locals involved hired goons, as well as a tombstone and roadkill strewn on the lawn of one elderly victim.
Although Mr. Scala pleaded guilty to 49 charges and was banned from the area for three years, the damage was done: The neighbours' victim impact statements revealed intense fears of reprisal.
For nearly two years, the neighbours of Wychwood Park, an exclusive Toronto enclave, were similarly traumatized. Routinely, residents who parked on a narrow street had all four of their tires slashed. Neighbours were stunned when they learned Albert Fulton, the local archivist and Neighbourhood Watch leader, had been arrested. (After reports of the charges surfaced, Mr. Fulton committed suicide.)
Although the cases are extreme, each began innocuously enough, with what one neighbour perceived as a grave slight on the part of the other.
But such matters can quickly escalate, said Peter Bruer, manager of conflict resolution services at St. Stephen's Community House in Toronto, where 50 volunteer mediators help bickering neighbours talk it out face to face.
"We've seen situations that have driven people out of their homes. It could start with a leaky eavestrough that ices up somebody else's walkway."
Typical issues include parking, fences, garbage, flooding downspouts and barking dogs - or something that simply "gets under their skin." Although St. Stephen's receives roughly 500 calls a year, one-third of which are referred by police, just 100 make it to the meeting stage because one party is usually more keen than the other.
"In some cases, there is no law, and in other cases, there's a law but it's very hard to enforce," said Mr. Bruer, adding that neighbour disputes "boil down to the fact that people don't respect each other."Bill Saundercook, the city councillor in Mr. Scala's ward, deals with feuding neighbours three times a week. The most recent squabble involved water drainage between two houses.
"I can point to a troublemaker pretty much on every street in my ward that neighbours call and complain about. It's the cranky old man that's stealing the children's ball when it comes on his lawn or someone trying to get back at their neighbour by building their fence higher than they can," Mr. Saundercook said.
The councillor usually begins negotiations by phone. Failing that, he goes in person: "If I pay a visit to one, I pay a visit to the other."
As neighbours will tend to hastily call in lawyers and bylaw-enforcement officers, Mr. Saundercook finds himself cautioning them against full-scale attacks.
His advice: "You see your neighbours way more than you see your own family. If you decide to escalate a matter that might be trivial in its outset, then just do that with your eyes wide open."
To help prevent arguments from intensifying, Toronto's Municipal Licensing and Standards (which handles 110,000 calls annually) ran its 130 investigators through alternative dispute resolution training in 2006. The program gives officers better tools to mend grudges.
While private property can "increase the energy" because owners have invested money and time, Mr. Bruer says St. Stephen's also gets many calls from renters and roommates "driven crazy by the close proximity of somebody else's lifestyle that interferes with their lifestyle."
As urban density intensifies, feuding neighbours may become a liability for real estate agents as well.
"If you know that the neighbour's a crank, you have to say they're a crank," especially when representing the buyers, said Toronto broker Chander Chaddah. "Clients are owed full disclosure of any information that you as a practitioner may be in position of that could have an impact on their decision making. ... It's part of our code of business practices."
When Mr. Chaddah took prospective buyers to a client's home on Quebec Avenue, the street where Mr. Scala terrorized his neighbours and where his incapacitated mother still lives, the buyers grew worried: Mr. Scala may return in three years. (Police have told neighbours to keep their surveillance equipment at the ready and keep detailed notes on suspicious activity.)
As for the Desjardins, they will once again square off against the Blicks on April 25, this time for court costs. The families are still neighbours, but the Desjardins have installed three security cameras.
"I get up in the morning and I say to my husband, 'What is today going to bring?' " Ms. Desjardins said. "We never know."

Abstract: On a recent sunny day, one of the window tables at Waves was occupied by Wendy Pedersen, a vocal housing activist who's fought market condo developments and led gentrification tours of the neighbourhood. Introduced to Mr. [Cyrous Sharifpour], Ms. Pedersen urged him to make the shop welcoming to everybody, not just the well dressed or well heeled. As the conversation went on, police officers lined up for lattes and an unshaven man with a ponytail sat quietly at the counter looking out at the street.

Full text:   Owner of new coffee shop, with social housing upstairs, is betting on Downtown Eastside's future
There are plate-glass windows at a new coffee shop on the corner of Main and Cordova in Vancouver's Downtown Eastside.
There are no bars on these windows, as there are on those of a convenience store across the street. The stretch of glass might seem foolhardy in a neighbourhood with one of the highest property-crime rates in the city. Or it could be seen as a calculated risk, given that the Vancouver Police Department's Main Street station is across the street.
For Cyrous Sharifpour, the windows are a symbol.
"When you put bars up, you make things frightening," says Mr. Sharifpour, the franchisee at this location. "You make it a fearful environment for the customer."
Opened in March, this Waves - the 14th for the chain, founded in 2005 - is a bright, upscale place, with polished tables and free wireless. Startup costs for the turnkey operation were about $350,000.
And it's one of several businesses that have moved to the area in recent months, betting on the neighbourhood's future even as they fuel worries about gentrification.
Bean Around the World has a location on Gore Street, near two new condo projects. Tenants in Woodward's project on Hastings Street will include London Drugs and Nesters, a B.C. grocery chain. Les Amis du Fromage has opened its third retail outlet, and adjoining bistro, on East Hastings Street. Waves has another outlet nearby at Main and Pender.
There have been no more problems with crime or vandalism at Waves stores in the Downtown Eastside than anywhere else in the city, says founder Kami Rahmati. He'd snap up any property he could, if he could afford it.
Others have had the same idea. Developer interest put so much pressure on real-estate prices that the province stepped in, buying more than 20 single-room occupancy hotels in the Downtown Eastside since 2007 to protect low-income housing.
The Waves site used to be home to Vic's, a diner featured in television series Da Vinci's Inquest . The second floor of the two-storey building contained rooms rented by the month.
In 2003, Vancouver film director William Vince bought the Waves site and two other buildings in the same block in an ambitious plan to nurture the local arts scene. Mr. Vince, best known for directing the 2005 Oscar-nominated film Capote , died last year. The William Vince Foundation runs from offices in District 319, a restored movie house, and focuses on causes championed by Mr. Vince, including film and sports programs for kids.
For a while, the floor above Waves was used for office space. Community activists pushed the building's new owners to turn it back into low-income housing. Last month, the 11 rooms reopened as social housing, run by Atira Women's Resource Society and reserved for women 45 and older.
Waves has a 20-year lease, comprising a 10-year initial term and two, five-year options to renew. Atira has a three-year lease with an option to renew for another three-year term.
For now, the upscale newcomer coexists with its less glamorous neighbour. But in terms of long-term tenure, the coffee shop is more secure than the women upstairs.
On a recent sunny day, one of the window tables at Waves was occupied by Wendy Pedersen, a vocal housing activist who's fought market condo developments and led gentrification tours of the neighbourhood. Introduced to Mr. Sharifpour, Ms. Pedersen urged him to make the shop welcoming to everybody, not just the well dressed or well heeled. As the conversation went on, police officers lined up for lattes and an unshaven man with a ponytail sat quietly at the counter looking out at the street.
He can sit there as long as he wants, Mr. Sharifpour said.
"I have not had to ask anyone to leave," he said.

Full text:   How's it goin'? I'm doing pretty well, myself. Yeah. For sure.
No, I'm not fat, by the way. The other day, because I noted that the vast majority of characters on Harper's Island are obscenely thin, some people wrote to me and said, you know, I was just bitter. Because I must be overweight or huge and ugly. Revenge of the chortling skinnies kinda thing, I guess. I'm trim. So shut up.
Which reminds me. Coming soon from Fox (of course) is More to Love , a reality show featuring a group of "curvy women" who compete - just like you see on The Bachelor - for the affections of one charming guy whose attractions are described as "a big waist and an even bigger heart." Already, Fox is trawling the United States for what it calls "eligible plus-sized women" who want to go crazy on TV for some grinning dude.
As Fox's reality TV exec Mike Darnell pronounced, "For six years, it's been skinny-minis and good-looking bachelors, and that's not what the dating world looks like." As the critic for The Washington Post, a wonderful woman, put it, "Fat chicks have needs, too; Fox wants to be there for them."
Indeed. I'm telling ya here - the hits keep coming. There are many, many reality TV shows out there and more are coming. Some are incredibly crude. Many are cruel, obnoxious and foisted on a public that wants to be simultaneously shocked, titillated and appalled.
But we don't have to watch them. No sirree. Me, when not paying close attention to my diet and exercise, I'm a tad fed-up. I'm sick and tired of all the moaning about reality TV shows that are obviously in poor taste. Guess what? You don't have to watch them. Somebody else might watch, but getting all hoity-toity and condemning television, is pointless and ridiculous. Look, if you're going to be all fuss-budget and upset, there's no need to go out of your way to find these shows.
You want to be outraged? Here are some examples of reality TV shows that can irritate you. Then you can avoid them.
Fox (of course) is steaming ahead with Someone's Gotta Go , a reality series in which real, actual people who work in real, actual workplaces, bicker and debate about who should get fired to cut costs. Then the person is actually fired. You are probably wondering why people would agree to participate. Easy: There might be a shortage of job opportunities, but there is no shortage of people who just want to be on TV.
The Cougar is already running on the U.S. cable channel TV Land. "One older woman, 20 younger men. Watch as she narrows her choices and ultimately chooses one lucky man to be her soul mate." Yes, it follows fortysomething real-estate sales person Stacey Anderson, mother of four, as she chooses from among a group of smirking young men in their 20s. Several are younger than one of her sons. Coming this summer on The CW channel is the six-episode Hitched or Ditched , which is about couples who have been dating for years, and are given an ultimatum to either get married within the week, or just break up.
Oh yeah - People magazine claims that Nadya Suleman, known as "Octomom" since she gave birth to eight children a few months ago, will "probably sign a deal very soon to feature her and her family of 14 children in a reality TV show." Apparently Octomom has met with four production companies and will meet this week with certain network execs. It is reported that ideas being discussed are "episodes chronicling such themes as Suleman learning to drive a 14-passenger van, going on a date or having a big family Thanksgiving or Christmas."
There you go. Enjoy or avoid. Your call.

Also airing
Great Performances at The Met: Lucia di Lammermoor (PBS, 9 p.m.) This production stars what is called "the Met's brightest star," the dazzling Anna Netrebko. Soprano Netrebko, returning to the Metropolitan Opera stage for the first time since giving birth to a son in September, takes the demanding title role - a young woman driven to madness by love and politics. Piotr Beczala co-stars as Lucia's head-strong lover Edgardo. As dramatic as all get-out.
Shrink Rap (Documentary, 9 p.m.) is the most peculiar of talk shows. The host/inquisitor is former actress Pamela Stephenson, now a registered psychotherapist in Los Angeles, married to actor Billy Connolly and known sometimes as Dr. Pamela Connolly. In this series of in-depth interviews, made for British TV, she uses her psychological skills to interview the famous, often about highly sensitive topics. In this episode she talks to Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York. Stephenson discusses Ferguson's long-established rebellious nature and her difficult transition into the royal household. She also talks about her problems with her weight and self-image. The most commonly asked question in the series is "You really didn't get much nurturing as a child, did you?"
The Jon Dore Television Show (Comedy, 10 p.m.) reaches its season finale tonight. Dore's comedy is an acquired taste. His tactic is to play the moron who stumbles upon truth and reality. It's beyond deadpan, this style. In this episode, Dore delves into the world of drugs. He starts from the position that all drugs are bad. Then he interviews real people and learns, amazingly, that sometimes drugs can help people. Is it funny? Go figure. J.D.

Full text:   Husband, father, grandfather, coal miner, aircraft assembler, appraiser. Born Nov. 13, 1924, in Kingston upon Hull, England. Died Sept. 26, 2008, in Richmond Hill, Ont., of a heart attack, aged 83.
Ernie was born into a working-class family in northern England, and was raised by his mother Mary. He never knew his father, who had left the family shortly after he was born. His brother Ted, five years his senior, was charged with much of his care as Mary had to work to support the family. Even though most of Ernie's childhood was spent during the Depression, some of his fondest memories were of those times.
Ernie was in his final year of high school when the Second World War broke out. He was transferred from Hull, which was a target for German bombers, to the nearby seaside town of Scarborough. He and his classmates would often explore the local beaches, occasionally coming across sea mines that had washed ashore. The Home Guard would be notified and shoot at the mine until it detonated, much to the delight of Ernie and his friends.
After graduation, Ernie moved back with his family in Hull and began working. It was a bleak time, as food was rationed and the intensity of the nightly air raids increased. Ernie's home was damaged by a bomb that levelled a row of houses across the street. He and the neighbours spent the rest of the night digging survivors out of the rubble.
Ernie met his future wife, Phyllis, on his way to a party on Christmas Day. In 1942, he was called up to work in the coal mines. Ernie's first job was to tend to the "pit ponies" that pulled tubs of coal from the pit face.
In 1946, Ernie married
Phyllis, and with work difficult to come by, they decided to immigrate to Canada. With no particular destination in mind they settled in Toronto, as that was where their flight had landed.
Despite starting off with only a suitcase and a few dollars, by the early 1950s they had built a home in North York. It was during this time that Ernie worked at his favourite job, as a riveter for Avro. The next few years were exciting as he helped assemble the Arrow. Unfortunately, he lost his job along with 14,000 other Avro employees on "'Black Friday," the day the federal government cancelled the project.
Ernie, Phyllis and their son Terry moved north of Toronto and Ernie began selling real estate. His final job was as a property appraiser for Revenue Canada.
After Ernie retired, he enjoyed travelling with Phyllis to the Caribbean, American Southwest and back to England. He stayed active into his later years with photography, tending to his garden and playing with his grandson, Andrew. Whereas many people work at only one or two professions during their lives, he excelled at several.
Terry May is Ernie's son.

Africans are escaping the worst of the global crisis

Abstract: Another factor working in Africa's favour is its private companies' and consumers' low dependence on borrowed money. People tend to pay cash for goods and services, however costly. In the United States, loans for cars and homes - loans that now aren't being paid back - are the major factor behind the financial crisis. In Africa, very few people borrow money for such purchases.

Full text:   The United States suffers rising job losses. Britain nationalizes its banks. Once high-flying small economies such as Ireland, Hungary and Iceland break down. Even robust China and India are experiencing slower growth, curtailed ambitions and broken dreams.
Yet, in sub-Saharan Africa, there are few hints of the global financial crisis that is consuming the capitalist world.
In fashionable African cities, residential home prices remain stratospheric. A typical Western-style house in Kampala or Accra, for example, now costs an astonishing two to three times the price of a comparable home in Cleveland or other cities in the American heartland. While home prices are crashing from Madrid to Dublin and Miami to Los Angeles, African prices remain near or at record-high levels.
African banks, meanwhile, are rock-solid compared to their debt-heavy counterparts in the United States and Europe. While international bankers went bust by making legions of bad loans, African bankers stuck to earning profits the old-fashioned way: paying very little to depositors, and earning a big "spread" by buying guaranteed government debt, which yielded healthy returns.
Even government deficit spending, long the bane of Africa, seems positively puny compared with the massive debts that the United States and some European countries face.
And yet there are good reasons to believe that it is just a matter of time before Africa and its people experience the ill effects of the global crisis. From Ghana to Kenya, governments are having increased difficulty in raising money for infrastructure projects and selling official debt.
Foreign investment in sub-Saharan Africa, which reached record levels in recent years, is retreating, which is evidence of investor caution, not any underlying lack of optimism about the region. And exports of raw material to China, India, Europe and the United States, a key factor in Africa's recent growth surge, may suffer simply because the global slowdown means less consumption everywhere.
All of these factors suggest that an African financial bust is possible.
Popular equity investments, such as shares in the telecommunications firm Safaricom, are already trading at unexpectedly low levels. If real estate prices were to fall dramatically, a chain reaction could occur, taking down big and small investors alike, and over time causing wide suffering to ordinary Africans.
Even assuming stability in real estate prices, the global crisis surely will cause a fall in remittances by Africans working good jobs in Europe, the United States, Canada, Australia and the Middle East.
Immigration itself may even slow dramatically, depending on the length and depth of the economic slowdown. Fewer Africans working in rich countries will automatically translate into less money circulating in African countries.
The decline in remittances, however, cuts both ways. Remittances have long spurred inflation in many parts of Africa. A Ugandan doctor working in Norway, for instance, cares little about the cost of a beer in Kampala. He is also willing, and able, to pay more than a local doctor for services and, of course, a home in Uganda. Fewer remittances flowing into Uganda could mean less economic activity - or simply lower prices.
The financial meltdown in the United States, which incubated the global crisis, is either coming under control or threatening to mutate into a new, more virulent form that could destroy not only America's paper economy of trading and brokering, but also its real economy of goods and services.
President Barack Obama, acting as if the latter scenario remains likely, is betting on large-scale government spending to prop up the real economy. If his administration succeeds, the chances that Africa will remain relatively unscathed will grow.
Even if Obama fails, however, Africans should escape the worst of the global crisis, for both good reasons and bad. The good reasons have to do with African self-reliance and a growing awareness among scholars and policy makers that trade within the region - especially between urban and rural Africa - will ultimately deliver enormous benefits.
Another factor working in Africa's favour is its private companies' and consumers' low dependence on borrowed money. People tend to pay cash for goods and services, however costly. In the United States, loans for cars and homes - loans that now aren't being paid back - are the major factor behind the financial crisis. In Africa, very few people borrow money for such purchases.
Africa's cash-based economy has, in the past, constrained development. After all, by allowing people to spend more than they have, borrowed money can fuel growth. But today, the continent's pay-as-you-go practices are a powerful defence against financial contagion.
Another way of looking at Africa's paradoxical economic position is to admit that the region's historical marginalization within the international financial system, so costly in times of global plenty, is proving to be an unexpected benefit when the wealthiest of the world are sick unto death.

Full text:   Saskatchewan-based writer
I was at my local Hometown Foods last week when I bumped into a friend looking for the "new" James Bond film, Quantum of Solace . (Out here in the sticks, we don't always get into the city to see a new release, so the $1 movie rental aisle sees some pretty good action on weekends.)
Our casual conversation turned to the absurdly healthy state of Saskatchewan's economy - as it always seems to these days.
"I'm busier than ever," he proclaimed.
"Can you believe our GDP growth leads the nation?" I replied, feeling the kind of back-smacking kinship the bailed-out wealthy must enjoy after cashing a healthy bonus cheque from AIG.
My friend then confessed that a Saskatchewan relative, who now works in Toronto, recently told him that many folks out East thought we didn't "get" the recession and we kept spending, hiring and buying houses anyway.
"They thought we were too stupid to realize there was a worldwide recession going on," he laughed. (Saskatchewan had the highest increase in wholesale, retail and new vehicle sales in the country.)
I guess it's a small consolation to assume that Saskatchewan's misguided residents are stupidly overspending than to admit that Ontario has lost its economic clout to a mere bunch of sodbusters-turned-carpetbaggers.
In this once downtrodden Next Year Country, there was ample room for economic growth; it just took the right circumstances to set things in motion.
Our real estate was once as undervalued as singer-songwriter Ron Sexsmith, our natural resources remained as chaste as the Jonas Brothers, and our skilled youth were consigned to a grim life in the apocalyptic Alberta tar sands.
In a complete about-face, Saskatchewan's provincial job recruiters are gathering frequent-flier miles heading back and forth to seek more skilled labour in Ontario. "It's hard to get good help these days," we moan as we settle into our hot tubs clutching a craft beer out of the new aluminum cooler.
In a bid to keep our Vegas-style roll going, our provincial government recently introduced income tax cuts and infrastructure spending to ensure we continue to win at the tables. Hell, we even played host to three big lottery winners in March. Will there be enough stretch limos to ferry our nouveau riche around to overpriced Eagles concerts?
Next door, Friendly Manitoba is in the same "socially awkward" state of prosperity. As the Red River miraculously receded last week, those giddy optimists just announced a new football stadium for their Blue Bombers.
There aren't any foreclosure signs on my hometown streets - just new condos. In fact, we've had a flock of arrivistes move to Wakaw recently, pushed out by mounting urban house prices in nearby Saskatoon. Our humble streets are lined with bored young moms pushing strollers. These shack-wacky women loiter in front of the post office with their designer glasses and Lululemon yoga pants, looking very out of place in our pragmatic farm town.
"If only we had a Starbucks for the young people to congregate," I said to my partner, Grant, on the weekend. "I guess they'll have to start their own coffee row!" he laughed.
For those of you who must ride out the downturn in your own distressed region, watch for our own Robert Kurosaki-esque infomercial titled Rich Farmer, Poor Farmer.
"Act now! You, too, can learn the recession-beater secrets it took Saskatchewan farmers a century to perfect. Make your own fashionable flour-sack dresses, learn to 'put up' cucumbers, dig a root cellar and ferment your own dandelion wine," it would blast from your television with the intensity of a Ponzi-scheme pitch.
As for me, I've got my eye on some cheap real estate in sunny Scottsdale. Call me an insensitive Saskatchewan carpetbagger if you must, but I can't seem to stupidly stop spending.

Full text:   Some early signs of improvement in market psychology have started to take hold over the past three or four weeks. We have observed upbeat equity trends, improving liquidity in some important debt markets, a solid G20 meeting, retreating gold prices and even the beginnings of some asset-backed security issuances supported by the Term-Asset Backed Securities Loan Facility - most notably the recent bond issuance by Ford Motor Credit.
But while there are some emerging positives as this recession matures, the causal centre of the crisis in the United States - real estate - has still not been restored to full health. Some cogent reasoning suggests we could still have two to three years of adjustments ahead; particularly in the commercial side of the real estate sector, now that the residential sector has led the market downward and has already taken large lumps.
Two leading thinkers on the U.S. real estate bubble and its attendant effects, one a top-ranked real estate analyst and fund manager, the other a Nobel laureate economist, say we are probably a meaningful distance from an ultimate trough in valuations and a positive economic rebound. To various extents, their logic suggests that reallocations of investment monies, and moves to take on riskier investment positions, should continue to be made only cautiously from this point - at least until greater price stability appears to have returned.
Jonathan Litt: Top-ranked U.S. Real Estate Analyst and Fund Manager
In interviewing Jonathan Litt on the issue of U.S. and global real estate prices, and the conditions required for a gradual renewal of confidence, one's sense of caution tends to intensify. Mr. Litt is the founder and portfolio manager of the aptly named Land and Buildings Investment Management, which is focused on commercial real estate and real estate related equities. Prior to Land and Buildings, he was senior global real estate strategist at Citigroup, where he was responsible for property investment strategy, and where he led the No. 1 institutional investor, All American Real Estate Research Team, for eight years.
As the real estate bubble expanded in the mid-2000s, Mr. Litt sent bubble gum machines to his clients, symbolically telling them to avoid excessive valuations on commercial real estate debt. Scorned by many at the time, he and his clients have since watched the asset class tumble, and he remains highly skeptical about the current valuations in all major real estate asset classes, but particularly in commercial real estate where he thinks U.S. values will come down another 20 to 25 per cent. His portfolio is positioned accordingly.
Mr. Litt cites three main reasons for his negative outlook:
First: Historical commercial real estate values since 1970 have averaged yields of 9 per cent. In times of economic contraction and tight financial markets, those yields have been in the 10- to 12-per-cent range. Yet we are in the 9-per-cent range at the current time (on trailing Q4 results), and we are in a recession - a period where vacancies are rising, leases are not being renewed and spending is down. In Mr. Litt's opinion, this suggests yields on real estate values should be more like 10 to 12 per cent; implying potential drops in REIT (commercial real estate investment trust) prices of 20 per cent. He estimates this could take "two to four years, or even longer for the direct commercial real estate market to reprice, which will adjust more slowly than the publicly traded market."
Second: As pointed out in the chart, there is an enormous approaching wall of debt maturation in commercial real estate - some $600-billion in just the next two years. And because most lenders know that many of their real estate debtors are in trouble and could default if their debt lines were shut down, many are choosing instead to extend the term of the loans, deferring the ultimate repayment of principal into the future. The resulting accumulation of maturities, in already over-levered property companies, could mean that, instead of the typical 15 to 20 per cent of outstanding commercial debt being retired each year (of the approximate $3-trillion outstanding), we could find ourselves in a position where as much as 60 per cent of that debt load was coming due in the same 12- to 18-month time frame. That, too, would stress the system and potentially foster greater default rates and lower prices.
Third: Mr. Litt's perspective on the length of time that could be required to get the private real estate market back to equilibrium conditions has also been shaped by the previous downturn. Publicly traded property assets readjust relatively quickly and then have the advantage of lower leverage and access to equity capital to exploit new valuations, while private properties take years to find a new price level. He thinks a similar pattern could be repeated this time around.
"Our fundamental view is that the unprecedented real estate valuations of the 2005-2007 time period will take several years to unwind. Cheap and plentiful debt, along with rose-coloured glasses, drove the boom. It could take four to five years for the private real estate markets to find a bottom in valuations and fundamentals. Publicly traded property companies will likely be part of the solution to the dearth of capital."
Emphasizing the speed at which public property companies readjust to a new equilibrium price, Mr. Litt indicates that careful buyers can find some attractive investment opportunities in that sub-sector:
"In the early 1990s, it took six years for the direct real estate market to fall 31 per cent; however, the public property companies fell 34 per cent in less than 18 months and delivered 36 per cent and 60 per cent total returns in the following 12 and 24 months, respectively. Some investors will want to participate in the distressed sale of commercial property."
As to residential U.S. real estate, for some similar reasons, Mr. Litt believes we could see some additional falloffs in selected geographic markets of as much as 20 per cent - a number much worse than consensus - especially where markets have not already been hit by huge 40-per-cent-style drops. But he admits that the local profile of a community, and its particular pricing history, is relevant to the end game on house values. Also on the positive side, mortgage rates are low, and this can ultimately help valuations.
That said, the links among real estate, banking and consumer strength are where the problem really arises. Although the U.S. government is supporting loan renegotiations and foreclosure-prevention in general, this fund manager's concern is that these policies will only stretch out the overall financing adjustment process; putting the United States at risk of cloning Japanese-style, 1990s types of zombie banks. He is not alone in this view.
Vernon L. Smith: Professor of economics and 2002 Nobel laureate
Mr. Litt's cautionary perspective on real estate trends and the connection to the fundamental health of the consumer-driven economy finds additional support in the published thinking of 2002 Nobel laureate in economics, Vernon L. Smith, as he ruminates on the chances of a potential long-lasting recession. While not finally concluding that this is where we are heading, and readily admitting that economists can get it wrong on these issues, Mr. Smith thinks there is a material chance of an elongated structural malaise:
"We economists were wrong: Even when traders in an asset market know the value of the asset, bubbles form dependably. ... Over the past 18 months as housing prices have fallen, millions of homes became worth less than the loans on them, huge losses have been transmitted to lending institutions, investment banks, investors in mortgage-backed securities, sellers of credit default swaps, and the insurer of last resort, the U.S. Treasury. ...
"The events of the past 10 years have an eerie similarity to the period leading up to the Great Depression. ... In 1920, residential mortgage debt was 10.2 per cent of household wealth; by 1929, it was 27.2 per cent of household wealth. The causes of the Great Depression need more study, but the claims that losses on stock-market speculation and a monetary contraction caused the decline of the banking system both seem inadequate. It appears that both the Great Depression and the current crisis had their origins in excessive consumer debt - especially mortgage debt - that was transmitted into the financial sector during a sharp downturn. ... It appears that we're witnessing the second great consumer debt crash, the end of a massive consumption binge."
We've had a real estate bubble, a technology bubble, then another real estate bubble to deal with, in just the past 20 years. Some patience and balance now seems in order, lest Mr. Litt be forced to send out more "gifts" to his clients.

Full text: Potential bidders have been poring over the Montreal Canadiens' books for several weeks as part of due diligence procedures that could eventually lead to a deal to sell all or part of the storied team, sources say.
A source with knowledge of the behind-the-scenes machinations involving the Canadiens told The Globe and Mail that the process has been continuing since early March. There have been continued and strident denials from the current ownership that a decision has been made to sell the franchise, but it has emerged that would-be buyers are being asked to submit formal offers this week.
According to Radio-Canada, which cited unnamed sources in Quebec's corporate milieu, several groups have already signed confidentiality agreements with the Bank of Montreal's investment banking arm, with a view to examining the Canadiens' finances in detail.
The network reported that 10 groups, including billionaire businessmen Stephen Bronfman of Claridge Investments Inc.; Joey Saputo, son of cheese magnate Lino Saputo; and Guy Laliberté, founder of Cirque du Soleil, have signed the pacts.
Formal bids are to be tabled by 5 p.m. tomorrow and as many as 50 potential purchasers have been identified by the bank advisers, the network reported.
Majority owner George Gillett, who owns 80.1 per cent of the team, recently retained BMO to evaluate his Canadian holdings - which include the team, the Bell Centre arena, and a concert production firm - with a view to "profit maximization" strategies that could eventually involve a sale of one or more assets.
The news that Mr. Gillett had brought in the investment bankers was first reported by the Montreal newspaper La Presse on March 23; he subsequently told the Associated Press the move was about "estate planning, it has nothing to do with any decisions to sell any assets" and that persistent media reports amounted to an invasion of privacy.
Mr. Gillett couldn't be reached for comment late last night, but Canadiens vice-president Donald Beauchamp said the story is substantively similar to the La Presse revelations.
"The partnership with BMO is a confidential partnership, and we won't comment on it," said Mr. Beauchamp, who declined to confirm or deny the veracity of the latest reports.
Ronald Monet, a spokesman for BMO, said "we cannot comment on any rumours relating to the Canadiens, but can only reiterate that BMO Capital Markets has the mandate to evaluate the Canadian assets of the Gillett family so as to maximize their value."
Since the banking and financial crisis worsened last year, Mr. Gillett, an old hand at heavily leveraged business acquisitions (he also filed for bankruptcy in the early 1990s before rebuilding his business), has been beset by talk he is in financial distress.
But sources close to the Denver-based ski resort tycoon, who made his fortune in meatpacking and television stations, insist those reports are exaggerated.
Nevertheless, the Canadiens - which Fortune magazine estimates are worth $335-million (all figures U.S.), third-highest in the NHL - are an eminently sellable asset.
Though no local buyers stepped up when the team last went on the market nine years ago, there appears to be plenty of interest this time around, which is sure to delight the team's Quebecois fan base.
And given Mr. Gillett, who was initially viewed with suspicion by the Habs nation, paid a relatively modest $180-million for the team and the arena, he stands to make a substantial profit.
It could come in handy.
Mr. Gillett and Texas businessman Tom Hicks jointly own British soccer giants Liverpool FC, and are trying to refinance nearly $470-million in debt they used to purchase the team before a July deadline.
Mr. Hicks has also indicated he is looking at selling minority stakes in his sporting properties, which include the NHL's Dallas Stars and Major League Baseball's Texas Rangers.
Though former Habs great Serge Savard, now involved in a privately held commercial real estate company, said earlier this week he would be interested in buying the team if it were for sale, Radio-Canada said his name doesn't figure on the list.

Full text: Sales total $5.7-billion since start of March; global companies buy into market
CAPITAL MARKETS REPORTER
Canadian companies are selling bonds at the fastest pace in a year and the debt market is opening to a wider swath of borrowers, signalling a further thawing in the credit freeze.
Amid the worst credit market conditions in a generation, Canada's bond market is more open than perhaps any in the world. The country is not just drawing local borrowers, but global companies like Thomson Reuters PLC that could choose to tap other markets.
There have been 13 corporate bond sales totalling $5.7-billion in just five weeks since the beginning of March, including a $750-million sale by Thomson. That's a significant pickup from the sluggish pace of sales since mid-2008.
"That [market] really has exploded open in the last few weeks in Canada," said Eric Lascelles, chief economics and rates strategist at TD Securities Inc.
There is still less credit to go around because of the credit crunch, and companies facing serious trouble due to the recession will have to pay more to borrow - if they can find a lender at all. But for solid borrowers, things are looking up.
The renewed access to credit may also take pressure off the Bank of Canada, which has signalled a willingness to step in if needed and support corporate bonds by buying debt.
The change is clear in the list of sellers. Issuers are now not just companies viewed as ultrasafe, like pipelines, and financial firms that need cash no matter how rough the markets.
In addition to Thomson, cable company Shaw Communications Inc. and mall owner RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust have sold bonds.
"For a while there it was open to only a select group of issuers, and now it seems to be broadening," said Mark Chandler, a fixed-income strategist at RBC Dominion Securities Inc.
The improvement isn't confined to longer-term corporate borrowing. Some bank borrowing costs have steadied at levels not far from precrisis costs, which is feeding into a recent drop in mortgage rates.
And rates in the so-called money market, where companies borrow for weeks at a time, have stabilized.
All of which may take the pressure off Bank of Canada Governor Mark Carney.
By just suggesting that he is open to the idea of buying corporate debt - known as "quantitative easing" - Mr. Carney may encourage more companies to try borrowing via bonds, helping to reopen the market further.
"My preference would be the Bank of Canada not have to engage in quantitative easing and have it come back naturally," Mr. Lascelles said.
Canada's market is opening up earlier than some others around the globe for a number of reasons.
The country's solid banking system means there is less competition with massive government and bank bond offerings, such as those that are occurring in the U.S. to raise money for bailouts.
There's also a growing understanding on the part of investors about how companies will fare in the recession, and the outlook for the economy, while gloomy, at least doesn't seem to be getting markedly worse by the day.
For many investors, bonds seem a better bet in the current recession than stocks because in the event a company fails, bondholders usually get more back than stock holders.
On the corporate side, treasurers are now more able to get a good sense of what they will pay to borrow in the bond market.
"Before, you weren't certain what was a good price because you didn't really know where things were trading," Mr. Chandler said.
Still, companies would be wise to act while the markets are open, Mr. Lascelles said. In mid-2008, when conditions in the bond market eased, companies that didn't take advantage regretted it when markets shut down again later in the year.
Those that did "were probably thanking their lucky stars," he said.

Full text: Riding the buzz from her Hillary impression on SNL, Amy Poehler plays another presidential wannabe - this time in a TV series
Try as she might, Amy Poehler cannot contain her inner political animal.
The elfin comic actress departed Saturday Night Live during last fall's U.S. election campaign and on a particularly high-profile note: Nine months pregnant, there was Poehler, rapping and shaking her groove thing as Hillary Clinton opposite Tina Fey's dazed Sarah Palin. SNL ratings soared.
"Obviously it felt amazing to leave the show during all the election excitement," says Poehler, who gave birth to healthy son, Archie, one week following her sendoff SNL appearance. "Playing Hillary made it special."
Six months later, Obama's the man and Poehler returns to television in a lowlier government capacity on the mockumentary-style sitcom Parks and Recreation (Thursday, NBC and CITY-TV at 8:30 p.m.). In this case, she's an ambitious mid-level bureaucrat trying to climb the public-service ladder - all the way to the White House. Same big dreams, new pantsuit.
"I seem to keep playing women who want to be president," mused Poehler at the Los Angeles TV critics tour. "I don't suppose that says anything about me. But there's nothing wrong with wanting to be the best, in whatever you do, as long as you stay grounded in reality. I've always been engaged in politics, but I never wanted to be president."
Parks and Recreation puts Poehler to the Tina Fey test. Only five years ago, Fey and Poehler shared co-anchor duties on SNL 's Weekend Update desk, among other duties. Then Fey went off to the Emmy-winning 30 Rock and the weighty mantle of comedy's new It Girl.
Poehler stayed and kept adding to her catalogue of celebrity impressions - Hillary, Madonna, Ann Coulter, Michael Jackson et al. - and her sometimes frighteningly real original characters, such as Amber, the one-legged hypoglycemic trailer tart.
" SNL has its ups and downs, but it's still the best comedy training ground on television," said Poehler, the wife of Toronto-born Will Arnett of Arrested Development fame. "It was a great place to work, but the scenes and the characters are very transient. I wanted to turn the volume down a little bit and sit with a character for a while."
Poehler has been fielding sitcom offers for years but held off for the right character fit and the chance to work with the creators of the American version of The Office , who in turn were waiting to work with her.
"Amy has a very sharp comedy mind," said Parks and Recreation executive producer Greg Daniels, who holds the same rank on The Office and spent years on The Simpsons and King of the Hill . "She's particularly good playing completely deluded characters, so that's what we gave her."
In consort with fellow Office producer Michael Schur, Daniels created a complex career woman for Poehler. On Parks and Recreation , she is Leslie Knope, the female equivalent of Steve Carell's buffoonish Michael Scott on The Office .
The aptly-named Knope serves as the deputy parks director in the fictional town of Pawnee, Ind. Selfless to a fault, Leslie makes no secret of her dedication to public service, or her intent to become the first female American president, which does nothing to endear her to co-workers. Like Carell, Poehler has to make a needy and officious character endearing to viewers.
"Leslie tries so hard, but she's not very self-aware," said Poehler. "She's an optimist and really hoping the place she is now is not the place she's going to stay. Leslie wants to move up the government ladder, but she has no idea how to do it."
Her character firmly believes in the power of government to change things, and Poehler knows the type. She was born and raised in Burlington, Mass., the daughter of public-schoolteacher parents, who took an active interest in local politics. As a teenager, she campaigned for Democratic hopeful Michael Dukakis.
"We passed out a lot of leaflets," Poehler said. "My parents watched town-council meetings on TV, and they cared, obviously, about what was being built next to them. You know, are they going to put a prison where the muffin shop used to be?..."
All a truly helpful person ever wants is a big project, and for Leslie it comes in a giant hole. The pilot episode of Parks and Recreation sets up a storyline that will thread through the six-episode test run for the series.
In brief, local nurse Ann, played by Rashida Jones, on loan from The Office , conscripts Leslie into her seemingly straightforward plan to convert an unused construction pit into a community park. Next come the inevitable lawsuits, followed by greedy real-estate developers, angry neighbours, protest groups and the unfathomable city codes. Leslie joins the cause and wades happily into the mire of red tape.
Every stage of the park project introduces a new logjam, as might be expected. "The show isn't as much about politics as it is about government, if that makes any sense," said Schur. "We're not grinding any kind of axe. It's really about a small project on a very local level."
The government workplace jungle is captured video-verité, as in The Office . Leslie's efforts to push the park through are undermined by her weaselly parks-department colleague Tom (Aziz Ansari of Scrubs ), and largely ignored by her smug boss, Ron (Nick Offerman). Also in the mix is the bored college intern April (Aubrey Plaza), whom Leslie actually believes she is inspiring.
If the thudding workplace ennui on Parks and Recreation feels real, credit the input of former government lifers as consultants. "We have a few on staff, and we've visited several government offices," said Schur. "We went to Claremont, Calif., and told some people in government there the idea of the show, and they started laughing. That week they were cutting the ribbon on a park that took 18 years to build."
In most scenes, Parks and Recreation looks very much like The Office - possibly too much. Alarm bells surely went off at NBC two weeks ago with the results of L.A. test screenings of the rough-cut pilot (which immediately flew over the Internet upon release).
The controlled-viewing group labelled the pilot "predictable" and a "carbon copy" of a successful show. Poehler was deemed "too serious" and "too low-key." But Poehler doesn't seem the type to worry about advance reviews - she's already filmed all six episodes of Parks and Recreation , and has moved on to other things, including providing the voice of Gretel in the animated feature Hoodwinked 2 and tending to the needs of little Archie.
"There's really not much I can do to convince people this show isn't The Office ," she said, shrugging. "It's a good sign, however, that everybody watching will have had some contact with government inefficiency at some point in their life. If we only got those people, we'll get a huge audience."

Full text: Seems no one's told Bloor there's a recession. Amy Verner marvels at the vamped-up Mink Mile's allure to brand-name corporations, but can they still spin money in a downturn?
The only thing separating the exclusive cocktail parties hosted by Gucci and Cartier on Thursday night was Bloor Street. As the city's boldface names - Project Runway Canada judge Shawn Hewson, TV personalities Tanya Kim and Traci Melchor, clotheshorse sweetheart Stacey Kimel and coif king Jie Matar - sipped champagne at either event, or both, the message remained the same: Conspicuous consumption is a question of context.
Out came the designer bags and shoes, the ripped-from-the-runway ensembles and the jaw-dropping baubles.
Out too came the joie de vivre ; this fashion-fete face-off could not have been a more welcome counterpoint to such a cold dark winter filled with even colder, darker news.
In Toronto, Gucci and Cartier represent two among an elite group of retailers that are going big when belt-tightening has become the buzzword du jour. Gucci recently completed the redesign of its 5,085-square-foot location, providing a glamorous ribbed glass, bronze and rosewood backdrop for posh clothing and accessories while, two weeks ago, legendary jeweller Cartier settled into a two-storey shop, now 80 per cent larger than its former location. Early last month, Prada tripled in size, expanding into what was formerly Tommy Bahama next door. Cole Haan will re-open in May, introducing a luxe new look and feel.
The question is whether the city's big spenders now have pockets deep enough to spend $1,405 for stunning platform sandals from Gucci or a Cartier Trinity ring studded with diamonds that costs $4,875.
The entire neighbourhood is in the midst of a brand-name boom, in large part because new luxury condominiums are offering premium space at street level. By summer, 100 Yorkville Ave. will boast outposts of Diesel and Anthropologie (7,700 sq. ft. and 11,500 sq. ft. respectively). This marks the first location for Diesel in Toronto and the second for the popular sister brand to Urban Outfitters (Anthropologie debuts in Don Mills on April 22). The successful floral and lifestyle store Teatro Verde will be moving from Hazelton Lanes to a grand 9,000-sq.-ft. flagship that incorporates the Georgian façade of the former Mt. Sinai Hospital in May.
The evolution of the high street's status to haute did not happen overnight. Last year, Hermès, Lululemon Athletica and Lacoste all played the retail equivalent of musical chairs, moving to different spaces on Bloor Street and gussying up along the way. Harry Rosen built two new floors to create a 50,000-sq.-ft. men's-wear monolith.
Toronto-based retail consultant Graeme Spicer says that the brands are being very strategic, using location as the ultimate way to drive traffic. "There's not more than that one stretch that matters, and real estate is not easy to come by there. I think regardless of the current economic situation, [stores] will always be looking for good real estate."
Luxury brands have woken up to the potential of the Toronto market that was once only serviced by department stores. Where the former versions of Prada, Gucci and Cartier felt only slightly better than duty-free airport boutiques in Europe, the redesigned stores offer the full brand experience.
"Torontonians are mature consumers [who] are as sophisticated as anywhere," says Antony Karabus, of retail advisory firm Karabus Management, a subsidiary of PricewaterhouseCoopers Canada. "Perhaps in the past, we didn't get the same level of credit."
The Bloor Street Transformation Project, a Business Improvement Area initiative that involves widening the sidewalks and finishing them in granite, adding decorative lighting and planting London plane trees will go even further toward reinforcing an affluent, world-class image when complete (within the year, according to general manager Briar De Lange). To many, however, the timing couldn't be worse.
In most cases, such plans were in the works long before the economy tanked. But because luxury brands are mostly backed by massive corporate parents, it is likely they will weather the recession, at least for the time being. It's worth pointing out, though, that one recent study from consulting firm Bain & Company predicts a 7-per-cent decline in global luxury sales for 2009.
Certainly, the neighbourhood has not been entirely elastic, with independent boutiques suffering the most. The past few months have dimmed the lights on Noir, Hazel and Zola Shoes, all recognized for offering well-edited luxury labels. There is now an empty storefront on Avenue Road where shoe retailer Walter Steiger used to be.
"Retailers will only survive and thrive if they have a clearly differentiated reason to exist and a unique proposition that answers the question, 'Would anyone care if it goes away?' " Mr. Karabus says, referring to these types of boutiques as "me-too" stores because what they offer can be found elsewhere. "You feel bad for the people, but the market doesn't care if the me-too guy exists."
Anecdotally, though, the new elite stores appear to be benefiting from their makeovers. Midday last Tuesday, people were shopping with gusto, from a businessman dropping into Gucci for a new pair of shoes ("I've got to get back to the office," he was overheard saying) to couples doing the ring thing at Cartier.
Yet the brands remain guarded about sales figures, which makes the reality of the city's high-end retail landscape impossible to confirm.
What people speaking on behalf of the companies will say is that Toronto represents a healthy market. "Toronto has a very strong local base of customers and in a downturn they tend to be more loyal," says Daniella Vitale, president of Gucci America, in an e-mail. The redesign allows the store to better showcase the leather accessories and luggage, she adds. "This will improve the productivity."
According to Cartier's North American president and chief executive officer, Frederic De Narp, the expanded space better accommodates such robust categories as bridal, where shoppers can view pieces in intimate "salons." In a phone interview from New York, he says that he has never waited so long to find the perfect location. "There is nothing like a corner in the middle of Bloor Street."
At Prada, where customers are so regular that they are often greeted by name, more inventory - including men's wear, a larger selection of women's ready-to-wear and two walls of shelves filled with handbags - will hopefully translate to increased sales.
"The Toronto market is very smart, made of a very international clientele with a customer base that [has] really evolved in terms of fashion consumption and attention to trends in style and design," says a representative from the company from Milan. "Besides, given the worldwide crisis, Toronto is outperforming as one of the most resilient."
Over at Holt Renfrew, rather than expand, the entire third floor has become a vibrant neon-infused space that evokes 1980s artists Dan Flavin and Barbara Kruger.
"You couldn't escape the fact that the mood felt really dire," says Holt Renfrew's creative director, John Gerhardt, who conceived the space just three months ago. "I wanted to bring a sense of optimism, a sense of joy and a sense of humour."
The retailers left standing do not want to be perceived as unsympathetic. Because excessive spending and partying suddenly feel so gauche, the trend seems to be toward conscience-coddling cocktail parties. At Cartier, Fashion magazine acting managing editor Michelle Bilodeau won $5,000 to donate to a charity of her choice (the Toronto Humane Society) matched by the same amount in spending money at the boutique. Gucci plans to donate a flat contribution plus 10 per cent of all sales from Thursday through April 9 to Dignitas International, an organization that supports children living with HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. When Anthropologie holds its two opening events this season, the Nature Conservancy of Canada will benefit.
Meanwhile, entrepreneur and philanthropist Michael King gives a thumbs-up to the Gucci-Cartier collision of chic cocktail parties. "It was very clever by chance," he says. "Everyone is looking for a reason to go out and dress up but they have not wanted to appear insensitive. There's no judgment in looking pretty and wearing your jewels and your handbags when the justification is charity."

Full text: Science marches on far too quickly on the CSI shows.
Whether in Vegas, Miami or New York, the most successful franchise in TV history has reduced modern forensic science to the simplicity of a home pregnancy test. In many cases, the well-attired lab heroes make two or three astounding forensic discoveries before the first commercial break.
Not so on earth, where a guy like David Caruso would be chasing coffee for the real cops. The long, hard slog of police work is better represented in any episode of Forensic Factor (tonight, Discovery at 10 p.m.). For real cops, a murder case is not an adventure, it's a job.
"Real investigations take time," says Forensic Factor producer Sally Karan. "The storytelling on those shows requires instant gratification, but in reality most forensic experts have to wade through huge amounts of information; sometimes they send stuff to the lab and it takes three months to come back. Some cases can take years to solve."
Back for a fifth season, Forensic Factor stands out in the crime-TV genre, if only for its documentary-style approach. Whereas packaged true-crime programs such as Investigative Reports and The First 48 condense police work, the Canadian-made series exists to document the details and minutiae of a criminal case. The show has won Gemini Awards for directing and photography and airs all over the world.
Forensic Factor 's sturdy formula was established with the show's launch in 2003. Each episode in the series focuses on a true crime - more often murder most foul, or multiple murders - taken from recent history. The heinous act is brought to life through dramatic re-enactment and interviews with the cops who worked the case. In the only parallel to CSI , the viewer is kept in the dark until the final scene.
"We take the mystery approach," Karan says. "The show is a drama production, because we tell most of the story through re-enactment, but there has to be a strong science element in every story. It's very difficult finding the type of stories we need."
But the true crimes are out there. The first new show recalls a grisly case that gripped the normally quiet city of Spokane, Wash., starting in early 1997. Over a three-year period, police find the bodies of six women, each dead from gunshot wounds and dumped in the countryside. The only commonality: Each victim was a known prostitute.
Over time, the Spokane Killer strikes again and again, and adds a sick twist: One victim has a plastic shopping bag with a happy face on it over her head. Police surmise the bag was put there to stem the blood flow from the head wound.
As shown, the investigation is staggering in its scope and legwork. Several thousand tips were received and followed up by different branches of Spokane police. A red carpet fibre on one victim's shoe prompted a statewide search for a white Corvette.
Science entered the investigation in the form of vacuum metal deposition, then a new technique, which pulls a palm print off the bag.
The program interviews the Spokane forensic botanist - yes, that's a real job - who identified foreign deciduous foliage at one of the body-dumping sites; the discovery pointed police toward a suspect with an orderly garden. Also interviewed is a former prostitute who very narrowly escaped death at the hands of the killer, as shown in a chilling re-enactment.
The killings went on in Spokane for nine years and the bodies of 14 women were found. "I can tell you every one of those women were loved dearly by somebody at some point in their lives," reflects Spokane detective Fred Reutsch, now retired.
Was the killer found? Watch and learn. Then and now, the murders in Spokane generated minimal media attention - very likely because the Green River Killer murders were occurring in nearby Seattle and Tacoma around the same time. "Since the two cases were in close jurisdiction, the Green River Killer overshadowed the Spokane Killer," Karan says.
Also very unlike CSI , Forensic Factor is unlikely to run out of source material. The series makes an effort to re-enact Canadian crimes - an upcoming show chronicles a brutal murder that took place in Hamilton - but most episodes in the series are based on cases south of the border.
"To be honest, the Americans are a little more media savvy and usually more willing to talk on-camera," says Karan. "And because there are so many more people in the U.S., there are simply more murders there. Sadly there will never be a lack of stories for these kinds of shows."

Ryan's picks
FRIDAY
Spectacle: Elvis Costello with ... At long last, Elvis has entered the building. A co-production between CTV and the U.S.-based Sundance Channel, this 13-part series rides on the strength of Elvis Costello as a TV personality. The renowned artist and music historian proves a very capable host and interviewer in the first show, wherein he sits down for a chat with Sir Elton John, also an executive producer on the series. Both contemporaries and friends of long-standing, the two men are naturally at ease with each other. As in most episodes in the 13-part series, Elvis also performs with Sir Elton, which results in a stirring duet of Allen Toussaint's Working in the Coal Mine . It's a strong start to a very good idea.
CTV at 10 p.m.; Saturday, Bravo! at 8 p.m.
SATURDAY
Million Dollar Listing II
Who says there's a recession going on? This breezy reality series follows the fabulous lives of real-estate hotshots who can make more commission with one house sale than some agents will see in a lifetime. Most episodes in the series take place in Los Angeles, where even the most rundown estate can run eight figures. In one recent outing, a near-hysterical divorcee practically gave away her multimillion dollar home, just to be rid of it. But the real draw is MDL 's three agents. The most driven seller is the boyish Chad, who has put Paris Hilton and Minnie Driver into new domiciles. Tonight, he tends to a wealthy widow who demands that he find her a beach house in the most exclusive part of Malibu - right now!
It's a living.

Full text: Pension plans in Ontario are enthusiastic about using the might of the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan to manage some of their investments.
The Ontario provincial budget, tabled last Thursday, proposed that private and public sector pension plans, along with public sector institutional investors, be allowed to hire Teachers for administrative or investment services. Details are expected this week, and legislation is likely to be tabled later this year.
This move would give a boost to the already powerful Teachers plan, and give smaller plans - as well as municipalities, university endowments, school boards and Crown corporations - a chance to piggyback on Teachers' expertise.
Because of its size - $108-billion in assets at the end of 2007 - Teachers can put money into large infrastructure projects or private placements that are not available to smaller funds. And by using Teachers' services, administrative costs could be reduced and the funds would likely be subject to lower fees because of the scale of Teachers' operations.
That could be an attractive choice for some pension plans, said Derek Dobson, executive administrator of the Toronto Electrical Industry Benefit Administration Services (TEIBAS), the organization that runs the $700-million pension plan of the Toronto local of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers.
While the TEIBAS pension plan already invests through third-party money managers, the legislation would provide another option, he said. "Teachers gets access to certain deals on infrastructure or real estate that aren't available in the general marketplace. That could have positive effects for our members."
There's one other potential benefit: Teachers' goals and interests would be the same as its pension plan clients.

That rarest find: an unexplored capital

Author: Archer, Bert

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/that-rarest-find-unexplored-capital/docview/387319906/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: There's a Malmaison around the corner, part of the U.K. chain of boutique hotels that mix bordello colours with neo-gothic styling, making the whole look pleasingly like it's been put together by Russell Brand and Noel Fielding in a fit of erotic imagining. Walk outside the front door, look right, and you'll see the Sleeping Giant, the anthropomorphic top of Cave Hill said to be the inspiration for Gulliver when [Jonathan Swift] lived in the area early in his career.

Full text: Bert Archer finds Belfast has emerged from the Troubles with spirit and style
You may think you know Belfast, but you don't. This city of 645,000 is nothing less than an undiscovered European capital, with four five-star hotels (that's three more than Toronto), a Michelin-starred chef and the most opulent Victorian pub in the United Kingdom. It's where Anthony Trollope wrote his first successful novel while working at the post office; Jonathan Swift, C.S. Lewis and Seamus Heaney all found inspiration here.
So don't misunderstand recent headlines about the first political shootings here in more than a decade. There's more to Belfast than memories of violence, and this peace is not a fool's dream. This gorgeous, complicated city's natural state is more concerned with commerce than bullets and bombs. The Troubles were the anomaly, the recent shootings a thuggish blip. The miasma has lifted. Belfast really just wants to get down to business.
And business, these days, is all about hotels, restaurants, pubs and shops. There's so much here, and all of it so new, you get the impression there's some municipal overcompensation going on, as if all the Ulster businesspeople got together to make up for three decades when business here, when it was possible at all, was strictly local.
The whole city is in a tumult of improvement, using 2012 - the centenary of the sinking of the Titanic - as a goalpost.
A $750-million shopping complex, Victoria Square, opened last year, and an entirely new quarter of the city, the Titanic Quarter, with a museum, hotel, a banking centre, a college and 1,000 apartment units, will be completed within the next four years.
This Belfast bounce-back seems to be just as micro as it is macro, as much in evidence in hopeful small businesses as it is in grand municipal plans. One such business is KM Tour Guiding Services: The KM stands for Ken McElroy, a proud Ulsterman who used to supplement his schoolteacher's income by shuttling international journalists into the backrooms of Unionist and IRA strongholds to get their interviews. When that dark business dried up, he switched to tourists, taking an increasing number of British and Irish visitors past the sights outsiders had been ignoring for so long.
McElroy can be found striding around the town he's been striding around for the better part of three decades, pointing out the huge Ferris wheel next to the effulgent Victorian city hall, with its statue of proud Belfaster Lord Dufferin in front. Old linen warehouses, now lofts and shops and cafes, populate the square surrounding it, testament to its industrial revolution specialty.
Talking in his County Armagh accent, the vowels rounded and pressed right to the front of his mouth, a phonetic reminder of the region's geographical proximity to both Dublin and Glasgow, he'll tell you about Belfast's origins as a village, its explosion in the 18th century, alongside Manchester and Liverpool, into one of the industrial engines of the British empire, reaching its apogee in 1911 when its shipyards launched the Olympia and finished building its sister ship, the Titanic.
He'll still give you what he calls a "political tour," if you want, through east and west Belfast, past what's now called the Wall of Peace - where militants used to have their least bloody conflict, fought with cans of spray paint. (Giant murals, either Catholic Republican or Protestant Loyalist, can also be seen on the sides of buildings and walls in the Falls Road and Shankill Road areas, and in the Ballymurphy estate.) But McElroy prefers the pubs.
As we walk down one of the hybrid alley-streets in this increasingly pedestrianized city, McElroy points out the Duke of York, the pub where Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams worked behind the bar as a young man, soaking up the disgruntled conversation of the journalists who came from the nearby newspaper offices. One of them, the News Letter, is the oldest English language newspaper still in circulation (founded 1737). "These days," he says, remembering cheaper, darker days, "you'll pay the guts of £3" - about $5 - "for a pint." With Dublin pints sometimes tipping into the range of $12, it's still a steal.
I realize, as McElroy takes us through the dense and compact downtown core, that all I knew of Belfast before I came I'd gathered from headlines, which mostly included words like "blast," "dead" and "IRA."
But there are at least three Belfasts, laid side by side in jagged bits. You can see elements of all three from the front door of the Crown Liquor Saloon on Great Victoria Street. First, there's high Victorian Belfast, the overwrought splendour of which embraces you in this National Trust-owned gin palace, with its private snugs with a bell system to call the waiter to your otherwise unmolested box.
Directly across the street is the Europa Hotel, where the international press holed up during the Troubles. If there's a better symbol of the second Belfast, the one that tends to loom over the world's impression of the place, it's been blown up. Tall and V-shaped in its bold 1960s modern architecture, it has the distinction of being Belfast's most bombed hotel.
You can catch a murmur of the city's relationship to its recent past - the Good Friday Agreement that ended the conflict was signed 11 years ago - by talking to the Europa's concierge, Martin, who worked there back in the day. Ask him about the necktie. Usually there's one hung on a column by his desk. It's part of the Belfast bomb squad uniform, and was presented to the hotel's manager after he carried not one but two bombs out of the hotel for the squad to dispose of.
If you stick your neck out of the Crown and crane it a little to the right, next door to the Europa you'll see the five-star Fitzwilliam Hotel. It opened, with typical Ulster tongue-in-cheek, on Friday, March 13, and is a sister hotel to the five-star Fitzwilliam in Dublin. It's the latest addition to the third layer of this surprising city.
It will be hard-pressed to beat the Merchant, though. Open since 2006, this former bank headquarters offers a confident density of luxurious detail. The Merchant has 26 rooms and five suites; the bar is small but opulent. The dining room next door, with its 40-foot vaulted ceilings in what was once the main hall of the bank, is the sort that makes even those clients picked up from the airport by the hotel's own top-hat-chauffeured Bentley want to have their picture taken in it.
There's a Malmaison around the corner, part of the U.K. chain of boutique hotels that mix bordello colours with neo-gothic styling, making the whole look pleasingly like it's been put together by Russell Brand and Noel Fielding in a fit of erotic imagining. Walk outside the front door, look right, and you'll see the Sleeping Giant, the anthropomorphic top of Cave Hill said to be the inspiration for Gulliver when Swift lived in the area early in his career. If it's night, you'll hear the beats from Mynt on Dunbar Street, a huge gay bar and dance club, right next door to Milk on Tomb Street, another club that only gets going after about 1 a.m.
Popular, glam dance bars in Belfast. Go figure. But Belfast's a city that's been defined by change and tumult. The Industrial Revolution turned it from a village to a city, shipbuilding bolted it into international capital status, and the Troubles brought it low. The commercial rebirth is as big as any upheaval in Belfast's past, and to see the city in mid-surge is to see its very essence. This European capital won't stay undiscovered for long.

Full text: They may be CBC's prime-time darlings, but The Border , Being Erica and Little Mosque on the Prairie aren't escaping the cuts announced by the broadcaster this week. All three shows are being told to produce fewer episodes this season.
"When we approached television, the thing we wanted most to do is to maintain the prime-time schedule," Richard Stursberg, executive vice-president of English services, told staff yesterday. "[But] for a lot of the big shows, the real beef of prime time, we are going to have to reduce the costs for them."
But the sacrifices demanded of these jewels in the public broadcaster's television crown pale in comparison to those of radio programs The Point , Out Front , The Inside Track , In the Key of Charles and the weekend edition of The Signal , all of which will be cancelled.
CBC executives provided details of its planned cuts in meetings yesterday with staff of both English and French services. The $171-million in cuts unveiled Wednesday include 800 job losses.
Of those, more than 100 cuts will involve staff in regional radio - 68 jobs from local programs and 33 from regional network programming for a combined savings of $9.3-million. The job losses are targeted at Windsor, Ont., Thunder Bay, Sudbury, Quebec City, Moncton, Saint John, Sydney, N.S., Corner Brook, Gander and Grand Falls, Nfld.
Eighty jobs will be cut from CBC News, with investigative TV programs The Fifth Estate and Marketplace being hit. Amateur sports programming will be eliminated. Television will lose 109 jobs and about $28-million, mostly targeting programming outside of prime time, and sales and services will lose another 80 jobs.
Mr. Stursberg held a town hall meeting in Toronto yesterday, where he stressed that job cuts were not decided based on "internal equity," but on the economic realities facing the CBC's many components.
"Some of this is pretty devastating," he said. "Nobody is happy with the outcome because there is no happy outcome. What we've tried to do is do it in the least bad way possible."
But the meeting was thick with tension, as staff repeatedly attacked some of the choices.
One CBC employee from Sudbury, which is set to lose six to eight of its 16 employees, said regional staff are feeling "cut loose" a day after the CBC pledged to sustain its regional footprint. And Mr. Stursberg repeatedly came under fire from employees for the cuts to the Fifth Estate , which many staff members cited as a flagship program. Mr. Stursberg testily replied that he was against labelling one branch or program as more important than another.
Financial support will increase for the development of new multimedia platforms. "That's clearly where the growth is," Mr. Stursberg told staff.
The cuts to French services are being gradually revealed to the branch's five separate unions. Marc-Philippe Laurin, president of the CBC branch of the Canadian Media Guild, confirmed that 318 of the French arm's 336 job cuts will be shouldered by the CBC's four Quebec and Moncton unions. And 86 per cent of the cuts will be targeted at network shows, with a 14 per cent cut from regional programs.
Alex Levasseur, president of the Syndicat des communications de Radio-Canada, said the Reseau de l'information, the French-language equivalent of CBC Newsworld, is facing 84 job cuts. The regional French stations will lose 40 jobs and technical production services, 90.
He said most employees do not feel the French services are bearing an unfairly large burden when compared with their English services.
"But our people are very knocked down by the announcements," Mr. Levasseur said.
LOST SERVICES
English* Less spending on children's television programs
* Regional radio noontime programs reduced to one hour
* Reduction of music recordings by 50 per cent
* Reduction in radio drama
* Closing of one-person bureaus in La Ronge, Sask., and Thompson, Man.
* Budget reductions at CBC North
* Reduced number of one-off specials such as Canada's Next Great Prime Minister
* Dakar bureau closed, job cuts at Paris office, and Radio Canada International services in Ukrainian and Cantonese eliminated
* Toronto Blue Jays broadcasts eliminated
FRENCH
Morning radio and Saturday French-language shows out of Windsor cancelled
* Overnight network music programming from Edmonton, Vancouver and Windsor cancelled
* Regional Ottawa noontime news program cancelled
* Supper-time regional television newscasts in Quebec City, Ottawa, Moncton and Sherbrooke reduced to 30 minutes from 60 minutes, and lunchtime newscasts eliminated
* Program Zeste put "on hiatus"

Full text: Toronto Mayor David Miller lauded Ontario's big spend on infrastructure yesterday despite a lack of details and even as the province brought down changes to real estate taxes and welfare that could hit the GTA particularly hard.
Mr. Miller, who stressed the city's top infrastructure priority remains light rail transit, could barely contain his enthusiasm for the $32.5-billion earmarked by the province over the next two years, even though the budget made no mention of his "Transit City" plan.
He praised the province for making "the biggest investment I think this province has ever made in infrastructure. ... We are working closely with the province and I am confident Toronto will get its fair share of the $32.5-billion in infrastructure."
Finance Minister Dwight Duncan's uncharacteristic silence on public transit was deliberate, said officials speaking on condition of anonymity. The Ontario government did not want its big public transit projects overshadowed by the budget's tax reform message, they said, and Ontario is still in talks with Ottawa on its share of billions worth of transit projects.
Still, Toronto and other municipalities will have to wait several weeks - and then jump through some bureaucratic hoops - to tap the billions of dollars pledged for infrastructure and housing. Of the $32.5-billion announced, $5-billion is Ontario's share of the federal government's $12-billion infrastructure fund.
Municipalities would likely have to put up one-third of the cost of projects that must be started and completed by March 31, 2011, finance officials said. Cities and towns would have to prove that the projects - most likely for repair and rehabilitation of housing, roads, bridges and transit - would not have gone ahead without the short-term stimulus.
Pat Vanini, executive director of the Association of Municipalities of Ontario, said it's important for Ottawa and Queen's Park to wrap up negotiations. "We are confident all that stuff will move forward quickly," she said.
Toronto Board of Trade president Carol Wilding said the budget announcement on infrastructure and corporate tax reform is a "very powerful" combination that will create jobs now and in future.
Yet the harmonization of the GST and the provincial sales tax into a single 13-per-cent tax could be particularly painful for the real estate market in the higher-priced GTA, which has just begun to show signs of life after dramatic sales declines in recent months.
Buyers of new homes and condos worth more than $500,000 will pay a full 8 per cent more tax. The provincial portion of the tax is scaled up between $400,000 and $500,000.
For new homes under $400,000, the effective tax increase amounts to 2 per cent, but the government insists it is revenue neutral because home builders are expected to pass on savings they get from the new tax regime, which provides for tax credits on things such as building materials and other purchases.
Closing costs - including home inspection, legal fees, mortgage insurance premiums, title insurance and real estate commission - will be subject to the full 13 per cent for new and resale homes.
"We've been hit over the head yet again with more taxes," said Toronto Real Estate Board spokesman Von Palmer, noting buyers of a typical $360,000 resale property will face an additional $2,037 in taxes when the new levy comes into force July 1, 2010.
"People have to appreciate that we're still reeling from the land transfer tax that the City of Toronto brought in," he said.
Meanwhile, with the economic downturn adding to welfare case loads, Toronto and other communities will have to pay a share of a 2-per-cent rise in Ontario Works payments beginning Jan. 1, 2010.
Any increase in caseload or allowance can be especially tough on Toronto, which bears a disproportionate load of the province's welfare burden. The city constitutes 20 per cent of Ontario's population, but administers 38 per cent of its welfare cases.
Toronto and other municipalities currently pay 20 per cent of Ontario Works benefits and 50 per cent of administration, but last fall the province agreed to gradually lift welfare costs off local taxpayers by 2018.

Langley boiling over about gravel mining plan

Abstract: "I have wonderful water," said Ms. [Rebecca McDiarmid], whose home is directly across the road from where the government wants to extract one million cubic metres of gravel. "I'm concerned that I might turn on my taps one day and nothing could come out ... or that it could be contaminated, but I wouldn't know it."

Full text:   Like many others in Langley, when Rebecca McDiarmid turns on her taps and sees the clean water spilling out, she wonders how long it will last.
She is among the 3,000 to 5,000 householders in the area who rely on the Hopington Aquifer, a vast underground lake of fresh water that the municipality believes is now threatened by a proposed provincial government gravel mine.
"I have wonderful water," said Ms. McDiarmid, whose home is directly across the road from where the government wants to extract one million cubic metres of gravel. "I'm concerned that I might turn on my taps one day and nothing could come out ... or that it could be contaminated, but I wouldn't know it."
Ms. McDiarmid, a real estate agent, is also concerned about dropping property values if a massive gravel mining operation starts up in the semi-rural area, about 50 kilometres southeast of Vancouver, where many people live on one- to five-acre lots.
"There will be trucks, noise and dust," she said. "But my No. 1 concern is about the health and safety of drinking water."
Others feel the same way.
"It would be a tragic thing if it goes ahead," said Bill Mozell, who also lives near Brown Road pit, the site of the proposed mine, just south of the Trans-Canada Highway, in central Langley.
Mr. Mozell said the sand and gravel that lie over the aquifer act as a natural filter, and digging into it makes no sense. He's also worried about what pollutants might seep down into the water table when the excavated gravel is replaced with fill.
Robert Moats, an area resident who with his wife runs the Clover Valley Veterinary Hospital, said the gravel proposal has got him boiling over. "If they mine that pit they are going to kill our water supply," he fumed.
Dr. Moats said many residents are collecting water samples to establish baseline quality levels.
"The bottles are sitting on our kitchen table," he said. "We are preparing for the worst-case scenario in which we will have to fight the government [in court] for destroying our water."
Transportation Minister Kevin Falcon,whose ministry has proposed the mine, said he understands the concerns of local residents but thinks they should wait for more data.
Mr. Falcon said a series of hydrological studies are under way and he won't be making any decision until the results are in.
"I totally understand their concerns and my commitment to them, and my direction to staff, [is] that I want all the hydrological reports that we're doing [completed] and ... if there is any risk to the aquifer we won't be using the pit," he said.
Residents have expressed concerns that the government won't finish those studies until after the May 12 provincial election, but Mr. Falcon said he hopes to have results - and to make a final decision - before that date.
"Whenever the report is done and whatever it says, I'm going to share that with those folks and the decision will be made based on facts," he said.
"If it tells us that there is a risk to the aquifer, and that is a real risk, then we ain't doing it."
But that commitment gave little comfort to Langley Mayor Rick Green.
"Unfortunately that kind of assurance ... rings a little bit hollow when there is no backup plan to provide water to people in case there is a misjudgment or an error in the science," he said.
Mr. Green said if a mistake is made, thousands of people would be left without drinkable water.
"I will try everything in my power to stop it from happening," he said of the proposed mine.
Shane Simpson, NDP Opposition's critic for environment, has been raising the issue in the B.C. Legislature this week, trying to get assurances from the government that the project won't go ahead.
"It makes no sense to me," he said. "There are lots of other sources of gravel in the province ... but there is no other source of drinking water for these people.
"Unless you have another source of drinking water, it's crazy to be compromising the only source that's available," Mr. Simpson said.

Full text:   Canadiens' owner now being forced to make painful decisions in a very different economic world
If George Gillett was a really smart guy, if he was the craftiest of wheeler-dealers, adept at getting into deals and getting out, at trading assets like hockey cards - and a seer - he would have put the Montreal Canadiens on the block a year ago.
Think back.
Emotions were riding high, the team was first in the NHL's Eastern Conference and obviously playoff bound. Its mix of veteran talent and an apparently endless supply of terrific young players from the farm seemed to bode well both for the Canadiens' present and future.
The Bell Centre was sold out every night. When the hockey team wasn't in town, it wasn't just one of the busiest buildings in North America, but one of the busiest in the world, playing host to a jam-packed lineup of sports and music from both sides of the great linguistic divide. And the Habs were coming up on their centennial season, a glorious marketing opportunity, a chance to tap in to all of that equity, all of that shared history in one of the great brands in all professional sport.
Gillett had bought the club and the building for a relative song in 2000, waiting patiently while not a single local bidder stepped up. He had been met with great skepticism then - an American with no history in the sport taking control of a Canadian cultural institution - but had largely won over the fan base with his warm and humble approach, with the fact that rather than trying to impose himself on the team, the city and the province, he listened and took light footsteps.
Most important, he had hired Bob Gainey to run the show, then left him alone to do his job. Gainey seemed to have worked miracles with the team, perhaps laying the foundation for a long dreamed-of return to glory.
If Gillett had put up the for sale sign on March 25, 2008, a grateful city would have bid him fond adieu.
And Gillett, with a new soccer stadium to build in Liverpool, with a considerable debt to service from the purchase of that English Premier League team, would have been able to anticipate a nice return on his investment. Not only were the Habs peaking in value, but anyone interested in purchasing the team would have been able to take advantage of a host of friendly, motivated lenders, more than willing to finance the purchase.
Gillett didn't do it, though. Along with just about everyone else on the planet, he didn't see the crash coming. And it's also true that, of all the things in his business empire, the car dealerships and ski resorts and food processors and NASCAR team, he liked being the owner of the Montreal Canadiens very much indeed. It was fun, it was rewarding, and - as a happy byproduct - it was profitable.
Which leaves open only one interpretation of the events of the past week, when it was revealed by La Presse that Gillett had retained bankers to take a hard look at all aspects of his family business: He got caught holding, like a whole lot of other people, and now is being forced to make some painful decisions in a very different world.
"There's no point in hiding it, we're going through a very difficult economic period," Canadiens president Pierre Boivin told the newspaper. "Banks are reticent to finance even very good projects. You see it in real estate. These advisers will ensure the maximization of the business assets and readjust the Gillett family's financial strategies as needed. ... It could entail refinancing, it could entail bringing in new investors, or purely and simply the sale of certain assets."
The sale of any asset, but especially the asset that is the Montreal Canadiens, will be far trickier now, though the business of the franchise is still booming.
Never mind the Habs' struggles on ice. Financing is extremely hard to come by. There's no light yet at the end of the recession tunnel. All of the seats in the Bell Centre are still full, but no one's betting the house on the immediate future of anything based on discretionary spending. The NHL, which had significant issues even in much better times, faces enormous challenges trying to keep all of its 30 franchises afloat.
No arguing that from the fans' point of view - in the midst of all the turmoil surrounding the team as it slides in the standings, in the midst of the great anniversary - the timing is terrible.
But the truth is, from the owner's point of view - the very good owner's point of view - the timing is even worse.

Full text:   Top-secret work on centrifuges was transformed after the war into life-saving cardiovascular research
As an aerospace medical researcher, Earl Wood spanned the era from fighter pilots to astronauts.
The version of the G-suit that he helped develop for bomber pilots flying at high altitudes and fighter pilots who were blacking out in dogfights with the Japanese during the Second World War, made a successful transition to peacetime. In a modified and advanced form, these pressurized suits were used by the test pilots who broke the sound barrier and the astronauts who circled the globe and landed on the moon.
"As both a physician and researcher, Dr. Wood provided nearly five decades of outstanding leadership to Mayo Clinic and scientific advancements to the world," Denis Cortese, Mayo Clinic president and CEO, said in a news release. The author of more than 700 scholarly articles and several book chapters, Dr. Wood's research was also instrumental in modifying an air pressure gauge from an aircraft into the standard tool for measuring arterial blood pressure; developing the first diagnostic cardiac catheterization in humans; refining the heart-lung bypass machine to enable Mayo to perform open-heart surgery as a routine procedure; formulating indo-cyanine green dye to measure heart pump function in diagnosing congenital heart disease; and creating advanced X-ray imagery of the heart, lungs and circulation leading to an X-ray-based computed tomography machine that evolved into CT scanner technology.
Well into extreme old age, Dr. Wood continued to work and consult with colleagues around the world. "He was a giant as a person," said Jan Stepanek, a Swiss internist who is now medical director of the Mayo Clinic in Arizona. Dr. Stepanek credits Dr. Wood with sparking his own interest in researching aerospace medicine. "Many things are called mentorship today, but one key ingredient is a dedicated presence when people have time together," he said. "When you were sitting with Dr. Wood, nothing else mattered. He was there with you and for you and he was going to give you the most in-depth answers to your questions that you could ever hope for."
Born in the American Midwest before the First World War, Earl Wood was the second youngest of six children of William G. Wood and his wife Inez. Both his parents were teachers, despite their lack of secondary education, and his father also worked as a farmer and a real estate salesman. After attending local schools, he attended Macalester College, a liberal arts institution in St. Paul, Minn., graduating in 1934. Two years later, on Dec. 20, 1936, he married Ada Peterson, his college sweetheart. Together they raised four children.
"He was there for the individual, as an advocate for his graduate fellows, his students, his technicians and his family," said his youngest son Andrew (Andy) Wood, a wellness facility entrepreneur. "He was the ultimate in a leader because he emphasized people's strengths and leveraged those strengths," said Mr. Wood, explaining how his father took time to help him, "a severe dyslexic," learn to read and do math problems. "He basically got me through high school and into college and eventually graduate school. He was never critical, but he would come up with a plan and pose it in such a way that it seemed like it was my idea so I took ownership of it."
Dr. Wood earned postgraduate degrees, including a PhD and an MD at the University of Minnesota and a National Research Fellowship at the University of Pennsylvania, before being hired to teach pharmacology at Harvard University. That is where he met Charles Code, the Canadian-born physiologist who had set up an Aero Medical Unit in the late 1930s at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., researching the deleterious effects of high acceleration on pilots of civilian and military aircraft.
A few months after the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, Dr. Code hired Dr. Wood to help solve a deadly problem affecting American pilots. Some of them were blacking out because blood was rushing from their heads and pooling in their legs as they climbed and swooped in bombing runs and dogfights with the enemy. Dr. Wood and other members of Dr. Code's research team turned themselves into human guinea pigs by building a human centrifuge in the lab.
The researchers took their experiments aloft in an Army A-24 plane, a Dauntless dive-bomber they called the G-Whiz, which made dives and loops over the Minnesota cornfields. These experiments in gravitational pull led them to develop a G-suit, with pouches or bladders around the legs that the wearer could pump full of air, thus blocking an excessive downward flow of blood and obviating the tendency for pilots to lose consciousness from a lack of blood in the brain.
This top-secret work on centrifuges was transformed after the war into internationally recognized cardiovascular research that extended to heart, lung and blood physiology and cardiac catheterization.
"Dr. Wood was absolutely instrumental in the development of cardiopulmonary bypass, a technology that saves hundreds of thousands of lives every year," Thoralf Sundt III, a Mayo Clinic surgeon, said in a statement.
Dr. Wood's academic career proceeded apace with his medical research. He became a professor in the Mayo Graduate School of Medicine in 1951. Seven years later, the U.S. Air Force and NASA asked Dr. Wood to continue his G-forces research with the result that he and his team began testing prototypes of the Project Mercury astronaut couches on the Mayo centrifuge.
By the early 1960s, Dr. Wood, who was head of Mayo Clinic's Cardiovascular Laboratory, was hosting research fellows, visiting scientists and clinicians who came to study in his lab and learn new techniques.
Even though he retired from the Mayo Clinic at age 70 in January, 1982, Dr. Wood continued to correspond and consult with researchers and colleagues from around the world. One of them was Dr. Stepanek, who, in the late 1990s, was investigating the differences between air- and water-pressured G-suits. The two men, one in his mid-80s and the other in his early 30s, began an e-mail and fax conversation. "It was probably the time in my life when I looked the smartest," said Dr. Stepanek, who would send questions in the late afternoon from Switzerland and stand by the fax machine the next morning to receive reams of technical reports and documents dating back to the Second World War from Rochester.
"He was sharp as a tack," Dr. Stepanek said. "I would never have gotten some of the ideas and some of the thought processes without the interaction with him."
Two years later, the two men met in Rochester. "He had grey hair and a sparkle in his eyes, he was minimally hunched over and slightly hard of hearing, but he was an extremely attentive listener," said Dr. Stepanek. "In everybody's career and life there are these moments when you have the opportunity to spend time with somebody who is not just talented and a scientifically brilliant person, but somebody who manages to influence your life," he said. "He was brilliant, humble and a gentleman. What a wonderful human being."
Earl Wood
Earl Wood was born on Jan. 1, 1912, in Mankato, Minn. He died March 18, 2009, in Rochester, Minn., of pneumonia following surgery for a broken hip. Predeceased by his wife Ada in 2000, Dr. Wood, who was 97, leaves four children and four grandchildren.

Full text:   While new projects are being shelved, sales of existing properties could see a rise as investors look for deals
The once stately pace of new hotel construction in Canada has hit a recessionary speed bump.
The challenges of finding financing during a global credit crunch, along with uncertainties about short-term demand from both business and recreational travellers, has meant that almost all new projects in the planning stages, and even those in the early stages of construction, have or will be shelved to wait for better days, experts say.
At the same time, however, those same hurdles may mean a brisk upswing in the sale of existing properties, as private investors take advantage of opportunities for recession-fuelled deals.
"We expect private investors to make up about 75 per cent of the resale market in hotel properties this year," says Bill Stone, executive managing director at Colliers International Hotels, the hospitality division of Colliers International, a real estate advisory company.
"In down times especially, private investors have the cash, can qualify for financing and can see great opportunities for superior returns."
Those internal rates of return on hotels usually run at about 20 per cent, he says. And with lenders raising both minimum standards for financing and interest rates charged, properties looking to refinance debt or in need of cash for repositioning or refurbishing may indeed come on the market this year.
"Over all, we are not worried right now," says David Larone, director of PKF Consulting Inc., which tracks the hotel industry.
"The situation is not like the meltdown of the early nineties, when we had 30-per-cent oversupply in many urban centres. Projects which are above grade in the construction cycle are likely to go ahead, especially smaller 80- to 120-room business hotels, which have represented the bulk of activity in the past two years," he says. Canada had 360,000 hotel rooms in properties with 25 rooms or more at the end of 2008.
"We have been adding to the number of rooms at between 1.7 per cent and 2 per cent for the past few years. We think this year that increase will fall marginally to 1.5 per cent," Mr. Larone adds.
And after that? "We will just have to see what the spring and summer bring," he says. "Whatever predictions you make now will likely prove wrong. We just don't know what is going to happen."
For the past three years, the focus in the hotel industry has been on smaller, business-oriented hotels in suburban and smaller city markets, says Curtis Gallagher, vice-president at CBRE Hotels, a division of CB Richard Ellis Real Estate Ltd. They were targeted at meeting the needs of an expanding economy, were relatively inexpensive to build - $125,000 to $150,000 a room versus triple that cost in urban centres - and could be up and running within a year.
With such a short turnaround cycle from start of construction to completion, developers of those new properties have to take out their pencils to work out cost versus rewards.
Is it better to finish a project that will open its doors while the recession is in full swing, or save money by halting work and waiting for better economic times to complete construction?
At the same time, the ability to find financing for new projects or even complete construction has become moot in smaller centres, Mr. Gallagher says.
"What we are seeing is that any project that is not above grade [ground] level in the construction cycle is being postponed," Mr. Gallagher says.
In the first quarter of last year, there were 265 projects totalling 30,000 rooms in the planning or construction stage across Canada, according to CBRE Hotels. By comparison, by January of this year, those figures had dropped to 237 projects and 29,000 rooms.
"About 25 per cent of those 237 were under way, 35 per cent were scheduled to start in the next 12 months and about 30 per cent were in the planning stage," he says. "I would guess that unless they are 60 per cent to 70 per cent complete, projects will be shelved until conditions improve."
At the same time, large new luxury hotels already under way will undoubtedly be completed, he adds. In Toronto, mixed-use projects such as the Four Seasons, Ritz-Carlton, Shangri la and Trump Tower will continue apace. The condominium element of those projects has reached the stage in the sale cycle to justify construction financing.
The only major hotel project cancelled to date is Vancouver's Ritz-Carlton. In that city, the new condo market has taken a nosedive in both buyer demand and market prices.
"We feel construction will not start again until the credit crunch and recession ease," Mr. Gallagher says. "And, right now, nobody knows when that will be."
Despite concerns about the effects the current recession will have on business travel - the life blood for many hotels across the country - vacancy rates in January and February are down only marginally from the same months last year, according to PKF Consulting.
"The effects of cutbacks may not have hit yet," Mr. Larone says. If the recession deepens, the situation may change because travel budgets are often one of the easiest overhead items to slash.
Nor have hotel operators reduced rates.
"Cutting rates in today's market is unlikely to attract more business and, besides, once you cut rates, it is awfully hard to raise them again," Mr. Larone says.
One bright spot in an uncertain future noted by both Mr. Larone and Mr. Stone is increasing interest by U.S. and European equity funds in financing both new and resale hotels.
"There are equity groups now looking to finance deals," Mr. Larone says. They are attracted by the fact that, unlike the early nineties, most hotel operations have strong balance sheets and cash on hand - plus the lure of those 20-per-cent returns on investment.
Local credit unions are also playing a role in financing business hotels in smaller centres, Mr. Stone adds. "They see it as a way of supporting the local economy."

Full text:   Small companies often underestimate cost of doing business south of the border, or don't prepare for labour, tax and legal issues
The subprime mortgage crisis in the United States may have helped push that country into a recession, but for one Calgary company the financial fiasco represented a cross-border opportunity.
CBI Group, a real estate investment firm, has launched a fund that aims to raise up to $12.5-million to buy about 175 single-family homes in Phoenix over the next year. The idea is that Canadians will be able to invest in the United States, profiting from the housing market collapse.
"The opportunities are limitless for CBI," said Jarrett Zielinski, CBI's vice-president of property acquisitions. "For Canadians with a good cash flow, real estate has become so distressed the opportunities are boundless."
CBI, with a staff of 15, is the investment arm of Red Deer-based Diamond Key Homes, which has 40 employees. CBI's principals have invested in rental companies in the Arizona market since the 1980s, but their Arizona Acquisition Fund is their first attempt to raise public money.
For a minimum of $10,000, investors in the house-buying fund will receive a 6-per-cent bond interest that will be disbursed as the flow of cash permits. They will also share in 60 per cent of the net profits when the Phoenix houses are sold. CBI will keep the other 40 per cent as profit.
The houses CBI is buying used to sell for about $300,000 (U.S.). Most of the 1,800-square-foot homes are now valued at around $150,000, but CBI has so far grabbed 20 houses for $90,000 each in the depressed market. The company hopes the homes will be worth $175,000 to $200,000 when it comes time to sell them in a few years.
The owners of the Phoenix houses can remain in their homes as tenants, paying rent to a local property manager retained by CBI. The company aims to sell the houses in about five years to pay out the fund, and will give the tenants first crack at purchasing their homes.
"What's good for us is, affordability has returned to the Phoenix market," Mr. Zielinski says. "It's something we believe over time will correct itself on an upward direction."
CBI's foray into the U.S. market is just one example of how small Canadian companies are doing business south of the border, even in the tough economic times. According to a recent HSBC Bank Canada survey, the company is not alone in its desire to access the enormous U.S. market.
The survey of 250 small- and medium-sized business owners across Canada, whose firms generated between $1-million and $20-million in annual revenues, found that 45 per cent had already expanded into foreign markets, including the United States. Another 8 per cent planned to do so.
In many ways the United States is the easiest foreign market for Canadian businesses to jump into because of proximity, the scale of the market and similarities in culture, notes Shahir Guindi, a Montreal-based partner with the law firm of Osler Hoskin & Harcourt LLP.
But Canadian entrepreneurs who want to move into the U.S. market should proceed cautiously, Mr. Guindi said: "Do it with your eyes wide open." He warns that businesses need to be aware of and negotiate a tangle of different legal, tax and employee relation systems.
The biggest hurdle for small companies is they often underestimate the cost of doing business in the United States, Mr. Guindi says. While the labour costs are often cheaper and commercial real estate may be inexpensive, cross-border tax issues, legal and licensing requirements can all drive up the price of doing business in the United States.
Mr. Guindi says the additional cost burden doesn't prevent companies from crossing the border, but "it certainly adds layers of compliance and complexity that they hadn't initially anticipated."
Beth Wilson, Canadian managing partner with KMPG Enterprise, agrees that the U.S. market is significant because of its sheer size. But companies need to understand precisely why they're entering that market, she said.
"It's really important to understand strategically why you're wanting to go into the U.S., because that then drives a decision about whether you need a location in the U.S. or whether it's something you can operate from Canada," Ms. Wilson said.
"You don't necessarily need to go and invest in operations and people in the U.S. because your customers are there."
She warns small businesses to watch for hidden costs, such as health care, which can form a large portion of U.S. labour costs. And she cautions that accessing credit can be very difficult.
"If you're looking to borrow in the U.S., it's an even more serious environment than the one we face in Canada."
Jon Hountalas, HSBC Bank Canada's executive vice-president of commercial banking, notes that 20 years ago it was unusual to find small businesses selling to the U.S. market. Today, it's the norm, he said, but it is best to enter the market carefully.
"If you try to go in too fast, too hard, I think you could hurt your business. It's a different business environment down there and you have to learn to adjust to it slowly," Mr. Hountalas said.
Back in Calgary, Mr. Zielinski said small businesses need to understand the risks they're taking when they venture south.
For example, he thinks Canadian exports of high-end luxury goods in the United States might not do well in the current economic climate because consumer demand has dropped off.
"We're investing in housing," Mr. Zielinski said. "Housing is a vital part of our society and it's something people will always need."

Tips for U.S. work
* Select your location carefully . Don't assume every American state is the same. Taxes vary, as do economic incentives offered by each state to establish operations and hire locally.
* Protect your corporate assets. Set up a layer of U.S. corporate holdings and have U.S. companies do your marketing and sales to offer a level of protection against potentially litigious consumers.
* Hire local staff. Sales and marketing professionals often bring with them a deep network of contacts. "To arrive cold as a Canadian in a new market and say, 'Here, buy my stuff,' is a lot more challenging," said Shahir Guindi, a Montreal-based partner with law firm Osler Hoskin & Harcourt LLP.
* Be aware of higher costs. Insurance is often more expensive in the United States, for example, because of the country's more litigious environment.
* Move staff across the border in good time . And make sure workers meet all U.S. visa and entry requirements.

THE RISE AND FALL

Author: Freeze, Colin

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/rise-fall/docview/387316967/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: You can't blame the locals for feeling antsy. Half the city's homes are worth less than what's owed on them. Fortune magazine reports that Vegas has edged Detroit as America's most abandoned city. So stick to the tourist traps, because the planned opulence doesn't extend very far from the Strip.

Full text:   When economies crumble, gambling is the last thing on most people's minds. But if you have coin to spare, now may be the best time to roll the dice on Vegas. Colin Freeze visits an empire in decline
Maybe the Roman statues inside Caesars Palace seeped into my subconscious. Maybe I just played cards too long. Either way, I
left Las Vegas convinced I had
won a remarkable insight into human history.
Gambling speeds the decline of empire. Nothing is clearer. This came to me like an epiphany after I busted out of an all-night poker game a few weeks back. Leaving the cards and green felt behind, and walking past some square-jawed marble centurions in the nearly empty casino, I remembered something from Catholic school. When Christ was crucified, Roman guards - not unlike the effigies I was seeing - cast lots for his coat. Confronted with one of history's great tipping points, an empire-ending event right in front of their noses, they
ignored it. They put their heads down - and rolled the dice.
There's something telling in that. Gambling is simple, seductively short-term. Empires are complex, and play out over decades, centuries even. Still, there's a nexus, and if you've got an imagination, gambling through Vegas today can be like walking through history. On the skyline, pyramids bump up into Parthenons; the Eiffel Tower looms over the Statue of Liberty. Casino-
resorts erected these gaudy simulacrums to draw visitors to the Las Vegas Strip, four miles of the world's most concentrated gambling action.
Now, however, the financial crisis is sucking the life out of the city, and it's like all these empires are dying all over again.
Everyone knows how America's great economic epicentres are suffering, after rampant real-estate speculation - society-sanctioned gambling, really - spawned a global financial meltdown. But forget Detroit. Leave aside Wall Street. Spare a thought for Sin City.
"What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas," the slogan goes. These days, what's happening is grim: Gaming revenues are down. Casino stocks and real-estate have plummeted too. Potential tourists are far more preoccupied with figuring out how to pay their mortgages than with heading to Vegas to arrange trysts.
The upside is that in this crisis lies opportunity. Supposing you still have any income left to dispose of, there's never been a better time to go: Vegas might be at its most affordable ever .
Trust me - I'm a compulsive gambler. I know. The flight was cheap, the hotel rooms cheaper. The casinos, competing for ever-scarcer dollars, were offering all kinds of deals. I hit just about every one.
The airport arrival area, though, almost fooled me. There was a half-hour lineup for a taxi, so at first it seemed like times were still flush. But LAS's development has always lagged behind the casino-
resorts, which really tell the tale of the city's fortunes.
A couple of miles from the airport and up the Strip, the lower- to middle-end resorts are renting out rooms at flophouse prices: $25 to $55 for a weeknight. Don't be put off by this - sleeping at, say, a Bally's or the Stratosphere is akin to what you might find in a Quality Inn.
The rates are so low because the hotels bet they'll make their money back on their casino floors and restaurants, and when they jack up the prices on the weekend. They give out coupon books meant to induce guests not to stray. But nothing, of course, precludes you from leaving cheap lodgings to see the swankier places up the Strip.
It's inside the litter of newborn casino-resorts, the still-$200-a-night places, that you find garish opulence and witness the bloom coming off the rose. Before hitting the casino floors, you're greeted by rows of empty Prada, Gucci and Louis Vuitton stores - and window shoppers too intimidated to venture in.
"Where are all the high rollers?" you begin to wonder.
Questions like this can shatter Vegas's bluff. The illusion of conspicuous consumption is essential to the enterprise. Without it, the whole city starts to look as suspect as the sequined decolletage of certain cocktail waitresses. Sure, it's appealing at first - then it just seems freakish, as it dawns on you that behind the glitz and sparkles, everything's been built up way bigger than
what the natural order would support.
A security guard at the Bellagio brought this home for me. When I stopped to ask him some questions, he ended up giving me a half-hour rundown on the billion-dollar casino-
resort. It wasn't like he had much else to do.
Long story short, he said the Bellagio used to be packed all the time, to the point where three other guards were watching the same stretch of hallway. Now, he works it by himself.
But don't cry for the Bellagio. Of all the casinos, it should do fine. Outside, its dancing fountains astound. Inside, its poker room bustles, with card sharks lining up to play games you have never heard of.
I'm a Texas Hold 'Em specialist, so when I heard mention of "Badugi" at the Bellagio, I figured someone ordered a Korean entree. The big-money players the next table over set me straight: It's a low-card poker variant - and don't even think about sitting down with less than $10,000. Looking at the couple of hundred dollars I had stacked in front of me, I decided to stay far away.
The Bellagio is friendly to all gamblers, but it still draws the dwindling ranks of the high rollers. Some canny investments it has made over the years have helped. Take the multimillion-dollar stage it built for Cirque du Soleil's O . Seven dozen of the world's best contortionists, synchronized swimmers and acrobats do amazing things on a platform that's sometimes solid, sometimes water. Even at $300 for a pair of tickets, you leave feeling you got the better end of the bargain.
But here's the rub. More than a half-dozen Cirque shows and even a couple of knockoffs are playing at casinos around town, some to mixed reviews. They've proven such a draw that Cirque's founder, the Quebec-born street performer (and now billionaire poker player) Guy Laliberté, is credited with almost single-handedly revitalizing Vegas over the past 20 years. But now that the concept is more of a Vegas fixture than sequin shows and foul-mouthed comedians, you have to wonder about its shelf life.
That there are so many shows in the same vein here is telling. Vegas impresarios double down on their bets as casually as the punters playing $3 blackjack at old-school casinos such as Circus Circus. It's a strategy that works out great when you're on a run - but you can easily lose your whole stack when your luck ends.
Consider Steve Wynn, the casino magnate who built the Bellagio, had a falling out with the owners and then tried to one-up it. His glamorous (if immodest) namesake resort - Wynn - was built for a couple of billion and opened in 2005. It's onyx-black outside and gorgeous, bright red everything inside. Don't miss it. It is tastefully grand.
But Mr. Wynn was so enamoured of his project that last year he opened a carbon copy casino next door. It's called Encore and it seems so superfluous that maybe it should have been called the Deja Vu.
It's not bad for the tourists: You can play table games for $10 a hand at the Encore, compared to the identical tables that start at $50 at the Wynn. But after a couple of hours of cards at the Encore, I left wondering if my $5 in losses were really going to help Mr. Wynn pay for his sparkling new
resorts.
The tough times mean that investors, once bullish on Vegas's future, now bet on bleak. A share of most of any of the major casino corporations would have cost you close to a black chip - $100 - a couple of years ago. Now the same companies trade for a handful of white $1 chips. And yet somehow, as stocks head down, the Strip's skyline keeps going up. Crane operators, fuelled by inertia, slowly work away at new high-rises and luxury condos - even though many buyers, including Hollywood celebrities, are running away from their real-estate investments.
Developers put on a brave face. MGM Mirage, one of the suffering casino corporations, has just announced it's taking reservations for new luxury suites to open this fall - with rates to range from $150 to $2,000 a night.
That'll be good money if MGM can get it. Then, again, the company has also just announced a construction flaw is leading it to cut another planned tower in half. Effectively, MGM lopped 49 storeys into 28 faster than one of its peevish Pai Gow dealers cut down my chip stack - but this could be a blessing in disguise for MGM, since luxury condos aren't moving anyway.
The overbuilding of Vegas is worrisome for the aging casinos. Employee anxiety is palpable in some. One blackjack dealer at a 1950s-era resort - once home to the Rat Pack, now home to a $7 buffet - kept pausing to ask me how business was in the other places I had been hitting. You know, just in case she ended up needing a new job somewhere else.
You can't blame the locals for feeling antsy. Half the city's homes are worth less than what's owed on them. Fortune magazine reports that Vegas has edged Detroit as America's most abandoned city. So stick to the tourist traps, because the planned opulence doesn't extend very far from the Strip. If the casinos get to be too much, you can consider spending $200 to $300 and a full day on a bus trip to the Grand Canyon and the Hoover Dam, or blow $500 for a chopper ride if you're feeling flush.
But for me, there's nothing on Earth more grand than peeling the corners of cards off of green felt, and peeking at pocket aces that nobody else at the Hold 'Em table knows you have. And I find the best poker rooms are still downtown, not far from the strip, a $10 cab ride - or $3 on the bus known as "The Deuce." The appeal of the so-called "Fremont Street Experience" is really in what's been subtracted from the strip. There are no mini-Romes, mini-Parises, or mini-New Yorks in sight.
Instead you get 1950s-era casinos where the action really started, places that never aspired to be anything more than the garish and slightly seedy casinos that they are. This is vintage Vegas at its best - cards, coins and cash.
The Golden Nugget hosts the most relaxed poker room in town, putting the fun back into a game that too many players regard as a profession. Stick around long enough and you might see a real Vegas character, "The Duke." The rake-thin card player daily puts on his cowboy hat, heads downtown, and plops $10,000 cash onto tables where everyone else has bought in for $200.
And then, he never bets a hand. No one knows why.
Across the street, Binion's is where they used to hold the World Series of Poker. It's seen better days, but I'll always have a soft spot for it: It's where I beat 120 poker rivals in a tournament to claim $2,500. The money was great. But it was a real bonus to win in a place where the greats elevated cards into an art form.
Pictures of the legends at their peak are mounted on the walls. Some are of Doyle Brunson, a 10-time world champion from Texas, still going strong today in his 70s. More cautionary are the portraits of Stu Unger, a pipsqueak of a cocaine fiend from New York, who became a three-time world champion before he was found
dead in a Vegas flophouse in his early 40s.
So many gamblers have come to Vegas to make their fortune. So many others have lost a lot more than money. The city has manufactured countless legends, and makes more every day.
There may be some longevity to this enterprise. After all, it has been more than a half-
century since colossal casinos started popping up like incandescent weeds in the desert, decades since gangsters headed west to build the first gambling halls, placing huge bets on their ability to capitalize on a simple idea.
Given human nature, servicing greed will always be a growth industry. As empires rise and fall, you can bet there's something permanent in that instinct.

Full text:   Amid the struggles of the U.S. newspaper industry and a real estate meltdown that has hit California particularly hard, David Black still believes an ailing San Diego daily has value.
Mr. Black, who controls about 150 mostly small newspapers in Canada and the United States, and Los Angeles-based Platinum Equity agreed to acquire the San Diego Union-Tribune yesterday for an undisclosed price. This, just one day after the venerable Seattle Post-Intelligencer farther up the West Coast published its last edition on paper.
The deal vaults Victoria-based Mr. Black from the community-newspaper league in Western Canada where he has made his name and into the higher-stakes business of U.S. newspaper publishing as many big names are retrenching.
Despite swiftly shrinking advertising revenues and heavy debt loads that are impaling many newspapers, the business still has fundamental strengths, Mr. Black said yesterday after the deal was announced. Many newspapers still have solid readership, between papers and their websites, and an improving position in local markets compared with radio and TV stations, he said.
The trick is getting from here - a deep recession - to there, recovering some ground in classifieds, and adding more local retail advertisers to papers.
"I believe in newspapers, and so does Platinum," Mr. Black said yesterday afternoon in an interview. "There's a lot of advertisers out there that we're not calling on and we have to figure out how to get them in to the newspapers."
Mr. Black's privately held Black Press Ltd. of Victoria is about 20 per cent owned by Toronto Star owner Torstar Corp. In a blaring and brutal sign of the newspaper times, Torstar values its Black Press stake, which it bought in 2002 for $20 million, at zero.
Many of Black Press's titles are small, mostly located in Western Canada and many published weekly. Black Press also owns some U.S. papers, led by its largest holdings, the Honolulu Star-Bulletin and the Beacon Journal in Akron, Ohio.
Several months ago, Black Press bumped up against private equity player Platinum Equity bidding for unnamed properties. They discovered they had entwined interests and complementary skills: Mr. Black knew the business, and Platinum had a lot of money - its funds have attracted more than $3-billion in funds.
So Mr. Black, individually, teamed up with Platinum, and they won the Union-Tribune, whose roots date to the 1860s.
Mr. Black serves as a director and adviser for Platinum, a firm that says its expertise is in "businesses facing complex operational challenges in declining or transitioning markets." Mr. Black, working with a firm with stakes in, among other things, fibreglass, North American Hispanic telecommunications, and construction crane rentals, will be the newspaper man.
Newspapers face the greatest crisis in the history of the business. Every paper is hurting. Denver's Rocky Mountain News, among others, is freshly dead. Once-unassailable titles such as the San Francisco Examiner teeter.
"This is what I've done for a long time now in my life, so I have a pretty good feel for it," Mr. Black said. "I don't have to go to a mountain top and reflect for months to figure out some of the basics in our business. It can't be grey. It has to be colourful, local, entertaining, topical and witty."
It won't be easy. Further cuts, Mr. Black suggested, are likely.
But it will come back, he is certain. Newspapers such as the Union-Tribune have the intangible and valuable asset of solid trust and local acumen. Newspapers, through this decade, rode the economic, real-estate-fuelled bubble, greatly bolstered advertising and especially lucrative classifieds, which have all crashed, a fall made infinitely worse by unserviceable debt loads.
Never mind Craigslist.
Gaining some of it back, and expanding a presence with local advertisers, makes it add up, Mr. Black said, especially in places like San Diego.
He wouldn't talk about potential plans in Canada or the possibility that about properties owned by the heavily-indebted CanWest Global Communications Corp. could emerge for sale.
In San Diego, at least, the sun will shine tomorrow.
"Well, other than the fact it's one of the nicest cites in North America, it's a great market," Mr. Black said. "It's a market you know is going to keep growing."

Full text:   Sheep dot green hills. Quaint cottages sit next to a tiny stone church. Neighbours who've known each other since birth greet strangers warmly. And for about $32-million (U.S.), this slice of England could be yours.
The village of Linkenholt's 21 cottages, grand manor house and lush green cricket pitch are part of an estate that includes 1,500 acres of farmland and 425 acres of woods.
The entire estate is for sale - as a whole - with the only part excluded being St. Peter's, built on the site of a 12th century church. "That," said real estate agent Tim Sherston, "is owned by God."
The 40 residents, many of whom have lived here all their lives, hope any new owner will keep the estate together and resist the urge to parcel off the land in Hampshire, 120 kilometres southwest of London.
"The Garden of Eden, this is," said 84-year-old Alan Smith, who moved to the village in 1948 to work on the estate's farm and stayed.
His wife, Betty, was born in Linkenholt. They married after meeting at a local dance.
It's not the first time the estate has gone up for sale. It was bought for £2,000 ($3,558) in 1629 and sold about 60 years later for £12,000.
The estate remained in the same hands until the 19th century, and Roland Dudley bought it in the 1920s. In the 1960s, Herbert Blagrave took ownership - and after he died without heirs, his charitable trust became the owner.
Mr. Sherston said the trust is trying to diversify its interests, which is why it has chosen to sell. He said Linkenholt could be a unique purchase: "There isn't really anything like this on the market."

Full text:   The Regent Bal Harbour
10295 Collins Ave., Bal Harbour Village, Fla.; 305-455-5400; www.regentbalharbour.com.
ROOMS AND RATES
61 rooms from $603; 63 suites from $1,049.
This winter has not been a good time to open a luxury hotel - especially in Miami, where the recent real estate boom created a flood of new rooms and condos. Even now that the party's over, a string of new lodgings will be opening there well into 2009.
It's safe to say, though, that few will match the Regent Bal Harbour for ambition. It's not that the place is huge (it has only 124 rooms, all of which have been sold to private owners and are booked by guests when not in use). It's that it is designed to deliver Asian-style five-star service, a big stretch for laid-back South Florida. The facilities are elaborate, appropriate to a condo-hotel where prices originally started at $1.6-million. How many hotels do you know that have a multimillion-dollar art collection? The rooms aren't bad,
either.
LOCATION On the northern tip of Miami Beach, Bal Harbour is technically a separate village of its own. And while nearby beach towns on the "Gold Coast" are going upscale, Bal Harbour has been there for decades. It's an enclave of very pleasant second homes and well-maintained condos. Feel like going shopping? Your
only option is the nearby Bal Harbour Shops, one of the most exclusive malls in the United States.
The Regent occupies a site on the very end of the village, alongside a waterway and opposite a public park. The northeastern and eastern views over the ocean are wide open; on the other side is low-slung Bal Harbour, then the Intracoastal Waterway and Miami's skyline in the distance. South Beach, the area's real heart, is about 15 kilometres away.
AMBIENCE It's so sedate, South Beach feels 100 kilometres away. The hotel is isolated from its neighbours and well built to hide traffic noise. In the fall, when I visited with my wife, the only sounds were the crashing of the waves (and the markets).
CLIENTELE A cross-section of moneyed Miami visitors. We ran into patrician Northeasterners, retired Europeans in designer bathing suits from the mall, and extended families on extended vacation - including one very noisy crew of kids, parents and grandparents who turned out to be from Toronto.
ROOMS Even the smallest rooms are nearly 600 square feet, and ours - a middle-range suite - was palatial, over 1,100 square feet. That was room enough for a comfortable living room, a full desk, comfortable bedroom and a bathroom fit for an emperor. (The latter is another Regent signature.) Oh, and there was a full kitchen, with espresso machine and a massive Wolf stove - but no pots.
Rooms are accessed by private or semi-private elevator; in other words, each elevator serves one or two suites on each floor. The likely result is that you will never see your neighbours or, indeed, anyone else, except at the pool. And here's a piece of technology and service that all luxury hotels should mimic: The doors have an electronic switch for you to signal for maid service when you go out. In other words, you can kick back with a drink and never worry about being bothered.
DESIGN The hotel's interior is a tasteful refuge for people whose natural habitat is the McMansion. It's all monolithic furniture in dark woods, granite slabs, bold colours and leather-panelled walls. But the rooms are flawlessly comfortable, and the design (by Atlanta's CMMI) is executed with ridiculous attention to detail. Every corridor and public bathroom has its subtle flourishes, a different sink or beautiful light fixture, to combat the sense of sameness that usually permeates hotels. There's even a slightly edgy Canadian touch: The dining room features a phalanx of pendant lights designed by Vancouver's Omer Arbel for his company, Bocci.
AMENITIES In keeping with Miami's growth as an art capital, the Regent has a collection including works specifically commissioned for the hotel. The staff now includes an "art butler" who will give you a guided tour. But the main draw is the 750 feet of beach. An underground passage lets you head from the elevators out to the pool and the beach, avoiding the polished main lobby. Poolside, there are large cabanas for rent if you'd like to spend the day lounging in seclusion.
And back indoors is the spa: the first Guerlain Spa in North America. It's expansive, at 10,000 square feet, beautifully decorated and designed for a truly peaceful experience, with private treatment rooms and a complete range of products and treatments.
SERVICE The Regent brand has roots in Hong Kong, and the new owners behind the brand - cruise-ship and hotel operator Carlson - have made Asian-style "anticipatory" service one of its touchstones. The results are a bit formal, but flawless. The young man at the desk (suit jacket fully buttoned) will definitely remember you. The concierge? At your service 24 hours a day. Turndown? An overnight shoeshine? But of course.
There is even a free car service within Bal Harbour; your driver awaits outside in a glinting new Mercedes. On the other hand, there's nowhere to go in Bal Harbour except the mall. One evening, a driver cheerfully broke the rules to drop us at a Cuban restaurant in low-key North Beach. It was good, too.
FOOD Simple room service and poolside snacks were flawless, if expensive; hopefully the $16 chicken clubhouse sandwiches at the pool bar have taken a price chop. We had an excellent, subtly flavoured dinner of local fish at the hotel's restaurant, 1 Bleu. Since our stay, executive chef Mark Militello - winner of the prestigious James Beard Award and longtime star on the local food scene - has taken the helm at 1 Bleu and the adjacent bar, maintaining a Mediterranean theme and focus on seafood.
WHAT TO DO If the beach, the spa and the art aren't enough, it's not that hard to hit South Beach's clubs and restaurants. The galleries and restaurants of the Miami Design
District (www. miamidesigndistrict.net), on the north edge of the city, are a quicker drive, about 10 kilometres away.

Abstract: "The investments that went to Shanghai to build all these skyscrapers and Maglev train are extraordinarily expensive and are now suffering from excess capacity," Prof. [Yasheng Huang] said in our e-mail exchange. "These investments in big buildings are financed by huge tax burdens on rural areas, which lost out in the growth." That is a problem because the countryside is home to what Prof. Huang calls "the most dynamic, risk-taking and talented entrepreneurs in China."

Full text:   Returning to Shanghai after an absence of 25 years is like stepping through a portal from past to future. The row of decaying colonial buildings that lined the famous Bund have been fixed up and taken over by stylish hotels, bars and restaurants. What was a swamp across the river in Pudong is a dazzling vista of skyscrapers and flyovers. A magnetic levitation train, the first of its kind in commercial use, whisks travellers from the airport.
More than any other place, Shanghai is a symbol of the new China. What was once a shabby, inward-looking Communist city has become a forward-looking dynamo where the animal spirits of capitalism are given free rein. Or has it?
China scholar Yasheng Huang argues that what visitors see when they visit Shanghai is a mirage. Far from being a free-market paradise, Shanghai is the creation of a controlling Communist government. Instead of demonstrating the success of China's development model, it shows how a growth-mad regime has stunted enterprise and innovation and ignored the productive potential of the countryside.
"When you examine economic data, you will see that income growth in the city was basically stagnant and that the city lagged other regions of the country in terms of entrepreneurship and technology," he said in an e-mail interview. "It is a city for aficionados of skyscrapers but nothing much else."
It is a provocative argument, to say the least - bound to annoy China's leaders, who are naturally proud of Shanghai. But as a former consultant at the World Bank and onetime professor at Harvard Business School, Prof. Huang can't be taken lightly. Now a scholar at the Sloan School of Management, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, he lays out his ideas in his 2008 book Capitalism with Chinese Characteristics: Entrepreneurship and the State . It has a whole chapter devoted to "What is wrong with Shanghai?"
In 1987, the municipal government drew up a plan to make Shanghai a world-class city by the early 21st century - an ambitious goal for a place that then had a per capita gross domestic product of less than $800 (U.S.) a year. To all appearances, it worked brilliantly. With the once-closed economy open for business, foreign investment poured in. Government helped out by building new roads, bridges, railways and port facilities.
Like Coleridge's Kubla Khan building Xanadu, the government hatched a grandiose plan to turn 350 square kilometres in Pudong into a first-class financial and commercial centre. This set the pattern for scores of other massive development projects from Beijing to Shenzhen.
"The essence of the Pudong model is deceptively simple," Prof. Huang writes. "The government, as the monopoly buyer facing no competition, was to requisition vast tracts of land from rural households at below-market prices and then auction off the land-use rights at prevailing market prices. The proceeds from the land sales were then used to finance the government's industrial-policy programs, welfare and pension obligations and last, but not least, corruption."
The result was spectacular. More than 3,000 buildings of 18 storeys and higher have risen in Shanghai since the mid-1990s. But Shanghai skyscrapers are not a sign of China dynamism, Prof. Huang argues. They are "an exact symptom of what is deeply wrong with the country." China has enjoyed galloping growth over of the past three decades partly because the government has mobilized huge amounts of capital and poured them into industrial and real estate megaprojects with little regard for their productivity in the long run. The Shanghai model, he writes, is characterized by "an urban bias, heavy-handed interventionism by the state, and an investment-intensive growth strategy and a biased liberalization that privileges FDI [foreign direct investment] over indigenous private entrepreneurship."
Prof. Huang says that, as late as 2002, nearly 40 per cent of enterprises in the city were still owned by the state, a much higher level than in surrounding provinces. Most local private sector businesses are small. Innovation, as shown by the number of patents issued, is low. In short, he contends, Shanghai is not really creating anything: Its wealth comes from foreign investors and government largesse.
It feeds off the countryside, too. Rural people have suffered as the showcase cities have grown rich. They face heavy taxes and the potential confiscation of their land, to which most farmers have only shaky legal rights.
"The investments that went to Shanghai to build all these skyscrapers and Maglev train are extraordinarily expensive and are now suffering from excess capacity," Prof. Huang said in our e-mail exchange. "These investments in big buildings are financed by huge tax burdens on rural areas, which lost out in the growth." That is a problem because the countryside is home to what Prof. Huang calls "the most dynamic, risk-taking and talented entrepreneurs in China."
Prof. Huang is not anti-China. He gives Beijing credit for the tremendous progress the country has made and the many market reforms it has introduced. He concedes that the government is trying to correct some of the distortions it has created, for instance by raising rural incomes.
But his critique of the Shanghai model is thought-provoking and timely. When he wrote his book last year, he warned of a rising bubble in the China market. Because of its unsustainable model, he wrote, "China is highly vulnerable to shocks." He was sure right about that.

Full text:   With record sums changing hands in the sales of franchises, junior hockey is no longer a mom-and-pop organization. But with increased profits comes increased responsibility to the players - and a constant drive to have people fill the seats
HOCKEY REPORTER
Diane and Joe Pritchard have found a way to combat the recession.
The proprietors of Billy's Downtown Deli decided earlier this hockey season to extend the Friday night hours for their Dundas Street diner in the hopes they would pack the place with people attending London Knights OHL games at the nearby John Labatt Centre.
The venture has been worth it. Billy's, usually open between 7:30 a.m. and 3 p.m., has been full for what the Pritchards have tabbed Friday Knights.
"Some of our regular customers are mad that we're not open when the Knights play on Thursdays, too," said Diane, whose diner was a popular eating spot when London played host to the 2005 Memorial Cup.
A few blocks east, Dolly Byard shows up for her shift at the Honest Lawyer and thinks to herself: "The Knights must be playing tonight."
The bar-restaurant has more life than usual and more people are grabbing an early bite before the Knights face off against the top-ranked junior team in the country, the Windsor Spitfires.
"This place is definitely busier when the Knights are playing," said Byard, who grew up three blocks from the old Montreal Forum, but has lived in London since 1976.
Not all businesses are thriving in downtown London because of the success of the Knights and the John Labatt Centre. There still are boarded-up stores near the 6½-year-old entertainment complex. But for the most part, since the centre opened its doors on Oct. 11, 2002, and the Knights moved in as the chief tenant, the combination has been a success story.
In cities such as London, junior hockey has become big business across Canada and the United States. But no franchise has undergone such a transformation as the Knights.
The team struggled mightily in the mid-1990s. It played in a deteriorating building on the south end of town and its on-ice performance was as horrible, setting a Canadian Hockey League record for futility at 3-60-3 in 1995-96.
Former NHL player Mark Hunter, along with his older brother, Dale, was at the old London Ice House for the final game that OHL season. The current co-owner of the Knights - then the Sarnia Sting head coach - and Stanley Cup winner with the 1988-89 Calgary Flames didn't need a degree in risk management to see the possibilities.
"Dale and I always had interest in owning a major-junior franchise one day," said Mark Hunter, 46. "I saw 4,000 people in that rink that final game. I saw 4,000 loyal fans for a team that won three games. This is a hockey city."
So when the Tarry family decided to unload ownership of the Knights, the Hunters pounced. They secured a big bank loan by putting up as collateral the mortgages from their farms and homes in nearby Petrolia, to purchase the OHL club for $3.8-million in May of 2000.
If the franchise were sold today, the Hunters could cash in for more than $11-million.
To put that in further perspective, the Spitfires sold for $75,000 in 1976.
The big plus for the Hunters was they knew a $42-million downtown rink - financed by the federal and provincial governments, the city and a public-private ownership group - was in the works.
What the Hunters needed to do was construct an entertaining and contending team to fill the 9,000-seat facility and its 38 luxury boxes.
After breaking even in the final two seasons at the Ice House, the Knights have been a top draw since. Mark Hunter said the Knights went from 1,271 season tickets when they bought the team to 7,000, with another 2,000 on the waiting list. Seldom are there less-than-capacity crowds at Knights games and the success of the 2005 Memorial Cup certainly added value to London club.
"We've been fortunate," Mark Hunter said. "We owe a lot to the city for building this gorgeous rink.
"We make money, we'll never deny that. Sometimes how much we make gets exaggerated, but we make money."
The Knights don't disclose profit totals, but with an average ticket price of $14 and 9,000 fans a game with 34 home dates, that's revenue of roughly more than $4.28-million for the regular season alone.
When asked if he is interested in selling the Knights, Mark Hunter replied this is something he and his brother plan to keep in their family for a long time.
"If you know anything about farmers, they just pass their land on down the line," he said. "I bought some farm land in 1981, and I still have it. That's what we will do with [the Knights]."
The Knights are proof junior hockey is no longer a mom-and-pop organization. Dennis Beyak, the radio voice of the NHL's Toronto Maple Leafs, spent his early years in hockey in management with the Saskatoon Blades, Seattle Thunderbirds and Tri-City Americans in the WHL.
Beyak said junior hockey used to be a business where a franchise had a small window for financial success.
"It was a situation that each team knew they would either make a profit of no more than $5,000 or lose no more than $5,000," he said.
That changed when the Edmonton Oil Kings moved to Portland, Ore., and became the Winter Hawks in 1976. All of a sudden, bigger buildings were involved - marketing and advertising became a big part of selling the junior game to fill the larger venues.
Calgary billionaire Bill Gallacher, an energy entrepreneur, purchased the team for a major-junior record $7.5-million last October - more than twice the previous ownership group paid for the Winter Hawks three years before.
Despite the WHL club's pioneering history, the previous ownership group of Jim Goldsmith, Jack Donovan and John Bryant did not see success on the ice nor with their business relationships in the community.
Speculation has Gallacher also interested in becoming a NHL owner. But, for now, he is committed to reviving the Winter Hawks and keeping the team in Portland, a condition of the sale.
"We wanted to pick it up and dust it off and give it a new set of parents, that's how I characterize what we're trying to do," Gallacher said.
The first piece of business was to bring in respected former Canadian national team coach Mike Johnston, who most recently was Marc Crawford's associate with the Vancouver Canucks and Los Angeles Kings, as well as former NHL player Travis Green as an assistant coach to rebuild the on-ice product.
Former Edmonton Oilers and Carolina Hurricanes executive Doug Piper, a local product, was hired as the Winter Hawks' president. His chief aim will be to reconnect the team with the community and its loyal fans.
"I'm a Canadian kid who grew up loving hockey, but I didn't have the talent and I can't coach, so this is a way for me to be close to the game," said Gallacher, who also is part of the ownership group with the Nanaimo Clippers of the British Columbia tier II loop.
"You have to love hockey if you're going to own a junior hockey team."
Like any business, junior hockey has its warts.
With increased profits comes an increased responsibility to the young players they employ. The post-junior university packages that are agreed to have to be paid for and executed. It's an important time in the athletes' lives.
"I have a first-hand appreciation of how kids should be treated," said Gallacher, whose 16-year-old is a defenceman with the Camrose Kodiaks of the Alberta Junior Hockey League. "Everyone has to realize that these kids are 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20, but they are only 16, 17, 18, 19 and 20.
"They have mothers and fathers who care deeply about their sons, who worry about their sons, who want to make sure that they are in a productive environment where they are looked after and developed and put on a straight path with not only hockey skills, but life skills.
"That is our main drive in Portland. We want an impeccable reputation in this area."
Not all teams have that. For every good situation, there are franchises that in recent years required an ownership change to alter a poor image.
Former Calgary Flames general manager Craig Button, who has counselled top prospects in the past as whether to play major junior or U.S. college, encourages parents to do their homework.
"This is such an important time of life for these kids," Button said. "Why would you want him to be put in a bad situation? Forget about the [NHL] draft, the good ones can dictate where they should play. Find out the good situations, the good environments. Even if the kid is going to play U.S. college hockey, there are bad programs there, too."
Button acknowledges that not all prospects can dictate their new addresses. But as the number of quality environments increase, the pressure is on the bad franchises to clean up suspect reputations.
A few years ago, the once mighty Kamloops franchise was on thin ice. The Blazers had won Memorial Cups in 1992, 1994 and 1995. But a decade later, the on-ice product had deteriorated and the community-owned team's financial picture was in disarray because of a scandal in which a long-term office manager had embezzled more than $1-million. (She was subsequently given a 3½-year jail sentence.)
Enter NHL players Darryl Sydor and Mark Recchi. They honed their skills in junior with the Blazers and wanted to see the franchise return to its winning ways.
They recruited Kamloops native Tom Gaglardi, who owns Vancouver-based Northland Properties, the parent company to Sandman Hotels, Denny's Restaurants of Canada, Moxie's Restaurants, Shark Clubs and other real estate and hospitality businesses, and former Blazers players Jarome Iginla and Shane Doan. The fivesome banded together to buy the Blazers.
After two years and two bids, the Blazers were sold for more than $6-million to the celebrity group and the rebuilding began.
"In my opinion, if this franchise carried on with a community ownership, it would have continued to deteriorate," Gaglardi said.
Gaglardi believes that owning a major junior hockey team can be a big business. But it has to be done right.
"The reality is that in order to survive, entrepreneurial abilities are required," he said. "Some teams that are community owned with cumbersome boards, like the Blazers were, are going to get passed."
Gaglardi points to big-market junior teams such as Calgary, Edmonton and Vancouver that attract crowds as large as 10,000 or more, saying smaller markets such as Kamloops have to keep up with corporate sponsorship deals. But before corporate involvement can be lured, people have to fills the seats in order to make the investments made by local businesses worthwhile.
"It's a complicated business now, simply because there is more competition for the entertainment dollar," Gaglardi said. "There are other options out there.
"It's a different game now [off the ice]."

Only in Canada do 16-year-old boys move from their family homes to play in towns such as Kamloops, Moose Jaw, Owen Sound and Baie-Comeau, most every one with the dream of some day playing in the NHL. Globe and Mail sportswriters across the country report on the phenomenon of major-junior hockey in a five-part series.

ATHLETES' PLAY HELPS PAY THE TEAM'S BILLS, BUT CAN THEY AFFORD TO PAY THEIR OWN?
When Sidney Crosby was 16 and leaving Shattuck-Saint Mary's prep school in Faribault, Minn., in 2003, the native of Cole Harbour, N.S., could have chosen his next destination. But the small-market Rimouski Oceanic held the first overall selection in the QMJHL draft, and he had no hesitation to play in its 4,285-capacity Colisee.
What calmed Crosby's nerves was a phone from Brad Richards. The current Dallas Stars centre played there with Tampa Bay Lighting star Vincent Lecavalier and won a Memorial Cup in 2000.
"I knew the past players really enjoyed their experience [in Rimouski] and that the people there were passionate about hockey," said Crosby, who was selected first overall in the 2005 NHL draft by the Pittsburgh Penguins. "I really feel lucky to have played in Rimouski. I wasn't going to play that game of whether there was a question of going to college or holding out and playing for another team."
Rimouski's first-rate organization was rewarded not only with a trip to the 2005 Memorial Cup in London, but the community was chosen to play host to the CHL championship tournament this May.
"It's huge," Crosby said. "They haven't been a great team every year, yet the people still support the team. You can't say that about every franchise in junior."
Crosby was reportedly paid handsomely for his two seasons in Rimouski. But the speculation that he received a small percentage of the gate or a six-figure salary has been rigorously denied by all parties. When Patrick Kane (now with the Chicago Blackhawks) spent the 2006-07 OHL campaign with the Knights, two sources claim the player made anywhere between $30,000 and $40,000.
Some bigger-name junior players have been paid per point or per win, but for the most part it's a small sum a week, plus room and board at a trusted billet's house.
In the WHL, players' pay increases with years of service in the league. Veterans who have cars and drive their teammates around are reimbursed gas money.
Calgary Flames defenceman Cory Sarich graduated from junior in 1998, but he remembers what he made with the Saskatoon Blades and Seattle Thunderbirds.
"As a 17-year-old I was making $73.50 [a week] and as a 19-year-old I was making $89," said Sarich, who was traded to the Seattle Thunderbirds in his final junior season. "When I got traded to Seattle, I was making about $200 U.S. a week and I thought I was loaded because at the time the exchange rate was so high."
Could Sarich get by financially in his earlier days in Saskatoon?
"You needed parental help," he said. "Not all of us did, but it's just like a university student who needs spending money from their parents, most of us needed financial help from our parents. It sure taught us to take care of your money and try not to eat out too much."
Toronto Maple Leafs forward Brad May recalled his weekly pay with the OHL's Niagara Falls Thunder was $58.75.
"That would barely allow you to have a Big Mac, fries and drink every day, as well as a movie once in a while," May said. "My parents helped me out. You find a way because you are chasing a dream of playing pro hockey."
In the OHL, the weekly pay varies depending on which round the player is selected in.
Why has pay remained low in junior, while profits have soared among the bigger market clubs?
Some owners or coaches liken the situation to an apprenticeship. Others point to the university scholarship program in the CHL, which varies from league-to-league but can be summarized as: players earn a year of postsecondary school for each season they play.
"People get hung up on what we pay these kids, but that's only one aspect," Kamloops Blazers majority owner Tom Gaglardi said. "We look after these kids. We put them in school and make sure they are going to classes. The older ones, we pay for their university courses. We make sure they have great billets and are fed properly. We treat the guys pretty well.
"Overall, if you want an apprenticeship to play pro hockey, there is no better place. And if that doesn't work out, if a player spends four or five years in this league, they can get a free education and go play hockey at a Canadian university. That's the real cost for teams going forward."
Sarich was asked if he feels teams do enough for the players.
"I think a kid needs to be comfortable," he said. "It's a tough sled, playing junior hockey and going to school. It costs close to $60 to fill up your [gas] tank these days. You want these kids to not have to worry about how little they have in their pocket.
"But I can see both sides. Leaving home at an early age and being on your own is a great tool to grow up in a hurry."

Full text:   Available downtown office space is at an historic low, threatening to stifle growth when economy rebounds
When Bermuda-based reinsurance company Flagstone Reinsurance Holdings Ltd. was looking around the world four years ago for a spot to house a new data management centre, downtown Halifax became the perfect pick.
With three local universities, the city offered the fast-growing company a highly educated work force, as well as the information technology infrastructure it needed, and Canada was closer to Bermuda than many other international possibilities it scouted, making business travel affordable.
Over the four years since Flagstone set up in Halifax, its staff has grown to more than 100 employees from 15, says chief marketing officer Brent Slade.
With that growth, it has almost maxed out its single-floor, 15,000-square-foot location in Scotia Square, a major Halifax office tower. If it keeps expanding as it has, Mr. Slade says he soon will run out of room. "If we continue to grow like we have, we could come to the extent of our facility by the end of the year," he says.
When that happens, Mr. Slade may be hard-pressed to find enough available office space downtown to expand.
Thanks to an influx of international finance and IT firms such as Flagstone, as well as a lengthy and unpredictable approval process delaying new development, available office space is at an historic low in downtown Halifax.
Research firm Colliers International has pegged the vacancy rate for Class A space at 1.3 per cent, or effectively zero. This dearth of available office space has some industry insiders concerned that a lack of room could stifle the city's ability to conduct business today and in the future.
"We're at a tipping point," says Stephen Lund, chief executive officer of Nova Scotia Business Inc.
In recent years, the provincial economic development agency has successfully lobbied major finance and IT companies such as Waterloo, Ont.-based BlackBerry maker Research In Motion Inc. and Bermuda-based finance giant Butterfield Fund Services to set up offices in Halifax.
And while the influx of new businesses to the city may slow this year because of the global recession, Mr. Lund says he's concerned that, when the economy rebounds, the city may not be able to accommodate more growth.
"If we don't do anything to create more space, our growth will stop," he says.
Mr. Lund isn't the only one concerned. While landlords and leasing agents can accommodate requests for a few thousand square feet, there's no room left downtown for a large-scale tenant, says Tim Margolian, vice-president of investment sales for DTZ Barnicke, a real estate advisory in Halifax.
"If you wanted to put in a floor plate of 20,000 square feet, it would be virtually impossible today."
Halifax isn't the only city hard up for Class A office space - vacancy rates in downtown Vancouver, Calgary and Ottawa are similar, according to statistics from real estate firm CB Richard Ellis.
But in Halifax the problem is exacerbated because the downtown is one of the most difficult jurisdictions in Canada to develop thanks to ambiguous land-use bylaws and powerful heritage groups that have often opposed new office towers, Mr. Margolian says.
For instance, late last year the Waterside Centre, a six-storey glass-and-brick building that could have been the city's first new office tower in 20 years, was rejected by Halifax Regional Municipality's council for not conforming to bylaws that dictate additions to heritage buildings be "subordinate" to the original structures. The proposed development had previously been approved by the city's planning department but met strong opposition from heritage groups that turned out to public hearings in large numbers. Waterside developer Ben McCrea is currently appealing council's decision before the Nova Scotia Utility and Review Board.
The combination of business growth and downtown development woes has pushed many new office developments outward, says CB Richard Ellis senior vice-president Robert Mussett. "There's lots of office space in the suburbs," he says, referring to Halifax's two main suburban office markets, the Bayers Lake and City of Lakes business parks.
But while some new entrants to Halifax such as RIM and defence contractor General Dynamics Corp. have recently opened large offices in suburban areas, others need to be in the heart of the city.
"Our employees are young, highly educated, and cosmopolitan and they want to be downtown," Mr. Slade says. "The suburbs aren't a good option for us."
Moreover, because Flagstone has invested "significantly" in enhancing bandwidth and other IT infrastructure at its existing location, Mr. Slade says he's not keen on uprooting and incurring those expenses all over again.
One expansion option the company may consider is subleasing or taking over leases from businesses on neighbouring floors as they became available.
For firms eager to stay downtown, subleasing is one of the few available options, says Mr. Musset of CB Richard Ellis. That's because the economic downturn is slowly driving up sublease availability as businesses look to cut costs by shedding floor space they don't need.
"Some tenants are pulling back on their space requirements and may sublet to others who need it," he says.
The only other option for tenants who don't want to be outside the downtown core is to hang tight, says Brian Toole, a partner with international commercial brokerage Partners Global in Halifax.
"There is space in the pipeline, but it will take a few years for it to come on stream," he says, referring to developments such as Crombie REIT's proposed 22-storey downtown International Space, which has all the necessary permits and is currently securing leasing.
HRM by Design, a new municipal planning strategy that promises to streamline building bylaws and speed up the approval process, could make future downtown development easier.
But with at least three years to go before any new Class A office space enters the downtown, that might not be fast enough to accommodate growing firms like Flagstone, or others interested in relocating to Halifax, Mr. Slade says.
"A lack of space could ultimately prove to be a hindrance to growth in Halifax," he says.

Full text:   Condition of chopper indicates 'significant impact,' search leader says, as efforts focus on bringing victims home to their families
Working nearly 180 metres below the North Atlantic, a remote-operated sub was able to retrieve one body from the "busted-up" wreckage of last week's helicopter crash before the recovery crew ran into delays.
Cougar Helicopters flight 91 was carrying 18 people when it ditched into the sea off Newfoundland and sank Thursday during a routine run to the offshore oil platforms. One person survived, two are now confirmed dead and the remainder are presumed dead.
Transportation Safety Board team leader Mike Cunningham said yesterday that examination of the scene indicated at least 10 to 13 bodies were still aboard, though he stressed there could be more in the wreckage or the surrounding area.
The crash also appears to have left the helicopter in worse shape than initially thought. As a result, plans to raise the wreckage were shelved in favour of immediate body recovery.
"We didn't want to lose any," Mr. Cunningham told reporters. "Our priority, the first priority, is the bodies."
They had quick success, bringing to the surface one of the people missing after the helicopter crashed. But the recovery then slowed down.
Mr. Cunningham was vague about the reasons for the delay, saying they had to "make sure we do it properly." He later noted that the nature of the wreckage may have made that one body, the name of which was not released, easier to access than the others.
"It's quite a mess, it's quite a jumble down there," Mr. Cunningham said. "[The] aircraft is busted up pretty good, which would indicate a significant impact."
The helicopter was on a regular flight to the oil rigs off Newfoundland when it experienced mechanical problems and crashed into the cold waters of the North Atlantic. The lone survivor among the 16 passengers and two crew members, Robert Decker, remains in critical condition and unable to describe the final moments of the flight.
"He was revived for a period of time on Friday and showed awareness of his surroundings and the family members who were with him," Mr. Decker's family said in a statement released Saturday.
"However, the ventilator prevented him from speaking. He continues to be heavily sedated and in stable, but critical condition. We continue to pray for his full recovery."
Over the weekend, police released the names of most of those aboard the doomed aircraft. Thomas Anwyll and Tim Lanouette were from British Columbia and Ken MacRae was from Nova Scotia. But most of them - Peter Breen, Gary Corbett, Wade Drake, Wade Duggan, Corey Eddy, Colin Henley, Allison Maher (found Thursday), Derrick Mullowney, Burch Nash, John Pelley and Paul Pike - were from Newfoundland.
Ms. Maher, a 26-year-old native of one of the string of small villages near St. John's that lost several people in this disaster, was remembered yesterday afternoon at a visitation in Fermeuse.
A steady stream of people poured through the doors of the local funeral home - far more than live in the tiny community, a sign of how widely her loss is being felt.
But even as they mourned, her relatives recognized the additional burden of pain felt by the families of the other crash victims.
"Our thoughts are to Allison, and our grieving process," Jim Maher told The Canadian Press. "But we're thinking about the other ... families and, for want of a better word, our good fortune that we at least have her body and we're able to mourn her."
Relatives of other victims have made clear their burning desire to retrieve the bodies as soon as possible and Mr. Cunningham said that the recovery effort is a 24-hour-a-day job.
"Every family member that I've spoken to, that is the ultimate goal right now, that's what they want," said Hank Williams, operations manager for Cougar Helicopters.
"[It's] very important from our perspective that the next step is to bring their people home."
The recovery team has also brought up parts of the helicopter's main door, the aft cargo door and one of the emergency exit doors. Still to be retrieved are the flight data recorders and the main gearbox, with which the pilot reported having problems when he issued his mayday call.

A partial list of the victims
Wade Drake, 42, Fortune.
He moved to Fortune, Nfld., from a neighbouring community within the last few years and built a house. He was married with two daughters.
Burch Nash, 44, Fortune
He grew up in Fortune and his parents still live in the community. Fortune Mayor Alec Noseworthy said his son was close friends with Burch, who moved away from the town after finishing high school, and then settled near St. John's.
Wade Duggan, 32,
Witless Bay, NFLD.
Don Drew, mayor of Bay Bulls, said he remembers helping Duggan look for a piece of land in the area before he married and built a house in Witless Bay.
Ken MacRae, 47,
Greenwood, N.S.
He was a technician with Alberta-based FGG Inspections. It's thought Mr. MacRae retired from the Armed Forces several years ago and took on casual jobs on the rigs.
Derrick Mullowney, 51,
Bay Bulls, NFLD.
Worked in the offshore for about 30 years. He worked as a steward for East Coast Catering.
Allison Maher, 26,
Aquaforte, Nfld.
Relatives of the only woman on board the helicopter described her as a "spitfire." She worked in catering and housekeeping.
Colin Henley, 38, St. John's
He was on his first trip to the oil platforms. He had retrained from a career in real estate to become a weather observer for Provincial Aerospace Ltd.
John Pelley, 41, Deer Lake
He was a nurse and worked regularly for the oil industry.
Peter Breen, 55, St. John's
He worked for East Coast Catering, one of five people on board who worked for the company.
Tim Lanouette, 48,
Comox, B.C.
A pilot, he was the flight's first officer.
*****
Recovery mission
A team is working to find the victims of Thursday's helicopter crash off Newfoundland. One person survived, two are confirmed dead and the remaining 15 are presumed dead
The crane on the Atlantic Osprey is capable of lifting 50 tonnes.
The ROV (remotely operated underwater vehicle) is able to extract the bodies, one at a time, from the wreck and place them in a basket which is lifted to the surface.
The Sikorsky S-92 lies around 178 metres below the surface. Since the fuselage is quite damaged, it cannot be lifted intact. There may be as many as 13 bodies inside.

This 935-square-foot corner suite is one of more than 50 units in a popular midtown residence where homeowners appreciate the proximity to the subway, recreational facilities and local shops, agent Andrea Stark says.
The boutique building also houses a gym, party room and rooftop deck with a barbecue station, in addition to other conveniences such as visitor parking.
"It's an amazing building," Ms. Stark says. "It backs onto a greenbelt north of Mount Pleasant Cemetery, so it's got nice walking and jogging paths behind it."
The suite offers a spacious two-bedroom, two-bathroom plan that rarely comes available in the former office building, which was converted into a condominium in the late 1990s. "There are a lot of very small units in the building," she explains. "This is the biggest."
While most units are stylishly dressed, the seller enhanced its appearance with new granite counters and slate and wood floors, plus a custom built-in banquette and granite table in the dining area. "It's just gorgeous," Ms. Stark says of the overall effect.
The principal room also has a Juliette balcony and windows on the north and east walls.
Other attractive features include nine-foot ceilings, a pantry, laundry machines and a four-piece bathroom off the carpeted master suite.
The monthly fee is $466, which does not include utilities. A parking spot and locker are included.

Full text: What is a "jobless recovery"?
Between 1950 and 1990, every time the economy recovered from a dip into recession, there were substantial numbers of new jobs that were created.
But after the recession of 1990-91, very few new jobs opened up when the economy bounced back, thus creating a "jobless recovery." Unemployment remained high until 1994.
Essentially, companies managed to squeeze more productivity out of a smaller work force, partly through the use of new technology.
That strategy was good for profits and the stock market, but it left many workers out in the cold.
It happened again, to a lesser degree, in the early years of this decade, when the economy was rebounding from a mild recession and employment increases were sporadic.
Why is gold considered a hedge against inflation and a safe haven?
Traditionally, gold has been considered a safe haven because it is fairly easy to buy and sell, has intrinsic value all over the world, and has been highly valued for millennia. Many countries also based their currencies on the value of gold for a long time.
But gold's performance as a hedge depends on what period you choose.
In some high-inflation years, gold has appreciated more sharply than the rise in the cost of living.
But over certain long periods - the two decades between 1980 and 2000, for example - gold was certainly not a good hedge against inflation.
The cost of living rose sharply during that stretch but the price of gold plunged.
Over the past eight or nine years, however, the price of gold has sharply outpaced the rate of inflation.
Can a husband and wife have joint ownership of a Tax-Free Savings Account? For estate-planning purposes, we like to have our investments held jointly.
The TFSA rules make it clear that each spouse must have a separate account.
There are no joint accounts allowed. The TFSA is similar to an RRSP in many ways, and this is one of them.
As with an RRSP, if your spouse or common-law partner is the sole beneficiary of your TFSA, when you die the account will be transferred immediately to his or her name without any tax consequences.
When organizations such as the Canadian Real Estate
Association report house sales figures for a particular month, do they count a sale when the deal is negotiated or when it closes?
CREA says it counts the sale as taking place when an offer to purchase is accepted without any conditions.
That's the same criteria used by the local real estate boards across the country.
Until there is a firm offer, a deal can't be counted. And the boards don't wait until closing, because the timing varies widely from house to house, and that data are not as easily gathered.

This 2,453-square-foot bungalow was listed in May, 2008, the same time the Vancouver market "took a significant turn," agent Sue Johnson says. In November, Ms. Johnson reduced the original asking price of $1,158,000 to $998,000, which she felt was "competitive, comparable and reflected the market."
As a result, she generated two competing offers that pushed the sale above the final listing price.
"The new owner is a local resident who purchased the property as an investment for the future," Ms. Johnson says.
The four-bedroom, two-bathroom home was constructed in 1949 and completely remodelled in 2001. It has hardwood floors, a new kitchen with stainless steel appliances and granite countertops, and a spa-inspired master bathroom.
The house is located on an 8,551-square-foot lot with a west-facing deck and gardens in the rear yard. The South Granville address means shopping, parks, downtown and the beach are just minutes away.
"This is a prime example of a local buyer who realized a significant real estate opportunity on the marketplace today," Ms. Johnson says.
"We are finding that sales activity has almost doubled daily since the beginning of February along with consumer confidence," she adds.

Full text: In the ever-expanding universe of video games, the big bucks are in blood and guts.
Some kids get hooked on Guitar Hero , but the vast majority of gamers today spend more money - and time - on shockingly graphic search-and-destroy video games. Turning every violent teen male fantasy into reality, these games have a simple primal theme: kill, and kill again. And then keep killing.
Rated M for Mature, violent franchise entries such as Gears of War , Grand Theft Auto and Call of Duty are the top sellers in the billion-dollar video-game industry, which last year made more money than the movie and music industries combined. Video games have become the new killing fields for today's young male gamer.
But at what cost? The issue of impressionable minds falling too deeply into the world of video-game violence is treated very seriously in the report titled Top Gun , airing on tonight's the fifth estate (CBC, tonight at 9 p.m.).
Written and hosted by Gillian Findlay, the hour-long program updates a high-profile story from last fall. News media swarmed upon Barrie, Ont., where hundreds of people were searching fields for a missing teen named Brandon Crisp. The story ran nationally, and on CNN, because 15-year-old Brandon had run away from home when his parents took away his Xbox gaming system; he had become obsessed with the video game Call of Duty , and was playing all hours of the day and night. Brandon was so enraged, said his parents, that he took his backpack and left on his bike, which he hadn't ridden in years.
A $50,000 reward was offered. People searched three weeks before Brandon's body was found at the base of a tree, barely five kilometres from his home; he died of injuries consistent with a fall.
The tragic discovery ended the story for most people. Findlay's report expands upon the sadly short life of Brandon Crisp, which required investigation of the violent video-game business itself. Filming the story held personal resonance for Findlay, the mother of a 16-year-old male with his own gaming system.
"As a parent, I was shocked by how little I knew about this world," says the CBC news veteran. "The violence of these games is so real and beauty of the graphics is almost overwhelming. You can see how seductive these games can be to teenage players."
In an exclusive interview with Brandon's parents, taped between the time of his disappearance and the discovery of his body, the extent of their son's video-game obsession is revealed.
A nice kid, a good student and a decent hockey player, Brandon's slight size caused him to drift away from athletics at age 12 and gradually ease into the world of video games. Brandon would never play in the National Hockey League, but in the role-player universe of Call of Duty , he was a killing machine. The sense of power can be euphoric. "Some kids are simply more susceptible than others," says Findlay. "The game became a place for him to succeed."
Brandon was particularly talented at Call of Duty , reveals one of his young friends, and in the weeks before his death he was climbing the circuit of the online version of the game. The confiscation of his game system kept him from training for an upcoming tournament, so he left home.
Brandon Crisp was not an isolated instance. In an interview, a rural family therapist reveals he is treating more cases of video-game addiction these days, and that parents are at wits end in dealing with it. Findlay talks to a child psychologist about the long-term impact of exposing young minds to the sustained video-game violence. "We haven't taken it as seriously as we should," he warns.
Digging deeper into the video-game culture, Findlay interviews a spokesperson from one of the big game manufacturers - she refuses comment on the Brandon Crisp case - and the CEO of Major League Gaming, operators of the site gamebattle.com, wherein gamers from all over the world engage in organized competition.
"In many ways, MLG operates under the radar," Findlay says. "There is nothing online to weed out the younger kids."
MLG also operates big-ticket tournaments, with substantial cash prizes going to those players with the best killing skills. Findlay sits down with the members of a Canadian team of professional gamers, who receive sponsorship from a cola company. Video games are a full-time career for the four twentysomethings, who have gamer names like G-Spot and X-Factor; one admits to playing 16 hours a day, possibly accounting for the group's collective fixed gaze.
"When we talked to them, we had large monitors playing video-game footage as background, and you could see it: They couldn't take their eyes off the screens," says Findlay.
While typically objective, the fifth estate episode will likely rattle some viewers, particularly those parents who suspect their own children might be addicted to violent role-player games (hours of muffled gunfire and explosions from your child's bedroom are a dead giveaway). Along with the usual adolescent vices, video-game violence has almost become a rite of passage for kids today.
Like many other male teens, Findlay's son went through his own phase of playing Call of Duty with friends. "He'll still play that game occasionally, but he lost interest," says Findlay, a hint of relief in her voice. "For him, it was a passing thing."

Full text: Foreign investors who rushed into China in recent years now fear the nation's insolvency laws could leave them with nothing
Foreign lenders who rushed into China in recent years are watching nervously as a number of companies there teeter on the brink of insolvency. Their worry: The nation's bankruptcy laws may leave them with virtually nothing.
Several big Western investors - Citigroup Inc. , hedge-fund manager Citadel Investment Group LLC , Credit Suisse Group and CLSA Capital Partners - are seeking to get back between $100-million and $200-million (U.S.) in loans extended to a Chinese steel maker, according to people familiar with the matter. While they might recoup some of the money under a restructuring, a liquidation could wipe out the loans, one of these people said.
The company, FerroChina Ltd. , a maker of galvanized steel, didn't return phone calls or e-mails seeking comment.
Investors are also nervously watching China's real-estate markets, where ratings firm Standard & Poor's said this week a number of troubled companies pose default risk.
Meanwhile, holders of $1.2-billion in debt issued by Asia Aluminum Holdings Ltd. are considering a buyback offer that would shave nearly three quarters of the value off their debt, if not more. The Chinese company said yesterday that bondholders would get less than 4¢ on the dollar if the offer fails and the company was immediately liquidated.
For lenders doing business in China and contemplating insolvency proceedings, "you don't go there unless you have to," said David Kidd, head of restructuring at the Hong Kong office of U.S. law firm Allen & Overy.
The problem: China offers virtually no road map for overseas investors facing a liquidation or restructuring. A new bankruptcy law went into effect in June 2007 that laid out procedures for companies forced into liquidation. But the courts have yet to indicate how they view claims from foreign investors.
"The key thing is the new law hasn't been tested to any extent," said Tony Stringer, head of corporate debt in Asia-Pacific at Fitch Ratings.
Fitch warned yesterday that investors need to pay attention to how bond offerings from China are structured. It cited weak corporate governance at some closely held companies, as well the presence of domestic lenders willing to step in with their own help, knocking foreign debt holders further down the ladder.
China is seen long-term as a booming market for debt investors. According to Thomson Reuters, Chinese companies have issued $2.8-billion in U.S. dollar-denominated corporate bonds since 2005, though issuance dropped last year as the credit crisis worsened and many companies began issuing bonds in the local currency.
Lending in China has taken other forms. In the now-ailing property sector, for example, hedge funds lent capital to private developers in the hopes that these fledgling companies would later sell shares to the public, allowing them to cash out once debt was converted to equity.
But others during the boom times were skeptical. Murky recovery procedures contributed to the small number of leveraged buyout deals done in China over the years. In a management-led buyout three years ago, Asia Aluminum turned to public investors rather than the syndicated-loan groups that typically sponsor leveraged buyouts.
In China, borrowers often pledge shares as collateral in an offshore entity. In return, foreign lenders agree to provide loans that are subordinated to senior credit extended by mainland lenders. But a bankruptcy could leave those collateral shares worthless.
China has managed to avoid major hits from bad loans from real estate and other investments that have hurt Western lenders, and its economy is still growing. Still, a number of companies in weakened industries or dependent on the slowing export market have been hit hard by the global downturn.
Standard & Poor's, in a report this week on potential defaults in China's real-estate industry, said Neo-China Land Group (Holdings) Ltd. presents a 50-50 chance of default in the next six months. The company couldn't be reached yesterday for comment.
In January, the company missed an interest payment on $400-million in corporate bonds, though it later repaid bondholders during the 30-day grace period. Although it has about $2-billion Hong Kong ($258-million) in cash on hand, the company has two payment obligations that exceed that amount coming up this year, according to S & P.

Hitting the streets

Abstract: According to Doug LePatourel, a Colliers representative in Vancouver, the [Kiehl]'s store, at 1025 Robson, is one of the 10 best units on this strip. One reason is that it's next to a courtyard, creating a pseudo corner location even though the store is mid-block. "Corners offer higher exposure because you get more frontage and the potential to wrap signage around," he says.

Full text: In 2004, Kiehl's, an upscale cosmetics company, decided to add a Vancouver location to the downtown Toronto store it had opened a year earlier. Because Kiehl's eschews advertising in favour of product sampling and word of mouth, it wanted a high-visibility storefront in a neighbourhood where regular passersby might make repeat visits.
The company asked the location advisory services arm of Colliers International to evaluate prospective sites based on area demographics, traffic patterns and nearby retailers. While Statistics Canada census reports provide much of this information, commercial real estate firms can help retailers isolate the most relevant criteria in graphs and maps that compare various neighbourhoods or locations. Major chains do such granular analysis as a matter of course but, according to Mary Mowbray, manager of the retail group at Colliers, small retailers rarely seek it out. "It would be very useful for many independents," she says. "But a lot of businesses think all they need to do is find an available site."
In the Kiehl's case, the preliminary research focused the search on a busy stretch of downtown Robson Street. "You almost think of it as an outdoor mall," says Kristin Armstrong, general manager of Kiehl's Canada. With pedestrian traffic comprising professionals living in the area, downtown workers, and tourists coming off buses and cruise ships, the location seemed well-suited to Kiehl's needs. But before signing a lease, the retailer wanted to dig deeper. Here's what it found out.
*****
THE NEIGHBOURS
Retailers look for both competitive and complementary stores. In Kiehl's case, the latter were a more important factor. "They wanted retailers around in which they could imagine their customers shopping," says Mowbray. Freedman Shoes, a popular independent chain, and Lululemon were two stores likely to attract consumers interested in Kiehl's products. As for nearby rivals like Aveda and Lush, Mowbray says Kiehl's wasn't concerned as long as its location was more prominent.
THE ADDRESS
According to Doug LePatourel, a Colliers representative in Vancouver, the Kiehl's store, at 1025 Robson, is one of the 10 best units on this strip. One reason is that it's next to a courtyard, creating a pseudo corner location even though the store is mid-block. "Corners offer higher exposure because you get more frontage and the potential to wrap signage around," he says. Kiehl's liked this roughly 1,000-square-foot unit so much that it waited more than a year for the previous tenant's lease to expire. That tenant, Lush, didn't want to move. But, says LePatourel, "we made it worth their while."
THE VIBE
The 1000 and 1100 blocks of Robson Street are the sine qua non of Vancouver retail, in part because, as with all good retail areas, they balance large and small stores, and the posh and quirky. "There's a progression in retail development," says Mowbray. Certain businesses (restaurants, high-end clothing stores) tend to locate together partly because of zoning, drawing more established players in the category. "But if those streets lose the interest of small retailers, they lose the energy," she says.
THE SALES
Knowing the sales per square foot at nearby stores helps a retailer estimate its own potential business volume. While malls track this data and make it available to prospective tenants, sales information on street locations is difficult to obtain, says Colliers' LePatourel. But major realtors collect it from their clients, affording them rough estimates of neighbourhood business by category; for example, the designer-boutique stretch of Bloor Street West in Toronto averages $700 to $900 in sales per square foot. Colliers' dozen or so Robson clients provided enough info to serve as a sales gauge for Kiehl's.
THE TRAFFIC
Block-by-block traffic figures provide a snapshot of how busy the street is at different times of day. While both the Thurlow and Burrard intersections have relatively high pedestrian and vehicle numbers, their peak times differ: Burrard and Robson is busiest in late morning and at lunchtime, while Thurlow packs them in during morning and afternoon rush hours. But retailers can go further, to find out, for example, how many cars drive in the curb lanes (from which they can park more easily), the number of bicyclists, and the volume of pedestrians on each side of the street. This last detail can be vital for retailers whose sales correlate to times of day: A coffee shop wants lots of passersby in the morning, while a takeout joint will care more about the evening trade.
HOW KIEHL'S FOUND ITS 'HOOD
In 2007, Colliers surveyed the options for a second Kiehl's store in Vancouver. This time, it focused on three mall locations within 10 minutes of at least 100 existing buyers, as Kiehl's wanted to tap repeat business by getting closer to its customers (represented by red dots). This density map was among the tools Colliers produced.
Demographics
This map was accompanied by a detailed demo analysis within a radius of one, three and five kilometres of Kiehl's existing store. The size, age and income of the local population all matter, but most retailers don't stop there. Children's clothing stores, for example, want to be near young families while home-improvement outlets cozy up to homeowners.
Customer density
Using the retailer's data, a location adviser can not only map where customers live, but can graph public transit and major arteries to show accessibility. In this map, for example, Kiehl's can see that transportation options make Oakridge Centre a better bet for tapping existing customers than Richmond Centre.

Full text: The Canadian economy shrank by 3.4 per cent in the last three months of 2008, as you probably know by now. But did you know that last December produced record revenues for the Toronto Parking Authority? Or that ridership on the Toronto Transit Commission continues to climb, and is now at least 3 per cent higher than it was in January, 2008?
And what are we to make of the fact that cranes still stubbornly swing above so many building sites downtown? The national economy was collapsing like a media stock in January when the developers of the 66-storey Shangri-La condominium bought an ad (thanks, guys) to proclaim their acquisition of a $408-million loan to build the thing, which they are now doing.
Even if he wanted to help Toronto, which is doubtful, Finance Minister Jim Flaherty could never hope to create such a potent and focused stimulus as that. But the Shangri-La is only one of several large developments actively under construction in downtown Toronto. Just as surprisingly, applications to build more continue to flood into city hall.
Some projects have been quietly shelved or delayed, but only one of them - a specialized office building that is part of the MaRS research centre - has stopped in mid-construction. So far, there is no 21st-century equivalent of the notorious Adelaide Street "stump" that stood for more than a decade as testament to the speculative excess of the 1980s. Instead, a renewed Bay-Adelaide Centre is now preparing to welcome its first tenants.
The last big real-estate bust arrived in one fell swoop. Long-established industry giants disappeared in a matter of months. This one is slinking into town on tippy-toes.
"I believe that Toronto is in the best shape of any city in North America," said developer Stephen Diamond, who has been involved in both the Shangri-La and the 55-storey Four Seasons project in Yorkville, which also began construction in the face of the worst national economy in 40 years. "Buyers are closing, projects are going ahead and there are still people buying units."
"We're certainly suffering," he added, "but it's like there's this bubble over the city." Housing prices have dropped, but not nearly as much as they have in Vancouver or even Calgary.
Few observers, including Mr. Diamond, expect the bubble to last. But for the time being, at least, it certainly sets the city apart.
Many point to the site of One Bloor East - the super-tall apartment building that incited a buying frenzy when it was proposed at the height of the boom - as a crucial test. The project stalled when its major lender, Lehman Brothers of New York, went bust last fall. But developer Bazis International is still active at city hall, having agreed last week to pay more than $1-million to acquire a laneway adjacent to its site.
The company's consistent refusal to respond to media inquiries about the project's status invites suspicion. But as of now, the project's a go. So are two similar projects on Bloor Street West, currently under construction. Last week, Bazis submitted an application to build another one on property it owns across from the Royal Ontario Museum.
Nobody expects Toronto's resiliency to survive the macroeconomic shocks that are sure to arrive as a result of the global financial crisis. In the meantime, though, private investors continue to pump billions of dollars into the local economy.

Full text: But industry may be turning a corner, experts say
Vancouver building permits - the sign of health in the local construction industry and an important part of the city budget - plunged in January to half the previous year's number.
Only 34 new residential units were built in the city that month, according to the finalized summary from the city's director of licences, Will Johnston, which was distributed to councillors late last week.
That grim news means that Vancouver is now projecting to get only half of its normal $25-million in fees related to development this year - a scenario that's being echoed to some degree in other Lower Mainland municipalities.
But Vancouver's finance committee chair and many people in the development industry say the region may be turning a corner.
"The February numbers will inform us more and so will March, but we may have seen the worst of it," said Councillor Raymond Louie, who is monitoring the numbers for signs that the city should tighten its budget belt even more.
There is a sign of hope: Development consultant Bob Ransford said the company he works for will be putting in an application to develop 900-1,300 units in Vancouver's Collingwood Village on the far eastern side of the city. That site, now single family homes that have been assembled by the Waterfront Group, would become part of the dense new neighbourhood that has been developed there over the past decade.
"We know it will take some time to get it approved, but they're optimistic that that the market will return," said Mr. Ransford. Although the company isn't making any construction commitments, even putting in an application requires paying significant fees to the city.
Mr. Ransford and others familiar with the development industry say they are hearing through the grapevine that there are signs of life in the housing market. More people are starting to appear at presentation centres and "people are writing deals," said Mr. Ransford.
The development company Amacon recently moved forward another step with its commitment to building a condo project at Homer and Smithe called the Beasley, which required a very large cheque for the city.
Al Poettcker, the head of the province's development industry association, said there are signs that sellers and buyers are beginning to come to terms with a new, lowered price for condos, at around $500 a square foot. In Vancouver, downtown condos had been selling, prior to the crash last year, for anywhere from $800 to $1,200 a square foot.
"There seems to be a bit of a bottom in prices," said Mr. Poettcker, who has been through six housing market crashes during his career. For the industry to really get moving again, though, he said, "it will take a better match-up of buyers and sellers."
For the past several months, developers haven't had a clear idea of what people are willing to pay, since most developers were reluctant to lower prices and, as a result, consumers simply sat on their hands.
But once the two sides establish a meeting point on prices, that will encourage developers to start looking at deals again, Mr. Poettcker said.
However, they may have to finance them differently. Many buyers are reluctant now, even at good prices, to make a commitment to a unit that might not be built for two or three years.
"The old model was pre-sales. But in a falling market, it's hard to get people to commit.
"We have to find another way to land developments than that," Mr. Poettcker said.
Developers may have to put in more of their own equity, something they had moved away from doing, or find interim financing while they are building.
"We have developers who are very well financed and who are ready to move ahead," he said.
Like many in the development industry, he believes B.C.'s real-estate market is fundamentally healthy. There isn't a lot of extra inventory and the economy is relatively healthy.
"The vast majority of us still have jobs," Mr. Poettcker said.
"There are a lot of people who are on the sidelines right now. They have down payments and they're waiting. As soon as they sense the prices are right they're going to step up."

Full text: Weak economy, changing consumer habits and online competition brew perfect storm for media companies
When John Temple was delivering copies of The Province to homes in his Vancouver neighbourhood during the 1960s, he thought the newspaper business would go on forever.
Now Mr. Temple, the editor and publisher of Denver's Rocky Mountain News, isn't so sure.
The "Rocky" published its last edition yesterday, marking the end of a 150-year-old institution that got its start covering the Civil War and won four Pulitzer Prizes in the past decade. The owner, E.W. Scripps Co., put the paper up for sale a couple of months ago, and when no buyer emerged, the company closed it down.
Yesterday, as he headed to the newsroom to watch 215 staffers clear out their desks, Mr. Temple said many were in tears, some were angry and others simply numb. "I think it will take a while to absorb the loss and what it means," he said.
Mr. Temple has been a reporter or editor for more than 20 years, in Denver, Toronto and New Mexico, and he has never seen the newspaper industry in such bad shape.
"We're in a period of sort of wrenching destruction," he said. "We're going to see the collapse of many newspapers."
A weak economy, changing consumer habits and competition from the Internet have brought several media companies to their knees. This week alone the owners of three large U.S. newspapers, including the Philadelphia Inquirer, filed for bankruptcy protection; CTV announced plans to close two television stations in Ontario; Canwest Global Communications Corp., owners of the Global TV network, faced a deadline by its lenders and won a two-week reprieve; and Torstar Corp. announced a $211-million quarterly loss and shook up its management ranks.
All that as the owners of several other large U.S. newspapers, including the Chicago Tribune and Los Angeles Times, are already in bankruptcy protection, Canwest has said it may close stations in five cities, and media outlets everywhere - including The Globe and Mail, which is owned by CTVglobemedia - have laid off staff.
The situation is so dire, CTV recently offered its station in Brandon to public broadcaster CBC for $1. The CBC declined.
"I think that we have reached a crisis mode," said Don Mumford, a regional CTV manager who runs the station in London as well as the two that are set to close in Windsor and Wingham, Ont. All three are part of CTV's "A" channel network that also includes stations in Victoria, Ottawa and Barrie, Ont.
"I never thought that I would be in a position where I was closing TV stations," said Mr. Mumford, a 30-year veteran of the TV business.
He said that during the 1960s and 1970s, owning a local TV station was a licence to print money. There were few competitors, fewer distractions and profits poured in.
"In London there was only one TV station, CFPL, and the only other stations that would penetrate into the market would be CKCO in Kitchener, and that's it," he said.
Things began to change in the early 1980s with the advent of cable TV, which brought new channels. As cable grew and other stations began to penetrate the market, the London station began to struggle financially, as did the others. "I can tell you that since about 1990, for sure since 1997, these three stations have not made a profit," he said.
The stations survived because the owner, Baton Broadcasting and later CTV, was still making money from its stations in Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal, and could afford to subsidize the smaller ones. All that has changed. "What you're seeing in the last five years is revenue and audiences now being eroded for all TV stations, including Toronto and Vancouver and Montreal," he said.
In fact, CTV told the federal broadcast regulator yesterday that it expects to lose $100-million from its conventional TV stations in 2009. And in a memo to employees yesterday, CTV Chief Executive Officer Ivan Fecan said all the "A" channels are facing a "grave" situation.
"When we bought the A's, they had never made money. We hoped to turn this around and this year achieved a major increase in their ratings. Despite this, the A's will continue to lose money," Mr. Fecan said. "It is because the business model for conventional television is now broken."
Long-time Wingham TV anchor Bryan Allen fears the departure of the local station may barely cause a ripple in town.
"The closing of the signal here, the shutting down of the transmitter, is really procedural because for all intents and purposes, [the station] hasn't existed since the early 90s really."
Mr. Allen now hosts a local AM radio show in town. When he threw the lines open to callers to discuss the shutdown this week, there were no takers. "Old timers realize this is really the end now," he said. "But it will hardly be noticed."
He remembers a time when the town, with a large broadcasting operation serving a population of about 3,000, boasted it was a radio and television capital of Canada. "There used to be a sign at the edge of town stating that," he said. "Those signs have been taken down a number of years ago."
Mr. Fecan and others in the industry say the only solution is to give networks the ability to add fees to customer cable bills just like specialty channels do, such as TSN or Bravo.
However, the industry's proposal to charge 50 cents a month has been turned down twice by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission, which has said the networks haven't made a strong enough case.
Mr. Temple paints a similar picture of decline in Denver, where the Rocky and its crosstown rival, the Denver Post, once sold more than 1.1 million copies combined on a Sunday. By 2001, the papers had to join forces to cope with flagging financials and formed a joint company to run their business operations while keeping the newsrooms separate. But that didn't stop the bleeding.
Weekday circulation for both papers sunk to 210,000 from 300,000 and the Sunday circulation fell to 600,000. As the economy sank last year, advertisers cut back or shifted their spending, resulting in a $100-million drop in help wanted and real estate ads. Last year the Rocky lost $16-million and in December, Scripps put it up for sale.
"We knew that closure was the most likely option and that it was a very real possibility," Mr. Temple said. "It's a very complicated business situation and it's just not an attractive situation for a buyer to get involved with."
The Rocky may not be the only paper to shut down. Hearst Corp. has said it will close the San Francisco Chronicle unless major budget cuts are imposed or a buyer is found. The company is also prepared to close the Seattle Post-Intelligencer if it can't be sold.
Mr. Temple said newspapers must radically transform how they do business if they hope to survive. They may have to sell stories online much like iTunes, where readers pay a small monthly fee and receive only stories on topics that interest them. And they have to break down old barriers between editorial and advertising departments and get both to work together. "We're still stuck in 'well that's not how we do things.' Sorry, that ain't going to cut it any more if you want to survive," he said.
Local ownership might also be a solution, according to some workers at CHCH in Hamilton, one of the stations Canwest has put up for sale.
A group of employees, including news anchor Donna Skelly, are trying to cobble together a plan to buy the station. The proposal, which is still being formulated and will be taken to the CRTC and to Canwest in the coming weeks, would see the station operated as a local news and variety station, stripping out all of the U.S. programming that makes up prime time.
Ms. Skelly said the city needs to keep the station to retain a local identity. She fears the demise of the station will see stories go unreported, like the 2006 case of a Hamilton man who had been waiting a year to have a piece of his skull reattached. After David Malleau's story was told on TV, he was able to get into the hospital for surgery.
The proposal is based on operating the station much like the CFL's Saskatchewan Roughriders, which are community-owned. The CHCH group is meeting with the team's executives in the coming weeks to discuss how that model could be adapted.
"Why not come up with a radical model, and not have to generate a massive profit, simply cover our costs," Ms. Skelly said. "It is radical, but it's better than what is there now."
She believes a local TV station could be operated on a smaller budget, if the operations don't have to devote heavy resources to buying rights to the top-rated shows out of Hollywood. The proposal has been met with a groundswell of support from the community, Ms. Skelly said.
"We would still produce great news and quality news, but do it within a realistic budget ... It could be the new model for local television," Ms. Skelly said. "Stakeholders in the community would sit on the board and we would report back to them."
Like Ms. Skelly, Mr. Temple believes communities need strong news organizations. "There's got to be a place for stories and local storytelling. People have a hunger for it and I believe we'll figure it out."
When asked what he plans to do now that the Rocky is closed, Mr. Temple replied: "I have no idea. I want to stay in journalism, but I just don't know what kinds of possibilities are open to a person like me."
CHAPTER 11 CLUB

Full text:   3000 LAKE SHORE BLVD. W., UNIT 2
ASKING PRICE: $384,900
SELLING PRICE: $379,900
TAXES: $2,371 (2008)
DAYS ON THE MARKET: eight
LISTING AGENTS: Irene Kaushansky and Philip Brown, Keller Williams Advantage Realty
Irene Kaushansky and Philip Brown distributed thousands of flyers and bought several ads in local papers to give this townhouse the extra exposure it needed to seal a deal within a matter of days.
In the complex at the time there were at least five or six units that had been lingering on the market for close to three months, says Ms. Kaushansky. "And we sold first."
Built in 2003, the three-storey unit is the largest model available in the building, with a roughly 1,600 square foot plan, including two bedrooms and three bathrooms, plus direct access to a double garage.
"It was really good value for the money," says Ms. Kaushansky. "You were able to move right in without doing anything."
The previous owners frequently entertained guests on the ground floor where there is a powder room and carpeted dining room that could be used as an office or third bedroom.
On the second level, hardwood floors in the open principal room stop short of the ceramic in the eat-in kitchen. The kitchen is outfitted with stainless steel appliances, a breakfast bar and a walkout to the deck.
On the top level, the second bedroom has a walk-in closet, and the master suite contains a wall-to-wall closet and access to one of two full bathrooms.
The monthly condo fee is $178.

Full text:   How tall is too tall when it comes to new condominiums? Just how far can we push intensification by expanding upward instead of outward? If an 80-storey condo at Yonge Street and Bloor Street is dandy, then how about at Avenue Road and Bloor Street?
Those questions frame a three-sided wrestling match over the future of the existing Four Seasons Hotel at Avenue Road and Yorkville Avenue. Menkes Developments wants to tear down the 23-storey hotel and in its place build twin towers - one 44 storeys and the other 48 storeys.
Local residents, businesses and groups with an interest in architecture and historic preservation are vocal in their opposition. They raise objections ranging from the shadows the towers will throw on nearby streets, through the disruption construction and later occupation by residents will create, to how the towers will detract from the view of Queen's Park looking north along University Avenue.
In the middle, trying to find a solution, is city planner Louis Tinker.
"What we want to do is achieve the city's overall goals in areas such as intensification but not at the expense of all other factors such as quality of life and the potential impact on the neighbours," he says.
Developers facing opposition from various special interest groups is nothing new. Not in my backyard continues to be the rallying cry when it comes to many projects, especially those affecting long-established neighbourhoods. This one, however, seems to be almost in a class by itself.
The tale starts in 1969 when the Four Seasons was built. At the time, nothing in the area was supposed to rise above the seven-storey Hazelton Lanes immediately to the north. In fact, the official plan still calls for height restrictions of just 46 metres at Bloor Street and Avenue Road and 18 metres on Yorkville Avenue.
City council, however, granted an exemption to the hotel for reasons of economic development. Since then, a number of other high-rises have sprung up nearby but none higher than 23 storeys.
About four years ago, Kingdom Properties, which owned the existing hotel, put it on the auction block. Menkes had bid on it but lost out to a third party. When that buyer did not go ahead with its plans for the site, Menkes stepped in, bought the hotel and hired Peter Clewes of architectsAlliance to design a showstopper of a luxury hotel-condo project.
And that he did: Two slim towers rising from a three-level podium occupying a chunk of land that runs from Cumberland Street to Yorkville Avenue. Set just 12 metres apart, the towers would soar 178.5 metres at their tallest point and represent coverage of 16.85 times the surface of the site, about double the 8.7 times coverage the zoning currently calls for.
When the plans were unveiled, the criticism started. While there were good reasons to voice objections over things such as the shadow the towers would cast over nearby streets from just after 9 a.m. until just after 11.30 a.m. and whether towers of that height were appropriate in an area where the tallest neighbour barely reached half as high, the one that received the most attention was the impact the towers might have on the view of Queen's Park.
"It comes down to what kind of city we want to have," says Catherine Nasmith, an architect, president of the Architectural Conservancy of Ontario and editor of a fortnightly newsletter called Built Heritage News. Her concern is that those towers will stick up like a sore thumb over the east wing of Queen's Park and destroy the serenity and visual sense of balance: They would be a kind of view pollution to a historic vista.
"Look at Ottawa. Both views of Parliament Hill, from the Ontario and Quebec sides, are protected," she says. "We should do the same thing for Queen's Park. Just because we can build something does not mean we should."
The upshot is that after five deputations spoke at a Feb. 9 meeting of the Toronto and East York Community Council meeting - a subcommittee of city council, which rules on and makes recommendations about development in those former cities - Mr. Tinker tabled a report on the project. The councillors voted to let Mr. Tinker go back to Menkes and see if the project could be reshaped in ways to overcome what his report saw as deficiencies.
Mr. Tinker says Mr. Clewes has indeed worked on two alternatives for the site. Mr. Clewes says he is perfectly happy to work to overcome objections but the final word must come from his client, Menkes.
"The subcommittee passed the planning report but the attitude at the meeting was very negative to the whole project," he says. "Nobody really wanted to hear what we could do."
Mr. Tinker, however, reflects sunny good humour. "It's a challenge," he says. "Frankly, I am excited about working on this project. We will be helping decide how high is too high and how dense is too dense."

Full text:   Councillors assailing Miller appointments missed the point - again
The cross-eyed coon dogs of city council reliably barked up the wrong tree this week as they followed the scent of Chicago-style patronage in the increasingly Chicago-style government of Toronto Mayor David Miller. Their big catch was noting that five out of the 12 citizens appointed to Invest Toronto, a new agency with a vague mandate to promote the city, had made contributions to the mayor's 2006 re-election campaign.
Duly noted, but so what? None of the 12 is being paid, and the board has no particular authority or spending power.
It is an open opportunity for engaged citizens who want to make a difference, which is the same group most likely to make political donations.
Twelve out of 12 on that board would barely be news. In the annals of municipal patronage, five is lily white.
The real news is that there is not one identifiable Miller supporter or contributor among the eight real-estate professionals who were appointed this week to the board of Build Toronto, another new agency, but one with a specific mandate and the powers to match.
One is a talk shop filled with politicos. The other is chop shop filled with non-aligned technicians focused on a single task: turning the city's extensive land holdings into free-flowing cash. With its own revenue, beginning with rents from an initial grant of 30 city-owned properties, Build Toronto is custom-designed to bulldoze political resistance to suburban intensification.
Public land outside the core has laid fallow for too long because local politicians prefer parking lots to apartment buildings, according to Councillor Kyle Rae, a pro-development downtowner also appointed to Build Toronto's developer-dominated board.
Each year, Mr. Rae said, he and two fellow downtown councillors, Pam McConnell and Adam Vaughan, help to add $40-million to the city tax base by expediting approvals for development in their wards. In his view, Build Toronto is the big stick that will swing the same kind of deals in the NIMBY suburbs.
Michael Walker's worst nightmare?
"Exactly!" Mr. Rae enthused.
Give Councillor Walker credit for recognizing the threat as his witless colleagues assailed the blameless appointees to Invest Toronto.
The record of Build Toronto's founding now includes an official reply to a series of written questions posed by Councillor Walker to determine the extent of the agency's powers.
Taken as a whole, they succinctly confirm his suspicion that it will be largely immune from council control.
The board is staffed accordingly, beginning with vice-chair Blake Hutcheson, who cut his political teeth as chair of the influential blue-ribbon panel that first recommended the city "monetize" its scattered and disorganized real-estate portfolio. Apart from one token union rep and triple-token Brigitte Shim (architect, female, visible minority), the rest are white, middle-aged developers just like Mr. Hutcheson.
The mayor played a lead role in picking both boards, according to Councillor Rae, who sits on both in his capacity as chair of the city's economic development committee.
With Build Toronto, he said, the aim was to draw directly on top private-sector expertise - and to pay for it. Unlike the appointees to the board of fuzzy Invest Toronto, those appointed to Build Toronto will be paid $500 a meeting, the vice-chair twice that.
One of the two new agencies is a pure patronage play, innocent in its transparency and, indeed, potentially helpful in some sunny future.
But the one that matters now is all business, as the baying hounds will soon discover.

Full text:   Early sales effort helped launch CFTO, later he was key innovator
The career of Ted Delaney, CFTO's original sales manager, mirrored the rise of private Canadian broadcasting and the CTV network.
CFTO became Toronto's first private station when it went on the air on Dec. 31, 1960. But that was preceded by a battle over who would own its licence. Some of the applicants for what was seen as the richest prize in Canadian broadcasting included The Toronto Star, Canadian media mogul Jack Kent Cooke and Britain's Granada Television.
The winner was Baton Broadcasting, owned by the Bassett and Eaton families. Their partners included Ted Rogers and the licence application's front man, Joel Aldred, a Canadian radio and TV announcer. Mr. Aldred sold his holdings in the first year, worried that the station was struggling.
Mr. Delaney came to the rescue. He had valuable experience in television sales, having worked at CHCH in Hamilton, Canada's first private TV station. He was tireless in beating down doors to sell commercials, then an unusual commodity in an advertising world hooked on print and radio.
"Ted used to joke that he had been thrown out of more places than most salesmen had visited," said Ted Stuebing, a former vice-president of news at CFTO. "He was, in my opinion, responsible for the early success of CFTO because he worked so hard to sell the station."
Ted Delaney was born in Ottawa, the son of Irish immigrants, but the family moved to Barrie, Ont., when he was young. His father took care of a large estate on Lake Simcoe owned by a British family who spent summers there.
After high school, Mr. Delaney sold cars, then got a job in broadcast sales. He worked at a Barrie radio station and local TV station CKVR. He graduated to the larger market at CHCH before joining CFTO as sales manager.
In 1966, when Murray Chercover left as CFTO's vice-president of programming to become executive vice-president of CTV, Mr. Delaney added that title to his own.
That was the same year that the Board of Broadcast Governors - the forerunner of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission - agreed that the CTV affiliates could buy the network. CTV carried 64 hours a week of programming and CFTO produced the bulk of its Canadian content.
As head of programming for CFTO, Mr. Delaney was involved in many major decisions, including buying the first colour TV cameras at a private station. That was three months before the official launch of colour television in Canada on Sept. 1, 1966.
He also spearheaded the expansion of production facilities at CFTO through the station's subsidiary, Glen Warren Productions. By 1977, it was, according to the Canadian Communications Foundation, the third-largest TV production facility in the world, with 400 full-time employees.
"In addition to producing many programs for CTV, CFTO now became an attractive option for U.S. producers wanting to create product for the 7-8 prime access time period, which could no longer be programmed by the U.S. networks," Bill Dulmage wrote in the history section of the Canadian Communications Foundation website.
"Over the next few years, the series which were crafted to qualify as Canadian content so they could play on CTV stations included The Barbara McNair Show , The Ray Stevens Show (a summer replacement for The Andy Williams Show on NBC), Rollin' On The River and half The George Kirby Comedy Hour ."
The ratings at CFTO made the station the richest broadcast property in Canada. When "people meters" were introduced in the late 1980s, Mr. Delaney was over the moon that on one of the first nights the audience was accurately measured, the station had a 37-per-cent share of Toronto viewers.
For decades, Mr. Delaney and another CFTO executive, Larry Nichols, were responsible for the day-to-day running of the station, according to a colleague who worked with them. Mr. Delaney also worked on many side projects, including organizing an annual telethon for the Hospital for Sick Children.
One of the key programming areas was local news. Among other things, it was classified as Canadian content, as well as being a money-maker. Although other people ran the news operation, Mr. Delaney was behind many of the strategic decisions, including making it the first Toronto television station to offer an evening newscast seven days a week. CFTO's local newscast is still the leader in the Toronto market.
In 1988, Mr. Delaney and CFTO were involved in a real-life drama. By this time, he was executive vice-president of the station, the highest non-family member in the organization still owned by the Eatons and Bassetts. There was a bitter 12-week lockout at CFTO, and when it was over about a third of the striking technicians took a buyout package.
Mr. Delaney retired from CFTO in the early 1990s.
EDWARD JOSEPH DELANEY
Edward Joseph Delaney was born in Ottawa on Aug. 29, 1931. He died of cancer at Unionville, Ont., on Feb. 17, 2009. He leaves his wife, Joan, his children, Sandra, Sheila, Sean and Sharon, and his sisters, Peg and Eileen.

Full text:   One mustn't dwell on the negative in these hard times. No less an authority than Dr. Phil himself warns of the health risks attached to stinkin' thinkin' and regularly tells viewers of his daytime talk show to get outside for a walk now and then.
Dr. Phil also suggests people take pleasure in the small things in life, like watching Dr. Phil, or any other TV program that might provide a fleeting hour of escapist entertainment. More sound medical advice, but there's little regard for the easily depressed in tonight's TV lineup. Most of what airs on Wednesday night is only going to make you feel worse. Like Wednesday's child, the hump-night schedule is full of woe. Midweek prime time is the zone of the network crime drama, with Life (NBC, 9 p.m.) the better than usual suspect.
Life is a decent cop show, driven by British actor Damian Lewis's portrayal of Charlie Crews, a police detective once framed and sent to prison, then made a millionaire in compensation for being wrongly convicted. Like every other network cop show, Life is also relentlessly grim.
Tonight, Crews and his new partner (Brent Sexton) are called to a grisly crime scene: the murder by impalement of a ladies man with an abiding affection for pigeons. Don't ask. The investigation leads into the world of low-rent contract killers.
Over on the still highly rated Criminal Minds (CBS, 9 p.m.), the profiler team tracks another contract killer, this one a sexy lady who poses as a call girl to knock off executives. Bodies are turning up in hotel rooms all over the city.
Further police-procedural unpleasantries unfolds on CSI:NY (CBS, CTV, 10 p.m.) - the CSI team try to reunite a human eyeball with its owner - and on Law & Order (NBC, A, 10 p.m.), which has a story about a stockbroker who dies after a bad lunch - a pretty obvious attempt to cheer up viewers.
The only thing more depressing than the cop shows on Wednesday night is the ongoing chronicle of Lost (ABC, CTV, 9 p.m.), still growing its own mythology as it draws to a close. Does anyone know or care about what's happening on Lost any more? Tonight's show is a Locke episode, so enjoy if you're still paying attention.
It's perhaps wiser these days to find a program that will take your mind completely off world events, or your own dwindling stock portfolio. Colour me sheepish, but lately I'm more drawn to the easy viewing of MuchMoreMusic.
Besides being the only Canadian showcase for wonderfully awful eighties music -Everybody Wang Chung Tonight! - the channel has several fine original series, most notably Where You At, Baby? (MuchMoreMusic, 8 p.m.).
Host Matt Wells displays proper fan respect toward once-famous pop icons. He has hung out with Vanilla Ice, fly-fished with Huey Lewis and shopped for produce with ex-Loverboy front man Mike Reno (who appears not to have missed any meals since hanging up his headband). Tonight, Wells catches up with Dee Snider, former lead singer of the eighties metal group Twisted Sister. He's still got it.
Yet more entertaining is Confessions of a Pop Idol (MuchMoreMusic, 9 p.m.). Duplicating the style of other VH-1 reality shows such as Celebrity Rehab and its spinoff Sober House , the concept brings together former teen male heartthrobs -including The Blue Lagoon star Christopher Atkins, Dance Fever host Adrian Zmed and Brian Austin Green, who played Tori Spelling's boyfriend on Beverly Hills, 90210 - and houses them together in a Los Angeles mansion.
The pretense is that the show is part of a comeback for the faded stars, most of whom have some hard miles on them. The show fairly drips pathos, but how much empathy can you have for a former Baywatch lifeguard?
Tonight, the aging man-hunks are marched through a popular paparazzi zone - of course, none of the photographers knows who they are - followed by a career pep talk from Scott Baio, better known as Chachi from Happy Days . Later, there's a test of their thespian skills in a community-theatre production for underprivileged kids. Work is work, as they say.
For some people, the guiltiest pleasure is found in the lurid tales of True Hollywood Story (E!, 10 p.m.). Still dishing dirt in its second decade, the tabloid-style E! series tonight airs a new profile of Donald Trump, the real-estate tycoon whose TV fame continues to inexplicably expand, courtesy of The Celebrity Apprentice .
Unlike most True Hollywood episodes, this is a Trump-sanctioned profile, which becomes rather evident in his opening statement: "I'm the most well-known person in the world!" - according to recent polls, he claims.
Trump's heavy hand is all over the tale, which brushes by his upbringing and digs up old feuds with Rosie O'Donnell and Martha Stewart. Borrowing everyone else's Trump punchline, he now makes his own jokes about his infamous hair-helmet.
The program touches sparingly on his various marriages and personal life, but in a rare show of candour, The Donald admits that he has, on occasion, made some very bad business mistakes that cost him millions of dollars.
Now, don't you feel a little better?

Also airing tonight
The Week the Women Went (CBC, 8 p.m.) sallies forth, in a way, as one of CBC's top-rated shows. Holding weekly in the 750,000-viewer range, the reality series explained entirely in its title skews strongly to a female audience; clearly there are women out there who enjoy watching men look like big dumb oafs. The Homer Simpson scenarios continue in tonight's sixth chapter of the TV experiment filmed in the small Nova Scotian town of Tatamagouche last year. No women, gotta do the work, eh? One man panics when he runs out of clean dishes. A sluggard father has unruly kids and goats running around the house. In a Jerry Springer-type twist, one of the abandoned men misses his lady fair and mother of his children so much, he contemplates asking her to marry him, on their eight-year anniversary. Ain't love grand?
America's Ballroom
Challenge (PBS, 9 p.m.) is the flip side of Dancing with the Stars , which incidentally returns on March 9. The PBS documentary was filmed at the world's biggest ballroom-dancing competition in Columbus, Ohio. The annual event attracts thousands of dancers from teens to seniors. The winning couples in each division come together for one grand finale dance-off for the title of America's Best Ballroom Couple. No massive cash prizes or celebrity hoofers here, just lovely ballroom dancing. A.R.

Full text:   In a snow-swept field northeast of Edmonton, a slender green smokestack rises like an impudent finger gesturing rudely at the economic carnage around it.
The stack is surrounded by industrial debris, including big tube-like steel vessels that cost more than $5-million apiece. The clutter suggests the scene at a messy apartment where the occupant got an unexpected phone call to vacate in a hurry.
This is the would-be home of a massive bitumen upgrading project, which, after a $530-million investment in land, equipment and technology, now lies abandoned by all but security guards. Its corporate owner, BA Energy, is in bankruptcy protection.
The site and the surrounding fields are where Upgrader Alley, a hotly anticipated $80-billion complex of oil sands processing and related industry, has hit its physical and symbolic dead end.
Of all the Alberta victims of the energy price implosion, the retreat from Upgrader Alley is the most crippling for the province and the country. Fort McMurray will continue to churn out raw bitumen from its mines and steam-fed underground wells, but the upgrader boom around Fort Saskatchewan, a half hour from Edmonton, cannot go ahead under the current economics.
It is a blow to countless dreams, not only in the 533-square-kilometre Fort Saskatchewan industrial complex but also the counties around it - an area that, even before the upgraders, had been branded Alberta's Industrial Heartland. It will be a crushing setback to Edmonton and its manufacturing complex of Nisku, south of the provincial capital, where a lot of the fabrication would have taken place.
Above all, it will dash Alberta's hopes of being not only the grubby mine site for oil sands extraction, but a value-added centre for upgrading raw bitumen into synthetic crude oil - and possibly a petrochemical cluster built around the byproducts of the process. The province's long-running pursuit of industrial diversification is once again on hold.
The hope was that the Heartland would upgrade two million barrels of bitumen a day. Now, there are fears that the action will shift south, as new and existing upgraders on the Gulf Coast or the U.S. Midwest suck away the lion's share of that new processing.
"That would be a horrible thing for the province," says Debbie Hamilton, chief administrative officer for the town of Redwater, a village of 2,100 that has dreams of becoming a bedroom community for the upgraders. "It's like raping our natural resources."
Upgrader Alley would have come with a huge environmental price. The Pembina Institute, an environmental research group, estimates that, with all plants operating under original projections, the upgraders would have generated as many greenhouse gas emissions as 10 million vehicles - and consume 10 times as much water as the City of Edmonton.
Those kinds of numbers will buttress the anti-oil-sands sentiment in the administration of U.S. President Barack Obama. But Alberta could also argue that if separate upgraders are now built in, say, Fort Saskatchewan, Omaha and Chicago, the total environmental footprint is much bigger because these are one-off investments. In Upgrader Alley, producers could cluster for efficiencies in areas like carbon capture and water use.
"I think that kind of logic would be something Canada and Alberta would want to discuss with the new U.S. administration," says Joseph Doucet, a professor of energy policy at the University of Alberta.
Officially, there are still plans to build or expand eight upgraders in the region, which already boasts about 20 hydrocarbon processing plants and refineries.
But in reality, only one new project is a sure thing - a large expansion of Shell Canada Ltd.'s upgrader on its Scotford refinery site, where construction is now under way a little more than a kilometre away from BA Energy's abandoned operation.
All the others are under review or delayed, including the massive $10-billion project to be built by Petro-Canada and its partners; sites owned by foreign players Total SA (France) and StatoilHydro ASA (Norway); and independent "merchant" operations such as North West Upgrading Inc. and BA Energy itself.
The projects would have drawn an estimated 22,000 construction workers to the area by 2012, and as many as 12,000 permanent jobs. Now, when 4,000 workers wind up their building jobs at Scotford over the next two years, there is no assurance they will find a place to work locally. (Shell has 1,000 permanent workers on the site.) "A year ago, the big problem was, where will we find workers?" says Neil Shelly, executive director of the Alberta Industrial Heartland, a coalition of municipalities. "Today, we're switching to: How do you find work for these people?"
The shifting economics has choked off a local land boom, which Mr. Shelly calls "the Gold Rush of 2005 to 2007" - the period when, it seemed, every Fort McMurray operator was nailing down land positions here - even if they didn't have a project in mind. "It was like a tulip market back then," he laughs.
The land grab fired entrepreneurial plans in housing, services and hospitality. But now the noon-hour crowds are dwindling even at the Atlantic Kitchen fish and chips restaurant a couple of blocks away from the constituency office of the local MLA, Premier Ed Stelmach.
"I'm a little bit worried now," says Agnes Street, the restaurant's owner who relocated to Alberta from Newfoundland 13 years ago. The movement of her fellow Newfoundlanders is always a sure barometer of the state of Alberta's economy, and now, she says, the exodus is all back home.
Inside the halls of Alberta's legislature, there remains a keen optimism that the Heartland is not dead, but asleep.
"We hope soon to see a turnaround," said Finance Minister Iris Evans. "We're optimistic that [shelved upgraders] will go ahead. The opportunity to develop our petrochemical and refining industries is part of a very great advantage of Alberta's future." Upgrader Alley has been a victim of the oil price as it has tumbled from $147 (U.S.) a barrel to below $40 in less than eight months. But the writing was on the wall at least a year before the meltdown, as operators were scared off by soaring costs of construction and processing in Alberta. Upgrader Alley is as much a casualty of the Alberta boom as its subsequent bust.
The industry hates the term "tar sands," but Mr. Shelly says it is entirely appropriate to describe bitumen from Fort McMurray - the stuff has the consistency of road tar on a hot summer day.
For it to be refinery-ready, it needs to be upgraded into synthetic crude, which means applying extreme pressure and heat to the gooey substance to separate coke, sulphur and other byproducts. At the moment, close to 70 per cent of the upgrading is done in Canada. Most of that work is done in Fort McMurray, but that area, with already massive mines and upgraders, faces huge cost and logistical challenges for future upgraders. So the idea was to dilute the bitumen and pipe it 400 kilometres to Fort Saskatchewan.
Fort Saskatchewan (pop. 17,000) is one of those places that garners dramatically different responses - a chemical engineer's dream, but an environmentalist's nightmare. Since the 1950s, energy processors have been drawn to this rolling farmland and bush along the North Saskatchewan River. It's near the hub of major pipelines; both major railways have lines running close to the site. While Fort Mac is isolated and hardscrabble, Fort Saskatchewan is almost a suburb of Edmonton with its amenities and urban lifestyle.
What's more, the area is blessed with huge salt caverns beneath the surface. When water is added and the salt solution flushed out, you have millions of cubic feet in storage capacity for natural gas and gas liquids. In addition, you have a ready supply of water from the North Saskatchewan.
The result is the largest hydrocarbon processing facility in Canada, home to operations of Dow Chemical, Sherritt International, Nova Chemicals and Agrium Inc., among others. The Industrial Heartland park boasts 3,500 direct jobs, but the number doubles in indirect employment.
According to Mr. Shelly, the potential to pipe in bitumen would have taken the Heartland to a new level of adding value. He paints a vision of using byproducts, such as petroleum coke, to fire up a chemical cluster patterned after industrial complexes in Europe, such as in Marl, Germany.
But in the crazy world of gyrating energy prices, the perverse economics of the oil sands took hold. First, there is the plunge in oil prices, which combined with the still lofty costs of labour and construction, put projects in peril.
But the killing blow was the arcane pricing of bitumen, which has raised doubts about the economics of upgrading the tarry oil in Canada. The idea behind Canadian upgraders was to capture the differential in price between raw bitumen and the more expensive synthetic crude that is produced through upgrading.
Under normal circumstances, that gap amounts to about 40 per cent of the price of West Texas intermediate crude, but in the past year it was narrowed to about 20 per cent.
The price of bitumen is set in the U.S. South and Midwest. In the past, upgraders in the region took a lot of their heavy oil from Venezuela and Mexico. But for reasons of politics and declining investment, those sources are in decline, and the U.S. players are looking north for supply. That demand is raising the price of raw Canadian bitumen and reducing the price differential sharply with upgraded crude.
As the gap narrows, it becomes more efficient to fill upgrading capacity in the U.S. - or to bolt an upgrader on to an existing refinery - instead of adding an expensive greenfield project in Fort Saskatchewan. The narrowing margins, combined with high construction costs, outweigh the expense of piping diluted bitumen from Fort McMurray to Galveston or Chicago.
Yet, amid the downturn, there is also a recognition that Upgrader Alley may not live up to its early billing.
"It was never clear that all of [the upgraders] were going to go ahead," provincial energy spokesman Jason Chance said. "We're confident that many of those projects will come back. But there's a mistaken assumption that there are no benefits to the province if we sell our bitumen to other jurisdictions. What we know and believe is that the best value for Albertans comes in selling a whole range of products ... If it's all about one product, and an upgraded product, you're putting all of your eggs in one basket and we're not interested in seeing that happen."
One great hope for the Heartland area is that the Alberta government uses more of its muscle to get upgrading done in Alberta. Particularly promising is a commitment to receive royalties from the oils sands in the form of actual bitumen - royalty-in-kind - instead of cash. Under this scenario, Alberta would use its bitumen supply to force-feed at least one new upgrader in the area. And if you build one, more will presumably follow.
"With bitumen in kind, you may have product for at least one large upgrader right there," says Prof. Doucet, the University of Alberta energy specialist. Once that upgrader is a sure thing, the province could assemble infrastructure in Fort Saskatchewan to pool resources - water, steam, electricity, even space - among several plants. The economies of scale could be significant. "If you do it effectively, that should get you lower fixed costs per barrel," he says.
The government repeated its commitment to a bitumen royalty in its oil sands development plan released last week and hopes to make a decision in "the next several weeks" on whether to begin soliciting companies for proposals, Mr. Chance said. That may be the best hope for BA Energy, which ran out of money last year, shut down its site and filed for bankruptcy protection. The story is poignant because BA is the brainchild of Columba Yeung, an entrepreneurial maverick in an otherwise Big Oil environment. Mr. Yeung was born in Hong Kong to a Catholic family - hence, the name Columba, an Irish saint. Trained in Canada as an engineer, he was once a key manager for Shell Canada, and was instrumental in designing the Scotford refinery.
Mr. Yeung, who controls BA's parent, Value Creation Inc., is an engineering genius who developed a unique technologythat he touts as a more energy-efficient and productive way of turning bitumen into synthetic crude. But he ran into the global credit crunch, and, as an independent, lacks ready cash. He did not return a phone call for this article, but court documents have indicated BA is in talks with a large global company.
Whatever the outcome, it puts a serious crimp in his dreams of being a player in the Alberta oil patch. Still, he owns a big piece of real estate in the oil sands northwest of Fort McMurray. To succeed in the bitumen business, "you have to have a lot of dirt," he said two years ago.
BA Energy has a lot of land and some of it may be bitumen-rich dirt. But what is missing now, as all the oil sands players have discovered, is capital and a profitable business model.
Albertans should have known that not everything on the drawing board would get done in Upgrader Alley. Now with just one project in the works, they are hoping something, anything, gets done.

Who's who in Upgrader Alley
SHELL CANADA
The only sure thing in the Alley. The phase-one expansion of the upgrader on its Scotford project is under way, with a target completion in 2010-11. However, the next stage of upgrader expansion is being delayed for now. Shell, which first invested in the oil sands in 1956, sees this as a mere blip in a long-term strategy.
PETRO-CANADA
Along with partners Teck Cominco and UTS, Petrocan had planned to build a $10-billion upgrader to handle bitumen from its Fort Hills mining project north of Fort McMurray. But Petrocan faces a number of challenges, including costs and uncertainty around its partners. It has delayed the Fort Hills mine project pending a review this year. But it indicates that the economics of the supply source remains the main priority. Meanwhile, the upgrader has moved lower on the list of must-do things.

The French oil giant has become involved in two potential upgrader projects in the area but both are now on hold. Total remains a busy player in the oil sands, recently launching a hostile bit for UTS, Petrocan's Fort Hills partner.
STATOILHYDRO
Norway's national oil company also has an upgrader on the books but last year it pulled the project back for further review.
NORTH WEST UPGRADING
A private company based in Calgary, North West has plans for a $7-billion merchant upgrader that would process bitumen from various sources, rather than tied into a particular supply source. However, construction has been pushed on to the backburner.
BA ENERGY
Private company is in bankruptcy protection, having seen the costs of its upgrader project balloon to more than $4-billion from an estimated $2-billion. Company is scrambling to reorganize and nail down financing.
SUNCOR
Calgary-based giant, which operates two large upgraders at Fort McMurray, halted work on its third, called Voyageur, in January. The company had already completed 70 per cent of engineering and 10 per cent of construction on the project.

"It's charming, it's comfortable, it feels safe ... and you're 15 minutes from downtown," she said. "It's changing now where young families are coming in. They've got great schools there. People are thinking, 'I can get way more house than I can in a little downtown semi-detached.' "

Full text:   The star chef wants to revolutionize the supermarket, and he's chosen the controversial Shops at Don Mills as the place to realize his dream. The decision isn't to some locals' taste, reports Jessica Leeder.
Picture this: You're midway through the daily race home from work, sapped of energy and feeling about as culinarily inspired as Chef Boyardee.
In the old days, you would have outsourced dinner duty to experts in pizza delivery. Instead, you detour out of highway gridlock and nip over to mcewan, a little spot in the heart of Don Mills where the twinned scents of espresso and fresh baked bread rush your nostrils.
The savoury smell of roasts at the hot bar pull you past a sushi counter where the chefs are crafting fresh rolls. You face a quandary: Do you delve into the 50-foot sprawl of prepared offerings, scallion spun potatoes and curry braised short ribs? Or do you move on to the fish and meat counters, weave through the charcuterie and North American cheese, assembling raw ingredients for your dinner, plus a few indulgences - house-jarred foie gras, or luxury Galler chocolates?
You settle on a melange and move to the checkout, where clean-cut young men pack your things into fully biodegradable paper bags, which do not cost extra. While the bag boys carry the load to your trunk, you whisk back into the store to order a latte from a relaxed barista. You revel in the New York-inspired romance of the place, with its fresh flowers and thoughtful displays, then set off for a bistro-quality meal - at home.
Sound like a dream?
It is, and it belongs to Toronto uber-chef Mark McEwan, the architect of some of this city's finest cuisine. The dream is scheduled to come true later this year, around the time spring blooms into summer.
When the chef-turned-businessman cuts the ribbon on his 22,000-square-foot space, it will mark the realization of a vision half-a-dozen years in the making. But for one cadre of community members, the opening of the up-market grocery and its neighbouring niche vendors represents the coming of a nightmare, one in which they've been priced out of a place to shop.
DREAM THE IMPOSSIBLE DREAM
A native of Buffalo, N.Y., Mr. McEwan, 51, has been hiking his way to the pinnacle of chef-dom in Toronto since the late 1970s. After a stint in the early eighties as executive chef at the Sutton Place Hotel, where he cooked for Pope John Paul II, among others, he began assembling the building blocks for a restaurant and catering empire. Anchored by uptown hot spot North 44, it now includes Yorkville restaurant One, the financial district's Bymark and a Food Network series, The Heat .
As the chef's star has risen in this city, so has his grocery-related malaise.
"When you walk in a store today, it's just aisle upon aisle of convenience food. When you go to the fresh section, the tomatoes are lousy and the herbs are lousy and the meat is substandard, and the fish, I can't bring myself to buy. The bread is ... just the same bread everybody else has," he said.
"I don't like to be disparaging about what other people are doing. But I can't find anything that gets me excited."
This is something that does get Mr. McEwan, who says he is never without "a project," excited. "I have been thinking about this forever."
Don Mills 4
Cadillac Fairview's redevelopment of the historic Don Mills Centre presented a unique venue: An open-air hybrid that is part mall, part Main Street, the concept will present elite vendors with enough pull to draw shoppers from all over the city.
After studying the location ("I have many, many maps with circles on them"), Mr. McEwan decided the Shops at Don Mills was perfect for the launch of his $6-million Europe-meets-North America food-retail experiment.
He hired Peter Turcot, a former Loblaw vice-president whom he has dubbed the "grocery guru" of the operation. Together, the pair have developed a strategy that features edible offerings, which will be produced in the second-floor restaurant-style kitchen. They believe this nerve centre will set mcewan far ahead of its competitors in the cut-throat specialty grocery sector.
"There's no expertise in prepared foods at all. That's where everybody really falls down, in having a chef put a pot on the stove and making something worth eating," Mr. McEwan said. He believes that the fresh product, plus his commitment to old-style service and healthy food, will keep clients coming back.
"The basic quality that people eat, from bread to cheese to fish to meat, should be at a higher standard. I'm not saying that you try to go for cult products like Kobe beef or Wagyu beef or things that are ultra-expensive. That's not the concept at all," he said. "You can buy real food. You'll be able to shop here every day."
By his measure, Mr. McEwan will attract neighbourhood residents who will splurge on specialty items, shoppers who live in nearby residential pockets such as the Bridle Path and Rosedale, plus commuters traversing nearby arteries such as Bayview Avenue, Leslie Street, York and Don Mills roads and Highway 401.
"This demographic is massive," he said. "People don't understand how big it is. If you imagine people hopping in their car, which you have to do in Toronto ... it's very convenient for people."
Precisely what Don Mills old-timers are afraid of.
FIGHT FOR THE TOWN SQUARE
The fifties- and sixties-style ranch houses and back splits that ring the winding streets of Don Mills are still filled with many of the original residents, who moved to Canada's first planned community after its construction in 1953, attracted by the contained, small-town feel it offered.
Divided into four quadrants, the 835-hectare neighbourhood was designed to minimize through traffic. Rimmed by industrial zoning on the periphery, the inner residential loops are linked by pedestrian pathways and green space. At the heart of it all, the forefathers of the neighbourhood planned an open-air commercial hub, inspired by the marketplaces of ancient Greece.
"Many people moved here because of this convenience. The mall was the centre of the community," said Simone Gabbay, founder of Don Mills Friends, a community advocacy group that formed in 2006 to lobby against the reformation of the old shopping plaza. "In the summer it was cooling, in the winter it was warming. It served the people who lived here ... it had grown out of the needs for services they had."
By 2001, though, it was becoming evident to plaza owner Cadillac Fairview that the community was poised to outgrow the aging marketplace, which had lost its old department-store anchors and become laden with discount shops.
"The average age of the [mall] consumer was 55, yet the average age of a person in the community was 45," said Anne Morash, vice-president of development for the company. "Basically what we weren't doing was servicing those in the community."
Five years later, the company settled on a plan to restore the shopping plaza to a version of its former self - in its original incarnation, the mall was not fully enclosed - by knocking down the weathered building and replacing it with a new streetscape concept pioneered in middle America.
"It's really meant to be like Bloor West Village, or Bayview and Eglinton ... the only difference being that all the stores are owned by the same landlord," Ms. Morash explained.
In keeping with the community's treatment of the mall as a meeting place, a 60,000-square-foot town square will centre the shops, a mix of service-based businesses and "better-quality retailers, but not necessarily high-end," Ms. Morash said.
The decision to raze the old mall tipped off an uproar in some parts of the community. Ms. Gabbay's group circulated a petition that gained signatures of 5,000 detractors. Their efforts, though, were not enough to save the old mall.
The community's more established residents group, Don Mills Residents Inc., took a different tack. "We basically started working with them to try to improve the plan they put on the table," said Terry West, a 25-year resident and president of the group, which is one of the largest associations of its kind in the city. "They're in the business to make money. You have to acknowledge that."
Mr. West's association was also ready to acknowledge a wave of demographic changes that was beginning to erode Don Mills' aged base. "It's a renaissance taking place, there's no question about it," he said. "Life is changing. We're not living in the fifties and sixties any more."
ROSEDALE OF THE NORTH
Since its creation, Don Mills has strived to maintain a certain heterogeneity: a healthy mix of income levels and a blend of rental apartments and single-family dwellings. But, despite community organizers' efforts, the middle-class population is hollowing out.
From 2001 to 2006, the average household income jumped to $109,000 from $91,000, city figures show, even though there was not a significant amount of new residential development. During that same time, the median household income jumped to $74,000 from $65,000, and there was a nearly 10-per-cent jump in the number of families earning $100,000 or more. (At the other end of the spectrum, there are more people struggling with low incomes, and an overall thinning of those ranked between the two poles.)
If statistics leave any doubts, the foray of Toronto interior designer and television personality Sarah Richardson into the neighbourhood last year should erase them. Ms. Richardson grew up in central Toronto but found herself venturing east of the Don Valley while scouting for a home to purchase and renovate for the second-season instalment of her popular HGTV show, Sarah's House . Once she stripped her Don Mills acquisition - a 1960s back split - of its tired decor, she wound up feeling so cozy there that she held a rare open house for all her neighbours. Onscreen, she declared the transformation one of her all-time favourites.
"To me, it's become the Rosedale of the north up there," said Kara Reed, Ms. Richardson's Chestnut Park real-estate agent. "It's charming, it's comfortable, it feels safe ... and you're 15 minutes from downtown," she said. "It's changing now where young families are coming in. They've got great schools there. People are thinking, 'I can get way more house than I can in a little downtown semi-detached.' "
To a certain degree, Cadillac Fairview and its blue-chip tenants are banking on that. Aside from mcewan, the development, which opens officially on April 22, boasts the North American debut of high-end U.S. clothier Anthropologie, the first non-resort shop for ski and snowboard gear-maker Salomon and the first Ontario outpost of western Canadian bookseller McNally Robinson. Pickle Barrel partner and caterer Rose Reisman has also chosen the location to open her first restaurant, Glow.
While Mr. McEwan is also intent on attracting high-end customers, he's adamant that his store will not cater exclusively to the upper class. "I don't think anybody will find me onerous with cost. I'll be fair," he said. "I don't have five investors screaming down my neck for profit. I don't need to make a nickel in my first year in operation." (Still, the first few years are critical. If things go well, the shop will serve as a model for a mini-chain of up to three more stores.)
The addition of mcewan and other retailers - many of which are now only accessible downtown or in malls on the city's periphery - is predicted to draw not only traffic, but also new families to the area, Mr. West said. He suggests that will intensify as condominiums linked to the development begin to take shape.
Whether the sum of it all will amount to a full facelift in Don Mills remains to be seen. It's something Mr. West's organization is prepared to rally against. "We don't want to become an elite community," he said.
"We want to ensure that we have the butcher, the baker and the candlestick maker."
Mcewan opens at 38 Karl Fraser Rd., mid-spring.

It was completely enclosed and renovated in the late 1970s, so little remained of the original design when Cadillac Fairview decided to demolish the centre and replace it with the Shops at Don Mills, a "lifestyle centre."

Full text:   There is nothing pretentious in his rustic-looking Collingwood home, says contractor Richard Wilson
110 ESCARPMENT VIEW COURT
WHAT: a luxurious custom built all-seasons recreational house on a double lot backing onto Craigleith Provincial Park, and facing the slopes of Alpine Ski Club.
LIVING SPACE: approximately 10,000 square feet, including a 1,200 three-bedroom apartment above a four-bay garage.
LOT SIZE: 1.5 acres
ASKING PRICE: $3.950-million
TAXES: $11,541 (2008)

When it came to building his own house, Richard Wilson at first thought to create a modern-style residence in keeping with his area of expertise.
A sought-after contractor, he works frequently with Hariri Pontarini, the Toronto firm that, with Mr. Wilson's help, created a 2006 modernist residence for an art collector in the Bridle Path that won scores of industry accolades, including a Best of Canada Design Award from Canadian Interiors.
But after choosing a double woodland lot close to his hometown of Collingwood, Ont., the affable founder and president of Toronto-based Wilson Project Management had second thoughts: "I love modern, but I was building at the foot of a mountain, and I began to think that maybe modern wasn't right."
A tree ultimately decided the direction he took in building a craftsman-style residence made from an abundance of natural materials, much of it locally sourced. A surprise gift from wife Laura Wilson, the towering 12-foot sculpture by local artist Gord Kemp is made from a piece of cedar driftwood mounted in a chunk of stone.
Mr. Wilson had long admired the work, seeing it first in a Collingwood-area gallery. Upon becoming its owner, he set about making a house big enough to accommodate it.
But it was a painstaking process. While he purchased the land in 2002, it took two years to draw up the blueprints, and another two years to build his home, the first he was building for himself and family of two boys from scratch.
For about a year, he and his wife regularly came to the property toting fold-up chairs that they'd reposition across the lot to determine how best to site their dream home. But with the slopes of the Alpine Ski Club in front of the property to the south, and forested Craigleith Provincial Park, extending from the shores of Georgian Bay, behind them to the north, figuring out the best views wasn't easy. "They were all great," Mr. Wilson continues. "We had skiers to the front of us, wild turkey and deer to the back."
Ultimately, the decision was to relish it all, with a 10,000 square foot rustic-looking house fitted on all sides with custom mahogany windows framing the great outdoors.
With exterior walls made of energy-efficient insulated concrete forms, the house boasts a traditional chalet façade made from Owen Sound Ledgerock, Cape Cod-style wood siding, Douglas Fir railings, and a cedar roof sporting copper eaves.
Organic materials continue on the inside in the form of radiant heat hemlock floors made of reclaimed wood from old Ontario barns.
The kitchen's open concept design connects it to a grand-scale great room whose focal point is the 28-foot-high wood-burning fireplace carved from Algonquin rubble stone. Overhead, the soaring ceilings are made of Douglas Fir whose 20-inch beams were reclaimed from Toronto's Fleet Street Brewery. The centrepiece supports a gargantuan hanging light fixture made of twigs in keeping with the home's back-to-nature theme.
"I built it as a family home, as a place where my kids would always come home to," Mr. Wilson says. "It's meant to be comfortable, with a lived-in feeling. Nothing pretentious, because that's not how we live."

This semi-detached, three-storey house is a fair distance from the Bloor Street bustle, but close to a popular park with year-round attractions, agent Theodore Babiak says.
"It's on the best part of the street," he says. Dufferin Grove Park "has a weekly farmers' market and a skating rink in the winter."
Other local attractions include a library and a recreation centre as well as the shops, cafes and restaurants in Little Italy.
The 1,887-square-foot, five-bedroom house - which is likely more than 80 years old - has an attractive brick façade that includes a bay window on the second floor.
Among the home's features are nearly nine-foot ceilings on the main level and hardwood flooring everywhere except in the eat-in kitchen, where there are laminate floors. The cooking area also has a pantry and a walkout to the garden and detached garage.
On the second floor, there is a four-piece bathroom with a claw-foot tub as well as three bedrooms. Among them is the master suite, which includes mirrored wall-to-wall closets.
Two more bedrooms occupy the top floor.
The partly finished basement contains a recreation room, laundry space and a toilet. The lower level could be turned into a separate apartment, Mr. Babiak notes.

Abstract: With real estate prices sinking, it might be time to snap up an investment property. In Vancouver, the burst bubble is yielding some bargains. But as local real-estate guru Ozzie Jurock points out, capitalization rates-net operating income divided by market value-are still very low. You'll get better immediate return in Edmonton or Saint John, where the average home costs less than $600,000. But if it's capital appreciation you're after, the Vancouver area remains a good bet.

Full text:   IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A SAFE PROPERTY WHERE YOU CAN PUT SOME CASH, WHAT'S THE BETTER BET: FAMILY DIGS OR A SMALL STRIP MALL?
With real estate prices sinking, it might be time to snap up an investment property. In Vancouver, the burst bubble is yielding some bargains. But as local real-estate guru Ozzie Jurock points out, capitalization rates-net operating income divided by market value-are still very low. You'll get better immediate return in Edmonton or Saint John, where the average home costs less than $600,000. But if it's capital appreciation you're after, the Vancouver area remains a good bet. Say you have a $5-million budget-should you buy residential or commercial? Avtar Bains, of Colliers International, says the two categories are tough to compare because they are such different asset classes. Let's try, anyway.
FAMILY VALUES
Your $5 million will buy you an apartment building in or around the city of Vancouver. Colliers analyst Joelle Wendt notes that multifamily properties typically carry less cash-flow risk than commercial retail spaces. The fact that Metro Vancouver has a rental vacancy rate south of 1% doesn't hurt, either. There is a trade-off, though: Income yield from multifamily is generally lower.
The future is anybody's guess, but one way of comparing is to find two recent sales and see how each property appreciated during the past few years. In March, 2004, a 69-suite apartment building went for $4.8 million. When it changed hands again in January, 2008, it sold for $7.5 million, a 56% increase in value, or 12% on an annual basis.
COMMERCIAL APPEAL
On the commercial end, you can find Vancouver-area retail properties in the $5-million range. Jurock says he might look for a small shopping centre with strong anchor tenants who can weather any downturn-a 7-Eleven and a liquor store, for example. At 4.16% as of December, according to Colliers, the Metro Vancouver vacancy rate for food-anchored shopping centres has almost doubled from 2007.
In June, 2002, a 32,600-square-foot, one-storey North Vancouver strip mall sold for $6.3 million. In April, 2008, new owners acquired it for $14.9 million-a 135% increase in asset value, 16% annualized.
IT'S YOUR CALL
The strip mall may have won in this exercise, but commercial retail isn't necessarily a better investment than multifamily. Because it's often lower-risk, residential could be a prudent choice in a tough economy. And whatever you purchase, it's how you buy, manage and divest yourself from the property, says Bains.
If you go the commercial route, Jurock says quality tenants are more important than capitalization rates. As for residential, he suggests haggling for 20 or 30 units in a new condo development whose builder can't find buyers. "I'd probably just leave the money in the bank and make lots of offers and see what happens. In fact, that's what I'm doing."
THE BOTTOM LINE Vancouver multifamily residential property is a more recession-proof investment than commercial retail. The return will be lower, but many smaller tenants and an ultra-low vacancy rate can mean less cash-flow volatility and higher risk-adjusted returns.

Abstract: The judge was casual. "Hi, [John Lehmann]," she would say. "How are you? What would like to talk about today." But this kinder, gentler approach hasn't kept the Downtown Eastside's addicts from reoffending. The court accepted 322 offenders from December, 2001, to March, 2005, according to an evaluation of the project done by Ottawa's ORBIS Partners Inc., and funded by the National Crime Prevention Strategy. Only 43 people - or 14 per cent - completed the treatment program.

Full text: A Globe and Mail investigation shows for the first time how much public and private money has been spent on Vancouver's Downtown Eastside since 2000: $1.4-billion. What has all that money accomplished? Limited progress at best. As Robert Matas reports, many people believe the area is worse than ever. Photography by John Lehmann
It has been nearly a decade since three levels of government signed a landmark agreement designed to transform Vancouver's notorious Downtown Eastside, but the neighbourhood remains a vortex that sucks in junkies, the mentally ill and other desperate souls from across the country.
With a year remaining in the agreement - and the 2010 Olympics about to put Vancouver in the world's spotlight - a Globe and Mail investigation has for the first time tallied how much public and private money has been poured into Canada's worst slum.
The result: More than $1.4-billion later, the Downtown Eastside is hardly better off.
An open-air drug market still thrives five minutes from a police station. The bathrooms of decrepit hotels still serve as shooting galleries for addicts. Prostitutes still offer their bodies from the curbside. Drug pushers still prey on the mentally diminished, multiplying the misery.
If there has been progress, it has been scant. The rash of drug overdoses that killed more than 1,000 people in the 1990s has dissipated, but the legion of addicts remains. HIV/AIDS is no longer epidemic, but residents' health remains abysmal.
Even the politicians who were behind the Vancouver Agreement concede defeat.
"I've worked in the Downtown Eastside for a long time, since before I got into politics, and I have never seen our community this bad," says Jenny Kwan, the NDP cabinet minister who led the province's involvement in the agreement, signed in 2000.
"I can say that honestly, politics aside, I have never seen such desperation on the streets. I walk down there in the early hours, I go down to the community, and I am literally stepping over bodies."
Spending on the Downtown Eastside is "mind-boggling," says former Vancouver mayor Philip Owen, another signatory to the agreement.
Mr. Owen says that until now he has had no firm idea of just how much money has gone into the Downtown Eastside.
That is because nobody has been keeping track.
The federal, provincial and municipal governments, the Vancouver Coastal Health Authority and more than 100 organizations working in the neighbourhood record their own spending, but none keeps a global tally. The Vancouver police department, meanwhile, won't release its budget for patrolling the Downtown Eastside.
"No one seems to have a handle on it," says Bernie Magnan, the Vancouver Board of Trade's chief economist. "We've tried several times to get it, but we cannot seem to nail down what actually goes in there."
By conducting interviews, reviewing public documents and asking groups to summarize their spending, The Globe reached a conservative estimate for health, social services, housing, law enforcement and other public services.
The grand total: At least $1,468,154,865 since the Vancouver Agreement was signed, with roughly $717.5-million spent on health and social services, $348.6-million on housing, $154.5-million on safety and justice, $230-million on economic development and $16.8-million on services that bridged those classifications.
Reaching the total was more art than science. Wherever possible, The Globe used actual spending figures, but in some cases relied on promises of spending or estimates where precise figures weren't available. The calculations include some projects and services outside the Downtown Eastside because the boundaries of the neighbourhood are fluid and some of the projects aimed at the neighbourhood's residents are located outside it.
The flood of spending has been concentrated mostly in a few squalid blocks home to about 6,000 men and women; a huge chunk has gone to about 2,100 people in crisis, health authorities say.
So why has $1.4-billion made so little difference to this relatively small population? Where did the money go?
ONE ROOM FOR THE HOMELESS: $326,484
To help solve the puzzle of how so much money has been spent on housing in the Downtown Eastside, consider the case of the Pennsylvania Hotel.
The historic five-storey structure, built in 1906 and designed by renowned local architect William Tuff Whiteway, is located on the edge of the most desolate stretch of Hastings Street, the main drag. By 2000, the once-stylish, turret-topped building was a flophouse, its 165-seat pub a drug den.
The city, provincial and federal governments worked together to restore the heritage landmark, replacing the pub with a restaurant and reconfiguring the living space into 44 units for the homeless. The antiquated structure had to be brought up to current seismic and building codes.
The province contributed $4.6-million from its housing budget and agreed to pay $341,710 annually for health workers and counsellors who work there. Ottawa contributed $4-million. The regional and city government paid an additional $2.15-million.
Developer Concord Pacific contributed $3.6-million in exchange for transfer of density to another property.
In total, it cost $14.4-million to reopen the hotel recently. That works out to $326,484 per suite, for about 250 square feet of living space, including a bathroom and kitchenette.
In the past two years, the B.C. government has bought 13 run-down residential hotels in the Downtown Eastside with the intention of fixing them up for the homeless. The final bill for the real-estate buying spree is not yet known.
The spending on housing in the neighbourhood goes well beyond buying and reviving skid-road hotels.
In 2000, the federal and provincial governments announced at least $72-million in expenditures on housing and temporary shelters in the area. Since then, an additional $104-million has gone into subsidized housing, outreach programs to homeless people and rent supplements, according to The Globe's estimate.
In the same period, city hall spent $155-million on affordable and subsidized housing throughout Vancouver. Although the city does not separate its spending by neighbourhood, a municipal official said much of the housing was for people who may have ended up in the Downtown Eastside without alternatives.
It is also difficult to calculate the total cost of government concessions granted to private developers that build in the Downtown Eastside. The $183-million Woodward's redevelopment - a four-tower project that promises to remake the western portion of the Downtown Eastside - will have 500 units priced at whatever the market dictates and 200 units of subsidized housing. The city compensated the developer with concessions worth millions of dollars for the public housing, heritage restoration and public amenities such as a daycare.
As well, the city has permits on its books for new projects worth $70-million in the Downtown Eastside. The list includes subsidized housing, market housing and renovations of an evening drop-in centre for prostitutes.
AN EXPENSIVE DRUG COURT THAT DOESN'T WORK
Like housing, law enforcement and courts for the Downtown Eastside have swallowed hundreds of millions of dollars.
Some costly judicial programs have not made a difference. One example: Vancouver's special court for drug cases, which has cost about $17-million to build and operate.
The city opened the court in 2001, embracing an idea pioneered in Toronto three years earlier. Judicial authorities hoped that the novel approach would help to combat substance abuse in the Downtown Eastside. The concept is simple: Judges offer less-severe penalties to addicts charged with narcotics crimes, provided they participate in a court-supervised, 265-hour treatment program. Also, as a condition of bail, the addicts must stay away from the neighbourhood.
The courtroom is located on the third floor of the Provincial Court building, in the heart of the Downtown Eastside, and the atmosphere is anything but typical.
On a recent day, dozens of offenders who had already pleaded guilty filled the public gallery, listening as the names of the accused were read out. Each time somebody answered and approached the bench, the gallery broke into applause.
The judge was casual. "Hi, John," she would say. "How are you? What would like to talk about today." But this kinder, gentler approach hasn't kept the Downtown Eastside's addicts from reoffending. The court accepted 322 offenders from December, 2001, to March, 2005, according to an evaluation of the project done by Ottawa's ORBIS Partners Inc., and funded by the National Crime Prevention Strategy. Only 43 people - or 14 per cent - completed the treatment program.
The analysts compared the group with 166 offenders with addiction problems who did not go to drug court. Their evaluation found the new approach produced no statistically significant reductions in new charges and convictions.
Nevertheless, the drug court continues to run in Vancouver (with some changes to the treatment program) and the concept has been expanded to include a downtown community court for mentally ill people, which opened last fall in the Downtown Eastside. The new court process was expected to integrate health and social services into the justice system.
The construction budget for the new court was $5.6-million, and the cost of operating it in its first year is expected to be about $4.4-million.
LIVING FREE IN THE DOWNTOWN EASTSIDE
Any calculation of money spent in the Downtown Eastside must include the incredible efforts of non-profit organizations and community groups that have stepped in to fill holes in the public safety net.
A directory of free services in the Downtown Eastside prepared for street people lists five shelters, seven locations for free clothing and six places for free meals. Free phones, free hair cuts, free dental work, laundry and showers are available.
At one such place, the three-storey Union Gospel Mission shelter, 76 people came for a free lunch one day last week. The menu featured smoky sausage soup, meat sandwiches, cupcakes and orange juice, and the line of mostly men in worn jackets and jeans wound down the street and around the corner.
At the door, a scruffy man who looked to be in his 20s mumbled to himself as he stood next to the front of the line. "His mind is gone," a mission worker said. "He just stands in the doorway."
The Union Gospel Mission offers more than meals. The facility sleeps 40, and offers free clothes, toothbrushes, soap, razors, counselling and courses to complete high school.
"Everything is for free," said Keela Keeping, a spokeswoman for the mission. "But it is not really attractive. It would only appeal to people who really need it."
The Union Gospel Mission, which run two additional sites in the Downtown Eastside, receives no government funds. Corporate sponsors such as Telus Corp. provide volunteers and cash.
Other groups depend heavily on government support. Some groups, such as the Downtown Eastside Youth Activities Society (DEYAS), receive almost 100 per cent of their funding from the government. No one calculates how much has been spent over the decade on those services.
And yet, after all that investment in health, safety and housing, more is required to turn the Downtown Eastside into a community just like any other in Vancouver. Considerable effort has gone into trying to re-establish businesses, provide job training for residents and brighten up the neighbourhood.
The city has kicked in $400,000 to match some of the projects financed under a $10-million provincial government grant for neighbourhood improvements, such as new awnings on buildings, new neon signs and cleaning up graffiti.
The city also made an effort to provide job training with a program of temporary work for eight people in recovery from drug use. Four went on to full-time employment. The budget for the program was $163,000.
Projects under the Vancouver Agreement are among the more aggressive attempts to change the social and economic realities in the community. The governments put $6.9-million into creating an organization to develop business in the area and help find work opportunities for residents. Building Opportunities with Business Inner City Society, better known as BOB, has achieved small victories for several people, but it has not succeeded in remaking the neighbourhood.
The agency had played a role in the purchase of $25-million worth of goods and services from suppliers in the Downtown Eastside and adjacent neighbourhoods. BOB was also involved in arrangements leading to jobs for 102 residents. But it was set up with ambitions of helping find work for many more people.
Meanwhile, government spending on social assistance rivals spending on health and housing. About 73 per cent of the 7,100 people on welfare who live in what the province considers to be the Downtown Eastside receive payment at the highest level possible. The province is paying out $70-million in this year alone. An additional $9.7-million was spent this year on help for families and children in the neighbourhood. The cash injected over the decade amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars.
LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL?
Although some believe that the Downtown Eastside is worse off now than it was a decade ago, others see progress.
Donald MacPherson, Vancouver's drug policy co-ordinator, recalls the tragic rash of overdose deaths in the 1990s. "Around 200 people died in 1993, another 200 in 1998," he said. "People were also dying of HIV at an incredible rate. There was a sense of despair on the street."
While the debate raged over the appropriate response to the urban crisis, money began to flow. At least $300-million has been spent since 2000 by the health authorities in the Downtown Eastside. More than half of the funds have gone to services and housing supports for addicts and the mentally ill. A supervised injection site, an experiment with heroin distribution and support for abstinence-based treatment brought in $31-million more.
The government also has committed funds for services for the mentally ill and addicted that are located outside the neighbourhood. In the past few years, new drug-treatment centres and institutional care for the mentally ill worth $41-million have been unveiled.
Working together under the Vancouver Agreement, the three levels of government contributed $300,000 toward a $6.5-million drug-treatment centre called The Crossing at Keremeos, which has opened in the B.C. interior and is expected to cost $2.4-million to operate in its first year.
The facility is located 350 kilometres to the east, but the Downtown Eastside is more than just a local problem, says Christine Lattey, executive director of the Vancouver Agreement's co-ordination unit. "It's a B.C. and a Canada problem."
"If you look at the Downtown Eastside, you can provide services for people who are there," she explains. "But you also have to look at how you prevent people from getting there in the first place."
According to Ms. Lattey, the Crossing at Keremeos can do just that - and is an example of how spending under the Vancouver Agreement and other programs has helped to improve situation. But it clearly hasn't helped enough.
"You just need to walk down there to see there is a lot that has not been done."

Ground zero
Vancouver's Downtown Eastside, a venerable neighbourhood plagued by drug addiction, mental illness and prostitution, is composed mostly of low-income housing and social-service agencies. About 27 per cent of the commercial frontage along Hastings Street, the main thoroughfare, is boarded up. Since there's disagreement on where the Downtown Eastside begins and ends, The Globe and Mail selected these boundaries when compiling its Statistics Canada data on the neighbourhood.

With a per capita income that's less than half the national average, the neighbourhood is among the poorest of the poor. The percentage of residents who failed to finish high school is double the average for the rest of British Columbia.
"We've basically got a Third World country stuck in the middle of downtown Vancouver," says Krishna Pendakur, a professor of economics at Simon Fraser University.
These figures have been compiled by Patrick Brethour, the Globe and Mail's British Columbia editor, drawing from the 2006 census with the help of special software from Tetrad Computer Applications Inc.

How it added up
Where did the $1.4-billion figure come from?
To find out how much money has gone into the Downtown Eastside since the city, provincial and federal governments signed the Vancouver Agreement in 2000, The Globe and Mail began by reviewing public documents and asking the various groups and agencies that operate in the area for a summary of their spending.
Where possible, hard numbers were used, but precise figures were not always available. So the tally also includes some estimates and promises of spending. (In some cases, it was impossible to avoid including projects and services that are outside the neighbourhood because the Downtown Eastside's boundaries are often interpreted differently, and some of the services provided to its residents originate elsewhere.)
In the end, a conservative assessment of the health, social services, housing, law enforcement and other public services came to at least $1,468,154,865, consisting of roughly $717.5-million for health and social services, $348.6-million for housing, $154.5-million for safety and justice, $230-million for economic development and $16.8-million on services that span categories.
For the most part, this money was spent on an area that is home to 6,000 people, the vast majority of it going to 2,100 of them who are considered to be in dire need.

Reserve judgment
14
Percentage of area residents of aboriginal descent.
The Downtown Eastside's aboriginal population is, proportionately, seven times that of Vancouver as a whole. "In some people's minds, it's the largest reserve in Canada," says John O'Neil, dean of health sciences at Simon Fraser University and a specialist in aboriginal health care.
Why so many natives? Housing costs are certainly much lower, but Mr. O'Neil says many newcomers from reserves come looking for a familiar face, despite the grim surroundings.
*****
Out of work
60
Percentage of residents not considered participants in the labour force.
Officially, the unemployment rate for the Downtown Eastside is only 5 per cent - but that's because more than six people in every 10 aren't even counted among those who have a job or are looking for one. Of those who able to work, only one in three does. That is less than half the average for B.C. and for the entire country.
"This is worse than the Great Depression," Simon Fraser University economist Krishna Pendakur says.
The official figures, of course, don't include anyone who breaks the law to earn a living.
*****
Alone and childless
7
Percentage of residents yet to reach the age of majority.
The average Downtown Eastside household consists of just 1.3 people, making it half as big as an average family elsewhere in the city, the province or the country as a whole. As well, the percentage of one-person homes (among residents 15 and older) is triple that found elsewhere, while the 7 per cent for children and teens compares with 25 for the country as a whole.

Iran's strongman shows signs of weakness

Abstract: The supreme leader backed Mr. [Ahmadinejad], and has done so since, but there have been signs that he is growing tired of the President's histrionic style and poor economic management. When Israeli troops moved into Gaza, Mr. [Ali Khamenei] quashed a bid backed by the President to recruit volunteers for "martyrdom operations." But even so, "if [Mohammad Khatami] starts getting traction," Prof. [Nader Entessar] says, "you could see a counter-reaction."

Full text: Was that really hard-liner Mahmoud Ahmadinejad offering an olive branch to Barack Obama this week? With the economy a mess and his predecessor vowing to humble him at the polls, Matthieu Aikins reports, the terror of Tehran suddenly seems to be changing his tune
For people like Mahdi Fahandari, times have always been tough in Iran. The 33-year-old labourer has struggled to make ends meet on the $6 a day he earns. Lately, however, the situation has become dire.
"Inflation is bad and prices are always rising. It's getting hard even to buy food," he says amid the noisy gloom of the welding shop where he works - a job he fears may soon disappear. "A lot of my friends are out of work."
Located 850 kilometres east of Tehran near the Afghan and Turkmenian borders, Mashhad is Iran's second-largest city and home to the mammoth Imam Reza Shrine, which makes it a destination for millions of Shia visitors. The pilgrims and the cross-border trade usually keep the economy strong, but like the rest of the country, Mashhad is feeling the pinch.
Until recently, the local real-estate market, driven by Iran's post-revolutionary baby boom, was red hot. But now "private projects have nearly dried up," says Abbas Khakshur, vice-president of Marmarbeton, a big construction firm and a major source of business for shops such as Mr. Fahandari's.
He says public spending will soon follow suit. "There is no money in the government's budget any more. We are worried about our business."
Iran runs on oil, and the plunging price of crude - from a high of $147 (U.S.) a barrel last July to less than $36 this week - has devastated the economy to so much that many Iranians believe that mismanagement by presidential firebrand Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is partly to blame.
As a result, Mr. Ahmadinejad suddenly seems vulnerable as the country prepares to go to the polls in June - especially since his predecessor, liberal cleric Mohammad Khatami, announced this week that he wants his old job back.
"The Iranian nation's historical demand is to have freedom, independence and justice, and I will work for that," Mr. Khatami said.
Is he a serious contender? His rival may think so. A few days after the reformist Mr. Khatami joined the race, he was reportedly chased through the streets of Tehran during celebrations for the Islamic Revolution's 30th anniversary by a mob of stick-wielding Ahmadinejad supporters. The same day, their champion declared himself ready to meet U.S. President Barack Obama and discuss their differences: "It is clear the Iranian nation welcomes real changes."
Mr. Ahmadinejad has been weakened by criticism of his economic performance. When the global downturn began, he ruled out any impact on Iran: "Even if the price of oil hits zero, we can manage the country for about three years."
But as the situation worsened, signs that Iran, which relies on oil for more than 80 per cent of government revenue, was being hit badly were hard to ignore. When the government set this year's budget at $37.50-a-barrel oil, compared with the $70 needed to balance last year's budget, Mr. Ahmadinejad finally acknowledged that "we will have to leave a major part of our projects behind."
'HE DOESN'T LISTEN'
By then, frustration was mounting within Iran's academic community. "They were slow to realize the problem," says Mohammad Khatib of the Mashhad Chamber of Commerce, who was among a group of 50 economists that visited the President in July to complain. Unfortunately, "he doesn't listen to economists," Prof. Khatib says.
Adjusted for inflation, Iran's per-capita gross domestic product is lower today than it was before the revolution in 1979. The latest official rates for inflation and unemployment are 26.4 and 10.2 per cent, respectively - yet both are widely considered to be underestimated. Iran holds one-10th of the world's proven reserves but has the lowest growth rate among oil producers in the region.
Addiction to oil is considered a root cause of Iran's problems. "It is widely accepted among economists that we need to reduce our dependency on oil," says Hamid Shushtarian, editor of Iran's monthly Journal of Asian Economics.
The situation began in the post-revolutionary period when, spurred by its first "supreme leader" - Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini - Iran tried to become self-sufficient. But since the presidency of Ayatollah Akbar Rafsanjani (1989-1997), which introduced limited free-market reforms, Iran's leaders have seen the need for liberalization. The country's official economic plans call for just that - Mr. Shushtarian says they "see Iran moving toward a free-market economy. Privatization is even in the constitution," which was amended in 2004 to call for the privatizing of state-run businesses.
Mr. Khatami succeeded Mr. Rafsanjani in 1997 and continued his policies, also with limited success. In the 2005 election campaign, however, Mr. Ahmadinejad pledged to distribute oil revenues to the average Iranian. He has been hostile to an overly "Western" approach to reform, and reluctant to alienate his base among the rural poor.
Recently, in response to the looming budget deficit, he proposed slashing Iran's gasoline and electricity subsidies - and handing the cash directly to the poor, a move that exasperates economists. "When you have a limited supply and you increase purchasing power," Prof. Khatib says, "then prices just go up."
Inflation and unemployment are higher today than when Mr. Ahmadinejad came to power, sparking a widespread sentiment that not only has he failed to deliver on his promises, his profligate spending has wasted the chance at reform oil money once offered.
As a result, Mr. Ahmadinejad has seen his support weaken considerably, even among conservatives. In recent months, conservative "pragmatists" who oppose his re-election have gathered around Mr. Rafsanjani, now an influential member of the Assembly of Experts, the secretive body that appoints the supreme leader. He can't stand for the presidency again because of his age (he turns 75 tomorrow), but Mr. Rafsanjani still leads traditional conservatives supported by the wealthy elite. They dislike Mr. Ahmadinejad's economic policies and his erratic, confrontational behaviour on the world stage.
Until this week, they were seen as the President's most significant opposition, with Tehran Mayor Mohammad Ghalibaf and former interior minister Mostafa Pour-Mohammadi touted as their leading candidates. The reformists, who seek greater democracy, social liberty and foreign engagement, have performed poorly of late because their base - the educated middle class - is disillusioned with the system and failed to vote in great numbers.
But the return of Mr. Khatami may change all that.
"There is no one with equal power to ignite the modern section of society," says Sayed Hosseini, professor of sociology at the Azad University of Mashhad and himself a former reformist politician. On the other hand, he says, the rise of Mr. Khatami may unite conservatives around Mr. Ahmadinejad. "They will vote for him holding their noses."
And although Mr. Khatami was elected in 1997 on a groundswell of popular support, especially among women and students, the optimism dimmed while he was in office because the establishment stymied many of his reforms. "I have my doubts about the Khatami of 2009," says Nader Entessar, chair of political science at the University of Southern Alabama and an expert on Iranian politics. "Eight years was enough for people to get to know him, and you can't pinpoint one instance where he stood his ground when he was challenged by the conservatives. Most of his achievements were rhetorical."
With the economy, however, Mr. Khatami stands on firmer ground. "The leadership never opposed his economic reforms," Mr. Shushtarian says. "The review of his economic management is positive. ... I think he would be successful again because he is a man who refers to specialists."
MILITARY BROADSIDE
Hard-liners are concerned enough to take potshots. In a recent speech endorsing Mr. Ahmadinejad, military commander Hassan Firouzabadi said the presidency "requires a lot of energy and competence," and is not "for old, retired people" - a clear dig at Mr. Khatami, 13 years older than the 52-year-old President.
It was the first time, Prof. Entessar says, "that any senior military officer has made a public endorsement like this." Even more significant: the silence of supreme leader Grand Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. "During Khomeini's time, he made it very clear the military had no place in politics. Not so with Khamenei."
What role the Grand Ayatollah, who holds the final political authority, will play in the election is much pondered (but not openly). Mr. Khamenei will decide how much pressure will be applied on the election process by the security and judicial systems.
"When Khatami first ran in 1997," Prof. Entessar says, "nobody gave him much of a chance, and they saw no need to micromanage the election." But after he had served two terms, "it was a different story. The security organizations were heavily involved."
The supreme leader backed Mr. Ahmadinejad, and has done so since, but there have been signs that he is growing tired of the President's histrionic style and poor economic management. When Israeli troops moved into Gaza, Mr. Khamenei quashed a bid backed by the President to recruit volunteers for "martyrdom operations." But even so, "if Khatami starts getting traction," Prof. Entessar says, "you could see a counter-reaction."
Then again, the election's first round is bound to feature an array of candidates from across the political spectrum. Conservatives will face off with reformists, and there is even speculation that Mir-Hossein Mousavi, prime minister during the war against Iraq, also will attempt a comeback, after 21 years, as a reform candidate.
It may seem a long shot, but neither Mr. Khatami nor Mr. Ahmadinejad was a serious contender when he started out. "One thing about the past two or three elections in Iran is that a candidate who wasn't even known at the time came out on top," Prof. Entessar says. "So it's possible that we might see surprises again."

Full text: Gambier Island, off the B.C. coast, has drawn some of Canada's best contemporary architects, with homes intended to reinterpret the traditional cottage
Gambier Island harks back to the golden age of cottaging on Canada's West Coast.
Not served by a car ferry, Gambier, unlike the Gulf Islands, has avoided the excesses of overdevelopment, including "monster" cottages.
In fact, the island's largely undiscovered and aesthetically untainted landscape has become a siren call for many Vancouver architects looking to reinterpret the traditional cottage along modernist lines. Three firms, for example - Battersby Howat, Helliwell + Smith: Blue Sky Architecture, and McFarlane Green Biggar Architecture and Design - all have rather edgy (but small-scale) residential projects under way there.
Ultimately, Gambier - already a haven for artists and writers - may well become known as much for its aesthetic as its natural beauty.
There are 125 full-time residents on the island, although the number swells to about 600 in the summer. But as Gambier is larger than neighbouring Bowen Island, it's low in density and relatively quiet. Many houses are off-grid, there is very little phone service and everything has to be brought in by boat or water taxi - a 20-minute ride from Horseshoe Bay, just north of central Vancouver.
Gambier's public life revolves around a general store and small community centre. And as many Gulf islands become more expensive and serve almost as bedroom communities of nearby cities - Bowen to Vancouver, Saltspring to Victoria and Gabriola to Nanaimo - Gambier still offers a wilderness-tinged experience far from the madding crowds.
"There's a great opportunity on Gambier for houses to respond to site," says architect Michael Green, a principal at McFarlane Green Biggar, whose modernist take on the cottage is nestled dramatically against a steep hillside overlooking Brigade Bay, and providing a panoramic view of Howe Sound.
Mr. Green says the wide variety of topography - from steep to flat, cliff side to forested - seems to prevent a proliferation of homogeneous architecture, making Gambier a somewhat maverick in the area, both in terms of lifestyle and aesthetics.
In designing the 1,700-square-foot, off-grid residence, scheduled for completion this spring, Mr. Green was inspired by the island's "wildness," in the great architectural tradition of "harnessing the elements." But those same natural qualities - not to mention the site's remoteness, and the cost and difficulty of transporting materials and workers by barge and boat - also limited design options.
"Maintainability was a big issue," the architect says. "Our clients didn't want to have to sweep off roofs and gutters after being away for a few months in the winter." Ergo, the house's flat roofs and no discernible gutters that may clog with leaves and debris. Rather, water drops off to the cliff face toward the south and runs to the ocean without damaging the house.
Building on a rocky outcrop, where three sides of the house are completely constrained by topography, and meeting an environmental covenant that stipulates the dwelling must be 50 feet back from the high-tide line, posed a challenge. Namely, Mr. Green says, "how to make a building that was livable and cost effective - but fit the complex geography we were given."
The result was, in essence, two boxes - one perched on top of the other. A living room/dining space on the bottom stretches east-west to catch the water view, while the bedrooms and a deck on top have a north-south orientation to capitalize on both mountain views and sunlight.
The palette of materials - red cedar throughout, with more durable and contemporary-feeling fibre cement and metal siding, as well as plenty of door-sized windows to maximize the view - make this the model modernist aerie. Rather modest looking when approaching from the road, it's somewhat more acrobatic in appearance from the waterfront.
The Battersby Howat residence, completed last year, also boasts a cliff-side location.
"When I first saw the site," David Battersby says, "I knew I wanted to avoid imposing anything on it in an obvious way." The result is a cottage that manages to feel clean and modern but also like a natural extension of the site.
Rather than two distinct sides, the residence offers a fluid, unifying sense of space, with an unimpeded view from the picture window facing the waterfront through to the master bedroom facing the forest.
Cladding alternates between clear and darkly stained cedar siding - with the latter consisting of randomly patterned two-, four- and eight-inch planks for a textured effect that mimics tree bark. The vertically arranged siding also acts as a natural rain screen.
Most of the interior millwork is local fir facade - cousins to the fir trees that surround the cottage, which the architects took great pains to preserve during the building process. And the bedrock on site was blasted only when absolutely necessary, with much of it integrated into the design itself.
The 2,000-square-foot residence is appropriately scaled for the site. As Mr. Battersby says: "The classic 1950s cottages of [Ron] Thom and [Arthur] Erickson were small-scale and intense - they weren't meant to be 8,000 square feet."
Indeed, small is beautiful on Gambier. Bo Helliwell and Kim Smith of Blue Sky Architecture, who are at work on their third island house, note that "monster homes," such as the suburban-sprawl-style ones on Bowen Island, are simply not possible.
"Because of Gambier's remoteness," Ms. Smith notes, "it's hard to blast and mould in aggressive ways. Here you have to follow the contours of the topography as much as possible."
Blue Sky's 2002 Murphy House, a 2,200-square-foot residence of red cedar accented by local granite, follows an old deer path, which, in turn, traces the contours of the little cove it overlooks. Accordingly, there is a certain sculptural quality to the house, a sense of movement and fluidity. Every room - including an outdoor one - has a different view or "framing" of Centre Bay.
The steeply graded site of the house, which should be completed this spring, forced them to carve a platform within the cliff and follow the contour of the hill, which also forms the bay. A temporary pulley and ramp system was devised to get building materials up from the dock.
The free-flowing organic structure with a graceful downward eastern slope is anchored to the cliff on one end, while the master bedroom forms an aggressive cantilever on the other that floats off the end of the cliff above the bay. Sleeping there, Mr. Helliwell says, "will feel like [you're in] a bird house in the trees."
A third house is to be built on a big, south-facing rock bluff, anchored by a concrete base and covered by a curving vaulted roof. A large granite fireplace will open to an outdoor room.
Mr. Helliwell and Ms. Smith agree that Gambier, like the clients attracted to building there, is unique. There's something humbling, and vaguely pioneering, they explain, about journeying to a place with 14-foot waves in the winter.
"It's definitely about the wilderness," Mr. Helliwell says of the island, which offers ruggedness, and increasingly, little modernist gems.

Full text: If you're in the business of selling real estate, a down market means it's time to get creative, reports Carolyn Ireland
Vancouver real estate agent Kye Grace was pleased with the turnout for an open house he recently hosted in a Gastown loft. He just didn't get as much sleep as he had hoped.
The unit in a converted glass factory had remained on the market for longer than a year, so when Mr. Grace took over the listing, he decided to try a new tactic.
He brainstormed with a friend and came up with the idea of a marathon 72-hour open house, in which he let house hunters tour the $999,950 loft space in person and on-line.
With houses and condominium units languishing in many of North America's real estate markets, agents are searching for all sorts of creative new ways to reach prospective buyers and generate attention. Mr. Grace's three-day open house garnered the publicity he was looking for and a third showing for one prospective purchaser this weekend.
In Toronto, one agent recently co-hosted a party for hundreds of people in a condominium sales office decked out with all of the lighting, decor and atmosphere of a night club.
In Pickering, another agent offered a 42-inch television to the buyer of a 20-year-old detached house.
Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and Bluetooth are increasingly becoming the tools of technology-savvy agents.
In the United States,
marketing organizations are offering agents the opportunity to target niche groups
at such websites as gayrealestatelistings.com and sexyrealtors.com.
This week the Canadian Real Estate Association predicted that home sales nationally will tumble by 16.9 per cent in 2009 compared with 2008. That expected drop follows a 17.1 per cent decline in 2008 compared with the previous year.
British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario will see the sharpest slides, according to CREA chief economist Gregory Klump.
Mr. Klump's report also forecasts an 8 per cent fall in the national average house price to $279,400 in 2009 from $303,594 in 2008.
Looking out to 2010, CREA sees a rebound in sales and more stable prices.
Mr. Klump is predicting that sales will rise 9.9 per cent in 2010, on average, across the country. The average national price will edge up 1.1 per cent next year compared with this year.
Beth Crosbie Alexander is a St. John's-based agent who is chairing a CREA task force looking into the business challenges facing young realtors.
CREA tallied about 100,000 members last year and budgeted for 97,000 this year. However, that number could go even lower, says Ms. Crosbie Alexander.
Mr. Grace, an agent with Sutton Group-Killarney Realty measured the success of his open house by the number of people who viewed the web site and visited the property, along with the media attention he has been receiving. More than 1,400 unique viewers viewed the live stream while approximately 100 people toured the unit in person.
"It's pretty tough to get 100 people to come to a $1-million house," says Mr. Grace.
Gastown, he says, is trendy and touristy but some potential buyers could be deterred by the fact that it's right next to Vancouver's grittier East Side neighbourhood.
Mr. Grace was also frustrated that one of the condo's coolest selling features - it's location in a converted warehouse for Pilkington Glass Co. - seemed to be keeping some potential buyers from seeing beyond the rustic facade.
"I think that was the big hurdle."
During the live stream, Mr. Grace talked on-camera with visitors. He filled about an hour and a half by chatting with a home inspector who took questions from viewers. He blogged and sent out updates on Twitter. When he took a break off camera, he ordered take-out and tried to catch some sleep.
"You can only do so much sitting in one spot before you get a little loopy," he says. "I didn't get as much sleep as I wanted."
A handful of people admitted to Mr. Grace that they showed up just because they were intrigued by the idea, but he figures about 40 out of the 100 were genuinely interested in the property.
The agent, who has been selling real estate for less than two years, says he was drawn to the business because he sees an opportunity for someone with creative ideas to gain an advantage.
"I sat and looked around for an industry where complacency would give someone with an entrepreneurial mind an edge," he says. "I came into this business knowing it was a bit staunch and I needed to do something fresh," he says.
Also in Vancouver, Ehsan Sharenejad of Macdonald Realty Ltd. is launching a service that uses Bluetooth to advertise properties to individual cell phone users.
In Toronto, Yossi Kaplan of Harvey Kalles Real Estate Ltd. recently had about 200 people turn out for a function at the Bohemian Embassy Condos on Queen St. West. Representatives of builder Baywood Homes were there, along with a mortgage expert from a chartered bank.
Mr. Kaplan says such gatherings provide an opportunity for guests to meet the designers, developers, builders and engineers involved in projects without being subjected to a heavy sales pitch.
"First and foremost it's just a way for people to interact."
Mr. Kaplan also appears in video tours of condo projects and posts the file on YouTube.
His aim, he says, is to overcome the intimidation that many young people feel when they consider buying a property for the first time.
"The real estate business is scary, it's big, it's going to take your money for months and months for years to come," he says of the prevailing attitude that he encounters among some twenty-somethings.
After his 72-hour open house, Mr. Grace received a phone call from a real estate agent near Atlanta who is trying to sell a 4,000-square-foot "executive" home in the suburbs. The agent asked Mr. Grace for ideas on how to increase traffic.
"Get the circus on the front lawn," was Mr. Grace's advice. He suggested renting an inflatable play area for the kids to jump around in, or bringing in fire fighters from the local department to talk about household safety. The agent could hire clowns and set up popcorn machines.
"Make it so kids want to come and their parents will have to come with them," he says.
Mr. Grace says he doesn't mind brainstorming with an agent who calls him looking for input. After all, it's unlikely he'll ever be selling a 4,000-square-foot executive home outside Atlanta, he reasons.
"I think if the industry changes or loosens up a little bit, it's better for everyone," he says.

Full text: Don't let the lure of recessionary bargains blind you to the risks of buying property or businesses abroad
Whether it's for a vacation refuge, retirement spot or business dream, buying property in a foreign land has an exotic appeal. But while some experts say the current economic downturn is a choice time to buy, financial and tax advisers warn that venturing outside your home country can involve dizzying financial, legal and other problems.
"There's a romanticism about having something in some other place - some exotic foreign jurisdiction. Or it may be related to an area of convenience for the family, where everyone can come together for certain occasions," says Brett Simpson, a certified financial planner (CFP) with Rogers Group Financial in Vancouver.
Buyers may find bargains, but dollar signs shouldn't cloud reason or reality, says Tina Tehranchian, a CFP and branch manager at Assante Capital Management Ltd. in Richmond Hill, Ont.
"I have clients who have been buying property anywhere from Florida to Dubai. You also have property bubbles forming in Spain and Panama," Ms. Tehranchian says. "Some are looking for vacation properties and some are looking for investment properties.
"But you have to make sure you're willing to make the commitment to go down there, do the due diligence, do your homework beforehand, take into account all the maintenance costs and hassles, [and] figure out who's going to look after your investment when you're not there," she says.
The National Association of Realtors in the United States has reported a dramatic increase in buying by foreign customers in the past five years. Some real estate agencies are reported to be wooing foreign investors by paying their travel expenses and providing agents who speak foreign languages.
Despite the "buy now" message, Canadian investors must assess whether a foreign investment - be it a business or other property - fits into their futures, says Mr. Simpson.
"Your investment decisions should be evaluated in the context of an overall financial plan, not independent of it," he says. "Too many people end up with a plan that is just a collection of stuff - their plan comes by default instead of, 'Here's what I want to have, here's what I need to accomplish my objectives.' "
In the case of Sharon Hobin, a school trustee in Mississauga, Ont., buying a home in Florida wasn't a snap decision. Ms. Hobin, 56, and her family took more than four years to find and buy their dream retirement home in Sarasota when the Canadian dollar was riding high over the greenback last spring.
"For years we would go to Florida on vacation and loved it in Sarasota, and we would say, 'This would be the nicest place to retire.' "
Ms. Hobin says one of the smartest moves she and her family made was to consult a real estate agent who found exactly what they were looking for: a two-bedroom home with all the furnishings, in a gated community, for $300,000 (U.S.). Ms. Hobin recommends finding an agent with links to other legal and financial experts who can conduct title searches or find an insurer, for example. For a mortgage, she consulted her Canadian bank, Royal Bank of Canada, which directed her to RBC Centura in the U.S.
"We learned a lot about owning a place in Florida - for pest control, the home is sprayed outside and inside once a year because of the bugs in that area, and sand fleas. There's a lot of research you need to do. For us, though, we probably had a little less to worry about because this is not a rental property for us: This is where we're going to retire," she says.
Whether you're buying a property for retirement or vacation or as an income-producer, one of the biggest considerations for investing abroad is taxes, experts say.
For example, many countries levy a form of capital gains tax against property sellers, and buyers can end up paying more if they are non-residents. Some countries, such as Canada and the United States, share a double-taxation treaty that prevents foreign owners from paying taxes twice.
"Check the tax rules: Speak to a tax expert in that particular jurisdiction because there are withholding taxes for non-residents not just in the U.S. but in many countries," Ms. Tehranchian says.
The experts also warn that buying into a foreign business may involve even more intricate taxation rules - depending on the type of business and how it's structured - as well as laws governing what happens to foreign-owned assets in case of death.
Ms. Tehranchian gives this example: "In certain Muslim countries, the rules of inheritance are subject to Muslim law - your Canadian will will not necessarily be honoured, for instance, if you leave everything to your cat, because according to the rules of Islam, you can't will property to your pet if you have a next of kin.
"There are also complicated tax rules when it comes to U.S. estate taxes," she adds.
Mr. Simpson stresses that it's important to have someone in the community where you buy property - be it a management company, a partner or someone you trust - looking after your investment.
"If you're a silent shareholder in a business, and not going over there and working actively in it, you have to look at how to manage that relationship," Mr. Simpson says. "You have to trust whoever you have working there."
Ms. Hobin's experience with one aspect of her new Florida home serves as a warning that no matter how careful a foreign purchaser is, unpleasant things can happen.
For three months, she was unaware that cheques sent to the Florida power company for her water and electricity were not being accepted. The utilities "sent us notes to say your cheques are bouncing, and threatening to cut off water and electricity," she recalls.
Her Canadian banker told her that other clients were in the same boat: U.S. banks were growing more cautious because of the economic downturn and suddenly began turning away cheques from foreigners.
"Now they just take the amount directly out of our bank account in the U.S.," Ms. Hobin says. "That's why it's so important to have a U.S. bank account in these situations."
DOS AND DON'TS
Tips for investing in property abroad:
* Do investigate the tax, residency, estate and other rules where you aim to buy land, a home or business. Don't forget to check out crime rates. If you're participating in an auction or foreclosure, ensure there are no liens or outstanding debts linked to a property.
* Do look into hiring a management company or a local overseer to look after the property when you are away (something that may be required by the insurance company).
* Do expect to put down huge deposits to pay for utilities and telephone service until you establish a local credit rating.
* Do surround yourself with reputable professionals - real estate agents, lawyers, land-title experts and management professionals - who can help you put a property game plan together. Never sign anything without having your lawyer look at it first.
* Do leave a paper trail. Never pay for anything, even a small deposit, with cash.
* Don't take at face value any claims that a property is a surefire investment that will reap great returns. Buying a property for retirement or vacation purposes is one thing; expecting a property to make you rich is another.
* Don't be swayed by people who wine and dine you, hoping you will sign on the dotted line. Seek out independent, credible opinions on whether any opportunity is a good one.

Full text: The telecom gear maker will review nearly all its assets and contracts under a new restructuring process - and will cut more jobs
TELECOM REPORTER
***
Less than a month into bankruptcy protection, Nortel Networks Corp. has begun a new restructuring process that puts nearly every aspect of the business on the table and will involve further job cuts around the world.
The ailing maker of telecom gear is reviewing the strategic and economic value of its assets and looking at reworking supplier and customer contracts as it continues to bleed cash under bankruptcy protection, according to a filing by Ernst & Young, the court-appointed monitor in Nortel's bankruptcy case.
On Jan. 14, when Nortel filed for creditor protection, it had a consolidated cash balance of about $2.4-billion (U.S.). A lot of that money, however, is unavailable to fund operations because it is tied up in joint ventures and by international regulations. In China, for example, Nortel says its cash is generally only available to fund local operations.
Of the $2.4-billion, cash available from North American operations amounted to just $731-million. A cash flow forecast for the entire company showed that Nortel expects to run in the red to the tune of $90-million between Feb. 1 and May 2, with receipts of $348-million and disbursements of $438-million.
Initiatives under way include "a detailed plan for the reduction of its global work force" and "a review of real estate and other property leases," the Ernst & Young filing said, adding that the "shape and direction" of the company's latest restructuring plan "will take some time to develop."
Last September, Nortel announced plans to reorganize itself into three divisions, which analysts said would pave the way for the breakup of the company. Executives also said they were looking for a buyer for Nortel's Metro Ethernet Networks unit, which includes cutting-edge optical Ethernet products and is responsible for about 14 per cent of overall sales. But asset sales are now on hold as Nortel reviews its options.
Less than two weeks ago, the company pulled out of a project with Israel-based Alvarion Inc. that was set up to develop and market high-speed wireless gear using a standard called WiMAX. The move was taken to preserve cash, the court filing said.
Nortel has also undertaken a detailed plan to reduce discretionary spending. One step includes the cancellation of its leases with Skyservice Business Aviation Inc. for two Challenger jets that were costing the company about $12-million a year. One of the jets was provided to Nortel's chief executive officer Mike Zafirovski for business travel, commuting and limited personal use. Nortel ceased using the second aircraft in early 2008 and tried to recoup costs by chartering it to others through Skyservice, without much success, said Mohammed Nakhooda, a spokesman for the company.
Under creditor protection, Nortel is able to cancel both aircraft leases without incurring a financial penalty, he added.
Nortel has been in a near-constant state of restructuring since the technology meltdown in 2000. Its headcount has dropped to less than 30,000 from more than 90,000, and its shares have stumbled to just 11 cents (Canadian) on the Toronto Stock Exchange, after peaking at more than $1,100 (adjusted for a stock consolidation several years ago).
The company has suffered nearly $7-billion (U.S.) in losses and eliminated thousands of jobs since Mr. Zafirovski took the helm in November, 2005.

Full text: Victoria is hoping the federal government's budget stimulus will help it address years of deferred maintenance
Tight budgets and a tough financing environment have thrown up roadblocks for Canadian cities eager to upgrade their aging infrastructure.
That's why the recent federal budget was watched closely by staff in cities such as Victoria, where the engineering department recently reported that the city needs $20.7-million a year for the foreseeable future to replace elements of its aging infrastructure - some of it dating to the late 19th century.
Victoria hopes to tap some of the $12-billion tagged for infrastructure projects over the next two years. Ottawa designed the funding as an economic stimulus; municipalities such as Victoria see it as an important boost to existing funding programs.
Besides improving aging sewers and a bridge, the funding is expected to provide some spinoff benefits, such as keeping tradespeople employed and spending their money in the community, as well as helping to attract businesses to the city's office and industrial space, officials say.
"It is really welcome," said Mike McCliggott, acting city manager and a former finance director for Victoria, who says the budget announcement is an important step in addressing the challenges municipalities across the country face.
"Could we have used this five years ago? Sure. But they have had infrastructure programs all along," he said. "This is just a little more substantive, and I think it's great."
A report prepared for the Federation of Canadian Municipalities in 2007 estimated the total infrastructure deficit in Canada - the shortfall in spending on key projects ranging from sewers to sports arenas - at $123-billion.
Most of the infrastructure identified in that report was built between the 1950s and the 1970s, but the situation in Victoria is much more dire. Most of the sewer and storm water systems date from before 1920, after which infrastructure funding became a low priority for many B.C. municipalities. Postwar boom times saw renewed investment, with water systems undergoing significant expansion in Victoria between the 1950s and 1989.
Today, Victoria manages about $1.7-billion in infrastructure but has projects in need of $455.9-million in immediate funding. The sewer systems need $92.5-million in upgrades, while those in the downtown core could use $29.5-million in additional capacity as the population there becomes more dense. Amenities such as public pools could benefit from $50-million in funding, while city hall is in need of $17.5-million in improvements. Meanwhile, plates on the Johnson Street bridge are rusting, jeopardizing the iconic structure's future.
But just $10.4-million is tagged for infrastructure projects in Victoria in 2009.
The amount is something Mike Lai, an assistant director with Victoria's engineering services department, who helped prepare a December report to city councillors on the state of the city's infrastructure, believes is inadequate. The city's annual budget addresses continuing needs, but additional funding from Ottawa will help Victoria address years of deferred infrastructure maintenance.
"[It] would allow for us to accelerate how much we're doing," Mr. Lai said. "We see it as being able to piggyback onto what we are trying to budget for and would help us to do more on a yearly basis."
He added that, since material costs have decreased, new funding will go a lot further than it did at the height of the construction boom of recent years.
But without details regarding how Ottawa plans to allocate the funds, Victoria faces challenges planning its own budget strategy in order to make the best use of any federal funds it secures, he said. "We're hoping that there will be monies that we can access to help with a number of these projects. We don't know at this point how much could be available to the city.
"We're going to be competing with all the other municipalities right across the country. So how the federal government prioritizes these requests is going to be an enormous task."
Victoria, in turn, would have to set its own priorities for funding.
While the engineering department hasn't been swamped with complaints, substandard infrastructure boosts development costs. The city recently began requiring some projects to incorporate sewage-holding tanks to address greater loads on the city's sewage system during peak hours. The tanks discharge their contents into the municipal system on a timed basis, except in off-peak hours.
Some consultants estimate the cost at about $1,000 extra per residential unit, not to mention the added loss of space sacrificed to accommodate the holding tank and pumping equipment.
Glen Wilson, president of the Victoria chapter of the Urban Development Institute that represents 78 local companies in both the residential and commercial sectors, said the additional requirements create a less favourable environment for developers.
Moreover, as other projects shut down, the city risks losing tradespeople to other jurisdictions.
"Putting the trades back to work is important because if we don't employ them, then our economy is going to be affected," Mr. Wilson said.
While there are several projects worthy of funding, Mr. Wilson fears that plans for many of them aren't to the point where Ottawa would commit funds.
"We've got bridges that need work, we've got all kinds of things that need work, but whether any of these things will be able to get on paper fast enough to be able to take advantage of [the funding], I'm not sure," he said.
Mr. Wilson expects the province to administer any federal infrastructure funding. Since the B.C. Liberal government is at the opposite end of the political spectrum from Victoria and other municipal governments, politics could further slow the delivery of any infrastructure grants Victoria tries to tap, he suggested.
In the meantime, a variety of companies setting up shop in Victoria on the strength of fresh funding for defence projects bodes well for local landlords.
Ottawa-based submarine services company CSMG Inc. has taken 30,000 square feet of industrial space in the local market while Fleetway Inc., a division of Irving Shipping, is leasing approximately 10,000 square feet of downtown office space to support its work retrofitting frigates.
"The infrastructure programs that they're doing with [the Department of National Defence] has actually yielded new tenants, new jobs for Victoria," said Andrew Turner, managing director with Colliers International in Victoria. "I can only imagine that will escalate once that infrastructure program is rolled out. ... It can't help but impact commercial real estate in many ways, from the industrial through to the service companies that occupy office space."

Full text: Obama makes case for swift action; plan expected to include 'bad bank' and billions for foreclosure relief
Barack Obama is preparing to harness the vast resources of the U.S. government to counter the deepening recession, rolling out a New Deal-like combination of massive economic stimulus and a sweeping bank rescue.
The U.S. President takes his case for bold and speedy action directly to Americans tonight in a prime time news conference, to be followed by Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner's unveiling tomorrow of a revamped strategy to get credit flowing again to consumers and businesses.
"We need an approach that's very different than the approach that we had that brought us to this point," Lawrence Summers, director of Mr. Obama's National Economic Council, said yesterday on ABC's This Week .
"That's what the President is providing ... a very wide cross-section of opinion believes that this economy needs help quickly."
The bank rescue is expected to include hundreds of billions of dollars for foreclosure relief, loan-loss insurance for troubled banks, plus the creation of a "bad bank" to purge the toxic assets that are choking the banking system.
Meanwhile, U.S. Senate Democrats say they finally have enough votes to win approval as early as tomorrow for an $827-billion (U.S.) stimulus package.
But that won't be the end of the road for Mr. Obama's ambitious stimulus plan.
Negotiators must then reconcile the differences between the Senate package and an earlier $820-billion stimulus bill passed by the House of Representatives. The Senate version leans more heavily on tax cuts, while the House bill puts more money into states, local governments and schools.
The eyes of Canada and the world are turned to Mr. Obama as he confronts the central challenge of his young presidency - righting the world's largest economy.
Dominique Strauss-Kahn, head of the International Monetary Fund, ominously warned yesterday that the United States, Europe and Japan are "already in depression."
Worried that the global economy is headed for a much deeper fall than many economists expect, Mr. Strauss-Kahn wants the rest of the world to follow Mr. Obama's lead in boosting spending and cleaning up banking problems.
"The worst cannot be ruled out," Mr. Strauss-Kahn said in Kuala Lumpur, where he was attending a gathering of central bankers from Southeast Asia.
Most economists avoid the term depression, which conjures up the Great Depression of the 1930s, when unemployment soared to more than 30 per cent in many countries. Unemployment in most major countries is well below 10 per cent, but rising fast.
In January, the IMF cut its world-growth estimate for this year to 0.5 per cent, the weakest pace since the Second World War.
Stimulus packages alone won't succeed in dragging the global economy out of recession unless confidence is restored in the banking system, Mr. Strauss-Kahn said.
"All this will work if, and only if, the different countries are likely to do what they have to do in terms of restructuring the banking sector," he said. "And today it's not done."
Meanwhile, Republicans in Congress accused Mr. Obama of already going way too far.
House Leader John Boehner said both the House and Senate stimulus plans are too big and misguided.
"All I know is the direction of it certainly doesn't look good," he told Fox News. "It looks like way, way too much money that will produce very little results."
The White House had planned to unveil its new banking rescue plan today. Mr. Geithner opted to delay the announcement until tomorrow, while the administration concentrates on getting the stimulus package through the Senate.
Mr. Geithner is expected to refocus the use of the $700-billion Troubled Asset Relief Fund - roughly half of which has already been spent - but is not expected to immediately ask Congress for more resources.
The changes spread the government's reach and influence in the banking industry.
The centerpiece of Mr. Geithner's plan is expected to be the creation of an aggregator, or bad bank, to take soured loans off the books. The bank would be set up with government seed money, but include incentives to encourage private investors.
"We are going to solve it by being as effective and strategic as we possibly can in the use of public money so as to catalyze and spur private investment," said Mr. Summers, the White House economic adviser and former Treasury Secretary.
Mr. Geithner is also expected to provide details of a new insurance program to shield banks from still undisclosed losses on mortgages and other assets.
The Treasury likewise is looking at making all future capital injections into banks as convertible bonds or preferred shares, potentially giving the U.S. government stakes in financial institutions.
And as much as $100-billion will be used to help prevent the wave of foreclosures that are dragging down home values across the country.
Also tomorrow, U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Ben Bernanke is due to testify before a congressional committee. He is expected to announce details of a plan to broaden lending to commercial and residential real estate.

Full text: People say to me, "Doyle, what's happening in the world of TV?" And I say, "Well, lots actually." And sometimes I'm, like, talking to some people and somebody will have the brilliant idea of saying, "Doyle, what are the Top Three shows on TV right now?"
This can turn out to be an unfortunate incident. Because, at that moment, I could be thinking to myself, "Maybe Jose Mourinho has got it all wrong at Inter Milan. He should be using a three-pronged attack with Ibrahimovic in the middle, flanked by Mancini and Figo, with Luis Jimenez behind them in the creative midfield role." Honestly, this does happen. In such instances I have been known to assert that if you're not watching Special 1 TV on Setanta, you're a fool.
Mostly, however, people want bits of news, gossip, trends, innuendo, visions of the future. Hence and herewith: 10 Things You Should Know About TV Now.
1. One of the most popular shows on the planet airs tonight. That's The 133rd Annual Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show (Animal Planet, 8 p.m.). There's a huge audience for this critter hoopla. Viewers are gripped by America's top dogs as they wag, waddle, pose and strut their way around Madison Square Garden, hoping to make it to the pedestal in hopes of winning the title Best in Show.
The publicity material promises "nail-biting real-life suspense and high doggy drama!" The event is the second-longest continuously held sporting event in the United States, trailing the Kentucky Derby by only one year. Yes, it is.
2. Speaking of Animal Planet, the U.S. version of the channel will soon air Jockeys , a 12-episode series taking viewers behind the scenes of "the backstabbing, big-money, dangerous world of horse racing." I'm sure it will air in Canada soon because one of the jockeys featured is Canadian Chantal Sutherland, who is dating one of the other featured jockeys, Mike Smith. Sometimes they are in competition with each other in a race. Now that's a soap opera.
3. There's a rumour going around that CBC is good-to-go on a new drama for next season in which all the characters are named Doyle. I spoof you not. The rumour that I've been consulted on casting is totally untrue.
4. Being Erica moves to Wednesdays at 9 p.m. this week, bumping the fifth estate to Fridays. The ratings for last Wednesday's fifth estate were 736,000 viewers. The funniest thing you can possibly read right now is the grousing of persons-who-write-TV-shows about the fact that some more old-fashioned TV viewers don't think the fifth estate should be bumped for a drama show. These writers will stab you with their pencils if you disagree with them. Usually they stab each other in the back with their pencils.
5. The Access Hollywood show says that recently ousted American Idol contestant Katrina Darrell, who appeared on the show in a bikini, is considering an offer to pose for Playboy. Bikini Girl is reported to have said of the Playboy offer, "I wouldn't say no, but at the same time I don't want to stunt my career by jumping into that too soon and be labelled once again, as 'just a body.' But I don't knock it." Access Hollywood also noted that she made her remarks wearing "a strapless, corseted black dress, ankle boots and hot pink nails."
6. Next, and unrelated, President Barack Obama is giving a prime-time press conference tonight. It's live on the all-news channels at 8.
7. Definitely related - CBS is asking the on-air talent on many of its shows to forgo the annual pay raises built into their salary contracts. There's a recession going on, they've been told. Coming soon, a reality series - "Stars Without Salary-Increases. Pain. Embarrassment. Depression."
8. So far this season on 24 (Fox, Global, 9 p.m.) and only seven hours in, it is estimated that Jack Bauer and his sidekicks have killed 280 people.
9. It's pilot season. So far, it looks like a lot of crime dramas, medical series and lawyer shows are being made by the U.S. networks. Of course, there's always a promised "twist" on the formulas. There's an underage crime-solver, an amateur one and a "past-life investigator." In the medical category, Fox has a drama about a schizophrenic surgeon.
10. The New York Times says, "Television advertisements are adjusting to the recession more speedily than the programming they bracket." Too true.

Also airing tonight
God Bless America (Vision, 10 p.m.) is a truly excellent documentary series. Ralph Benmergui goes to the United States to learn how and why religious faith has come to play such an important role in the political life there. Benmergui does a superb job interviewing and provoking the forces on all sides of the issue. And joking, judiciously, about the absurdity of many situations he covers. He's passionate, skeptical and a great interviewer. In this episode, he considers the plans and motives of the evangelical movement's hard-core activists.
Passionate Eye - Crash: The Next Depression? (Newsworld, 10 p.m.) is a quickly made doc - can't say by whom, there are no credits - which looks at the current economic meltdown in the U.S., and compares the situation, in detail, with the circumstances that led to the 1929 crash and the Great Depression and its immediate aftermath. There's an eerie consensus that history is being repeated. J.D.

Abstract: "After 10 years of amalgamation, I don't think any part of the city infrastructure has suffered as much as the parks," Councillor Adam Vaughan (Ward 20, Trinity-Spadina) says, echoing a view that is widely acknowledged at city hall, even within Mayor David Miller's caucus.

Full text: The ice on the rink in the park is so perfect I never see my children any more. The shinny never stops. But it's so worth it when they finally do straggle home amid a jumble of sticks and skates. Suddenly it appears: The best of all possible worlds, just as I remember it from my own blissfully frozen youth, just as every boy who ever grew up in Toronto knew it.
And it all starts in the neighbourhood park.
Some are ample, many are no more than a speck of green (in summer) or white (in winter), but they all share the same magic power. We know it's real because it has a price, expressed in the premium fetched by properties within walking distance of a prime park. Its value is something else altogether.
In the enduring best of all possible worlds, park magic would bring pride and a sense of belonging.
In Toronto today, though, it is stifled by worry about the decline and neglect of the parks themselves.
"After 10 years of amalgamation, I don't think any part of the city infrastructure has suffered as much as the parks," Councillor Adam Vaughan (Ward 20, Trinity-Spadina) says, echoing a view that is widely acknowledged at city hall, even within Mayor David Miller's caucus.
New money raised from nearby real-estate development is helping revive many downtown parks, but it does not spread very far.
Mayor Miller's Clean and Beautiful City secretariat has done a magnificent job with the planters on University Avenue, but the little parks that really matter are threadbare.
The administration's original attempt to address the problem was an outright disaster. As with so many large-scale bureaucratic enterprises managed by socialists, it began with a long round of tortuous policy-making designed to "harmonize" the existing, human-scale patchwork.
The result was a hideous tangle of rules and regulations encasing surprise fee hikes, whose documented existence the city's top parks official then denied.
That official has since left city hall to pursue other interests, and Councillor Joe Mihevc, chair of the committee that botched the job, lost his post as chair of the committee.
So what now? As an example of what works, many point to Dufferin Grove, across from the mall that shares the street's name, which a determined civic committee has rescued from bureaucratic control.
Other residents' groups are following the example, according to Mr. Vaughan, demanding a greater role in designing, maintaining and programming their local parks.
He said he is currently working with five different ad hoc committees, discussing improvements to individual green squares in Trinity-Spadina, using funds raised from development.
But when Mr. Vaughan first suggested allowing neighbourhoods to raise their own taxes to pay for improvements in local parks - just as Business Improvement Areas fund streetscape improvements with special levies on local merchants - the equity-seeking Milleristas freaked.
Other executive councillors such as Adam Giambrone and Paula Fletcher, parks committee chair, would have none of it. Undying socialism cannot endure the prospect of a "two-tier park system," with the rich feathering their own nests while the poor go parkless.
"I'm not saying the city should surrender its jurisdiction," Mr. Vaughan says.
"You need to make sure the process is inclusive, sensitive and safe. But if some neighbourhoods are willing to self-tax to fix their parks, that frees up resources in neighbourhoods that don't have the money."
If nothing else, such a scheme would help re-establish the human connections that have so withered in the new century. "You can't de-amalgamate the city, but you can decentralize it," Mr. Vaughan says.
"You can give neighbours something to do rather than something to fight."
Coming after last year's debacle, that message is no longer as seditious as it once was. Even Holy Joe Mihevc, whose constituents in Ward 21, St. Paul's West, are currently fundraising to supplement the budget for the renovation of one of their own parks, Glen Cedar, has softened.
There's nothing equitable about a status quo that links funding to nearby development, he notes. And there are huge benefits to letting citizens lead.
"That park is going to be so well cared for because they are working for it," Mr. Mihevc says, marvelling at the organization of the volunteers.
"It's not a city hall project. It's a neighbourhood project."
Hope springs eternal, even in February.

Full text: Hard times hit several all-sport radio stations in the United States recently, although it may be more accurate to say Clear Channel Communications used the economic downturn as reason to gut the stations.
At WDFN in Detroit, KLAC in Los Angeles and KLSD in San Diego, jobs were slashed and local programming replaced with a syndicated sports service.
In Toronto last week, Astral Media's CFRB, a news-talk station, laid off a handful of staff.
What will the recession mean for all-sport radio in this country?
Potential cuts, perhaps a decrease in local content and plenty of anxiety.
The markets hit hardest are Toronto and Vancouver, although sources say CTV's Team 1200 in Ottawa also is hurting. At Rogers Communications-owned The Fan 590 in Toronto and CTV's Team 1040 in Vancouver, staff reductions are not ruled out.
"I don't control Rogers, and it's status quo for now," Fan 590 vice-president and general manager Nelson Millman said. "We're not planning on any major changes, but as with any business, I suppose you adjust as you go."
Millman said everybody in radio, whether it's in music, news or sports, is hurting. "We're all operating on the same cruise ship and as the boat floats up, we all float up. And as the tide wanes a little, everybody feels it."
The Fan 590's ship set sail in September of 1992. It was the first station in Canada to move to an all-sport format. After some lean early years, the business model started to pay dividends. Anchored by Bob McCown's afternoon drive show, the station's weekly cumulative audience steadily increased.
But in market share, the percentage of radio listeners in Toronto tuned in, it's been up and down. The morning show, with Don Landry and Gord Stellick, has not improved its position. In the fall of 2008 survey, its share dropped to a 4.6 from a 5.4 in 2007.
There is a sense among some that the on-air talent has become stale. One journalist, upon returning to Toronto after several years, said, "I couldn't believe that [several personalities] were still on the air, sounding the same, saying the same things, filling the same slots."
But Millman said he believes in consistency.
"I think sometimes radio stations hurt themselves with too much tinkering," he said. "My decisions are made based on the trending of ratings over a period of time, direct audience feedback and my 37 years of experience. I think it's important for the audience to develop relationships with the on-air talent, and that takes time."
The bread and butter for all-sport radio, which targets well-to-do males 25 to 54, is automotive advertising. And the decline in that sector has been precipitous.
Millman wouldn't comment on speculation The Fan 590 is several million dollars short of its sales target.
A call to Richard Gray, who is in charge of Team 1200 in Ottawa, was not returned.
In Vancouver, revenue for radio is off by 20 per cent, a source said. In addition to auto dealership sales, real estate advertising also is down.
Robert Gray, Team 1040's program manager, said, "The challenge is keeping the station growing without getting more dollars."
He said he is hopeful staff will not be cut. "We're really focused on being as efficient as we possibly can," he said.
An additional burden for Team 1040 is a rights fee of $1.2-million the station is paying the Vancouver Canucks annually to air their NHL games.
Team 1040 overpaid for the rights to rid itself of competition from the upstart Mojo all-sport station, which changed formats after Team 1040 cut its deal with the Canucks.
But the NHL postseason is where significant dollars are earned, and the Vancouver team has underperformed. It missed the playoffs last year, and could again.
"You don't bank on them making the playoffs," Robert Gray said. "But you have a pretty strong expectation that they will more often than not."
The Ottawa Senators, carried on Team 1200, are unlikely to make it into the NHL postseason. Nor are the Toronto Maple Leafs, who are broadcast on Corus Entertainment-owned AM 640 in Toronto, a news-talk station that pays the club close to $2-million annually for radio rights.
But the news isn't bad everywhere.
Wayne Bews, the general manager of CTV's Team 990 in Montreal, said advertising sales for Quebec radio, French and English, are up slightly from a year ago.
"I was joking with one of my buddies from Alberta over the weekend," Bews said. "I said, 'We can't go into a recession in Quebec because we've been in one since 1976.' "
Radio in Alberta, which includes the Rogers-owned Fan 960 in Calgary and Astral's Team 1260 in Edmonton, also is weathering the storm, largely because of the province's petro dollars.
"It's hard to imagine putting these two provinces together," Bews said. "But Alberta and Quebec are both up in radio, while the rest of the country is down."
One advantage for radio in tough times is it offers cheap advertising relative to print and television.
Millman said, because of the nature of sport radio, it is essential to maintain local programming in the two big revenue-producing time slots, the morning and afternoon drives.
"Sports radio is a local phenomenon," he said, "And I think it's incumbent that your prime-time hours are locally focused."
But a locally produced show, counting the salary of a host and producer, costs a station $100,000 or more. A syndicated show can be bought for a few thousand.
Not surprisingly, sport radio staffers are anxious. One said he takes it day by day.
"I wake up every day, turn on the radio, and if I don't hear country music, I go into work," he said.
THE FINISH LINE
After more than 5,000 bylines in The Globe and Mail over 29 years, this is my last. I'm moving on to new pursuits. I leave with fond memories and good friendships. Thanks for reading.

Full text: Hallelujah! Councillor Kyle Rae wants to save Jarvis Street and restore it to its former elegance. Drivers are not amused
Rob McEwen's day follows a well-tuned ritual: He rises in Rosedale, boards his Lexus hybrid, then heads south on Jarvis Street toward the financial district. Although his trip takes him through some of the most congested real estate in Canada, it usually takes only 10 or 15 minutes, thanks to Jarvis's unique feature - five lanes of traffic controlled by overhead lights.
But that may be coming to an end. And Mr. McEwen isn't happy about it.
"It's coming out of the blue," he fumed this week when asked about a new city proposal that would dramatically overhaul Jarvis and eliminate the fifth lane. "I don't understand the justification."
The Jarvis makeover is the brainchild of Toronto Councillor Kyle Rae, who walks to his City Hall office and has never held a driver's licence. Mr. Rae's vision for Jarvis would reduce traffic flow and restore at least part of the street's former glory. In the 19th century, it was considered one of Toronto's most elegant boulevards.
"Back then, this was something special," Mr. Rae says. "Then it got turned into a five-lane highway. Who wants to go there now?"
He has heard his share of complaints, including one from a Rosedale dowager who told him that Jarvis was the ideal route to the Albany Club, an upper-crust hangout on King Street that was founded in 1882. The woman told him that she could make the trip in five minutes, and warned that any increase could result in the loss of her vote.
Mr. Rae says he gave her the same answer that he has to everyone else who complained about the proposed change: The trip may take slightly longer, but they'll enjoy it more. "It's going to be a better experience," he says.
Whether Mr. Rae will realize his Jarvis vision remains to be seen. Planners have prepared detailed proposals and cost estimates (about $6-million), but the project must still run a bureaucratic gauntlet before shovels go in the ground. In May, the proposal will go to the department of public works and infrastructure. If it's approved, city council has to vote on it. If the project makes it to that point, it still needs a signoff (and funding) from the province.
In the meantime, the forces of opposition are stirring. The North Rosedale Ratepayers Association, for example, has warned that killing the fifth lane will create "massive clogging" in the heart of downtown. Rosedale residents such as Mr. McEwen are angered by what they see as a lack of consultation.
"I never heard a thing about it," says Mr. McEwen, chief executive officer of a gold-exploration firm. He says he learned about the project only this week, through an e-mail from a friend, and says he expects better communications from city hall. "You don't just drop something like this on people's laps."
Whether people were given enough notice is up for debate. The city is required to notify residents by placing advertisements in local publications. In this case, the city chose Now magazine, hardly a major read in neighbourhoods like Rosedale. There have been two public meetings, one last April, and another on Jan. 22 of this year. About 250 people attended, but many residents, including Mr. McEwen, say they never heard about them.
While Jarvis Street may be a convenient thoroughfare, as a neighbourhood high street, it leaves much to be desired. In the 1960s, it underwent the civic equivalent of a bad rec-room conversion. Trees were ripped out to widen the street and make way for the fifth lane, allowing increased traffic volume. Many of the Edwardian mansions that lined the street's southern reaches were turned into rooming houses, filled with addicts and prostitutes.
City traffic planners have studied Jarvis for years, trying to figure out a way to reconcile the competing interests of traffic flow and aesthetics. The answer: You can't have both. Penelope Palmer, a senior engineer with transportation services, says the Jarvis overhaul will definitely slow down traffic, but says the trade-off will be well worth it.
"We've looked at very carefully," she says. "We realize that this is driven by human nature. People's reaction to a project is determined by how it will affect them personally."
Ms. Palmer says Jarvis carries about 1,600 vehicles an hour during peak periods. The five lanes are configured to match traffic flow, with three lanes running in one direction, and two in the other. (Jarvis is the only street in Toronto that uses this system, which is most commonly employed on bridges, including the Lions Gate in Vancouver.)
Traffic studies show that it takes an average of six to eight minutes for a vehicle to travel from Bloor to Queen Street along Jarvis. Eliminating the fifth lane will increase that time to an average of 10 to 11 minutes, Ms. Palmer says. Plans call for widening the sidewalk on the west side of the street to make way for trees, planters and street furniture. She says this will increase pedestrian traffic and encourage the opening of new businesses such as sidewalk cafes.
"We don't want to bring back the days of the horse and buggy," she says, "but we definitely want to improve the public realm."
Despite the complaints, Mr. Rae says it's full-steam ahead. He says the community that surrounds Jarvis has been undergoing a gradual renaissance, with an ever-increasing number of residences. The limiting factor, he says, is Jarvis itself. "The road needs to catch up with the neighbourhood," he says.
Councillor Adam Giambrone, who oversaw a contentious street project in his own riding (the narrowing of Lansdowne Avenue, completed last year), says disputes over street alterations follow a familiar arc. Locals get upset at the proposed change, seethe as the bulldozers go to work, then gradually come to terms with the revised street after it's completed.
The Lansdowne project ran into opposition that was, to say the least, spirited: One local chained himself to a tree, and a residents' association filed a lawsuit against Mr. Giambrone and the city, charging that the project would divert traffic onto their streets.
Mr. Giambrone says most residents now accept the changes, which have resulted in a process known as "traffic evaporation," wherein the number of cars falls following changes that increase congestion. "People adapt," he says. "They stop using their car, or they take another route. Either way, the traffic goes down."
He says a few locals are still angry, but he accepts that as the inevitable cost of change: "Few projects are ever as good, or as bad, as people think they'll be," he says. "That's the reality."

Full text: A scam's Canadian connection: When people around Phillip Robinson saw how lucrative his investments were, they wanted in. Now, the Canadian link to Bernard Madoff is becoming clear, and it isn't pretty
Phillip Robinson has survived the Second World War, the Great Depression, a broken marriage and more than a few business scrapes. Now at age 83, he has one more challenge to face - surviving Bernard Madoff.
For 20 years, Mr. Robinson believed his life savings were being well managed by Mr. Madoff's New York-based investment firm. He met Mr. Madoff in 1988 and was so impressed that he sunk $4-million into his funds over the years.
His connections to Mr. Madoff surfaced in a court filing yesterday in New York that revealed the scope of Mr. Madoff's client base in the United States and Canada. The Canadians ranged from a Montreal investment firm connected to a branch of the Bronfman family, to a Marxist scholar at Dalhousie University who once played basketball with radical socialist Abbie Hoffman, to a member of the Pencer family of soft-drink fame.
It's not clear how much each invested, and sources close to a few of them said the information was incorrect.
Mr. Madoff "was low-key, very convincing," Mr. Robinson recalled from Saint-Faustin-Lac-Carré, Que., where he runs Mont Blanc and Grey Rocks ski hills. His pitch "was so convincing. I'm still half convinced."
Mr. Robinson encouraged his two sons, daughter, brother, business partner, accountant and nephew to invest as well. Now, with Mr. Madoff facing charges of fraud in New York and allegations he ran a $50-billion (U.S) Ponzi scheme, the Robinsons have lost more than $13-million.
"I'll hang on as best I can," said Mr. Robinson, who was already coping with a bitter divorce and a struggling business before the Madoff scandal erupted. "I'm 83 and I've lived through a lot of bumps before. It's like I tell a good friend of mine, 'We wake up and we start fighting the dragons.' "
Much of the Canadian connection comes back to Mr. Robinson, whose encounter with Mr. Madoff two decades ago ultimately led to a string of investments.
It all began in Philadelphia when Mr. Robinson's old friend, Alfred Reischer, introduced him to Mr. Madoff.
Mr. Reischer owned an accounting business in Philadelphia, where Mr. Robinson went to university, and the two had kept in touch while Mr. Robinson built a career in real estate and as a local politician in New Jersey.
Mr. Robinson came to Quebec in 1976 after falling in love with skiing. He bought a ski hill, got married and settled down. Around the time Mr. Robinson married, Mr. Reischer began raving about some investments he'd made with Mr. Madoff, highlighting the steady returns of almost 12 per cent annually. Mr. Robinson was intrigued and his friend set up a meeting with Mr. Madoff.
Mr. Robinson didn't understand everything Mr. Madoff talked about that day, describing his investment strategy as a sequence of "put and call options," but he took his friend's advice and jumped in. His children, brother, nephew and business partner followed suit later.
Soon Mr. Robinson's Montreal accountant, Issie Farber, took note, too. He was doing Mr. Robinson's taxes and marvelled at the investment returns. "He saw what I was earning and he asked if he could get in," Mr. Robinson said. "So I called Mr. Madoff's secretary and I got him in."
Sources close to the Farbers say the family could be out as much as $4.5-million. Mr. Farber died several years ago and his widow, Sandra, declined to offer specifics yesterday. "I was just watching Regis & [Kelly Ripa] on television and she was saying how many people in New York, how many people in Florida [are on the list]," Ms. Farber said. "It's very sad."
At the time he invested with Mr. Madoff, Mr. Farber was a director of Cott Corp., where he was a well respected numbers man. He brought Cott executive Sam Pencer into the Madoff fold, according to the list of clients. A source close to the family estimated its losses at more than $10-million.
Mr. Pencer's widow, Judy, who lives in Toronto, declined comment and referred questions to her Montreal accountant, Barry Rashkovan.
Mr. Rashkovan is Ms. Farber's son-in-law and does some accounting work for her as well. Yesterday, he said he did not handle any investments for Ms. Pencer or Ms. Farber, and did mainly tax work. "I was not invested and the reason my name is on the list is because one of my clients was invested and I got the [Madoff fund] statements from one of my clients. I don't know how this client of mine got involved with Madoff in the first place," he said.
Mr. Robinson's daughter, Nancy, used her investments with Mr. Madoff to start a charity in Boston called Citizens for Safety, which advocates for measures to stop trafficking of illegal guns. She also relied on several Madoff clients for donations. Now she isn't sure the charity can continue.
"I'm struggling to keep my house, keep my job," Ms. Robinson said yesterday. She works full-time at the charity, which has about 1,000 members. "We just trusted that if these other individuals who were so savvy were invested then it had to be a good thing."
The other Canadians on the list were not connected to Mr. Robinson and it is not clear if they were Madoff clients or simply on a mailing list.
One was Gerbro Inc., the Montreal investment firm for the family trust of Marjorie and Gerald Bronfman. Nadine Gut, the president and chief executive officer of Gerbro, said she cannot comment on any matters relating to the company because it is a private organization. A source close to the family said Gerbro has no investments in Madoff funds and never did and that it's a mystery how its name got on the list.
Gerald Bronfman, who is deceased, was the son of Harry Bronfman, one of Seagram founder Samuel Bronfman's brothers.
Two other names were more puzzling - Herb and Ruth Gamberg, a pair of modest, left-leaning professors who came to Halifax in the 1960s and taught at Dalhousie University before they retired.
Mr. Gamberg, 75, is regarded as one of the world's leading Marxist scholars, according to a documentary about his life under development by Halifax director Walter Forsyth. He grew up in Worcester, Mass., and on his trips home from Brandeis University he would play pickup basketball with his younger friend, Abbie Hoffman, the radical social activist who comprised part of the Chicago Seven. After coming to Canada, he helped establish the Foundation Year Program at King's College, and became one of the early members of Dalhousie's sociology department, writing on everything from prison reform to socialism to the history of Nova Scotia's political left.
Although they are retired, the Gambergs remain politically energized. They added their names to a petition nominating folk singer Pete Seeger for a Nobel Peace Prize, and were among a group of signatories protesting Barrick Gold's Pascua Lama mining project in Chile.
The Gambergs could not be reached for comment yesterday.
Mr. Robinson said he doesn't feel guilty for encouraging others to invest with Mr. Madoff. "Everyone has to make their own decision," he said. "I don't blame my friends who were also getting me in."
He feels sad for the widow of his old friend Mr. Reischer, who died four years ago and put most of his money in Madoff funds. "His wife is destitute now," Mr. Robinson said quietly.
Mr. Robinson said he is coping alright with his financial woes, divorce and business troubles - he is preparing to liquidate Grey Rocks. "I still walk and still breathe and talk," he said.
When asked what he will do about the $4-million he lost with Mr. Madoff, Mr. Robinson chuckled and replied: "Wait until the grim reaper calls me, I guess."

Full text: A harrowing adventure off the coast of Bali prompts a fresh perspective on the limits of design
A month ago, I was on a commuter boat that sank in the Lombok Strait about a kilometre off the coast of Bali, Indonesia.
I and 40-odd other tourists were travelling from the island of Gili Meno to Bali when our boat struck something. We had only about five minutes to gather what we could before the 40-foot vessel went down.
I took my passport, credit cards, and reading glasses out of my backpack and put them in a small canvas purse. The boat tipped sideways and we stepped off it into the water. It took me about an hour to swim to shore. When the surf threw me up onto the beach, I was exhausted and shocked, but otherwise fine.
The accident put a few things into perspective. The usual items: working less, spending more time with loved ones, staying in better health. Perhaps not surprisingly, for the remaining fortnight of the trip I found myself circumspect and contemplative.
It may sound phony to say that a personal near-tragedy put me in mind of the differences between Balinese and Canadian approaches to interiors and architecture, when it could have put me in mind of, say, the differences in their boating-safety standards.
But the more I thought about it, the more alike those two subjects seemed.
The day after the accident, I arrived at Nick's Hidden Cottages in Ubud, a foothills town an hour inland of Denpasar, the capital. It was late afternoon. The hotel sits in a strip of rice paddies bordered by a busy street on one side and a canyon on the other.
Nick's didn't have a grand entrance, or even a paved driveway. To reach it, I walked down a narrow, raised path that wended through the rice fields. The paddies were the colour of new grass; at sunset, they reflected coral, violet, and pale pink. The air was sweet with the scent of vegetation and incense.
The thing that struck me, staying in that cottage of chiselled red brick with its hand-hewn mango-wood door, was how natural the buildings and design were. But that's not to say plain: Everywhere was breathtaking detail - on the statues and doorframes, for example. I saw this level of beauty and workmanship many places in Bali. Although intensely laboured over, Balinese design retains an essential simplicity. The place seemed unprocessed, as fresh food is unprocessed - field near to plate.
Canada, on my return, seemed more complicated and more processed - and not just for the Gyproc and big-box retailers and fluorescent lights. Vancouver is often accused of sterility, and if it's true of our broad avenues and glass towers, it may also be true of our interiors.
In Canada, we have fiercely regulated building codes, and, accordingly, ours is a legalistic approach to physical space. Two dominant dynamics seem to be at play. The first is the anticipation of problems before they occur - doing things like illuminating stairways with LED lights. The second is the way we redress problems after they occur. It's difficult to stand on a Canadian street or in a Canadian kitchen and ignore the degree to which its form is the result of litigation. Someone slips on a driveway, someone gets sued. Someone scalds himself with a kettle, someone get sued.
Back in a lounge in the raucous tourist quarter of Kuta Beach, I looked over my mojito to a sensationally angular steel staircase with a series of polished stone landings. I started counting the reasons it could never pass inspection in Canada: the open treads were a tripping hazard, for one, and the outside railing lacked sufficient vertical support. I ticked them off. In a choreographed accident, someone descending the stairs could slip beneath the railing and fall eight feet to the concrete floor below.
In Canadian design, one of the overarching concerns is What Might Happen. We have tremendously talented architects, designers, and engineers, but we don't get to see the outer limits of their creativity. Often, our homes and cities function so well we scarcely notice them.
Bali, in contrast, seems charmingly ad hoc. Alleys wide as a house at their mouth narrow inexplicably to shoulder width. The island's ubiquitous white-tiled floors are terrifyingly slippery when wet. (Presumably, people tread on them with caution.) When it rains, whole sections of sidewalk are removed to provide easy drainage for overflow. (People, I hope, don't walk into holes.)
This isn't the sentimental argument of a girl just back from holidays that Canada should be as improvised an environment as Bali is. There are aspects of that island - its beaches, which wear a fresh coat of garbage each morning; its roads, on which it's possible to drive into hot-tub-sized potholes; its air, which above the streets is thick with oil smoke and motorcycle exhaust - that could benefit from a little Canadian hypersensitivity to threat.
But if there's one thing, design-wise, I'm bringing back with me from my trip, it's not to worry about hazards. It's a renewed faith in the beauty of simple objects, natural materials and the work of human hands.
There were no fatalities or serious injuries in the sinking, and after everyone was collected, we were taken to a police station.
It was clear to many of the travellers what was to be done: apprehend negligent operators, file official reports, contact insurance companies. I felt the same way. The police appeared flustered to have a pack of angry Westerners on their hands.
Then, a well-dressed local pulled up in the flashiest car I saw on the island - a sparkling black BMW sedan with chrome wheels. Shaking the chief's hand, he took out of his pocket a thick bundle of bills. I smiled. There are problems and there are solutions, and he was the solution. It was then I said goodbye to my new friends and took my leave of the police.
Canada is designed to keep us pretty safe. And that safety has its rewards - and its costs.

Full text: TimberWest hires condominium expert in bid to earn more from land holdings
For the past two years, TimberWest Forest Corp. has talked about generating more value from its private land holdings, which amount to about 11 per cent of Vancouver Island by land mass.
Now, the company is stepping up those efforts, giving its real estate division its own name - Couverdon - and tapping Bob Rennie to help sell and develop its portfolio.
Mr. Rennie, whose name is nearly synonymous with condominium towers and whose firm is selling the financially troubled Olympic Village project in Vancouver, says Islanders should not expect a flood of high-rise, high-end developments.
"That urban luxury, one-size-fits-all market is exhausted on Vancouver Island," Mr. Rennie said in an interview this week at TimberWest's offices.
"That's really an old-economy model."
It's too early to announce what kind of projects could result from Mr. Rennie's involvement, he and TimberWest say. Couverdon may sell land outright or set up joint ventures. It could take a year or more before any deals are struck.
Mr. Rennie's role was worked out over the past few months. His company, Rennie Marketing Systems, will take on marketing, planning and design for TimberWest's real estate portfolio under the Couverdon name.
That portfolio comprises about 54,000 hectares - about 17 per cent of the 320,000 hectares of island property owned by TimberWest - that consultants in 2007 pegged as having "higher and better use" potential and includes parcels from Victoria to Campbell River.
In the past, TimberWest would on occasion sell land piecemeal. That approach won't work when the company is flogging thousands of hectares at a time.
"When you're talking about sites that might nearly wrap around a community and contain a watershed, that clearly is more than selling an acre here and an acre there," said John Hendry, TimberWest's vice-president of real estate.
"The idea that we should keep the same attitude to land in very important locations around the edges of urban centres - you can't really do it."
TimberWest no doubt hopes to tap Mr. Rennie's flair for marketing. The company in 2007 launched an on-line auction of some properties, but it wrapped up the same year with only one property being sold.
Over the past year, TimberWest has been talking to planners and councils in several communities, including Campbell River, aiming to strike deals that benefit TimberWest and gel with local land-use plans.
TimberWest is pursuing its real estate plans as the forestry industry is in a tailspin. Mills have closed and thousands of forestry workers are unemployed. Contractors who still have jobs are cutting logs, many of them from TimberWest land, that are largely being shipped out of the country for processing.
Near Victoria, a move by Western Forest Products to take its land out of tree-farm licences and sell it to a developer has resulted in a raging controversy over land use and government oversight over forestry lands. Conservation groups worry that agricultural and forestry land being swallowed up by development as a result of TimberWest land sales.
TimberWest's real estate holdings are not under tree farm licences. Although it says forestry will remain its prime business, TimberWest is recasting itself as a land-management company.
It closed its last mill, the Elk Falls sawmill in Campbell River, in May, 2008, and over the past few years moved from employee to contract logging crews.
Community-driven development could help replace some of that lost industry, says Mr. Rennie, who was overwhelmed with his first helicopter tour of the company's holdings and isn't fazed by the prospect of wading into Island politics, environmental battlefields and logging towns.
He likens it to balancing competing interests of developers and social groups in the Woodward's project, aimed at revitalizing Vancouver's Downtown Eastside, where everyone involved had passionate interest in the outcome.
"You look at the holdings of TimberWest - they own everybody's backyard," Mr. Rennie says.

In the Gulf, the truth about the economy might be found in counting cars

Abstract: The current economic recession is a moment that cries out for an Arab leader who can speak truthfully to his people on the issues of the day that really matter, including how many abandoned cars may be parked at the airport. I suspect that the chances of this happening in the emirates and sheikdoms of the Gulf are probably higher than in any other Arab region - if the Gulf's self-image of pioneering, orderly, humane national development is a fact rather than mostly an image.

Full text: Editor-at-large of the Beirut-based Daily Star
Here's my definitive litmus test for the resilience and depth of Dubai as a place that can continue to expand economically after weathering the current global economic recession: How many abandoned cars are actually parked at the Dubai airport?
In a land of superlatives and seemingly endless hyper growth, the scale of the stories circulating about the number of abandoned cars at the airport is equally gigantic. In the past few weeks in Beirut, Abu Dhabi and Dubai, I have heard friends and acquaintances report authoritatively that, variously, 15,000 or 10,000 or 6,000 cars have been parked and abandoned at the airport by their foreign owners. These people lost their jobs, did not have enough money to complete their car payments, and found the easiest way out was to park their car at the airport and leave town for good.
The variety of stories circulating about this little drama is matched by the range of reports one reads and hears in the Gulf about the real state of the local economies in Abu Dhabi, Qatar, Dubai and other emirates - from deep disaster, to a manageable two-year recession, to a simple little blip on the charts that will see economic growth only drop slightly from 9 to 6 per cent, or something of that magnitude that totally removes any impact of a global economic collapse, miraculously detouring around these enchanted lands.
The abandoned cars are a good barometer of two important dynamics: Some core, critical facts and figures about their economies are simply not known to the public, but at least the gap in verifiable data is bridged by splendid rumours.
Foreign and local investors need to know the truth about these economies that have grown so impressively, in large part due to surplus oil wealth shifting into speculative investments in real-estate projects. If investors have doubts about the economic facts of these sheikdoms and emirates, they will quickly send their money to other markets where the facts are known. Investors do not mind bad news about economic losses or retrenchment. What they despise and fear is being left in the dark about economic realities.
Also, providing accurate, verifiable information about the realities of the economic downturn in the Gulf may be the first major "political" test these countries face in modern times. They can cement relations between citizens and their state on the basis of something more enduring than short-term materialism. If they can speak honestly to their own citizens and provide them with a clear, comprehensive picture of current conditions and expected trends, they will have enriched the entire Arab world with an example of true pioneering development and state-building that is much more meaningful than a shopping mall or a Hummer showroom.
We need one Arab government - just one - that will react to the global and regional economic recession by speaking the truth to its people, disclosing real unemployment rates, debt buyouts, contraction or expansion trends, and other such things. I have not seen such an example to date, but I suspect that the first Arab government that musters the courage to speak honestly will reap a reward of rare and incalculable proportions: the trust of its people.
I would like to hear one sheik, emir, king, sultan, president-for-life, or wise and vanguard-beloved leader of the dazed and pulverized masses explain the true extent of the crisis that is upon us, and ask for citizen participation in weathering the storm and generating ideas for coming out of it in decent shape.
The various emirates throughout the Gulf region that have grown at breakneck speed in the past three decades are having to adjust to supply-and-demand economic realities after living through nearly four decades in which they thought that they operated by different rules.
These statelets have enjoyed sufficient income to keep their citizens living happily for the most part, and also to offer jobs to millions of guest workers, while generating spectacular speculative investment opportunities for all those who dared to gamble. Now that the speculative bubble has burst, citizens, guest workers and rootless investors alike need some accurate news about just how bad or manageable things really are.
Anybody can be a popular leader by offering endless commercial contracts when the oil wealth is flowing non-stop. But only real leaders succeed when times are hard, oil income is down and economies are shrinking, and they maintain their credibility by telling their people the truth about the difficult times.
The current economic recession is a moment that cries out for an Arab leader who can speak truthfully to his people on the issues of the day that really matter, including how many abandoned cars may be parked at the airport. I suspect that the chances of this happening in the emirates and sheikdoms of the Gulf are probably higher than in any other Arab region - if the Gulf's self-image of pioneering, orderly, humane national development is a fact rather than mostly an image.

Living it up at the Hotel Continental

Author: McLaren, Leah

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/living-up-at-hotel-continental/docview/382664558/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Yet, from the inside, there is something unsettling about this hotel, with its cavernous rooms, carved-wood ceilings and cheap semi-gloss vases full of carnations and cabbages. In the evenings, bats swoop from the eaves outside my window, gobbling insects in the smog. Frommer's dismisses it as "an aging cathouse" and, while I didn't come here for luxury but to commune with the ghost of my literary hero, I have to agree.

Full text:   When I ask the local girl selling books on the street corner in Saigon if she has any copies of Graham Greene's The Quiet American, she jumps up from the curb and smiles. "You watch my books?" she asks, indicating a pile of dog-eared Lonely Planet Guides (Laos, Thailand, Cambodia) bound together with twine. I tell her sure and she spins off around the corner, skinny legs flying, returning 10 minutes later with a slim, shrink-wrapped Penguin Classic, for which I pay her the extortionate price of $8 (U.S.).
I haven't read The Quiet American (or any Greene for that matter) since university, when I went through a seriously pretentious phase of drinking neat scotch while imagining myself sweltering under a mosquito net in a war zone. Thankfully it didn't last long. I was, after all, a 20-year-old English lit major, not a middle-aged lapsed Catholic with a dead marriage back in England and a penchant for "local colour." Still, The Quiet American , which tells the story of a group of expatriates in Saigon before America's involvement in the Vietnam War, was my favourite. I remember it as cynical, brilliant, astonishingly prescient and, frankly, a lot fatter than this skinny little volume in my hand.
Back in my room at the Hotel Continental, where most of the events in the novel take place, I pull a carved rosewood chair out on to the crumbling balcony overlooking the Saigon Opera House and remove the plastic wrap. The book, as it turns out, is a pirated copy. It appears to have been photocopied onto newsprint and bound into a rudimentary facsimile of the iconic Penguin Classic cover, its text shrunk even smaller than the diminutive original and running cockeyed on the page.
For a moment, I feel badly that Greene's estate is not getting royalties and consider chucking the book army of motorbikes below. But then I think: What would Thomas Fowler, the novel's cynical, opium-addicted British war-correspondent hero, do? And the feeling passes.
I take a swallow of Saigon beer and begin reading. Suddenly I am in the grip of Greene fever all over again. I love this town and its chilled-out take on chaos - the carts of dried squid and families of five hanging nonchalantly off a single motorbike. I wish I had a concubine to bring me my opium pipe. I wish I had the urge to see a priest.
Greene, after all, is the reason I came to the Continental in Saigon (officially known as Ho Chi Minh City). While booking a cheap beach cottage on an island in the south, I came across several travel websites that said he had lived here (in Room 214 or 210, depending on whom you believe) and, on the spur of the moment, booked myself in for a couple of nights just to see what it was like.
If Greene's (now somewhat hackneyed) prewar vision of Vietnam as a beautiful, unobtainable and tragically misunderstood woman is to be believed, the Hotel Continental adds another seedier layer to the vision.
Much older and more affordable than its opulent colonial cousin - the Majestic - down the street, the Continental is an elegant whitewashed building on a main square of Dong Khoi and the city's pre-eminent historic colonial landmark.
And yet, from the inside, there is something unsettling about this hotel, with its cavernous rooms, carved-wood ceilings and cheap semi-gloss vases full of carnations and cabbages. In the evenings, bats swoop from the eaves outside my window, gobbling insects in the smog. Frommer's dismisses it as "an aging cathouse" and, while I didn't come here for luxury but to commune with the ghost of my literary hero, I have to agree.
It clearly has been a while since the American press corps ("noisy, boyish and middle-aged, full of sour cracks," as Greene unfondly remembers them) gathered in this deserted courtyard bar to gossip and drink, but, amazingly, none of the staff remembers the author - or his legacy. When I hold up the cover of the book, the lady at the front desk smiles blankly and shakes her head in confusion.
I go upstairs to my lair, take out my laptop and go to Literarytourist.com, a reputable website, to settle the debate once and for all. "Built in 1928, the Majestic Hotel offered opulence much closer to the life Greene enjoyed as a wealthy and famous novelist than to the seedy back alley rooms inhabited by Tom Fowler, Greene's protagonist in The Quiet American ," the website reads. "Perhaps Greene liked the Majestic because he was safely insulated from the dangers of the street."
The same street, ironically, where young girls are now selling illegal copies of Greene's own novel. And then there's me. A misguided literary tourist, longing to taste the authentic Saigon of my feverish imagination, yet even on my nerdy quest, unable to afford the real thing.
Does it even matter whether my hero set a battered Oxford in the Continental, so long as his imagination did? As a writer, isn't it the perception of place that I'm after, rather than the replication of history itself?
I take another Saigon beer from the mini fridge and step out on the crumbling balcony, overlooking the street where, just as in 1955, "the girls in white silk trousers bicycled home down the Rue Catinat." Then I remember: It's now called Dong Khoi.
This creaky old hotel may not have been good enough for Greene, but it's good enough for me. It's got to be. It might be Vietnam but I still can't afford the Majestic.

Full text:   With the spotlight on Loblaws and its moment of pesky infamy, all eyes are on the city's vermin population
If dog is man's best friend, rat is the friend that drops in uninvited and just won't leave. And it likes dim sum.
In the past two years, more than a third of Toronto restaurants and grocery stores fined for pest infestations and then closed by the city's public-health inspectors have been located in Chinatown.
How it became a rodent hot spot is a chicken-or-the-egg dilemma.
By all estimates, the area surrounding the intersection of Spadina Avenue and Dundas Street is a prime slice of rodent real estate. Large, open grocery stores, small crowded restaurants, crumbling buildings and aging infrastructure offer all the basic amenities essential to a small, furry, mammalian scavenger lifestyle.
But the heavy infestation discovered in a Loblaws grocery store near the Annex suggests the problem may be pervasive throughout the city, and supports the argument that increased scrutiny in the wake of a few high-profile sightings has sealed Chinatown's reputation as a rodent haven.
After a lengthy cleaning process that was lauded by health officials as "very thorough," the Loblaws grocery will likely re-open for business Monday. But, like Chinatown, it will likely suffer from a lingering "ick" factor.
Rats can gnaw through concrete, spread dangerous bacteria through their excrement, and viruses through their fleas. The inventory of diseases they can spread includes salmonella, E. coli and bubonic plague.
Mice are less destructive but equally infectious; their feces carry potentially fatal hantaviruses that can infect human lungs upon close contact. Unfortunately, their small size and affinity for the indoors means they often scamper amongst us, and our fresh produce, undetected.
And those squirmy, scaly pink tails are just plain gross.
In the age of cellphone cameras and YouTube, few nibblers go unnoticed, and their images are often shared with a few thousand friends. (Footage of nearly two dozen rats frolicking through a joint Taco Bell and KFC store in Manhattan has been viewed by millions.)
In February of last year, photographs of rats scurrying about floured countertops inside Dumpling House on Spadina Avenue were posted on a local news blog. Then, in October, a large rat was photographed only a few doors away, in the window of Happy Seven Restaurant, perched beside a Toronto Public Health inspection "pass" sign. That rat was also featured on the blog.
"This is a natural situation. Where you have people, you have rats," said Victor Wong, executive director of the Chinese Canadian National Council, whose offices are located in the heart of Chinatown. "If you applied the same level of scrutiny in other areas where there are food markets and restaurants, you would find very similar results."
The Loblaws infestation is not the first one in its neighbourhood to achieve infamy. In 2000, a pair of passersby photographed mice nibbling through the cellophane of sandwiches inside the Shakespeare Café, west of Spadina Avenue on Bloor Street West. The pictures were published in this newspaper, and the café was closed by health inspectors a short time later.
And yet, pest-control-related closures remain relatively rare in that part of the city.
A few blocks south, a long, narrow store in Kensington Market, Cheese Magic, filled with teetering towers of creamy brie and tart cheddars, was closed last year when inspectors found evidence of a rodent incursion, among other infractions. The owner, Ping Chiu, said inspectors found small amounts of mouse poop within the walls of the 100-year-old building her store has occupied for more than two decades.
In the years since the city reduced garbage collection from twice a week to once a week, she has been engaged in an endless battle to keep furry scavengers from infiltrating her store. "It's hard to prevent that because there's always holes and cracks in the building - in all the buildings around here," she said.
Ms. Chiu pays an exterminator to visit her store once a month, and for a private company to collect her garbage four times a week. But human scavengers riffle through her recycling and steal her garbage bags, leaving piles of waste in the streets beckoning to the pests she devotes so much effort to trying to expel.
Though she believes that Chinatown's reputation is somewhat deserved, Ms. Chiu also feels it has become exaggerated by public health's increased scrutiny.
The chances of becoming ill after eating at an establishment that has become infested are "fairly low," said Greg Baumann, vice-president and senior scientist for the National Pest Management Association.
Rats "have a tendency to collect near humans because we provide them with everything they need," he said. "Because they are so efficient and such a well-designed tool, they also make a formidable enemy."
There are, however, success stories. While the house mouse, M us musculus ,has been just as successful as we have at spreading and populating the Earth, there are two parts of the world that are nearly entirely rat-free: Antarctica and Alberta. The former benefits from a frigid climate and tiny human population, while the later has implemented a more militant approach.
The species of rat that frequents our grocery stores, Rattus norvegicus , or the brown rat, is not native to North America. It landed with settlers on the east coast near the end of the 18th century and began a migration west. By the time the first brown rats reached the western border of Saskatchewan in the early 1950s, the Albertans were ready for them.
More than 63,000 kilograms of arsenic trioxide were spread over farms and buildings between Medicine Hat and Provost, between 1952 and '53, according to an Alberta agriculture report.
The Rocky Mountains to the west and an army of pest-control inspectors in municipalities to the east have helped keep the province nearly rat-free. Rats are illegal either as pets or as pet food in Alberta, and the penalty for keeping them is a $5,000 fine. Laboratory rats, domesticated descendants of the brown rat, can, however, be kept by zoos, universities, colleges and research institutions.
By international standards, Toronto's rodent problem remains relatively minor. Some estimate New York City may be populated by as many rats as it is humans.
One way to be doubly sure your favourite takeout restaurant is rodent-free is to stroll by at night and peer in the window.
Be sure to bring a camera.
***
Chinatown is not the only hot spot
Far from the narrow streets of Chinatown, many establishments have been caught with heavy or chronic pest infestations. And the list of offenders can be surprising.
Signs of an infestation alone are usually not enough for a health inspector to close a restaurant, but the infestation uncovered at The Keg Steakhouse and Bar at 927 Dixon Rd. in Etobicoke last year was deemed critical, and the restaurant was closed immediately.
Two inspections at the Double Choc Donut Bakery on Garyray Drive in North York last year revealed evidence of infestations. The store was closed in February, 2008, but received a conditional pass on an inspection earlier this month because of inadequate pest-control methods.
A Manchu Wok food-court vendor on The West Mall in Etobicoke was closed and fined $1,125 in March of 2007 after evidence of a serious insect infestation was uncovered. The vendor was fined again in April, 2008, for inadequate pest-control methods, but received a full pass when health inspectors visited again last week.
Perhaps most alarming is the number of sushi restaurants that have been closed in the past 18 months with pest control-related infractions. Sushi Star Restaurant on Spadina Avenue, Sakura on McCaul Street, and Yonge Ichiban Sushi on Finch Avenue East have all been shuttered for brief periods by public-health inspectors.

Full text:   For more than a decade, Spain's economy was one of the most dynamic in Europe. La reina de la fiesta created one-third of all jobs in the euro zone, its growth fuelled by consumption and a sustained boom in the construction sector. Barcelona was the new Paris, its gastronomy, design and architecture full of bravado and elegance.
But when the real estate bubble burst and the global economic crisis hit, the fifth-largest economy in Europe suddenly became one of the most troubled.
The country now faces its deepest recession in 50 years. The Bank of Spain released figures this week showing a fall in economic output in the last two quarters, and forecasting a 2-per-cent contraction for 2009. There are as many as 800,000 unsold homes on the market, and unemployment is at 14 per cent, expected to hit 20 per cent by 2011.
Some analysts wonder whether being tied to a single euro zone monetary policy will hamper the country's ability to recover. The Spanish government cannot devalue its currency or lower interest rates to stimulate growth.
Instead, it is hamstrung by the European Central Bank, which recently dropped interest rates by half a percentage point to 2 per cent. The ECB, however, ruled out another cut yesterday, even as the International Monetary Fund called for further action and predicted economic activity would contract by 2 per cent in the euro zone.
Europe's other large economies are also struggling. Germany posted unemployment of 8.3 per cent yesterday, and in France, where unemployment is 9.8 per cent, an estimated one million workers marched to protest President Nicolas Sarkozy's handling of the crisis.
But Spain, which has had above-average growth for the last decade, has fallen fastest and farthest. This week, on the popular TV show I have a Question for you , Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero urged viewers to consume local goods and said the economy isn't just about money but is a state of mind.
"Our unemployment is higher because most of our growth was in construction and those workers are harder to re-employ. Our economy isn't as competitive as France and Germany so it's harder for us to export," said Emiliano Carluccio, who puts out the Bulletin of Inflation and Macro-economic Analysis at Madrid's Carlos III University.
Some political commentators are now suggesting that Spain, as well as Greece, may face internal pressure to abandon the euro as their currency. The Maastricht Treaty, which established the single currency in 1999, contains no legal route for a country to leave the euro, but that doesn't mean it couldn't happen.
The chattering classes in Spain aren't, however, lobbying to go back to the peseta. Spain has been the single largest beneficiary of the European Union, receiving $245-billion (U.S.) over the last decade. (The country helps form the acronym PIGS, along with Portugal, Italy and Greece, for the resources they have soaked up.) If Spain devalued its currency, its foreign debt would increase in real terms by at least 20 per cent and it would likely default. "It is completely crazy and nobody is considering this possibility," Mr. Carluccio says.
Barry Eichengreen, an economist at the University of California at San Francisco, says monetary union is harder when the shocks hitting the member economies are asymmetric. "When times were good, nobody ever said 'it's bad to be in the euro zone.' "
The British experience shows how a national currency and monetary policy can help an economy adjust. Facing the effects of a global recession and a burst housing bubble, the Bank of England cut interest rates to the lowest level ever, 1.5 per cent. The pound has also dropped in value to below parity against the euro, which will help British exports.Spain's vulnerability also relates to its lack of productivity. It is the only country in the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development where productivity fell between 1991 and 2005, largely owing to its labour-intensive tourism and construction sectors. The construction sector accounted for 9 per cent of the country's gross domestic product - twice as big a share as in other big European countries - and tourism, 11 per cent. The country should focus on structural reforms, invest in secondary education, and diversify into value-added sectors, Mr. Carluccio said.
Spain's current-account deficit is roughly equivalent to 10 per cent of its GDP, which means the country is consuming more foreign goods and services than it is selling.

Why sexy veggies and girly gridiron games get bumped

Full text:   Serious news today: The Lingerie Bowl has been cancelled.
The producers of the event, Lingerie Bowl VI, which was expected to air as a pay-per-view special during halftime at this Sunday's Super Bowl, failed to agree terms with a suitable venue this year. If I understand correctly, the Lingerie Bowl was scheduled to take place at a clothing-optional section of Caliente Resorts in Florida, but there was a helluva ruction about the appropriateness of holding an event that involved women wearing skimpy clothes at a place that's a haven for people wearing no clothes at all. A matter of principle, and all that.
The nail in coffin for Lingerie Bowl VI came when Caliente Resorts issued this statement: "Caliente is a luxury clothing-optional resort. We ran into conflicts with the Lingerie Football League wanting more areas of our resort restricted to clothing required than we could accommodate." See, the lingerie-clad players were uncomfortable doing their thing surrounded by fellas who are buck naked. That's the gist.
Mind you, it's easy to read the reality behind this baloney. If there was a real demand for Lingerie Bowl VI, it would be airing as usual. Obviously, there isn't.
Meanwhile, NBC has declined to air a commercial made for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) during the Super Bowl. The commercial, which I have seen and enjoyed, is definitely "pro-veggie," as it is described in news reports. It has been pulled from the broadcast by NBC Universal's advertising standards department because it "depicts a level of sexuality exceeding our standards." The brief ad, which was intended to carry the slogan: "Studies Show Vegetarians Have Better Sex," involves lingerie-clad models showing their enthusiasm for vegetables. One sequence shows an actress rubbing her pelvic area with a pumpkin. What she does with asparagus is even more interesting. NBC says it couldn't possibly air this material. PETA says, "PETA's veggie ads are locked out, while ads for fried chicken and burgers are allowed, even though these foods make Americans fat, sick and boring in bed."
Again, it's possible to see the real story here - a cash-strapped NBC is nervous about lurid footage of lingerie-clad ladies having their way with vegetables. It won't take the dough for the sexy veggie spot.
People, I put it to you that these two news items from the TV racket are signs of the new seriousness that is part and parcel of the current economic apocalypse. On the day that Barack Obama was elected, I pointed out that a new seriousness was supposed to wash over the United States, like a sobering acid rain after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. And it never happened then, or in the years after. Instead, the frivolity increased. All that coverage of Paris Hilton and reality TV series about well-known floozies and flibbertigibbets. Seriousness was not the option chosen.
Now, on the cusp of that culture-defining event in the U.S., the Super Bowl, here it comes. The U.S. popular culture gets a makeover. As it must. There has been giddy optimism about the Obama era, but the economy is on the brink of ruin. The present is funereal and the future is indistinct and unsettling. The time for responsibility and obligation is now. The time of the floozies has passed. The seriousness is here.
Members of the heterosexual male species in the U.S. will be obliged to drool over lingerie-clad models while looking at the undergarments section of the Sears catalogue. It's the Great Depression all over again. Serious news.
The Week the Women Went (CBC, 8 p.m.) is not something I can tell you much about. The advance DVD of tonight's episode carries only the sound of the aye-tiddly-aye theme music. No dialogue or voice-over can be heard. Perhaps this is a new CBC gimmick: "Viewers: Guess what the people are saying!" Anyway, far as I can gather, the second season of the series, which began last week, chronicles what happens when 200 wives, mothers, sisters and daughters pull out of Tatamagouche, N.S., for a week of pampering at a resort in New Brunswick. The men have to do the domestic stuff: the chores, the kids. Last year's series, set in a small Alberta town, was deeply depressing about the awfulness of men.

Also airing tonight
AMERICAN IDOL (Fox, CTV, 8 p.m.) is something we need to keep an eye on - news has broken that Simon Cowell has been cursed by a witch doctor after she was voted off during the first-round auditions of the similar show Britain's Got Talent .
THE FIFTH ESTATE (CBC, 9 p.m.) is really, really racy this week. Hana Gartner casts a cold eye on online, virtual adultery. Apparently, one of the great social ills of our time is Second Life, an Internet fantasy game that allows users to create a fantasy version of themselves, meet others and socialize, travel or engage in romance. Gartner introduces us to two women, "ordinary suburban moms" who fell in love with their fantasy life and lovers. If fact, they abandoned their families to meet the man behind their fantasies. You can find out if the real thing measured up.
WILD DOCS: JELLYFISH
Invasion (Newsworld, 10 p.m.) is all about that curse of the beach holiday, the jellyfish. See, they live in every ocean on the globe, thriving in both the Arctic and the tropics. Yes, the jellyfish populations are on the rise. The program exposes the crisis.

$1.3-billion shake-up rocks chilled-out Snowmass

Author: Knowles, Lori

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/1-3-billion-shake-up-rocks-chilled-out-snowmass/docview/382673615/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Snowmass's grandness continues, with its streams of mogul runs on the ski area's west side at Campground and Sam's Knob, to the east at the intermediate Elk Camp, and above The Burn along what's called The Cirque.

Full text:   Drop down on Runway 15 on a sunny day at the Aspen/ Pitkin County Airport and four Colorado ski mountains will be gleaming before you like the jewels on a wealthy Aspenite's fingers. Aspen Mountain (Ajax) is there to the east, with its sleek, double-black-diamond peaks and one of the world's chicest towns at its feet. Aspen Highlands is to the southeast, with its retro runs, pounding bumps, and posse of hard-driving locals. Buttermilk is nearly due south with its green circle strollers and rock 'n' roll terrain parks. And there, to the southwest, lounging lazily in the sun is Snowmass, the most chilled-out of them all.
Broad, rolling, dotted with groves of glittering aspen trees, Snowmass has always offered a vibe different to its three more frenzied Aspen siblings. Absent have been the flashbulbs of Aspen Mountain's paparazzi, the tumult of Buttermilk's parks 'n pipes - home to the Winter XGames - and the incessant fear inspired by the Highlands' steep slopes. Instead, Snowmass opens its cushioned arms wide to welcome you and rocks you into relaxation with its seamless lifts - including an $8.8-million super chair new this season - its ski-in/ski-out accommodation, and its moderate pistes. It has always taken visiting skiers, regardless of their ability or the heft of their wallets, about two seconds to feel right at home on this unpretentious, pillow-comfortable mountain.
Not much has rocked Snowmass's relaxed world for nearly 40 years, until this season. When the chairlift bullwheels started turning in December, a $1.3-billion addition to the Snowmass base made its debut - 100 new ski-in/ski-out residences, a handful of upscale restaurants and nightclubs at the base of Fanny Hill which, frankly, threaten to shake up Snowmass' notoriously sleepy disposition.
The village expansion has been rocky and years in the making. Those who valued Snowmass' quiet and lack of pretence fought the changes. Canada's currently troubled Intrawest Corp. took the lead on the project with partner Aspen Skiing Co. (ASC) early in this decade, only to sell out abruptly in 2006 to Related WestPac, one of the largest private real estate companies in the U.S. By the time of the sale, Intrawest had alienated those Aspen locals who strenuously opposed the size, height and density of Intrawest's development plans and what they called the company's "penny-pinching." After paying a reported $208-million, Related WestPac forged ahead with Intrawest's intentions, anyway. Its first condominiums at Hayden Lodge and Capitol Peak Lodge are now open. While WestPac has plans to drop another $2.5-billion on two more Snowmass neighbourhoods by 2011, some projects were suspended last fall due to the credit crunch.
Through it all the company has held fast its commitment to creating what it calls "environmentally-conscious and pedestrian-oriented, smart-growth designs." ASC's Aspen/Snowmass resort is certified as a green company - the first of only two ski resorts in the U.S. to achieve this recognition (the other is Jackson Hole, Wyoming). And it is the only snow-sport resort in the country to have a green building policy. As a result, WestPac endeavoured to have these additional buildings certified by the U.S. Green Building Council. Planners have incorporated bike paths, walkways and a gondola into the design to cut down on vehicular traffic and building products will consist of 20 per cent recycled material.
The designs are decidedly sleek - a style WestPac calls "mountain-modern." Most buildings will be green certified, including The Little Nell five-star residence opening in 2010, and the Viceroy Hotel.
All this money and the hullabaloo of development has not changed the feel of skiing Snowmass. Mercifully, the mountain's bones are still intact.
Despite its size - 1,268 skiable hectares, 1,343-metre vertical drop all served by more than 20 lifts - it doesn't take long to figure out how best to ski the mountain. Elk Camp. Sam's Knob. Campground. The Big Burn. Like a handful of cards, they're fanned out easily before you at the start of each day. Up one lift, down an easy piste, up another lift and into some trees. Pop out, slide over a snowbridge and into some well-padded bumps. Before you know it, it's time for lunch.
Most skiers' introduction to Snowmass is Fanny Hill, a beginner slope kids and newbies to Aspen learn to ski on. Fanny Hill's multi-coloured sky cabs - kids call them The Skittles - move people up and down this easy slope, accessing the condos that scale steadily up its borders. From Fanny Hill, skiers can ascend higher on a series of high-speed chairlifts to the peak at 3,813 metres - one of the highest lift-served points in Colorado's Rockies.
Up there, the Big Burn is the ski area's most easily-accessible, big mountain run. The Burn is vast swaths of wide-open skiing, with the odd pod of low-rise evergreens scattered about which, like slalom gates, give you something to ski around. Its sparseness was caused by a massive fire in the 1880s which, depending who you talk to, was sparked either by Ute Indians trying to drive out white settlers, or the other way around. Either way, at this altitude, the trees have been extremely slow to grow back, leaving an impressive stretch of piste so broad that in a week you likely won't ski the same path twice.
Snowmass's grandness continues, with its streams of mogul runs on the ski area's west side at Campground and Sam's Knob, to the east at the intermediate Elk Camp, and above The Burn along what's called The Cirque. The latter is a ring of above-treeline, powder-filled, double-black diamond steeps with curious names like Hang On and AMF (Adios My Friend). In a good snow year - Snowmass' annual average snowfall is 762 centimetres - the skiing along these headwalls ranks up there with Whistler/Blackcomb's expert fare. Endless runs into the tightly-knit Hanging Valley Glades - with maverick names like The Edge and Free Fall - can fill in overnight with dry, chest-deep snow and give you the ride of your life after avalanche blasting in the morning.
What's nearly unmatchable, though, is Snowmass's cheery weather. It's typical for storms to sweep into Aspen's valleys at night, dump snow, then blow out by morning. The sky can smile an innocent blue by 10 a.m. after a vicious night, leaving skiers to ride the powder in the sunshine.
Back at its newly expanded base, the jury's still out on the effect of the addition of several swank new hotels. On the one hand, more choice of lodging may mean more affordable accommodation; Snowmass' unique ski-in/ski-out accommodation has always been highly in-demand and rarely deal-friendly. On the other hand, more lodging means more people, which would translate into more skiers on the mountain's typically and blissfully calm terrain.
What's for certain, however, is the continuation of the ease and variety of Snowmass runs. Slap your boards on at the bottom of Fanny Hill, ride the gondola over to Elk Camp or a chair to the top of Sam's Knob and you'll be treated to the same effortless, pillow-soft skiing riders have experienced here for decades. Forget the blinding glint off those well-polished jewels and the designer duds you spotted in the ritzy town of Aspen. The pistes of Snowmass will continue to ski more like your grandpa's big leather chair, with its warm supple feel, rolling expanse and faint hint of pipe smoke.

Full text:   Big-box retailer Home Depot has cancelled its long-held dream of a downtown store - to the delight of some local critics - but talks are already under way for other tenants for the mixed-use development at Queen and Portland streets.
"We determined it was not the right time for us to open," Home Depot manager of public relations Tiziana Baccega said yesterday. "We would have loved to have been there."
Despite Home Depot's pullout, developer RioCan Real Estate Investment is confident construction is on track for a project that features a five-storey residential component over three storeys of retail.
"We should still be able to start by late spring, pending the finalization of leasing we are working on," said Fred Waks, chief operating officer of RioCan, the largest real-estate investment trust in Canada.
"We are very pleasantly surprised as to the amount of interest we have on the site," he said. "There is not a national grocery store that has not contacted us in the last 24 hours."
He confirmed that Home Depot paid $11.5-million to terminate its lease for 75,000 square feet of space.
RioCan already has tenants for about 16,000 square feet, with a major grocery store and other retailers as candidates for the former Home Depot space. Mr. Waks expects to wrap up negotiations with new retail tenants in two to three months.
Tribute Communities, RioCan's partner for the 90-unit condominium, has sold 55 units (or 61 per cent of the project).
An early critic of Home Depot's plans for a downtown spot said yesterday she is "relieved" that a suburban-style home improvement centre is no longer in the works.
"It was the wrong end-user for that neighbourhood," said Kristyn Wong-Tam, who owns XEXE Gallery on nearby Richmond Street and lives in the area. She hopes RioCan will seek out smaller-scale retailers, including a food store and boutique-style tenants.
Councillor Adam Vaughan (Ward 20, Trinity-Spadina), worried about the chilling effects of the downturn, said "construction isn't halted and that is the most critical thing for that stretch of Queen Street."

Full text:   Town awaits impact assessments
The New York Islanders and owner Charles Wang are trying a familiar squeeze play in hopes of pushing through a massive real-estate project that includes a rebuilt arena - but local politicians say they are bound by law not to rush their approval.
The Islanders owner and his partner, real-estate developer Scott Rechler, want to rebuild Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum and build a sports, entertainment, business and housing project on 100 acres around the arena. It is estimated the development would be worth between $3-billion and $4-billion (U.S.).
The project was approved by Nassau County but cannot proceed until the Town of Hempstead signs off - which might only happen after a long series of studies of the environmental, health and other impacts of the project.
Wang, who wants to break ground on the project this summer, turned up the heat on the town last week, when the Islanders announced they will play a preseason game next September at the Sprint Center in Kansas City. Kansas City officials are aggressively lobbying for an NHL team to play in their new arena.
Wang did not come out and say the game was a test of the Kansas City market. But there was no shortage of anonymous team sources in the local media who did.
The Islanders also announced they will hold the first eight days of their 2009-10 training camp in Saskatoon. They will play two preseason games at Credit Union Centre on Sept. 19 against the Calgary Flames and Sept. 20 against the Edmonton Oilers. However, it is not unusual for NHL teams to hold part of their training camps in other cities.
NHL commissioner Gary Bettman called out Hempstead politicians on his satellite radio show last week. But town officials say nothing can be rushed. At present, the project is in the middle of environmental-impact studies.
Kate Murray, the supervisor and chief executive officer of Hempstead, said yesterday that Wang and Bettman can make all the noise they want about moving the team but it will not speed up the process.
Murray said rushing the project to approval "would suggest that I would be willing to break state laws to circumvent the environmental processes that by law we must go through."
Murray said she told Wang several times over the past five years that if he would proceed with the arena redevelopment first it could be approved quickly. Then the approval for the rest of the project could follow at its own pace.
As an existing building, the Coliseum would not require a long study for environmental, health and traffic concerns. But new projects do and this is where the process slows down, even though the county issued its approval a few years ago.
Wang did not respond to a request for comment, but an Islanders spokesman said the owner cannot proceed until he receives approval for the entire project. Wang says the only way he can recoup the money he is losing on the Islanders - reportedly approaching $20-million a year - is through the profits on the entire project.
"That is a business decision [Wang] made," Murray said. "Sometimes there is a feeling among hockey fans that somehow I am delaying this. But because he chose to tie the arena development to the real-estate development, he has to live with the time frame.
"He knows it and he is making that decision."
Town officials also point out that even though Wang was approved as the developer of the site by Nassau County in 2001, he never submitted an official request to develop the land with the county until 2005. Hempstead did not receive its official application from Wang until December of 2007.
Murray said she cannot give an estimate of how long all of the necessary approvals will take because several local and state agencies are involved. Wang hoped to start this summer, but his supporters now think he will be lucky to break ground in 2010.

Full text:   Neil Moody thought Arthur Nadel was such a decent guy he not only went into business with Mr. Nadel but also gave him roughly $12-million (U.S.) to invest.
So when Mr. Nadel didn't show up for work at his office in Sarasota, Fla., on Wednesday, Mr. Moody got worried. Within hours, Mr. Nadel's family found an apparent suicide note and alerted police. The next day police located Mr. Nadel's green Subaru at the Sarasota airport.
Since then, the FBI and the Securities and Exchange Commission have joined local police in trying to find Mr. Nadel and figure out what happened to the roughly $350-million he managed through his company, Scoop Management Inc.
"He has disappointed a lot of people," Mr. Moody said yesterday in an interview from his Sarasota residence. "As far as I know he's still at large and believed to be somewhere in the U.S."
Mr. Nadel, 75, is the third investment fund manager in seven months to vanish after leaving a suicide note.
Last June, hedge fund manager Samuel Israel disappeared the day he was supposed to report to prison to begin serving a 20-year sentence for a $400-million fraud. Police found his car on a bridge about 90 kilometres north of New York City with the words "suicide is painless" written in dust on the hood. Police arrested his girlfriend, who confessed she helped Mr. Israel pack a camper with belongings and a motor scooter. Mr. Israel spent about three weeks in a campground in Massachusetts and then surrendered to local police, driving up to the station on the scooter.
Earlier this month, Indiana investment adviser Marcus Schrenker jumped out of an airplane over Alabama in an apparent fake suicide attempt. He sped away on a motorcycle that he had previously stashed, but was found at a campground in Florida. Mr. Schrenker faces several lawsuits alleging he owes investors and others more than $9-million.
While it's not clear what has happened to Mr. Nadel, Mr. Moody and others say he was a pillar of the local community.
He and his wife, Peg, donated to a wide variety of causes, including Habitat for Humanity and the local YMCA, which has said it had $1.1-million invested with Mr. Nadel. Last weekend, the couple attended a gala fundraising event at Circus Sarasota, which runs educational programs for children in addition to putting on performances.
Mr. Nadel, a lawyer by training, was a real estate developer in New York before moving to Florida in the 1990s. There are reports he ran into legal problems in New York and was disbarred.
He and Ms. Nadel started Scoop in 1999. Mr. Moody worked with Mr. Nadel since 1999 and he said there was no indication anything was wrong until last Wednesday. In fact, investors routinely received statements showing annual returns of between 8 and 12 per cent.
"He didn't show up and his wife came into the office around 11 expecting him to be there and he wasn't," Mr. Moody said. "My family is out a minimum of $12-million."
On Saturday, Mr. Nadel's family released a statement saying Ms. Nadel and other employees of Scoop "have just learned that they, along with many others who have invested money with Art, have been victimized by his unauthorized actions."
The family added that it is co-operating with police.

Full text: New York apartment buildings are like Russian families: The happy ones are all alike, but as Tolstoy might have written if he lived amid the economic plunge of 2008-09(-10?), every bad real-estate deal goes bad in its own way.
Once upon a time, the Apthorp on the Upper West Side was a happy place. Built in 1908 by the Astors to resemble Florence's Pitti Palace, the 12-storey limestone pile on the south side of West 79th Street is one of the few apartment houses in New York to occupy an entire city block, stretching from Broadway to West End Avenue. It boasts an interior courtyard that spurs envy among passersby, who peer past the heavy gates guarding its three-storey vaulted entryway into an exclusive interior garden courtyard. Its apartments were built to be unusually expansive, to make apartment life as attractive to rich families as living in a brownstone. In the sixties and seventies, artists began flocking there, attracted to the space even if the neighbourhood was a little run-down. Lena Horne, George Balanchine and Joseph Heller were residents.
Best of all, it was rent-controlled. So what if that led to breath-taking abuses of rental law?
Two years ago, the screenwriter Nora Ephron penned a lighthearted piece for The New Yorker about falling in love at first sight with her Apthorp apartment, which she moved into in 1980. (Part of the 1986 comedy-drama Heartburn , which she wrote, was filmed in the building.) Her rent was $1,500 (U.S.) a month, after an up-front payment of "key money" to the previous tenant of $24,000. Kate Nelligan, the Canadian actress, reportedly paid $285,000 to a previous tenant when she signed her lease in 1991. Some years ago, Cyndi Lauper successfully argued in court that her rent be reduced from $3,250 to $507.
As the neighbourhood went upscale in the 1990s, the building's management began wresting some of the units out of the rent-control category and handing them over to other celebrities and network executives who could afford $10,000 a month or more. Conan O'Brien, Rosie O'Donnell, Al Pacino and the 60 Minutes correspondent Steve Kroft moved in. Toxic antipathy boiled up between management and long-time residents.
For years, an uncomfortable detente persisted until the fall of 2006, when the Apthorp owners washed their hands of the whole mess and sold the building for $426-million to Maurice Mann, a local landlord, who took out a mortgage of $385-million with Anglo Irish Bank. When one partner backed out at the last minute, he brought in the diamond billionaire Lev Leviev. Mann pledged to keep the place a rental, though no one believed him, and sure enough by the following year he announced it was going condo.
The good news? Residents would have first crack at buying their apartments. The bad news? They were going to cost about $3,000 a square foot, or about $6-million for the average Apthorp spread. That was more than the cost of 15 Central Park West, the heralded new Robert A.M. Stern building near Columbus Circle where Denzel Washington, Norman Lear and Sting bought units.
Eye-popping restoration plans were drawn up (according to The Observer: hand-cast lion-head tap spouts, and powder rooms outfitted with onyx fixtures), for which Mann and his partners took out an additional $135-million mortgage, bringing their total leverage to $520-million. A cheesy promotional film was shot, and Mann began trying to sell the units.
You know how this ends. Or maybe not.
So far, according to local brokers not involved in the building, not a single place has gone to contract. Mann and his partners began fighting. Six weeks ago Apollo Real Estate Advisors, the holder of the second mortgage, made a capital call of $22.7-million. Leviev, a friend of Vladimir Putin, pushed to remove Mann as the project's general manager. When Mann wouldn't back down, with other lenders circling and with Apollo threatening foreclosure, Leviev insisted they take their dispute to arbitration. But while that might normally be a smart way to settle their differences, the original agreement between Mann and Leviev calls for them to submit any irresolvable dispute to a beth din, or rabbinical court.
The problem? Mann wants to take the case to a Conservative Jewish beth din; Leviev insists it be an Orthodox panel of rabbis. At last report, Leviev's lawyer said he was going to ask the State Supreme Court to tell them which beth din they must use.
A couple of years ago, during the boom times, a tale like this would have been greeted by the rabble with unfettered glee. For those who couldn't participate in the rocketing economy, there was also the pleasure of watching oversized egos shrivel in failure. But the reporting over the Apthorp dispute, from the Times to the local real-estate blogs, is muted and joyless, as if even the usual catcallers are realizing they too might be caught in an economic whirlpool not of their own making. Without schadenfreude , what on earth will this city do for fun?

Full text: Construction of the athletes village was supposed to be smooth and profitable, a benefit for years to come. That was the dream, anyway, but then a heavy dose of reality woke everyone up. No one could have foreseen this dire real-estate market, but because of some early decisions, Vancouver is stuck with some very large bills
It was March 27, 2006. The Vancouver real-estate market was still in a frenzy, high-rise developments were selling out in days at skyrocketing prices, and Bob Rennie, the city's undisputed condo king, was on top of the world.
He decided to let an otherwise lacklustre housing workshop in on a little secret. Within days, Mr. Rennie confided, the city-owned, downtown waterfront land earmarked for the Olympic village would be sold for a price so high it would send shockwaves through the entire development community.
Sure enough, 10 days later, Vancouver City Council made its fateful decision to award the blue-ribbon Olympic village contract to a reputable but mid-sized development company with shallow pockets, anxious to show it could play with the big boys. The price paid by Millennium Development Corp. for the 2.6 hectares of prime property, destined for luxury condos, rental units and social housing once the 2010 Games were over, was a staggering $193-million. That was believed to be the highest sum per square foot ever paid for land in Canada.
Left in the dust were experienced, well-heeled developers Concord Pacific and the Wall Financial Corp., which bid around $170-million and $150-million, respectively.
As if that were not enough, city staff assured council that the bid was guaranteed and unconditional, with no risk to the city, and Millennium's financing plan was independent of pre-sales or market conditions.
It all seemed too good to be true. And much of it was.
TROUBLE BEGINS
The exorbitant purchase price subsequently set in motion a chain of events that has the troubled project on life support, the developer seemingly out of cash, and the city of Vancouver facing the largest financial loss in its history. It also casts the first serious cloud over the previously trouble-free 2010 Winter Olympics.
As the one-year countdown to the biggest event in the city's history approaches, the Games now have their own fiscal calamity, just like those that bedevilled so many other host Olympic cities.
The story of the rapid downfall of what was on paper a marvellous development is fraught with circumstances beyond anyone's control. But it is also dependent on a number of decisions that eventually tumbled into one another to bring the project to its current grim state.
Think of a salami, local developer and planner Michael Geller said this week: "You keep slicing and slicing and slicing, and at the end all you have is the string. The problems just kept slowly adding up."
But the key turning point came right at the beginning, when council, perhaps understandably, proved unable to resist the lure of $193-million.
Mr. Geller was one of those at the time who was stunned by the price, calling it a phenomenal amount of money. He worried it was simply too high. "Little did I realize how right I was," he said.
It shouldn't have required hindsight to see it, he said. "If they paid attention, people could have known at the time by looking at the other bids. Both Concord and Wall wanted to do this project. They spent a lot of money putting their bids together." Yet their final offers were far below the Millennium proposal, Mr. Geller noted.
After its intoxicating offer was accepted, matters became even tougher for Millennium. Council insisted on some rental housing and gold-plated environmental standards. The project also took longer than expected to go through a number of bureaucratic hoops before construction could begin.
That left Millennium with an exceedingly tight, Olympic-imposed deadline to complete a massive, complex project at the same time as costs were soaring in the overheated construction industry.
These factors, combined with the city's decision to retain title of the land until the project was finished, scared off Canadian banks from financing the development. With little money of its own, Millennium was forced south of the border into the high-interest clutches of Fortress Investment Group.
As construction chugged along and the project began to go over budget, Millennium started to get into financial difficulty. By June of 2007, council was sufficiently alarmed to make its now-controversial, in-camera agreement to guarantee completion of the development, situated on a desirable site of former industrial wasteland on a southeast swath of False Creek. That effectively left the city on the hook for everything.
Even then, matters might still have remained stable. But suddenly, the booming real-estate market, on which all assessments were based, began to tank, deeper and more quickly than anyone could have foreseen.
THE MARKET COLLAPSES
Just 15 months ago, North Vancouver realtor Austin Gangur spent five sleepless days and nights, lining up with dozens of other hopefuls for a crack at the first batch of the project's luxury condos to go on sale. The hoopla was palpable.
"Everyone was talking about it. Everyone was excited," Mr. Gangur recalled. "We were out there for days on end. The weather was cold and rainy, but the mood was great."
No one saw what was coming. "Everyone thought that in three years [when the condos would be ready for occupancy], prices would be up. Absolutely. We knew there might be a dip, but nothing like this," Mr. Gangur said. "I just can't believe the change. It's devastating."
Despite that initial enthusiasm, the first phase of condos did not sell out. A planned second marketing last spring was cancelled. When the hundreds of remaining condos will finally be sold and at what prices is the billion-dollar question.
By last fall, the developers were in the soup. Fortress had stopped lending them money, construction bills could only be met with an extraordinary $100-million advance from the city, and today, an emergency session of the legislature is being convened to provide Vancouver with the power to borrow hundreds of millions of dollars to prevent the project from going belly up.
"Sorry about the cliché, but it's been a perfect storm for [Millennium]," said Al Poettcker, president of the Urban Development Institute. "Not only did they pay a very aggressive price for the land, there were all those other things they agreed to take on in a very difficult construction environment.
"This is a very, very large project, and it had to rely on a robust sales market. Start adding everything up, coupled with the tight deadline and price of the land, and you can see it was a challenge for them from Day One."
GLIMMERS OF HOPE
And yet, there remains the project itself, which, when finished, will likely be as spectacular as advertised. Once its use by an estimated 2,800 Olympic athletes, coaches and officials is over, there will be, within months, an impressive, 1,100-unit residential development, spread over seven city blocks, with great views from the last available patch of prime waterfront land in Vancouver.
Senator Larry Campbell, a former mayor of Vancouver, bought early and doesn't regret it a bit. "I love the location. You can walk to almost everything. I bought two small apartments, one for rental, because I wanted to live there. At the end of the day, that's what it is. A place to live."
Eventually, all units will sell, and each sale will go toward reducing the city's costs. The project might actually break even, though most observers expect the city to suffer a loss of at least $50-million to $100-million.
As for Vancouver's bewildered taxpayers, buffeted about by a daily dose of gloomy headlines, they can only rue the day their elected officials chose big bucks over caution. Yesterday morning, a thick bank of fog swept in, smothering the Olympic village site and muffling, for a time, the buzz of construction. It seemed appropriate.

Full text: Arno Matis and Chris Doray of Iconstrux Architecture craft a striking new home from the bones of rather ordinary building
The Vancouver Special is reviled by many as awkward and unsightly - the architectural equivalent of the ugly duckling. But one specimen of the boxy dwelling - in the upscale Dunbar neighbourhood - recently re-emerged, swan-like, having shaken off its traditional stucco shell to display a transcendent design.
While many city architects have had a go at breathing new life into the style - noted for a low-pitched roof and balcony across the front - the recent project by Vancouver-based Iconstrux Architecture Ltd. is, well, rather special.
"We basically blew up the house," Iconstrux principal Arno Matis explains, "folded out the roof and gutted the interior, so now you can see from one end of the house to the other."
"We sculpt out a space," adds his partner, Chris Doray. "We're never just decorators."
The result - smooth, polished perfection via a striking but simple design, coaxed out of the banal local vernacular - bodes well for the future of Iconstrux, a firm whose principals met while working for celebrated architect Bing Thom. They struck out on their own in 2006.
Mr. Doray and Mr. Matis were approached in 2007 by developer Allan Askew, whom they'd met while working on a Thom residence. He'd been searching for just the right Vancouver Special - namely one on the West Side, where real estate values are higher, but also where heritage laws and a proliferation of arts-and-crafts homes can limit new-building options.
Mr. Askew saw a contemporary design opportunity in the unremarkable house in the Dunbar area, even with its exterior of stucco and brown wood siding.
While many Vancouver Specials, built for the most part from the 1960s to the 1980s, are classified as "existing non-conforming" - zoning lingo for an older house that breaks current bylaws - renovation makes economic sense.
In this case, it was a more attractive proposition to preserve the property at 4070 18th Ave. West, with its 2,500 square feet of space above grade, than to demolish it and rebuild. That's because zoning laws would have limited a new building to 1,800 square feet above ground and 700 square feet below.
Furthermore, zoning guidelines aimed at preserving the historic character of neighbourhoods would have prevented a contemporary design at the same square footage. And so, the Vancouver Special became an unlikely modernist hero.
The facade has gone from frumpy to fabulous. A massive stained oak door and large anodized aluminum-framed windows offer a stylish commer-
cial aesthetic. On the upper floor, the original balcony has been elongated, opened up, and given a dramatic tilt. It also features large aluminum-framed windows, as well as a cedar-clad railing.
The original stucco has been painted concrete grey - as much an effort to keep intact some of the "original architectural DNA," as Mr. Matis puts it, as it was a sly wink and nod to the 1960s ugly duckling.
Inside, the simple palette of stained oak flooring and concrete continues. The original space has been "deprogrammed and then reprogrammed," says Mr. Matis, transforming the ground floor from a utility room and spare bedrooms into an open living/dining space, and the upstairs - the traditional kitchen/living area in most specials - into bedrooms.
The objective, he says, was to "untie the knot" and free the spaces within but not jeopardize the structural integrity of the existing wood-frame construction.
The effect of the relatively low ceilings on the first floor is mitigated by a horizontal grain - large rectangular windows on the sides and in the "backsplash" that overlooks the yard - and echoed in the long concrete hearth, and even in the elongated oak flooring.
The horizontal uniformity and uninterrupted flow between front and back is calming to the eye. The windows effectively bounce the greenery of the landscaping back into the house, creating a whole new indoor/outdoor aesthetic.
A wall separates the living area from a small TV room that flows into the dining area, which looks out on a yard planted with bamboo and bordered by a cedar fence.
A small stone fountain and bench complete the Zen-like effect.
A journey up the stained oak stairs cantilevered off a concrete spine reveals a light-filled upper floor. A single skylight punched through the folds of the roof maximizes the southern light. The northwest-facing bedroom benefits from a newly angled roof as the increased slope allows for 13-foot ceilings.
The play of light is such that the same colour of ice mist paint on the walls can appear cool grey in the northern light and mint green with the southern exposure.
The adjacent master bedroom features another fireplace and elongated concrete mantel and flows into a south-facing ensuite. The delineation is articulated by the shift from oak to porcelain tile flooring. A tiny balcony opens up the space to the backyard.
In another south-facing room, a tilted wall that plays with one's sense of gravity accommodates the new roof. But this oddly angled wall responds to the tilted window of the front balcony in a way that suggests a meta-Vancouver Special - a house as civic metaphor, liberated from its boxy confines and bylaw strictures, embracing light, greenery and a very modern sensibility.

For lawyers clinging to the quaint notion that the billable hour model will survive the global financial crisis, don't read the latest Forbes magazine. Evan Chesler , managing partner of Wall Street powerhouse Cravath Swaine & Moore LLP, has authored a searing attack on his profession's billing practices. It is the kind of frank introspection that could only be possible in a time of such economic turmoil.
"The billable hour makes no sense, not even for lawyers. If you are successful and win a case early on, you put yourself out of work. If you get bogged down in a land war in Asia, you make more money. That is, frankly, nuts," Mr. Chesler writes.

Full text: PavCo chairman declines to say how much of that will go for retractable canopy
Believe it or not, there are mild, moonlit nights and idyllic afternoons bereft of driving rain on the West Coast, and not too long from now, local sports fans will finally get to enjoy them while watching the hometown B.C. Lions or Vancouver Whitecaps.
But the price for installing a sophisticated, state-of-the-art retractable roof that can be rolled up when the weather is good over BC Place, currently covered by a fixed dome, is not cheap.
Stadium officials revealed for the first time yesterday that the total cost of fixing up the 25-year-old facility for the future, including its spectacular new covering, will be as much as $365-million, nearly three times the original $126-million price tag for BC Place itself.
"That's an eye-popping number," fumed provincial NDP critic Rob Fleming, who charged that the bill has soared because of Liberal government indecision.
"They were told three years ago that the lifespan of the current roof was nearing an end and needed to be replaced, but they avoided the decision for far too long," Mr. Fleming said. "This was originally supposed to be a $60-million project."
PavCo, the Crown corporation in charge of the provincially owned structure, said most of the money for the roof and necessary upgrades will come from the sale of land around BC Place, existing cash reserves, increased business and sponsorship opportunities and significant operational savings.
The goal is to have the retractable roof in place by the spring or early summer of 2011, with work to begin immediately after the 2010 Winter Olympics.
The fabric covering will replace the mushroom-shaped, white Teflon dome that has protected BC Place from the elements, including sunshine, since the building went up in 1983, except for an embarrassing temporary deflation a year ago.
"The roof is going to be dramatically different, with a very different character," said PavCo chairman David Podmore. "It will be a showpiece for the city, a real icon."
Mr. Podmore declined to say how much of the $365-million would be needed just for the roof, with the rest used for refurbishing the interior in time for the Olympics, deferred maintenance and structural improvements.
The top will be similar to the retractable roof used to cover the renovated football stadium in Frankfurt, Germany, scene of recent World Cup soccer matches and used long ago by the Nazis for huge pro-Hitler rallies.
The Frankfurt fabric spread folds up and disappears into a large cone-like structure in the centre of the stadium when it is not being used. The complex process to open and close the roof takes about 20 minutes.
Mr. Podmore said about a dozen other facilities around the world already use this type of flexible roof. "We didn't want to experiment, although to retrofit it to an existing building, as we are doing, is rare."
He said PavCo does not anticipate financing difficulties, despite the economic downturn, which has deflated real-estate values and curbed business activity, both of which are being counted on to provide revenue for the project.
Adjacent land owned by the Crown corporation does not have to go on the market immediately, and corporate sponsorship commitments can wait, Mr. Podmore contended.
"This is a long-term program. The building was in awful condition and we have extended it by 30 years. There's nearly three years of work ahead, so we can pick our time in the market," he said. "We can go at everything cautiously, so I am not fussed about the current economic environment."
The project will also provide badly needed construction jobs, Mr. Podmore added. Two hundred workers are already on site to begin structural upgrades for the roof and to improve the stadium's woeful concessions and washroom facilities in time for the 2010 Olympics. BC Place will host the opening and closing ceremonies, and the nightly medal presentations.
"All told this will create approximately 3,000 person years of employment, with a total of 350 people working on site," he said. "So it's a great story at this particular time."
But Mr. Fleming of the NDP said the length of time it took the Liberal government to approve the new roof and the business plan meant that lucrative revenue opportunities from the formerly booming real-estate market were lost.
"There is now an additional risk to the taxpayers because they missed the boat on the best situation available to recover money from the private sector," he said.

Full text: Clarity now means fewer problems later if fixes become necessary
So you want to buy a new home. Maybe you visit a model home or a builder's showroom. You take a look around the proposed development, choose "your" lot from the plans, put down a deposit and you wait patiently.
Eventually your new house is ready and you have the pre-delivery inspection. Maybe you find a few problems - hopefully just minor, cosmetic ones - that you report to the builder for repair, and then you move in and live happily ever after.
That's the way it's supposed to work.
But it's not always the case. A lot of problems in new-home construction surface later, after a season or two. You might not notice a roof or flashing leak until after a few good rainstorms. A basement leak - same thing. Or, like one homeowner I've met - you might not notice you've got a problem in your basement floor until the gas company cuts you off because the floor is sinking.
Most of the time, a builder will step up and fix any problems, and the owner won't have to go to the home warranty program for resolution. But, if not, that's what they are there for: to intercede and protect consumers when the builders fail to honour their obligations under the warranty.
Not everything is covered. And, your definition of "problems" and your builder's might not be the same.
Basically, the warranty provided by your builder requires that when you move in, your new home should be: Constructed in a workmanlike manner and free from defects in material, fit for habitation, constructed in accordance with the building code and free of major structural defects.
"Workmanlike manner" does not mean perfect. It means reasonably acceptable - and what's that look like?
"Fit for habitation" means you won't be subject to any conditions that are dangerous or hazardous to life, health or safety. It doesn't mean that your kitchen has cupboards.
Your house should have an occupancy permit issued by the local authority. That means it has been inspected and has the proper smoke and carbon monoxide detectors, handrails, water supply, sewage disposal, lighting and heating systems, drains, venting systems - all the things that make it safe and fit to live in.
Most new-home builders' agreements of purchase and sale require that the buyer complete the transaction without holding back any part of the purchase price if the house is "substantially complete" at the closing date. That means it doesn't have to be completely finished on the closing date. It just has to be "fit for habitation" so that you can move in, and it should have an occupancy permit. There will often be things that aren't finished until after the closing date.
It actually means you don't necessarily have kitchen cupboards. You can still live in it, after all. When a builder wants to construct a new house, he applies to the local municipality and obtains a building permit. Construction begins and municipal inspectors regularly visit the house to monitor progress with the foundations, framing, roof, walls, plumbing, electrical and all the other important components of the home.
But what happens if your home is built without a permit? Or if some of the necessary inspections, such as heating, ventilation, framing and plumbing, were never done during construction, and still haven't been when you take possession?
In a typical new housing development, municipal building inspectors don't check every single part of every single home. There aren't enough inspectors to do that. They'll come out at the required point of the build and inspect one house - as a representative of the rest. Then, assuming it passes, they'll expect the builder to make the rest the same.
I don't want you give you the impression that all builders of new homes are crooks or that they don't care. There are good builders out there. But even the good ones - even the award-winning builders with the best customer service - have problems in their homes. It's up to you to keep an eye out for those problems and report them as required to the home warranty program.
The good builders will step up and fix the problem and honour their word.
The bad guys are another story. They'll evade responsibility, they'll deny the problem, they'll do patch repairs or wait until the warranty expires and it's "not their problem any more." What's the homeowner to do then? Your warranty is up, where do you go?
And what would you do if you found that your builder wasn't registered with the new-home warranty program (even though he claimed to be)? Or, worse yet, what if you discovered that your home never even had a municipal inspection, and that building permits weren't even issued on it until after it was finished? Watch CBC's Marketplace tonight at 8:30 p.m. and find out.
In every province, new homes are covered by a warranty and the programs are pretty similar across the country. Basically, every builder is required to provide their customers with a warranty for a period of time, up to a maximum amount of money, as protection against things such as defects in workmanship and materials, and unauthorized substitutions. Typically, the policies and standards rely on minimum code, since that's the industry standard. And you know how I feel about minimum code, but that's another story.
Usually, there's a schedule of warranties under which a homeowner has to report on problems within a certain time in order to make a claim. If you don't report properly, you might not be eligible for compensation - you have to take responsibility for that.
You as a homeowner have to remain vigilant. Don't just assume everything will be fine, because odds are, they're not. (And if you've got a problem with your home, very likely the entire neighbourhood has the same or similar problems since they've been built by the same company.)

Full text: Wychwood's former streetcar repair sheds get an environmentally-friendly makeover and become some of the most desired spaces for artists in the city. Kathy Flaxman reports
The Wychwood streetcar repair barns were once a major hub of the Toronto Civic Railway, the forerunner of the TTC. The site of the five attached brick structures - between Wychwood Avenue and Christie Street in what was then the city's north end - also became a sort of mini Union Station in the decades after the buildings were completed in 1921.
According to Joe Mihevc, city councillor and current vice-chairman of the Toronto Transit Commission, local lore has it that on weekends and holidays, residents carrying picnic baskets took a tram to the Wychwood stop to catch streetcars to greener places.
Today, the barns are again a hub of activity - but of a different sort. They have been reincarnated as the Artscape Wychwood Barns, an impressive 60,000-square-foot complex incorporating rental housing and studios for artists, a covered street, a greenhouse, outdoor bake oven, theatre space and offices.
It's also the first converted heritage building to be certified under the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) program.
Vacant since the mid-1980s, the barns were inspected by a group of city officials in 1998. One of them was Mr. Mihevc (Ward 21, St. Paul's West).
"We were struck by their beauty," he recalls, noting the barns' high ceilings, the soft light filtering through skylights and the massive girders.
"Now the barns have been restored and reincarnated, and they own their history. Rather than drywall and plaster over everything, the majestic features are celebrated," he says.
The project was launched in 2001, and involved a team of architects, consultants and community activists. One of those involved, Joe Lobko of du Toit Architects Ltd., says the team had to grapple with many different expectations.
"We were challenged to retain the memory of the railway and build on the great work that was done before," he says. "There are a lot of sharp contrasts. ... The challenge of a renovation like this is to incorporate what was done and give it fresh but still sustainable use - to take the feisty old character of the buildings and make them come to life."
No one seems to know the identity of the original designers, but their work has captivated and impressed many of today's architects. One of the project's historical architects, Edwin Rouse of ERA Architects Inc., says the original barns, which were started in 1913, are considered prime examples of early industrial architecture.
"As historical architects, we have a lot of knowledge of traditional building styles," Mr. Rouse says. "These barns are old treasures that by virtue of how they have survived have demonstrated their sustainability. They are part of our industrial heritage.
"We didn't want to treat them with kid gloves," he adds, but "we know a lot of excellent [tradespeople] who could repair brickwork, for example, and give an acceptable result."
The historical preservation work is evident in features such as the brick walls, which have been carefully repaired in a way that respects the past.
"It isn't that the repair work should be invisible," Mr. Rouse explains. "But in 20 years, when everything has weathered, you won't be able to see it."
ERA colleague Jeff Hayes adds: "Where we cleaned the brick and blocks, the work was done so that a patina of paint still remained. In Canada, restoration doesn't mean getting everything squeaky clean and Disneyfying it. The bricks we used are from England, made with subtle variations, not some type of fake 'ye olde bricks.' "
Mr. Rouse notes: "Our architectural specifications read like old recipes. They focus a lot on colour and texture and placement. There are some terra cotta blocks that are part of the original barns and they look wonderful."
With the complex completed, artist-residents can now do their own creating. Nadia Tasci, for instance, designs and makes glass beads and jewellery in one of the live-work studios, which she shares with partner Uros Jelic, a painter.
They left behind more costly and far less desirable premises to move into the one-bedroom unit.
"It is very exciting to be a part of this community," Ms. Tasci says. "There will be a lot of opportunities for us, in meeting other artists and helping one another. The fact that the rent is geared to income means we can pursue our crafts full time."
Already, the couple has begun to transform the utilitarian space, which has concrete floors and a bedroom with a skylight. They're investing "sweat equity" to make the unit come alive, says Mr. Lobko of du Toit Architects.
Billie Bridgman, Artscape's executive vice-president, says that many of the city's artists have been displaced by development, adding that many of them were "forced by economics to work in conditions that were unsafe, illegal and dangerous."
Unlike some old warehouses with high ceilings and huge windows, the Wychwood barns have big skylights but very little in terms of windows.
"So there is light from the skylights and from borrowed light in the covered street, for some studios," Ms. Bridgman says.
In addition to spaces for 12 not-for-profit organizations, the complex contains 15 artist studios and 26 artist live/work units.
Sizes in the latter group include 433-square-foot bachelor units, one-bedrooms measuring 730 square feet, and three-bedroom suites of up to 1,123 square feet. Approximately 50 people live in the residential section.
Ms. Bridgman admits that the spaces may not be as large as many would like.
"Every artist would love to have 2,000 square feet, but the sizes of the studios and apartments were derived from what [people on] our waiting list told us [they] could work with."
Mr. Lobko gives Artscape a lot of credit for the "green" features, and its decision to focus on long-term energy needs.
"This project has geothermal heating and the rainwater is collected for ... flushing the toilets and for irrigation. There is a wall built of recycled plastic," he says, and notes that Artscape had to raise extra funds to afford these initiatives.
"J. Michael Godawa from Stantec Consulting and his colleagues Zorica Gombac and Nuno Duarte have used the earth's energy and the structure itself for the heating, a remarkable achievement," Mr. Lobko explains.
"The building itself is like a buffer, utilizing a kind of a porch effect, where a vestibule shields the inside and allows the air to be cooler or warmer than that outside.
"We brought this project in at $200 a square foot and still will be LEED certified. A project in New York that won an award cost $1,000 square foot, so that tells you how well everyone here did."
But the architect is sanguine about the success of the development, and realistic about its future. "I'm an optimist; there's no other way to be. But funnily enough, you have to realize this moment is tiny in the overall history of these buildings. I expect there to be a period of adaptation.
"There are a lot of users here: How will people like living next to a theatre? There may be some acoustic issues.
"But society throws away way more buildings than it should," he says. I feel very lucky to be involved in the redevelopment of these amazing brownfields and these incredible, unique structures. I see projects like this as examples of what we should be building."
*****
Barns by the number
* No. 1: studios and live/work spaces for artists (10 bachelor units, 10 one-bedrooms, and six three-bedroom suites between 1,097 and 1,123 square feet).
* No. 2: covered mall-like space that is the site of a farmers' market on Saturday mornings.
* No. 3: theatre, offices and a daycare centre.
* No. 4: greenhouse where food will be grown, and educational events will take place, some making use of an outdoor bake oven.
* No. 5: space exposed to the elements; it merges with the park-
land that is part of the site.

Full text: Obama-mania crowds could exceed estimates of five million, giving traffic-averse locals reason to rent their homes and head south
As the pilgrimage to Washington begins, when spectators from all over the world flock to Capitol Hill in the hope of capturing a glimpse of history-in-the-making, the Beckman family will be hightailing it out of town.
They will be part of a reverse migration of inaugural refugees, locals simultaneously repelled from the American capital by the congestive hazards of millions of spectators and lured by the promise of rental income and vacation discounts the week of president-elect Barack Obama's swearing-in as the 44th president of the United States.
"I was so gung-ho, and I was such an Obama supporter and I was thinking about volunteering for the inauguration, and then I thought though it would be so fun, it would be once in a lifetime, being from this area I'm kind of crowd-adverse," said Yael Beckman, a real estate broker who lives in Crofton, Md., with her husband and two young daughters.
"So I was thinking maybe it's just best to stay away and enjoy it all from the comfort of a TV."
So the Beckmans have instead decided to rent out their home, a colonial-style four-bedroom house located about 20 minutes from downtown Washington, for $500 a night, and visit family in Annapolis.
By all estimates, Mr. Obama's inauguration will attract a crowd of unprecedented size to an event of unprecedented significance. Fewer than half-a-million people attended George W. Bush's inauguration in 2005, and the most modest estimates predict more than 1.5 million people will crowd the National Mall, an open-area park in downtown Washington, on Inauguration Day.
Road and bridge closings, crashing cellular phone networks, thousands of high-demand porta-potties and intense security are in the offing.
Kelly Ross is an Obama supporter who lives only three kilometres from the Pentagon. She is still deciding whether she'd rather spend inauguration weekend in either Richmond or Roanoke, Va.
"D.C. can get very crowded, but this is unprecedented," she said. "I don't think they realize what's going to happen here."
Ms. Ross is familiar with the contagion of Obama-mania that has gripped the United States, and said she wouldn't be surprised if crowds exceeded even the highest estimates of five million.
"The Mall in itself can contain two million people and they're expecting five. That in itself doesn't sound appealing to me, so I'm going to try and stay away from there," she said.
She, too, is renting out her home, a one-bedroom apartment with views of the downtown skyline available for $500.
According to Edith Grossman, a travel agent at Circle Travel in Washington, many locals are avoiding and profiting from the inauguration chaos by renting out their homes and heading south.
"A lot of them are heading to warmer destinations like Florida," she said.
And travel discounts are available to these Capitol Hill runaways.
Amelia Island Plantation, a Florida golf and tennis resort lined with five kilometres of beach, is offering a 20-per-cent D.C. Escape discount to Washington-area residents.
The resort's chief marketing officer, Richard Goldman, said he has a sister who lives in the Washington area who was concerned about the perils of commuting to work during inauguration week.
"So we put on our thinking caps and said, let's see if we can't put a program together that creates great value and gives residents who don't want necessarily to be there a reason to escape D.C. and come down to experience Amelia Island," he said. Four reservations under the D.C. Escape discount were made yesterday alone, according to Mr. Goldman.

Abstract: Until four years ago, after learning her father's birthplace on his death, she didn't know Bulgaria from Burundi. "I had to look it up in an atlas," she admits. "I didn't know where it was." The father she thought was German was in fact born as a Kalojanoff, fleeing the Communist regime in 1951. Fearing suspicion for having been born in what was by then a faithful satellite of the Soviet Union, he kept from his family his origins.

Full text: At first, the problem seemed so easy to solve it was a wonder no one had thought of it before.
The problem: The old folks in a hamlet outside of Yambol in Bulgaria were freezing.
Ann Thomson, 50, of Victoria, learned of the plight of the elders from friends working at a real estate office in the southeast of the Black Sea nation.
She knew from her visits the suffering peasants lived in huts and hovels lacking running water. Electricity remained a fantasy. But most had small wood-burning stoves atop which water fetched from a well could be boiled.
If you had hot water, Ms. Thomson reasoned, you could stay warm by cuddling a hot- water bottle.
In North America, folks use space heaters, or electric blankets, or heating pads warmed by microwave ovens. An object filled with warmed water seems a hopeless relic of a previous epoch.
Ms. Thomson, the proprietor of a craft shop, figured a brief word in the store's weekly newsletter might persuade a few customers to donate their underused hot- water bottles.
The bottles arrived in dribs and drabs. She expected to gather perhaps a dozen. She recognized "hot water bottles for Bulgaria" is less than an inspiring charity slogan.
In time, a dozen arrived. A second dozen soon piled up. Then, a third.
The final total was eight dozen plus five. That's 101 bottles, not as cute as the Dalmatian puppies of the Disney cartoon, but far more practical.
The donations were neatly packed into three boxes. It was time to send them to Europe. That's when the troubles began.
The quoted shipping costs were as high as $1,600, which is far more than the value of 101 second-hand rubber Thermoses.
She eventually got an acceptable $500 quote from Air Canada Cargo. The clerk also offered a crash course in the intricacies of overseas shipments. To enter Bulgaria, Ms. Thomson needs only a Canadian passport. However, her hot water bottles required a sheaf of documentation, generating enough paperwork to warm even the cold heart of a bureaucrat.
At this point, Ms. Thomson decided to call her local member of Parliament for assistance. She met with Denise Savoie to explain the circumstances, feeling only mildly foolish since the NDP MP was eager to return to Ottawa during the constitutional crisis.
In turn, the MP met with Bulgarian embassy officials in the capital.
After overcoming initial confusion over the properties of the mysterious hot water bottle, apparently an innovation unknown in the homeland, it was agreed the packages could be sent to Bulgaria as charitable donations.
Last month, the boxes began the long journey.
They arrived safely in Sofia at 9:15 p.m. on Dec. 17.
Where a customs agent demanded duty payments.
Officials also began charging $10 a day storage for the boxes.
The Balkan state is balking at releasing the shipment.
If money is not paid by Friday, she has been told, the boxes will be seized.
She has put calls out to the embassy in Ottawa and to her MP in Victoria.
"I thought Canada was bad when it came to bureaucracy," Ms. Thomson said, "but Bulgaria wrote the textbook."
"We're not trying to cheat the Bulgarian government out of justifiable taxes. If I was trying to ship prescription medicines, or expensive sporting goods, I could see their concern about how they could end up in the wrong hands."
Until four years ago, after learning her father's birthplace on his death, she didn't know Bulgaria from Burundi. "I had to look it up in an atlas," she admits. "I didn't know where it was." The father she thought was German was in fact born as a Kalojanoff, fleeing the Communist regime in 1951. Fearing suspicion for having been born in what was by then a faithful satellite of the Soviet Union, he kept from his family his origins.
Intrigued, Ms. Thomson travelled to Bulgaria, where she found a people warm in spirit if poor in possessions. The cities reminded her of the Victoria of her childhood, a small-town idyll where folks kept chickens in their backyard.
Let's take a moment to reflect on the humble hot water bottle. Some credit the modern object, a precursor to the Thermos flask, to the Croatian inventor Slavoljub Eduard Penkala, who registered a patent in 1903. He went on to develop the world's first mechanical pencil, as well as an insecticide and a flying machine he named for a butterfly.
The hot water bottle was so simple in design it clearly did not exhaust his wellspring of ideas.
For Ms. Thomson, sending an ordinary household item from Canada to Bulgaria seemed a modest contribution to improving relations between nations.
"We're not building an orphanage, or something magnificent," she said.
"We were just trying to get a few old people warm."
Modest thought it may be, it remains a worthy goal. The forecast for Yambol today promised a nippy low of -7.
She already has a resolution for 2010.
The next time Ms. Thomson gathers donations for Bulgaria she will pack them up in a suitcase, book a flight to Europe and deliver them in person.

Full text: What's extraordinarily different with this downswing is society's collective neural response to it
Nine years ago, there was a bogeyman named Y2K. Remember him? Remember the endless stream of pundits telling us society was coming to a gruesome end? Planes falling from the sky; melted power grids; tumbleweeds rolling down the aisles of the local Safeway. We'd all be lucky if any of us made it alive past January, and even then only if we had a power generator, a silo filled with gasoline, 2,000 cans of tuna and some good weather.
And then came Jan. 1, 2000, and the only drama that transpired, I believe, was that a chain of drugstores in Cape Town, South Africa, had its hard drives erased - and somewhere deep inside Switzerland, a few trains were late - and that was it.
I mention this now because it seems to me we're inside another Y2K-like hysteria scenario, except our current doomfest doesn't have a Jan. 1 expiry date - it's open-ended. Perhaps Jan. 20? Maybe the third quarter of 2009? Early 2010? Or perhaps the worst date of all: unknown .
I thought about expiry dates, and so I spoke with friends a few decades older than me and I asked them what it felt like to have a mortgage in the 1970s and early 1980s, and they said it obviously didn't feel too good. And then I asked them how scary it felt in general to weather the early 1970s financial woes and all of the subsequent cyclical downswings since then.
The unanimous agreement seems to be that, while previous downswings were no cakewalk, what's happening now is weirder, darker and spookier than anything that's come before. It obsesses them and eats up a huge slice of their everyday imaginative lives in a way previous recessions never did.
Obviously, the financial mechanics of gloomageddon are different from previous downswings, and this one may quite easily end up being far bigger than them all. But what's extraordinarily different with this downswing is society's collective neural response to it. The 2000 tech bubble burst was pretty darn bad, but people weren't eaten up by it the way they are by this current mess. What seems to be different is the way we look at the present and the way we look at the near future and the way we do (and don't) handle risk.
Marshall McLuhan tells us that "terror is the normal state of any oral society, for in it, everything affects everything all the time." What he perhaps didn't foresee was that terror didn't turn out to be Winston Smith's Nineteen Eighty-Four . Terror turned out to be a friend's grandmother bingeing on conspiracy websites during a late-night browsing jag, triggering days of pension freak-out e-mails with her daughter, Sarah, down in Human Resources, who then installs a real-time Dow Jones ticker widget in the top right-hand corner of her work screen, and when Sarah goes home, she and her husband browse online real-estate listings wondering when the bottom's going to hit. Nothing has really changed, but everybody's adrenalized, miserable and chomping at the bit for data - more data, please - all we want is more data . What's going on here?
As old economic models seem increasingly irrelevant, a new field, neuroeconomics, is evolving: Scientists study human responses to risk and the near future on a small scale, then apply gleaned lessons to society as a whole. The evolving thinking is that electronics extend our central nervous systems, and that economic news in particular has hit the point of speed and saturation that our microeconomic daily freak-outs are becoming the new macroeconomics.
The advantages of time, geography, education, connections, gender and wealth have largely levelled the information playing field with democratic vim. Your grandmother gets her Nasdaq data at the same speed as David Geffen, but she's probably not as agile as him at interpreting it in a rational way. And when she or Mr. Geffen or anyone else go to interpret their financial information, their brain's amygdala moves into action, as do parts of their orbitofrontal cortex that regulate the amygdala.
I don't wish to play down the science behind neuroeconomics. Basically, when the brain needs to make a decision on a situation that may well go sideways, the brain tends not to use statistics or logic to rationally guide its way. Instead, it says: "An information vacuum? I hate vacuums. I know - I'll fill in that vacuum with fear." The fear switch is pulled, and welcome to our world. We have a billion amygdalas out there feeding on each other, exacerbating their worst tendencies and creating fear where it's neither merited nor of any help.
So, as human nature doesn't seem likely to change in the foreseeable future, the only thing we can do is command our rational selves to stop our irrational selves from clicking the Reuters or Huffington or Drudge bookmark every 10 minutes. As we know, bad news travels instantly; good news ends up on a slag heap. Remember: Capitalism is a robust system. Things really will get better. This will pass. Go out and buy a Chrysler.
Or maybe not.
Douglas Coupland is finishing a biography of Marshall McLuhan.

Softer version of Yates classic still satisfying

Abstract: Both actors are very good, especially at depicting the self-consciousness of their characters: [Kate Winslet]'s April has the posture and precise diction of someone anxious to make a regal impression.

They're even play-acting the first time they meet at a Greenwich Village party around 1948.

Full text:   REVOLUTIONARY ROAD
Directed by Sam Mendes
Written by Justin Haythe
Starring Leonardo DiCaprio
and Kate Winslet
Classification: 14A
***
The two most perfect shots in Revolutionary Road take place in the middle of the movie: One is of Kate Winslet, as April Wheeler, dressed in a white satin, form-fitting dress, walking toward her car, a smile playing across her face. In her hand are tickets and travel documents for Europe. The image that follows directly after it is of Leonardo DiCaprio as her husband, Frank, learning against the balustrade at Grand Central Station, his fedora at a rakish angle, as streams of identically dressed commuters rush to work behind him.
Frank and April are about to take the big leap from their suburban familiarity to the unknown new life in Europe and they're at their happiest. The shots are impeccably composed and lit and they define the quality and limitations of Sam Mendes's adaptation from Richard Yates's novel, which is the difference between a butterfly battering its wings on the sides of a jar, and the same creature framed under glass on a wall. To some degree, the difference is one of time: Yates's book, published in 1961, was set six years before, in the mid-fifties. For us, the story is half a century away, a distance for irony rather than rage.
The movie's studied quality comes not only from Roger Deakins's cinematography but also Justin Haythe's screenplay, which emphasizes the period jargon, with characters saying phrases like "I must scoot" and "You were swell."
Sam Mendes, primarily a theatre director, has worked in this territory before with his Oscar-winning American Beauty , first portraying the comically artificial social codes before revealing the human pain beneath them. Revolutionary Road is a better movie than American Beauty because it doesn't rely on such blatant caricatures.
Yates wasn't sympathetic to his characters (the book has similarities to one of his favourite novels, Madame Bovary ), but he did take us, mercilessly, inside their heads, through their rationalizations and vanities. The movie can't get us there, but offers another sense of intimacy. DiCaprio and Winslet, lovers again for the first time since 1997's Titanic , bring a lot of good will. It's painful to watch Jack and Rose grow up to turn into a drunken, angry couple in a John Cassavetes film.
Both actors are very good, especially at depicting the self-consciousness of their characters: Winslet's April has the posture and precise diction of someone anxious to make a regal impression. DiCaprio's Frank is anything but frank: His character seems to take a moment before he speaks, as if he's always planning on the effect he'll make. They're even play-acting the first time they meet at a Greenwich Village party around 1948. He's just finished college on the GI Bill, playing a swaggering, working-class guy. She's studying acting (she holds her cigarette against her profile like Bette Davis). What they have in common, initially, is a shared belief that Frank's headed for something special.
Seven years and two children later, we meet them again. They're living in suburban Connecticut where April is starring at a local high school in an inept amateur theatre production of The Petrified Forest (a play about a waitress who fantasizes about going to Paris). Driving home, they begin to bicker, which turns into an ugly argument. She has just watched one of her dreams die, and he's too insensitive to see it.
Or, perhaps he's too unhappy to care, in a mid-rank job spinning marketing blather for Knox Business Machines in the city, the same company where his father spent an anonymous career. On his 30th birthday, Frank initiates an affair with a secretary who looks like a dowdy Betty Boop doll (played by Elia Kazan's granddaughter, Zoe Kazan).
April suddenly has a plan to save their marriage and their dreams. They'll move to Paris with the kids, she'll get a job as a secretary and Frank can do something artistic. He consents, with a mixture of excitement and fear, and the couple are buoyed up by their plans, even more acutely aware of their differences from the common herd. Frank's workmates are skeptical; the Wheelers' neighbours, Shep and Milly (David Harbour and Kathryn Hahn) are disturbed by the implied criticism of their shared lives.
Unexpected support for their plan comes from the son of their Stepford Wife-like real-estate agent (Kathy Bates). John Givings (Michael Shannon) is on a day pass from a mental institution when he first visits them. Though he's had many electric shock treatments, he sees things with a brutal clarity and immediately endorses Frank and April's decision to escape: "Plenty of people are on to the emptiness," he tells them. "but it takes real guts to see the hopelessness."
By that measure, Richard Yates's novel shows real guts: The novel's ending is crushing. Though the movie is faithful, it's in a different register, with an after-effect that's less shocking than quietly numbing. Here, again, our distance from the time period matters, particularly in regard to April's character. Her aversion to motherhood, desperation for creative recognition and her emotional swings now seem like a feminist case study, and the movie is kinder to both her and Frank. Though Revolutionary Road is a less stringent work than Yates's book, it also feels like a more tolerant and humane one.

Let's take a (non-Pinter) pause to review cowed CBS News

Abstract: AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH (CBC, 8 p.m.) is Al Gore's enormously influential documentary about global warming. Of course, Gore didn't actually make it. Director Davis Guggenheim's production is the film version of the lecture that Gore has been giving for years. Thus, it's really Al Gore giving a lecture, with loads of footage to illustrate his points. It opens with Gore saying, "I'm Al Gore, I used to be the next President of the United States", as all the lectures open.

Full text:   Happy New Year. May you thrive. This year: Be nice to each other. And challenge authority.
Now that we've got the pleasantries out of the way, let's get cracking.
Harold Pinter was overrated. Oh yes, he was. A small handful of plays, all derivative and slight. Beckett for Dummies, that's Pinter's oeuvre. And he was pretentious, an indulger in reflexive anti-Americanism, anti-this-and-that to the point where he was absurdly serving on the Committee to Defend Slobodan Milosevic.
The frailty and smallness of Pinter's alleged originality as a writer is underlined by his gift for dramatizing, for film or television, the work of others. Given someone else's material, he was great at whittling it down, finding the essential narrative thread and themes and putting them on the screen.
His adaptation of John Fowles's morbidly overwrought novel The French Lieutenant's Woman was rightly praised, for the deftness with which Pinter cut through the clutter. His best work for the screen, big or small, mind you, was a superb adaptation for the BBC of a novel by Aidan Higgins, Langrishe, Go Down , in 1978. (Go find it, if you can, it's gloriously good.) A small-scale novel with major themes, it's set in a dilapidated country estate in Ireland in the 1930s. A German postgraduate student (Jeremy Irons in his first major role) arrives and browbeats the lonely, thirtysomething daughter of the house, one Imogen Langrishe (Judi Dench) into an affair. It's all about Europe's abject capitulation to Hitler and the Nazis. Pinter also had a small acting role in it.
While I'm at it, and because a "Memories of Pinter" moment is required, I saw him once. He was sitting in the bar of Bloom's Hotel in Dublin, having coffee with his missus, Antonia Fraser, a great beauty. They looked cozy and happy together. Then they disappeared into the hotel elevator. That's it. It was not, I emphasize, like the time I saw Samuel Beckett on the street in London. I asked him for directions, just to say something to him. And he very kindly obliged.
Speaking of George W. Bush, which we weren't, but Pinter often did, so we'll just carry on - one of the terrifically promising dramas of 2009 involves Bush, Dan Rather and CBS.
In the week before Christmas an intriguing news item began to surface. You see, Dan Rather is suing CBS for $70-million (U.S.) and his lawyers expect the case to go to court early this year. Rather is suing for breach of contract. His lawyers say the case will reveal everything in the murky background to events surrounding Rather's provocative story from September of 2004, in which he reported that young George got special treatment in getting into the National Guard and in avoiding duties.
At the time, the story was quickly denounced as flawed reporting, and CBS back-pedalled like crazy and set up an investigation. The upshot was that although Rather and his team were exonerated of any political agenda, the story was dismissed as unreliable, and certain CBS staff resigned and eventually Rather left CBS News under a cloud. Now Rather's lawyers say that CBS caved to political pressure, that the story was valid and Rather was humbled so that CBS could mollify the Bush administration.
The lawsuit also makes allegations that CBS News was extremely reluctant to allow Rather to report evidence of torture at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. According to the lawsuit, CBS held the story for weeks and Rather was the subject of direct pressure to bury the story, from General Richard Meyers, then head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
Those were heady, dangerous days in the United States, when the fury of the White House and the American right was aimed at any media outlet or person who questioned the invasion of Iraq or the veracity of statements and claims made by President Bush. Just ask the Dixie Chicks.
This past year television has been dominated by unparalleled news events. Often, fiction was beggared by fact as the U.S. presidential election unfolded. Now, in 2009 we may at last see some real examination of how the American media, especially TV news, performed in those dangerous days under Bush. Something to look forward to, I think.
Airing tonight
AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH (CBC, 8 p.m.) is Al Gore's enormously influential documentary about global warming. Of course, Gore didn't actually make it. Director Davis Guggenheim's production is the film version of the lecture that Gore has been giving for years. Thus, it's really Al Gore giving a lecture, with loads of footage to illustrate his points. It opens with Gore saying, "I'm Al Gore, I used to be the next President of the United States", as all the lectures open. He's very persuasive and you may be disappointed that he doesn't harangue or hector the audience. He simply pulls together the threads of evidence and knits them into a conclusive call for action. Gore is still the politician here and it is easy to see why some people are deeply skeptical about his arguments. In particular, the segments in which Gore explains how, over several decades, he came to understand the issue, seem to be part of a politician's ad campaign.
SO YOU THINK YOU CAN DANCE CANADA (CTV, 8 p.m.) is actually the final part of an all-day marathon. CTV begins airing the key segments from the hit show at 1 p.m. and continues - with only a break from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m. - until you watch the finale in this timeslot. The show is an international franchise, of course, with a set format: judges, dancers, voting. Could a Canadian version be better than the usual thing, better than the Fox show on U.S. TV? Yep, it was. There were some astonishing moves, manoeuvres, turns and locomotions going on throughout the series. Go ahead. Dance the day away. This is going to be one demanding year. J.D.

Ottawa's Leeder of the pack

Author: MacGregor, Roy

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/ottawas-leeder-pack/docview/382674241/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: This time, he proved right. The NHL announced expansion and they pitched as no one had ever pitched the league. They prepared a "book" on how the franchise would come about, the rink and team but a part of a huge package involving suburban real estate, a new "town," shopping and commercial enterprises. The NHL was overwhelmed.

Full text:   Let us close out this year with a happy story that includes numbers.
Not only that, but a happy story with the popular Canadian swear word "Ottawa" not, for once, being taken in vain.
The capital of Canada is about to establish the attendance record for the world junior hockey championship. By the time the gold-medal game is played Monday evening, some 450,000 spectators will have filled the two rinks where the tournament is being played, shattering the previous mark of 325,138 set three years ago in Vancouver.
That gold-medal game will also surely eclipse the single-game attendance record, set Friday when 19,622 fans jammed Scotiabank Place to watch Canada's 8-1 blowout of the Czech Republic.
That opening-night crowd surpassed the previous single-game record for the tournament, set in Calgary on Dec. 30, 1994, when 19,465 watched Canada play the Czechs.
The top 15 attendance records, no surprise, have all been set in Canada, a nation so mad for the game that the entire country prorogues for the two weeks following Christmas to watch children still dealing with acne handle spotlight so intense it would melt pucks.
It is not at all the same elsewhere. In Sweden, another country that supposedly loves this game, a mere 63,493 fans took in the tournament two years ago. But in Canada they not only come, they bring money. The tournament is expected to pump between $50-million and $60-million into the local economy.
This at a time when there is supposedly no local economy to be found.
And the world juniors is not the only happy hockey story going on in Ottawa.
We are not speaking of the Ottawa Senators.
The world's largest minor hockey tournament, the Bell Capital Cup, is under way in every other rink in the city. At a time when hockey tournaments are being cancelled in other cities because of the recession, 485 pee wee and atom teams, both boys and girls, have come here - including teams from China and Finland, as well as 70 from the United States - to pump another $14-million into the local economy.
That's approximately $75-million in mini-sticks, souvenir jerseys, body paint, tickets, hotel rooms, restaurants and too much to drink - all for a meaningless game played by children under 20.
The Bell Capital Cup was launched 10 years ago by Cyril Leeder, the chief operating officer of the Senators.
It was not his idea but one he ran with, in part because it meant hockey for his own two boys, Dillon and Tyler.
"It was basically run out of the top drawer of my filing cabinet," Leeder said. It began with 94 teams, peaked three years ago at 510, and is now run by a full-time general manager, Aaron Robinson.
Such success naturally meant the 49-year-old Leeder would be asked to join the group chasing the world junior hockey championship.
They worked hard, but lost out to Winnipeg, to Halifax and then to Vancouver, only winning the 2009 tournament after Senators owner Eugene Melnyk guaranteed the awarding committee a surplus of $12.5-million if the games came to Ottawa.
A week from now, when they cash out the final till, that guarantee will seem a bargain.
This marks Leeder's 20th year in hockey - a career he never figured on when he left McMaster University to take up accounting and begin working for a small real estate company, Terrace Investments.
The company held weekly shinny games at one of those small, cold rinks in Ottawa that are packed these days with visiting children. He was sitting around after one game having a few cold ones with the boss, Bruce Firestone, and his old hockey pal from Brockville, Randy Sexton, when Firestone threw out the idea of them chasing an NHL expansion franchise.
It wasn't just beer talk even if it sounded like it. Leeder's final paper at school had been on the NHL as a business; Sexton attended a U.S. school on a hockey scholarship; and Firestone was a dreamer who sometimes struck gold and sometimes struck out.
This time, he proved right. The NHL announced expansion and they pitched as no one had ever pitched the league. They prepared a "book" on how the franchise would come about, the rink and team but a part of a huge package involving suburban real estate, a new "town," shopping and commercial enterprises. The NHL was overwhelmed.
It shouldn't have happened, but it did. The NHL only wanted its $50-million (U.S.) on the table, something that Terrace agreed to while sturdier operations balked at, and so the NHL went with Ottawa and Tampa Bay, perhaps the two shakiest candidates.
They won the franchise but eventually lost it all to recession and reality, the team and rink eventually going to another owner, to bankruptcy, and finally to Melnyk. Today, Firestone teaches a university business course, Sexton is assistant general manager with the Florida Panthers and Leeder alone remains with the Senators.
And yet, if you go back 20 years to Firestone's wild dream of putting a hockey rink in a barren cornfield, you can find that hockey rink today packed to the rafters for the world juniors.
And all around it are housing, hotels, shops and 40-odd restaurants.
"Almost identical to the way he saw it happening," Leeder said.

Full text:   Once the dream factory for 24,000 mobile workers, Fort McMurray's slowdown may be most devastating for the communities across Canada who export them. Gordon Pitts reports
Hungry young tradesmen like Evan Brewer used to be as plentiful on the ground in Fort McMurray as chips at the Boomtown Casino. They'd get off the plane from Atlantic Canada and score big money in the oil sands.
Now Mr. Brewer feels like one of the last of an endangered species. "I just got in under the wire," says the 23-year-old journeyman welder from Fredericton, as he lines up for the 5 a.m. breakfast of cereal, doughnuts and croissants at the Ace Inn, a favoured downtown hostelry for young men in work boots and hard hats.
With a base pay of $40 an hour and living allowances, Mr. Brewer is pulling down better than $3,000 a week, much more than he ever dreamed of back in New Brunswick, where he was living in his parents' basement.
But since he signed up at Suncor Energy Inc. in June, the floor has collapsed under the great oil sands bonanza.
Project after future project has been shelved or slowed down until, according to the companies, plunging oil prices stabilize and financing starts to loosen up.
Fort McMurray will not become a ghost town. You can still see the signs everywhere of an overheated economy. Highway 63 is a parking lot during rush hour as the workers stream out of the city toward the big oil sands projects. The slots at the Boomtown are busy even on a Monday night, and you can hardly find a hotel room with less than a week's notice.
But the mood is decidedly less bullish in the work camps and motels around Fort Mac, where the shadow population, the temporary workers flown in from everywhere, are insecure about the future.
In McMurray Newfoundlanders club, a popular watering hole, the waitress is ominously talking of layoffs. Mr. Brewer's tradesman job looks safe - welders are the aristocracy of the oil sands - but he doesn't expect a lot of his friends from the Maritimes to be joining him any time soon.
For at least another two years, and probably more, Fort Mac will no longer be the dream factory for ambitious young men and women from elsewhere in North America. It won't be the escape valve for frustrated workers in areas short of jobs and long on shuttered factories - places like northern Nova Scotia and central Ontario.
Just as the global economic boom was driven by China, the Canadian economic expansion of the past decade was fired by northern Alberta. Now China is talking about 8 per cent growth, not the 11 per cent-plus of past years, and Fort McMurray is talking about more "normal" growth built on operations, not massive capital spending.
The oil sands will no longer be the strong shoulders that carry the economy. With the price of oil below $40 (U.S.) a barrel, as current construction projects finish up there will be no immediate plunge into Phase 2 expansions, and new bitumen upgraders - and that will cool activity in and around Edmonton, including in the hectic oil sands manufacturing centre of Nisku south of the city.
One case in point: Whereas 10,000 workers once laboured in building Canadian Natural Resources Ltd.'s Horizon project northwest of Fort McMurray, there were recently only 1,500 people onsite as CNRL prepares to launch its $10-billion mine and upgrader. Those 8,500 excess workers won't easily be soaked up in a slumping global economy.
And with the cancellation or delay of future capital projects, what once amounted to 24,000 mobile workers' jobs in the oil sands are now in jeopardy.
"If you are 22 years old and you're moving up there, and you plan to work there till you're 30, this downturn is not a good thing," says Joseph Doucet, professor of energy policy at the University of Alberta's business school in Edmonton.
Indeed, the downturn accentuates the split between permanent operations workers and the shadowy class of temporary workers, who are flown in, put up in housing and paid royally by the companies. The permanent people, who run existing mines, steam-assisted gravity drainage (SagD) sites and upgraders for companies like Suncor, Syncrude Canada Ltd. or Shell Canada Ltd., like the idea of fewer traffic jams or shorter waiting times in doctors' offices.
They welcome lower costs for housing although that is still not reflected yet in actual prices. The average sale price on a Fort McMurray house last month was almost $690,000 (Canadian), up from $641,000 a year ago, says Milly Quark, a Royal LePage agent and head of the local real estate board. The downturn is actually "a bit of a relief," says Mayor Melissa Blake of Wood Buffalo Regional Municipality, which includes Fort McMurray - population 65,000. (If you include the camp workers on site, the population balloons to more than 90,000.) The lull, she says, gives the overheated community a chance to cool off and finish much needed infrastructure projects, such as a wider bridge across the Athabasca River bottleneck.
"People are still working. Anybody with a permanent operations-related job is not at risk. So the relative economy here is stable," she says. She knows the shadow work force is in danger. But this temporary population puts heavy stresses on Wood Buffalo's roads, hospitals and municipal services without paying local taxes. Now with the boom on hold, "they are probably the most at-risk population after the construction projects are finished."
So if the downturn is not catastrophic for Fort Mac, it is devastating for many communities that have been exporting their young men and women to the oil sands - places like Marystown, Nfld.; Donkin, N.S.; Prince Albert, Sask.; and Wainwright, Alta.
In fact, the end of the oil sands boom could most seriously hurt the rest of Alberta, which, according to the Oil Sands Developers Group, an industry association, typically generates 52 per cent of the mobile work force in northern Alberta.
In the past, rural communities could export their labourers, but they would not lose all the purchasing power. The normal routine for mobile workers is to spend 20 days in Fort McMurray and go home for 10 days, which means they can still buy new ATVs, pickups, and widescreen TVs in their home communities.
The mobile work force contributed about $150-million a year to the Fort McMurray economy, according to the Oil Sands Developers - in restaurant meals, hotel rooms, casino chips, and drinks in watering holes like the Diggers bar in the Oilsands Hotel ("Metal detectors in use" warns the sign on the entrance wall). And local homeowners could earn $1,200 a month by just renting out a room.
A lot of that income will dry up now, as will the wealth transfer to the rest of Canada. Assume the average mobile worker might bring home $25,000 in surplus cash to spend at home in Fredericton or New Glasgow, N.S. Those 24,000 jobs could potentially channel more than $600-million a year from Fort McMurray to the rest of Canada - or to Latin America and China, which contribute a small percentage of oil sands labourers. And that's not counting the vast oil sands supply chain of equipment and materials.
It is one of the best equalization mechanisms outside government transfers. But now the workers will be coming home and putting pressure on their home economies. Young men and women had put education on hold while grabbing six-figure incomes in the sands. Now, there will be increased demand for schooling and retraining. The supply of skilled jobs is often controlled by major trade unions, which in the past, would make up for any scarce skills by phoning union locals across the country. There will be fewer of those calls now, and fewer travel cards giving non-Alberta workers access to plum oil sands jobs.
The best measure of the severity of the oil sands slump will come this spring when Syncrude, which employs more than 5,000 people in the oil sands, renews its three-year retention bonus, which pays workers up to $20,000 a year just to stay where they are.
In a once-booming oil sands, workers might have sniffed at this status quo payout and jumped to another employer for more money - or retired to Kelowna or St. John's. But in a Fort McMurray that has come suddenly down to earth, many people will probably stay put for now.

Full text:   Soccer has rapidly displaced minor-league hockey as the community's sport of choice. Gone are the glory days of shinny, wrist shots, power lessons - and dreams of making the NHL, reports Peter Cheney
When Canada's world junior hockey team took to the ice yesterday, the Toronto area was well represented - by nearly a third of the roster. There were players from Maple, Oakville and King City. Woodbridge, too. But there were no players from Scarborough.
Comedian Mike Myers's street-hockey skits may have made Scarborough a famous hockey town, but that reality has been replaced with a new one. In Scarborough, hockey is rapidly becoming the game of the past.
"It's what we grew up with, but the new kids aren't playing it," says Colleen McInroy, whose 15-year-old son plays with the Scarborough Young Bruins. "They're playing other sports. It's sad."
Ms. McInroy reflected on the fate of the game at Scarborough Gardens Arena, a facility that opened its doors in 1967. Then, Scarborough was home to one of the busiest minor-hockey associations in Canada, with 10,000 registered players.
Things have changed since then. The Gardens, on Birchmount just off Kingston Road, used to be packed. Now, the stands are nearly empty most nights, and few of the young players that take to the ice are locals. The once-thriving Scarborough Hockey Association has followed a trajectory that could be compared to that of the North American car industry. Over the past two decades, the number of players has fallen nearly 75 per cent, from 10,000 to about 2,800.
"It's hard to watch," SHA president John Kelloway says. "This is not happy situation."
The decline of hockey in Scarborough is the result of a sweeping demographic and economic change that has altered the face of the community - and the fate of Canada's national game. In the 1950s and 60s, Scarborough was a WASP bastion where homes echoed to the voice of Foster Hewitt and bedroom walls were papered with Bobby Orr and Dave Keon posters.
That has rapidly given way to a new, multi-ethnic reality that includes everything from Tamils to Tanzanians to Armenians. From 1961 to 1970, new immigrants made up just 6 per cent of Scarborough's population. By the 1980s, that figure had more than doubled, to 14 per cent. And, according to the 2006 Statistics Canada census, the number is now more than 34 per cent.
Scarborough's fastest-growing new cultural group is South Asian, which has more than tripled since 1996. They have brought with them a new sporting universe, where the heroes are not Sidney Crosby and Wayne Gretzky, but soccer icon David Beckham and cricket superstar Imran Khan.
Soccer has rapidly displaced hockey as Scarborough's sport of choice. There are about 11,000 players registered. The Scarborough Soccer Association has nearly 8,000, and an estimated 3,000 belong to other organizations, including Tamil and Chinese leagues.
The signs of soccer's ascent are easy to find.
Clairlea, once a hockey arena, was converted to an indoor two-pad soccer pitch, now called the Scarborough Soccer Centre, in 1992. The soccer centre, just off Warden Avenue, is part of a trend - 18 years ago, there were just two indoor soccer fields in the GTA. Now, there are more than 30.
"This is a highly ethnic community," says John DeBenedictis, owner of a soccer store called JMT Metrosport. "They're going to pick soccer because that's what they grew up with."
His thesis was borne out at the Metro Sports Centre indoor pitch, a disused factory off Birchmount that has been lined with Astroturf. At a night soccer practice recently, there were hundreds of young boys and girls on hand. Among them was the nine-year-old son of Errol Viegas, a technical systems manager who immigrated to Canada after a childhood in Tanzania, where soccer was the only game in town. "Everyone played," Mr. Viegas says. "To me, soccer is the No. 1 game in the world. I love it."
On the bleacher behind him was soccer dad Tom Hendry, raised in Scotland, and a soccer fanatic. Next to him was John Allen, a 51-year-old playwright who grew up playing hockey in the Great Toronto Hockey League, but chose soccer for his nine-year-old son.
"To me, hockey represents the worst part of our culture," Mr. Allen says. "I had enough of it. I got sick of the Omega Man hockey dads. You'd see them in the hockey jackets, smoking outside the rink, waiting for the Porsche they're going to get when their kid signs with the NHL."
Cultural change is not the only obstacle that hockey faces. There is also the matter of rising costs. Marty Cairns, a chartered accountant who has coached in the GTHL, says the average annual cost of a season in the Double-A division, including team fees, equipment and travel, runs from $5,000 to more than $8,000. Triple-A can cost twice that.
"I don't know how people do it," Mr. Cairns says as he watches his 16-year-old son, Ryan, play at Scarborough Gardens Arena. "Not everyone has enough money for this."
The cost of hockey is a problem that afflicts the entire GTA. And it all comes down to real estate. Land in the Toronto area is some of the most expensive in the country, and virtually all of it is spoken for. There are only 52 arenas in the GTA, and it has been more than two decades since a new one was built. Ice time costs more than anywhere else in Canada - some private arenas charge nearly $300 an hour.
For many new Canadians, the cost of hockey makes the sport a non-starter.
Alex Oprea grew up itching to play Canada's national sport, only to be frozen out by its economics. So he played soccer instead. "My parents couldn't afford hockey," he says. "I wish I could have played, but I didn't. That was our life."
Mr. Oprea, now a 28-year-old teacher, came to Canada as a child from Albania. Both his parents were engineers, but their credentials weren't recognized, limiting the family's income. Their story was typical of Scarborough in the 1980s and 1990s. "Everyone I knew was like us," Mr. Oprea says.
For Scarborough hockey, the results have been cataclysmic. In the past two years alone, three hockey house leagues have folded because of falling enrolment. One of them was the Scarborough Young Leafs, which dated to the 1940s.
"A lot of history is going down the tubes," Mr. Kelloway says. "But it's hard to stop what's happening. There are a lot of things going against us."

Full text:   At this time of year, lawyers at the high-flying firm Dreier LLP might normally step out of their Park Avenue offices and stroll a few blocks south to the Ferrari dealership to pick up a nice set of wheels. But - to paraphrase a Christmas classic - not a creature is stirring these days at the East 55th Street car showroom.
As if Wall Street's swoon and Bernard Madoff's swindles hadn't already dulled the consumptive spirit of the season, last week more than 200 Dreier lawyers lost their jobs when the firm announced it was shutting down, all of them unwitting victims of the malfeasance of their boss, Marc Dreier, whose alleged massive fraud cheated investors out of more than $450-million.
But if times are bad at Ferrari, they may prove to be very good for the city's restaurant industry. During an appearance last week on the Leonard Lopate Show , a popular noontime radio program on the local NPR affiliate WNYC, the French Culinary Institute's founder Dorothy Hamilton said that, since the collapse of Lehman Bros. in September, admission inquiries at her school had doubled from 500 to 1,000 per week. "If you've lost your job in finance, what are you going to do? Look for another job in finance? I don't think so!" she crowed.
In the last few years especially, lawyers and finance professionals who were left unfulfilled by their white-collar jobs have been cashing out and opening up many of the city's bars and restaurants.
With that wave projected to grow, Hamilton sounded almost giddy at her good fortune. It was a little unbecoming.
It's true, many high-end dining rooms have been quiet this fall, and experts are forecasting gloom for the beginning of the year, with dozens of places closing, but foodies are licking their chops at the prospect of the falling real-estate market removing one of the major obstacles to restaurant survival. (Last week, the parent company of Honey declared bankruptcy. Reports suggested the move was designed, in part, to negotiate more favourable rents.)
Like many others, Hamilton suggested that New Yorkers' definition of "tough times" tends to be relative. Sure, they'll be cutting back on their Hamptons house shares, but tight money isn't suddenly going to mend their famed estrangement with their kitchens. They'll just be looking for better value when they eat out.
Affordable is the new buzzword: Last month, when I interviewed the Toronto super-chef Susur Lee about his New York outpost, Shang, which he was about to open at the Thompson Hotel on the Lower East Side, he used the word about half a dozen times. Tom Valenti, a popular chef who led the charge for good restaurants on the once culinarily barren Upper West Side, is still serving entrees in the $30 to $40 range at his bistro Ouest, but his new neighbourhood place the West Branch is specializing in comfort food at about half that price. It's an instant hit: On an average weeknight, you can easily wait an hour for a table.
The co-host of the reality show Top Chef , Tom Colicchio, said on the Lopate Show that good restaurants will survive if they know how to provide value. Colicchio, a straight-shooting laser-eyed chef who runs three restaurants in town and others around the country, has apparently become an inspirational figure among those mulling a career change: Like Woodward and Bernstein in All the President's Men , who spurred thousands of American kids into making a living scribbling for newspapers, Top Chef and its cooking reality-show siblings are apparently making kitchen work look glamorous. Anyone who has ever worked in a restaurant would find this hilarious, but then reality TV's grip on reality has always been tenuous.
As if to prove the point, last week's episode of Top Chef featured a Christmas-themed party in which guests and the "cheftestants" repeatedly wished each other merry Christmas and happy holidays, even though they were shooting the episode in high summer.
The same episode touched off a minor scandal among fans after the actor Cheyenne Jackson was shown calling a scallop dish cooked by one of the contestants, "too slimy." A Top Chef fan (who, naturally, blogs) noted that episode outtakes on the website of the U.S. channel Bravo suggested producers had inverted the truth. Jackson in fact had said that, while he normally doesn't like scallops because they're, "too slimy," he'd actually liked this dish.
That wasn't the only scandalous behaviour on the part of the producers. The show's penchant for product placement, normally merely shameless, reached into the stratosphere of immorality when one of the contestants was permitted to call his family to check on the health of his father, who has cancer. While the intimate conversation unfolded, the Top Chef camera focused sharply, and at length, on the shiny Sidekick LX cellphone in his hand. (What cancer? I want me a
Sidekick!)
Still, that's nothing compared to the real-life scandals of the local restaurant industry. Earlier this month, a bitter ex-employee of Colicchio's sued him and his company for a tasting menu's worth of employee mistreatment. The waitress Nessa Rapone, who joined Craftbar in March, 2007, alleged in federal court filings that she and her co-workers were forced to share tips with supervisors, that the company didn't keep proper time records, that it failed to pay workers overtime, and that when she questioned those policies she was fired.
The company maintains that an investigation will clear it of any wrongdoing.
But Colicchio isn't the only restaurateur in the spotlight for the wrong reasons. Earlier this month Simon and Michelle Nget, the owners of Saigon Grill, were arrested and charged with more than 400 criminal counts, including failing to pay minimum wage, falsifying records and demanding illegal payments from their deliverymen. Even before those charges, a judge had ordered them to pay $4.6-million (U.S.) to compensate employees for wage violations.
Crooks and liars in the hospitality industry? After working for their disgraced boss, all those out-of-work lawyers from Dreier LLP should feel right at home.

Full text:   It makes a big-screen opening this week, but this Nazi relic is a spectacle in itself
There is a scene in the upcoming Tom Cruise movie, Valkyrie , when a host of German soldiers musters in a vast courtyard. The looming walls could only be one place, for only one place in Berlin can make so many people look small: Tempelhof Airport, one of Europe's largest buildings.
On Oct. 30, the storied airfield (long superseded by other local airports) closed to winged traffic, its many square kilometres of prime Berlin real estate destined for some kind of redevelopment. But the building itself remains open for walking tours.
Typical of Nazi-era architecture, Tempelhof's main building was built to last all 1,000 years of Hitler's Reich. A short walk from the U-bahn stop at Platz der Luftbrucke, the first view is a city block of art deco limestone, itself only a small part of a complex that goes on and on and on. Don't even bother photographing the exterior unless you have a satellite. The curving arms of the terminal span 1.2 kilometres, and the complex encompasses three million square feet.
But it is Tempelhof's past that most evokes a sense of wonder, both as a monument to the banality of evil and as a symbol of hope. The 2½-hour walking tour is something of an endurance test, but it's time well-spent for military buffs or anyone interested in history.
Even film history. Directed by Bryan Singer, Valkyrie tracks a real plot by German officers to assassinate Hitler late in the war. The entrance to Tempelhof's secret underground railway poses as the forecourt on a German base. Singer is by no means the first director to harness Tempelhof's dramatic potential. Billy Wilder shot two films here, A Foreign Affair (1948) and One, Two, Three (1961), during its reign as Berlin's commercial aviation hub.
More than an airport, Tempelhof was the nexus of Nazi air power. How many airports have not one but two aircraft factories? Here slave labourers constructed the Stuka dive bomber and the top-secret Focke Wulf 190 fighter plane - and often attempted to sabotage them.
Tempelhof's strategic value led to intense fighting during the battle for Berlin. Its fortified vaults contained the majority of German aerial reconnaissance, millions of feet of nitrate film stock. The Russian army blasted its way in, igniting the highly flammable film into a conflagration that burned for 11 days. Drooping metal doorframes speak to the intensity of the fire.
Farther down, in a distant sub-basement, air raid shelters bear the weight of history as well. Separated from their parents, the children of air force officers had their own chambers. On the walls, jolly illustrations and a children's verse are still clearly visible. You were safe here, at least from instant death by bombing - but not from the rolling thunder of the Russian advance.
Tempelhof also played a pivotal role at the beginning of the Cold War, during the Russian Army's 1948 blockade of Berlin. As the principal airport in Allied-occupied West Berlin, it was a lifeline for one million Berliners who would otherwise have faced a grim choice between starvation and capitulation. The tour ends in the now-silent terminal building, before a mural celebrating the U.S. Air Force's Candy Bombers, the crewmen who organized air drops of chocolate for young Berliners.
Later, Tempelhof became a U.S. air base and home to several hundred American soldiers, many of whom left graffiti on the blackened beams of the burned-out film vaults. The American presence lends the tour one of its more surreal moments. You're led into a huge darkened room. The fluorescent tubes flicker on overhead - and you find yourself in a basketball gym. Down a corridor, a huge lounge sits like a museum diorama of the 1970s. This is where the Cold Warriors kicked back until the Wall came down.
Small wonder the Berlin government has no clue what to do with this colossus. Three million square feet of blackened vaults, air raid shelters, basketball courts and an airline terminal no one uses. Demolition will probably take longer than the construction. Best to have a look before it truly is history.

Full text:   Policy-makers have cause to worry about excess saving, but shoppers have a golden opportunity to become savvier
If lifestyle journalism is any indication, there will be a lot of homemade crafts, cookies and coupons for hugs under people's trees this Thursday. I've seen umpteen bargain holiday articles, exhorting me to embrace the new frugal cool, and scrapbook, pickle or knit offerings for my loved ones. Even Oprah eschewed her yearly Giftmas orgy of high-end indulgences in favour of a thrifty parade of gratitude boxes and mixed CDs.
Conspicuous consumption suddenly seems so pre-meltdown.
The last weekend before Christmas is usually a retail zenith, as the regulars and the shopping-averse rush the stores in search of seasonal swag. This year, it is a bellwether, too, as business analysts and economic wonks are watching, waiting to see if the first credit-crunched Christmas season portends a significant reduction in consumer spending.
Recent polls show Canadian consumer confidence is declining. Last month, the Conference Board said it was down to 71 per cent, a low the likes of which have not been seen since the recessions of 1990 and 1982. TNS Global, a market-research firm, was projecting small upticks in consumer confidence earlier this fall, but now they're posting an 84 on their index, a 20-point drop from December of 2007.
Some - like many commenters on The Globe's website - have chastised the media for its Chicken Little coverage of the financial crisis. Don't you know panic begets panic, silly scribes? Market losses and real-estate devaluations hurt, but they hardly compare to the mass unemployment of the Dirty Thirties. It's not as if we were buying pencils and apples from our friendly local soot-stained urchins - not yet.
On both sides of the 49th parallel, the malls remain packed, but retailers have been slashing prices. According to analysts at the TD Bank, Canadian retail sales have actually increased slightly, by 0.1 per cent, but that was offset by a one-point drop in prices.
Merchants are biting into their margins to keep the merch moving - or, in TD's words, "This technique has worked, but barely."
Retailers are trying to entice trepidatious consumers to keep on spending like Santa, because they are really saving like Scrooge. You can't afford not to buy the flat screen at 40 per cent off! Time and the tills will tell whether this pitch is as effective as other classic save-by-spending shills, such as "monster home for nothing down and 40 years of EZ payments."
One survey, by the marketing firm Maritz Consultants, found that Canadians planned to reduce their holiday outlay by 14 per cent. The top three stores that respondents said they were likely to visit were decidedly down-market: Wal-Mart, Zellers and Canadian Tire. The good old hockey sweater from Eaton's has been supplanted by bulk drums of sweatshop snacks, deeply discounted Xbox games and housewares, what with many planning to stay in and stare at their screens until things pick up again, some time in 2010.
BUNDLES OF BINDLES
The popularity of such discount stores is perfectly in keeping with the el-cheapo brands that are prevailing in the U.S. recession, such as Spam, Campbell's Soup and McDonald's. Anything poor people buy is a solid investment bet right now, as global markets seem very bullish on poverty. Ask your broker to look into meat-like foodstuffs, drugs, booze, harmonicas and bindles.
American consumer confidence has been in the doldrums for months, with surveys showing dismal digits that recall the lows of the early eighties. However, the Conference Board reported that U.S. consumer confidence actually inched up in November, rising to 44.9 (the 1985 level being the benchmark, at 100), from its all-time nadir of 38.8 in October.
And think, it took only cheaper gas, the historic election of a cool new president, nearly interest-free money and everything-must-go prices to achieve that encouraging nudge.
The American slump, and recent bump, are relevant to Canadians for a couple of reasons. First, our southern neighbours are our biggest customers, so whenever they shop less, Canadians sell less. Second, the waxing and waning of consumer confidence are part of a broader cultural shift, one that the global financial meltdown is hastening.
OUR SHOPPING INVESTMENT
We have invested a lot in shopping. Not just in an economic sense, although we have certainly done that too, taking on unprecedented levels of household debt to finance the spend-a-thon. But we have also asked shopping to serve as much more than an efficient way of availing ourselves of goods and services.
Retail successes of the nineties, such as Starbucks, sold us shopping as an experience and the store as a destination. At the same time, other retailers such as Wal-Mart stripped away the atmosphere and were equally successful marketing themselves as pure, frippery-free cheapness. Consumerism became diffuse and diabolical enough to produce a panoply of goods that allowed discerning anti-capitalists to commodify their dissent, to bum a phrase from the American journalist and author Thomas Frank.
Shopping also became a political panacea. Consumer choice was repeatedly touted as a superior substitute for other, more sluggardly forms of institutional life. The Fraser Institute, and like-minded right wing think tanks, have long prescribed shopping as the solution for rickety systems ranging from health care to education to government itself. If only those pesky, antiquated teachers, doctors and politicos could start conducting themselves like financiers or entrepreneurs! Then we would live in a veritable paradise of reason and efficiency.
But when financiers and CEOs face-planted this fall, tripped up by their mind-boggling, mendacious math, who did those masters of the universe go begging to? Certainly not to any of the new billionaires created by increased wealth concentration over the past two decades. I did not see anyone beseech Bill Gates, or the other beneficiaries of our busted bubbles, for bailout bucks. No, the poor little rich boys have been busy bawling to the stupid old governments that they have been trying to erode, evade or exploit for decades.
I do not want to exaggerate, claiming that we are entering a shining new era of trust in government. It would be laughable to say that, when Canada does not even have a functioning Parliament. Rather, it is more accurate to say that the economy is finally getting bad enough to make people entertain political solutions to our financial problems. The credit jig is up, which forces us to reconsider the balance between the public and the private, between long-term investments like education and short-term blandishments like electronics.
It is clear that the beer-and-popcorn tax cuts that once passed for stimulus policies will no longer suffice to reassure electorates spooked by global economic uncertainty. It's beginning to look a lot like Keynes-mas in America, with president-elect Barack Obama promising green tech projects and gross buckets of infrastructure spending to alleviate the pain.
Many shoppers are burned out and maxed out, suffering from the sense that it is time for someone else to charge it for a change. The seemingly indefatigable North American consumer has grown weary of serving as the economy's biggest, sturdiest engine. Sally MasterCard and Joe Visa have spent all they can and then some. It's time for governments to step up and buy some new roads and schools and hospitals, those goods that few of us can afford on our own.
Of course, I realize that "the government" is another way of saying Sally and Joe Taxpayer. And, given the way governments can rack up debts and deficits, what that really means is the Taxpayer family's offspring and grand-offspring. The least we can do, considering our continuing willingness to mortgage their future, is build things that increase their chances of enjoying that future.
Shoppers are losing confidence because they have no idea what is coming next. Analysts who discuss consumer confidence keep invoking the recessions of the ancient early eighties, when customary business-cycle anxieties may have been heightened by the birth pangs of the conservative revolution. Britain shifted first, electing Margaret Thatcher in 1979. The United States chose Ronald Reagan in 1980. Characteristically, Canadians took a few years to catch up, electing Brian Mulroney in 1984.
CANADIAN FOOTBALL
We are in a similar position now, trailing just behind our G7 friends. Canada has yet to implement or announce a stimulus package. It has been quite disheartening for many Canucks, regardless of political persuasion, to watch our leaders use this period of economic instability as a political football. The outrage on all sides is partly due to the feeling that we could desperately use some leadership right now. Or, to put this in retail terms: You can't afford to not govern, when the economy is marked down this much.
Commentators much more conservative than I have taken Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Jim Flaherty, the Minister of Finance, to task for their tin-eared response to the recession. They have looked like yesterday's men, relics from the days when the answers were tax cuts and privatization, no matter what the questions were.
North Americans have been participants in a period of consumer hubris, not consumer confidence. This over-confidence in the perpetual engine of consumption went all the way to the top. Just a few short years ago, the U.S. housing bubble was otherwise known as the ownership society. And just a few short months ago, the first rumblings of our recession were a great opportunity to snap up stock.
This goes to show how quickly things can change. I hate to use weasel words like "correction," but declining consumer confidence may not be an entirely bad change, if it helps wean people off pricey credit, if it makes us savvier shoppers, if it reduces our inflated expectations.
This fall, U.S. household debt started to shrink for the first time in more than 50 years. This does raise the possibility that Americans will get caught in Keynes's paradox of thrift, but that should not be a problem as long as Mr. Obama keeps priming the pump. And most Americans approve of his plans to do so.
Americans are facing more catastrophic conditions than we are, but their confidence is returning because they see some leadership and support glimmering at the end of the tunnel. Conversely, Canadians, who enjoy advantages such as a more stable banking system and less debt, are saddled with a bunch of petty squabbling partisans who are unable to govern, let alone govern well.
Consumer confidence depends on other kinds of confidence, like trust in the government and the financial system. And those things seem as frozen as credit, Winnipeg, and the Prime Minister's attempts to smile.
Many of our iconic holiday images, such as Charlie Brown's scrubby little tree, the Whos of Whoville singing in spite of their stolen stuff, and the birthday baby in his lowly manger, tell us that Christmas is something that does not come from a store. Neither does democracy. A recession teaches us this the hard way, but it is still a lesson worth learning.

Full text:   Black Monday, Sept. 15., will be remembered by a generation as the day the great recession that is now strangling the global economy became inevitable. On that day, the U.S. government made the fateful decision to allow Lehman Bros. to fail. But the catastrophe unleashed by Lehman's collapse has far-reaching roots in the unlikely intersection of U.S. housing policy and a fly-by-night mortgage lender that spawned a global shadow banking system
Richard Fuld sat still in his chair and stared straight ahead, facing his interrogators with a clenched jaw and the occasional flash of defiance.
He had been summoned to Washington on this chilly October morning to answer for the demise of Lehman Bros., a storied Wall Street firm that under his 15-year watch had staged a remarkable revival - and suffered an equally breathtaking collapse.
At least that was the ostensible reason. But now, as one congressman after another took turns grilling him over his lavish pay, and juxtaposing this with the financial plight of ordinary homeowners, it became clear that he had been brought here to answer for something much larger: the role of Wall Street in sparking the biggest economic meltdown in more than 80 years, a crisis that threatened not only long-lasting hardship, but a loss of faith in the very free-market system that had fashioned the country into a superpower.
"If you haven't discovered your role, you are the villain today," chided John Mica, the Republican representative from Florida. "So you have got to act like the villain here."
Mr. Fuld had been carefully chosen for the part. With his example, the lawmakers could provide angry Americans with a simple explanation of what went wrong, of how the reckless pursuit of self-interest among brokerage executives, traders, hedge funds and other financial types had fuelled the subprime mortgage binge and incited the biggest economic catastrophe since the Great Depression
The hearing was a crash course in how the financial system has evolved in the postwar era. It showed, through the prism of Lehman, how banks had moved away from traditional services, like making loans and underwriting securities, to complex and risky forms of financial engineering.
This proved to be a momentous shift in the capital markets, one that accelerated over the past decade to create what is known, ominously, as the "shadow banking system" - an unsupervised, $10-trillion (U.S.) financial playground whose size now rivals the traditional banking industry.
This was a world populated by arcane instruments like credit default swaps, special investment vehicles, and collateralized debt obligations. These instruments were spread through every corner of the financial world, and their web of interconnections was so intricate that no one - not their creators, and certainly not the investors who lapped them up in search of higher returns - could forecast the damage they might wreak if the system came under stress.
They were, as billionaire investor Warren Buffett vainly warned, "weapons of mass financial destruction."
Black Monday, the day in September that Lehman declared the biggest bankruptcy in history, will be remembered by a generation for sounding the death knell for this shadow system.
And thanks to Congress, which was looking to provide an enraged country with a healthy dose of catharsis, that same generation will likely remember Mr. Fuld as the face of Wall Street avarice and treachery - perhaps even as the face of the crisis.
This might have been good theatre, but it was a woefully incomplete explanation of how a U.S. housing problem mushroomed into a global calamity - of why countries like Iceland nearly collapsed; why chastened auto makers have trudged to Washington, hats-in-hands; why pension funds from Norway to Australia find themselves in the grip of massive deficits; of why the commodities markets have withered, stunting the growth of developing economies.
Wall Street may have created the financial architecture that abetted the crisis, but it was by no means a lone actor. Indeed, when one takes a closer look at Lehman's participation in the housing market, and how this market eventually infected whole economies, all sorts of troubling questions emerge: questions that Congress quickly glossed over in its excoriation of Mr. Fuld.
For instance, why were investment banks allowed to borrow massive amounts of money to make risky bets? How could a shadow banking system, one ten times bigger than the Canadian economy, be allowed to flourish so quickly without any oversight from government regulators? Why were credit rating agencies stamping dubious products with their approval? And how could homeowners with poor credit histories or zero documentation, let alone jobs, qualify for mortgages?
In its haste to hand Americans a villain, Washington had failed to look to itself.
NATION OF HOMEOWNERS
Home ownership has always been the most tangible embodiment of the American Dream. From the start, landless immigrants were drawn by the opportunity to own property. Later, as the country evolved from an agrarian society into a more urban one, the purchase of a home remained the key expression of upward mobility.
But home ownership wasn't merely about the collective aspirations of ordinary Americans: It was also viewed by government as an agent of social improvement and cohesion. In the 1920s, President Herbert Hoover said families who owned their own homes provided "a more wholesome, healthful and happy atmosphere in which to bring up children." His successor, Franklin D. Roosevelt, avowed that "a nation of homeowners is unconquerable."
During the Depression, millions of Americans defaulted on their mortgages, and thousands of banks collapsed. Mr. Roosevelt responded in 1934 by creating the Federal Housing Administration, an agency that provided government insurance on long-term mortgages and regulated their interest rates. These longer-amortization mortgages helped to ease down-payment amounts and made it easier for people to keep up with their monthly mortgage tabs.
The president also introduced what became known as Fannie Mae, a government agency that purchased the now federally insured mortgages from banks and other financial lenders, allowing them to issue more loans. Within the span of a couple of years, Washington had become the key player in several aspects of the mortgage market, and before long it was promising "a decent home and a suitable living environment for every American family."
The result wasn't merely an increase in home ownership levels, but a shift in expectations. With government making it an explicit policy goal, home ownership became less about aspiration and more about entitlement - regardless of whether people had the means to pay for a house or not.
It wasn't long before popular culture reflected this sentiment. Who can forget George Bailey, Jimmy Stewart's character in the 1946 film It's a Wonderful Life , upbraiding the slumlord Mr. Potter, who wanted to scrap home loans for the poor?
This dream of home ownership took root in the postwar years, and ownership levels rose steadily, buoyed in large part by the flowering of suburbs across the country. By the late 1970s, however, this policy of enfranchisement via property hit a snag.
In 1977, President Jimmy Carter moved to make housing more affordable by requiring banks to lend in low-income neighbourhoods. But before the decade was out, the scheme was stymied by record-high interest rates, courtesy of an inflation-fighting Federal Reserve Board.
Savings and loans institutions (or "thrifts"), which accounted for more than half of all mortgage lending, faced limits on the amount of interest they could charge on mortgages, as did conventional banks. When the Federal Reserve rate shot up to 10.3 per cent in 1979, almost double what it had been three years earlier, many lenders found themselves in a pinch. In some states, market interest rates were higher than the ceiling on mortgage rates, meaning banks and savings and loans institutions would actually lose money when they offered a loan. So in many cases they didn't.
The roadblock inspired a pair of policy responses that would ultimately lay the foundation for the ascendancy of subprime mortgages.
Congress responded first with the Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act, a sweeping piece of legislation passed in 1980. The most far-reaching part of the act concerned mortgages: DIDMCA would scrap state usury limits on mortgages, allowing lenders to charge whatever they wanted. Moreover, the act would wipe out these rate limits for any company - regardless of whether it accepted deposits - that lent more than $1-million a year.
"This ... is the statute that ultimately set the stage for the subprime home equity lending industry of today," Cathy Lesser Mansfield, a professor at Drake University, wrote in her 2000 examination of usury deregulation. There was virtually no discussion in Congress, she noted, of what sort of predatory lending tactics might take hold if mortgage rate ceilings were eliminated.
DIDMCA on its own didn't revive slumping house sales. With interest rates so high, and the country tipping into recession, fewer Americans were enticed to borrow. Once again, a desperate Congress sought to revive the market with deregulation. In 1982, shortly after Ronald Reagan came to power with his laissez-faire convictions, the U.S. government moved again, introducing the Alternative Mortgage Transaction Parity Act.
Congress noted that the rate environment was making it difficult for consumers to get long-term, fixed-rate mortgages, so it further loosened the rules, allowing lenders to promote a hodge-podge of "alternative" mortgage features. These included adjustable-rate mortgages, "negative amortization" loans (whereby borrowers don't pay off the principal), and "balloon" mortgages (which oblige borrowers to make a large payment at the end of the loan's maturity in exchange for lower monthly charges).
These "alternative" mortgages figure prominently in the current crisis, either through predatory lending, or poor risk controls, or hidden punitive charges that tipped people into foreclosure. Taken together, these two legislative overhauls opened the door wide for small consumer finance companies to pile into the mortgage business and begin peddling exotic, high-interest loans. Several of these upstart companies were already busy at work, waiting for just such a break.
FROM DREAM TO NIGHTMARE
Brian Chisick was always a salesman. Born in London, England, he moved to Vancouver with his parents at age 14, but dropped out of Kitsilano Secondary School after Grade 10 to start making money. Tanned and fit, with a jutting jaw and barrel chest, he turned his hand to peddling a variety of products.
By the late 1960s, Mr. Chisick and his wife, Sarah, had landed in Los Angeles, right in the middle of the postwar housing boom. They soon found something new to flog - loans.
Demand for loans was high, but regulations were tight and banks weren't interested in lending to people who didn't have a solid credit background.
Mr. Chisick gravitated to "hard money" lending: second mortgages and loans to people turned down by banks. Rates were slightly higher and the loans were secured by "hard" assets, such as cars or furniture.
After learning the ropes at a variety of hard-money outfits, in the late 1970s, Mr. Chisick and his wife co-founded First Alliance Corp.
His timing was perfect. The changes introduced by presidents Carter and Reagan in the early 1980s allowed Mr. Chisick to charge higher rates, and then use these to tempt investors into buying the loans he issued.
His pitch was a simple version of what he and other mortgage originators would later turn into the engine of the subprime machine. Investors would get the monthly payments from borrowers, whose loans carried a higher interest rate than bank mortgages. Mr. Chisick took the money from the resale of the loans, plus a fee, and then made more loans.
Finding borrowers wasn't hard. Mr. Chisick put dozens of ads in small papers and mailed out stacks of flyers. Finding investors proved more difficult. Mr. Chisick bought lists of potential investors, and then called them one by one to pitch the benefits of buying a loan.
Within a few years, First Alliance had half a dozen loan officers and a dozen investment counsellors - small-time, low-ranking salesman. Later, as First Alliance and other originators grew, the salesman role would be assumed by high-powered Wall Street investment bankers, at Lehman and other blue-chip firms.
Mr. Chisick's model was so clever and that it wasn't long before others around Orange County began to take note. They helped start nearly a dozen subprime lenders, including eventual giants Option One Mortgage Co., New Century Financial Corp. and Ameriquest Mortgage Co. Over in another Los Angeles suburb, Countrywide Financial Corp. was launched.
But for the regulators that would later do battle with many of those companies, Mr. Chisick remains the godfather to the subprime lending world.
"We always say [the Chisicks] were the start of it all," says Chuck Cross, former director of the consumer services office in Washington state. "They were the first of the big bad predatory lenders. In many ways they were much worse than some of the big ones like Ameriquest to come along in subsequent years."
Mr. Chisick secured notoriety with regulators because of the savvy marketing techniques that he perfected. He also displayed an early knack for getting firms such as Prudential Securities and Lehman to help bankroll him.
To target borrowers, Mr. Chisick developed a profile of the most likely First Alliance customer: middle-class, preferably white, in his or her late 50s. The best candidates had been in their homes at least 10 years, and had built up about 30 per cent equity in their property. But most crucially, these people had other consumer loans or had fallen behind on tax payments and were therefore viewed as unattractive risks, or subprime borrowers, in the eyes of traditional lenders.
Mr. Chisick believed these borrowers would be the most receptive to his brand of high-priced second mortgages and loans. And if they ran into trouble, First Alliance would get a property with substantial equity.
Mr. Chisick spent up to $20-million annually to locate people who fit this profile. By the late 1980s, the company was sending 1.9 million pieces of mail every month to neighbourhoods carefully targeted from local tax records, real estate databases and credit records. He even bought lists of people who were delinquent on their taxes. "We would call them to see if we could give them some money," he said in a deposition in 2002.
A month's worth of mailings generated about 2,500 inquiries, which were fielded by a team of telemarketers. All promising prospects were referred to First Alliance's loan officers, who typically generated about 270 loans from each monthly mailing, according to documents filed in court.
The loan officers were the linchpin of the operation. Most were former car salesmen, well schooled in slick pitches. Each officer had to memorize a script, called the Track Manual, that outlined a 13-step presentation that was made to potential borrowers. To make sure they got it right, Mr. Chisick put new recruits through four weeks of videotaped rehearsals and role-playing with other officers.
The objective of the Track was to obfuscate the fees and terms of a First Alliance loan. For example, according to court filings, step 8 in the Track - dubbed "The Monster" - "tells the loan originator to divert the consumers' attention from the loan transaction that they are about to sign onto."
One judge later said the presentation "was so well performed that borrowers had no idea they were being charged points and other fees and costs averaging 11 per cent above the amount they thought they had agreed to borrow."
While most banks were lucky to make $4,000 in fees on a $100,000 loan, First Alliance pocketed as much as $20,000, according to state regulators.
By selling these second mortgages - essentially refinancings - Mr. Chisick had turned government policy on its head. He wasn't putting more people in homes, but encouraging homeowners who were already deemed at-risk by traditional lenders to take on additional debt.
This wasn't all that easy to do amid a depressed economy and soaring interest rates. But once again, luck intervened for Mr. Chisick in the form of Washington lawmakers. Until 1986, Americans could deduct interest payments on most types of consumer loans. But under President Reagan, the government wanted to simplify taxation and eliminate a range of shelters. Interest deductibility was no longer allowed, unless -and this was a big exception - it was the interest consumers were paying on their first or second homes.
Not surprisingly, people began to use their homes as piggybanks. Why take out a separate loan when you could borrow against your house, and be able to write off your interest payments?
Calculations by Ms. Mansfield of Drake University show that home equity loans grew from "virtually nothing" in 1983 to "about $40-billion" by the end of 1986, while second mortgage indebtedness more than doubled to a record high of about $150-billion in 1986. And by 1988, a scant two years after the tax code was changed, 68 per cent of home equity loans were used to fund things other than home improvements, compared with just 35 per cent in 1984, according to another study.
A BAD PROBLEM GETS WORSEAs companies like Mr. Chisick's grew exponentially thanks to the regulatory changes made during the 1980s, Wall Street reacted by devising new and more complicated ways to help them sell their loans to investors.
The most crucial innovation was the privately issued mortgage-backed security. In the old days of banking, a lender would issue a mortgage, and then hold it on its books until the loan was paid off. But now Wall Street saw a way to generate ever more lending revenue - it could pool these mortgages, turn them into tradable securities, and sell them to large investors.
Banks, thrifts, and mortgage originators like Mr. Chisick, meanwhile, could create a lending assembly line: By selling off their loans, they continually freed up room to issue more of them.
Securitization in itself was not a new phenomenon. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two quasi-governmental mortgage giants, had securitized mortgages and sold them to investors, but there was a big difference: These were mortgages backstopped by the U.S. government, thus viewed as safe for conservative investors such as life insurance companies, investment managers and pension funds.
In the mid-1980s, credit rating agencies began to rate the emerging, primitive form of mortgage-backed securities. This imprimatur encouraged large investors to begin dipping a toe in the market. Between 1984 and 1988, the percentage of home mortgages that were securitized jumped from 23 per cent to 52 per cent.
As the demand for these securities grew, lenders in turn sought more and more people to put in homes, a dangerous spiral that would inevitably force them to scavenge for loans among borrowers with dubious credit quality - the type Mr. Chisick's company targeted.
Suddenly, mortgage finance companies like First Alliance demonstrated massive growth. Regulatory sea-shifts had allowed them to waltz into the housing market and charge whatever they wanted for mortgages. The interest-deductibility change effectively turned homes into automated teller machines, and companies like First Alliance were only too happy to step up with the money for refinancing - again, at rates of their choice.
And Wall Street's securitization engine, though still in its infancy, began pumping out mortgage securities so quickly that lenders were scrambling to write more new mortgages to keep up with investors' demand.
In 1977, these little consumer finance companies owned a mere 0.5 per cent of the home equity loan market. But by the end of the 1980s, they had 32 per cent.
The Chisicks became multimillionaires. They bought a 5,000-square-foot mansion in Anaheim and had a $2-million house in Los Angeles and a condo in Hawaii. They became active in the Jewish community and made big donations, including one that put the Chisick name on a local auditorium.
Indeed, the real estate grab was so lucrative that pretty much everyone - brokers, lenders, investors and rating agencies - increasingly turned a blind eye to the risks. And why not? If banks were no longer holding onto these mortgages, and brokers were simply finding them for a fee, what did they care if borrowers eventually found themselves unable to pay the bills?
Although home ownership was reaching record levels, the government's series of rule changes had unwittingly charted a dangerous new course - one that, in the recent testimony of a former high-ranking mortgage executive, would transform the dream of owning a home into a nightmare of foreclosure.

Abstract: Patrick Suskind (Vintage) is one of those books to which you just can't help returning. Dark, disturbing and incredibly well written, it's a gaudy tale of horror, yet it avoids obvious "slasher" shock tactics in favour of a deep, developing terror from one man's obsession to explore the sense that is his very raison d'être, the sense of smell.

SETH
It's Chris Ware's The Acme Novelty Library , number 19 (Acme Novelty Library). Though this small oblong hardcover is in fact a periodical of sorts, and does contain a serialized segment of a much longer work in progress, do not allow these facts to prevent you from purchasing it. The story within its covers is entirely self-contained and fully satisfying as a complete work. If the number 19 were not displayed on the spine you would have no idea whatsoever that this is but a small section in a grand work to come. And a remarkable work it is.
The "graphic novel" is broken into two parts. In one half we observe William "Woody" Brown, a failed science-fiction writer/high school English teacher as he reflects back on a disastrous first love that has shaped (or perhaps misshaped) his entire adult life. In the other half of the story, we read Woody's first science fiction novella, The Seeing Eye Dogs of Mars. The two halves mirror each other and produce a work of remarkable complexity and emotional impact. A work about time and memory and how the past never really vanishes and how we are shaped by hurt. Ware also pulls off a very difficult stunt: He lets us know that Woody has written a excellent and well received science fiction story and then he has the bravado to produce that story for us to read - and yes, it is terrific.
As with all of Ware's works, the book is exquisite in its design, its drawing and its production. The real genius is in the storytelling techniques Ware uses - breaking every action down to its smallest gesture - revealing the subtle power of the comics medium in the hands of a master cartoonist. This is, hands down, the best "comic book" you will read this year. I think it might simply be the best book, period.

The most mesmerizing novel I read this year was Lawrence Hill's The Book of Negroes (HarperCollins). I found it historically and rhetorically magnetic all the way through and it left a powerful imprint when I'd finished. Magnificent.
In non-fiction, I revelled in Wilfrid Sheed's The House That George Built (Random House), a wonderful mix of fact and anecdote about the magical musical landscape George Gershwin, Irving Berlin, Cole Porter, Duke Ellington, Hoagy Carmichael and others created and inhabited. And for sheer fun, I loved Christopher Buckley's wry Supreme Courtship (Twelve), about the politics behind filling an American Supreme Court vacancy. Fiction, of course...
WILLIAM BRYANT LOGAN
Last New Year's Day, I was at a party where I met a philosopher. After expressing my surprise and pleasure at his existence - I thought such jobs had been outsourced to the economists - I told him about my delight in reading Jacques Maritain. The real world is not the world of objects, taught Maritain, but rather the world of subjects. This was the most freeing piece of news I'd got in years.
"If you like Maritain," responded my philosopher acquaintance, "you should read Gabriel Marcel."
"Who?" I asked. Never heard of him.
Well, I've heard of him now. Two volumes of his 1949-50 lectures at Aberdeen University were published in 1951 as The Mystery of Being . In the same year came the chilling Man Against Mass Society . You can find an introductory selection of his essays published as Creative Fidelity (Fordham University Press, 2002).
Marcel goes Maritain one better. There are two ways to experience the world, he writes, either as a problem or as a mystery. A mystery is by its nature not resolvable. "A problem," he writes, "is something I run up against, something that bars the way. A mystery, however, is something in which I find myself involved."
Marcel invites us into real relationship to others not as a virtuous or moral thing, but as our only way into the real world. As human beings, he writes, "We are always in a situation." We cannot step outside of it. We cannot grasp or say what anything finally means. On the other hand, we can meet, experience and meditate, the more the better.
Marcel was a well-known dramatist and a gifted musician, as well as a philosopher, so his writing is not easy, but neither is it dry and dull. He often will write a sentence that I chew on for weeks. For example: "Whatever can be catalogued is an occasion for despair."
Or "Existence, strictly speaking, is not conceivable."
Or "I must somehow make room for the other in myself."
I am looking forward to this New Year's Day, in the hope that my philosopher acquaintance will be there again. I will embarrass him with effusive thanks. And who knows what he will give me next?

We are not here to be happy. We are here to be of service.
If this was ever said to you, even in jest, while growing up then, Good To a Fault, by Marina Endicott (Freehand Books) is the perfect read for you.
What motivates our good behaviour? Are we in fact selfish in our choices to do good? Are we seeking recognition for our good deeds?
A wise friend said: Do your work; expect nothing in return; celebrate your accomplishment and start again. If you choose to do a good deed, good for you. I loved the book.
The Man Who Made Vermeers: Unvarnishing the Legend of Master Forger Han van Meegeren , by Jonathan Lopez (Harcourt) is a fascinating account of how the trade in fake Dutch art was conducted between the two Great Wars.
In the 1960s, we still believed that van Meegeren was a clever man who duped Hermann Goering and a gullible art world. This book looks deeply below the surface and chillingly exposes a Nazi sympathizer. Most frightening is Goering's pronouncement, "The People can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders, that is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and then denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same in any country."

BUFFY SAINTE-MARIE
My pick is The Female Brain by Dr. Louann Brizendine (Broadway Books). Talk about a conversation starter! Did you know that all fetuses start off female? Or that until very recently, the only brains that had been studied had been male? Seems like everybody just assumed that female brains were the same as male brains, only a little smaller and a little bit broken. Not so. Both are perfectly designed for the survival of the owner and the species to which we belong. In my opinion, both would work together better if their owners read The Female Brain .
I've bought this book over and over and always bring a copy as a giveaway when I travel.

LAURA LIPPMAN
With books, as in the relationships of my youth, I can never decide if I ask for too much or too little. I want a good story, well told, with characters who seem recognizably human. Is that so much to ask? Sometimes, it seems that way. Even though I didn't read anywhere near enough in 2008, I read enough to have two solid favourites: I See You Everywhere , by Julia Glass (Pantheon), and Ms. Hempel Chronicles , by Sarah Shun-lien Bynum (Harcourt). And I'll throw in The Great Man , by Kate Christensen (Anchor), one of my favourite books of the last 10 years, but I was late to this 2007 title, which I chanced on in a used bookstore in New Orleans. Ask me for my favourites a year from now and there will inevitably be an "older" book among them.
All three of these books belong to a very specific sub-subgenre of literary fiction of my own devising, which I define as the why-can't-we-have-more-books-like-these subgenre. Smart, well-constructed, elegantly written and capable of genuine, organic surprises. As I said, I ask for too little, I ask for too much, but I cling to my standards because sometimes I find exactly what I want.

COLIN & JUSTIN
It's summer, 2008, and we're at Toronto's Sony Centre to see Leonard Cohen, and we're doubly excited because Joni Mitchell is sitting two rows behind. Precisely à l'heure , the curtain sweeps back and out walks our favourite musician, suited somberly in dark grey and wearing a pork pie hat. His set proves to be a veritable religious experience and the entire theatre hangs on his every lyric. As his melancholic voice lifts and falls, a glassy-eyed audience of worshippers is lost in his musicality. There's a standing ovation after every song and when he recites a poem called A Thousand Kisses Deep , the hall falls silent. This man is spiritual beyond belief. Amen.
After the show we call our friend Cherri Campbell, and almost weep as we tell her how awesome the evening has been. The next day, she sends us a copy of Cohen's Book of Longing (McClelland & Stewart), and as we leaf the pages we're suddenly back in the Sony Centre. You see, as far as we're concerned, a good book should take you somewhere. It should puzzle, excite or inspire. Or it should simply remind you of something wonderful. Reading Book of Longing , as we've done time and time again, is an emotive reminder of that wonderful evening in Cohen's company.
Perfume: The Story of a Murderer , by Patrick Suskind (Vintage) is one of those books to which you just can't help returning. Dark, disturbing and incredibly well written, it's a gaudy tale of horror, yet it avoids obvious "slasher" shock tactics in favour of a deep, developing terror from one man's obsession to explore the sense that is his very raison d'être, the sense of smell. This book, while simultaneously grotesque and picturesque, is a literary masterpiece and we absolutely love it - if, that is, "love" is a suitable word to describe such a dark tale.
We're both inspired by pop culture and product packaging and Pet Shop Boys: Catalogue by Chris Heath (Thames & Hudson) is a beautiful tome about brand identity, product design and graphics. And it's a jolly good reminder of a really great pop band. Annie Leibovitz at Work (Random House) not only showcases much of the celebrated photographer's best work, it also offers a chance to look behind the lens at a woman who is every bit as fascinating as the subjects whom she so beautifully captures.

THEODORE DALRYMPLE
The Trial of Frederick Bywaters and Edith Thomson , edited by Filson Young (William Hodge & Co), is a 1923 entry in the Notable British Trial series, which ran from 1905 to 1959 in a completely unchanged format, and was one of the greatest publishing ventures of the past century. There are few greater pleasures than snuggling up to a fire while reading the transcript of the trial of the rococo criminals that Britain used to produce. This trial, a great cause celèbre , filmed and the subject of many novels, is among the best. Mrs. Thompson was hanged because she had written letters to her lover asking for advice on how to poison her husband with ground glass and suchlike. Bywaters eventually stabbed her husband to death and was hanged too.

Donald R. Keough is the former president of the Coca-Cola Company. He's been a personal friend for over 30 years and his The Ten Commandments for Business Failure (Portfolio) is a classic.
The foreword was written by Warren Buffett. Bill Gates, on the front of the jacket, says "Don's commandments for failure will teach you more about business success than a whole shelf full of books." Jack Welch says, "A must read for every leader."
It is, perhaps, the best business book that I have ever read. I highly recommend it to readers of all ages.
Keough says that if you quit taking risks, you will be sure to fail. If you are inflexible, you will be sure to fail.
If you assume infallibility, you will be sure to fail. If you don't take the time to think, you will be sure to fail.
If you put all your faith in experts and outside consultants, you will be sure to fail etc., etc.

MONIA MAZIGH
Earlier this year, I read the The Yacoubian Building (Harper Perennial) by Alaa Al Aswany, an Egyptian author. I couldn't stop comparing him to a modern-day Arabic Emile Zola.
I am fascinated by his description of the daily contradictions in Arabic life, and the tendency of the Arab world to withdraw into itself, sometimes consciously, but for the most part completely unaware. His descriptions also carry contradictions, seemingly both subtle and detailed, bringing me back to my own childhood and youth in Tunisia, another Arab country, different in so many ways, yet so compellingly similar.
Al Aswany uses "the building" as an allegory or microcosm of Egyptian society, where the liberal, formerly wealthy, aristocratic, educated class co-exists with the conservative, popular and poorer classes.
In the world he creates, the zealous, young, inexperienced, and economically disadvantaged meet the rich, the debauched and the moderate, while the atheist lives under the same roof as the corrupt man who has turned into a religious politician.
Al Aswany depicts this amalgam of characters with humour, but also with the eyes of a connoisseur and the skills of a social surgeon.
The Egypt he describes is a modern and frank Egypt, without the sugar coating of its once famous soap opera TV series, the utopian complexities of its theorists or the Puritanism common in Eastern culture.

RANDY BACHMAN
I read a lot of "airplane" adventure soft-cover books, which are quite similar. But once in a while I read something significant. The Ghost Map , by Steven Johnson (Riverhead), tells the story of London's great cholera epidemic in 1854, of the lack of sanitation and the living conditions, and of the detective work in sourcing the cause to one well that polluted the city and killed hundreds of thousands. A true look into the conditions and perceptions of health and sanitation in that time period, which is also reflective of the whole world. I found this book riveting as I know London very well; it was like reading about my own neighbourhood.

CRAIG BOYKO
I doubt that writing books is much like giving birth. Nor are books themselves much like children or babies - except perhaps in one respect.
Sometimes, when passing by someone else's pram, we cannot help but stare down in delight and sigh dreamily, "Oh, what a DEAR; I wish he were MINE!"
Trenchant, hilarious, brilliant, with not a single word out of place, Nigel Dennis's 1949 A Sea Change (Houghton Mifflin) is the best book I have read all year. I wish I had written it.

MELISSA FAYE GREENE
Darwin's On the Origin of Species will celebrate its 150th anniversary next November and the public sphere will fill with accolades and retrospectives. David Quammen's The Reluctant Mr. Darwin: An Intimate Portrait of Charles Darwin and the Making of His Theory of Evolution (Norton), accompanied by his coffeetable edition of On the Origin of Species (Sterling), ought to be at the top of everyone's list. Readers curious about the original theory can approach the bushy-browed, fierce-bearded, self-deprecating, garden-pottering old hermit himself.
He accidentally spent eight years hunched over tweezers and microscopes in the minuscule, sexually ambiguous world of barnacles; he tried to conceal from his dear Christian wife the fact that he beheld a materialistic law-driven world of vast splendour; and he was nearly trumped by a younger man in publishing his revolutionary insights. Shy, fumbling, hoping to please his tyrannical father, heartsick at the deaths of three of his 10 children, interminably suffering from digestive complaints, shunning the spotlight while coveting it, Quammen's Darwin is knowable, sympathetic and clearly, clearly, one of the few true giants of human history.

DAVID THOMSON
I have three choices.
Literary Nevada , edited by Cheryll Glotfelty (University of Nevada Press). Forgive and forget that a few of these 831 pages are by me, this is an invaluable introduction to the writings on the state and condition known as Nevada, the place where America has experimented on everything from biblical wilderness to gambling and from toxic nuclear waste to the fastest growing city in the U.S. The range of writing goes from Mark Twain and John Muir to Hunter Thompson and Samny Davis Jr. Nearly every entry brings a surprise and a sense of emptiness and moral chaos. We are all Nevadans now.
Ever, Dirk: The Letters of Dirk Bogarde , edited by John Coldstream (Weidenfeld & Nicolson). Bored with acting and sometimes seeming weary of life, Dirk Bogarde made himself a writer. He managed prim, tidy memoirs and novels. But in his letters he became himself - wicked, gossipy, swish, observant, cruel and tender. A lot of the letters come from his homes overseas, full of petty worries and rotten spelling. But the sense of jittery life is as rich and sly as his best acting. A delightful surprise and compulsive reading.
Me Cheeta (Fourth Estate). Without the apparent or acknowledged help of any human hand, here is the life story of the 76-year-old Cheeta - the long-suffering and story-telling chimpanzee who was part of Tarzan's family in the good old days of Hollywood. The format is a treasury of opportunities for scandal and the writing is consistently funny. Did Cheeta really write it himself? Well, he's a semi-retired abstract painter in Palm Springs now, but the taste for monkey business never goes away.

Anthony De Sa's Barnacle Love (Doubleday Canada) spans the old fish markets of Portugal to the young streets of Toronto in a collection of tenderly written short stories that, in total, tells of a painful, disillusioned immigrant experience. But De Sa also does us a historical favour by beautifully capturing the days when Portuguese fishermen invaded the nooks and crannies and churches of St. John's - leaving young schoolboys like me pondering over their legacy of rusted park signs saying "Keep Off the Grass" in Portuguese.

For me, it's William Wilberforce , by William Hague (HarperCollins). Wilberforce was a rare bird: He grew up wealthy, the scion of a merchant family in Hull. After meeting William Pitt the Younger at Cambridge, the two proceeded into the House of Commons together at the age of 23. Wilberforce's moral integrity and purity of spirit in the destruction of the greatest evil he saw mankind perpetrating - slavery - makes for a deeply moving and human account of one life well-lived for a single purpose.

MICHAEL ADAMS
John Ralston Saul's A Fair Country (Viking Canada) is an intellectually engaging effort to reframe our view of the relationship between aboriginal peoples and Canadians who have arrived (or been born to migrants) over the past four centuries. Saul's reading of history suggests that a more respectful, even egalitarian relationship existed between aboriginal peoples and European newcomers during the first couple of centuries before the period of de facto cultural genocide from which we are now only haltingly emerging.
Being a pollster, I naturally surveyed the opinions of my First Nations, Metis and Inuit friends and colleagues, and found unanimity among them that this book intrigued them, and did not, as I had feared, give unintentional offence with its provocative declaration that "We are a Metis civilization."
Aboriginal peoples are one of Canada's most rapidly growing demographic groups. Now at 1.2 million, they are close to the numbers estimated to have been here when Jacques Cartier first set foot on this land. An even larger number of us (1.8 million) claim aboriginal ancestry and both these numbers have been growing in recent censuses more rapidly than new births, suggesting that we are in fact witnessing a renaissance of aboriginal identity in this country - an emerging spirit that Saul is sensing. His book's quickly achieving bestseller status also suggests he is tapping into an inchoate sense among non-aboriginal Canadians that we should be rethinking the stereotypes we learned in the history books of our youth and that are reinforced every few months by the relentless bad-news stories in the media. Maybe - maybe - Saul has begun the dialogue that will create a powerful new national narrative (the Greeks called it mythos) to reframe this relationship from one of ignorance and racism to that of equality and respect.

HAL WAKE
It was impossible for me to choose a single book out of the many fine ones I have read this year, so I've decided to write about two pages of wondrous, luminous prose by a master of the craft.
I've read them more than a hundred times over the last decade and return to them several times a year. They are pages 16 and 17 in my paperback edition of Marilynne Robinson's magnificent novel Housekeeping (HarperCollins).
The passage begins, "One day my grandmother must have carried out a basket of sheets to hang in the spring sunlight, wearing her widow's black, performing the rituals of the ordinary as an act of faith."
What follows is depiction of the grandmother's relationship with her departed husband, Edmund. In two long paragraphs, Robinson engages in a profound meditation on the meaning of life and love and death and rebirth, in a prose voice that is by turns poetic, incantatory, allusive and almost biblical. Robinson does more in two pages than many novelists accomplish in entire books.

Jhumpa Lahiri's second collection of short stories, Unaccustomed Earth (Knopf Canada), was the book that moved me the most in 2008. Each story put me in awe of her powers as a writer and reminded me of that the short form often contains the biggest stories. The well-educated Bengali-Americans who populate her pages are so specific a group that it's astonishing to realize that they transcend that specificity to offer us insights into what it means to grow and survive as human beings in the 21st century. Writers can put this one on the aspirational section of the bookshelf.

Stephen Galloway's The Cellist of Sarajevo (Knopf Canada) turns the camera lens slightly away from the centrepiece of a legendary news story and drills down into the intimate lives of people struggling to survive in a divided, besieged city. Desperation, danger, compassion and beauty all mingle to create one of the most compelling reads of 2008. I was really surprised not to see it on every fiction award shortlist. This is that rare kind of book that transcends its subject matter and will outlast the fashions of our day.
The Letters of Ted Hughes (Farrar, Straus & Giroux) is a well-curated volume of correspondence that gave me something new from a poet I know intimately: a sense of his doubt. From Hughes's earliest fumblings toward poetic success, to his troubled marriages and the horror and self-loathing he experienced around the deaths of his wives, to the raising of his children, and finally his crowning as the grand man of English letters - the book creates a narrative that acts as a wonderful counterpoint to available biographies. The entire read is worth it for the description of his meeting with the Queen. It's the first book of letters I've ever read that I couldn't put down.

RAWI HAGE
Jacques Poulin's minimalist and philosophical novel Spring Tide (Archipelago Books) is a delicate and heart-wrenching contemplation on the necessity of solitude, the consequences of words and the tides of time. Poulin's prose is as simple, calm, deep and recurring as the waves that carry the protagonist's lover. In its wonderment and profound simplicity we are reminded of Le Petit Prince 's little planets and celestial encounters with machines, animals and faraway humans. Sheila Fischman's translation is magnificent, skillful and considered as always. Quebec's literature at its finest.
Rawi Hage's most recent novel is Cockroach. His De Niro's Game won the 2008 International IMPAC Dublin literary award.
MAG RUFFMAN
It's only fair to state my bias. I hate books without a happy ending. So I usually only read self-help and business books, hoping that I'll be the happy ending. This year I found one fiction book I loved. Ian Thomas's The Lost Chord (Manor House) is a metaphysical nail-biter that I started on a Saturday afternoon and didn't put down until midnight Sunday. It shows a breadth of imagination and a curly-minded originality that kept me engaged emotionally and intellectually without food or drink for about 20 hours. Thomas is renowned as a musician and for being the brother of an even more famous guy (comic Dave Thomas), but his novel is so unusual and thought-provoking that I think he deserves huge attention from readers with a taste for unconventional thinking.
My favourite self-help book this year is a mind-bender of indescribable scope and magnanimity. Money and the Law of Attraction , by Esther and Jerry Hicks (Hay House), is about how your thoughts affect your prosperity. It had a happy ending; my company doubled its revenue in 2008.

Resolutely refusing to choose between the wonderful books of my Canadian friends, I offer you Michael Chabon's The Yiddish Policemen's Union (HarperCollins), a noir detective story set in a Jewish homeland created in Sitka, Alaska in 1948 - but the lease is up. I read it while moving from the place I'd lived longest in my life, lying on the floor in the almost-empty house: perfect circumstances for this beautiful, broken-hearted book about displacement and yearning, some kind of salvation, and chess.

IRSHAD MANJI
Any new book that grabs my overworked students gets my vote as a 2008 favourite. This year, we have a tie.
American philosopher Susan Neiman compels critical thinking on the Left - where most of my class sits - with Moral Clarity: A Guide for Grown-Up Idealists (Harcourt). A happy Democrat who refuses to become a brainless Obamabot, she offers insights into savvy and ethical activism. Among the lessons that rocked my class: Today's liberals make a dangerous mistake in downplaying the threat of Islamism out of hatred for George W. Bush, since the first people to suffer under Islamist regimes are women and minorities - the very constituencies liberalism is supposed to serve. Sounds obvious, but to a generation steeped in polarized politics, it's a freaking revelation.
As is Arthur Herman's Gandhi and Churchill: The Epic Rivalry That Destroyed an Empire and Forged Our Age (Bantam). Eviscerating empire? Great start. Beyond the title, though, lies Herman's bigger score. He manages to make the iconic Gandhi utterly, sputteringly human - a dreamer who ran a contest in the local newspaper to name his fledging movement; a leader who repeatedly failed to ignite the movement for which he's now famous; a populist who couldn't have been less popular among his own for many years; a barrister who began donning his hallmark rags for the sake of image. Far from being disillusioned, my students could finally relate to the untouchable Mahatma, in whose false starts they see their own hopes for changing the world.
And one day, because of writers such as Neiman and Herman, these global citizens will transcend the limits of identity to realize they can also learn from a white guy like Churchill. Idealism, indeed.

IAN KERSHAW
Two books that I have particularly enjoyed and admired recently deal with important aspects of the Second World War, and lie close to my own interests.
Laurence Rees's World War Two Behind Closed Doors: Stalin, the Nazis and the West (BBC Books), is arguably the author's finest book to date and accompanies the gripping television series of the same title. Rees has uncovered new material in Soviet archives, casting fresh light on Stalin's relations with Churchill and Roosevelt and how decisions were taken at the pinnacle of Allied war leadership.
There are some unpleasant surprises for admirers of the Western leaders whose cynical, dirty dealings with Stalin are exposed.
But what choice did they have? An enemy's enemy was a friend. As Churchill himself put it: "If Hitler invaded Hell, I would at least make a favourable reference to the Devil" - almost a metaphor for the Soviet Union and its leader. Rees writes in fine style and interweaves into the often dramatic narrative the personal stories, drawn from numerous interviews with contemporaries who paid the price of those decisions and have moving, frequently horrific, experiences to recount. As unholy moral compromises of the western leaders with Stalin's inhumanity are laid bare, the important question which the book raises - and leaves open - is whether even the most just war can ever be fought with clean hands.
Previously unknown sources also enable Andrew Roberts, in his brilliantly written and fascinating Masters and Commanders. How Roosevelt, Churchill, Marshall and Alanbrooke Won the War in the West (Penguin), to make an important new contribution to the history of strategy in the Second World War - a remarkable achievement since, as he tells us, the topic brings up 1.64 million hits on Google. A chance find in the Churchill Archives Centre in Cambridge led him to the contemporary handwritten notes of a minor official in the cabinet office, Lawrence Burgis, who illegally retained the detailed record he kept of cabinet meetings - accounts far more informative than the bland official minutes. Many other collections of private papers have also been trawled to produce this vivid and impressive story of the relations - often laden with conflict though of momentous consequence in the strategic decisions that eventually emerged - of four individuals who were crucial to the waging of the war in the West.
This splendid book centres on the question of how personality affects historical change. The answer is plain: when all account is taken of structural determinants in history, key individuals played roles that were unique and indispensable.

DES McANUFF
Of my readings this year I was most tempted to recommend Michael Ondaatje's Divisadero (McClelland & Stewart), his exquisitely innovative novel rivalled only by Colm Tóibín's The Master (McClelland & Stewart), a breathtaking portrait of Henry James that could have been written by the man himself. That is my sneaky way of recommending three books instead of one.
But I finally settled on Bill Bryson's brief but superb Shakespeare: The World as Stage (HarperCollins), a kind of anti-biography of the Bard. Bryson's book follows the publication of Stephen Greenblatt's Will in World , Peter Ackroyd's Shakespeare: The Biography , James Shapiro's A Year in the Life of William Shakespeare: 1599 and a slew of other books on Shakespeare published in the last few years.
Bryson's book is suitably short as he takes on the challenge of writing about how little in fact we know of Shakespeare. The few confirmed facts leave him remaining one of the great literary mysteries of history. But somehow Bryson makes this patchwork portrait absolutely satisfying by debunking all the self-interested theories that have gone into concocting the fictional figure of the great dramatic poet. Royalists, Baconists and various other theorists (who would have us believe that Shakespeare did not in fact write his own plays) all fall at Bryson's feet.
At the same time, one is left with a surprisingly clear impression of Shakespeare, in the same fashion that one can see the shape of the invisible man when he appears in a rainstorm in the old black and white film.
This is a great book - one that a reader is compelled to consume in a single sitting. I speak from experience.

JOSEPH BOYDEN
The jacket drawing of John Ralston Saul's A Fair Country (Viking Canada) is both simple and wonderfully complex. To anyone who recognizes the Anishnabek worldview of Turtle Island, the illustration is a perfect summation of Saul's thesis. Canada is, indeed, a Metis nation. Saul's carefully constructed and illuminating argument offers us a new way of viewing ourselves, an argument with roots that stretch back centuries before Confederation. Our ties to the aboriginal, Saul argues, are far stronger than our ties to the European.
Clearly, this makes some more than a touch uncomfortable, even angry, which will certainly lead to good debate. And isn't that the point of a great book? There's no denying Saul is one of our nation's most lucid, commanding and progressive thinkers.
It's the rare book that offers its readers epiphanies that are at once startling and obvious. These Aha! moments are to be cherished. A Fair Country will change the way we view ourselves as a nation.
Joseph Boyden's novel Through Black Spruce won the 2008 Scotibank Giller Prize.
JIAN GOMESHI
As a piscavore and an aspiring good-eater, Taras Grescoe turned my world around this year. His Bottomfeeder (HarperCollins) is a compelling and entertaining read. Gresoce travelled the globe for over three years in the search of an ethical seafood meal. His easiest and safest rule of thumb (er, fin) is to avoid the big predators - tuna, swordfish - in favour of those found at the bottom of the seafood chain: sardines and mackerel.
I cannot shake this book. I can no longer eat tuna because some types are almost extinct and others full of mercury. Most salmon is routinely fed with meal from ground-up carcasses. On the positive side, Grescoe says the fish in McDonald's Filet-o-Fish sandwiches is actually ethically-sound pollack. My mother used to tell me that McDonald's was nasty. Times change.

Full text:   Municipal property assessments issued this fall are "unrealistic" given the dramatic drop in the real-estate market, Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty admitted yesterday , but he made no move to spare homeowners across the province.
By contrast, British Columbia Premier Gordon Campbell last month announced a freeze of property assessments at 2007 levels to help people cope with the turbulence in property values, putting off new valuations until late next year.
At a year-end news conference yesterday, Mr. McGuinty instead called on municipal governments to recognize that the assessments are out of date as they prepare local property tax bills next year.
"You would hope that municipal councils would act reasonably and responsibly given the circumstances and recognize that that perhaps was an unrealistic assessment," he said.
His comments came as the market for resale homes in the Toronto area showed deeper weakness in figures released yesterday by the Toronto Real Estate Board. The average sale price in the Greater Toronto Area dropped to $360,652 in the first half of December, down from $404,707 in the same period last year. In Toronto, the number of transactions dropped to 619, a decline of 56 per cent from the same period last year.
The Premier's remarks drew fire from opposition spokesmen and taxpayer groups, while Toronto officials expressed puzzlement.
"The comments of the Premier were ridiculous and show how far out of touch he is with the experience of Ontario families in an era of declining home values," said Conservative finance critic Tim Hudak, noting the Jan. 1 assessment was based on values a year ago when prices were high.
He and others said the onus now is on the province to direct its property-assessment agency to scrap the 2008 assessment, the first in several years, and start fresh in 2009.
"There's nothing municipalities can do; if it's unrealistic, it's unrealistic," said Bob Topp of the Coalition After Property Tax Reform. "Some people are going to have huge increases way out of line with what their properties are now worth."
Opposition parties charged that the Liberal government created the problem by freezing assessments for several years prior to the 2007 Ontario election - to avoid a backlash from homeowners - and then scrapping annual assessments in favour of a four-year cycle.
"Now people are hit with what, in effect, was a three-year combination all at once that doesn't reflect current economic circumstances," New Democratic Party Leader Howard Hampton said.
In Toronto, budget chief Shelley Carroll said the city "can only act on what is," namely current data from the Municipal Property Assessment Corporation.
She added the Premier's comments "don't indicate what he intends to do about [a possible change in assessment], and only he can do something about it."
Meanwhile, she said, the city still plans a "nice, modest" property tax of between 2 and 4 per cent next year.
Mr. McGuinty dismissed suggestions about capping rates, saying his government introduced a four-year phase-in to ease the impact of assessments on homeowners.

Full text: Wartime box-office star was the bobby soxer's heartthrob
He found stardom playing soldiers and sailors in wartime movies and then returned to Broadway 50 years after starting out there as a hoofer in a chorus line. Van Johnson's boy-next-door wholesomeness made him a popular box-office attraction in such films as 30 Seconds over Tokyo , A Guy Named Joe and The Caine Mutiny.
With his tall build, handsome, freckled face, red hair and sunny personality, he starred opposite Esther Williams, June Allyson and Elizabeth Taylor and others during 20 years under contract to MGM.
During the height of his popularity, Mr. Johnson was cast most often as the all-American boy. He played a flier who lost a leg in a crash after the bombing of Japan in 30 Seconds Over Tokyo . He was a writer in love with a wealthy American girl (Ms. Taylor) in The Last Time I Saw Paris . He appeared as a post-Civil War farmer in The Romance of Rosy Ridge .
The son of a real-estate agent, he grew up in seaside Newport. From his earliest years he was fascinated by the touring companies that played in local theatres, and after high school he announced his intention to try his luck in New York. He arrived on Broadway in 1934 with $5 and a straw suitcase.
At first he landed him nothing but chorus jobs and went to Hollywood for a bit part in the 1940 movie Too Many Girls . He was signed to a Warner Bros. contract but got dropped after making Murder in the Big House . He was about to return to New York when Lucile Ball, whom he knew on Too Many Girls , invited him to dinner.
"Lucille tried to cheer me up, but I just couldn't seem to laugh," he oce said. "Suddenly she said to me, 'There's Billy Grady over there; he's MGM's casting director. I'm going to introduce you, and at least you're going to act like you're the star I think you will be.' "
The result was a contract with MGM and a small part in The War Against Mrs. Hadley. He next appeared with Lionel Barrymore as Dr. Gillespie's New Assistant , (1942), and as Mickey Rooney's friend in The Human Comedy.
His break came with Irene Dunne and Spencer Tracy in the wartime fantasy A Guy Named Joe . It was, however, almost wiped out by tragedy.
On April 1, 1943, his DeSoto convertible was struck head-on by another car. "They tell me I was almost decapitated, but I never lost consciousness," he once recalled. "I spent four months in the hospital after they sewed the top of my head back on."
Filming was postponed for his recovery, after which MGM cashed in on his new stardom with with such titles as The White Cliffs of Dover, Two Girls and a Sailor, Weekend at the Waldorf, High Barbaree and Three Guys Named Mike .
Regarded as a heartthrob by bobby soxers - he was called "the non-singing Sinatra" - Mr. Johnson married only once. In 1947 at the height of his career, he eloped to Juarez, Mexico, to marry Eve Wynn, who had just divorced his good friend Keenan Wynn four hours before.
The marriage produced a daughter, and ended bitterly 13 years later. "She wiped me out in the ugliest divorce in Hollywood history," Mr. Johnson told reporters.
By all accounts, his wife had begun to question his gender. "I was in love with Van, but I wouldn't have married him if I'd known he was a homosexual," she told writer Scott Eyman in Lion of Hollywood , a study of studio boss Louis B. Mayer.
Mr. Johnson's vogue faded by the mid-1950s, and film roles became sparse, although he did have a comeback with Janet Leigh in 1963, Wives and Lovers .
Around that time, he returned to the stage to play Damn Yankees in summer theatres at $7,500 a week, followed by a two-year contract to star in The Music Man in London. He took the job, he said, "because the phone didn't ring. Because the film scripts were getting crummier and crummier."
For the next 30 years, he was one of the busiest stars in regional and dinner theatres, and then in 1985 he returned to Broadway in La Cage aux Folles , the hit musical.
VAN JOHNSON
Van Johnson was born Charles Van Dell Johnson in Newport, R.I., on Aug. 25, 1916. He died Dec. 12, 2008., at an assistant-living centre in Nyack, N.Y. He was 92. He leaves his daughter, Schuyler.

Economic storm erodes Monaco's building dreams

Abstract: The recession rolling across Europe threatens to damage more than Monaco's development plans. The country's main annual magnet for the rich, famous and beautiful, the Monaco Grand Prix, the Formula 1 race that has run since 1929, could become a shadow of its former self as racing teams cut back. Honda just pulled out of F1 and the industry is rife with rumours that Renault of France is next.

Full text: Financial backing dries up for plan to expand cramped haven of the superrich onto a huge platform in the Mediterranean
Monaco's 5-per-cent solution has been diluted to nothing by the financial crisis.
The tiny, and exceedingly crowded, principality formally revealed this week that the plan to thrust the country into the sea - adding 5 per cent to its size - has been abandoned. The announcement came a day after Monaco's Prince Albert II told the news agency AFP that "In the current climate, it would be irresponsible to launch a project of this scale."
Few residents seemed surprised, or particularly upset, that the project had been cancelled. "With the financial meltdown, the Middle East consortiums that were behind this project were obviously suffering," said David Mongeau, the former CIBC mergers and acquisitions chief who is now chairman of Avington Financial. "And Monaco is a perpetual construction site. The last thing we needed was another few years of dust and dirt."
With 33,000 residents jammed into slightly less than two square kilometres, Monaco has the highest population density of any sovereign state in the world. To create elbow room, the country has had two choices: build vertically or extend its territory into the Mediterranean. In the late 1970s, it added 20 hectares - equivalent to 16 per cent of its surface area - through a sea extension called Fontvieille, now home to the AS Monaco Football Club and the International University of Monaco.
It wasn't enough. The world's rich, seeking tax-free status, kept arriving by the yacht-load and Monaco devised a second sea extension. At the end of 2006, it announced a short list of candidates to compete for the "coastal urbanization project," with an estimated cost of as much as EUR10-billion, or $16.5-billion.
The two architects who had made the competition's short list were Britain's Sir Norman Foster, who redesigned the Reichstag in Berlin, and the American Daniel Libeskind, who designed the crystal at the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto. No fewer than five development and construction consortiums were in the running, including Qatar's Barwa Real Estate, whose partners included Canadian engineering firm SNC-Lavalin.
Albert's environmental concerns ensured that the project, covering 275,000 square metres, would be an epic engineering feat. The Prince, who was the opening speaker at last week's UN Environmental Program conference on migratory species in Rome, did not want to fill the water with rubble to make the peninsula.
The idea instead was to make a one-kilometre raised platform, resting on pontoons and blocks up to 50 metres deep.
The project's cancellation was partly due to environmental worries. "I would in any case want to ensure myself that the effects on the environment would be as limited as possible," he told AFP.
The recession rolling across Europe threatens to damage more than Monaco's development plans. The country's main annual magnet for the rich, famous and beautiful, the Monaco Grand Prix, the Formula 1 race that has run since 1929, could become a shadow of its former self as racing teams cut back. Honda just pulled out of F1 and the industry is rife with rumours that Renault of France is next. If several teams pull out, the Monaco race, the F1 circuit's most glamorous event, will lose much of its appeal.
Another problem is the yachting crowd. Monaco has always been the Mediterranean's top harbour for the superrich and their superyachts. Recently, the yachting market has been propelled by Russian millionaires and billionaires. They are shedding wealth quickly and the harbour could look at lot less cluttered next summer.
The good news for the locals is that fewer millionaires milling around might translate into lower prices for everything from champagne to condos.
"Its hugely expensive living here," Mr. Mongeau said.

Abstract: I think it's the best possible insulation on the market - no question. Spray foam is effective over all at creating that complete thermal break in the building envelope. It covers everything, so there's no possibility of cold spots, voids or settling. There is no air movement between outside and inside, so there's no possibility of condensation and, since it's inorganic it won't allow for mould growth.

Full text: With so much to choose from, materials have to be judged on their merits
I talk a lot about insulation - that's because it's important. Good insulation is absolutely key to reduced energy costs and better indoor air quality.
I recently had an e-mail from Becky asking about what insulation to use when building a new home. She'd prefer to not use fibreglass, and instead use the most natural, "healthiest" material.
What do we mean by "healthy"? Are we talking "healthy" from an indoor air point of view? Or healthy for the earth - as in green production and installation? All types of insulation - if you consider they cut down on energy use - are "green," but some are better than others.
For an insulation to be "good," it needs to give you energy savings. It needs to be inorganic so it won't allow for mould growth. It can't absorb moisture or it'll compress and lose its ability to insulate. And it shouldn't harm your indoor air quality with minute particles that circulate through the heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems.
Insulation is measured in "R-value" - that is the material's resistance to heat loss. The higher the number, the better the material insulates. The building code specifies the minimum R-value for attics and walls. But R-value alone won't tell you what is the best insulation. Heat loss is just one factor to consider.
The real concern is air movement. You might have R-40 insulation in your attic, but if you have air leakage because of a poor vapour barrier, you will have problems - problems with heat loss and with condensation.
BATT INSULATION
This comes in blanket-like pieces that are placed between the studs of your walls. Most often it's made from fibreglass or mineral wool.
I've also used blue jean insulation. It's made from recycled denim jeans that have been treated with Borax. It's "green and clean," but really hard to find since there aren't many manufacturers of it around.
Batt insulation must not be compressed, since the trapped air in the fibreglass or mineral wool adds to the insulation value. Crush it or squeeze it into a cavity and you lose R-value.
I don't know how "healthy" fibreglass or mineral wool is. I don't think I'd like to breathe it, based on how itchy it is when it gets on your skin or into your eyes. Particles of batt insulation can negatively impact your indoor air quality.
LOOSE FILL
This comes in fibreglass and mineral wool, as well as cellulose. Loose fill or blown insulation needs to be applied by a professional. The installer has to do it right - blowing it evenly and to the right depth. I don't know how often I've seen loose fill insulation that's been blown randomly into an attic space, covering all the soffit vents and cutting off the ventilation in the attic. This is a huge problem, and it can lead to ice dams and the deterioration of your roof.
RIGID INSULATION
I use rigid all the time in basements. It's a great product for that use. The polystyrene foam board is strong and provides the thermal break you need on basement floors and walls to eliminate the condensation that leads to mould.
Rigid insulation is non-organic, doesn't hold moisture and isn't a food source for mould.
SPRAY FOAM
I'm a huge fan of closed-cell spray foam insulation. It wins on all counts - energy efficiency, indoor air quality and environmentally. It's also its own vapour barrier (though you should check with local municipalities. Some inspectors still want to insist on a vapour barrier, though they shouldn't.)
There are two main kinds of spray foam - polyicynene and polyurethane. Both must be applied by a specialized installer. Some CFCs (chlorofluorocarbons) are used in production and they off-gas for a time after application. All spray foam insulation is now being changed over to use eco-friendly propellants.
I think it's the best possible insulation on the market - no question. Spray foam is effective over all at creating that complete thermal break in the building envelope. It covers everything, so there's no possibility of cold spots, voids or settling. There is no air movement between outside and inside, so there's no possibility of condensation and, since it's inorganic it won't allow for mould growth.
Walltite ECO is newest development in spray foam. You've seen me using the blue spray foam (it's now purple, and it's better). The formulation includes recycled plastic, renewable content, and the blowing agent is zero-ozone depleting.
Walltite Eco is the first closed-cell spray foam insulation to have EcoLogo certification - the most widely recognized third-party audit and environmental certification. So, for my money, it's the most healthy, effective and environmentally friendly insulation out there.

Full text: To judge from 19th-century texts such as A Christmas Carol , the Victorians did a bit of shopping on Christmas Eve and then took a single day off to celebrate a holiday they marked with one special meal and a few small gifts. At our house, the four-year-old pasted a lengthy wish list to the fridge weeks ago and the tree went up last weekend. The local supermarket has had its decorations up since November and, with two whole weeks to go until Christmas, the television schedule is awash with holiday programming. You can navigate your way around the carol concerts and Christmas movies yourself, but I will draw your attention to A Christmas Carol (VisionTV, 9 p.m.) because it is a rather clever update of the classic that easily moves the morality tale to an impoverished housing estate in contemporary London.
Eddie Scrooge (Ross Kemp of EastEnders ) is the local loan shark who is spending Christmas Eve rebuffing a pair of begging street kids, repossessing a single mum's TV set, collecting his weekly payment from a couple of arthritic pensioners who can't save enough to buy a stair lift and declining his nephew's dinner invitation as he dismisses Christmas as the day "the stupid and the bone idle join forces to celebrate the birth of catalogue shopping." He does at least agree to give his bookkeeper Cratchit the afternoon off so he can spend it in hospital with a son who has cystic fibrosis.
Scrooge is soon visited by the ghost of his business partner, Jacob Marley (Ray Fearon of Coronation Street ), who was recently gunned down in a stairwell, and warned to expect more visitors. The Ghost of Christmas Past - Scrooge's old dad pops up on the TV screen - takes him back first to his sorry childhood and then to the day exactly a year before when his girlfriend, a nurse in the local emergency room, dumped him because she could not stand his job. (The only new plot line here is a romantic one as the reformed Scrooge tries to win her back.) Marley reappears to show him Christmas Present in the shape of the small holiday joys experienced by the single mum and the pensioners on the one hand, and the perilous condition of the street kids on the other. And finally a mysterious, silent child appears to show Scrooge his own cold and lonely death.
The deftest part of this remake, written by Peter Bowker and directed by Catherine Morshead, is the way it twists the time-travel device à la Groundhog Day so that Scrooge keeps repeating the events of Christmas Eve over and over - from the repossessed TV set and a suddenly collapsing stack of Christmas trees to the rescue of the street kids - until he finally gets it right. The ending is, of course, moralistic and sentimental, entirely in keeping with the ghostly original.
For real chills, try considering instead the prospect of zoonotics, animal viruses that can infect humans and do so at growing rates because of population density, global travel and the increased hunting of bush meat due to rising food prices. Tonight, CNN is delivering this year's instalment of Planet in Peril: Battle Lines (CNN, 9 p.m.), concentrating this time on the tension between humans and wildlife, and the four-segment news documentary opens with its scariest tale. Anchor Anderson Cooper and medical correspondent Sanjay Gupta follow this really alarming story to Cameroon and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where, among other places, they visit a community that has been infected with the sometimes-fatal monkey pox, probably through contact with the animal's blood when it was being butchered.
The good news here comes in the form of Nathan Wolfe, a dedicated epidemiologist who is tracking such contact on the principle that if you can recognize viruses quickly, it may be possible to stop another HIV from spreading. Impressively, all the hunters CNN encounters in the bush are taking blood samples from their kills to pass on to his research project.
The program then follows broadcast journalist Lisa Ling from Costa Rica to Taiwan as she tracks the legal and illegal fishing of sharks solely so their fins can be used for soup in Chinese restaurants. (The still-living finless bodies are sometimes dumped back into the sea to sink to the bottom and die.) It looks like only a matter of time before a public relations campaign for the fish would make the ecologically disastrous delicacy verboten.
Can conservation tourism hasten that day? CNN also unearths one inspiring story of ecotourism, explaining how a recovering Rwanda is now making strenuous efforts to save its mountain gorillas, thanks in part to tourism dollars. On the other hand, the thrill of cage diving, in which tourists pay to see great white sharks up close from the security of a cage attached to the side of a boat, is controversial. Alarmed South African surfers allege the practice of chumming - attracting the sharks by trailing blood and bait in the water - is training them to equate humans with food. Interestingly, a researcher interviewed here says she finds no evidence that chumming is making the sharks more aggressive, and the story feels slim compared with the other three. You have to wonder if it made the cut mainly because Cooper, accompanied by a tour operator who regularly swims unprotected with the sharks, decides to go diving for his viewers without benefit of the cage.

Full text: This major shipping gateway has a $2.5-billion, long-term plan to handle a bigger share of international trade
The global economy might be slowing down and with it international trade, but so far it is having little effect on the Port of Montreal - one of the main North American gateways for goods transiting Eastern Canada and the U.S. Midwest.
Container traffic is particularly strong: Preliminary data compiled by the Washington-based American Association of Port Authorities show that for the first eight months of this year, container traffic through Montreal grew 10.1 per cent from a year earlier.
Not only is the port thriving, it is upgrading and expanding its facilities for anticipated growth, having launched a $2.5-billion infrastructure project - Vision 2020 - that will unfold over the next 12 years with a goal, among others, of tripling the port's container capacity to the equivalent of 4.5 million 20-foot container units.
"We're running out of space," says Patrice Pelletier, president and chief executive officer of the Montreal Port Authority (MPA). "The effects of the economic downturn could impact us in 2009, but these downturns are always cyclical and we want to be ready when the markets start coming back.
"We have to keep looking ahead," he adds. "This is a long-term project. Let's face it, people aren't going to stop eating or buying things that they need for the house."
The port, which is open year-round, sprawls along 25 kilometres of Montreal's waterfront. The downtown complex comprises four container terminals, 15 transit sheds for non-containerized general cargo (steel, forest products, food) and dry bulk (fertilizer, sugar, copper, road salt), storage space for 15 million barrels of liquid bulk (petroleum products) and a terminal capable of holding 260,000 tonnes of grain.
Vision 2020 is being implemented in four phases, of which the first is already under way. The first two will streamline and reorganize existing infrastructure - remodelling old buildings, utilizing empty parking lots, converting underutilized spaces into container terminals and so on.
Phases 3 and 4 will see the building of new terminals, either in Montreal East or at Contrecoeur, 40 kilometres down the St. Lawrence Seaway, to expand container capacity. The exact location and financing are yet to be worked out.
According to Mr. Pelletier, part of the $2.5-billion financing will come from the private sector, as well as the port's own reserves, with $450-million to $650-million expected to be provided by the federal government. He points out that infrastructure projects of this size are typically financed over many years and thus have little exposure to short-term fluctuations in the market.
"We're taking an attitude of prudent optimism," Mr. Pelletier says. "We know that we must build on the essential infrastructure because it's important for the future development of Canada, not just Montreal."
Once completed in 2020, the port's makeover is expected to create 41,000 jobs and generate $3.4-billion in revenue, officials say. That doesn't include construction: Phases 1, 2 and 3 alone are expected to generate $740-million in gross domestic product and 10,000 jobs, they say. The port's activities and related spinoffs already account for 18,200 jobs, either directly or indirectly across the country; in 2007, MPA's profit was $8.4-million on operating revenue of $81.7-million.
Contributing to the Port of Montreal's profit is revenue from the cruise industry. Part of the port complex includes Alexandra Pier, a cruise ship terminal, which, along with the rest of the port, is slated for redevelopment. The berths are close to downtown and cruise passengers can walk into the heart of Old Montreal with its many tourist attractions, but the MPA, taking its cue from other cruise destinations, want them to linger and spend money in the port area.
At present, there is little to induce anybody to hang around the terminal buildings, which are basically a couple of unprepossessing sheds. Future plans under Vision 2020, however, include constructing a modern recreational and tourism complex with boutiques, restaurants, entertainment venues and the like, to create an attractive destination both for out-of-towners and for local residents.
Determining the exact footprint of that area of the waterfront will be decided next year, according to Mr. Pelletier. The timing is good. Cruise traffic along the St. Lawrence River is growing. This year, 25 cruise ships carrying 32,100 passengers called at the port, and based on forward bookings, 2,000 more passengers are scheduled to arrive in 2009. The revamped Alexandra Pier is expected to attract many thousands more.
In the meantime, while the Port of Montreal is enjoying a bumper year, cargo shipments might slow in 2009. Fluctuations in the rates of exchange between the Canadian dollar and other currencies affect the levels of international trade. Moreover, there tends to be a delayed reaction to the ups and downs of an economy and the flow of goods.
"In our business, there's often a time lag between supply and demand," explains Serge Dubreuil, president of Logistec Stevedoring Inc., one of the largest cargo-handling companies at the Port of Montreal. "We've noticed a drop, for example, in the export of recycled paper. It was going to China to be turned into packaging but now that the demand for Chinese-made goods has weakened, the demand for the paper has gone down as well."
"That being said, we've picked up business from other regions of the world, such as South America, where some economies are still growing and, right now, our cargo terminals are at capacity.
"From our point of view, an expansion to the port is well overdue. We have to look ahead, well beyond what is happening right now."
*****
Fraught with freight
The Port of Montreal's success, in the face of economic malaise, in large part hinges on that old real estate adage - location, location, location.
It's healthy cargo traffic is a result of its geographical position and the speed with which it can process goods coming to and from the almost 90 countries with which it does business. Cargo shipped via Montreal from Germany, for example, takes just less than 10 days to reach Chicago, compared with almost 12 days via New York. Because Montreal is so far inland - 1,600 kilometres from the Atlantic coast - it has the edge over many of its Eastern Seaboard competitors.
An integrated transport and distribution system also contributes to the port's competitive edge. The Montreal Port Authority owns 100 kilometres of railway (including rolling stock) that connect to its berths and terminals and which, in turn, feed into the networks of the two major Canadian railways. Moreover, the port's customer base is fairly diversified.
It is not reliant on one major market such as the United States or China - two of the countries most affected by the current economic meltdown - and imports and exports are almost equally balanced, with 55 per cent of goods leaving Canada and 45 per cent coming in. Helga Loverseed

Abstract: One of Tribune's most pressing concerns: By the end of the year, the company is likely to be in violation of debt terms that limit borrowings to nine times its adjusted profits.

Full text: Tribune Co. is preparing for a possible filing for bankruptcy court protection as soon as this week, according to people familiar with the matter, in another sign of trouble for the newspaper industry.
In recent days, as Tribune continued talks with lenders to restructure its debt, the newspaper-and-television concern hired Lazard Ltd. as its financial adviser, as well as legal counsel for a possible trip through bankruptcy court, according to people familiar with the matter.
A Tribune spokesman said the firm doesn't comment on rumours or speculation. Tribune owns eight major daily newspapers, including the Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune and Baltimore Sun, and a string of local TV stations.
A spokesman for investment bank Lazard didn't respond to a request for comment.
Tribune's actions underscore the distress enveloping newspaper publishers. Their businesses are being battered by dwindling advertising sales, and they are carrying debt loads that are unmanageable under current market conditions. Insiders expect some papers will need to fold or seek protection from creditors to reorganize in coming months.
Tribune has been on wobbly footing since last December, when real-estate mogul Samuel Zell led a debt-backed deal to take it private. Tribune so far has stayed ahead of its $12-billion (U.S.) in borrowings with the help of asset sales. Now, however, dwindling profits are tightening the noose.
The company's cash flow may not be enough to cover nearly $1-billion in interest payments due this year, and Tribune owes a $512-million debt payment in June.
One of Tribune's most pressing concerns: By the end of the year, the company is likely to be in violation of debt terms that limit borrowings to nine times its adjusted profits. The ratio stood at 8.3 at the end of the second quarter, before Tribune reported an 83-per-cent decline in operating profit for the three months ended Sept 28.
Violations of such debt covenants have become commonplace for newspaper companies as profits have ebbed in recent months. Lenders so far have been willing to give the companies a pass in exchange for higher interest rates and other concessions, but Tribune has little wiggle room. Terms of the company's debt already are so loose and its financial standing so unsteady that a covenant waiver may not help.
To be sure, a restructuring outside of bankruptcy court remains an option for Tribune. Executives have indicated previously that the debt talks are amicable, and it remains possible the two sides can agree to rework the firm's borrowings on their own, as other newspaper publishers are doing.
Tribune's hiring of Lazard, meanwhile, brings it a firm experienced in debt restructuring, and one that has become a go-to adviser for newspaper firms in financial distress.
Even as its financial performance worsens, Tribune has some options. A sale of its Chicago Cubs baseball team is under way, and Tribune owns valuable stakes in businesses including the cable TV channel Food Network.
Tribune already has auctioned off pieces of the company, including the Long Island, N.Y., daily Newsday to raise cash. Now, however, frozen credit markets have depressed sale prices. Selling off more newspapers may not be a viable option because buyers are scarce and Tribune may be better off holding onto the profits from its papers.

FILM
BOND ON SET
Filming Quantum of Solace, by Greg Williams, DK, 160 pages, $40
James Bond never was a man of many words, and nor is this book. With a text limited to a foreword, captions and an interview of actor Craig Daniels by the author-photographer, the rest is a visual treat of hundreds of pictures.
HORROR CINEMA
Edited by Jonathan Penner and Steven Jay Schneider, Taschen, 192 pages, $32.99
From its familiar cover shot of a madly grinning Jack Nicholson in The Shining , shouting through a door he has just staved in with an ax, "Here's Johnny!," to its back-jacket image of another ax murderer, Joan Crawford, in Straitjacket , this is a history of horror films in the splendid visual style we have come to expect of this always interesting publisher. So, yes, here are the masters of the genre - Chaney, Karloff and Lugosi - but also those who only serve and entertain, the outrageous Herschell Gordon Lewis, the subversive Joe Dante. And of course, many arresting photos - and a few that may shock.
GRAPHICA
BAT-MANGA
The Secret History of Batman in Japan, by Chip Kidd, Geoff Spear and Saul Ferris, translated by Anne Ishii and Chip Kidd, Pantheon, unpaginated, $69
Superstar book designer Kidd's version of Batman, Japanese-style, is a magnificent production. It may not be for everyone, but those who like it will like it a lot. Reading from right to left, as is the manga wont, this is a colourful and sumptuous collection of the winged avenger's Nipponese life, his adventures rendered in sumptuous sepia, with colour images sprinkled throughout. Unlike anything else you'll have seen. Quite a marvel (apologies to DC Comics).
WATCHING THE WATCHMEN
By Dave Gibbons, Titan Books, unpaginated, $45
Dave Gibbons is the distinguished illustrator of what for many is the greatest graphic novel of all, Alan Moore's iconic Watchmen . This beautifully designed creation (by the ubiquitous Chip Kidd, with Mike Essl) allows fans to get up close and personal with the work as Gibbons offers access to his archives, preliminary sketches, discarded drawings, original character renderings and so much more. A must have for Watchmen watchers.
THE DC VAULT
By Martin Pasko, Running Press, 192 pages, $52.50
"A Museum-in-a-Book," trumpets the cover of this extensive tribute to one of the fonts of comic bookdom. And it's not far off. That this is a very enjoyable compendium of the universe inhabited by Superman and his kin is just part of the fun. The real treat is in the reproductions of collectibles from the title vault: an early Batman mask, a Captain Marvel sticker, a Wonder Woman button, a cover reproduced from a 1940 Double Action Comics. For the kid who lives in all of us.
MARVEL CHRONICLE
A Year by Year History
Foreword by Stan Lee. Afterword by Joe Quesada, DK Publishing, unpaginated, $55
Complete with its own box and a cover sliced into the shape of an M, this profusely illustrated tale covers the Marvel comic-book empire from its start in 1939, through such titles as Millie the Model and Ringo Kid , to the 2006 saga of a civil war involving the Marvel superheroes and the 2007 death of Captain America. But it's the 1960s crop of the Fantastic Four, Spider-Man, the Incredible Hulk and similarly famous creations of writer-editor Stan Lee and his illustrators that give the history its heft.
THE DC COMICS ENCYCLOPEDIA
The Definitive Guide to the Characters of the DC Universe
By Scott Beatty, Robert Greenberger, Phil Jimenez and Dan Wallace, DK, 399 pages, $44
If you're a comic-book aficionado, think of this alphabetically organized update of a 2004 collection as one-stop shopping for details of DC superheroes and villains through the ages, from the classic Superman and Batman to the newer Nightwing (Batman's Robin all grown up) and villains such as King Shark. If you're a neophyte, consider this a richly illustrated guide to the minds of talented fantasists and the universe they have created from scratch.
STRANGE AND STRANGER
The World of Steve Ditko
By Blake Bell, Fantagraphics, 216 pages, $47.95
Steve Ditko is best known as the original artist behind Spider-Man and the mystical Dr. Strange in the Marvel comic books of the 1960s. Less familiar is his increasing obsession with the Objectivist philosophy of author Ayn Rand ( The Fountainhead ), a preoccupation that diminished his later work and limited his commercial opportunities. Bell's impressive, balanced biography of the man and his work is accompanied by hundreds of illustrations from Ditko's career.
THE VERTIGO ENCYCLOPEDIA
By Alex Irving, DK, 240 pages, $33
Swamp Thing , The Sandman , John Constantine: Hellblazer : Sure, it's dark and demonic, but you can't help but admire the fertile imaginations at work in this lavishly illustrated compendium of the characters and scenarios depicted in more than 200 titles - both one-shot publications and series - under DC Comics' Vertigo banner. A logical recipient for this fascinating book would be the comic-book guy (or gal) in your life, but even casual observers of the phantasmagorical might appreciate an escape into "the Sandman's dark dream."
MUSIC
ALBUM COVER ALBUM
Edited by Storm Thorgerson and Roger Dean, Collins Design, 160 pages, $31.95
Hey, you with the iPod: Before MP3s, there were CDs. Before CDs, there were cassettes and eight-tracks. Before that, there were record albums. Artists got very creative with album covers, possibly because in those days we had time to look at them. You might recognize some of their efforts if you have time to pick up the latest edition of this engrossing book, first issued in 1977.
THE CLASH
Mick Jones, Paul Simonon, Topper Headon and the estate of Joe Strummer, Atlantic, 384 pages, $50
The Clash, unlike most punk rockers, who courted anarchy when they courted anything, embraced a coherent anti-authoritarian leftist ideology, beginning with their debut album, The Clash in London , in 1977. Their third album, London Calling , is an all-time classic. Although they were only together for a decade, they truly were an international phenom. This book recreates something of their energy and passion through interviews, posters, artwork and photos. The only thing missing is a soundtrack of their biggest hits.
THE BAND NAME BOOK
By Noel Hudson, 336 pages, Boston Mills Press, $29.95
What's not to like about Secret Trial Five, The Whole Bolivian Army, Incredible Steel Erectors, Mink Jaguar, Furious George, Penguins With Shotguns, Gay Dad, Abdominal Cavity, Coach Said Not To, Saltwater Vampires, Kevorkian Death Cycle and The Men They Couldn't Shave? Actually, you'll find there's plenty not to like about such bands, but it comes in easily digestible snippets, making this an irresistible addition to any pop-culture library.
ART
BLACK
The History of a Color, by Michel Pastoureau, translated by Jody Gladding, Princeton University Press, 210 pages, $43.95
French popular art historian Pastoureau here tackles one of the most complex and interesting colours, the favourite of "priests and penitents, artists and ascetics, fashion designers and fascists." This social history is lavishly illustrated with paintings, movie stills, photo portraits and fashion shoots.
BARCELONA 1900
Edited by Teresa-M. Sala, Cornell University Press, 216 pages, $64.95
In the period from 1880 to 1910, Barcelona was one of the most culturally and artistically fertile places in the world, with impressive contributions in music, painting, sculpture, literature and architecture, including the exotic and visionary buildings from Antoni Gaudi, and elegant interiors in the modernista style, Barcelona's version of art nouveau. The work features considerable text and nearly 200 illustrations, many in full colour, and including historical photographs.
THE ART OF MANTUA
Power and Patronage in the Renaissance, by Barbara Furlotti and Guido Rebecchini, translated by A. Lawrence Jenkens, Getty Publications, 278 pages, $94.95
Mantua, a small town on the Po River Valley, was the seat of power of the lordly Gonzaga family, who ruled it from the 14th to the 18th centuries, and whose vision - and money - turned it into one of the flourishing artistic centres of the Italian Renaissance. This meaty book covers the city's history and cultural legacy in considerable depth, and features as well dozens of paintings, maps, illustrations and photographs.
DUTCH SEVENTEENTH-CENTURY GENRE PAINTING
Its Stylistic and Thematic Evolution, by Wayne Franits, Yale University Press, 328 pages, $54
We've come to love the verisimilitude and everyday subject matter of 17th-century Dutch art as providing a window on the real world of the time. Now comes a study that shows how tradition, market pressure and political forces shaped its themes and styles, making it not so realistic after all. But never mind, you can enjoy the book and still hold to your belief that Vermeer's Milkmaid and his Lace-Maker once existed exactly as we see them in his art.
ART
The Definitive Visual Guide, Ian Chivers, chief consultant, DK, 612 pages, $55
DK (Dorling Kindersley) is known for lavish tourist guides and extensive and imaginative use of photos, maps and diagrams. It has applied that approach to art in this massive guide to more than 2,500 paintings and sculptures from prehistory to the 21st century. The editors discuss art movements, provide thumbnail artist profiles and trace themes such as the nude from the Greeks through Henry Moore. Comprehensive and yet detailed, the book is both an overview and a close-up of individual works - and the reproduction quality is very high.
LOUVRE
400 Masterpieces, by Daniel Soulié, Abrams, 544 pages, $44
The Louvre, the most famous museum in the world, contains 400,000 works of art and archeological artifacts - which explains why might explain the difficulty in finding Mona Lisa on a first visit. But now, if you're careful (the book Louvre weighs two kilograms), you can discover the world's most famous image on page 301, under Italian paintings. Although the selection of objects is "arbitrary," the illustrations, as the museum's director points out, "are intended only to stimulate the appetite."
YVES SAINT LAURENT
Style, by Hamish Bowles and Florence Müller, Abrams, 258 pages, $55
This gorgeous book is designed to accompany the exhibition Forty Years of Creation in Retrospective (1962-2002) , which has just finished a stay in Montreal and opened in San Francisco. The text provides a useful overview of the iconic designer's career, enriched by the hundreds of drawings and photographs of his work.
LIVE FOREVER
By Elizabeth Peyton, Phaidon, 256 pages, $59.95
Elizabeth Peyton's rise to the top of the international art heap began in 1994 with a largely self-mounted exhibition of portraits at New York's famous Chelsea Hotel. Now, she's getting the retrospective treatment at Manhattan's New Museum of Contemporary Art, and this is the companion volume to that show (which closes Jan. 11). The 150 colour plates are mostly portraits, brushy images of friends and celebrities (Keith Richards, Jarvis Cocker, Sid Vicious) with stylistic tips o' the hat to David Hockney, Egon Schiele and Frank Auerbach.
TRAVEL
INDIA
People, Place, Culture, History, by Abraham Eraly, Yasmin Khan, George Michell and Mitali Saran, DK Publishing, 371 pages, $45
India is big, complex, beautiful and fascinating - like the country, it goes to gorgeous lengths to explain. Subsections thoroughly examine, in imaginative detail, the subcontinent's History, People, Culture, Landscape and Architecture, and offer useful travel advice and speculations about the future. There is interest - and often delight - on every page. Particularly absorbing are the mosaics of illustrated text detailing A Day in the Life of locomotive driver, dance teacher, schoolchild, nobleman, bride, priest.
WHERE TO GO WHEN - THE AMERICAS
North, Central, South America & the Caribbean, edited by Joseph Rosendo, DK, 336 pages, $45
With an infinite amount of time and money, what would be the best way to spend the year ahead? This attractive book is as seductive as The New York Times travel section in winter, but useful enough to stay on your coffee table all year. It is divided, month by month, into the best cities to visit throughout the Americas, with festival listings, cost estimates and local do's and don'ts.
TASCHEN'S PARIS
Hotels, Restaurants & Shops, by Angelika Taschen, Taschen, 400 pages, $47.95
If you love Paris, this sumptuous guide perfectly captures its high-end character and atmosphere. "Those, like most of us, with only a few days in the city have no desire to waste time or money on mediocre bistros or anonymous, run-of-the-mill hotels. ... The usual guides always contain too much information and too few photos. Just to read them would fill an entire holiday - and often the reader is none the wiser afterwards." If money is no object, this is your Paris and your book.
ARCHITECTURE
AND DESIGN
INSIGHT AND ON SITE
The Architecture of Diamond
and Schmitt, by A. J. Diamond, Donald Schmitt and Don Gillmor, Douglas & McIntyre, 347 pages, $60
The Toronto firm of Diamond and Schmitt is responsible for some of the world's most celebrated buildings - the Ontario Science Centre, the New Brunswick Museum, the Banff Centre and, most recently, the Toronto Opera House - and is a champion of urbanism and social responsibility. The 12 essays in this book - one by famed critic Witold Rybczynski, and each centring on a group of D & S buildings - discuss such topics as context, collectivity, beauty, sustainability, the reuse of old structures and building for the arts and education.
SHAKER DESIGN
Out of This World, edited by Jean M. Burks, Yale University Press, 245 pages, $99
There was much more to the Shakers than simple, well-made furniture, though that is what the 19th-century Utopians are mostly noted for today. This book looks at the furniture, of course, but also explores other aspects Shaker design, including household objects, textiles, religious drawings and the gift art that they made for each other, and how it all relates to the movement's spirituality. Nearly 200 colour illustrations.
COLIN & JUSTIN'S HOME HEIST STYLE GUIDE
By Colin McAllister and Justin Ryan, Penguin Canada, 303 pages, $32
The Scottish home-decorating mavens, hosts of the HGTV show Colin & Justin's Home Heist , take the reader on a step-by-step trip from design crime to design delight, beginning with identification of the bad and the ugly and progressing through changes in both structures and accessories. Along the way, they take the time to spotlight some of the worst design crimes they've seen perpetrated.
LAKE HOUSES
By Judy Ross, photographs by John de Visser, Boston Mills Press, 224 pages, $49.95
This book presents cottages to sigh for, especially as it arrives under the tree in the depths of winter. From Muskoka in Ontario to parts unknown, de Visser furnishes 200 colour photographs meant to "capture the essential spirit of lake house life." The spirit is given tangible expression with chapters dedicated to exteriors, living rooms, dining rooms, kitchens, boathouses, bunkies, deck and docks, verandas and porches, wall works and fireplaces, and gardens.
LEGACY IN STONE
Saskatchewan's Stone Buildings, by Margaret Hryniuk and Frank Korvemaker, photographs by Larry Easton, Coteau, 224 pages, $39.85
Many of the 50-plus stone buildings profiled in this book, richly filled with Larry Easton's clear photographs, are abandoned, the stone façades defiantly protesting against their unkept states. Built to last, these buildings are brought to our attention by the authors' descriptions of the occupants and what was happening at the time they were constructed. The reader is treated to historical as well as current images of the buildings, showing you that they stand unchanged in basic structure while the more temporal components - windows, roofs, the surrounding landscape - change or decay.
THE VICTORIAN HOUSE BOOK
A Practical Guide to Home Repair and Decoration, by Robin Guild, Firefly, 320 pages, $49.95
This book serves two purposes: It can inspire those who wish to lovingly restore or sensitively alter a fine, old 19th-century home and offers instruction for those who might execute the plan. Victorian homes are well known for their rich detail, and that's apparent here through the photographs, text and handy architectural drawings, dealing with everything from floor plans to baluster profiles.
ARCHITECTURAL EXCELLENCE
500 Iconic Buildings, edited by Paul Cattermole, Firefly, 512 pages, $49.95
Architecture is the most public of the arts, as this ambitious compendium of cath- edrals, castles, mosques, railway stations and the occasional humble house reminds us. About 400 stunning photographs mark an international journey through the ages from Stonehenge and the Sphinx to the 21st century. En route, there is much you would expect: the Taj Mahal, Machu Picchu, the Chrysler Building. But there are also many surprises, including follies (Rome's Victor Emmanuel Monument) and theme parks (Disneyland's Sleeping Beauty Castle). Habitat 67 is here, as is Buckminster Fuller's Geodesic Dome and Douglas Cardinal's Canadian Museum of Civilization.
HISTORY
BATTLE AT SEA
3,000 Years of Naval Warfare, by R. G. Grant, DK, 360 pages, $45
This ultimate guide to the development of conflict at sea travels from the battles between galleys in ancient Greece to the underwater and undeclared stalking wars between nuclear submarines. With about 500 full-colour photographs and illustrations, it encapsulates every major naval conflict in history.
LIFE IN THE COUNTRY
With Quotations by Jane Austen, Silhouettes by Her Nephew James Edward Austen-Leigh, British Library, unpaginated, $24.95
What a treat, and not just for the legions of Janeites, or amateur historians of the Regency period, but for all lovers of language and image. Austen's characteristically sharp quotes ("Give our love to the little boys, if they can be persuaded to remember us") are nicely wedded to her nephew's charming silhouettes of gentle rustic life: hunter and dog cross a hillock; a mare feeds from a hay trough while her foal feeds on her.
CHURCHILL BY HIMSELF
The Definitive Collection of Quotations, edited by Richard Langworth, Public Affairs, 626 pages, $32
Not a coffee-table book, but the perfect gift for the Churchillian on your list (and surely there will be one). The famous quotes are all here, but there is so much more of interest. For instance, this to his mother, from Winnipeg in 1901: "Fancy, 20 years ago there were only a few mud huts ... and last night a magnificent audience of men in evening dress & ladies half out of it, filled a fine opera house..." Never (Shakespeare aside) was so much owed by so many to so few (just one, actually). It reminds you, if you needed reminding, just what made Churchill, well, Churchill.
WHAT PEOPLE WORE WHEN
A Complete Illustrated History of Costume from Ancient Times to the Nineteenth Century for Every Level of Society, edited by Melissa Leventon, St. Martin's Griffin, 352 pages, $32.95
This is one of those efforts where the title pretty much says it all. Illustrations are rich in colour and detail, as promised by the cover information that the artwork features the work of Friedrich Hottenroth and Auguste Racinet. The text provides an anchoring chronology, but the real appeal is in the visuals.
THE ATLAS OF EXPLORATION
Foreword by John Hemming, Oxford University Press, 256 pages, $55
This second-edition exploration of humans' knack for discovery and dispersal over several millennia goes beyond the many famous treks across water, land and ice to include journeys to the deep sea and planets. It is richly illustrated with period maps and artists' depiction of events of the day (palm trees in upstate New York are duly noted as Champlain did battle with the Iroquois). For an intellectual exploration of how we got from there to here, this is a good starting point.
WE INTERRUPT THIS BROADCAST
The Events That Stopped Our Lives, From the Hindenburg to the Virginia Tech Shooting, by Joe Garner, Sourcebooks Media Fusion, 194 pages, three audio CDs, $54.99
"We interrupt this broadcast" is an iconic phrase that tells us immediately that an unforeseeable event has occurred or that a storm of great intensity is approaching. Broadcaster Joe Garner's clear, insightful style allows the reader to comprehend the full impact of momentous events. Combined with an effective narration by Bill Kurtis and the original broadcasts, this book enables us relive history as it unfolded again and again. It also serves as a reminder that no matter how dire or difficult things seemed at the time, we endured and moved forward.
HISTORICAL ATLAS OF TORONTO
By Derek Hayes, Douglas & McIntyre, 192 pages, $49.95
More than 300 maps, supplemented by period photographs and illustrations, chart Toronto's progress from remote native village to "world city." The real strength is with the early years and the careful reproduction of detail from 17th- and 18-century French and British maps. An abundance of splendid 19th-century maps portray most effectively the city's rapid growth and the immense impact of industrialization. The growth of the suburbs, the ever-changing waterfront, the controversies that came with unfettered expansion - all are here.
PHOTOGRAPHY
ELEPHANT MAN
By Chris Gallucci, photographs by Nomi Baumgartl, Firefly, 160 pages, $39.95
The story of the 30-year relationship between Chris Gallucci, one-time biker and ex-con, and Timbo, the largest bull elephant in North America. They met on the location for the film Roar , when Gallucci, just out of jail, found a job wrangling animals. When star Tippi Hedren bought the setting to establish an animal refuge, Gallucci stayed on, keeping a daily diary. That diary forms most of the text, though Baumgartl's sensitive and moving photographs - of both man and beast - are the book's core.
WILLIAM EGGLESTON
Democratic Camera - Photographs and Video, 1961-2008, by Elisabeth Sussman and Thomas Weski, Whitney Museum of American Art/Yale University Press, 304 pages, $80
U.S. photographer Eggleston, who focused on common people and places - Elvis Presley's Graceland, a freezer stuffed with food, a deserted landscape with a Gulf gasoline sign - is widely credited with giving legitimacy to colour photography as an art form. But this lavishly illustrated volume devotes considerable space to his black-and-white work from the 1950s and '60s, as well as the pioneering video art from his 1970s recordings of Memphis nightlife.
HISTORY OF THE WORLD
IN PHOTOGRAPHS
Plus 20,000 pictures on CD-ROM, Black Dog & Leventhal, 557 pages, $63
The creation of Encyclopedia Britannica and Getty Images, this is a 150-year journey taken through the camera's eye, "beginning in 1850 when photography transformed how the world is recorded." A 6,000-item timeline runs across the pages, providing context for thousands of photographs, drawings and paintings. Among the 1,850 tidbits - jumping rope, or skipping, is becoming popular with kids, especially in England Germany; Irish explorer Robert McClure "becomes the first to traverse the Northwest Passage." It ends with Benazir Bhutto's assassination in 2007.
LIFE
The Classic Collection, Life Books, 144 pages, $32.95
Here are 100 of the most famous photos by famous photographers (Alfred Eisenstaedt, Philippe Halsman, Margaret Bourke-White) from the world's most famous magazine of photojournalism: Fred Astaire leaping, Jackie Robinson running, Bourke-White perched precariously on a Chrysler Building gargoyle. But there's a big bonus: 25 of the photos (the Kennedy brothers in consultation, the Taj Mahal at night) are removable and frameable. Nice idea.
ATHLETE
By Walter Iooss, edited by Terry McDonnell, Sports Illustrated, unpaginated, $38.95
What has always distinguished Sports Illustrated is the quality of its photographs. Long-time SI photographer Walter Iooss presents 150 of his best, ranging from an action shot of tennis player Jimmy Connors from above - hair flying, expression joyful while executing a backhand - to a portrait of seven-foot behemoth Shaquille O'Neal from below - his glower pure intimidation - to an intimate look at Arnold Palmer in conversation with Jack Nicklaus. As noted by editor Terry McDonnell, each of Iooss's pictures leaves meaning that lingers. Oh, and there are images from the infamous swimsuit issues, too.
DARING TO LOOK
Dorothea Lange's Photographs and Reports from the Field, by Anne Whiston Spirn, University of Chicago Press, 359 pages, $40
Here are 149 of Dorothea Lange's photographs, many not seen before, and her field reports from 1939, when 44-year-old Lange was at her pinnacle. As powerful and telling as the photographs are the words Lange wrote about the images; they flesh out our understanding of why she took each photograph. Spirn brings these images and text together for the first time and, with her own photography, shows some of the same places many years later.
THE HALF
Photographs of Actors Preparing for the Stage, by Simon Annand, Faber & Faber, 307 pages, $45
This book lets the images of actors speak for themselves. Caught before they went onstage, in moments of reflection, distraction, boredom, half made up, vulnerable before the stage face is presented. A photograph of Joe Renton, in chain-mail armour, playing pool before being called to perform shows the juxtaposition of real life and pretend. Kevin Spacey, plucking his eyebrows as he intently stares into a circular mirror, reveals to us the man unshielded by costume and makeup.
PERFORMANCE
By Richard Avedon, Abrams, 304 pages, $85
Fans of Avedon will recognize the style he developed in In The American West scattered throughout the book, but, almost jarringly, many other images of performers and performances in this monolithic collection were taken in a style recalling free-form, grainy images from the 1930s. Although the images span most of his career as documentarist to the arts, it is in those loose-framed and frequently candid photographs that we find a more human side of Avedon's work. These images are not cold or removed. More often, they share a warmth and love of life that feels intoxicating.
FORTY YEARS OF PHOTOGRAPHING ON THE SET
Seen behind the scene, by Mary Ellen Mark, Phaidon, 264 pages, $59.95
Imagine a wedding where all guests are your friends and family, but the event is catered by a Parisian gourmand; or a tour of a natural history museum with Darwin as your guide; or even a local drawing class with Degas whispering tips in your ear. Mary Ellen Mark, photographing on movie sets between takes, is that gourmand, Darwin, Degas in this delicious tome of photojournalistic insights into actors, directors and extras as they build their tales for the silver screen. As a journalist, Mark has few in her peerage, and to apply those skills to the famous and infamous is treat.
EQUUS
By Tim Flach, Abrams, 304 pages, $65
British photographer Tim Flach has assembled an astounding collection of photos as a tribute to the horse, an animal that has "carried man on his journey for centuries." This is a glorious picture book, with text confined only to captions, with photos taken in the wild and in the studio.
AFRICAN AIR
By George Steinmetz, Abrams, 205 pages, $44
Every continent will have its own aerially viewed charms, but there's something special about Africa, and it's fully on display in this glorious collection from a distinguished nature photographer. Whether it's jagged sandstone pinnacles in the Chad desert (you can feel the heat and isolation), a bleakly beautiful swamp forest in the Niger delta or lions lazing in Botswana's Okavango, there's something to make you catch your breath on every page.
VANITY FAIR, THE PORTRAITS
A Century of Iconic Images, Graydon Carter and the editors
of Vanity Fair, Abrams, 383 pages, $72
They say nobody ever reads the text in a book of photographs. That adage holds here, despite essays by Christopher Hitchens and VF editor Graydon Carter, for how could mere words - however stylish - compete with photographs by Edward Steichen, Cecil Beaton, Man Ray and Annie Leibovitz? For nearly a century, Vanity Fair has been amassing an archive of celebrity photographs ranging from Lillian Gish, Pablo Picasso and Augustus John to Madonna, George Clooney and Toni Morrison. Portraits are one thing, but VF delights in boundary busting - a naked and very pregnant Demi Moore - and in provocative juxtapositions, the overly-preserved and buxom Collins sisters across from the demure Gishes, the late Princess of Wales in 1997 coupled with a later portrait of her son William. In the end, a haunting portrait of the age of celebrity.
THE DAWN OF THE COLOR PHOTOGRAPH
Albert Kahn's Archives of the Planet, by David Okuefuna, Princeton University Press, $59.50
When the Lumière brothers invented colour photography in 1907, one of their countrymen immediately saw in it the possibility of promoting cross-cultural understanding. Albert Kahn, a banker and pacifist from Paris, dispatched photographers around the globe to document the people they found. For the next 20 years, they immortalized Germans, Montenegrins, Egyptians, Mongolians and every other manner of global citizen. This isn't a book about photography; it's a pictorial history of the colour-saturated world that existed before we all started wearing blue jeans and Nike T-shirts.
WISDOM
The Greatest Gift One Generation Can Give to Another, by Andrew Zuckerman, Abrams, 215 pages, $55
As a companion volume to the website and video interviews, this book of portraits of people past 60 and what sage words they might have to impart is clean and efficient. We are presented with the likenesses and wisdom of people; some famous, some less so. "The heart is what matters most of all," Kris Kristofferson opines. Perhaps it is these few words that best spell out the intention of this work.
POP SIXTIES
Magnum Photos, introduction by Anthony DeCurtis, 191 pages, $32.95
This mid-sized book provides an immersion in one of the most turbulent decades in recent history, as seen through the eyes of some of the most talented documentary photographers of their time. Protests, politicians, rock festivals, subcultures and celebrities from Hitchcock to John Lee Hooker are chronicled in colour and black and white. Photographs of John Kennedy's election campaign and subsequent assassination prove particularly arresting at the dawning of the Obama years.
BROUGHT TO LIGHT
Photography and the Invisible 1940-1900, edited by Corey Keller, with essays by Jennifer Tucker et al., Yale University Press, 216 pages, $50
Cameras, microscopes, telescopes and X-rays have allowed humans to see what no one had seen before. It's easy to take these things for granted now, but early images of human bones, the structure of snowflakes, electromagnetic patterns, the movement of stars - as well as the ghost of Abraham Lincoln - help to capture the excitement and awe that came with these 19th-century inventions.
NATURE
ANIMALS
A Visual Encyclopedia, edited by Carrie Love and Caroline Stamps, 304 pages,$32.99
This book is beautifully designed, and even children will enjoy its large, colourful photos (an alligator carrying its baby in its mouth, the newt in all its yellow glory), witty headings and bite-sized chunks of information on everything from that existential question, "What is a reptile?" to the hidden weapon of the world's largest toad (too scary to be revealed here). This gorgeous book is hours of fun to explore.
MISSION SPACE
A Full-Throttle Tour of the Universe, by Carole Stott, DK, 128 pages, $24.95

AMAZING BABY
By Desmond Morris, Firefly, 192 pages, $40
The British zoologist and ethnologist who first found fame in 1967 with his book The Naked Ape takes a similar approach with the astonishing story of the first two years in the life of a baby. Irresistible!
BURDOCK
By Janet Malcolm, Yale University Press, 29 pages, $70
Janet Malcolm hooked me the moment I opened this gorgeous update on the botanical art book about a common weed, cursed by pet owners and gardeners alike because of its burrs. Malcolm, a celebrated New York writer, here limits herself to a two-page essay leaving the reader to ponder the meaning of 28 colour photographs of burdock leaves. She explains that she prefers "older, flawed leaves to young, unblemished specimens - leaves to which something has happened." The book is a brash concept, but it works as a spare story of decaying beauty.
FLOWERS AND HERBS OF EARLY AMERICA
Lawrence D. Griffith, Photography by Barbara Temple Lombardi, Colonial Williamsburg Foundation/Yale University Press, 292 pages, $60
Hard to say whether this belongs on the coffee table or in the potting shed. Further, hard to say whether Lawrence Griffith's thorough and insightful description of plants of North America's original flora complements Barbara Lombardi's dew-speckled close-ups of the likes of borage - or vice versa. Whether you're moved by environmentalism or the love of gardening, this book might inspire and instruct if you choose to go wild with the likes of blue pimpernel or passionflower.

Secrets of the Southern Continent, by David McGonigal, Firefly, 400 pages, $59.95
This least hospitable continent has a powerful grip on the human imagination. And those who want to learn more about the vast frozen land mass at the bottom of the world will be well rewarded with this gorgeous and comprehensive book.

There's also a detailed discussion of how climate change is altering the last true wilderness.
EXTRAORDINARY LEAVES
Stephen Green-Armytage and Dennis Schrader, Firefly, 272 pages, $45
Exquisite photographs get you up close and personal with poinsettia, holly, lettuce, tobacco, moss and marijuana. This is an inspired celebration of colour and pattern, form and texture that will make you see leaves in a whole new light. Photographer Stephen Green-Armytage was tired of flowers getting all the glory. Botanist Dennis Schrader adds insight with his commentary.
THE OWL AND THE WOODPECKER
Encounters with North America's Most Iconic Birds, by Paul Bannick, Mountaineers Books, 200 pages, one audio CD, $24.95
A definite must for bird lovers. Via stunning photographs, Bannick,, a naturalist and outdoor educator, introduces us to owls and woodpeckers either in flight or in search of food. To complement this treat, an audio naturalist has recorded their sounds on an accompanying CD. Even as a child, the author was convinced that if we got to know these beautiful, graceful creatures we would protect them, because they are nature's poetry. This lovely book certainly won't hurt his cause.
ARCTIC VISIONS
Pictures from a Vanished World, by Fred Bruemmer, Key Porter, 279 pages, $45
Photographer Fred Bruemmer spent six months of each year for the past 30 years travelling through the Arctic to record an ancient and dying way of life. He followed the people on their hunting trips up a mountain or onto the vast sea of ice and thoughtfully recorded everything for posterity. The photos, shot in stark black and white, capture the pain and the laughter and the harshness of the land, but also the serenity and peace. A book for anyone who cares about the North and its people.

If you're a Scrabble fan, here's how to spell W-O-W. With more than 100,000 two-to-eight-letter words, some with variant spellings, this is word play d-e-l-i-g-h-t. Look for boxes with origins and meanings of words (muscle comes from the Latin musculus , which originally meant little mouse), and lists, such as four-vowel, six-letter words (iguana) and two-to-five-letter words that contain x (nexus) and z (zineb). Zineb? An insecticide.

It explains, in textbook form, everything from properties to cutting, clarity and even cleaning. Each stone has a chapter, rich in photographs and charts, to inform and illustrate.
7000 YEARS OF JEWELRY
An Illustrated History from the Collections of the British Museum, edited by Hugh Tait, Firefly Books, 256 pages, $29.95
Every civilization has its bling and, although thousands of years ago jewellery may have started as a collection of shells and coloured stones, it grew to become a symbol of wealth and status. To the historian, there's more to jewellery than something worn to show off. It also defines culture, customs and industrial development. Using hundreds of photographs of pieces from the British Museum, the book tells a fascinating story of the world's people through their jewellery.

At the other we find Gong, known to just 100 villagers living in a couple of settlements in western Thailand (and, perversely, spoken in a different dialect in each village). One Thousand Languages covers all the vast territory in between these two languages, using the colourful and informative tools of modern textbook typography - pictures, maps, charts, panels - to open wide a window to the boundless diversity of human speech on this planet.

Full text: An inability to draw fans and a faltering economy have left the Coyotes' finances in ruin
The Phoenix Coyotes are expected to lose between $25- and $35-million this year, and with his primary business under financial duress, the question is whether owner Jerry Moyes is able to continue underwriting the NHL franchise's losses.
After an encouraging spike in paid attendance over the first five games this season, thanks to a young and exciting hockey team, the crowds have decreased as the Coyotes faltered on the ice. But even with the small increase in attendance, the Coyotes are still near the bottom of the NHL in revenue. Consequently, Moyes may be looking to sell the team or he could be forced to put it into bankruptcy if he cannot persuade the city to alter leasing terms on Jobing.com Arena.
The Coyotes signed a 30-year lease with the City of Glendale when they moved into the arena in December of 2003. The lease calls for large financial penalties if the agreement is broken, but if the club is placed into bankruptcy, it can break the lease through U.S. bankruptcy laws.
However, Moyes could ease his potential losses by renegotiating the lease so the club could receive subsidies from the city and more revenue from the arena. This was done in Nashville when a local group bought the Predators from former owner Craig Leipold.
Moyes, 64, took his company, Swift Transportation, private in May of 2007 with debt financing of $2.74-billion (all figures U.S.). The Globe and Mail obtained an analysis of the company done by a corporate credit analyst for a U.S. financial management company that shows Swift Transportation lent Moyes $560-million as part of the takeover. He guaranteed the loan.
Swift Transportation, one of the largest truck carriers in the United States, ran into a financial hurricane of rising fuel prices and a falling economy. The entire industry has been hit hard by the double whammy of high costs and low demand.
In June, Moody's Investors Service changed its outlook on the company to "negative" from stable. By late November, the junk bonds issued to finance Moyes's takeover are currently trading at 18 cents on the dollar and bank debt is between 46 and 50 cents on the dollar, according to the U.S. corporate credit analyst. This means the bond market believes Swift Transportation's outlook is grim.
Two sources said Moyes is so eager to unload the Coyotes that he approached his former partner, Steve Ellman, about buying the team back.
"The answer was short and emphatic," one of the sources said of Ellman's refusal.
Club management has a more positive outlook.
"I am confident not only that hockey will be here in five years, but that we will be doing well in five years," Coyotes governor and chief executive officer Jeff Shumway said, pointing to improved ticket and suite sales and fewer giveaways. "We run a great franchise in a great sport, a sport we love. And we're in one of the fastest-growing markets in the U.S."
Shumway's optimism is not shared by many throughout the NHL.
"I don't know how they can sustain the losses," one former league governor said. "The team loses so much money you can't sell it. If I were offered the team for a dollar, I'd say no because you can't fix it."
He estimates the Coyotes have lost more than $200-million since 2001 - $80-million more than the purchase price. The Coyotes regularly receive payments from the NHL's revenue-sharing plan, introduced after the 2004-05 lockout.
A Swift Transportation spokesman said Moyes would not be interviewed, and Shumway would not confirm the estimate of the Coyotes' losses.
"All we've ever been willing to say is we lose a substantial amount of money," he said. Shumway has admitted to the Arizona Republic newspaper that the club lost about $30-million in 2006-07.
The Coyotes, after five consecutive years of missing the playoffs, have assembled a talented young team under head coach Wayne Gretzky. Attendance is down slightly from last year's average so far this season, and the average ticket price of $31 ranks 29th out of 30 clubs. Like all NHL franchises, the lack of television money compromises the balance sheet.
"This team has to win," NHL Players' Association executive director Paul Kelly said after a recent visit to Phoenix. "If you just look at the numbers on a page, you would say, 'Back up the truck and pull them out of there.' But if they get some home [playoff] dates and qualify for their full share of revenue sharing, they've got a good chance."
Moyes, along with Ellman, purchased the Coyotes in 2001 for $120-million and bought out Ellman's interest two years ago. It is not known whether Moyes paid Ellman any cash, but Ellman did receive control of the real-estate project around the arena as part of the deal.
Ellman's original plan had been to build an arena in the affluent city of Scottsdale, where many of the team's fans lived. When the city refused the terms, they made a deal with Glendale, a working-class suburb on the opposite side of Phoenix. Glendale provided $180-million of the building's $220-million cost.
The Coyotes are no strangers to the upper-bowl phenomenon, whereby the cheaper seats at the top of the arena are filled, but thousands of seats in the expensive lower bowl are empty. One Scottsdale-based businessman said the club offers significant discounts on its most expensive seats, further suppressing revenue.
"The big-money guys, the corporate guys, don't live in Glendale," Kelly said. "If you live in Scottsdale, Glendale is not an easy place to get to. That hurts them in the area like club seats and boxes. You could see evidence of that the other night [at a Coyotes game]."
An apparent option for Moyes is to enter the franchise into bankruptcy protection. The strategy would allow the franchise to break the lease under U.S. bankruptcy laws. The franchise could then be sold and relocated.
NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly said in an e-mail the Coyotes' financial problems are not considered overwhelming and sought to quash rumours the club came close to missing a payroll.
"I'm not in a position to comment on Mr. Moyes's personal financial situation or the financial condition of Swift," Daly said. "I can confirm that we are not concerned about the Coyotes missing payroll, nor have they ever come close to missing payroll.
"I can also confirm that I do not expect the team to file for bankruptcy protection."
A banking source said the Coyotes are talking to Citibank about a loan. Citibank, which is having its own financial difficulties, declined to comment.
By the numbers
The gap between ticket revenue and player payroll offers an indication of the Phoenix Coyotes' troubles, but does not paint a complete financial picture. The club has many other additional expenses, such as loan payments, that drive up the losses.

Closed mines, broken dreams in the town that nickel built

Author: Hoffman, Andy

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/closed-mines-broken-dreams-town-that-nickel-built/docview/382683549/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: The nickel price had been trending down for much of the year but things didn't really begin to unravel until October. That's when First Nickel shut its Lockerby mine, laying off 150 workers. FNX Mining then closed its Levack mine and Xstrata announced plans to shutter two mines ahead of schedule. Perhaps most alarming for the local economy, Xstrata's Sudbury workers didn't get a nickel bonus in the third quarter, the first time that's happened in years.

Full text: When John Rodriguez became Mayor of Sudbury in November, 2006, things had never looked better for the city whose economic fortunes have always been inextricably linked to the price of nickel.
The price of the metal was rocketing to record levels and Mr. Rodriguez saw opportunity for Sudbury to spiff up its image and shed its reputation as a hardscrabble mining town beholden to the vagaries of the boom and bust commodity cycle.
He unveiled plans for a massive recreation complex and a $167-million performing arts centre. Mr. Rodriguez planned to tap the new foreign owners of the region's major nickel operations for cash. Brazil's Companhia Vale do Rio Doce and Swiss-based Xstrata PLC had just shelled out nearly $40-billion combined to buy in to the Sudbury Basin. "I was going to ask for big bucks," Mr. Rodriguez said in an interview.
Yet the mayor's dreams of building a world-class performing arts centre are now on hold. Vale and Xstrata are cutting production in Sudbury and closing mines because of a sudden and severe crash in base metal prices brought on by the global financial crisis.
"This is not the time to do it because the economy is falling apart," he said.
For Sudbury, the rapid nosedive in commodity prices could spell the loss of major opportunity. Just as the city was finding its economic groove, it is suddenly staring down the barrel of what could prove a dreadful downturn.
Mines are being shut down around the world in response to plunging prices and mining centres such as Sudbury are bracing for the fallout. Trading at all time highs in July, the price of copper has been cut in half. Nickel has been hit even harder, falling 65 per cent this year.
Yesterday, the grim reality of the global financial crisis and the commodity collapse took a further toll on Sudbury. Vale Inco Ltd., the city's largest employer, with more than 5,000 workers, confirmed it will close its Copper Cliff South mine for an "undetermined period." The company's Voisey's Bay mine in Newfoundland, which ships nickel to facilities in Sudbury for processing, will be shut down during the entire month of July. The company also put off the development of its Copper Cliff Deep project, deferring the expenditure of $138-million (U.S.) for at least a year.
Copper Cliff South's 365 employees will be redeployed to other operations but eligible Vale Inco employees will be offered early retirement as the company reduces the number of employees in Sudbury over all. "There is no point having production if there is no demand," Vale's chief executive officer, Roger Agnelli, said at an event in Sao Paulo yesterday. "In Sudbury, there are deeper mines that have a higher cost."
Those comments stand in sharp contrast to the gushing praise for Sudbury and Canada that Mr. Agnelli expressed on a conference call to sell Vale's all-cash bid to Toronto-based Inco Ltd. shareholders in August, 2006.
"Canada is a mining country. It's a country that has the legislation, experience, tradition, and very good people who work inside this sector. So it was very important for us to be in a country like Canada ... we had a dream - we had a dream to be there," he said.
Now Mr. Agnelli's dream has become a headache for his company. At the Vale Inco offices in Toronto yesterday, 55 temporary, part-time and contract workers lost their jobs and another 12 positions in areas such as corporate strategy and legal affairs were declared "redundant."
Sudbury is also preparing for a dramatic reversal of fortune. But the head of the city's largest union believes the contagion created by the Wall Street greed and the subprime mortgage meltdown are the cause, not Sudbury itself.
"It's the world. It's not just Sudbury, it's not just Inco, it's the whole world," said John Fera, the president of United Steelworkers Local 6500, a union that represents some 3,500 Inco workers in Sudbury.
Before the crash, local housing prices had jumped to record levels and the once-dismal Sudbury real estate market had even begun to attract speculators.
In 2007, it wasn't uncommon for Sudbury miners to earn more than $150,000 (Canadian) a year, thanks to their nickel bonuses which are based on metal prices and company profits. Pickup trucks, ATVs, motorcycles, boats, snowmobiles and jet skis were selling briskly to Vale Inco and Xstrata miners who were flush with cash. An estimated 12,000 other people in the region with jobs servicing the then-booming mining sector were also enjoying unprecedented good times.
"There are some people, young and old, who have made purchases that they are concerned about. But we're going to help them through it," Mr. Fera said.
The nickel price had been trending down for much of the year but things didn't really begin to unravel until October. That's when First Nickel shut its Lockerby mine, laying off 150 workers. FNX Mining then closed its Levack mine and Xstrata announced plans to shutter two mines ahead of schedule. Perhaps most alarming for the local economy, Xstrata's Sudbury workers didn't get a nickel bonus in the third quarter, the first time that's happened in years.
"We were disappointed that we couldn't pay it but the conditions weren't right," Marc Boissonneault, vice-president of Xstrata Nickel's Sudbury operations, said in an interview at the company's Nickel Rim South project.
Nickel Rim South and the Fraser Morgan mines are slated to replace the Craig and Thayer-Lindsley operations, which will both close next year. The new projects will be lower cost, in part because they also contain plenty of copper and precious metals such as platinum and palladium, Mr. Boissonneault said.
In the meantime, Xstrata has had to scramble for feed for its smelter and has even begun shipping ore to Sudbury from its nickel operations in Australia. The Xstrata smelter had processed the ore from mines that are now closed such as Lockerby and North American Palladium Ltd.'s Lac des Iles mine near Thunder Bay.
To some, a key question is whether Xstrata and Vale will ever be able to reach a joint venture agreement that could save hundreds of millions of dollars a year and help cement Sudbury's future as a viable mining camp for decades to come.
Before they fell to Vale and Xstrata, Inco and rival Falconbridge Ltd. had proposed their own merger. At the time, they said cost savings from sharing resources in Sudbury could top $550-million (U.S.) a year.
With smaller mines and more challenges keeping its smelter at full capacity, Xstrata has more to gain from a joint venture deal. But the two sides haven't talked for months and it is unclear whether the metal price downturn will spur renewed discussions. "Is there opportunity? Yes, there is. Are we open to acting on some of those opportunities that increase value? Of course we are," Mr. Boissonneault said.
Mr. Rodriquez, meanwhile, believes that while Sudbury won't be able to dodge the impact of the commodities crash, the city's more diversified economy, which now includes major contributions from health care and post secondary education, will soften the blow. "If the mines suffer a flu, we don't all get pneumonia now," the mayor said.

Full text: Since publishing St. Clair West in Pictures, author notes residents who walk a little taller
Despite the silly headphones with animal faces painted on them, the little girl's gaze is steely, serious. As she stares at the library computer screen, her tiny hand gripping the mouse, Little Red Riding Hood confronts the Big Bad Wolf in the mural above her.
In another part of the Dufferin/St. Clair library - the newly minted Earlscourt Room - a man at least eight decades the girl's senior conducts studies of his own. Alan Shaw steadies a magnifying glass over a book on local history, even though he's lived in the same neighbourhood his entire life and probably knows more than the author.
The main room is buzzing as well. There are at least as many people reading or surfing the 'net as there are populating its colourful murals, perhaps more. In the month since extensive renovations by Makrimichalos Cugini Architects were unveiled, this is, once again, the living room of the community.
Barbara Myrvold, co-author of St. Clair West in Pictures (Toronto Public Library, 2008) and co-ordinator of the TPL's online "Historicity" initiative, is as happy to see this activity as she is to show me the restored murals above our heads.
Depicting bucolic scenes, the murals were created in 1926 by Ontario College of Art principal George A. Reid and famed Scarborough painter Doris McCarthy in 1932. But they were painted over during a 1964 renovation.
After the first edition of Ms. Myrvold's (and co-author Nancy Byers) book came out in 1997, interest in the forgotten murals became so great that a local resident's group raised enough money to restore a small section in 2004. In a perfect and rare story of grassroots/government symbiosis, the library financed the restoration of the remaining panels this year, including Ms. McCarthy's fairytale depictions in the children's area.
Ms. Myrvold has agreed to make the expanded 158-page third edition come alive by taking me on an "architour" (although an armchair and a good reading lamp would have sufficed), starting with St. Clare, the nearby Arthur W. Holmes-designed Roman Catholic church, built in 1913-14, and found on page 69.
"He used Italian churches as models," she explains, "and I think it's kind of interesting because this neighbourhood was totally Irish-Catholic at the time he built it, and then it became so Italian.
"I always think the people must have felt right at home."
We pass the massive Hungarian Canadian Cultural Centre (formerly the Shaarei Shomayim Synagogue) and head to the former home of John Thomas Paxton, built in 1890 and still extant on Winona Drive. Mr. Paxton, I'm told, was a gardener at the Honourable John Ross's Earlscourt, an Italianate mansion that once stood on the hill at the northwest corner of Davenport Road and Dufferin Street, and gave the area its name.
Hugging the glacial Lake Iroquois shoreline along Regal Road, we discuss how the now-buried Garrison Creek shaped streets such as Springmount Avenue.
Admiring the large, handsome houses, we come to the beaux-arts-style Regal Road School, noteworthy for the recent restoration of its Birmingham Buff sandstone portico, which garnered an honourable mention at the 2008 Heritage Toronto Awards last month. (Now it can be told: Your humble Architourist served as a juror.)
Stretching down Lansdowne Avenue from Davenport like a long, dark finger, the former Canada Foundry Co. - now converted into lofts - is our next stop. Although crowded recently by inappropriate mansard-roofed townhouses (matching the dark chocolate-coloured brick of the industrial buildings would have done wonders), the scale of the remaining few buildings makes it easy to imagine the site as illustrated on page 88.
"It was an amazing facility," says Ms. Myrvold, adding that everything from locomotives to ornamental gates was fabricated there.
Speaking of fabrication, we end our tour hunting for any surviving self-built "shacktown" houses from a century ago. As the book points out, the suburbs (and indeed this was suburbia then) were attractive to British immigrants because "inner-city rents were high and vacancies rare," she says.
In addition to cheap land, Earlscourt was attractive because "building restrictions and permits were almost non-existent in York Township."
Based on a tip from the studious Mr. Shaw back at the library, we wend our way up Boon, Earlscourt and Nairn avenues. It's hard to tell, but we decide that likely candidates are those that are super-narrow, have simple peaked roofs and, in some cases, are clad in Insulbrick. As a final treat, we stop to admire the very domestic-looking 1920 firehall at the corner of Ascot and Earlscourt avenues. Save for the glass garage doors, it hasn't changed a bit.
What has changed in this neighbourhood, Ms. Myrvold says, is the attitude toward local history since the award-winning St. Clair West in Pictures was first published. Residents walk a little taller, the Dufferin/St. Clair library has been reborn, and the TTC plans to erect historical plaques on its new streetcar right-of-way using information from the book.
And so they should. Just like the dozen other books Ms. Myrvold has been involved with for the TPL, this is a thoroughly researched document of a place that is all but gone. In this case, it's a mostly working-class area just like the kind almost everyone has lived in at one time but almost every publisher overlooks.
"The commercial publishers will do, you know, the Annex or Rosedale," she says, "but neighbourhoods like this, they're a bit off the radar."
Thanks to the Toronto Public Library, that's no longer the case.

Full text: Sourcing, harvesting methods, production process all factor into how green materials are
We all should use the best flooring products there are in our renovations - and by that I mean products that are sustainable, natural and eco-friendly. You'd be surprised by the amount of debate around "natural" flooring - you'd think it was pretty clear. But what is often marketed as "natural" and "good for environment" might not always be.
We're familiar with hardwood flooring and natural stone tile. Both come from the earth, so they're definitely natural. But the processing required to get marble or slate out of the ground isn't so earth-friendly, and the methods of harvesting some hardwood forests, say in Brazil, are questionable.
Even the North American lumber industry isn't perfect - a lot of harvest practices are harmful.
Then you need to consider the processing and shipping of the products, and how they are applied in your home, and how you need to maintain them so they keep on looking good. How "good for the environment" is all of that? You need to look at the whole picture.
Is it renewable?
Traditional hardwoods take many years, maybe a lifetime, to grow to maturity, so they aren't generally considered a renewable resource. And obviously, stone for tile, even though it lasts a long time, won't renew at all.
But some products, such as cork or bamboo, regenerate quickly, and can be harvested in less than 10 years. That makes them a good sustainable flooring choice.
Bamboo is a grass, which grows very quickly, and so it's extremely renewable. But there's some debate that forests are being cut down to allow for bamboo plantations, and that the bamboo is grown using large amounts of fertilizer, which of course damages the local environment. Some growers will only use natural fertilizers, but you still have to ask the question.
However, in many countries that supply bamboo, it's grown as a crop in areas that were already deforested. It cleans toxins in air and water, and it can be grown and harvested repeatedly without degrading the soil further.
Cork is harvested from the bark of cork trees. Much of the cork used for flooring is a byproduct of the wine cork industries, so it's a bonus to use the waste material. But cork production is outstripping renewability in some areas.
Both cork and bamboo are often bound and laminated with adhesives that emit high levels of volatile organic compounds, which offsets some of the environmental benefits of using them as flooring material. But many bamboo- and cork-flooring manufacturers often use low or no-VOC adhesives.
Buy certified
The bottom line is that the consumer needs to be very careful and do the homework. Research the products and make sure you really are getting a green product.
One way is to look for Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) certification on wood products. FSC is the independent environmental standard for responsible management of the world's forests. There aren't that many suppliers of FSC bamboo and cork in North America, which means you have less product available, and the cost will be higher to go green.
Marmoleum
Another ecologically-friendly flooring to consider is Marmoleum. You probably know it - it's been in use in schools and hospitals for a long time, and it's not expensive. It's made from linseed oil, wood flour and pine rosin, so it's a natural product.
The problem with this flooring has been how it has been applied in some cases, using adhesives high in VOC emissions, and how it has been cared for using cleaners and polishers that affect indoor air quality.
When it comes to flooring, choosing the right product alone isn't enough; you've got to make sure it's installed right, and that you maintain it right.
If you choose flooring material that's made from rapidly renewable materials, make sure it's installed with low-VOC adhesives and use natural cleaners, that way you'll really be going green.

Full text:   Reopening Leopold Café, even for a few hours, shows Mumbai's famous resilience
The blood stains were mopped up. Some bullet holes were crudely patched, while others were chillingly visible. Just four days after terrorists killed 10 people in a hail of bullets at the Leopold Café, the shutters of the 137-year-old Mumbai landmark were rolled up again amid a swarming crowd chanting jingoistic slogans.
"We need to prove to terrorists that we've won and they've lost," said Ferhan Farzad Jehani, the defiant owner of the Leopold, which was among the first of nearly a dozen places to be attacked Wednesday. He was able to open the café briefly yesterday, before police forced him to close it down again because it was still a crime scene.
The Leopold became a regular haunt for locals as well as foreign backpackers, often seen clutching dog-eared copies of Shantaram , a roman à clef by Australian writer Gregory David Roberts, in which the restaurant finds mention.
After black-clad Indian commandos finally killed or captured the last of the gunmen, life began returning to normal yesterday, and not just at the Leopold.
The honking cars were back. Vegetable hawkers, street-food vendors and lemonade sellers filled up streets that had been desolate for days.
But it will be a long time before the Taj Mahal Palace & Tower hotel reaches anything approaching normal.
Shards of broken glass littered the ground. Curtains that had been knotted together to double as escape ropes dangled out of windows.
Paramedics, firefighters and bomb-disposal squads were still working their way through every room yesterday, clearing the hotel of bodies and any residual threats.
"You cannot imagine the extent of the damage inside the hotel," said firefighter Sanjay Jadhav, 36. "There's complete devastation. This will take years to fix."
The owners of the Taj Palace and the Oberoi Trident - the other hotel targeted - have vowed to rebuild their facilities.
Ankur Chawla, 22, a Taj trainee who was rescued six hours after the terror strike began, was led back inside the hotel on the weekend with other employees to assist investigators.
The bar, where he had been serving drinks when the first crackle of gunfire was heard, was beyond recognition.
"The table where I was serving drinks was stained with blood," he said. "Bullet cartridges lay on the floor, the glasses behind the bar counter were reduced to shards and a gunpowder-like smell [filled] the air. It appears the terrorists had only two motives: to cause maximum destruction and to kill."
Funerals were conducted on the weekend for many of the victims. For many citizens of Mumbai, a city that has been the target of terrorist attacks before, this was the most devastating. Perhaps not in terms of the number of dead, but in terms of psychological damage.
The style, scale and magnitude of last week's attacks was unprecedented. Mumbai had endured bombings on commuter trains and in public places, but this was the first time that gun-wielding men stormed streets and posh hotels, killing indiscriminately.
"This is the worst terror attack in India," said Ram Puniyani, 63, the secretary of the All India Secular Forum, a local non-governmental organization. "There's widespread shock, but I'm sure it'll soon return to life as usual."
After almost every horrific incident in the Mumbai's checkered history - serial bombings in 1993, the monsoon deluge in 2005, bombings on commuter trains in 2006 - Mr. Puniyani said the city of 13 million has always exhibited a rare resilience and spirit to spring quickly back to normal.
But there is also anger at India's politicians over their ineptness in dealing with the repeated terror attacks across the country. Last night, protesters held a candlelight vigil outside the Taj. One placard stood out; lying on the ground, surrounded by candles, it read: "Less politics, more security."
"There's one terror attack after another in this city and the guilty are never punished," said Lucky Handa, a 20-year-old real-estate agent. "It's like lives come cheap in India,"
Mr. Handa's 49-year-old mother, Aruna, was trapped for 36 hours on the 19th floor of the Taj. Mrs. Handa emerged unscathed after being rescued by commandos, but the mental trauma had not subsided.
"Pakistan's [intelligence] chief has audaciously refused to come to India to help with the investigation," Mr. Handa said. "What the heck is India doing about it? Nothing."

Full text:   Summits View
Location: Squamish
Type: Condo suites and towns
DEVELOPER: Solterra Development Corp.
PRICE: $284,900 to $744,900
SIZE: 576 to 1,513 square feet
SALES CENTRE: 1240 Pemberton Ave., Squamish, and 872 Seymour St., Vancouver
CONTACT: 1-877-892-5888 (Squamish), 1-866-789-8386 (Vancouver) or www.eaglewindsquamish.com
As is fitting for a development located mid-way between downtown Vancouver and Whistler Village, the developer of Summits View in Squamish is creating homes that are one part ski chalet, one part urban condo.
The blend of townhouses and mid-rise apartments is the first phase of Solterra Development Corp.'s master-planned Eaglewind community.
"Summits View has been designed for individuals who seek all the luxuries of a downtown Vancouver home, with all the rustic charm of a Whistler vacation home," says Laura Rizzo, Solterra's vice-president of marketing.
The Squamish area has long been popular with enthusiasts of mountain biking, rock climbing, windsurfing, hiking, fishing and back-country skiing, but it is also "rich in future potential," Ms. Rizzo explains.
The whole city is undergoing a major transformation that will continue even after the 2010 Winter Olympics and completion of the Sea to Sky Highway improvements, "giving home buyers much to look forward to," she adds.
There are proposals for a rapid ferry service to connect downtown Squamish to downtown Vancouver, as well as an 80-acre waterfront development and a world-class ski resort featuring two PGA golf courses.
The six-storey Summits View building contains 134 units. Apartments feature natural gas fireplaces, stone countertops and a mixture of wide-plank laminate wood flooring and Berber carpeting.
The kitchens are equipped with stainless-steel appliances.
The building itself offers amenities that include a media and games rooms and a rooftop courtyard.
To cater to outdoor enthusiasts, a dog-wash station as well as a ski-waxing and bike tune-up area are offered.
When completed, the 25-acre Eaglewind development will include an 11-acre public park, a gym and juice bar, a commercial/retail building called Eaglewind Landing, a pedestrian piazza showcasing the works of local artist Mike Tyler, and a 10,000-square-foot seniors' centre.

Full text:   Residential boom is drawing merchants back to the downtown area
Toronto's Yonge Street south of Yorkville has taken a long time to decide just what it wants to be.
Laid out in the 1790s as our great road north, Yonge seemed destined to become an important commercial thoroughfare. It never happened in Georgian and Victorian times.
Then, in the 1920s, the Eaton family of merchants decided to plant an art deco skyscraper and store at the intersection of Yonge and College. For a while, it looked like this stylish tower would give Yonge a game-changing commercial focus. But the Great Depression halted this scheme.
Even architect Eberhard Zeidler's magnificent Eaton Centre - the family's second attempt to regenerate the avenue, completed in the 1970s - did not relieve Yonge of its unrelenting shabbiness.
In the past few years, however, the Yonge Street scene has been undergoing dramatic change. Signs point to lower Yonge at last finding its proper place in the city's fabric as a middle-brow shopping promenade: the opening of Yonge-Dundas Square and its swift evolution into a vivacious (and controversial) centre of metropolitan life, the sprouting of condominium towers in the neighbourhood, and the arrival of downtown versions of Best Buy, Future Shop and other popular retailers near Yonge and Dundas.
It's still a little rough down there. And don't expect to discover anything like the ritzy boutiques of Bloor West, or the chic shops of Queen West. Expect to find, instead, one of Toronto's newest bustling strips of mid-market urban vitality.
Recent news that this pickup is hastening comes from the developer of the mammoth condominium tower called Aura, due to rise at the corner of Yonge and Gerrard Street West, at the very heart of the Yonge Street phenomenon. Canderel Stoneridge Equity Group has announced that giant U.S. retailer Bed Bath & Beyond (BBB), most frequently encountered in big-box stores at suburban shopping malls, will occupy 500,000 square feet of space in Aura's massive base.
When I talked last week with Riz Dhanji, the developer's vice-president for sales and marketing and veteran of Canderel Stoneridge's previous College Park projects on the Yonge Street site, he was downright ecstatic about the new shopping possibilities on the street.
"I think it's absolutely fantastic. The mixed-use development we've envisioned since we started with Aura is going to be a true reality when it is completed. If you looked at our first two phases at College Park, say, seven years ago, they were pretty rundown. There wasn't much retail in this location. You'd walk through College Park, and it was a ghost town.
"You look at it today and it's a zoo. I think what's happening is that the residential [population] has drawn the retail into the downtown locations, and it's become a convenience for people living downtown. Basically, they can shop all underground within walking distance of their apartments and bring it all up to their units. What better way to live in a city?"
Mr. Dhanji said Canderel Stoneridge and the city are working out a plan to link Aura directly to the PATH underground pedestrian system. Aura's BBB and its other shops will thus be connected to the subway, and, via subway, to the whole metropolitan transportation grid.
But BBB's regular customers, Mr. Dhanji believes, will be the some 20,000 people who will live in the area. "I think it will be a very neighbourhood store," he told me, "a signature part of the revitalization of the corner of Yonge and Gerrard."
Nor is this movement of big stores from suburban malls into urban high-rises likely to slow down, as long as increasing numbers of people want to live downtown.
"This is a big trend in high-density living, where you're bringing in different uses into the same block of land," says Jane Renwick, vice-president of Urbanation, a firm that tracks Toronto's high-rise condominium industry.
"When you look at the generic condominium building, with retail at grade, you normally will see a convenience store, a dry cleaner, maybe a little coffee shop - things that don't require a huge critical mass in order to survive. With projects like Aura, which is right in the downtown core, they're also attracting the urban model of the big-box store.
It's fabulous."
But will this onslaught of superstores be terrible for the small, locally owned shops that many downtown people cherish?
"That's an argument you get when Wal-Mart lands in a small town," Ms. Renwick said. "I absolutely hope not. A Home Depot will soon be built on Queen Street West. Is it going to affect the small hardware stores in the neighbourhood? I'd like to think that people shop local, and they like to support their local merchants."
While the long-term effect of this development remains to be seen, it appears that Yonge Street is finally becoming the big-town avenue it was always meant to be.

Full text:   Family's 1961 Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud II is every bit as comfortable as you would expect of a car bearing the nameplate
Sometimes buying an old car can end in tears, but in the case of the 1961
Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud II owned by the McKendry family, the tears came before the purchase.
For Dawn McKendry, they were tears of frustration, a reaction to the car she was bidding on at an auction (and determined to drive home) being knocked down to another buyer.
They were replaced, figuratively at least, by tears of joy a day later when she learned the successful bidder had failed to come up with the required deposit and the car was unsold and hers if she wanted it.
She most definitely did, and a decade later she and her husband Randy and their three girls - Morgan, Victoria and Emma - are enjoying classic motoring in the grand style in an example of one of the world's great luxury automobiles.
"We'd just decided we wanted one," recalls Randy McKendry, who had spent some time trying to track down a suitable Rolls-Royce, only to find one was going under the hammer at an auction house in Ottawa, not far from their Manotick, Ont., home.
On actually seeing the car he says their first reaction was "eeeew, it's green." But then Montreal Canadians hockey fan Dawn discovered it had belonged to legendary player/manager Serge Savard and the colour no longer mattered. Actually it looks very elegant in its pale-over-darker-green
finish.
What the bid had purchased was a very original example of the first Rolls-Royce powered by the big V-8 that was still motivating the cars' stately progress into the early years of this millennium.
Rolls-Royce, after spending the war years building Merlin V-12s for Spitfires and Lancasters, soon returned to car production, introducing its first modern steel-bodied factory-built - as opposed to coach-built - and more affordable car, the Silver Dawn, in 1949.
The Silver Cloud I followed in 1955, with an all-new pressed steel body, also mounted on a separate chassis, and still powered by the existing 4.3-lire inlet-over-exhaust, inline-six. The Silver Cloud II arrived in 1959, basically the same car, but now powered by an all-new (and some say Cadillac-inspired) aluminum, overhead-valve V-8 displacing 6.23 litres and producing "sufficient" horsepower.
This was apparently the Roller that inspired the adman's line: "At 60 miles per hour, the loudest noise in this new Rolls-Royce comes from the electric clock." A Rolls-Royce was also at the time still described as: "The best car in the world."
My own personal favourite quote about a Rolls-Royce was delivered with full British inflection by a PR guy ensconced with me in the back seat at the launch of the latest model of these luxury heavyweights many years ago. "Bob, in one of these you can drive right through a Toyota - without even spilling your drink."
Style and mass may be Rolls trademarks, but so is the engineering. And McKendry is impressed by the level of technology in this almost-50-year-old car.
Its aluminum-cased, four-speed automatic, for instance, was sourced from General Motors. "The automatic in my '60 Corvette is just a two-speed with a cast iron housing." Twin electric fuel pumps mean you'll never be stranded. The distributor has a dial on the side that allows you to set the timing to suit various quality fuels. And the lever shocks' ride-control damping is electrically adjustable.
Perhaps needless to note, both McKendrys are car enthusiasts. Randy, a self-employed business analyst and consultant who designs and supports financial systems for the federal government, recalls always having an interest in cars, and taking note of neat ones on the streets of Kingston, when he visited from his farm home near the city.
As farm kids, he and his brother and sister had to be driven everywhere by their parents, which resulted in a solution that made everybody happy. Each, after obtaining a license, was given a late-model Mustang.
"They wanted us to have reliable cars," says KcKendry.
Yeah, but Mustangs? "My brother had a six-cylinder; I only had a four-cylinder engine. My sister got a GT. It just wasn't fair," he laments.
Despite owning a virtually new car, McKendry enjoyed working on his friends' older models, which in part led him in the mid-1980s to buy his first hobby car, a 1960 Corvette. He thought he'd get to twist wrenches on it, but somewhat to his chagrin, it's proven so reliable since that he has rarely had to.
Buying that first 'Vette did lead to involvement in local car clubs, however, and eventually to his meeting his wife Dawn, a real estate agent, through a mutual Corvette-owning friend. She was a Peugeot diesel-driving Formula One fan who dragged him off to watch Canadian grands prix in Montreal.
Being part of the old-car culture can lead to some interesting experiences, and a McKendry adventure this past summer is worth relating, involving as it did a lorry load of Lotuses and the Jaguar XK 140 Drophead currently sharing garage space with the Corvette and the Silver Cloud.
The couple are part of a group of area enthusiasts who have staged Ottawa's annual British Car Show for the past four years and along the way met a member of the Lotus club, who learned earlier this year that a California enthusiast he'd become friends with had died and left him his
seven-car collection.
Unable to retrieve it himself, McKendry and a friend volunteered. They flew out to Los Angeles and, after beating up the canyon country roads in the new Elise that was part of the collection, which also included the original, two-owner '57 Jag, hauled them and a Penske straight truck full of garage stuff to Ottawa.
"I'd really like the XK 140," admits McKendry, who's currently storing it in his garage and has obviously fallen for the charms of this rare car (74 were built that year).
He is also perhaps succumbing to the Lotus magic. But chances are the McKendrys' true love will remain the family Roller, in which they've toured to Springfield, Mass., and Newport, R.I.'s mansion row, the Maritime provinces and the winding roads of Lake Placid, N.Y., and Stowe, Vt., for Rolls-Royce club gatherings.
"It's a great car to drive," says McKendry, faster and a better handler than you might expect, and every bit as quiet and comfortable as you would expect of a car bearing the Rolls-Royce nameplate on one of the most recognized radiator-shell shapes in the world.

Full text:   At the low end of the business cycle, there's no match for the efficiency of well-planned public transit
Just as Detroit was warned about fuel-inefficient automobiles, so was Toronto alerted to unsustainable sprawl in 1996 by the Golden report.
It has been clear for some time that fuel-inefficient sprawl is an obsolete, unsustainable form of development. As difficult as it is for General Motors to restructure its business, with so-called legacy issues imbedded in the way it does business (gas guzzlers, too many dealerships, union contracts and so on), so it is difficult to restructure the shape of our cities. But it is not impossible, and like GM, we have no option. The sooner we acknowledge the problem, the better our prospects for a sustainable future.
Not only did the Big Three automobile manufacturers fail to recognize the problem of excess gas consumption, they actively resisted the call for fuel-efficient automobiles. So, too, did Mike Harris's Ontario Conservatives ignore the recommendations of the Golden report. Even the most efficient automobiles are nothing in comparison to the fuel efficiency and pollution-reducing characteristics of public transit.
It doesn't end there. Both hard services (utilities) and soft services (schools, universities, clinics, libraries and research facilities) cost far more spread out over hell's half-acre than they do in compact urban configurations. As a result, we're going broke - for every $1 earned in real-estate taxes in low-density areas, the city pays $1.40 to service the land.
Building public transit is not enough. Empty subway cars are expensive to run, too. It should be understood that low-density sprawl does not support public transit:
If it's too far to walk to the station, the result is predictable: Once in the car, the driver keeps going to the final destination. Alternatively, buses are involved and the journey requires more than two transportation modes, ridership falls significantly. Even with one modal change, commuting times can become onerous.
There are answers to these problems. There are ways to begin the necessary transformation.
First, higher densities should be zoned within walking distance of existing public-transit stops. To make public transit affordable, at least 25 units to the acre are necessary. Indeed, no further development should be allowed further than, say, 1,000 metres (a 15-minute walk) of a transit stop. These concentrations will have further benefits: They can support other uses, such as food stores and what's known as convenience retail - dry cleaners, shoe repairs, news vendors - within walking distance of home. Such arrangements break the automobile dependency that shopping malls create in spread-out suburbs.
Second, the utilization of bus flexibility. No expensive rail bed is required for bus service. Buses can serve local routes or longer-haul, express routes. They can have a number of stops in one neighbourhood, then go directly to a more remote destination. Exclusive bus lanes on existing arterial streets, for the longer-haul components of such trips, would enhance their efficiency.
It wouldn't be hard to figure out the demand patterns. Such a system can sustain lower levels of ridership than those required for rail-based transit. Bus transit could even function as an interim arrangement until sufficient density exists for rail.
These are just two of the steps available to begin the process of rendering our cities economically and environmentally sustainable. Once these are begun, there are a host of others to accelerate the change, such as full-cost land pricing that includes the incremental cost of expressways and trunk-line utilities.
The free market has been discredited by the wanton lack of regulation and public-interest intervention. What governments do now with bailouts is possibly a poor, and certainly only a short-term, answer. Governments have to understand the importance of being countercyclical - it's precisely at the low end of the business cycle that they should invest. This is when the best prices are available for construction and other services. As the private sector sheds employees, so the public sector should create them, by investing in future sustainability. Too often, governments do their procurement at the high end of the business cycle, overheating an already hot economy.
Now is the time to consider investing in an infrastructure that not only provides employment but also lays the foundation for future sustainability, and therefore a globally competitive and environmentally responsible economy. If we don't take the opportunity created by the current crisis, suburbs will be like an SUV in the next decade - unwieldy and unwanted.
Jack Diamond was one of five commissioners appointed by the Ontario government to examine the governance, taxation, land use and transportation for the Greater Toronto Area, producing proposals known as the Golden report.

Full text:   Not long ago, booming Ireland was the economic star of Europe. Now its debt-laden people face a crisis that is at least partly home-grown
Tom Cruise (yes, his real name) and his partner Clare bought their dream house a couple of years ago in the Crotanstown Grange estate, an hour's drive south of Dublin. At the time, the list prices for the new luxury houses were rising at EUR100,000 ($160,000) a year, with some going for EUR700,000.
Their house's value soared, then fell hard this year. But it didn't particularly bother them; they had two kids and had no intention of selling.
Their world turned upside down three weeks ago. "We were on holiday in Spain and I wasn't back 20 minutes when my employer told me I had to go," said Mr. Cruise, who was a manager at a local steel fabrication company.
Clare is looking for work but is not optimistic because the hotel industry, where she has experience, is falling apart. "We're still in shock," she said. "I'd take anything at this stage."
Until about a year and a half ago, developments such as Crotanstown Grange promised something akin to the suburban American dream, with neat, trim houses, big kitchens, gardens and parking - features rare or non-existent in central Dublin. But with Ireland having the dubious distinction of being the first country in Western Europe to fall into recession, that dream has since turned into a nightmare for many families.
How did the model economy - the low-tax miracle lauded by economists, neo-conservatives and liberals alike - go from Celtic Tiger to Celtic Catastrophe?
The property market is in genuine crisis throughout Ireland. Yesterday, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, in its Outlook report, predicted the downturn will hit Ireland particularly hard. "Activity is contracting as the severe housing market correction has weakened the wider economy, and the weakness will persist well into 2009," it said.
Everyone - economists, estate agents, bankers, employers - thinks values still have a long way to fall and will make the recession worse. No sector, with the possible exception of the discount grocers, has survived unscathed. The banks are in particularly bad shape.
But Ireland cannot blame outsiders for the entire mess. "This is a home-made crisis made worse by the international crisis," said Constantin Gurdgiev, the research director in Dublin at NCB Stockbrokers and an economist at Trinity College. "This is the most indebted country in the whole European Union."
The economic numbers are grim. The 6-per-cent unemployment rate is expected to rise to 8 per cent next year, Ireland's Economic and Social Research Institute said last week. Mr. Gurdgiev and other economists think low double digits are possible. In the past year, 100,000 jobs have disappeared. By his calculations, total debt held by financial and non-financial institutions, plus credit to private households, is a staggering 265 per cent of GDP.
A few kilometres away from the Cruises, in the more modest Roseberry estate, Martin Ennis, 34, bought a townhouse seven months ago for EUR350,000. Too bad he didn't wait. "Prices are definitely going down," he said. "We've dropped to EUR300,000."
House prices are down 30 per cent from their peak and some real estate professionals said the number is close to 50 per cent in the hardest-hit parts of the county. The Irish Banking Federation says only 27,000 mortgages were written in the third quarter, down from 120,000 in the same quarter a year ago. House construction has utterly collapsed. Ditto car sales, which were down 54 per cent in October. "We are so conditioned to living in the boom years that we're having trouble adapting to this new reality," said Pat Farrell, chief executive officer of the Irish Banking Federation.
While none of these numbers seems large by North American standards, it's important to remember that Ireland has a population of only 4.2 million, about a million less than the Greater Toronto Area.
Greed, easy credit, immigration, massive foreign investment inflows and government spending certainly fuelled the boom. Membership in the European Union and the euro zone added muscle to Paddy Power. But Ireland is learning the hard way that euro zone membership doesn't necessarily work as well on the way down as it did on the way up. Ireland would like far lower interest rates and a devalued currency to cushion its fall. Too bad it has no control over these economic levers. The European Central Bank sets the monetary agenda.
Until the 1960s or so, Ireland was a poor, largely agricultural country. In the 1970s and early 1980s, the country tried to drag itself out of virtual Third World status, but largely failed. Each attempt was overwhelmed by high taxes, the jobs-for-life mentality and absent entrepreneurial flare. Emigration drained talent from the country.
Things began to change in the late 1980s. Wage constraints were negotiated in exchange for tax relief. The tax cuts soon became deeper. The corporate tax rate went from 40 per cent to 12.5 per cent. Personal tax rates were more or less halved. Attracted by the low taxes and an educated work force, foreign companies piled in, including Google and Hewlett-Packard, creating tens of thousands of high-paying jobs. In the past 20 years, Ireland's work force doubled to about two million. In Western Europe, there was no hotter economy.
The tech crash of 2000, and the terrorist attacks of September, 2001, bashed the Irish economy. But new growth drivers in the form of government spending and construction soon came to the rescue. Both went out of control. "The economy became overly reliant on the booming construction sector," said Turlough O'Sullivan, director-general of the Irish Business and Employers Confederation (IBEC). "It was a bubble waiting to happen."
IBEC first warned of the potential dangers of the construction and government spending free-for-all in 2002, to no avail. The per-capita rate of house construction, at its peak, was about 20 times the British rate.
The government funded a staggering array of infrastructure projects while not forgetting to take care of itself. In this decade alone, the number of public servants soared by 80,000 to 370,000.
Easy credit, driven by low euro zone interest rates, took the balloon to bursting point. Banks competed among each other to make mortgages easier to obtain. The 20-per-cent down payment rule went out the window. Many mortgages required no down payment, effectively giving Ireland a U.S.-style subprime market of its own. The number of licensed estate agent companies (also known as auctioneers) doubled to 2,400.
Even at the peak, few Irish thought the boom had gone too far. The optimists felt that Ireland was still catching up with the rest of Western Europe. Immigration, rising employment and salaries would keep the good times rolling. "We felt we were not the typical growth economy heading towards a bubble," said Alan Cooke, the CEO of the Irish Auctioneers & Valuers Institute.
In truth, the Irish property market peaked in 2006, more than a year before the U.S. subprime mortgage mess ushered in the global financial crisis. Worse, there is a sense neither the Irish government, with its widening deficit, nor the European Union can do much to help. "The ECB rates were high and designed to placate German fears of inflation," said Mr. Gurdgiev, the Trinity College economist. "Now they're too high for Ireland."
In central Dublin itself, the streets are still lively but the signs of the downturn are ubiquitous. There is more than a whiff of Iceland in Ireland.
Some streets are cluttered with "For Sale" and "Price Reduced" signs. The number of idle taxis is stunning.
The construction of a 120-metre tower in Dublin's docklands that was to house U2's rock studio was just put on hold. Hotels are struggling. A new, four-star hotel called the Louis Fitzgerald, at the south end of the city, advertises rooms at EUR10 a pop. The Christmas sales have begun.
Back in Crotanstown Grange, Tom and Clare Cruise are devising a backup plan in case they can't find work. They like the idea of moving to Canada or Australia, where they imagine jobs are more plentiful, but they fear the imploding Irish real estate market might make that impossible. "People can't sell their houses now, no matter how low they go," Mr. Cruise said.
Irish statistics aren't smiling
CONSUMERS
Europe's retail sales are slow,
but Ireland's are slower
RETAIL SALES (JULY)
Ireland: -5 per cent
Euro zone: -1.8 per cent
Ireland has little room to cut sales tax, Irish Prime Minister Brian Cowen said this week, despite fears from retailers that the U.K.'s VAT cut could drive more Irish shoppers to neighbouring Northern Ireland.
His comments come as concerns grow about the number of Irish shoppers who head over the border to buy their goods and who are already taking advantage of the sterling's recent weakness against the euro. "A small economy doesn't have as much room for manoeuvre as a large economy in that respect," Mr. Cowen said.
JOBS
Ireland's low corporate tax rate made it a magnet for global companies and European workers. But as the jobless rate rises, people are leaving. The net migratory outflow in 2009 is expected to be 30,000.
LABOUR FORCE
by occupation:
Agriculture: 6 per cent
Industry: 27 per cent
Services: 67 per cent.
THE LOOK AHEAD
Although a severe housing market correction has weakened the economy, the OECD says growth will recover in 2010 as the housing construction cycle bottoms out and the financial turmoil wanes.

Full text:   Hosting the do? Here's what you do
We know what you're thinking. Don't. Cancelling that holiday party because the economy has soured won't save you much money, and it will send the message: We're worried, and you should be too. But now, more than ever, you want to do the bash right.
Three-quarters of businesses threw holiday parties last year, though a relative few did the job well. The legend of the boozy office soiree persists--a bottle opened, a button unbuttoned, the inevitable deposition to follow. But more common is the dud scenario, a fete so lame that its best intentions (morale boost, staff retention) are lost on its captive guests. To wit: Four in five Canadian workers consider office parties a "chore" to attend.
What's an employer to do? For starters, get the fundamentals right.
When do I start planning? What, you haven't started yet? You're running very late. October is good; September is better. The trendiest venues book early, and once the holiday season begins, there's less room to negotiate the costs.
How much do I spend? There are too many variables for a rule of thumb. But to rein in costs, eliminate hors d'oeuvres and restrict alcohol consumption--one drink ticket instead of two; serve beer and wine but forgo liquor. You might also consider postponing the date from December to January: Venues are easier (and cheaper) to book then, plus your guests get a respite from the post-holiday blahs.
Who should be invited? Staff is a given. Spouses, partners and families--it depends. The presence of loved ones will foster employees' best behaviour (sobriety, fidelity), but will inhibit socializing--no one ignores their date to chat up Herb in accounting. Some companies opt to include clients as well. "People are using the holidays as an opportunity to lump together a few occasions," says Donna Seidman, a Montreal event planner. Keep in mind that the more strangers present, the smaller the talk. One tip: Schedule time for employees to party together before outsiders join in.
Should I hire a planner? If you want something simple (prix fixe at a favourite restaurant), do-it-yourself may be the route to go. Rachel Johns of Greenstone Productions outside Vancouver, however, argues that hiring a professional ups your odds of hosting a memorable party, "as opposed to spending $5,000 on an event that everyone dreads." Planners get much of their business from referrals, so start by asking peers for recommendations. Pricing structures vary: Experienced planners charge flat project fees; newcomers tend to have hourly rates.
When should I hold the party? More than 40% of businesses that threw holiday parties last year scheduled them for daytime hours. Seidman says weekend afternoon parties typically happen when companies want to involve employees' children. Otherwise, Thursday evenings are the recommended time. For one thing, having to work the following morning tends to slow the march to the bar (though you will likely still see a spike in people calling in sick or arriving late). After hours on Wednesdays is a decent second choice, but beware the weekend: Staff won't appreciate the intrusion into their personal time.
Where should I hold it? Three-quarters of company holiday parties happen offsite. Restaurants are a small business's best friend: food, beverages and decor are provided; there's often an audiovisual set-up and a dance floor. Be mindful, though, of mandatory fees. Many restaurants, and hotels in particular, insist on minimum charges for food and beverages. Rachel Johns suggests getting creative. "If you're not going to spend a ton of money on flashy entertainment, a cool venue goes a lot further than a stuffy hotel room with ugly carpet." Her company has hosted events in a Vancouver hair salon and a vintage printing shop. But if you're asking the business to shut its doors to others, expect to pay anywhere from $1,000 to $7,000 in venue fees.
What about entertainment? A theme is optional, but may kick your event into a higher fun bracket. And live entertainment can offer a welcome change in conversation from next year's sales projections. "Small companies, where everyone knows each other, just want downtime to chill together," says Donna Seidman, but in bigger organizations, you want to get staff from various departments talking. Katherine Parris of Toronto's Events by Parris has hired Egyptian belly dancers, Arabic bands and DJs who spin Asian records. She's partial to faux casino parties where guests bet funny money on roulette and blackjack. Meanwhile, Johns reports Vancouver has Olympic fever. Companies are clamouring for athletic-themed events, including demonstrations of prowess. Corporations have cornered the market on well-known Olympians, but small businesses can feature up-and-comers, she says.
How do I get good party flow? Offer a variety of seating--perhaps a section of lounge chairs, a section of tables and chairs, some bar chairs. Encourage guests to mingle by leaving open space between eating areas. Seidman has stirred things up by hiring magicians to wander through the crowd. Most importantly, keep yourself in motion--guests will look to their host for an example. Walk tall and carry a swizzle stick.

SO YOU THINK YOU CAN DANCE?
There's a good chance you're wrong. Xavi Monreal teaches hip hop and house dancing at London's esteemed Pineapple Dance Studios. His system for boogying at office parties can save you career-long embarrassment.
1.
Find the song's beat before you start dancing. Then, follow the music, not the words.
2.
Avoid "narrative dancing" --you are not ironing shirts, typing e-mail or filing reports.
3.
Make a basic side-to-side step your foundation. Jab your feet forward, backward or diagonally (as if on a chessboard) to heat things up, but always return to the centre.
4.
Let your arms swing at waist height
Do not point, clap or finger-snap.
5.
Once you're feeling comfortable, throw in a unique movement or two. Go ahead and patrol the dance floor. You're ready.

THEY BOOZE, YOU LOSE
In 1994, an Ontario receptionist got drunk at her real estate office's holiday party, which had an open, unsupervised bar
When the afternoon event ended, she continued drinking with co-workers at a nearby pub
Hours later, the woman, alone at the wheel, was severely injured in a car crash. In 2002, a judge ordered her employer and the pub to pay $300,000 in personal damages and liability fees. The ruling was overturned on appeal, but the fact stands: What and how much your employees drink can hurt you. In For Better or for Worse: A Practical Guide to Canadian Employment Law , Randall Scott Echlin and Christine Thomlinson offer these tips for covering your assets:
Send the message that alcohol consumption is a personal choice, making sure no employee at the event feels pressured to drink.
Provide safe transportation home (designated drivers or complimentary taxi chits).
Forget the self-service bar
Only designated servers should be allowed to pour alcohol.
Ensure that all servers are 18 years of age or older and know how to spot intoxicated individuals.
Limit the number of drink tickets per employee.
Serve food as well as alcohol.
Stop serving booze well before the end of the event, but continue serving other beverages, particularly coffee.

BACK OFFICE
WHAT'S YOUR PARTY CULTURE?
Mary Mulligan has been a prominent event planner since the mid-'90s. Before that, she spent 20 years as manager of special events at the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto. We asked her to suggest holiday party schemes for three very different fictitious small businesses.
"The annual office party starts along about noon on December 24 and ends two or three months later, depending how long it takes the boss to find out who set fire to his wastebasket, threw the water cooler out of the window, and betrayed Miss O'Malley in the men's washroom."
--American humorist Corey Ford, 1951
TRADITIONAL
Family-owned manufacturing company outside Windsor, Ontario, with 100 employees
VENUE The plant floor. "I've done that before. Just make sure they clean it first."
MENU No sit-down dinner. Hire caterers and party suppliers to cart in food, drinks and decor. "I'd give [the client] a stand-up, heavy-duty hors d'oeuvres party right after work."
THEME Dress up the factory with holiday decorations. Christmas iconography is too specific in these multicultural times, but who's offended by artificial snowflakes?
BEWARE Transportation costs. Caterers charge delivery fees and mileage, so bringing them from downtown far into the suburbs can eat up the savings of hosting the party on site.
URBAN HIP
A downtown Vancouver new media company with a staff of 25
VENUE Think bright lights, big sound system. "That group wants to be entertained." Take the staff to a place where they can be loud and active.
MENU Drinks and hors d'oeuvres.
THEME Focus on laser tag, billiards, go-karts or another high-energy activity. Keep the party in constant motion.
BEWARE The temptation to host the small-guest-list event at a private residence. While you fret about the furniture, the staff will be yawning.
BUTTONED-UP
A financial advisory partnership with 50 staffers in downtown Toronto
VENUE The top floor of Bistro 990, a tony Bay Street restaurant.
MENU Sit-down meal with guests' choice of individual entree, and unlimited alcohol.
THEME Set a festive tone by adding green or red accents to the room. Hire a trio to play classical music during dinner, then bring in some livelier performers after the meal.
BEWARE The urge to encourage staffers to dance.

How to greenwash your bash
Buy carbon offsets Plug the values for travel, electricity and heating fuel use (venue managers can help with estimates) into Carbonzero.ca's online calculator and purchase offsets from the site. Feel good knowing the company will invest your money in clean energy technologies.
Eat local Hire a green caterer, such as Toronto's En Ville Event Design and Catering, which limits the use of disposable items, buys mainly from local food and alcohol providers, and requires carbon offsets for its delivery fleet. Better still, keep the fare simple and healthy. Skip cookies and chips; opt for fruit.
Book an eco-friendly site Some new venues have made green a business model. At the Richmond in downtown Toronto, everything from the bamboo floors to a strict no-water-bottle policy testify to its eco bona-fides. But even the likes of Toronto's Metro Convention Centre boast of green initiatives, including a roof garden, computer recycling and "zero-waste events."
Go leafy At the very least, invest in some flora. A capable event planner should be able to summon potted trees on demand, year round. "They give off all that beautiful oxygen and make the room feel very fresh," says Donna Seidman of Montreal's Eventive.

Full text:   A chance to provide cutting-edge marketing for the restoration of Vancouver's Hotel Georgia helps DreamLife break ground in the luxury real estate market
When Robert Kenfield launched DreamLife Design Inc. in 2005, he looked for a way to set his Vancouver company apart from the competition. At the time, real estate visualization was a relatively young and largely fragmented industry.
Most of the players were focused on only one part of the visualization experience - either the 3-D images, the animation or the software itself. Mr. Kenfield, who has a background in environmental design and architecture, wanted to set up a studio that could deliver all three of these services.
DreamLife uses architectural drawings to create 3-D renderings of residential or commercial real estate developments. These images can be animated to produce videos for viewing on the Web or TV, or can be combined with interactive software so that prospective buyers can "experience" the space on a computer screen.
Visualization tools have elevated real estate marketing to new, virtual dimensions. Condo developers, for example, can now invite clients to interactive showrooms where the buyers can "walk through" their acquisition (altering colour schemes and kitchen cabinetry as they go) before the shovels are even in the ground.
Mr. Kenfield brought his company along slowly, gradually taking on more complex projects and perfecting the technology. Within two years, the 12-person company was juggling about a dozen projects at a time, mostly for local residential developers and marketers, including Sotheby's International Realty Canada.
These projects were all small to medium-sized, however. "I knew we needed a recognizable name to catapult us to the next level," he says.
When Sotheby's connected Mr. Kenfield with Vancouver-based developer Delta Group in early 2007, he saw the opportunity he'd been waiting for: a contract to provide visualization services for the residential portion of the $400-million restoration of the Hotel Georgia. "We knew it was a signature project that was going to help us grow our company," he says.
After making his pitch over the course of a few meetings, Mr. Kenfield submitted his bid, along with a handful of other companies, including the project's architect, and waited. The architect had the advantage of already being close to the project, but they were only interested in handling the renderings, which meant Delta would still have had to hire different suppliers to do the animation work and integrate the presentation into one interactive software package.
"It took a little bit of convincing that our approach was the right one," says Mr. Kenfield, explaining that Delta was initially overwhelmed by DreamLife's one-stop approach. In the end, however, the integrated solution won out, and DreamLife was awarded what was then its biggest (Mr. Kenfield will only say it was worth three times the value of any of their previous jobs) and most complex project.
The Hotel Georgia's 48-storey residential tower included 12 different units with a choice of two colour schemes, and DreamLife's job was to bring every one of these options to life. "We're talking over 100 renderings and 13 animations and individual short films," Mr. Kenfield says. Until then, a typical DreamLife project had involved only about 20 to 40 still images. Another challenge was the time frame: The job had to be completed in three months. "This was the largest project we'd ever undertaken, it had to be done in the shortest amount of time, and it required the greatest amount of detail and creativity," he says.
Failure to meet the client's expectations on this job would be a huge setback to DreamLife's local reputation, which Mr. Kenfield had worked hard to establish. "You don't want to overpromise and underdeliver," he says. "That would hurt our brand."
Meeting Delta's deadline "put our systems to the test," he says, explaining that DreamLife didn't have to shelve any of its 12 or so other projects, but instead focused on the individual phases of each job. "Let's say half our projects were in stage one and the others were in stage two, which allowed different people to work on different phases. If they'd all been in the same phase at the same time, it would have been a problem."
Before making his bid to Delta, Mr. Kenfield had consulted with his designers and production team about their ability to manage the workload. "I knew we could deliver on time and also create a project that would be incredibly glamorous for the client."
Mr. Kenfield and several of his staff (who include architects, graphic designers, interactive Web designers and a video production crew) clocked 80-hour weeks to get the job done on time. "This technology is becoming more and more widespread," Mr. Kenfield says. "But the level to which Hotel Georgia has it is at the top of the world. There are very few projects that have this level of visualization that give you such a complete understanding of the project."
After completing the Hotel Georgia project in June, DreamLife Design secured an even bigger and more complex job with the Ritz Carlton Montreal, which they completed in October. "Hotel Georgia showed marketers and developers what we are capable of producing," he says. "It's just an awesome project." Mr. Kenfield has since started discussions with major developers in Dubai and Singapore. "Hotel Georgia opened my eyes to the appetite that exists for our type of services," he says.
DreamLife's cash flow is in good shape, too. Mr. Kenfield has doubled his staff to 25 since completing the Hotel Georgia job. And he has recently established a Toronto office that he hopes will serve as a gateway to more projects in Eastern Canada and the U.S. East Coast.
This was the track Mr. Kenfield wanted DreamLife to be on all along. "I believe we would have gotten to this point without Hotel Georgia," he says. "This just got us there faster."

SNAPSHOT
The vitals
Robert Kenfield launched Vancouver-based DreamLife Design, a real estate visualization company, in 2005. Because of DreamLife's integrated approach, Mr. Kenfield employs about 25 architects, Web designers, graphic designers and a video production crew, in addition to staff on the business development side.
The key decision
"Definitely our relationship with Sotheby's [International Realty] was central to this," Mr. Kenfield says. Sotheby's had contracted DreamLife to provide real estate visualization services on about a dozen small projects, and subsequently recommended Mr. Kenfield's firm for the Hotel Georgia job - which just goes to show that it pays off to apply high standards to every job, no matter how big or small.
The oversight
At the end of each project, DreamLife meets with its clients to gain insights on improving its processes. "In hindsight, we could have taken a few areas in [the Hotel Georgia] project to the next level," Mr. Kenfield says. "The most important thing would be getting involved much earlier in the marketing and sales process by being part of the design process for the presentation centre," he says. DreamLife's hardware showcases its visuals in the sales centres, and "it could have been more seamless."
The next steps
Mr. Kenfield's immediate goal is to secure a high-profile project in Toronto, as well as more projects throughout Eastern Canada and the United States. "Toronto is an amazing hub for conducting business in Montreal, New York and other eastern cities," he says.
The intriguing idea
DreamLife Design didn't invent real estate visualization, but Mr. Kenfield's approach has some unique qualities. When he launched DreamLife, most of the competition focused on one part of the process - either the 3-D renderings, the animation or the interactive software. To give DreamLife a competitive advantage, Mr. Kenfield combined all three services under one roof. "If someone provides you with a rendering, what are you going to do with it?" he says. "If they provide you with a film, where is it going to go? We wanted to give developers the full-service solution."
The market
The number of multi-tenant residential buildings being constructed in Canada has risen steadily over the years. During the first three quarters of 2008, 119,000 units were under construction in Canada, compared to 106,800 and 98,700 in the same periods of 2007 and 2004, respectively (according to Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp.).

Full text:   Many buildings are being demolished to avoid steep taxes, leaving neighbourhoods looking bombed and hollowed out
In the real-estate industry, they're calling it "bombsite Britain."
You can see its effects in a windswept lot in west London, where a mountain of red bricks and broken timber sits. Until recently it was a historic pub called the Lightning, but its owner, unable to find a tenant to get the beer taps flowing again, has demolished it to avoid paying steep property taxes on an empty building.
Or at the other end of London, where an enormous, 35-year-old public-housing complex is in the midst of a total demolition, and maybe a permanent one. The company hired by the government to replace the 2,000 homes with a more attractive development was struck by the economic crisis and may not be able to find financing to finish construction. Officials say the site is likely to become a field, its tenants seeking homes.
Or in the middle of downtown Leeds, where construction of a block-wide office building has ground to a halt, probably permanently, as its builder has failed to find commercial tenants or financiers for the project. The dreary unfinished foundation has helped give a gap-toothed expression to the downtown core.
To many observers, Britain's urban areas are beginning to resemble the years of the Blitz.
But this time, the empty lots are being caused not by bombs but by a freak combination of disasters in the financial system, the real-estate market and the tax code that have turned one of the world's largest real-estate booms into a recipe for derelict and abandoned properties.
"We now have almost a million houses that are abandoned, even though there's a housing shortage, and the economy is not providing any way to match them with occupants, so a good proportion might be slated for demolition," said David Ireland, chairman of the Empty Homes Agency, a housing charity.
Four in five of those houses were owned by private individuals, often working-class Britons who took advantage of easy credit rules to withdraw equity from their homes and use it to put down payments on second "buy-to-let" houses for rental income. The economic downturn created a domino effect where many people have lost both of their houses in a storm of foreclosures and evictions.
A lot more have simply not been sold because British banks, many of which are still struggling to rid themselves of credit risk after a major government bailout, are now wary of giving mortgages to consumers at any rate. And a spiralling unemployment crisis is making people wary of putting their money down on a house they may be unable to afford.
This has left developers, who built like mad during the boom, stuck with thousands of properties they can't sell.
You can see that happening on the edge of Birmingham, where a year-old subdivision of handsome red-brick houses, Nether Hall Park, has streets mysteriously devoid of cars or pedestrians. The handful of people who bought houses there a year ago for $800,000 now say they have to walk past blocks of empty houses on the market for half that price before they can find a single neighbour. They wonder if the developer will soon turn them into fields.
Compounding the huge glut of empty homes and business offices is a tax system that requires owners to pay property tax on empty buildings based on their size, with only a six-month grace period to find tenants. This provides an economic incentive to demolish buildings.
"This is like putting income tax on the unemployed ... some of our members are taking desperate measures and actually knocking down buildings before they've reached the end of [their] useful life," said Liz Peace of the British Property Federation, which represents builders. "Developers who might be rebuilding city centres just won't do it now, because they don't want to be in a situation where they can't find a tenant and have to pay the tax, and then have to destroy the building."
Such demolitions have become commonplace. On the outskirts of Newcastle this month, an entire industrial park of 116,000 square feet was demolished because its owners couldn't find enough tenants to compensate for a property-tax bill of $240,000 a year.
On top of that, many British local governments have given the redevelopment of huge public-housing projects and downtown units to private developers in exchange for the right to build for-profit condominiums.
As the condo market has disappeared and mortgage lending has shrunk 40 per cent, these companies have lost their sources of financing, and there is a real possibility that huge stretches of downtown cores will be unbuilt and left as half-demolished stretches of wasteland.
"This is really a set of circumstances that is unique to Britain, and it is creating a really serious waste of valuable property," Mr. Ireland said.
Many property builders are simply unable to build anything because they lack funds. Taylor Wimpey, Britain's biggest builder, has seen its value collapse from $11.4-billion last year to $210-million this month. Most other builders have seen similar falls.
Britain is in the midst of a major housing shortage, with the government estimating that 400,000 extra houses will need to be built to fill existing demand. Of the million empty houses, at least 300,000 are private units that have been empty for more than six months and will probably never be able to fill that demand.
As a result, one of the few growth areas in the British economy has been in the field of property guardians: People, often young adventure-seeking men from Australia and South Africa, who are paid a small sum to live in empty buildings and protect them from being ransacked, stripped, vandalized or squatted.
Those companies are now desperately running advertisements seeking young people willing to live in office buildings, housing projects and stately homes that can't seem to find buyers in today's market. It used to be a short-term job to guard a building between tenants, but now it seems to have become a form of palliative care - keeping a building warm until it becomes another hole in the gap-toothed face of the city.

Full text:   A disgruntled former aide to Scarborough City Councillor Ron Moeser has alleged that onetime mayoral candidate Tom Jakobek paid about $30,000 in undisclosed help for Mr. Moeser's 2006 election campaign.
The allegations, which have not been proven in court, are contained in an affidavit filed by Bruce Baker - whom Mr. Moeser dismissed in November of 2007 - in a lawsuit against Mr. Jakobek over a disputed development deal.
Mr. Moeser said in an interview that the allegations are "ridiculous" and "totally absurd," noting that they emerged only after he dismissed Mr. Baker, whom he said failed to tell him of his and Mr. Jakobek's involvement in development applications in his ward.
"Why would I let this guy go if this thing were true?" Mr. Moeser said of the allegations, acknowledging that Mr. Baker worked on his 2006 campaign before he hired him to work in his office after the election.
In the court document, Mr. Baker, who has worked as a real-estate agent, claims that Mr. Jakobek gave him $50,000, with about $20,000 used to pay tenants who were vacating a property and most of the rest "to pay expenses related to the campaign of counsellor [sic] Ron Moeser."
In a transcript of a cross-examination by Harvey Dorsey, a lawyer for Mr. Jakobek, Mr. Baker alleges that the money was received both in cash and in cheques cashed at Money Mart, and was used to buy wooden stakes for election signs and tools, and to pay about 14 people to hammer in election signs, hand out flyers and pull the vote in Mr. Moeser's ward on election day.
In the transcript, filed with the lawsuit's other documents, Mr. Baker alleges that "Mr. Moeser falsified his election statement and declared that he spent $450 on wood ... when in fact he didn't."
Mr. Moeser said in an interview that Mr. Baker himself provided him with the $450 receipt for the wood, which was included in his election filing, and denied any wrongdoing.
Under the Municipal Elections Act, candidates must declare election expenses and observe a spending limit, which in Mr. Moeser's ward in 2006 was $32,920.90.
According to his financial filing, Mr. Moeser, a long-time local politician in Scarborough, spent $30,599.90 in his 2006 campaign and raised just over $29,135 - most of it in an allowable unlimited donation from his wife, Heather, of $23,750.
Mr. Baker said in an interview that his lawsuit against Mr. Jakobek, in which he alleged he had been shortchanged in a development deal and had demanded $600,000, was to be settled.
In his statement of defence, Mr. Jakobek - who was deemed likely to have accepted a $25,000 payoff in the Bellamy report on the city's MFP computer-leasing scandal - denied Mr. Baker's allegations.
Reached by phone at his home last night, Mr. Jakobek declined to comment.

Full text:   Canada's booming wine industry is fuelling investments in everything from tourism to housing developments
When former Ontario cabinet minister and ex-college president Richard Johnston and his wife Vida Zalnieriunas moved to Prince Edward County, a bucolic island known for its sand dunes and former glory days as a tomato cannery at the eastern end of Lake Ontario, they planned to buy a 50-acre farm.
That's not how it worked out. In the 15 years since buying their property - 215 acres of corn and soybeans - they became boutique wine-makers, setting aside 20 acres to plant high-quality vinifera grapes in 1999.
As they prepare to celebrate the 10th anniversary of By Chadsey's Cairn next year, the couple find themselves part of a stunning transformation of a long-depressed agricultural area into a fast-growing wine region that has made Prince Edward County a destination for top chefs, tourists and investors in the past five years.
"Now all of a sudden we have been discovered," Mr. Johnston says.
It's a trend playing out in wine-growing regions across Canada, with an explosion in the number of wineries - many of them linked to investments in restaurants, artisan food shops, hotels, golf courses and high-end housing. Their target market is aging baby boomers with the time and, even in the current downturn, the disposable income, to savour the romance of wine.
"The wine becomes a catalyst," says Peter Gamble, a top consultant who advises startup wineries in Ontario, Nova Scotia, British Columbia and internationally. "It is a life-style indicator and the kind of thing that works with a lot of upscale projects."
For example, near Penticton, B.C., Greata Ranch is a working 40-acre winery owned by Cedar Creek Wineries that has teamed up with Concord Pacific Group to develop another 40 acres for 400 units of town homes and villas on the shores of Lake Okanagan. Near Vernon, B.C., a new resort community by Okanagan Hills Development Corp. features single-family homes alongside a winery set to open next year.
In Niagara Falls, Ont., where the long-established industry has built an international reputation for ice wines, a winery named for Canadian golf star Mike Weir aims to open in 2010 on a parcel of land leased from the Niagara Parks Commission, alongside an existing golf course.
In Nova Scotia, whose Annapolis Valley is touted by some as Canada's next major wine region, the provincial winery association predicts the number of wineries will double to 20 from 10 at present by 2020, with current sales expected to triple to $24-million over the same period.
"It's the 'perfect storm,' in a good way," says Seaton McLean, president of Ontario's Prince Edward County Winegrowers Association, of the recent convergence of wine, agriculture and tourism.
Working with his group is a county development officer, a federal rural economic development office and Taste the County, a marketing effort financed in part by local businesses. Through joint promotional efforts such as Wassail, being held this weekend and next to mark the end of the harvest, the wineries work with local food producers, bed and breakfasts and artists to raise the profile of the largely rural county. In the process, they have been able to extend a summer-only tourist season to five months of the year, with wine lovers from Quebec an unexpected bonus.
The area's grape-growing and wine industry received all-important provincial government recognition as a Designated Viticultural Area in 2006; it has 16 wineries today, up from only one in 2001, with nine more expected to open next year.
"The wine industry has been a magnet for non-wine investment in real estate, new businesses in culinary and agriculture and tourism," says Dan Taylor, the county's economic development officer. He points to the decision of local winery Huff Estates to build a 21-room inn and proposed art gallery as indicative of efforts to coax visitors to come, stay longer and spend more.
A recent study by KPMG for the 84-member Wine Council of Ontario estimates the province's wine and grape-growing industry generated $529-million in economic activity in 2007, up from $202-million a decade ago.
In Nova Scotia, where the wine industry is expected to generate $160-million in economic impact by 2020, the emphasis is on synergies between vineyards, agriculture and tourism.
"We offer great wines, but we offer the whole experience," says Janice Ruddock, managing director of the Winery Association of Nova Scotia and executive director of Taste of Nova Scotia.
Along with wine-country tour packages, festivals and other tourism marketing, cruise-ship stopovers in Halifax allow for day trips to the Annapolis Valley vineyards. "When you are getting off a cruise, you want an experience," Ms. Ruddock says. "It is adding to the dynamic of Nova Scotia."
The same pattern is unfolding on an even bigger scale in British Columbia, with 171 wineries today, up from 17 in 1990, the post-free trade birth of the vinifera grape industry there.
"People's interest in wine has continued to grow and it is not just about what is in the glass; it's how did it get there," says wine consultant Harry McWatters, a 40-year veteran of the B.C. wine industry and a founder of Sumac Ridge Winery.
Wineries are increasingly aiming to create a complete experience for the consumer, be it the lure of a top chef at a vineyard restaurant that features locally grown food or the chance to live in a house or condo with a view of the vines.
So far, the economic downturn has done little to scare off investors, says B.C. Wine Institute chairman Scott Adams, noting that prime vineyard land fetches more than $100,000 an acre in the province. "There is certainly room to expand and we expect to see continued growth over the next five to 10 years," he says.
The key to future success, say industry leaders, is Canadian-based research - on the best grapes for a short growing season in a cool climate and on questions about changing consumer tastes.
"When I started 34 years ago, I was told it was too cold to buy European grapes," recalls industry icon Donald Ziraldo, a co-founder of Inniskillin Wines who, having sold in 2006, now focuses on promoting a national research agenda.
"I learned through trial and error and that's very expensive," says Mr. Ziraldo, chairman of Ontario's Vineland Research and Innovation Centre and chairman of the National Grape and Wine Strategy Committee. "It's better to do it in research."
Amid rising costs, growing international competition and a domestic market still dominated by imports, Canadian wineries look to research to boost the value-added of a grape. "As you go up the premium ladder with wine, you need more and more to go back to the terroir," says Mr. Ziraldo, referring to the soil, sun and growing conditions that define wine regions.
Meanwhile, as Mr. Johnston prepares for Wassail visitors this weekend, he wryly observes that for all the perceived romance of wine-making, it is a physically and financially draining business with little hope of a quick profit.
"This is something you should do young and with money," jokes the 62-year-old. "I missed out on both."

Full text:   The global recession touched down in Toronto when construction of a highly anticipated downtown research centre came to a sudden halt this week.
"The world is plunging into what could be a very deep recession so we're taking prudent measures to suspend construction," said John Cunningham of California-based Alexandria Real Estate Equities, which until this week was building a 20-storey building on the southeast corner of College Street and University Avenue as part of the MaRS Discovery District, a non-profit "innovation centre" established to encourage high-tech startups.
A speculative venture that was going ahead without government funding, the MaRS expansion is not the only such victim of the credit crunch. Last week, Alexandria suspended construction of two similar buildings at San Francisco's Mission Bay biotech complex and another at New York's East River Science Park.
"There's no one market that is different from another," Mr. Cunningham said. "It's a global situation."
But the Toronto building will go ahead when conditions improve, Mr. Cunningham insisted. "It's as simple as a temporary suspension in construction," he said. "We're totally committed to MaRS, we have nothing but the strongest feelings for Toronto and think it's a fantastic market."
The suspension is disappointing but not surprising, according to Ilse Treurnicht, MaRS CEO. "MaRS is a magnifying glass of what is going on in the global economy," she said. "We are clearly dealing with an unprecedented and unpredictable set of global circumstances."
As a result, Ms. Treurnicht said, it is impossible to anticipate when construction of the new building might begin again. But in the meantime, she insisted, MaRS continues to thrive.
"Although we're very excited about watching a building go up it doesn't change anything we do," she said. "We're not even taking a breath. We're marching ahead."
MaRS, established originally to foster innovation in the health sciences, currently accommodates 70 tenants in a variety of industries, including 30 in its incubator program. It serves even more companies that are not located in the complex, according to Ms. Treurnicht.
"We have a full building and in fact we're seeing growth in our waiting list, particularly with the smaller companies," she said.
Even so, some established tenants are feeling the crunch. "It's a very cash-dependent sector," said Tony Cruz, CEO of MaRS tenant Transition Therapeutics Inc., a biotech firm that has seen its stock price plummet in recent weeks. "We're dependent on investors and when the cash disappears from the market it really puts a lot of pressure on companies."
Building a business culture that is capable of sustaining a local biotech industry will take much more than new buildings, according to Mr. Cruz. "That takes a lot more focus."
The current "pause" will give MaRS the opportunity to develop a new strategy for implementing its plans, according to Ms. Treurnicht. Without asking for a bailout, she held out hope for future government partnerships.
"If anything, the global situation has made the work of MaRS more important," she said. "Building the next generation of knowledge-based businesses is our opportunity to take control of our future economic destiny. The work of MaRS is absolutely critical in terms of reinventing not only Toronto but Ontario's economy."

Full text: Rather than compete in a limited market, two universities join forces in a win-win program for business leaders
The new McGill-HEC Montreal EMBA, in many ways, resembles a Montreal conversation. Just as the bilingual francophone and anglophone will jump from one language to the other, the new joint program between McGill University and the école des Hautes études Commerciales de Montreal will provide a lecture in French one day, a guest speaker in English another, and discussions, projects and exams in the language in which the student or professor feels more comfortable.
One of the program's two academic directors, HEC's Louis Hebert, had been lecturing at the Richard Ivey School of Business when he was approached by HEC Montreal to manage an EMBA program. He wanted the venture to reflect Montreal society and to do that, he said "bilingualism was a must," adding that a two-language program reflects the city's life.
It was the relatively small international market for EMBA programs that convinced Dr. Hebert in 2003 that his school needed to team up with McGill's Desautel Faculty of Management.
"There were too many risks that we would end up as two competitors," said Dr. Hebert, who said local recruitment would also be at risk, since both schools keep in contact with many of the same companies from where students can be drawn.
For HEC Montreal, a joint program with the anglophone university would offer them access to the wider English-speaking market and allow them to use the teachings of internationally known management expert Henry Mintzberg. McGill, through its new affiliation with HEC, would be more in touch with the francophone business sector and have access to an institution that counts 260 faculty members, a giant when compared to its 60 professors.
Dr. Hebert, who actually wrote his thesis on joint ventures in the corporate sector, saw that the mismatches in the two institutions would have to be smoothed out. HEC Montreal is a self-standing institution with a Université de Montreal affiliation, while Desautel is essentially a faculty within a university.
In 2004, senior administrators, including the dean of Desautel, were quickly on board and by 2005 a memorandum of understanding was signed and, then, this September the first classes began.
Professors and students must be comfortable in both English and French, and courses are taught usually in the mother tongue of the professor.
For Jan Schoningh and Michèle Meier, two students enrolled in this debut year of the 15-month program, being able to speak in the language in which they're most comfortable makes perfect sense. Ms. Meier says it's very freeing, while Mr. Schoningh calls the idea of a bilingual EMBA "very open-minded."
McGill's Alain Pinsonneault, the program's other academic director, appropriately enough for his role in this two-university program, earned an MSc degree from HEC and taught there from 1990-99 before moving to McGill. The joint program gives students that same type of dual affiliation, offering diploma seals from both McGill and HEC Montreal.
The average age of the students is 42, with work experience averaging 18 years. Half the 36 enrolled students hold the role of VP in their organizations.
That type of experience is something that Mr. Schöningh appreciates and what helped draw the former hotel manager and now vice-president of development at real estate company Homburg Canada Inc. to the program.
"In a classroom with people who are 27 or 28 years old, even if they're super smart, it does not replace 10 to 15 years of management experience."
The fees for the program are $65,000, prompting the 43-year-old Mr. Schoningh to remark that some men who hit middle age often buy a sports car, while he bought himself time in an EMBA program. Joking aside, he says he looked long and hard for something that would give him more depth than the summer programs in which he had previously enrolled and put him in the same room with people who had real-life business experiences.
The program offers four-day modules every month, from Thursday to Sunday, with two residential modules of 7 and 10 days. The second residential module takes place abroad in either Latin America or Asia.
Ms. Meier, 37, general manager of corporate affairs at Groupe Aeroplan, calls the monthly four-day modules a "brilliant compromise" since she could not imagine herself finding the time to tackle a four-year degree.
"It's a way to find a balance between family, work and school."
Participation is key. Students must bring real work issues into class and must apply what they learn in the "real world" to implement change in the workplace. That means students bring their experience to class and then bring their lessons to work.
One of the ways that's done is through shadowing. Students pair off and shadow each other during five-day visits to each other's workplace. It is a two-fold exercise in which participants get feedback from their observer, and observers reflect on themselves as they observe.
The program uses faculty from both McGill and HEC Montreal as well as guest lecturers, one recent one being Power Corporation's Paul Desmarais.

DEGREES CAN BE BI-NATIONAL, TOO
While its bilingual nature makes the McGill - HEC Montreal EMBA unique, it's not the only joint Executive MBA program in the country. Three others in Canada not only bring two or more universities together, they also bring two or more countries together.
NYU Stern-LSE-HEC Paris
New York University Leonard N. Stern School of Business, the London School of Economics and Political Science and the HEC School of Management Paris teamed up in 2000 to create the TRIUM Global Executive MBA. Aimed at senior executives, it combines business with socioeconomic and political context. TRIUM students participate in six intensive modules, held at NYU Stern, LSE and HEC Paris, as well as in two international locations chosen annually for their relevance to current global business issues.
Cornell-Queen's
Cornell-Queen's Executive MBA has Queen's School of Business and the Johnson School at Cornell University in New York combining forces. The 18-month program gives the student the chance to earn both a Queen's and a Cornell MBA. The program is offered in five Canadian cities and 12 in the U.S. Upon completion, Canadian graduates have the option to work in the U.S. for one year, with the possibility of extending their visa status.
Kellogg-Schulich
The Kellogg-Schulich EMBA program brings together the Schulich School of Business at York University and the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill. It is North America's first cross-border executive MBA. Officially launched in January, 2002, the Kellogg-Schulich EMBA has classes at both schools, with the option of studying abroad at several partner institutions.

Full text: How did thieves sneak $1-million worth of jewellery and a 100-kilogram safe out of the Bronfman mansion? Peter Cheney makes like a cat burglar and prowls for answers
The online crime map of Toronto looks like something from CSI : Digitized visuals are dotted with small yellow marks, each indicating the scene of a burglary in the past week. Some communities look like yellow pincushions, but not south Forest Hill, where monitored alarm systems, video surveillance and private security guards are the order of the day.
This week, a rare yellow dot appeared on the neighbourhood's online map.
Behind that dot is a unique criminal saga that has raised the hackles of some very wealthy people and shown just how far an enterprising thief can go. Last Saturday, some time between 7:30 and 10:30 p.m., a burglar (or burglars) made their way to the home of Paul and Judy Bronfman, scaled a wall, got through a second-storey window and made off with a safe that contained more than $1-million in jewellery.
The haul included a flawless, six-carat diamond and two Stanley Cup rings won by the Montreal Canadiens in the 1970s (the Bronfman family used to be part owners of the team). Although many burglaries aren't even reported, let alone investigated, the Bronfman case is getting the full-court press.
Toronto police have assigned detectives from the major crimes unit, and the Bronfman family has retained a high-powered private investigator who was formerly assigned to the Toronto homicide squad.
The Bronfman robbery raises serious questions about what the rich (and the rest of us) can do to protect ourselves from burglary. Crime researchers say there were 8,774 reported burglaries Toronto-wide last year.
The actual number would be far higher because some victims either can't be bothered to report the event or are concerned that it will raise their insurance premiums.
There are many factors that raise your chances of being robbed. Being rich is one of them. Although they are known as very private people, the Bronfmans' sheer wealth puts them on the radar of prospective thieves.
Mr. Bronfman is prominent in the Canadian film industry and is the scion of one of Canada's richest families. His father and uncle founded Brascan Corp., one of the country's most powerful conglomerates. Mr. Bronfman and his wife live in a 22,000-square-foot home on a closed street in Toronto's elite Forest Hill district. They have three children, aged 17, 19, and 21, and attend a large number of philanthropic functions; two nights before the burglary, they were at an awards dinner hosted by the Canadian Coalition of Christians and Jews.
For a high-end thief, couples like the Bronfmans become a criminal research project. "These aren't your average thieves," says Chris McGoey, an L.A.-based security expert whose clients include prosperous business people and celebrities. "These people knew what they were looking for."
Mr. McGoey has consulted on a long series of similar, targeted robberies in the U.S. Some have involved well-known celebrities who lost millions in jewellery and artwork. In almost all cases, Mr. McGoey says, the crimes were committed with inside knowledge that allowed thieves to defeat elaborate security systems and locate the most valuable items without delay.
Like many wealthy people, the Bronfmans have a high-end security system with live monitoring. The security firm was Avante, which provides everything from video surveillance to highly specialized services: When an Avante client goes on vacation, company staff take them to the airport, then pick up their mail and newspapers every day, to reduce the number of people who know that they are not home. Avante chief executive officer Manny Mounouchos says thieves can pick up information from countless sources. "A limo driver might mention that he took them to the airport, and the word goes out," he says. "The more people who know what you're doing, the less security you have."
Mr. Mounouchos says his company's security systems use the best technology in the business. They don't come cheap: Avante recently quoted a $400,000 security system for one Toronto homeowner, and the company's most popular monitoring package runs approximately $4,200 a year.
Police sources say the Bronfmans' security system included door and window contacts, glass-break and motion sensors, and an array of remote-controlled video cameras. The entire system was connected to Avante by a wireless link that would send an alarm signal directly to a BlackBerry in one of the company's dispatch vehicles. But on the night of the Bronfman robbery, all of this technology was rendered useless because the alarm was deactivated.
Although police won't say why the system wasn't on, sources familiar with the investigation say the Bronfmans and their children had gone out for the evening, but staff members were in the home at the time of the robbery.
"Nobody heard a thing," said Toronto police detective Frank Lazzaro, an investigator assigned to the case.
Although investigators refused to disclose details, sources say members of the Bronfman household staff have been questioned about the robbery. (None of the staff has been implicated or identified as suspects.)
Police are also canvassing pawn shops and known jewellery fences. Detective Liz Benoit of the major crimes unit said the high-profile nature of the jewellery stolen from the Bronfmans may lead to it being channelled to underground collectors. It may also be broken down, she said, so that the precious stones are less identifiable.
"We're considering every option," she said.
Police say there is little doubt that the robbery involved extensive planning. Other crime experts agree. "This is anything but a standard break and enter," says Irvin Waller, a criminology professor at the University of Ottawa who has studied the crime of burglary extensively. Prof. Waller has written several books, including one that examined robbery patterns in the city of Toronto.
As part of his research, Prof. Waller went to Canadian prisons to interview convicted thieves, and came away with a picture of a sharply divided criminal world. At one end of the spectrum was the garden-variety break-in artist, who typically came away with a DVD player, some cheap jewellery or, if he was lucky, some cash - the only robbery commodity that fetches 100 per cent of its nominal value.
At the other end of the spectrum was the rare and elusive professional burglar. Prof. Waller said these burglars reminded him of airline pilots, with a professional attitude and an expert sense of risk. Many had spent years studying building construction and alarm systems, and followed workout routines and diets that kept them in peak physical condition. To avoid jittery fingers, some avoided alcohol and caffeine for several days before a robbery.
"They were professionals," Prof. Waller said. "There was nothing careless about them." Despite the Bronfmans' efforts to keep a low profile, there are numerous people familiar with their home and routine, including household staff, maintenance workers, and construction workers employed on the lot next to their house.
"It's hard to imagine all the sources of information," Prof. Waller says. "The word goes out."
High-end burglars employ techniques that would amaze many homeowners. Blane Nordahl, an American burglar who specialized in robbing silverware in the Hamptons, Kennebunkport and other old-money enclaves, read Architectural Digest and the Robb Report to identify targets. He also went on guided tours of historic homes and contacted local real-estate agents, posing as a wealthy prospective buyer.
Mr. Nordahl committed hundreds of robberies, and was able to evade detection by a wide array of alarm systems, including motion detectors. He was also noted for his foresight when it came to forensics. To avoid leaving fingerprints, he wore cotton gloves. After a telltale footprint gave away his identity to police, he began wearing different sizes of shoes on every job, and disposing of them immediately.
Whether that level of criminal ingenuity was brought to the Bronfman robbery remains to be determined. Forensic unit officers have examined the scene, but police haven't indicated what evidence, if any, was found.
The stolen jewellery was stored in a Gardex safe on the second floor. The safe, which weighed an estimated 100 kilograms, was removed from the scene, and has not been recovered.
"My feeling is that it's an inside job," a police source said. "Someone knew something."

How not to get robbed:
Tips from the experts
* Don't feature your home in architecture or lifestyle magazines. Some thieves read them to scout locations.
* Don't tell people you're going on vacation.
* Hire a securities expert while you're away to minimize proof of your absence.
* Apply security laminate film to your windows. This prevents a burglar from cutting or breaking the glass to open the window.
* Install bars on main-floor windows.
* Install solid-core or metal doors at all entrance points.
* Equip doors with heavy-duty deadbolt locks with a one-inch throw bolt and reinforced strike plates with three-inch screws that penetrate into the wooden door frame.

Full text: Clear-bottom penthouse pool will provide dinner-time entertainment
The market timing might seem off, but the first luxury condos are arriving in Vancouver's working class Chinatown.
If all goes according to plan, by the summer of 2009, developer Cam Watt's vision for the high-end, $6-million restoration of the nearly 100-year-old Keefer Building will be realized.
Architects George Sharp and Charles Thompson built the Edwardian style building at 135 Keefer St. in 1910. The architects were most famous for designing Vancouver's landmark art deco Burrard Street Bridge. The warehouse originally built for the Vancouver Gas Company is currently undergoing a massive restoration that will combine its heritage façade with a sleek, contemporary wood-brick interior.
The four-storey building on the 25-foot-wide lot will be given an additional top floor and converted into four deluxe lofts, each occupying an entire floor. A large, pre-existing courtyard that runs up the east side of the building has made it possible to construct condos that are open to daylight, with optional patio access on each floor. On the bottom floor will be retail, including a small martini bar that will cater to the area's growing young condo market.
As to whether he's worried about the current real estate downturn, Mr. Watt - who plans to occupy the opulent penthouse of the Keefer Building - appears unfazed.
"We're only selling three units, and there's really no competition," he shrugs, seated in a Chinese bakery next to the site. "What I'm offering is really unique. So I'm not really competing with the other sellers in the city. No one else has done it."
The price range of the 2,400-sq.-ft. apartments is $1.69-million to $3.9-million, a price tag that reflects features such as private indoor/outdoor courtyards, a unique elevator car storage that operates by remote control, private elevators to the suites, and a penthouse unit that has a 40-foot-long, clear-bottom swimming pool. The roof-top pool was designed by the same Colorado company that made the water tank in which stunt artist David Blaine submerged himself for seven days a couple of years ago.
Inside the penthouse suite, the clear-bottom rooftop pool will operate like a massive overhead display, particularly when someone is swimming in it.
Mr. Watt, whose company is Two By Four Developments, got the idea for the pool from a friend. Architects, a structural engineer, and a local pool designer spent three months researching the possibility. The cost of the acrylic pool, including shipping, was $80,000. But that price tag was trifling compared with having to negotiate with the city for their plans for the first interior clear-bottom pool.
"There is nothing going across the pool to hold it up," explains project architect Chris Woodford. "There's a really big steel beam that runs down its sides and it kind of hangs there. For a residential application, this is not done often, or ever."
The cost of the two-level, four-car elevator was approximately $140,000, which isn't as expensive as underground parking, Mr. Watt points out. As well, says Mr. Woodford, it keeps extra cars off the crowded streets of Chinatown.
The Keefer is Mr. Watt's first condo development. He is a house developer and successful entrepreneur who co-founded the Canadian Springs bottled water company.
He commissioned architect Gair Williamson, who has spent most of his career in London, England, but earlier in his career designed Toronto's Princess of Wales Theatre.
He has already worked on several heritage buildings in the area, but none of them, he says, are as high-end as The Keefer.
Mr. Williamson says the project is about saving a heritage building that had stood vacant, filled with pigeon feces, and rotting for the last decade. He says it's not about gentrifying an area that has long been filled with single-room occupants, which is an ongoing concern in the impoverished and struggling downtown eastside. (The project was undertaken with incentives from the city's Heritage Building Rehabilitation Program, such as bonus building density.)
"This project got through the heritage program because it was very clear it was not hurting any housing stock," he says. "There's nothing you could do with this project except for what Cam is doing.
"If it wasn't for someone stepping up and doing this sort of thing, it would have been knocked down."

Real estate gets the Obama boost

Author: Ireland, Carolyn

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/real-estate-gets-obama-boost/docview/382701913/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Benjamin Tal, senior economist at CIBC World Markets, predicts that Toronto house prices will continue to soften in the coming months as the Canadian economy remains stalled. But he adds that Canada does not have the subprime mortgage crisis that has hammered the U.S. housing market. "It is a correction but it's not a disaster," he says of the Canadian real estate market. "It's not a freefall."

Full text: A positive vibe rubs off
Has the "Barack effect" taken the chill off Toronto's housing market?
While the United States basks in the warm glow of a new president-elect, many Toronto real estate agents have noticed a pickup in sales in November after a truly dismal October.
Jeffrey McCann, a real estate agent with Sutton Group-Bayview Realty Inc., says Barack Obama's rise to the Oval Office appears to be one reason people are feeling more sanguine.
"There's definitely more momentum in the market," he says. "I think there has been so much negative news out there that anything positive has no border."
So much anxiety pervaded the market last month, he says, that people were afraid to spend money on almost anything. "I'm not even talking about real estate - I'm talking about people stopping at the local coffee shop."
Deirdre Kutasi of Coldwell Banker Terrequity Realty works with a lot of first-time buyers, who often borrow from their retirement savings accounts to make a down payment. Many clients were dismayed to see the size of their potential down payments shrink with the losses in the stock markets.
"Consumer confidence was really low. It made some buyers afraid to go through with deals," says Ms. Kutasi.
She isn't sure if the U.S. election has had a direct impact here, but she does believe that some prospective buyers have been soothed by seeing North American stock markets rebound from their October lows.
"I think a lot of people are getting their confidence back and starting to put together some offers."
Ms. Kutasi also says many clients are realizing that Toronto's housing market has some immunity from the economic woes in the United States because of strong immigration levels here and the urge of many suburban commuters to move closer to the centre of the city.
Cheri Dorsey McCann of Sutton Group-Bayview Realty believes people who are waiting for prices to fall further are missing an opportunity to troll for bargains now. The Bank of Canada has cut interest rates, listings are brisk and potential buyers are scarce.
"They [buyers] need to get it. They're very nervous."
With so many house-hunters thinking the same way, she says, bidding wars have all but dried up. For the first time in many years, people who go in with an offer are often able to negotiate a reduction in the listing price.
"They don't have the competition, they don't have the multiples, they don't have the fighting."
She points to a house she listed this fall near the Cricket Club with an asking price of $2.9-million. After about eight months, it sold for $2.1-million.
Ms. McCann points out that the buyers not only paid $800,000 less than asking, they saved on the land-transfer tax as a result.
Another house she listed for $625,000 on St. Germain Avenue now has an asking price of $559,000.
The irony, Ms. McCann says, is that so many potential buyers plan to stay on the sidelines for a few months, she foresees a return to bidding wars when people crowd into the market all at once.
"If everyone waits until the spring, we'll be back in multiple offers."
While some sellers have the luxury of waiting for a good offer, some homeowners are under pressure to sell, she adds. Perhaps they have to move because of a baby on the way, a marriage break-up or a job relocation. Or they may have bought another property before the market fell into the doldrums.
When those homeowners cut their asking prices, it will have a cascading effect in the neighbourhood because even sellers who are not desperate will feel they have to match the lower prices.
"When one person reduces, they all reduce because you're fighting for the next offer," Ms. McCann says. "They're not desperate, but they have to lower their price to compete with the person who is."
The agent says that buyers who want to move up or to downsize are putting their houses on the market first and then looking around for something else to purchase.
"They know that once they've sold, they can buy at a very attractive price. People are upgrading because they feel they can buy their dream home for a lot less."
Ms. McCann also sees good opportunities in the market for investment properties. The rental market is hot, she notes, because so many people have been putting their plans to buy on hold.
She recently helped one client buy a house listed for $695,000. The client pays about $2,200 a month in mortgage costs but collects $3,000 a month in rent.
"They have someone else paying off their mortgage."
Benjamin Tal, senior economist at CIBC World Markets, predicts that Toronto house prices will continue to soften in the coming months as the Canadian economy remains stalled. But he adds that Canada does not have the subprime mortgage crisis that has hammered the U.S. housing market. "It is a correction but it's not a disaster," he says of the Canadian real estate market. "It's not a freefall."
Mr. Tal is not predicting a plunge in prices, and he cautions that the broad market data can be easily misinterpreted.
The 13-per-cent decline in Toronto's average selling price reported for October, compared with the same month last year, is likely a distortion, he says.
Mr. Tal points out that the market in October, 2007, was particularly robust because people were rushing to strike deals before the implementation of the city of Toronto's land-transfer tax.
"It's possible that the 13-per-cent, year-over-year drop was really an exaggeration. Statistics can be very dangerous."
Mr. Tal notes that the market appears to be frozen at the moment as buyers stand still. But he expects the spring market to return to a healthy balance between buyers and sellers.
"By spring, we could see a more balanced market," he says. "This will be a much more relaxed buyer."

Full text: 'Now the real story begins." That's the slogan Fox News is using to promote its coverage of the Barack Obama presidency. It's going to be "fair and balanced," of course. "No spin," that kind of stuff.
People, fear not. There are four glorious years of U.S. all-news coverage and TV comedy shows coming. It is going to be mental.
For instance, one night last week, Jon Stewart told a giddily amused TV audience, "Sarah Palin has been tagged and reintroduced into the wild." Oh no, she hasn't. Governor Palin is on CNN today. Wolf Blitzer will anchor The Situation Room from Florida where the Alaska governor is attending the Republican Governors Association conference. The interview will air throughout the three hours of The Situation Room (CNN, 4 to 7 p.m.) today. Then, Palin is on Larry King Live (CNN, 9 p.m.). On Monday night, Palin was on the Fox News Channel. Greta Van Susteren, who, as any sentient being who watches Fox (that'd be you and me) can tell, is Sarah Palin's No. 1 fan, gazed into the camera and said, "We're live from Anchorage ..." As if that were just the most peachy thing.
What followed was priceless. Utterly crazy TV. Asked about the famous shopping binge, Palin declared, "We hadn't really pursued that until we were sorta gittin' criticized." There was an explanation for the shopping, of course. Then, in an act of breathtaking sucking-up, Van Susteren told Palin that she had looked into this allegation that Palin didn't know Africa was a continent, not a country. Van Susteren said she had "grilled" her informant, and the allegation was totally untrue. It was liking watching two mall rats talk about the rumour mill at school. And it was sublime.
A good deal has been written recently about the possibility of declining ratings for the all-news channels and the lack of political-comedy material for Jay Leno, David Letterman and others, including Jon Stewart. There have been expressions of skepticism about the viability of Stephen Colbert and his satiric shtick of mocking right-wing ranters, such as those who populate Fox News.
It's all nonsense. As Fox News defaults to its best position - attacking everything "liberal," slamming the "mainstream media" and acting as both outsider and the unofficial opposition to Obama - it's all going to get gloriously manic. And funny. Colbert will have a rich vein of self-righteous blather to mine. Obama doesn't have to do much except attempt to reverse some of what George W. Bush wrought, and a whole new war erupts, with an especially tantalizing front in the comedy arena. The political comedy can only get better.
And as for Jon Stewart (who has Bill O'Reilly from Fox News on his Friday show), all you have to know is that a newspaper in Oklahoma, The Sapulpa Daily Herald, did not report that Obama won the presidential election in its Wednesday edition last week. However, a paragraph on the front page noted that the majority of local voters opted for John McCain. Some readers protested outside the paper's offices, and one said, "I think that's just blatant racism." The paper's publisher defended the decision, saying Obama's victory was not a local story. Oh joy that such an America exists.
On CNN today, according to a news release, Blitzer plans to ask Sarah Palin "whether she plans to remain in the national spotlight." Oh please. Wild moose couldn't drag her away. And a good thing that is.
The fifth estate (CBC, 9 p.m.) is excellent tonight. It's an exposé of sorts - an in-depth look at how Canada, mainly Ontario, is failing to make many efforts to produce alternative energy sources. In fact, in many cases, Ontario seems determined to block attempts to move away from traditional energy sources.
The program opens in Germany, where Bob McKeown interviews Hermann Scheer, called "Europe's Al Gore." He's a politician who is leading the way to increase Germany's reliance on wind and solar power. To date, 15 per cent of Germany's energy comes from such renewable sources. Scheer has been to Canada and, apparently, is awed by the potential for use of wind and solar power here, but mystified by the inaction and lack of foresight. As McKeown discovers, anyone here who tries to challenge the conventional energy industry meets a brick wall. Among others, we meet a farmer in Ontario who can generate enough energy to power 350 homes but has been continually thwarted in his attempts to harness that energy.
Check local listings.

Also airing tonight
GENERAL IDEA: ART, AIDS, AND THE FIN DE SIÈCLE (TVOntario, 9 p.m., on Human Edge ) is a wonderful, rich and textured look at the trio of young Canadian artists who formed the collective called General Idea in the late 1960s. Gay, irreverent and drenched in the art-theory that would later fuel the punk movement, they were more honoured in Europe than at home. In the 1980s, one of their iconic creations was their own twist on Robert Indiana's LOVE artwork, replacing the letters in LOVE with those in AIDS. Two members of General Idea died of AIDS in 1994. Annette Mangaard's documentary is a superb celebration of the genius of General Idea.
THE 42ND ANNUAL CMA AWARDS (ABC, 8 p.m.) is, of course, "Country Music's Biggest Night." You're darn tootin' it is. Brad Paisley and Carrie Underwood will unite to host it. Brooks & Dunn, Kenny Chesney, Alan Jackson, Miranda Lambert, George Strait, Sugarland, Taylor Swift and Keith Urban will perform. Ain't no Democratic victory gonna stop this hillbilly hoedown. J.D.

Full text: In the midst of the current bear market, two Canadian companies are launching mutual funds next Monday that will invest in the frontier emerging markets of Africa and the Middle East.
Mackenzie Financial Corp. is marketing Mackenzie Universal Africa & Middle East Class, while Franklin Templeton Investments Corp. has the Franklin MENA Fund.
It is impossible to foresee whether stock markets will go lower, but "the entry point" in the region now will make sense over the longer term, suggested David Feather, president of the fund arm of Mackenzie Financial.
The region's markets are appealing because they have a low correlation to global capital markets, including emerging markets, Mr. Feather said yesterday. "Africa and the Middle East are dominated by local money rather than global capital flows."
Unlike the Mackenzie fund, which will invest in all of Africa and the Middle East, the Franklin Templeton fund focuses on securities of 12 countries in the Middle East and North Africa, or the so-called "MENA" countries.
While people assume the MENA region is an oil and gas play, that is not the case for the Franklin Templeton fund, said Stephen Fiorelli, vice-president of marketing strategy for Franklin Templeton.
The manager sees opportunities in real estate and construction, logistics and transportation, fertilizers and financials, Mr. Fiorelli said.
That fund will be run by Dubai-based Algebra Capital, which is 25-per-cent owned by Franklin Templeton's parent. The Mackenzie fund will be run by Investec Asset Management based in Johannesburg.
Independent fund analyst Dan Hallett acknowledged that it "could be an interesting time" now to invest in these regions for those who believe they have long-term growth potential.
But it's tough for many investors to do so given that they have seen emerging indexes plunge about 65 per cent from last fall's peak to the recent trough, Mr. Hallett said.

Full text: A year ago, when real estate agent Michelle Diehl sold a three-bedroom condo near the mountain town of Steamboat Springs, Colo., for $295,000 (U.S.), the property had been on the market for only six days, and the buyers were so eager that they put up the money for the place sight unseen.
It's not so easy selling real estate in Steamboat Springs any more. Now, Ms. Diehl is trying to sell a similar condo that's in better shape, and is listed at a lower price - but has been sitting on the market for months.
"It's a different time," she says.
For Intrawest ULC, which set off the real estate frenzy when it bought the Steamboat Springs ski resort in late 2006, the swift and radical reversal is hitting hard.
As recession grips North America, consumers have little confidence in the economy and are slashing spending. Plans for fancy ski trips costing thousands of dollars to destinations such as Steamboat in Colorado or Intrawest's Whistler-Blackcomb in British Columbia are among the first luxuries to get axed - never mind buying real estate there.
So, instead of expanding Steamboat Springs in the model of Whistler to better compete with glitzy Colorado rivals Aspen and Vail, the Vancouver-based resort developer and operator and is playing a defensive game instead.
The difficult business outlook pushed talks to refinance $1.7-billion of Intrawest debt to just hours before the money came due on Oct. 23, with Intrawest owner Fortress Investment Group LLC scrambling to get the deal done.
The debt was taken on in 2006 when Fortress bought Intrawest for $1.8-billion in a highly leveraged buyout, using a two-year term loan at 6.4 per cent to finance the takeover.
Details of the refinancing were not released but Intrawest's debt had been yielding 9 per cent in the market.
Negative after negative is piling on Intrawest. Interest payments are up. Visits to ski areas this winter are set to fall. Resort real estate is moribund.
Intrawest owns 10 winter resorts in North America and one golf resort, places where it also has real estate. It has broader real estate operations in locales such as Hawaii and California's Napa Valley through its Playground Destination Properties Inc. arm. Finally, Intrawest owns boutique travel businesses, including Canadian Mountain Holidays Inc., the world's No. 1 helicopter-skiing operation.
In all areas, Intrawest is feeling stress, from its heli-ski business, where a single trip starts at $975 (Canadian) per day, to Whistler, where the local tourism office predicts the number of visitors this winter to town will slump to about 900,000 from roughly one million a year ago.
The company, and other businesses in Whistler, have reacted quickly. Intrawest, for Whistler and other domestic properties, immediately sought to capitalize on the plunging Canadian dollar, marketing more in the U.S., in Washington State for Whistler and New York State for Mont Tremblant, located north of Montreal.
At Whistler, the company is heavily marketing next month's opening of an ambitious and eye-catching $52-million gondola that connects mid-mountain hubs on Blackcomb and Whistler, crossing the valley between the two mountains.
Intrawest is also playing up cheaper airfares, offering bigger discounts for booking early and pressing its long-time visitors not to skip regular winter trips.
"Even in these challenging times, they're not taking that trip to Whistler or Mont Tremblant off their list," said Andy Wirth, chief marketing officer at Intrawest.
Skiers may still come to ski but real estate is in trouble across Intrawest's portfolio and the focus is filling up rooms with vacationers rather than selling new properties.
In Destin in northwest Florida, Intrawest has a beach and golf resort called Sandestin. Susie Kirkland, who has been a realtor for almost 40 years in the region, said she has never seen such a difficult market.
"We have no shortage of properties," said Ms. Kirkland of Re/Max Southern Realty.
In Hawaii, Intrawest is opening the first of two buildings at Honua Kai on the beach in Maui in January. The first sold out quickly in 2006 but the second is not yet fully sold and the market is frozen, leaving the company to focus on a smooth opening instead of thinking about potential expansions.
"There's no sense of urgency, people are waiting for some stability," said Hugh O'Reilly, former mayor of Whistler and a sales manager for Honua Kai at Intrawest's Playground Destination Properties.
"It's a message you're hearing everywhere. People are not in a buying mode of any sort."
While the outlook for Intrawest is weak, the privately held company should be able to manage through the recession, according to past public results.
In the post-9/11 travel slump in the winter of 2001-02, Intrawest revenue from its resort operations fell 1.4 per cent to $485-million (U.S.). But real estate prices were rising at the time and company revenues in total were up for fiscal 2002.
More recently, in fiscal 2006, just as Fortress was buying Intrawest, the resort company saw its overall revenues fall for the first time in at least a decade, slipping to $1.61-billion from $1.62-billion as real estate revenue had a rough year, down 22 per cent to $489-million from $628-million.
Rival Vail Resorts Inc., owner of five ski hills led by Vail Mountain in Colorado, and real estate, is much like Intrawest, facing precisely the same business challenges. Yet in early October, debt-rater Moody's Investors Service Inc. raised its rating on Vail debt by one notch.
Jacques Ouazana, a Moody's analyst, said obvious negatives are real estate and the recession - but added that mountains inspire fanaticism among skiing and snowboarding enthusiasts. So while people might not make long trips for their fix, places like Vail and Whistler will still draw crowds even in tougher times.
"The local customers represent a safety net for these companies," Mr. Ouazana said.
*****
Intrawest retrenches
The company, which calls itself an operator of "experiential destination resorts," is involved in businesses ranging from high-end ski resorts such as Whistler-Blackcomb to real estate in Hawaii. The recession will hit both and Intrawest is trying to respond.
Numbers
* 9 million: Number of skier visits to Intrawest resorts, more than any other North American operator
* 2 million: Skier visits at Whistler-Blackcomb
* 60 million: Number of skier visits in the United States in the 2008 winter season, a record
* 58 million: Estimated number of skier visits for the 2009 winter
* 12 per cent: Estimated decline in visitors to Whistler for the 2009 winter
What Intrawest is doing
Moving quickly: Has been promoting cheaper Canadian dollar to Americans since early October.
Offering more discounts: Booking early now saves customers 35 per cent at Whistler, up from 30 per cent last year.
Shifting markets: Dollars on advertising are being pulled closer to home, such as Whistler focusing more on Washington State and less on Britain.
Going to those you know: Heavy marketing to customers who have visited before.
Focusing on existing assets: In real estate, Intrawest is working to rent space that already exists rather than planning new projects to sell.

Abstract: Mr. [Dean Fortin] has said that what he's offering on that issue is experience, plus "a little less conversation and a lot more action." Mr. Fortin, who used to run a non-profit organization dedicated to helping kids get off the street, said he's been frustrated with the slow pace set under Mr. Lowe.Mr. Reid also promises more action on homelessness, but says that can only come from someone with a "new approach and new energy."

Full text: People throughout B.C., in towns big and small, are facing big problems: crime, homelessness and economic turmoil among them. And now they have to decide who to trust to lead them out of it all
Frank Leonard has knocked on many doors in his 22 years of running for council in Saanich, a city north of Victoria on Vancouver Island. He's heard nearly every question in the book. But the one he's getting this year, ahead of the Nov. 15 civic elections, is a little different: "Are you sure you want to be mayor?"
What it means is: "Are you sure you want to have to steer the ship when there's an economic hurricane blowing and no one knows what's going to happen next?"
B.C.'s 160 cities, towns and villages were already facing challenges when candidates started campaigning earlier this fall. Homelessness, the lack of affordable housing and pressures from turbo-powered development are hitting larger or rapidly growing cities hard.
In smaller and rural cities and towns, it's the loss of industry jobs and general economic doldrums that predominate. Crime is a persistent problem in all of them, with suburbs that had previously been seen as safe havens now dealing with gang murders and rampant grow-ops.
Then the economic storm hit, prompting candidates to scramble together promises to keep a firm hand on the budget and keep taxes down. Premier Gordon Campbell also threw a curve into their campaigns by announcing, just two weeks before election day, that he would freeze all property assessments - the basis for how city property taxes are calculated.
That move has bemused city councils and property appraisers alike, since it doesn't actually change how much people pay in property taxes. But it does raise a small expectation in the minds of beleaguered owners that there might also be a tax freeze. That's causing some chaos, says NDP MLA Bruce Ralston, who used to be a Surrey councillor.
"He's totally confused everyone for no discernible purpose," Mr. Ralston said. He has no idea whether that means councils will face angry taxpayers if cities are forced to raise taxes.
But whatever the impact next year, the Premier's move has added one more cloud to a darkening sky in a tough and somewhat peculiar year.
For one thing, the plethora of elections far and wide will have an impact on civic voting. After the federal election and two Vancouver by-elections in October - not to mention the drama-filled national balloting in the United States this month - there is an expectation of voter fatigue. "I suspect we're heading for one of the lowest turnouts ever," speculated Dean Fortin, who is running for mayor in Victoria.
In addition, those elections in Canada, combined with the economic problems, also tapped out contributors, especially developers who are often the biggest donors to civic campaigns.
And they removed a number of candidates from the scene. Several council members, such as Squamish Mayor Ian Sutherland and City of Surrey Councillor Judy Higginbotham, ran in the federal election and, because of the timing, couldn't also run in city elections without looking as though they were hedging their bets.
Another group of well-known mayors, including Herb Pond in Prince Rupert and Terry Lake in Kamloops, also announced they wouldn't be running because they were going to run for the B.C. Liberals in the May, 2009, election.
That has resulted in a dearth of candidates in some places. About one-quarter of the province's mayors will be acclaimed - the same proportion as in 2005, but this time the acclamations hit some larger cities and towns around the province. They included the city and district of North Vancouver, the smelter town of Trail and B.C.'s premier surfing town, Tofino.
Despite the general expectations of a low turnout, there are signs in at least some cities with hot-button issues that next Saturday's elections are going to attract a healthy number of voters - perhaps a consequence of the excitement generated by the American election, some analysts say. Vancouver's first advance poll on Wednesday attracted a significantly higher number of voters than the same advance poll three years ago - about 3,500 compared to 2,000 in 2005.
"We're assuming people picked up election fever from last night," said Trout Lake polling station supervisor Raymond Milne, the day after U.S. voters turned out in large numbers to elect Barack Obama as president.
While no B.C. city has candidates anywhere near the stature of Mr. Obama, many voters face a similar choice to the one Americans confronted - between the status quo and change, experience and new approaches. In stormy times, they will decide who they think is best able to lead them to a safe harbour, from the field of candidates still willing to take on the job.
KEY CITIES BY FRANCES BULA
VANCOUVER
This campaign is rapidly developing more hairpin turns than a hiking trail in the Rockies.
Five weeks ago, the campaign in Vancouver started out with a focus on homelessness. Both Peter Ladner, the mayoral candidate for the governing Non-Partisan Association, and Gregor Robertson, the challenger from the new centre-left Vision Vancouver, said it was their priority.
But Mr. Robertson, a former NDP MLA, promised change and new leadership on the issue, saying Mr. Ladner was part of a council that had done little on it.
Then Mr. Ladner moved on to make his priority - at first - crime, but then, as the economic winds shifted, the budget. He promised a cap on tax increases and said the city needs his experience to weather the tough times ahead.
All those issues got tossed out when controversy erupted over the fact that Mr. Robertson had not paid his fine for having a one-zone ticket when he was travelling over two zones on SkyTrain.
But all of that was overtaken on Thursday, when news erupted in The Globe and Mail that the city of Vancouver had given a secret $100-million loan to the developer building its Olympic village.
That prompted Mr. Robertson to accuse Mr. Ladner of shoddy financial leadership.
No one can begin to predict where the final week of this race will go.
2005 turnout: 32½ per cent of 407,040 eligible voters
VICTORIA
It's not often that civic-election candidates get arrested during their campaigns, but that's been one of the highlights of Victoria's race. That's because several homeless people entered as candidates, in a year where homelessness has taken centre stage.
But the main candidates, after long-time mayor Alan Lowe called it quits this year, are Dean Fortin, a veteran councillor, and Rob Reid, a businessman who runs a sporting-goods store.
Homelessness, already an issue in the city, moved to centre stage when a B.C. judge ruled recently that the homeless could not be arrested for sleeping in city parks if they had no shelters to go to. That has resulted in ongoing tussles with police, who continue to arrest them if they stay past a certain hour.
Mr. Fortin has said that what he's offering on that issue is experience, plus "a little less conversation and a lot more action." Mr. Fortin, who used to run a non-profit organization dedicated to helping kids get off the street, said he's been frustrated with the slow pace set under Mr. Lowe.Mr. Reid also promises more action on homelessness, but says that can only come from someone with a "new approach and new energy."
"We need to move forward with some timelines," he said. He also emphasizes the need to partner with the province as a solution.
2005 turnout: 26 per cent of 64,000 eligible voters
PRINCE RUPERT
Other cities worry about growth and development. That's not Prince Rupert's problem, which has seen its population shrink by a quarter in the past decade. Instead, the big focus in this city's election campaign is on its current and possible future economic woes.
It has lost industries and jobs, as commercial fishing has declined and pulp mills and sawmills have closed. It's also struggling with significant debt that built up when the mills folded and didn't pay their back taxes.
The mayoral race here is a match between two former mayors.
Jack Mussallem, a former government administrator, was mayor from 1996 to 1999. Don Scott, a retired accountant, was mayor from 1999 to 2002. Both say their priority is working on Prince Rupert's financial situation.
"The municipality has been grappling with hard times," Mr. Mussallem said.
But Mr. Mussallem is talking about much more radical action than Mr. Scott. He says the city needs to economize, must keep any tax increase to a minimum, and should look at selling some of the property that it's holding.
Mr. Scott says that, before doing anything drastic, he would set up three forums in the next 12 to 18 months on economic development, social issues and culture. "I did that nine years ago and we did find some solutions," Mr. Scott said. 2005 turnout: 46 per cent of 9,000 eligible voters
CHILLIWACK
This onetime agricultural community at the eastern end of the Fraser Valley used to be far from city problems. Now, its big issues are crime, homelessness and sprawl.
Crime has hit the Fraser Valley hard in the past few years, as murder, mayhem and drug operations have moved out of the central city. "There's been a lot of gang activity and emerging gang culture here," said mayoral candidate Sharon Gaetz, a onetime church minister who has been a councillor for 11 years.
That was brought to the fore only a couple of months ago, when a real estate agent was slain at a house in one of the area's upscale new developments. "This has put a lot of fear into people," said Ms. Gaetz.
Her plan: Keep striving to shut down local grow-ops. Ms. Gaetz also says she would push for longer sentences for criminals to keep them off the streets.
Her main opponent, about-to-be-retired real estate agent Wayne Massey, agrees that crime is a priority and he doesn't criticize Ms. Gaetz's platforms. Instead, he says that someone like himself with connections in the business community, who knows how to manage and lead people, would be an advantage to the city.
The third candidate is Norm Smith, a former Green Party member who has been campaigning to protect agricultural land. 2005 turnout: 14.7 per cent of 50,381 voters
KELOWNA
This city in the B.C. Interior used to be renowned for its beaches, its fruit orchards and its vacation appeal. It's now a booming city that's added 20,000 residents in the past 10 years and the pressures from that kind of growth have brought out a record number of council candidates.
They were spurred on by a recent battle over approving a plan to dramatically increase density in the downtown and allow 27-storey towers.
Mayor Sharon Shepherd is unlikely to lose her seat unless her second-time challenger, Kim Ouellette, gets far more than the 115 votes she did in 2005.
But there are 36 people competing for eight council spots. With four current councillors not running again, the new councillors will define the city's future direction.
One new candidate, John Zeger, gathered thousands of signatures opposing the downtown plan.
Angela Reid, who runs a consulting company for green-business development, was also opposed to the plan. She says she wants Kelowna to absorb development in a way that's good for both residents and the environment.
But businessman Perry Mack said he would have voted for it because it was visionary. Mr. Mack said there are some council candidates who think they can somehow preserve the city as it was in the 1940s.
2005 turnout: 31½ per cent out of 82,080 eligible voters

Full text: Latest equipment, materials bring dwellings into the modern age
The first snow of the year appeared on Oct. 21 in my neighbourhood and my first thought was, "Great. Six more months of this." Then, to compensate for that soul-destroying thought came an image of a roaring wood fire set in a snug and toasty log ski chalet.
The imagery was helped along by an e-mail I'd gotten about a new log house in the Kawarthas possibly being the first such structure in Canada to receive an Energy Star rating. That means it's between 20 and 30 per cent more efficient than conventional homes. Take that, Old Man Winter!
This particular house was custom-made for a couple who own a lakeside plot near Bobcaygeon, Ont. Getting it to the point where it warranted the Energy Star rating was a collaborative effort driven by the homeowners' commitment to reducing their carbon footprint. They'd purchased a log-house kit manufactured by Confederation Log Homes, also based in Bobcaygeon, with the intent of making it as energy-efficient as possible. Once the structure was erected, they hired local builder R. Moore Homes to take it to the next level.
I spoke with Mike Murphy, president of Confederation Log, about what his product offers in terms of energy-efficiency and learned that there are several construction elements that contribute to it.
One is the size of timbers used. His company sells two sizes: six inches thick by 12 inches high or eight inches thick by 12 inches high. (The logs can be either northern white pine or western red cedar.)
This makes for a very thick wall whose natural thermal mass holds the heat. Other log-home companies use smaller logs and compensate for the reduced thermal mass by manufacturing a double-log wall with an air cavity that can be insulated.
The Confederation Log kits also include extra-deep roof trusses whose additional depth provides space for maximum insulation.
The log-joining system is another major factor, one that relates directly to air-tightness, an Energy Star requirement. The cutting of log joints and notches is controlled by computer, as opposed to the logs being handcrafted on site. The result is an extremely tight and consistent fit between logs.
Highly energy-efficient windows and doors complete the building envelope. When the Bobcaygeon house was completed, a door-blower test confirmed less than 1.75 air exchanges an hour. The Energy Star standard is 2.5.
To get the house to the finished stage, enter R. Moore Homes, based in Lindsay, Ont. I spoke with Glen Maidens, project manager for the company and a certified Energy Star builder. His company has always built to the R-2000 standard, so he knew how to meet the homeowners' requirements for their log home.
He explained that a small portion of the home had gabled ends and a loft that were built with standard studs and trusses.
This meant that some ceilings were flat while the home's main ceiling was cathedral. In the flat-ceiling areas he used spray-in Icynene foam insulation to achieve an R-50 value. In the cathedral log ceiling with the extra-deep trusses, he used a six mil (600 gauge or 0.15 mm) vapour barrier and R-44 batt insulation. In the basement walls, he added floor-to-ceiling R-20 batt insulation.
An additional factor that contributed to gaining the energy rating was the heating and cooling system. The home is heated with a forced-air tankless hot water system with a propane-powered boiler, and it has a heat-recovery ventilator as well.
The HRV keeps the air moving, which is important in an air-tight house. It draws outside air in and exhausts stale indoor air, recovering up to 70 per cent of the heat from the air it expels.
The home is cooled with an energy-saving 14 Seer air-conditioning unit. All appliances are Energy Star rated, as is the lighting, which uses compact fluorescent bulbs.
What does all this cost? Mr. Murphy estimates that with a 2,000-square-foot log-home kit and the interior finishing of the Bobcaygeon home, expect to pay between $300,000 and $400,000, excluding the cost of the land.

City stands guard over industrial land

Full text: In the 1989 movie Field of Dreams , an Iowa corn farmer, Ray Kinsella, hears mysterious voices blowing through the corn stalks, saying, "If you build it, they will come."
The voices tell Kinsella to build a baseball diamond in the middle of the corn field so that some of the game's great and long-dead stars, such as the disgraced Shoeless Joe Jackson, can once again play on some fantasy plain.
Kinsella's neighbours think he's nuts, and his family isn't to crazy about it either, but he listens to the voices, and after a few twists, it turns out okay, because that's how things worked out in Hollywood blockbusters in 1989.
City of Toronto planners appear to be listening to similar voices, drifting through the halls of Nathan Philips Square, whispering, "If you keep it, they will come back."
In this case, they are referring to some of the industrial buildings around Keele Street and St. Clair Avenue, as well as in a few other pockets in the city. Toronto's official plan - and the planners and councillors who fuss over it as if it were the Magna Carta - supports the concept that even complexes that are vacant and rotting should continue to be zoned industrial in case companies want to restart operations and require workers.
But as manufacturing jobs dry up and tougher environmental standards and expectations come into play, it is increasingly unlikely that heavy, or even light, industry will come back to 100-year-old buildings or the contaminated lands where they once stood.
Late last month, the Ontario Municipal Board rendered a decision that backed up the city's protection of industrial lands. The OMB, the court of last resort on development applications, denied a proposal by Terrasan Corp. to build two high-rise condominium buildings on Lloyd Avenue. The site on the southeast corner of Keele and St. Clair is occupied by a former Benjamin Moore paint facility.
Terrasan president and CEO Louie Santaguida is still smarting over the decision, which was especially difficult to swallow because the company had struggled for three years to make the development palatable to the city.
"For three years we made every effort to accommodate the city," he says. "The local community is totally in favour of more residential and there was no employment on that site in over 12 years."
In its effort to win over the city, Terrasan altered the project from purely residential to mixed-use, and spent millions of dollars cleaning up the site, according to Mr. Santaguida. (The company's expertise is in environmental remediation and redevelopment of contaminated sites.)
"We took a crack house and whorehouse out of existence [in preparing the Benjamin Moore site]," he says. "We are embraced with open arms outside of the GTA for revitalizing these sites to standards that haven't been seen in local residents' lifetimes. In Toronto, we get stonewalled."
It's true that in bygone days, the area was an industrial powerhouse, with slaughterhouses and food processing predominating but with other types of operations as well.
In the past decade, however, the slaughterhouses on the southwest corner of Keele and St. Clair have been replaced by the massive Stockyards Centre with Home Depot, Canadian Tire, Rona, Staples and Future Shop. On the northeast corner, Tribute Communities built a successful multiphased community of semis and townhouses. And just south of the intersection, closer to the Junction neighbourhood, Options for Homes is building a two-tower condo complex.
There is still some industrial activity in the area, but most of it is on a small to medium-size scale, such as auto repair facilities.
A majority of city councillors contend that Toronto is lacking in the supply of industrial lands (or as they call it, employment lands), and have been forceful about protecting them in the faint hope of luring jobs back to the central part of the city.
But the city is also going against the wishes of residents in the Keele and St. Clair area; they embraced the Terrasan project and want to see more of these properties converted to residential use.
The OfficeforUrbanism, a design consultancy, just finished an extensive study of the St. Clair corridor to advise the city on how best to map out development priorities after the completion of a rapid-transit streetcar line currently under construction.
"What we found in our study is that there was an enormous push by residents to have industrial lands converted to residential," OfficeforUrbanism partner Janet Keesmaat says. The firm advised the city to study the employment-land issue more deeply as to what constitutes industrial employment in the 21st century.
"Sometimes employment lands are intensive in terms of machinery, but not in the number of jobs," Ms. Keesmaat says.
With the improved transportation the rapid-transit line should provide, St. Clair would be a candidate for increased residential development.
"Having higher density where you have rapid transit should be paramount," Ms. Keesmaat says. "St. Clair meets that test."
Manufacturing companies aren't moving back to Keele and St. Clair. The Terrasan site, having been kyboshed, will now sit empty, waiting for the day when a Nissan or Magna will magically appear out of fairy dust to plant 600 new jobs in a vacant lot where taxes are relatively high and residents do not want the disruption of factories.

Full text: Likely dating back to the 1700s, one of the oldest houses in Prince Edward County seeks a new buyer. The sheep are waiting
Even among the long-standing houses of Prince Edward County, Shannon House is fabled: It may be the oldest 1n the county. It may have belonged to a French Count and fur trader. It possibly dates to the mid-1700s.
That's the historic lore, but the home's more recent past is almost as colourful.
Des Marcille spent his boyhood summers in the limestone house on Waupoos Island. Sometimes the family would arrive in the spring to find sheep from the neighbouring farm had found their way into the house during the winter.
"The sheep would climb up on the couches," Mr. Marcille recalled on a recent return to the island.
Sheep still figure prominently in the landscape around Shannon House.
Bob Fleguel is a farmer who purchased several hundred acres and a few grand old farmhouses from the Oblate order of missionaries two years ago. All told, Mr. Fleguel and his wife, Erin Roughan, own 560 acres of the 840-acre island.
The couple legally severed a parcel of 3.75 acres surrounding Shannon House and have listed the property with an asking price of $599,000.
The house's green lawns slope down to 620 feet of shoreline along Smiths Bay in Lake Ontario.
Behind the house, Mr. Fleguel's ewes graze over much of the island. The farmer figures he has about 1,600 ewes. Another 1,800 or so lambs swell the population in the spring.
Waupoos Island is located in the township of North Marysburgh, just across the water from the hamlet of Waupoos on Prince Edward County. It's a five-minute boat ride from Waupoos Marina to the island.
There, broker Gail Forcht of Chestnut Park Real Estate Ltd. is selling a rare tranquillity.
"The island has a feeling that one cannot put into words," says Ms. Forcht. "It's like stepping out of a boat into a magical place where time has stood still."
Clients who have made the boat trip over have told her that the rolling hills and sheep-dotted landscape reminds them of England.
The main road around the island - an unpaved track known as the King's Highway - barely makes a dent in the lawn of Shannon House. At one time the road led to a house, but all that remains of that building is the foundation.
"It's essentially a legal road, but nobody uses it," says Mr. Fleguel. There's nowhere to go."
Bill Cowan is a local amateur historian who has made a hobby of studying the area's oldest landmarks. He can't say with certainty when Shannon House was built because a land surveyor from Kingston didn't make it over to the island when he set out the lots in Marysburgh in 1783.
The island was owned and occupied by the Mississauga Indians until 1856, Mr. Cowan says, and the European immigrant farmers were squatters.
Mr. Cowan has found ample information about a Joseph Monteney, who was a fur trader living on the island in the 1700s. The story goes that Mr. Monteney was originally from Normandy. He settled first in New York State, married Margaret Frank, and fathered five children.
Intriguingly, Mr. Cowan says, many historical references mention a Count Monteney. The gentleman could well have been a member of the French nobility who fled his native country during the years' of persecution before the French Revolution, the historian believes.
In any case, Joseph Monteney gravitated to the St. Lawrence as the fur trade expanded. He settled on Waupoos Island and traded with the Indians for their fur pelts. First he built a log cabin, and later a house made of limestone gathered from the surrounding fields.
"This guy built this beautiful house on land that wasn't his," says Mr. Cowan. "It's built like a fortification."
Whenever it was built, the house was certainly standing when an Irish immigrant named Alexander Shannon arrived on the island around 1818. Some reports say that Mr. Shannon found the house abandoned, says Mr. Cowan, while others suggest he purchased it from the Monteney family. Official records have the Shannon family as the first registered owners.
Mr. Cowan says that a local writer named Archie Lamont wrote in the early 1900s that the Shannon House was probably the oldest in the county.
The historically-designated house is set into a hill that gradually slopes down to Smiths Bay.
The structure is approximately 35 feet wide by 25 feet deep with walls that are almost three feet thick. It's two-and-a-half storeys at the front and one-and-a-half storeys at the back.
Inside, the seven-bedroom house has a large living room with stone walls, a beamed ceiling and large wood-burning fireplace. Upstairs, floors are made of wide pine planks.
While the house has been updated over the years, Ms. Forcht suggests a new owner may want to upgrade the windows. Some of the rooms have been finished with drywall.
Because of the home's heritage designation, the exterior must remain unchanged, she adds.
Mr. Marcille's mother, Lea Shannon Marcille, was born in the house. She was a pupil at the Waupoos Island School in 1899, and returned as a teacher in 1910. She taught there again in 1948 and returned yet again in 1966 to work as the last teacher before the island school was closed.
Mr. Marcille remembers helping on the farm while his mother was teaching. For many years, he says, the stone house was rented out to vacationers during the summer.
Today, the island remains just about the same, with Mr. Fleguel's sheep and a few cottagers in residence.
Local authorities won't allow any more houses because they don't want to maintain the road, says Ms. Forcht.
"What's here is here."
Mr. Fleguel says the island doesn't have much of a social scene. The seven or so families that spend summer weekends there mostly reside at the eastern end of the island.
"We all meet at the dock," he says of the government-owned main dock that acts as community hub.
Perhaps the most highly-anticipated source of entertainment for local residents is Mr. Fleguel's annual spring trek across the ice with all 1,600 ewes.
The farmer puts some pebbles in a bucket and rattles it around a bit. The sound makes the more experienced ewes think he's carrying a pail of vittles and they begin to follow him.
"Once you've got 10 of them coming, you've got all of them coming."
Mr. Fleguel leads the ewes from his farm in the county over to the island where they give birth to their lambs in the spring and stroll around in the summer. The walk only takes about an hour.
"A lot of people want to see that, but the fact is, it's over pretty quick."
When the grass runs out in late November, Mr. Fleguel takes the sheep back across the water by barge. That process takes all day, he says, because he can only fit about 200 animals on the barge at a time.
By the standards of Waupoos Island, Prince Edward County across the gap is bustling. Bus tours visit the wineries and tourists pick apples at the farms. Cheese producers, celebrity chefs and entrepreneurs are launching new ventures. Proposals to install energy-producing wind farms in some areas are polarizing opinion in the community.
Ms. Forcht says the island makes an ideal get-away. For many years the Oblate religious order farmed on the island and operated a summer camp for disadvantaged families.
She adds that Shannon House would provide a serene location for a family haven or a yoga retreat, among other things. The crystal-clear water and sandy bottom provide an ideal spot for swimming, she says, and the area is well-known for sailing.
"I just feel like grabbing a chair and a book - and I don't get to do that very often."

Full text: Here are a few clever tactics for stretching your design dollars
With the global economy now at 7 o'clock of a hangover morning, this is the time for orange juice and quiet voices, not bright chatter about renovations and pricey home decor.
That's okay: Interior design is all about limitations - financial, structural, electrical - and designing a home on a budget means knowing where to splash out and where to rein in. Luckily, most designers have a few tricks for creating a professional look without breaking the bank. Here are a few I can share with you.
Deck the walls
The first trick is the most obvious one: paint. Changing the colour of your walls is cathartic and fresh paint breathes new life into your home. Don't restrict your work to the wall proper: cleaning up your trim, baseboards and repainting the doors will complete the job and the look. Warm greys, soft linens, and cool ivories are among my favourite colours these days.
Keep in mind that the "designer" paints, prettily marketed and packaged though they are, cost up to 40 per cent more than the brands professional painters use every day - General Paint or ICI, say. It's not an extra expense that will impress a visitor to your home. Besides, if you're in love with one of the designer colours, you can ask a technician to colour-match it in less expensive paint - just be sure to buy extra for touch-ups and the all-important second coat.
Be a dummy
Designers know that draperies add instant polish and sophistication to a room, especially spaces that tend toward the classical and traditional. But custom drapes for your average living room window require as much as 24 yards of fabric, plus the lining, labour and hardware. Using decent mid-market linen, for example, will cost you about $4,000. It's an investment.
Alas, in your living room, it's not a crucial one. Unless your pastimes are illicit or you're an amateur projectionist, there isn't any need for your living room drapes to block out all the light. You just need them to look pretty. And that's where dummy panels come in.
Dummy panels, for the uninitiated, are drapes that don't close. They flank either side of the window and, although they're often only a few inches wide, they're an excellent way to create a mood.
On the average window, dummy panels need one-third of the fabric that functioning drapes do. (Tip: Request a flannel layer between the decorative fabric and the lining; it'll make the dummy panel look full and luxurious.) As for material, silk, linen and cotton velvet are all well-priced and come in a multitude of colours. When the budget is tight, I go straight to the plain raw silk and choose a neutral colour that can stand the test of time. Using this fabric, panels for an average window run about $1,200.
Don't blow your budget on drapery hardware. Select a simple metal rod that is no less than one inch in diameter. Anything smaller looks chintzy and spindly. Keep the finials (those end-of-rod balls) simple - crystals and fleurs-de-lis are not in the budget, and, hopefully, not in the look.
Forgo bed for board
When the Dow is again riding high and we've weathered the "worst economic crisis since the Great Depression," the timing for a deluxe bedroom will be better. At that time, I'll counsel you to get French linens, a custom chaise, and, best of all, a mahogany four-poster bed. In the meantime, you can update your sleeping area with a sophisticated though much less expensive option: an upholstered headboard.
You can have a headboard made at any upholstery shop; most dealers can show you a number of styles. I stick to pared-down shapes - squares or soft curves, sometimes with brass tacking. The key is to request a style that attaches to the wall and allows your mattress and bed frame to rest easily against it.
An upholstered headboard requires little fabric (three to five yards), so choose a bold pattern or bright colour to infuse vitality into a bedroom.
Get artfully cheap
Art and images give a home personality, and a savvy designer will never let the walls go bare. It's ideal to have original artwork in the home, but there are tasteful and attractive alternatives to juicy new oil paintings on every wall.
On a recent project, we went to the city archives and purchased digital files of photographs taken in the 1900s ($11 a photo). We had them printed and framed in simple black frames with big ivory mattes (finished dimensions were 48 by 52 inches). The resulting pieces hung in the entrance of the home, looking elegant and substantial. They fill the space with local history and cost us a tenth of what a series of paintings would have.
Another inexpensive and poignant solution we recently effected involved an old Winnie-the-Pooh book we found in an antique market. It was seven bucks. We had our 12 favourite pages framed in a delicate gold on an archival matte, and installed them in a little girl's room, six on each wall.
Having a comfortable home isn't a matter of throwing money at everything. While for some things, there's no two ways about it - to have the sumptuousness and elegance you want, you have to shell out.
But for other things, money isn't the highest good - a sense of style is better, and so are some crafty tricks. It isn't how much you've got, after all, it's what you do with it.

Full text: Home sales in the Greater Toronto Area fell 35 per cent this October compared with sales a year earlier, according to the Toronto Real Estate Board. Prices fell 10 per cent over the same period, leading the industry to acknowledge the existence of a deep slump in the market.
"Consumer confidence is critical to the housing market and it appears that consumer uncertainty has been prevalent in today's market conditions," board president Maureen O'Neill said in announcing the numbers.
The decline is evident across the region, with the average home price dropping to $352,974 from last October's $394,646. Prices and sales both dropped most quickly inside city limits, where the average price dropped 13 per cent, to $376,896 from $434,022, and sales fell 38 per cent.
But no region was immune. Sales dropped 32 per cent in the 905 suburbs and the average price there was down 8 per cent compared with a year ago, to $364,142 from $336,049.
Realtors in Western Canada reported similar price drops. The Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver played up buying opportunities after it saw a 55-per-cent dive in housing prices from this time last year. The Calgary board reported a 26-per-cent drop in metro sales during the same annual period.
Toronto-area houses are also sitting on the market much longer, according to the board, with the average one taking more than a month to sell.
The latest numbers appear to have persuaded real-estate professionals that the market is in a deeper slump than they had been willing to admit.
The Toronto board dismissed early evidence of decline as the result of excess snowfall at the beginning of the selling season. Subsequent declines were attributed to the new municipal land-transfer tax.
Last week, board spokesman Von Palmer told The Globe and Mail the October figures would show the negative impact of a land-transfer tax that came into effect in February, repeating a concern expressed by Ms. O'Neill earlier in the month.
But the results put an end to the talk. Instead of the new tax, Ms. O'Neill blamed media reports from the United States for "unduly" affecting confidence in the local market. "There's no question that in Canada the economic fundamentals to support a healthy housing market remain in place."
Another tactic the board had used in recent months to minimize evidence of decline was to compare current sales with those posted two years ago, in 2006. In that context, current drops in sales and prices can look more like a return to normal after an exceptionally buoyant 2007. The current figures are "indicative of a return to a more-balanced market," according to the board.
But are they? Sales last month were 25 per cent lower than they were in the same month two years earlier, according to the October report. Prices were 1 per cent lower compared with October, 2006, and they are steadily trending downward. It's a precarious form of balance.
Torontonians will quickly recover their appetite for residential real-estate once they realize how healthy the local market actually is, according to Ms. O'Neill.
"Earlier this year the International Monetary Fund undertook a study of housing markets in 17 countries and found that Canada was one of only two nations in which house prices are supported by the economy," she said. "There's no doubt that real estate will continue to be a solid long-term investment in our country."
Emphasis on "long term." In the meantime, watch out.

Full text:   Gracious in defeat, the Republican presidential candidate delivers a remarkably conciliatory concession speech
John McCain's "Straight Talk Express" ran out of gas last night, stalled by economic gloom, a deeply unpopular Republican president and a running-mate most Americans deemed unfit for high office.
The 72-year-old Arizona Senator lost what is likely to be his final White House run, urging thousands of supporters gathered at a posh Phoenix resort to embrace the country's first black president.
"Senator Obama has achieved a great thing for himself and for his country," Mr. McCain said in a remarkably subdued and conciliatory speech.
Mr. McCain urged his sometimes cheering, sometimes booing, faithful to unite around their new president.
"We have come a long way from the old injustices that once stained our nation's reputation and denied some Americans the full blessings of American citizenship."
Mr. McCain also praised Alaska governor Sarah Palin, who did not speak, as a great campaigner and an "impressive new voice in our party."
And he called his candidacy, "the great honour of my life."
Mr. McCain lost, and lost big, in key battleground states that he needed to win, including Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida. And he ceded states Republicans have owned for years, including Virginia in the East, and Colorado and Nevada in the West.
Mr. McCain's quest was always a long-shot. But his Hail Mary choice of Ms. Palin as his running mate may have sealed his fate. Exit polls suggest the vast majority of Americans didn't think Ms. Palin, the first woman ever on a Republican ticket, was ready to be Vice-President, let alone a heartbeat away from the presidency.
Mr. McCain and his supporters gathered at the lush Biltmore Resort and Spa for what was billed as a victory party.
As early returns began to come in, even the most faithful were second-guessing their candidate's campaign as they listened to country music legend Hank Williams Jr.
Lou Stall, 68, a Phoenix lawyer, faulted Mr. McCain for not being a "consistent conservative" in the mould of Ronald Reagan, and for backing the $700-billion (U.S.) bank bailout.
"That was a chance for him to sayno," Mr. Stall said. "He wasn't as strong as he could have been."
Ann Heins, a retired real estate agent from Tempe, Ariz., said Americans always "vote with their pocketbooks," and with the economy slumping, Mr. McCain had trouble getting out from under George W. Bush's shadow.
Mr. McCain may also have regrets. He faced stiff headwinds beyond his control, including the tanking economy and Mr. Bush's dismal approval ratings, but other problems were of his own making:
* The financial crisis: Mr. McCain made an awkward declaration in September that the "fundamentals of the economy are strong," as the country lurched toward recession, and large swaths of the banking system headed for collapse. * Joe the Plumber: Mr. McCain made the Ohio man, who had a chance encounter with Mr. Obama, a symbol of how the Democratic candidate would raise taxes and bring socialism to Washington. It turns out Joe's not a licensed plumber, owes back taxes to the state and would be a winner under Mr. Obama's tax plan. And his name isn't Joe. It's Samuel Joseph Wurzelbacher.
* Money: Unlike Mr. Obama, Mr. McCain accepted federal matching funds, thereby limiting how much he could spend through much of the campaign. Figures through mid-October showed Mr. Obama has spent roughly $240-million on television and radio ads. That compares with a combined $195-million by the McCain campaign and the Republican National Committee.
Even though his White House bid is over, Mr. McCain won't be leaving Washington. He'll continue to sit as a senator. He isn't up for re-election until 2010.
Even before most of the country had voted, Ms. Palin was speculating about her political future. After stopping by the Mocca Moose for a cup of coffee after voting yesterday in her hometown of Wasilla, Alaska, Ms. Palin told a local reporter that if she got involved in national politics again it would not be "so much partisan," according to Politico.com.

John McCain's "Straight Talk Express" ran out of gas last night, stalled by economic gloom, a deeply unpopular Republican president and a running-mate most Americans deemed unfit for high office.
The 72-year-old Arizona senator lost what likely is his final White House run, telling thousands of supporters in Phoenix that "the failure is mine, not yours."
Mr. McCain delivered a remarkably conciliatory and subdued concession speech. "I wish Godspeed to my former opponent, who will be my next president," said Mr. McCain, whose home state of Arizona was still too close to call as he spoke.
Mr. McCain lost, and lost big, in key battleground states that he needed to win, including Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida. And he ceded states Republicans have owned for years, including Virginia in the East, and Colorado in the West.
Mr. McCain's quest was always a long shot. But his Hail Mary choice of Alaska Governor Sarah Palin as his running mate may have sealed his fate. Exit polls suggest the vast majority of Americans didn't think Ms. Palin, the first woman ever on a Republican ticket, was ready to be vice-president, let alone a heartbeat away from the presidency.
Mr. McCain and his supporters gathered at the lush Biltmore Resort and Spa for what was billed as a victory party. He watched early returns from the Goldwater suite, named after the late Barry Goldwater, a five-term Arizona senator and failed 1964 presidential candidate. The tony hotel has special meaning for Mr. McCain. He and wife Cindy were married here.
As early returns began to come in, even the most faithful were second-guessing their candidate's campaign as they listened to country music legend Hank Williams Jr.
Lou Stall, 68, a Phoenix lawyer, faulted Mr. McCain for not being a "consistent conservative" in the mould of Ronald Reagan, and for backing the $700-billion (U.S.) bank bailout.

* George W. Bush: "I am not George Bush," Mr. McCain insisted during the final debate. Mr. McCain tried his best, but he couldn't run away from his fellow Republican - the most unpopular president in modern times. * Money: Unlike Mr. Obama, Mr. McCain accepted federal matching funds, thereby limiting how much he could spend through much of the campaign. Figures through mid-October showed Mr. Obama has spent roughly $240-million on television and radio ads.

Full text:   Members of a ratepayers group fighting a controversial resort development on Lake Simcoe have poured tens of thousands of dollars into a charitable organization that helped it fight the project.
Four members of the Innisfil District Association, including three members of the board of directors, gave money to Environmental Defence Canada, whose staff lawyer in turn acted on behalf of the IDA last year during a 24-day Ontario Municipal Board hearing on the proposed Big Bay Point Resort.
The challenge was rejected by the OMB and the developer, Kimvar Enterprises Ltd., is set to proceed. But Kimvar has returned to the OMB in an effort to force its opponents to cover its legal costs, which the company estimates at $3.2-million. The main arguments in the costs case concluded last week, with another hearing set for next month.
In the meantime, the Innisfil District Association has become the poster child in a campaign for legislation to protect local groups and individuals from potential financial ruin if they oppose a development and lose.
But the evidence presented at a six-day Ontario Municipal Board hearing on Kimvar's cost claim against the IDA suggests a more complex picture than a simple David-and-Goliath battle.
Not only were the legal costs of the IDA's participation in last year's hearing picked up in part by the EDC, the IDA's legal bills from the law firm it hired for the hearing to work with the EDC were sent directly to the First Canadian Place office of entrepreneur Murray Brasseur.
Mr. Brasseur, who heads investment and real estate management firm Middlefield Group, is part of a group that owns two properties adjacent to the proposed resort, which it wants to use to expand a nine-hole golf course that was founded in 1924.
Apart from the bills for July and August, 2007, that went to Mr. Brasseur, no other legal bills were submitted as evidence, and the only hearing cost that the IDA has entered in its evidence to the OMB was a bill of about $29,000 for expert reports.
Mr. Brasseur said in an interview that, while the bills were sent to him, he did not pay them personally, but directed a fundraising effort among IDA members to cover them.
He said that, in round figures, the initial bill from the law firm Gilbert's LLP was about $300,000. It was cut to about $150,000, which the IDA paid.
He also said that he does not understand why Kimvar is asking the IDA for costs.
"He [Kimvar's owner Earl Rumm] won. As far as we are concerned, we are out of there," Mr. Brasseur said. "We really want to be left alone, and do our little thing, and let Mr. Rumm do his thing."
Much of the evidence at the cost hearing was about the relationship between the Innisfil District Association and Mr. Brasseur, who is a shareholder in two companies that, along with the IDA, opposed the resort at the OMB.
The two companies, Nextnine Ltd. and 2025890 Ontario Inc., worked so closely with Environmental Defence that Rick Smith, the group's executive director, said in his testimony that he "never perceived any daylight between these entities."
The Big Bay Point project calls for a 240-hectare resort with an 18-hole golf course, 1,000-slip marina, 1,600 residential units and 400 hotel rooms to be built on Lake Simcoe, just south of the mouth of Kempenfelt Bay.
The company that would build it, Kimvar Enterprises, is a subsidiary of Geranium Corp., a company owned by Mr. Rumm, a developer with 25 years experience in Southern Ontario.
Mr. Brasseur said that there were discussions with Mr. Rumm that might have produced an agreement to make an expanded golf course part of the resort, but no deal was ever reached.
After discussions fell apart, Mr. Brasseur became an opponent of the project, Michael Miller, Kimvar's lawyer, told the OMB.
Separately from the OMB matter, Kimvar and Mr. Brasseur are engaged in a lawsuit over Big Bay Point, Mr. Rumm's spokesman, Jim Maclean, confirmed in an e-mail.
Mr. Brasseur said he joined the board of Environmental Defence Canada "about a year and half ago" after he encountered the organization because he was active in an environmental coalition that was campaigning to clean up Lake Simcoe.
According to EDC's annual report for the year ended March 31, it received donations of more than $10,000 from Mr. Brasseur last year.
He said in the interview that he has probably given a further $10,000.
EDC also received a donation of more than $10,000 from Middlefield Financial Services Ltd., a subsidiary of the Middlefield Group, the company founded and still chaired by Mr. Brasseur.
EDC also reports receiving tax-deductible donations of more than $10,000 from Roger Parkinson, the current IDA president and a former publisher of The Globe and Mail, as well as a donation in the $5,000-to-$9,999 range from IDA board member Patrick Mulqueen and $1,000-to-$4,999 from Don Avery, a former IDA president who now chairs its board.
In an interview, Dr. Smith, EDC's executive director, defended his organization's links with the Innisfil District Association.
"Raising money for work on important environmental causes is what every environmental organization does, and if Mr. Rumm does not like that, then tough," Dr. Smith said.

Full text:   The Donald has trumped his Scottish opponents.
Real estate tycoon Donald Trump won approval from the Scottish government yesterday to build what he says will be "the world's greatest golf course" on a stretch of Scottish coast, over the objection of local officials and environmentalists.
The $1.6-billion (U.S.) resort project was rejected by local authorities in Aberdeenshire last year, because part of a golf course is to be built on habitat of rare birds and other wildlife.
After the local council's decision, the Scottish government took the unusual step of agreeing to review Mr. Trump's application.
Issuing the government's final decision yesterday, Scottish Finance Secretary John Swinney said the resort was of "great economic and social benefit" to the country.
Mr. Trump, whose mother was born in Scotland, said that the resort would be a "tremendous asset and source of pride for both Aberdeenshire and Scotland."
"As I have often said, because of the quality of the land we are given to work with, we will build the greatest golf course in the world," he said.
The resort is expected to have two championship courses, a 450-room hotel and 500 luxury houses.
The Aberdeenshire Council rejected the resort late last year after local residents and conservationists said a course should not be built on a stretch of shifting sand dunes that are home to some of the country's rarest wildlife, including skylarks and otters.
But business leaders, tourism agencies and Scotland's First Minister, Alex Salmond, supported the development.
"The economic and social benefits for the northeast of Scotland substantially outweigh any environmental impact," Mr. Salmond said yesterday.

The Canadian TV racket: It's all about your money

Abstract: This didn't go over well with the Canadian Association of Broadcasters. In a sulky announcement on Friday, the CAB said, "The decision is fundamentally deficient in its effort to recalibrate the system for the ailing OTA sector." The gist, if you remove all the stuff about "recalibrate" and "fundamentally deficient" is that the broadcasters are so mad they could spit. Both CanWest and CTV would kinda like to see money come to them without much effort.

Full text:   First this: Cindy McCain, wife of Republican presidential candidate John McCain, appears on Larry King Live (CNN, 9 p.m.). That's all. That's your U.S. election fix for today.
I hate to do this to you. But, today, we're going to touch on the Canadian TV racket, a dark, menacing place, alive with obsessive, destructive desires. To make money, that is.
Oh yes it is. And we're going to take a pause from pondering the really, really big events in the United States (no, not Madonna's alleged tryst with A-Rod at Jerry Seinfeld's house) to consider the local TV racket. While you weren't looking, it's been a hive of activity.
The other day, the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission roused itself to issue a decision and a proclamation. The regulatory body denied an appeal by major broadcasters to allow them to charge cable and satellite companies to carry their signals. If allowed, this would have meant everybody paying more for cable or satellite, and the over-the-air broadcasters getting tens of millions of dollars in fees.
This didn't go over well with the Canadian Association of Broadcasters. In a sulky announcement on Friday, the CAB said, "The decision is fundamentally deficient in its effort to recalibrate the system for the ailing OTA sector." The gist, if you remove all the stuff about "recalibrate" and "fundamentally deficient" is that the broadcasters are so mad they could spit. Both CanWest and CTV would kinda like to see money come to them without much effort. That's just the way it is. Don't blame them for trying.
Meanwhile, in a few years, you the consumer won't have to pay for seven cable channels if you just want one. This is good. But, inevitably, some cable channels will suffer and will probably be whining at the CRTC to pry more money from the system. It all goes around and around. It's all about your money.
And then there's the matter of the Gemini Awards.
The awards thing for Canadian TV has now spread to four - count 'em, four - nights of handing out prizes, spread out over several months. The climax will be the Broadcast Gala, coming on Nov. 28 and broadcast on the E! network and Showcase. This is beyond ridiculous.
Thing is, see, a lot of people who work in Canadian television - producing, writing, directing and acting in Canadian-made TV - spend a lot of time complaining about the lack of attention they get. They complain about Canadian broadcasters making money from simulcasting U.S. network shows. They complain about everything. Yet, in the case of their own awards program, they are happy to let the thing roll out in relative obscurity. It seems to me that they're perfectly happy talking to each other, reading each other's blogs, whining and telling each other how great they are.
Here's a piece of advice - get out of the house, stop blogging and reading blogs for a while. Leave the Facebook pages alone for a few days. Go talk to people who watch TV, not just the ones who make it. You'll probably find that very few of them have heard of your shows. You might also find that they're willing to watch if they hear that the show is really great. And they know it's great if it gets awards and attention. So get cracking on fixing your awards show.
Corner Gas (CTV, 9:30 p.m.) is a repeat, but one of the more crazy episodes of the series. See, Hank has an idea to increase tourism to Dog River but this has consequences nobody could have foreseen. Oscar also has an idea but is afraid to bring it forward for fear of being labelled a crazy old man. Stuff happens and the newfound popularity of Dog River causes a business boom at Corner Gas and the Ruby Café. Next thing you know, Wanda is getting a weekly guest spot on a popular Canadian news program. Oh yeah, Seamus O'Regan and Beverly Thomson, co-hosts of Canada AM , make an appearance and even Hair in the Fridge Harper visits Dog River, to insert himself into a debate about prairie dogs and gophers.
Samantha Who? (ABC, A, 9:30 p.m.) is one of those sitcoms that just keeps going, without getting much attention. ABC recently decided to keep it on the air through the rest of this season, so it must be popular with a few million people. It has a good concept, and was partly created by romance novelist Cecilia Ahern, daughter of the former Irish prime minister Bertie Ahern, by the way. Christina Applegate plays Sam, a young woman who awakens from a coma suffering from amnesia and knowing nothing about herself and her family. To her chagrin, she comes to realize she wasn't a very nice person before the accident. She's still on the long road to niceness. Tonight, Samantha starts a real-estate business, but her handsome first client (guest star James Tupper, the hunky Jack from Men in Trees ) causes things to go awry. If that sounds like your bag, enjoy.
Check local listings.

Also airing tonight
Frontline: The Choice 2008 (PBS, 9 p.m.) is a repeat of Frontline 's two-hour, exhaustive look at the careers, backgrounds and policies of Barack Obama and John McCain. It being a Frontline production, it's totally even-handed but suffers a bit from being made before the recent financial turmoil changed the U.S. presidential race.
SNL Presidential Bash 2008 (NBC, Global, 9) has all the best bits from Saturday Night Live 's political coverage over the last few months. Maybe even a few new jokes. That is if it's even possible to create new Sarah Palin jokes.
Mr. and Mrs. bin Laden (Newsworld, 10 p.m., on The Passionate Eye ) is a BBC program about "a strange tale of love and lust." It's the story of the fourth son of Osama bin Laden and his marriage to a British grandmother twice his age. Yes, apparently a 51-year-old grandmother and five-time divorcee from Cheshire married a 26-year-old Saudi man who already had a wife and child himself. He is also the son of the world's most-wanted terrorist. J.D.

Full text:   The Architourist takes a self-guided tour through Sarasota's 'Disneyland' for fans of houses built in the mid-20th century
Mouse ears, outlet malls and gated, Spanish-style retirement communities coated with stucco. It's what usually comes to mind when 21st-century Canadians think of Central Florida.
The Central Florida of 50 and 60 years ago, however, was anything but. As in California, Florida's subtropical climate and open-minded attitude combined to create an elixir that was too tempting for modernist architects to resist.
One that succumbed early was Kentucky-born architect Paul Rudolph, after he graduated from Walter Gropius's Harvard graduate school of design in 1947. First partnering with Sarasota's Ralph Twitchell and then striking out on his own in 1952, Mr. Rudolph would design many small, sophisticated vacation homes, which, ultimately, would lead to bigger commissions and finally to his appointment as chairman of the department of architecture at Yale in 1957.
Thirty years later, in the 1980s, this early work and that of his Sarasota contemporaries - Mr. Twitchell, Victor Lundy, Tim Seibert, Jack West, Gene Leedy, Philip Hiss and others - would become known as the Sarasota school of architecture.
Parked in front of Mr. West's 1967 Sarasota City Hall in my rental Mustang a few weeks ago with my trusty navigator-wife, all thoughts of lime green golfing pants and talking mice were quickly dispelled. A muscular composition of rectilinear forms, city hall is the first stop on a self-driving tour created by local real estate agent and mid-century-modern aficionado Martie Lieberman.
Since I'd be staying a mere 45 minutes north of Sarasota for a little sun-and-fun vacation near St. Petersburg, I decided to e-mail Ms. Lieberman prior to my arrival to obtain a copy of her tour in PDF form, in order to print it out and pack it with my luggage. (Visit www.modernsarasota.com to request it for yourself.) Featuring approximately 100 properties that take about three hours to cover, it's a hefty tour for such a small city. While a lunch break and a few bottles of water are required, it's worth the effort, however, to witness how modernism moulded itself to the mangrove-rich landscape and dealt with hot, sticky temperatures before the widespread use of air conditioning.
Full-wall jalousies, large trellis-like shading systems (some bigger than the houses themselves!), bug-screened swimming pool enclosures (called "pool cages") and gigantic sliding window walls to allow Gulf winds to whisk away stale air were some of major techniques employed by the group.
Many of these can still be seen immediately following the city hall stop in the barrier island community of Lido Shores, which Ms. Lieberman writes is "a living museum of modern architecture." It is indeed, since dozens of examples of the school's early work remain. On Morningside Drive are homes by Hiss Associates, Seibert Architects, Mr. Rudolph, and more recent work by Carl Abbott (the 1986 Putterman Residence).
Unfortunately, very recent houses in this once untainted and secluded enclave usually take the form of McMansions. For instance, where the modernist house once occupied by Mr. Hiss and his family once stood on Westway Drive there are now two faux-château speculative homes that look alarmingly out of place. Luckily, across the street is the Hiss Studio/Library, preserved and ready for architourist eyes and cameras.
Also photoworthy, and just down the block, is Mr. Rudolph's Umbrella House of 1953. Ironically, the umbrella itself - a sheltering steel-and-wood frame superstructure that extended past the house to cover a patio and pool - blew off in a tropical storm just a few years after construction. (Plans may be in place to rebuild this; check www.umbrellahouse.com for updates.) Leaving Lido Shores for the mainland and passing condominiums and a Ford dealership by Mr. Seibert, a bank by Mr. West and Mr. Rudolph's much-ballyhooed 1958 Sarasota High School, we crossed the water again onto Siesta Key and arrived at two more landmark homes.
First is the Revere Quality House, designed by the Twitchell-Rudolph partnership in 1947 to showcase the products of Revere Copper and Brass Co. While the one-storey home has just undergone a massive restoration by new owners (who purchased it from Ms. Lieberman), the sacrifice is that it now lies buried under the weight of a massive three-storey addition that makes it look more like a breezeway or a garage.
One street over, we found Mr. Rudolph's 1955 Cohen House. Its ordered, slender columns and mathematically precise massing tries, unsuccessfully, to play down the tumultuous last half-dozen years it has endured. Despite two separate restorations (one by Ms. Lieberman), it still sits unsold.
After the tour, we met Ms. Lieberman at her own home, which, while not included in the tour, is another excellent example of the school's work. It's a long, sexy Seibert design built originally as a vacation home for Toronto economist and writer Tex Mitchell in 1960. (Any Globe Real Estate readers know anything about him?) Ms. Lieberman is part of a rare real estate breed - not only does she specialize in mid-century modern, she will go so far as to buy a place - as she did with the Cohen House - to save it from demolition and then look for the right buyer afterward.
Glossy informational cards for homes she represents often state: "Seller reserves right to reject offers with intent to destroy house."
We could use a few like her up here, where heritage protection laws often feel, frankly, rather Mickey Mouse.

Full text:   Waterscapes
LOCATION: Etobicoke
BUILDER/DEVELOPER: Monarch Corp.
SIZE: 480 to 1,605 square feet
PRICE: $189,990 to more than $1-million
CONTACT: To register, phone (416) 495-3544 or visit www.monarchgroup.net
With three towers built and a fourth under construction at its Waterview condo development in south Etobicoke, Monarch Corp. is set to unveil the fifth and final phase this month.
Completing the site on Marine Parade Drive, just south of Lake Shore Boulevard, the new elliptical-shaped, 30-storey building called Waterscapes will give residents views of Lake Ontario and downtown Toronto. It also will put them close to waterfront attractions such as marinas and the Martin Goodman Trail.
"We kept the best for last," says Linda Mitchell, high-rise sales and marketing vice-president for Monarch. "[Waterscapes] truly is the closest to the water of any of the projects you see on the market."
As the site is close to the Gardener Expressway and public transit, residents also will enjoy relatively easy access to the city core.
"It really is a great site in that it's only ten minutes from downtown," Ms. Mitchell says. "You're away from it all - out of the hustle-bustle - and you've got the best views the city has to offer."
In addition to the local collection of shops and other amenities, there will be retail and resort-style recreation facilities in Waterscape's four-storey, U-shaped podium.
A courtyard, eco-friendly green roof and rooftop retreat with a barbecue area are among the outdoor features.
Indoors, there will be a party room with a caterer's kitchen, bar and patio access; a theatre with cinema-style seating and surround sound; and a lounge with a billiards table.
The fitness facility will offer residents an indoor pool, hot tub, saunas, a gym with commercial-grade equipment, and areas for yoga and aerobics.
Amenities also includea 24-hour concierge, a business room, guest suites, a pet wash room and car wash bay.
Many of the features and finishes offered in the building's 345 units are showcased in a 1,090-square-foot model suite with two bedrooms and a den.
"The whole building is elliptical-shaped, so ... the living and dining room has ... curved floor-to-ceiling windows," Ms. Mitchell points out.
Ceilings are be nine feet high, flooring includes plank strip laminate as well as ceramic or porcelain tile, and balconies are six feet deep.
Contemporary kitchens will feature stainless-steel appliances, granite countertops and backsplashes in mosaic glass, ceramic or porcelain tile. Pantries, breakfast bars and islands with temperature-controlled wine fridges are also included.
Even the 480-square-foot, one-bedroom units will contain walk-in closets.
"The spaces have become smaller, but much more efficient," Ms. Mitchell explains. "It's a good opportunity for a first-time buyer to get into the home-buying market."
Energy-efficient features include double-glazed, low-E windows; individually controlled heat-pump systems for on-demand heating and air conditioning; Energy Star appliances; and paint with a low emission of volatile organic compounds.
Units come with parking. The monthly fee is 43 cents a square foot; hydro will be individually metered.
The tentative occupancy date is April, 2012.

Full text:   Steve Martin is asking $28,000 (U.S.) a week to rent out his villa on the Caribbean island of St. Barthelemy. The actor bought the house, which had been listed for $9-million, this past spring.
In the hills of Lurin, the house has four bedrooms and four full bathrooms, with a large deck and wide views of St. Jean Bay. Renovated in 2003, the home has a mixture of American and local furnishings. The half-acre property comes with a caretaker's house, a pool, a lily pond and a Balinese-style gazebo.
French-speaking St. Barts, in the Lesser Antilles about 200 kilometres north of Guadeloupe's main islands, is just 17 kilometres long and four kilometres wide. Mr. Martin, 63, rented the home last winter and purchased it this past spring "turnkey," including furnishings. The sale price wasn't disclosed.

Full text:   The Grand Residences at Parkside Village
Location: Mississauga
Builder/developer: Amacon
Size: 560 to 1,730 square feet
Price: $199,900 to the low $700,000s
Sales centre: 465 Burnhamthorpe Rd. West, at Confederation Parkway. Open Monday to Thursday, 1 to 7 p.m.; weekends, noon to 5 p.m.
Contact: (905) 273-9333 or www.lifeatparkside.com
Amacon is developing a 30-acre site in downtown Mississauga that will eventually include 18 high-rise towers and a handful of low-rise buildings.
Despite its size, the project at Burnhamthorpe Road and Confederation Parkway will be far from a concrete jungle, according to the builder.
Amacon says it aims to create a pedestrian-friendly community. Among other things, it will allot 2.5 acres for parkland and establish wide walkways.
To generate a vibrant street life, cafes and restaurants with patio seating, banks, salons and other commercial outlets will be incorporated into the base of the buildings.
"It's all the essentials of day-to-day life," says Debbie Cosic, a principal of In2ition Realty, which is handling marketing and sales for the project, called Parkside Village.
Nearly all of the 292 units in the first high-rise, a 36-storey tower launched in June, have been sold. The 45-storey second tower, called the Grand Residences, contains 450 suites, roughly 60 per cent of which have been purchased.
"[The] recreation of this urban village in a 905 neighbourhood has been phenomenally well received," Ms. Cosic says. The site is close to shops, restaurants and entertainment venues, GO Transit service, as well as Highway 403 and the QEW.
"It's a premier location for an urban lifestyle, and we really don't have that in the suburbs," Ms. Cosic says.
Residents within the first three towers - the third will be unveiled next year - will have access to 50,000 square feet of private amenities. There will be a show kitchen, wine bar and cellar, a "grand celebration" room, a music room, an Internet lounge and theatre, as well as a gym, indoor pool, hot tub and sauna.
The rooftop patio will feature a lounge with fireplace, barbecue and dining areas, gardens with trellis-covered seating, a playground, an area for dogs to run free and a large lawn.
"We also have green roofs, so when you look down onto a lower building or amenity area, you see expanses of green," she adds.
Units still available in the second tower measure between 560 and 1,020 square feet. Layouts range from one bedroom and two bedrooms with a den. Prices include a parking space and locker.
Models typically have balconies, combined living and dining areas and open kitchens with breakfast bars, granite countertops and appliances.
Among the other features are nine-foot ceilings in the principal rooms, engineered hardwood and porcelain tile flooring, Berber carpeting, imported marble bathroom countertops and deep soaker tubs.
Most penthouses - sized from 1,330 to 1,730 square feet - will have three bedrooms, and come with two parking spaces. They will feature 10-foot ceilings, electric fireplaces and stainless-steel appliances, including side-by-side refrigerators and a wall oven.
Construction waste will be kept to a minimum and local materials will be used, according to the builder. Utilities will be individually metered.
The monthly fee is 47 cents a square foot.
Occupancy is scheduled for spring, 2012.

Abstract: "We already have approval for 650 residential units at Port McNicoll and 1,000 at Horsehoe, but we are also looking at hotels, a commercial centre at Horseshoe Valley and the creation of four private clubs," says Gil Blutrich, Skyline's president who is also chairman of real estate firm Mishorim Group in Israel. "We will have one for boating, one for skiing, one for horseback riding and we will turn one of Horseshoe's two existing golf courses into a private club as well."

Full text:   Resort operators strive to have a year-round focus to attract clientele that increasingly is international in origin
Year-round recreation-based communities have started a slow but certain rise across Canada. And it's not just places for big-city folk to own a weekend getaway either. Canada's growing crop of ski, golf, boating and relaxing-surrounded-by-nature destinations are gaining favour with the international crowd - investors and holidayers alike.
In Newfoundland, there is the Humber Valley Resort, a 2,200-acre property being developed by British-based Newfound Property International . Regular flights into nearby Red Lake Airport ferry British tourists for a taste of rugged scenery enlivened by an 18-hole championship golf course, spa and gourmet restaurant.
In Quebec, the British have become the second-biggest group of buyers at Intrawest ULC's Mount Tremblant resort community. The Vancouver-based company also owns internationally recognized year-round resort communities at Blue Mountain, Ont., and Whistler, B.C.
Late this summer, Skyline International Developments Inc. of Toronto announced it too would be creating its own version of a resort and recreation community. The company already owns more than 800 acres on Georgian Bay at Port McNicoll and in August bought the nearby Horseshoe Valley ski resort. It plans to turn both into a single year-round destination.
"We are starting to see the emergence of Canadian destination-based, year-round resorts, which have great appeal to the British and Germans especially," says Joel Rosen, chairman of Horwath FTL, a leisure industries consultant, which has worked with some of the new communities.
"There now seems to be a number of new entrants that are modelling themselves after Intrawest, which has been enormously successful in that area. What they share is a primary appeal to a local market and then building on that to attract foreign buyers and vacationers."
The existing and planned communities can be split into two distinct categories, Mr. Rosen says. There are those such as Mount Tremblant and Whistler built on a well-established local destination - in both cases ski hills - and those trying to create a destination almost from scratch, such as Humber Valley in western Newfoundland and Skyline's venture south of Georgian Bay.
What sets them apart from standard cottage country developments is their focus on becoming a destination much like Orlando in Florida. These communities offer not only a broad range of winter and summer activities but throw in shopping, restaurants, hotels and sometimes even live theatre and a casino.
Mount Tremblant is a prime example, says Steve Lafave, director of sales for Intrawest at Tremblant.
"We acquired it in 1991 and started expanding in 1993. To date, we have built 2,800 housing units, 130,000 square feet of hotel space and 40,000 square feet of commercial and retail.
"We have also just added convention space and a $65-million casino. We get 2.5 million visitors during high season. The challenge now is to beef up shoulder season [spring and fall] traffic."
Mount Tremblant even has its own airport with daily flights from Toronto and regular flights connecting with New York. "Brits have become our second-biggest market," Mr. Lafave says.
At Skyline, the goal now is to decide how best to develop, market and integrate not just Port McNicoll, with its boating, fishing and water sports, and Horseshoe, with its ski hills and 35 kilometres of trails, but also the company's two five-star Toronto hotels and spas - the Pantages Suites and the Cosmopolitan.
"We already have approval for 650 residential units at Port McNicoll and 1,000 at Horsehoe, but we are also looking at hotels, a commercial centre at Horseshoe Valley and the creation of four private clubs," says Gil Blutrich, Skyline's president who is also chairman of real estate firm Mishorim Group in Israel. "We will have one for boating, one for skiing, one for horseback riding and we will turn one of Horseshoe's two existing golf courses into a private club as well."
One of the immediate goals will be to give each community its own sense of being a village with new commercial and retail development, hotels and other amenities, says Rob Spanier, senior business development manager at Live Work Learn Play LLP, the consulting firm Skyline has retained to help with planning.
"Once we have worked out the details of creating distinct communities, then the next task is deciding how to brand them as a single destination."
That may be a far more challenging task, Mr. Rosen says. "Unlike Mount Tremblant and Whistler, this is essentially a greenfields project. Few have ever heard of Port McNicoll. Branding Horseshoe and Port McNicoll as a single destination must also overcome geography; the two are at least a 20-minute drive apart."
It is, however, too early for predictions about success, he adds. "What I can say is I know Gil well and he is a very clever fellow and a canny businessman and the time may indeed be right for a recreation-based destination-style community like this."

Abstract: Echoing the optimistic outlook of other leaders, Sultan Nasser al-Suweidi, the UAE's central bank governor, said yesterday that the liquidity crunch in the region's banking system was easing and soon the region's economies would return to normal. "Things are getting better and stabilizing," he said.

Full text:   Oil-fuelled wealth proves to be only thin insulation against the effects of the global credit crunch
For British soccer fans, it seemed too good to be true: Zabeel Investments, a Dubai-based sovereign wealth fund, was looking to buy Charlton Athletic, a struggling soccer club mired in more than $30-million (U.S.) of debt.
But late last week, Zabeel suddenly pulled out, blaming the toxic economic climate in the West. The company had decided to focus on "domestic opportunities" instead.
If soccer fans in Britain were shattered, the mood in Dubai was shock. The deal's collapse was one of the most striking signs the party in this oil-rich region was over: State-owned investment vehicles had sobered up, suddenly shunning trophy assets like Charlton.
In the past few weeks, Persian Gulf states have been jolted by the realization that they are not immune to the financial turmoil gripping the globe. Oil-fuelled wealth proved to be only thin insulation against the effects of the credit crunch.
More than $50-billion of foreign deposits has fled the region's banks in recent weeks as investors pulled back.
The price of oil - this region's main export and source of income - plunged, and local stock markets sank to new lows.
Gulf states have had to retrench, with Kuwait moving to prop up its central bank and Saudi Arabia extending special credit to its neediest citizens over the weekend.
The United Arab Emirates has already acted to guarantee bank deposits, and injected billions of dollars into its domestic money markets to encourage interbank lending. Qatar and Kuwait have used their sovereign wealth to buy up stakes in ailing banks and slumping stock.
"It feels a little like we've all woken up in the Twilight Zone," said Jason Goff, head of treasury sales at Emirates NBD.
"People are scared. Nobody in a million years predicted this would happen here," he added.
Economists are scaling back growth forecasts, and the Gulf's once-giddy property market is showing signs of shakiness, with developers now openly talking about construction delays and cancellations as fear spreads, paralyzing buyers.
Property developers have scaled back recruitment, with some companies imposing unprecedented hiring freezes until the economy stabilizes. Credit Suisse said market turmoil and negative sentiment would likely dent property demand in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, while Morgan Stanley predicts a market downturn of at least 10 per cent by 2010.
"These economies are no longer islands unto themselves," said Dr. Henry Azzam, chief executive officer of Deutsche Bank, Middle East and North Africa, and a former economics professor at Beirut University.
"Economic integration with the West brings with it a level of exposure. It forces a certain degree of reflection on how to move forward."
For the region's rulers, the need to take drastic steps to stabilize markets is unprecedented. Gulf leaders tend to view themselves as mavericks, building skyscrapers in the middle of the desert and man-made islands in the middle of the ocean, all in an effort to attract foreign investment and diversify their economies away from oil wealth.
The strategy has so far worked in countries like the United Arab Emirates, which has boasted double-digit growth in the past five years. Only in the past month have the hidden costs of that progress been revealed.
As Gulf states refocus their resources domestically, there is dwindling interest in acquiring assets in the West, even at fire sale prices.
"Anything in the West is seen as toxic," Dr. Azzam said. "They are not going to be the ones to bail out the banks any more. It's just not worth it," he said.
Foreign assets of Gulf Co-operation Council states were estimated to top $1-trillion last year. Some funds have seen their existing investments suffer massive losses.
The Kuwait Investment Authority's investment in Citigroup last January shows a $270-million loss.
To be sure, Gulf states are in a far better position to survive financial turbulence than the West.
Even though oil prices have dropped, countries including Saudi Arabia, Abu Dhabi and gas-rich Qatar have deep reserves of savings to cushion their countries from any real devastation.
Dubai is still viewed as a refuge for worried professionals, whose jobs are quickly evaporating in Western financial capitals. Some recruitment companies have reported a tenfold jump in applications in the past two months with bankers and estate agents leading the charge.
Gulf leaders and central bankers remain self-assured, arguing that their economies are fundamentally sound and able to withstand the current turmoil.
Echoing the optimistic outlook of other leaders, Sultan Nasser al-Suweidi, the UAE's central bank governor, said yesterday that the liquidity crunch in the region's banking system was easing and soon the region's economies would return to normal. "Things are getting better and stabilizing," he said.
But confidence alone won't calm markets, analysts say, and some suggest a co-ordinated action plan among Gulf states is needed to address the region's problems.
For now, leaders appear to be waiting to see if things get worse.
"If there is a need, we will do more," Mr. al-Suweidi said.
*****
Gimme shelter
As the financial crisis creeps into the Middle East, here's what others countries did yesterday to shore up battered markets.
The U.S. Treasury Department started moving $125-billion (U.S.) to nine major banks by buying ownership stakes, the first big transfer since the $700-billion bailout was passed this month.
Australia's central bank took the rare step of buying Australian dollars twice in the past few days to limit their plunge.
Crisis-hit Iceland said it needs another $4-billion in loans on top of the $2-billion it wants from the IMF .
Japan's Prime Minister Taro Aso told senior officials to draw up steps to calm volatile markets and to fend off further fallout.

Full text:   MacDonald Dettwiler and Associates Ltd. says it has signed a contract worth more than $6-million with space company EADS Astrium for a satellite antenna system.
The Vancouver area company, also known as MDA, said it will provide EADS Astrium, Eutelsat KA-SAT's prime contractor, with four transmit and receive antennas, which will provide the satellite's multiple gateway and user beams.
Eutelsat is one of the world's leading satellite operators.
It will use KA-SAT for consumer broadband services across Europe, North Africa and the Middle East as well as for local, regional and HD broadcast services.
Earlier this month, MDA said it signed a $10-million contract with EADS Astrium to provide a high-power satellite antenna feed for the Alphasat spacecraft, one of the world's largest telecommunications satellites.
It also received more than $10-million (U.S.) in contract amendments from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration to upgrade its Instrument Procedure Development System, which modernizes flight route design practices and harmonizes military and civilian air navigation.
In May, Ottawa blocked MDA's proposed sale of its space division, which includes the Radarsat-2 satellite, to Alliant Techsystems Inc. for $1.325-billion in cash.
The federal government said the proposed deal would not benefit the country.
Critics of Ottawa's decision said the sale was necessary because space spending in Canada had dried up, and in part blamed the federal government.
MDA said publicly that it wanted to sell the division to focus on expanding its faster-growing information products business, which makes software for the real estate sector.
Last month, MDA warned earnings will be lower as a result of the uncertain housing and lending environment in Britain.

Global crisis roils Gulf

Author: Coker, Margaret; Cummins, Chip

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/global-crisis-roils-gulf/docview/382683567/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Much of the Gulf has budgeted for much lower oil prices. Gulf states, on average, need prices above $47 a barrel to keep from running budget deficits.

Full text:   Kuwait bails out one of its largest banks in sign oil-rich region not immune from harm
The global financial storm rolled across the Persian Gulf yesterday, as Kuwait's central bank guaranteed bank deposits and cobbled together a hasty bailout for one of the country's largest banks.
The Kuwait intervention is the first bank rescue in the oil-rich Gulf, which until now had seemed relatively immune to the current crisis. It came as local markets across the region continued their steep selloffs. With oil prices down more than 50 per cent from their July highs, the explosive, petroleum-fuelled growth of the Gulf now looks suddenly vulnerable at the same time as international and local investors are pulling back sharply.
Saudi Arabia, in an apparent bid to ease the fallout of the global credit crisis on its citizens, said it would funnel some $2.3-billion (U.S.) in loans to low-income borrowers. And in Dubai, real estate brokers in the Mideast boomtown said they are seeing signs of price weakness for the first time in years, as financing dries up and speculators bow out of the once red-hot market.
For months, the Gulf appeared largely immune to some of the worst fallout from the housing, credit and banking crisis that has rippled from the U.S. across Europe and Latin America and into parts of Asia.
Several governments even took dramatic pre-emptive moves, funnelling billions of dollars of cash into their relatively small but liquidity-starved banking systems. Earlier this month, Saudi Arabia promised $40-billion in lending facilities to banks that needed cash. The United Arab Emirates pledged a sweeping three-year guarantee on domestic bank accounts.
None of the moves reassured the region's equity investors. In recent weeks, they have followed international investors out of the Gulf's handful of stock markets, which earlier this year were some of the best-performing among emerging markets. Sharp falls in the price of oil have also rattled confidence here.
While prices are still high enough to provide generous budget surpluses for most of the Gulf's petroleum-dependent governments, the prospect of further falls has spooked investors.
Much of the Gulf has budgeted for much lower oil prices. Gulf states, on average, need prices above $47 a barrel to keep from running budget deficits. But some states are more vulnerable than others: Bahrain's so-called breakeven price is $75 a barrel, compared with Saudi Arabia's $49 and Kuwait's $33, according to the International Monetary Fund.
The speed of crude's tumble has unnerved officials despite the apparent cushion. At an emergency meeting on Friday, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries hastily decided to cut output by 1.5 million barrels a day, the biggest single cut in almost eight years.
Weeks of sliding equity prices have wiped out billions of dollars of wealth for the region's influential clique of local retail investors. Saudi Arabia's main stock-market index is down by more than 50 per cent year to date. The fall has wiped some $205-billion of value off the region's biggest exchange by market capitalization since June.
Yesterday, Kuwaiti traders staged their second stock exchange walkout in as many trading days. (Kuwait's market is closed on Fridays and Saturdays.) They demanded more state intervention in the markets to prop up share prices. The chief executive officer of the National Bank of Kuwait, Ibrahim Dabdoub, called on authorities yesterday to close the exchange altogether.
High oil prices have allowed state and private investors across the Gulf to funnel billions of dollars into red-hot property markets, infrastructure projects and, more recently, foreign-exchange speculation. In particular, many foreign and local investors earlier in the summer made speculative currency trades, betting that regional governments would drop their currency pegs with the greenback to help tame rising domestic inflation.
International investors rushed out of those trades late in the summer and early last month when it was clear governments weren't going to act.
That left many banks strapped for cash, so they scrambled to make new loans. When international borrowing seized up last month, the region found itself stuck in its own credit crunch.
But it was currency trades - not bad loans - that plunged Kuwait into a banking bailout yesterday. Gulf Bank said defaults by counterparties on bad euro-dollar derivatives contracts forced the bank to seek government intervention.
Gulf Bank, which has assets of $18-billion, and the government declined to disclose the size of the bank's trading losses, but industry estimates in Kuwait were above $700-million. The government yesterday appointed a state supervisor for the bank's operations, suspended trading in the bank's stock and opened an investigation.

Full text:   New law bans unlicensed contractors; Electrical Safety Authority investigates over 1,500 complaints since last year
It's a treat to find someone who is truly passionate about their work. This was the case when I spoke with Lucy Impera, the registrar for licensing and certification at the Electrical Safety Authority, a non-profit Ontario organization dedicated to protecting the public.
For Ms. Impera, this is more than a job - it's personal, in large part because about 12 years ago she almost lost her brother to an electrical accident. He was tinkering with some wiring at home and was jolted 14 feet across the room.
Saving others from a similar or worse fate is the ESA's mission, and the need for this protection is evident in the latest figures from the Ontario Fire Marshal's office. Between 2002 and 2006, residents of the province suffered 15,000 electrical fires, one third of which were directly related to residential electrical systems.
Most of the time, electrical accidents happen because the person doing the wiring isn't qualified to do the work. Sometimes they occur even when a qualified and licensed person is involved because someone previously tinkered with the wiring and set up a potentially deadly booby trap.
To counteract this loss of life and property, Ontario passed a law that came into effect Jan. 1, 2007, making it illegal for homeowners to hire someone who is not a licensed electrical contractor to do such work. And it is illegal for an unlicensed person to do the work, or to advertise that they do residential electrical work.
But don't use this law as an excuse to take on these jobs yourself. Going that route could kill or maim you.
Ms. Impera says a common challenge to this advice is, "How hard can it be to change an outlet?" Her response is, "An electrical outlet that costs 69 cents looks the same as one that costs more than $4 but they have different ratings. One is intended for copper wiring only, the other for aluminum and copper.
If you don't know what your home's electrical system consists of - aluminum or copper - and you try to install the wrong outlet, you could be in trouble."
You also can't always know what hazards have been left behind by previous residents of your home. For example, say you want to install a new light fixture on the dining room ceiling and you've turned off the power to that junction box to do so. If that light fixture was wired incorrectly originally, the power may not actually be off and you could electrocute yourself.
Or, say that, unbeknownst to you, the light fixture you're dealing with is a three-way device (controlled by more than one switch). The wiring for that sort of fixture is more complex. Couple confusing wiring with the fact that the power may still be on even though you think it's off and you have an even greater chance of getting hurt or killed.
Ms. Impera offers the following tips to make you an informed, well-prepared consumer:
* Be specific about your renovation plans. Tell your electrical contractor what power-consuming equipment and fixtures you plan to install, both immediately and in the future. This will allow your contractor to test whether your existing system can accommodate the added load - both immediate and anticipated - and, if the system isn't adequate, install the necessary components to make it safe.
* Know in advance where you plan to locate things that draw power, such as appliances, the TV and table lamps. That way your contractor can ensure there's a permanent, separately wired outlet installed exactly where you need it. This level of planning also ensures that you won't be using extension cords. They should be used only in temporary situations, such as plugging in holiday lights, because it's been proven they heat up and fail over time, creating a hazard. This is especially true if they're running underneath carpet, or near furniture that can damage them.
While the message is getting out, unqualified contractors continue to try to dupe homeowners into hiring them. Since the law took effect in Ontario, the ESA has responded to 1,508 complaints, conducted 1,378 inspections and issued 823 fines to unlicensed operators. The fines are serious, ranging from $200 to $10,000. If injuries or fatalities occur, the offender could face a fine of $50,000 or more, and possibly a prison term.
There may be someone near you trying to pass himself off as qualified and licensed, so know how to protect yourself. To confirm if someone is legally qualified to do electrical work in Ontario, ask for their licence number and then check it out at www.pluginsafely.ca or phone 1-877-ESA-SAFE (1-877-372-7233).
There are 6,000 licensed electrical contractors in Ontario. The above website and phone number can be used to locate those working in your area.
In other provinces, contact your provincial ministry of labour or local utility company to find out if an equivalent licensing organization or requirements exist.

Abstract: A report prepared for SmartCentres, which is Wal-Mart's real estate partner, found that 83 per cent of Stratford residents have already shopped at a Wal-Mart, and 28 per cent had shopped at Wal-Mart within the previous month. But they have to drive 30 to 40 minutes to get to the closest Wal-Mart.

Full text:   When Wal-Mart sets up shop, local economies get a kick start - though smaller businesses often need to refocus
Liz Westman had reason to be anxious when Wal-Mart set up shop in Okotoks, Alta., in late 2002. Within a year of the giant discounter opening at the other end of town, sales at her home decor store dipped almost 10 per cent. It was the classic so-called Wal-Mart effect: Business began to shift to the newcomer and away from the town's main street, where her store is located. Ms. Westman, however, responded swiftly.
She ditched products in her store that were also carried at Wal-Mart, such as picture frames and candles. Instead, she returned to her shop's higher end roots of custom window coverings and one-of-a-kind sofas and chairs. Sales at Homeworks Custom Interiors recovered, and have since doubled to about $1-million a year, she says.
Now she and other Okotoks merchants are steeling themselves for the next onslaught. As it is doing in communities across Canada, Wal-Mart is dramatically expanding its Okotoks store, transforming it into a Supercentre with an even wider array of home furnishings and other items, and a full supermarket. The move comes just as retailers across Canada brace for what could be the toughest holiday season in two decades amid the global financial meltdown.
"I think there's a little bit of concern when Wal-Mart comes," Ms. Westman says. "It does worry a small town when it happens ... But we probably needed a kick in the pants, and to refocus."
Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, forces rivals to pull up their socks and differentiate their offerings from it. The discounter invariably attracts an array of other big-box merchants to spots close to it, and its low prices and wide array of products draw shoppers from surrounding neighbourhoods.
The discounter can also create sterile-looking shopping pods at a city's outskirts, sucking life out of a community's downtown. It is often the anchor for a power centre that is dotted with big box outlets in vast parking lots.
Even so, the entry of Wal-Mart into a market pinches less than 10 per cent of local stores' business, says Paul McElhone, associate director of the retailing school at the University of Alberta's School of Business.
"As bad as it is, these are often marginal businesses anyway," Prof. McElhone says. "When Wal-Mart comes to town, it makes other businesses better."
ROOTED IN GROWTH
Okotoks, which has restored its old-style main street look, is typical of the type of place that Wal-Mart targets. Crowned in the 2006 census as Canada's second-fastest growing mid-sized community, Okotoks's population has doubled since the beginning of the decade to about 20,000 - and is expected to reach 30,000 by 2015.
Its youthful population (average age: 32) is attractive to Wal-Mart because young people make more purchases than older consumers do. And the burst of housing construction is appealing because new homeowners buy more.
After Wal-Mart arrived, other big-box retailers soon followed, along with new restaurants and shops. Today, Okotoks officials estimate about 50 new shops, eateries and professional offices have come to town, while only a few closed.
Still, in the early part of the decade, local merchants' concerns about the new competitor's impact prompted the town to draft a downtown renewal plan. It poured $6-million into planting trees, widening sidewalks and creating a central plaza around an old clock as a gathering place.
Many downtown shops went through their own rejuvenations. A picture frame store is being converted to an art gallery. Upscale restaurants, antique shops and home decor boutiques have sprung up. People from outside of Okotoks flood into town to shop. Last month, another retailer - Home Depot - opened, anchoring another shopping development several blocks from Wal-Mart.
"Certainly we have seen a change in the types of businesses that have come here," says Shane Olson, the town's economic development team leader. In his late 20s, he moved to Okotoks from Ontario more than two years ago with his wife just before their daughter was born. They shop at Wal-Mart for children's necessities. "Wal-Mart has some of the most competitive prices on these sorts of things."
But the couple shop elsewhere too, and studies have found that other retailers cash in from Wal-Mart's presence.
According to one of the more comprehensive studies on the subject, retailers' sales rose faster in districts with Wal-Mart stores - an average of 27.2 per cent - compared with areas without the discounter, where sales grew 18.6 per cent. The research, done for the Centre for the Study of Commercial Activity at Ryerson University, was conducted from 1994 (when Wal-Mart arrived in Canada) to 1998.
Today, Wal-Mart continues to forge ahead with its expansion, even as many competitors hold back in the tighter times, spokesman Kevin Groh says. The retailer will invest "hundreds of millions of dollars" in local economies through more than 25 new or expanded stores in the next year alone, he says.
SPEED BUMPS
Not all communities have been as welcoming to Wal-Mart as Okotoks.
Guelph, Ont., waged a decade-long battle against the discounter's bid to build a $20-million store before it was approved. Rival retailers, residents and even a Jesuit group were among the opponents. But the outlet, which opened in late 2006, performed so well that now Wal-Mart is expanding it into a Supercentre with a full grocery section (a plan that also drew objections).
In Stratford, Ont., home of the Shakespeare theatre festival, Wal-Mart is embroiled in another skirmish. The town has rejected its request for a store and the matter is to be appealed at the Ontario Municipal Board in January.
A report prepared for SmartCentres, which is Wal-Mart's real estate partner, found that 83 per cent of Stratford residents have already shopped at a Wal-Mart, and 28 per cent had shopped at Wal-Mart within the previous month. But they have to drive 30 to 40 minutes to get to the closest Wal-Mart.
And when residents shop at Wal-Mart in nearby communities, they often spend money there at other businesses too, which is a loss to Stratford, Mr. Groh says.
Still, Stratford Mayor Dan Mathieson insists that most residents don't want the discounter. "The community is very much pro-development as long as we continue to meet the unique characteristics of our town, which is heritage conservation and preservation of architecture."
FULL SPEED AHEAD
Since late 2006, Wal-Mart Canada has been rolling out its Supercentres, a retail format that wreaked havoc on the U.S. supermarket sector when introduced in 1988.
Unable to match Wal-Mart's low costs, economies of scale and clout with suppliers, dozens of grocers were pushed out of business. But survivors, such as Kroger Co., became stronger.
In Canada, Supercentres have already forced rivals to make changes. Now retailers have the added strain of operating in uncertain economic times, which tends to benefit Wal-Mart's low-price formula.
In Okotoks, as Wal-Mart prepares to expand its store, rivals are not standing still. Home Depot is drawing customers by touting its broad range of energy-efficient and environmentally friendly products, says Peter Vernon, a Home Depot district manager.
And it tries to take advantage of Wal-Mart's popularity, he says. "The more traffic in the area, the more opportunity we have to drive people into our stores, and the better off we're going to be."
But existing grocers will feel the heat when Wal-Mart introduces more food, Prof. McElhone says. Loblaw Cos. Ltd. has responded by converting its local Extra Foods into its successful No Frills discounter format. Sobeys, the second-largest chain in Canada after Loblaw with a supermarket next to Okotoks's Wal-Mart, is luring customers with a fresh-food focus and new loyalty program.
Ms. Westman feels her store has distinctive enough offerings to be shielded from the Supercentre assault. She's a loyal Sobeys shopper, but thinks she may venture down Wal-Mart's grocery aisles if tougher times start to pinch her business.
"It doesn't hurt that it's one-stop shopping," she says. "As the weather gets colder, that's appealing. Sobeys is going to have to work really hard to keep its customers."

Full text:   Vancouver officials are watching closely as a financial deadline comes up today for the U.S. lender that is backing the construction of the city's Olympic athletes village.
Fortress Investment Group, which has provided the $750-million loan to local company Millennium Developments to build the 1,100-unit village, is facing a $1.7-billion loan of its own coming due today.
That loan is related to Fortress's purchase of Intrawest two years ago. The Whistler ski resort, where many of the 2010 Olympics events will be held, is one of Intrawest's key assets - all of which makes Fortress's financial health of extreme interest in both Vancouver and Whistler.
But Ken Bayne, Vancouver's general manager of business planning, said Fortress officials have assured the city that the athletes village is on track, despite news media stories about its other financial issues.
The story about the Fortress loan related to Whistler dominated local news this week, after the Financial Times in London reported that the loan was coming due and that Fortress was having difficulty refinancing it.
Mr. Bayne said the company has assured Vancouver that "whatever issues are being reported are not affecting their commitment to this project."
Asked whether the city is monitoring Fortress's overall situation, Mr. Bayne said: "Yes, absolutely we are."
He also confirmed that nothing has changed in the agreement the city has with Millennium.
This is despite much speculation in the past three weeks that the city might be asked to provide a guarantee for an additional loan from Fortress to Millennium.
There had been discussions among Vancouver, Millennium and Fortress in the past several months about construction-cost overruns.
Those discussions grew intense when it became clear that Millennium would need to get an additional contingency reserve - similar to a line of credit - to cover up to $65-million in potential extra costs.
As the calendar neared Oct. 14, the date of Millennium's monthly draw from Fortress, there were almost daily discussions about the conditions for that draw and for any contingency reserve, with suggestions that the city might be asked to provide a guarantee for the additional financing.
That prompted concern from some city councillors about whether the public was getting enough information on the deal and about the potential for local taxpayers being on the hook for extra costs.
It's been difficult to get complete information on the discussions because they have been held in private council sessions.
Councillors have been warned that they face repercussions if they talk publicly about the details.
Mr. Bayne said the city's business team - which includes the finance department, real estate department head Michael Flanigan and deputy city manager Jody Andrews - is continuing those discussions, but that there has been no change to the city's guarantees.
The city had already provided a $190-million guarantee two years ago for the original loan.
This was part of the complex arrangement needed for a project where the city has the legal requirement to deliver it to VANOC but a private developer is actually building it.
The city continues to hold legal title to the land while Millennium builds the massive project, which includes condos, shops, a community centre and a daycare.
The city retained the land title in order to be able to take over the project in a worst-case scenario.
Mr. Bayne said the city has to publicly report when it provides those kinds of guarantees because of requirements from its auditor.
"That is important to the city's financial condition.
"If there is any change to the arrangement, that means a change to the city's risk and it would need to be reported."

[Debra Messing] is plausible as a woman who finally sees through the Hollywood flim-flammery and just wants a good deal more honesty and authenticity in her life. (Mind you, if the thing was to be truly plausible, she'd just skedaddle from Los Angeles.) And there is much sending up of inside-showbiz pretensions. [Molly Kagan], who used to write books for children, goes to a writers' group to help kick-start her inspiration.

Full text: There's a bit of rhyme in the Gaelic that translates as this: If I had a wife/ The scold of me life/ I'll tell you what I would do/ I'd buy her a boat and put her afloat/ And paddle me own canoe.
This is relevant. Honestly, it is.
The Starter Wife (Showcase, 10 p.m.) is a perky new series about an ex-missus named Molly Kagan (Debra Messing) who is put afloat in the shark-infested waters of Hollywood. It is that fact alone - the Hollywood setting - that raises The Starter Wife above a thousand other chick-lit excursions into the redemptive experience of getting dumped by a rat of a husband, then finding personal independence and sleeping with other fellas.
The series is derived from a miniseries that aired on the USA network some time back (which was based in turn on the bestselling book by one Gigi Levangie Grazer), but you don't have to have seen it to get the gist. The fun is in the gentle mockery of all things Hollywood - the religious and dieting fads, the absurd and arcane consumerism. And also, of course, in the name-dropping. Gentle Tom Cruise jokes, that sort of thing, and, if you're really into celebrity gossip, you're probably going to be guessing which real stars some of the characters are based on.
If you're not totally celeb-obsessed, you'll still enjoy it. Debra Messing is plausible as a woman who finally sees through the Hollywood flim-flammery and just wants a good deal more honesty and authenticity in her life. (Mind you, if the thing was to be truly plausible, she'd just skedaddle from Los Angeles.) And there is much sending up of inside-showbiz pretensions. Molly, who used to write books for children, goes to a writers' group to help kick-start her inspiration. The scene in which her fellow writers read from their works in progress is truly hilarious.
Besides the Messing character, the dominant figure is Judy Davis as Joan McAllister, a recovering alcoholic who is reduced to doing low-paying jobs to restore her dignity. Davis goes at the role with gusto, as if channelling some personal inner contempt for Hollywood. (She won an Emmy for the same role in the original miniseries.)
Not much that's very serious or original is going on, but there's a lot of zest and it's clear that everybody involved is enjoying the fun.
The new-romance storylines are a bit predictable. Molly's new boyfriend is the handsome, mysterious writing coach Zach (Hart Bochner), a too-obvious counterpoint to her shallow ex-husband. And Joan seems determined to link up with an appalling, drug-addled rock star. Still, The Starter Wife is well-made froth, not as clever as it thinks, rather conformist, but capable of soaring into exceptional comedy.
The fifth estate (CBC, 9 p.m.) is a true crime story tonight. Called The Girl in Saskatoon , it's about the brutal rape and killing, in May, 1962, of a young Saskatoon nurse and former beauty queen, Alexandra Wiwcharuk. Her killer was never found. The case has grown to prominence again, first because it was reopened as a cold case a few years ago, in the hope that new technology could help solve it. Also, Wiwcharuk's four nieces, who were little girls when their aunt was killed, have begun their own campaign to track down the person responsible.
Here, as Linden MacIntyre reports, these women are grimly determined and getting cautious support from the police. No, you won't find out who committed the crime. This isn't an episode of Cold Case or CSI . It's about the trauma to the local community inflicted by the killing and about how such a case can never be forgotten.
Check local listings.

Also airing tonight
STYLISTA (The CW, CITY-TV, 9 p.m.) is a new, horrid little reality series, a riff on Ugly Betty and The Devil Wears Prada . A bunch of silly young people compete to get a job as an assistant at that bastion of the culture, Elle magazine. The idea is that they must please the terrifying and repugnantly flippant fashion news editor Anne Slowey. Allowed to be utterly obnoxious and self-absorbed, she has a whale of a time. Along with Elle's creative director, Joe Zee, Slowey treats the contestants with contempt and behaves in the sort of manner that would get her fired from most companies. Meanwhile, the contestants are hopelessly giddy, bitchy and devoted to backstabbing.
THE REAL DONNIE BRASCO (History, 9 p.m.) is all about Joe Pistone, who spent six years as an undercover agent infiltrating the mob. Eventually, of course, his mob alter ego - wise guy Donnie Brasco - became very famous, thanks to Pistone's bestselling book and the movie it spawned. Here we get the no-frills guide to the famous sting operation that resulted in dozens of convictions, including many mob bosses.
INDEPENDENT LENS: CHICAGO 10 (PBS, 9 p.m.) is an outstanding start to a new Independent Lens season. It is filmmaker Brett Morgen's raucous and vivid take on the bizarre trial that followed protests outside the 1968 Democratic National Convention. Using animation, old news footage, court transcripts and a lot of music, the doc is both mocking and rueful about a strange time in recent American history. What happened at the trial was grotesque - Bobby Seale, the Black Panther member, was tried separately after he became sarcastic in court, and then the group's two lawyers were also jailed for contempt of court. The trial was part theatre and part nasty politics and, in this retelling, it still resonates today. J.D.

Abstract: Indian stocks have plunged, shedding about half their value from the peak of last January. Foreign funds have sold more than $11-billion (U.S.) in Indian stocks, after purchasing a record $17.4-billion in 2007. The Indian rupee is down sharply too, making it costly for the country to import oil despite the recent fall in the global price. Airlines, with their high fuel costs, have suffered as a result.

Full text: With global economies hurtling toward recession, Brazil is getting its nose bloodied. But the onetime basket case of international finance may yet emerge as a champion
In the heart of the one of this city's most notorious slums, seventeen-year-old Henrique Souza Machado proudly scratches out the famous samba, Ensaboa Mulata , along with three other members of the Cartola Petrobras Violin Orchestra.
Two years ago, Henrique was living on the streets of the Mangueira slum, or favela , with his drug-addicted mother. He was rescued by workers from the Cartola Cultural Centre. Now, Henrique lives with a worker from the centre, attends school and plays in the after-school orchestra, which is sponsored by Brazil's state-owned oil company, Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras).
As an economic boom propelled Brazil to new levels of prosperity over the past five years, even those on the lowest rung of South America's most inequitable society saw their lot improve. The country finally appeared to be shaking off its long, sad history of underperformance in the global economy.
Corporations like Petrobras poured hundreds of millions of dollars into social spending. The government of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, the former street vendor and union leader who took power in 2003, boosted spending on programs for the poor, and raised government income payments.
For Henrique and his friends in the orchestra, the increased support and stronger job market has meant a better opportunity to escape the grinding poverty and drug-fuelled violence of the favela . And it means brighter prospects that many here believe will not be dimmed by the current economic crisis, despite the country's perennial image as the land of the future.
This is a new, more resilient Brazil, and perhaps a BRIC bloc that will not only survive the financial turmoil, but emerge even stronger relative to the economic leaders of the last century.
As the credit crisis deepened earlier this year, many forecasters argued that the global economy would be rescued by high-growth emerging markets, led by the nations known collectively as BRIC: Brazil, Russia, India and China.
It's now clear that those countries - home to 2.76 billion people and $7-trillion (U.S.) of economic output - will not escape the storm that is pounding their largest export markets and drying up the foreign investment that helped fuel their growth. Share prices on the Sao Paulo stock exchange have collapsed - particularly for state-controlled resources giants like Petrobras and Companhia Vale do Rio Doce (Vale) - and the exchange halted trading four times in the past two weeks because of 10-per-cent losses on its Bovespa index.
But there is confidence that, for the first time during a crisis, the emerging markets will help stoke the world's flagging economy, rather than drag it down. In fact, the economic gloom now dominant in North America and Europe is leavened in the BRIC countries by a sense that, in the long term, they will hold the key economic cards.
At a meeting of finance ministers and central bankers in Washington last weekend, Brazilian Finance Minister Guido Mantega told of how governments in major developing countries are seeking to provide some cushion for a global economy reeling from the slump in the industrialized world.
Mr. Mantega, who chairs the Group of 20 forum for developed and emerging economies, told the other officials that his country, along with others, is moving to boost its domestic demand.
"The emerging countries will grow faster" than advanced economies, Mr. Mantega said. "And it will be up to the emerging countries to carry out countercyclical policies to maintain a certain level of world economic growth, to somehow neutralize the drop in economic growth in the advanced countries."
Most economists - including those at the International Monetary Fund - still forecast the fast-growing countries will continue their upward trajectory, and that this would provide a much-needed boost to global growth.
In fact, the IMF expects that virtually all the world's economic growth next year will occur outside of Europe, North America and Japan. While advanced economies will average 0.5 per cent growth, emerging and developing countries expect to see their economies expand at 6.9-per-cent clip this year and a 6.1-per-cent rate in 2009, down from 8 per cent last year.
"In 2009, almost all global growth will come from the emerging economies," Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the fund's managing director, told a conference in Washington this week. While they are not immune to the impact of the financial market turbulence, "emerging economies are generally in a much better position than in the past," he said.
Preparing For The Shock Wave
Economists warn that the real economies of the BRIC countries have yet to feel the full force of the financial market turmoil.
"A massive shock is about to hit them," Alex Patelis, international economist for Merrill Lynch & Co. Inc., said in a report on emerging markets this week. He added that the governments - flush with foreign reserves - have many tools at their disposal to mitigate the impacts.
In the past month, borrowing costs have risen sharply in Brazil and the currency has dropped precipitously against the U.S. dollar - the real closed Friday at $0.473 (U.S.), down from $0.633 early this summer. In response to the turmoil, the Brazilian government has pumped liquidity into the banking sector, which remains sound. The central bank has reduced its stringent reserve requirement - which forces banks to hold a minimum percentage of deposits - three times in the past month to inject some $45-billion into the banking systems. The government has also increased support for state-owned development banks to finance much-needed infrastructure projects and private sector capital investment.
Brazil watchers are cautiously optimistic that the country will weather the current crisis without experiencing the severe economic contractions it has faced in the past. Economic growth - which topped 6 per cent at an annualized rate in the second quarter - is generally forecast to drop to between 3 and 3.5 per cent next year.
Still, consumers and business leaders are stunned and increasingly wary.
Brazilians have been whipsawed between assurances just a few weeks ago by President da Silva that they would be largely unscathed by the U.S.-centred crisis, and the frightening financial market developments of the past two weeks.
"At this point in time, psychologists are in a better position to talk about the consequences of the financial crisis than economists or people from the financial world," said Celso Funcia Lemme, a professor of finance at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro's graduate school of business.
The troubling signs here are abundant, particularly if you believe the stock market serves as an early warning signal for the financial health of the companies listed there. Many Brazilians argue that their market is oversold, blaming foreign investors who pulled out either in panic or to cover losses in other markets.
Petrobras - Brazil's largest company, which is sitting on some of the most exciting oil discoveries in a generation - has seen its stock price wither as world oil prices slumped from a record $147 a barrel this spring to below $70 this week. After trading as high as $14.50 on the New York Stock Exchange this spring, Petrobras shares fell to as low as $6.50, before bouncing back in the past week after announcing further discoveries in the deep waters off shore.
At current levels, the stock market is assigning virtually no value to the company's new reserves additions, which lie hundreds of kilometres offshore, under thousands of metres of water and subsea salt layers, Almir Guilherme Barbassa, the company chief financial officer, said in an interview at the company's headquarters.
But he insisted that the company's $35-billion annual capital budget - and its offshore development plans - would not be unduly affected by the short-term turbulence in financial markets.
THE BEST WAS STILL TO COME
The crisis hasn't seemed to dim the enthusiasm in the port city of Rio.
The home of the country's oil industry is humming with activity, and industry executives shrug off the recent slump in crude prices, confident that when global growth returns, the price will climb again.
Domestic and foreign oil companies are bulking up to join the offshore bonanza; local manufacturers are supplying major resource and infrastructure projects, and newly-minted consumers clog the streets with recently-bought vehicles that can run on ethanol or gasoline.
While the South American giant has not shown the kind of spectacular growth enjoyed by China or India or even Russia, foreign investors like its combination of economic potential, monetary discipline, sound corporate governance and a market-friendly government, at least relative to other BRIC countries.
The Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan recently conducted a thorough review of emerging countries to determine where it wanted to place its biggest bet on long-term, "relationship" investments. It concluded Brazil offered the right mix of economic and financial success, coupled with low political risk.
Teachers has invested in Brazilian real estate and allocated several hundred million dollars to energy, mineral and infrastructure companies controlled by Brazilian entrepreneur Eike Batista. And while many foreign investors have pulled their money out of emerging markets like Brazil, Teachers is looking long term and remains confident in the country's future.
"We don't cut and run at the first sign of trouble," Bill Royan, director of relationship investing with Teachers, said in an interview. "We are in it for the long-term."
NEW PLAYERS EMERGE
Oil company OGX Corp. did not exist three years ago. But the company's story reflects Brazil's own story over the past several years - from unbridled optimism of a commodity boom, to a stunning turnaround in its financial markets, to a guarded optimism about its future prospects.
Led by Rodolfo Landim Machado - a former top executive at Petrobras - OGX has won the right to explore in relatively shallow water in Brazil's prolific offshore oil fields, and has a $4.5-billion war chest to explore and develop its concessions.
Last spring, OGX launched Brazil's largest initial public offering on record, a $4-billion stock sale that caught not only the peak on crude prices but the tail end of a remarkable IPO boom that had juiced Sao Paulo's Bovespa stock market throughout 2007.
Since then, OGX shares have tumbled - reflecting first the slide in oil prices and then the rout in equities worldwide.
In an interview at his 12th-floor offices, Mr. Landim appeared unruffled. With enough cash in the bank to fund the company's development plans for several years, OGX is now focused on finding that oil bonanza that he and his exploration team - also former Petrobras executives - believe await them.
"This is going to take some time, but over the long-term, these resources are going to change Brazil," Mr. Landim said of the country's offshore discoveries. "The reserves are there - this is the most important thing - but it will take time to transform these resources into wealth."
Other Brazilian companies share that optimism about the future, said Joao Teixeira, Sao Paulo-based executive vice-president with the Spanish bank Grupo Santander.
The sugar cane-based ethanol industry, for example, has announced plans to invest some $33-billion in the next four years to expand capacity in a sector that Mr. da Silva has touted as a model for the world. Despite the financial crisis and the depressed prices for ethanol in Brazil, companies say they are proceeding with their development plans.
IT WASN'T ALWAYS THIS WAY
The cautious optimism in Brazil is a far cry from the country's experience in previous financial crises, when its debt-burdened, inflation-racked economy was not just sideswiped by global turmoil but suffered a crash similar to a head-on collision with a Mack truck.
After enjoying debt-fuelled growth rates of nearly 7 per cent in the 1970s, the country hit the wall when successive oil shocks drove up inflation and interest rates. The country accepted an IMF-imposed austerity program in 1980, but then grew at a meagre rate of 1.4 per cent through the decade, and actually contracted by a stunning 4 per cent in 1990, the last year of the military dictatorship. Household incomes plunged as hyperinflation took hold, peaking at 2,938 per cent in 1990.
A new series of austerity programs - ushered in by the first democratically elected government in decades - stabilized the economy but could not rein in Brazil's debt problems. As a result, the country was highly vulnerable to the shocks of the Asian crisis in 1997 and the meltdown of the Russian ruble the following year. Foreign capital fled, interest rates soared and the economic growth ground to a halt in 1998 and 1999.
Since 2003, the country has enjoyed solid progress, with annual growth of 4.6 per cent. While modest compared to its BRIC counterparts, Brazil's economic performance has allowed the government to amass $206-billion in reserves and paid off its debts to the IMF and the Paris Club of creditor nations ahead of schedule two years ago.
The government managed to boost income for average Brazilians by raising social benefits to the country's poorest families and providing wage increases to public servants. That, in turn, has contributed to a surge in domestic consumption.
Once notorious for its gaping income inequality, the middle class has expanded steadily in recent years. Some 52 per cent of Brazilian families are now middle class - meaning they have formal jobs, and can get credit and buy cars - up from 44 per cent in 2001, according to the non-profit Getulio Vargas Foundation.
At the same time, the income of the poorest 10 per cent of Brazilians has climbed by 49 per cent, compared to a 7-per-cent gain for the wealthiest 10 per cent, the foundation reported.
However, some economists complain that the government's emphasis on social spending has left it vulnerable to a downturn in revenues, which could drive the country's budget deficit sharply higher.
Despite those concerns, there is broad agreement that the country was far better prepared to face the financial shock of 2008 than it had ever been in the past.
"The feeling at the moment is a feeling of concern - people are watching closely what is happening but from a position of strength," Mr. Teixeira, the veteran Sao Paulo banker, said. "This is the first time that Brazil has faced an international crisis from such a position."
That relative strength is shared by other BRIC countries, even as their financial markets swoon and individual companies face real pain. And when the crisis finally subsides, the BRIC countries may find they play an even greater role in the world economy.

RUSSIA
OLIGARCHS ON THE ROPES
The impact
When oligarchs become beggars, you know Russia is in trouble. The financial crisis, combined with the plunge in commodity prices, has not been kind to the three dozen or so oligarchs who control huge swaths of the economy, from banks and steel companies to oil producers and car plants. They picked up the assets on the cheap during the 1990s privatization campaign of then president Boris Yeltsin. For evidence, look no further than Vnesheconombank (VEB). The oligarchs are lined up at the door of the state-owned bank to borrow money to refinance the foreign debts of their businesses. The flight from emerging markets suddenly made these loans risky.
The reaction
Russia has channelled $50-billion (U.S.) into VEB, which says it has already received applications for loans exceeding that amount. VEB is a tough player. Its board chairman is Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and loans will be made at no less than five percentage points over the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. The three-month U.S. dollar Libor rate is about 4.5 per cent, meaning VEB loans will be priced at a hefty 9.5 per cent or so. VEB began life in 1922 as the first state trading bank after the Communist revolution eliminated the private commercial banks. Initially, it financed imports and exports. In 2001, it became responsible for the foreign debts of the defunct Soviet Union. It is now a domestic development bank.
The outlook
Among the companies asking for loans are Lukoil and Rosneft, Russia's biggest oil companies; X5 Retail Group, the largest grocer; VTB, the second-largest bank; and no less than Rusal, the world's top aluminum producer, which is controlled by the allegedly richest oligarch, Oleg Deripaska. As the financial crisis swamps Russia, he has been selling assets, including his stake in Canada's Magna International. Now Mr. Deripaska is looking for government assistance. What a difference a month makes.

CHINA
EXPORTS ARE EVERYTHING
The impact
China has sailed through the credit crisis so far, avoiding the capital flight that has hurt Russia and Brazil. Its banks, which rely much more heavily on deposits (instead of capital markets) than Western ones, remain relatively strong. The very high rate of saving by Chinese households, combined with the restrictions on easy American-style mortgage terms, make the financial system more solid. However, in the so-called real economy, an export-reliant country such as China cannot remain immune for long from faltering growth and spending in North America and its other big markets. Adjusted for inflation and currency fluctuations, exports actually fell in August from the same month last year - an unusual turn of events for a country used to ever-soaring demand for its goods. Its imports are slowing too, suggesting that its hunger for raw materials, which helped fuel a global commodities boom, may be waning. Real estates sales in the big cities have dropped by about half and prices are softening too.
The reaction
The government in Beijing has cut the main lending rate and reduced the amount of cash that banks must keep on hand. It has the leeway to do more. With healthy government finances and inflation falling back to earth after reaching more than 8 per cent earlier this year, it could easily spend money or cut interest rates to kick-start the economy.
The outlook
Economic growth was already slowing when the crisis hit, falling to an annualized 10.1 per cent in the second quarter from 12.6 per cent a year earlier. Most economists expect it to fall further, to about 8 or 9 per cent, by early next year.

INDIA
THE NEW ECONOMY FALTERS
The impact
Indian stocks have plunged, shedding about half their value from the peak of last January. Foreign funds have sold more than $11-billion (U.S.) in Indian stocks, after purchasing a record $17.4-billion in 2007. The Indian rupee is down sharply too, making it costly for the country to import oil despite the recent fall in the global price. Airlines, with their high fuel costs, have suffered as a result. Jet Airways, the largest domestic carrier, said this week that it will cut 1,900 workers and Air India is considering giving leave without pay to 15,000. Outsourcing companies, the backbone of India's New Economy, are reporting lower profits as overseas multinationals reduce orders. The first major bank to feel the effects of the global crisis is ICICI Bank, India's second-biggest lender. It has seen its shares fall quickly because of its exposure to tainted assets in the United States and Britain.
The reaction
India's government has followed the lead of other countries around the world and injected more money into the financial system. In the latest move, New Delhi asked the central bank to make about $5.1-billion available to financial firms. It has also raised a ceiling on foreign investment in Indian corporate bonds, cut the amount of cash that banks must maintain in their coffers, made it easier for Indian companies to borrow overseas, and eased restrictions on derivative instruments that give foreign investors a way to invest in Indian stock markets.
The outlook
Finance Minister P. Chidambaram insisted this week that India's economic fundamentals are healthy. "We must vanish fear," he said. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has said he expects economic growth of 7.5 to 8 per cent in this financial year, a drop from 9 per cent last year but still one of the highest rates in the world. India has $280-billion in foreign exchange reserves. But inflation is around 12 per cent, making it hard for the government to reduce interest rates to stimulate the economy.

Full text: There's an old saying that goes: when the water-hole dries up, that's when all the animals start to look at each other funny.
The last two weeks have seen a spectacular crash of global equity markets and a virtual paralysis in capital flow. The headlines are frightening, but digging behind them even slightly is enough to make your blood run cold.
This is especially true if you are close to retirement and have just watched your investments go for a swan dive off the tallest peak of Bay Street, ripping one-third or more of their value on the way down. But the scariest part of a good old-fashioned economic meltdown is waiting for the other shoe to drop. That's when the terror sets in - not having a clue what comes next.
As last week's stock market collapse showed, psychology can drive events to a crisis point as much as real economic happenings such as job losses, trade slowdowns, property foreclosures and bank failures. So how do home buyers and sellers keep their heads on straight in these troubled times?
For all the doomsday scenarios that have been put forward in excruciating detail on the business pages and the television news, Canada (and Toronto) don't really have to worry about property foreclosures and bank failures seen in the United States.
Both of these problems were brought on by the subprime mortgage feeding frenzy, which put property in the hands of people who could not afford to service their mortgages or even come up with a down payment. To no one's surprise, as more homes were bought through these weak mortgages, prices rose dramatically in a speculative spiral.
When it became clear that many subprime mortgages were worthless, the bad debt incurred was repackaged into complicated financial instruments and sold to institutional investors thinking they were investing in mortgage-backed securities. But U.S. home prices are now diving, so not only are the mortgages unlikely to be serviced, they also are worth more money than the actual properties.
And that, in a nutshell, is how a full-on banking panic has paralyzed the North American economy.
Probably the most important data indicator in which local real estate watchers can find solace is the arrears rate. The percentage of residential mortgages that are behind current payments by 90 days or more stands at 0.27 per cent, according to data compiled by the chartered banks and reported by the Canadian Association of Accredited Mortgage Professionals. This accounts for about 20,000 to 25,000 of residential mortgages in Canada.
To put this in perspective, at the peak of the last major recession in 1992 the arrears rate stood at 0.6 per cent. For even more perspective, consider the United States. The current arrears rate is 4 per cent for prime mortgages (meaning people who qualified for a decent interest rate and went through the rigmarole of actually depositing a substantial down payment). Subprime mortgages - those handed out with no down payment on a wing and a prayer - are in arrears at a rate of 18 per cent.
"The consensus view is that housing markets have turned and that we can expect a slower pace of price appreciation across Ontario," said Ted Tsiakopoulos, Canada Mortgage Housing Corp.'s regional economist for Ontario.
But Mr. Tsiakopoulos is quick to add that he is not predicting a devaluation of home prices caused by a flood of listings. Certainly there are markets in Toronto where that is a concern because of job losses, such as in Windsor and Oshawa.
For those who are predicting a market correction in Toronto similar to that of 1992 - one caused by a typical bubble of price spirals caused by unhinged speculation - there are a lot of reasons to breathe easy.
"It's important to remember that 2007 was a record year [in terms of price increases and sales volume]," he said.
"What we're seeing is employment growth slowing and the pent-up demand for housing finally being absorbed. A natural market response in 2008 and 2009 is a balanced market where you see prices growing at or near the rate of inflation."
Mr. Tsiakopoulos is predicting sales volumes for Greater Toronto to settle in the 2003 range, when they stood at 79,000, compared with 93,193 for 2007.
Resale home prices have held steady in Greater Toronto through to August (the last month for which data is available). The average price stood at $376,236 in 2007, and has gone up 2.2 per cent to $384,605 for the January-to-August period in 2008, according to the Toronto Real Estate Board. For new detached houses, the average price for January-to-August stood at $536,404 throughout Greater Toronto, up 4.9 per cent from the same period in 2007 from $511,322, according to CMHC.
Another advantage is historically low interest rates, that are likely to remain low with the help of the Bank of Canada to avoid a recession.
The big mystery is how the terms of lending will tighten up thanks to the chaos causing all these sleepless nights these days.
"The run-up in price appreciation has been steady and sustainable here, not at all like what the United States experienced," Mr. Tsiakopoulos said. "That, and historically low interest rates, should make the adjustment easier."

Full text: The U.S. financial crisis has put the squeeze on another Canadian condominium development whose financing has run out following the collapse of investment bank Lehman Brothers Inc. This time a five-tower development in Surrey, B.C., is searching for new funds one month after its major financier, Lehman, filed for bankruptcy protection.
Construction is halted at the project, The Infinity at Central City, which applied for protection from its creditors this week.
The development gained widespread attention in 2005 when the relatively low-priced units in its first tower, now completed and occupied, sold out in seven hours.
Now, it's a much different market for South Korean businessman Hee Yong Yang, who took over as developer last year. He's trying to woo new partners to complete the two buildings currently under construction.
"Unfortunately, along with many other reputable developers, Mr. Yang has been adversely impacted by ... worldwide tightening in the credit and financial markets," said lawyer Robert Millar of Fasken Martineau DuMoulin LLP, who is helping lead the refinancing effort.
The most likely scenarios are that a developer will fill Lehman's shoes with some kind of premiums paid or discount offered, or the project will be subject to a full-out sale process, Mr. Millar said.
Earlier in the month, developer Bazis International Inc., which also counted Lehman as a partner, said it had managed to secure a new financing arrangement for its $450-million luxury condo project in downtown Toronto.
While Kazakhstan-based Bazis found its new partners in Europe, the Surrey project has apparently garnered some interest from unnamed local developers.
Unlike some other projects that have run into trouble in Vancouver, Infinity is on time, on budget, and has a large number of reported pre-sales, which could help it find new funding, Mr. Millar said.
If Infinity isn't as fortunate, buyers' deposits are protected and will be returned to them, Mr. Millar said.
While Mr. Millar hasn't heard of any other development projects in Vancouver hitting the financing wall at this time, it wouldn't be surprising, he said.
Things will be even tougher for coming developments, whose funding options were becoming scarce well before Lehman's collapse, he said.
Mr. Millar added that a number of his clients have pulled projects in recent months.

Full text: Desperate owners raffling off their homes
'AT the time, it didn't seem dumb," said Karen Crawford, in the breezy tone of someone who has been mercifully absolved of the consequences of a very bad decision. "I wonder how many people in America did the same thing." Two years ago, Ms. Crawford and her husband, Dennis Kelly, moved from their log house in Hancock, Md., to a renovated 1929 farmhouse nearby, which they bought for $375,000 (U.S.). They put their old house, which they owned outright, on the market, planning to pay for the new one with proceeds from the sale. But the real estate market cooled, and the house sat unsold. Two months after the move, saddled with a costly mortgage, the couple reluctantly put their new farmhouse up for sale; after more than a year, it didn't find a buyer, either. "Soon it was going to go into foreclosure," said Ms. Crawford, a 60-year-old elementary school teacher, a hint of the panic of that time creeping into her voice.
Desperate, Ms. Crawford came up with a novel strategy: she would hold a raffle. Tickets would go for $100 each, and one lucky person would win the farmhouse. If they could sell enough tickets, they could walk away debt-free.
Last December, the couple teamed with a real estate agent and a local charity and set about publicizing the raffle, posting flyers and calling news outlets. By the time the drawing was held at a local country club this past March, they had sold almost 6,500 tickets, raising enough money to cover the cost of the house along with a surplus of more than $200,000 that went to the charity. Having already moved back to the log house, they counted themselves lucky to still have a place to live.
"We were so happy because we'd gone on this horrific two-year journey," Ms. Crawford said.
The raffle idea had come to her in a burst of inspiration, she said. But she is not the only American homeowner to have turned to some version of this unorthodox approach in recent months. As the U.S. economy has worsened and the real estate market has continued to slump, a number of Americans have been using raffles and competitions in a last-ditch effort to raise money and unload a house. And as mortgages have become harder to obtain, some would-be homeowners are being tempted by the chance - a small one, but with better odds than most lotteries - to own a house without dealing with a bank (though the victors must pay taxes on their winnings).
Raffles seem to have become particularly popular in Maryland, where new ones have recently have been announced for homes ranging from a $550,000 four-bedroom house in Dunkirk to a six-bedroom log cabin in Edgewater valued at more than $1-million.
"Instead of selling it to one person, we're going to try to sell it 31,500 people," said Tom Walters, who owns the Edgewater property, referring to the number of $50 tickets he must sell to cover the house's appraised value, a $10,000 second prize and earnings for a charity. Mr. Walters, a mortgage broker, bought the house in 2006 and completed a 4,500-square-foot addition in June. But his career has suffered as a result of the mortgage crisis, he said, and it has lately become "impossible" to borrow on the house. "It's been a perfect storm of bad real estate mojo," he said.
A raffle, he hopes, will get more attention than a traditional sale because of its novelty. "We thought, let's be more pro-active, rather than just putting it on the market," he said. If it succeeds, he will avoid paying a sales commission to a real estate agent.
Home raffles are hardly an easy proposition. Gambling regulations in many states make holding a private raffle for a house or land illegal unless the homeowner has a non-profit organization as a partner, and the homeowner cannot make more than the appraised value of the house. Ms. Crawford worked with the San Mar Children's Home, a charity based in Boonsboro, Md., that operates group homes for adolescent girls. San Mar entered into a contingency contract for the farmhouse, under which it would pay for the house with raffle earnings only if those earnings reached a certain level, and then oversaw the drawing.
Bruce Anderson, the chief executive of San Mar, said he had to get approval from the state of Maryland to hold the raffle, and that he was required to notify officials of the minimum and maximum number of tickets he planned to sell (5,000 and 7,000, respectively), as well as the date of the drawing.
The raffle was a success: San Mar made a $214,000 profit beyond the price of the farmhouse and associated other costs, like advertising. But if the minimum number of tickets hadn't been sold by the final drawing date, the organization would have been obligated to refund everyone's money, and the couple would have been back where they started.
Some homeowners who have considered raffles find the red tape daunting. Last summer, Bernadette Grieves, a passenger agent for an airline who lives in Peabody, Mass., looked into holding a raffle for her five-bedroom colonial, which she's been trying to sell for nearly three years. Ultimately, she decided to continue with conventional methods. "It does sound great," she said of the raffle idea, "especially because the market is horrible. But there's a lot of work to it." Others, though, are finding creative ways around the rules. Julie Sigwart, a Web designer, is holding what she calls a "skills contest" to give away her six-bedroom, four-bathroom house with ocean views in Maui, which she has been trying to sell since last October.
As in the raffle for Ms. Crawford and Mr. Kelly's home, she will charge a $100 entry fee, but participants will have to write an essay - the theme is "Aloha, what does it mean to you?" - which will be judged by a group of "prominent members of the community," she said. (The judges have yet to be finalized.) Because the contest isn't a game of chance, state approval is not required, and teaming with a non-profit group isn't necessary.
Ms. Sigwart has wanted to downsize for more than a year, and has repeatedly marked her house down, from $729,000 to $600,000. But the market in her area is terrible; she recently attended an open house in a nearby neighbourhood and was the only person there. After a contract on her house fell through in August, her husband suggested the contest. Asked when she hopes to begin the contest and declare a winner, she replied, "As soon as possible on both counts." Scott Bernard, a marketing consultant and another frustrated seller, is also holding a skills-based contest, although the word "skills" in this case might be generous. Each contestant vying for his remodelled, one-storey ranch house in Sebastian, Fla., which he bought in 2005 for $217,000 and renovated for $30,000 in hopes of flipping it, must submit a $49 entrance fee and a copy of a black-and-white line drawing that he or she downloads from a Web site and colours by hand. Three judges will pick the top 20 entries based on "creativity," and those images will be posted online so the public can pick a winner.
The line drawing shows two dancers; it's meant as an homage to Support Dance, a non-profit in Lake Worth, Fla., that Mr. Bernard has decided to work with even though he is not legally required to. Teaming with a charity allows him to feel that the project is "not just about Scott Bernard getting rid of his house," he said, and he will set aside $2 from every entry for the organization.
Mr. Bernard's motives are not entirely altruistic. Hoping to turn the contest into a business, he and a partner created the Web site where the drawing is posted, www.howtowinmyhouse.com, in July, with the idea that it could become a clearinghouse for real estate giveaway contests. Since Mr. Bernard's contest was announced by a local newspaper that month, he said, "I've been working the local market, doing radio and newspaper interviews." Spreading the word is crucial to the success of such contests, according to those who have held them, as is promoting them beyond the local area. (Almost everyone who raffles a home sets up a Web site that accepts on-line orders.) But desperate homeowners should not count on being able to match the publicity given to Ms. Crawford and Mr. Kelly's raffle: After a local newspaper wrote an article about it, it was mentioned on CNN on Super Bowl Sunday.
"We sold 1,500 tickets that day," said Mr. Anderson of the San Mar Children's Home, who has since fielded so many requests for information that he will hold a how-to workshop in Baltimore in November. The success of that raffle seems to have inspired many sellers, particularly in Maryland. Still, he said, "if you study this you'll find that the majority of time it's not successful." Mr. Walters said he has sold around 2,000 tickets in the raffle for his Edgewater, Md., house, including several to Asian buyers after a South Korean newspaper picked up the story. His goal is to sell 31,500 tickets.
Mr. Bernard's colouring contest has drawn just 34 paid entries so far, two months into a submissions period that ends on Dec. 17 or whenever he receives the planned maximum number of entries, 5,900. Even for the contest winners, there can be serious complications, as Dennis Weaver, a county clerk who took a $100 chance and won Ms. Crawford and Mr. Kelly's farmhouse, discovered. Mr. Weaver had to take out a mortgage to pay the $135,000 in taxes on the prize, and has since decided to sell the farmhouse, returning it to the languishing real estate market. He held an auction, but there were no bids. Then he listed it with the real estate agent who helped orchestrate the raffle, asking, he said, in the high $200,000 range. One deal fell through, and now he is in contract with another buyer.
If the farmhouse doesn't sell this time, maybe its new owner can hold a raffle.

Full text: A group of retailers along Bloor Street led by china shop William Ashley has launched what one city official called a "mudslinging" campaign in their fight against a $25-million plan to remake the posh downtown shopping strip with wider, granite sidewalks.
The group, called Concerned About Bloor, alleged in an e-mailed press release that the local business improvement area groups paying $20-million toward the Bloor project are plagued by "serious irregularities," including the granting of tens of thousands of dollars in contracts to two volunteer board members, lobbyist Doug Jure and real-estate broker Bob Saunderson.
Clayton Ruby, the high-profile lawyer hired by William Ashley to fight the Bloor Street project in court, argues the contracts, which totalled more than $100,000, broke the BIA's own rules: "What these guys did is ignored the language of the constitution that governs the BIA."
Mr. Jure, chairman of the Bloor-Yorkville Business Improvement Area, called the accusation "outrageous." He said that his $3,000-a-month contract to act as "government affairs consultant" for the BIA to seek funding for the project, among other things, does not break any rules and that he recused himself when the board made the decision.
He has had the contract since 2002, but was paid $2,000 a month until last year.
On the BIA's board, Mr. Jure also represents, but does not work for, the Devon Group, a Yorkville-area PR firm also hired by the BIA last year, in a decision from which he also recused himself, but that was also highlighted by Concerned About Bloor.
"You can appreciate how awkward it is that we have a major retailer behaving in this manner," Mr. Jure said, referring to William Ashley's campaign against the project, which he said now has nowhere near the 50 dissenting retailers the group originally claimed.
Mr. Saunderson said he was paid $3,000-a-month for an 11-month period from 2005 to 2006 to work two days a week selling the project to local businesses.
But he also recused himself from the vote on his contract.
He said he would be seeking legal advice: "It's actually, I think, libellous ... I wouldn't rule [a libel suit] out. This is disgusting."
Mike Major, the city official in charge of overseeing the city's business improvement areas, said no city rules were broken: "It's all mudslinging at this point."
Concerned About Bloor, which has hired the communications and lobbying firm Navigator Ltd., sent the press release to The Globe and Mail on Wednesday, saying that members of the BIAs would raise the issues at a joint annual meeting of the two organizations that night at the Royal Ontario Museum.
But according to Briar de Lange, the general manager of the Bloor-Yorkville BIA, and Mr. Jure, William Ashley representatives did not raise any concerns.
Mr. Jure did make a presentation about his contract at the meeting, however.
Last week, Mr. Ruby argued in Divisional Court that the city failed to conduct a proper environmental assessment for the project. He urged a panel of three judges to stop the project - already under construction - to allow for an economic impact study and more public consultations.
The court reserved its decision.

Full text: These 'horseless carriages' cost a little extra and may take a few seconds longer to produce hot water but they'll help you save money in the long run
Tall and stately, it goes about its business, day in, day out. Despite being essential, it goes unnoticed, too, unless it breaks. A warm well of watery goodness, it's the grandfather clock of your home's infrastructure.
Ding-dong, time's up.
A few weeks ago, I watched as my old hot water tank was plucked from its post, unsympathetically strapped to a gurney and wheeled to the retirement home. Goodbye gramps, don't let the patio door hit your portly, inefficient old butt on the way out. Hello sexy new Rinnai tankless, meet my laundry room wall.
My wife was the one who protested, but not out of nostalgia: "What about my obscenely long showers that come close to approximating the temperature of the sun?" she asked. (I may be embellishing her words a little.) "And what if we want to do two things at once? And what about noise?"
She had every right to be concerned. A few years ago we lived, briefly, in a condo equipped with a rinky-dink tankless unit that couldn't cope. I, however, have been a "let's put in a quarter and see what happens" kind of guy since 1980, when I was a fixture at the local arcade - in other words, new technology doesn't scare me.
Besides, with a red-hot endorsement by Mike Holmes in these very pages on Nov. 9, 2007, and with so many of the architects I've met going tankless, how could we lose? We certainly wouldn't lose any money, since the unit and the installation wouldn't cost a red cent.
Newten Home Comfort (www.newten.ca) offers these newfangled contraptions as rentals, just like the old tanks. And unless installers encounter awkward corners requiring extra-long pieces of pipe, installation is free, as is the draining, disconnection and transportation of ol' granddad to Enbridge (or wherever).
Yes, these horseless carriages cost a little extra - $35 a month, compared with $10 - but we'll save on our natural gas bill and we've gained about five square feet of storage space (which my wife has already filled).
Still, I'd be a bad husband had I not grilled installer Frank Mongillo of Waza Water Systems beforehand to make sure my little lobster will be happy. So, once he and I discussed where the unit would be placed (dictated mostly by the thick tubular vent that must exit through an exterior wall), I asked the hard questions:
Architourist : On the other side of the wall this is being mounted on is our bathroom. While I know this location is good because the heated water won't have very far to travel, what about noise or vibration?
Mr. Mongillo : "If it's mounted properly, it's not going to vibrate; it's not like a washing machine. There is a fan that runs, so you'll hear a hum when it's on, but when it's not working, there's nothing. And they're extremely quiet - much quieter than your furnace fan or your dryer."
Architourist : Will we run out of hot water?
Mr. Mongillo : "Size really makes a big difference with these systems. On a Rinnai unit, you'll get 4.2 gallons per minute."
This amount, he explains, can feed two big things (two showers or a shower and a washing machine) and one small thing (such as a faucet). Running out of hot water is impossible, since as long as the unit is running, it's making it. Smaller units, like the one in our former condo, just don't produce enough to supply more than one application at a time, which makes it seem as if you've run out when, in reality, you haven't.
While the R75 model (which is going into our home) works for "90 per cent" of residential applications, he says, "these units can be ganged together" in rare cases where a super-high supply is necessary.
Architourist : And the supernova heat - will my wife be able to remove a layer of skin?
Mr. Mongillo : "The person who likes the hottest showers sets the temperature on the water heater," he says. An old-fashioned tank, he adds, is usually set much hotter than even the hottest shower, so everyone in the house is mixing with cold water. By setting the unit to that of the hottest shower-taker's preference, we'll save money and I'll be the only one mixing for my tepid showers.
All told, installation went swimmingly and took 3½ hours. The only "incident" occurred when a number of bricks (and the mortar) shook themselves loose during the drilling of the exterior wall.
A Newten representative assured me, however, that should Mr. Mongillo's on-the-spot repair job fail in the coming months, they'd be happy to pick up the tab for a brick mason's visit.
Three weeks later, we're convinced shipping grandpa to the home was best. Yes, it takes a few seconds longer for a freshly opened faucet to produce hot water and, when it's quiet and we're near the unit, we do hear a soft whirring, but it's no big deal.
The big deal is we're a little greener, we can clean this unit ourselves - "It's just like descaling a kettle," says Mr. Mongillo - and instead of turning on the hot for a few seconds to wash something down the drain, like I always have, I now use cold, since despite offering unlimited hot water, a tankless system has me thinking about my consumption.
And, of course, lobster-wife has never been happier.

Abstract: When it comes to trucks, when it comes to the building of a banana room, we want the state of the art, because that's what makes the money and that's what helps us provide the best-quality product for our customers. I am not too concerned about the desk I am sitting at right now, but I am very concerned about the trucks going out and delivering to my customers," Mr. [Davis Yung] said.

Full text: From mom and pop to young entrepreneurs, small and medium-sized enterprises help drive Canada's economy
Vancouver produce importer Davis Yung more than doubled his warehouse space this year to handle growing volumes, and invested in the construction of new banana-ripening rooms.
Mr. Yung, co-founder and president of Fresh Direct Produce Ltd. , is also planning to add to his fleet of 14 refrigerated trucks. "But now, of course, we have to look at more fuel-efficient trucks than before."
Across the country, Charlottetown-based video game developer Other Ocean Interactive is expanding to St. John's, where it is opening a new studio - financed, in part, by profits from its role in co-developing the hugely successful Super Monkey Ball game and backed by $2.4-million in funding from the Newfoundland government.
Over a five-year period, the company plans to create 62 jobs, and has started recruiting video game artists, designers, producers and programmers, Other Ocean's studio head, Deirdre Ayre, said in an interview from her Charlottetown office, which has grown to a staff of 50 since it opened two years ago.
The company has had a lot of success recruiting talented, creative people in their early 30s, to the benefit of the local economy, Ms. Ayre said.
"They're coming to this part of the world and they're really laying down roots. They're buying homes and having babies."
In Barrie, Ont., Southmedic Inc. , which manufactures and distributes specialty medical equipment, expects to ride out the current economic downturn the same way it weathered other slowdowns in its 25-year history - by tuning out the bad news, to some extent, and focusing on factors it can control, Lee McDonald, president and chief executive officer, said in an interview.
"Honest to God, if you listen to CNN for any length of time or CTV or whatever, you want to go and hang yourself.
"But if you actually turn around and look at your own business and look at what you are doing, there is still an awful lot of opportunity," said Ms. McDonald, whose company now employs 100 people, including process engineers and research and development specialists recruited from Ontario's sinking auto industry.
In a faltering economy, Canada's small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have been a bastion of stability, accounting for 38 per cent of all new job growth in the past year, according to economists.
And while the sector is not immune to the spiralling effects of the global credit crisis, "they will be the first to emerge when the recovery begins," Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce economist Benjamin Tal said in an interview.
"For the first time in two decades, SME economic activity will outpace the rest of the economy during a period of economic slowdown ... and by next year, as the economy begins to recover, SMEs in aggregate appear to be well positioned to resume their traditional role as the pioneers of the economic cycle," Mr. Tal wrote in an Oct. 6 research report.
Small and mid-sized businesses account for roughly 45 per cent of Canada's gross domestic product and 60 per cent of private sector employment, said Ted Mallett, vice-president of research and chief economist of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business. (The CFIB defines small businesses as those with fewer than 50 employees and medium-sized businesses as those with fewer than 500 employees.)
Credit concerns have accelerated, Mr. Mallett said, "but employment markets appear to be reasonably stable for now. While large employers are jettisoning employees by the thousands, "cutting back on employment is typically a last resort measure among small-business owners."
These employees, of course, support the national economy through their consumer spending - as do the business owners themselves when they rent real estate, buy trucks, invest in new equipment or buy office furniture, Mr. Tal said.
As a result, Canada's retailers, information technology providers and telecommunications companies are turning their attention to the small-business market as a source of potential sales growth.
"There are only so many big banks and very large Canadian companies they can sell to, so we now see all kinds of big brands trying desperately to get at the SME market," said Mark Healy, a partner at Toronto-based Torque Customer Strategy, a marketing consulting firm.
At Fresh Direct in Vancouver, Mr. Yung scrimps on furniture - he picks up second-hand items at auctions.
"But when it comes to trucks, when it comes to the building of a banana room, we want the state of the art, because that's what makes the money and that's what helps us provide the best-quality product for our customers. I am not too concerned about the desk I am sitting at right now, but I am very concerned about the trucks going out and delivering to my customers," Mr. Yung said. He and business partners, Albert Lum and Kam Chiu Lee, started the company five years ago with two trucks, 11 employees and "pretty much an empty warehouse."
Fresh Direct now has 85 employees, 50,000 square feet of warehouse space and a growing clientele for the 45 million kilograms of fresh fruit and vegetables it imports and distributes every year, serving both conventional and Asian grocery markets in Canada.
Small and medium-sized businesses often serve niche markets, so they tend to be less affected by a general downturn than larger companies, said Beth Wilson, Canadian managing partner of KPMG Enterprise, which advises small and medium-sized businesses.
"Also, I think the nature of entrepreneurs is that they are more bullish, they're more optimistic, there's a lot of strong perseverance there," Ms. Wilson said. They are also more flexible and able to adapt more quickly to changing market conditions, she added.
Ms. McDonald, a critical care nurse who founded Southmedic in 1983, said her firm has grown consistently year after year, and now exports its products to more than 60 countries. There is always a need for medical equipment in good times and bad - "there is always going to be a need to look after patients."
The company's conservative growth strategy has also served it well, Ms. McDonald said.
"We have always had enough profitability to invest our own capital to move forward ... we are quietly developing new products, but we are not in a position now where we are hand-to-mouth. We're on fairly safe ground."
Mr. Healy said smaller companies "are much, much more prudently managed" than larger firms, often by necessity, because it has always been tough for firms with annual revenue of under $10-million to get lines of credit or loans from the major chartered banks.
In Charlottetown, Ms. Ayre is aware of the global economic crisis, but more focused on more immediate business considerations.
Other Ocean Interactive, founded by her brother Andrew, is on a roll. It develops licensed and original games for some of the industry's major distributors, and recently joined forces with Sega Corp. to adapt the Super Monkey Ball video game for the Apple iPhone.
The order book is full and Ms. Ayre, a Newfoundlander who returned to Atlantic Canada after graduating from Toronto's Ryerson University with a degree in radio and television, is hoping to lure other expatriates back home as well.
So, too, is Newfoundland Minister of Business Paul Oram.
The provincial government "is pleased to support the establishment of this new and exciting business opportunity, which will result in the creation of many well-paying, skilled jobs in the province," Mr. Oram said last month in announcing the game developer's expansion to St. John's.
"Other Ocean ... is a successful firm in a leading-edge, knowledge-based industry with significant potential for growth in North American and global markets - a welcome addition to our dynamic technology sector and just the kind of innovative, growth-oriented company that we want to attract to Newfoundland and Labrador."

FIRMS OPTIMISTIC DESPITE CREDIT CRUNCH
Credit concerns are "gathering speed," with 28 per cent of small and mid-sized companies reporting problems getting access to bank financing, up from 26 per cent a week ago and 18 per cent a month ago, the Canadian Federation of Independent Business reports.
Nonetheless, small-business owners are somewhat more optimistic about their long-term prospects as a result of co-ordinated actions by governments around the world to backstop the banking system - even though the credit taps haven't opened up yet.
"Although the balance of opinion remains cautious, pockets of strength remain," Ted Mallett, the CFIB's vice-president and chief economist, said in releasing results of a survey of 639 business owners.
The CFIB "business barometer" survey found that 34 per cent of business owners canvassed this week expect their companies to perform more strongly in the next 12 months, up from 28 per cent a week ago.
"Only 5 per cent expect to be much weaker in 12 months, but a large number of business owners, 29 per cent, expect to be somewhat weaker."
Mr. Mallett said employment markets "appear to be reasonably stable for now," with 25 per cent of business owners expecting to add full-time employees in the next 12 months.
The sector is more nimble and better positioned than big business to adapt to changing economic realities, Mr. Mallett said in an interview.
One of the inherent advantages of small firms is that they are able to change and react to market changes much faster than their larger competitors," Mr. Mallett said.
"Large firms are ... pretty hard-wired with respect to what their product lines are, what their marketing plans are. They have lots of people and machines dedicated to specific tasks. Larger firms tend to be more of a boom/bust scenario. They feel the business cycles much more severely than the small-business sector as a whole," Mr. Mallett said.
Fred Withers, a managing partner in Ernst & Young's Western Canada practice, said smaller firms "are the first movers around opportunity.
"They first people, typically, to add employees because they see the opportunity ... they are the people who get things started, and they tend to be more optimistic by nature," Mr. Withers said.
Small-business operators also have "a lot of emotional and financial investment in their companies" - a powerful incentive to push ahead, even in a faltering economy, said Beth Wilson, Canadian managing partner of KPMG Enterprise, which advises small- and medium-sized businesses.
And because most small and medium-sized enterprises are privately held, "they don't have the same governance processes ... they don't have the pressure of a public company reporting results quarterly," Ms. Wilson said.
"They do have the ability to think long-term and be more strategic, without that outside scrutiny on a short-term basis."

Full text: In the early hours of Oct. 22, 2003, military cadet Joe Grozelle disappeared from his residence room in Kingston. His body was found three weeks later in the Cataraqui River but an initial autopsy could not determine how Grozelle had died. A year later, a second autopsy and inquest proved no more conclusive and various police investigations have failed to discover how the body of a popular, well-rounded, 21-year-old, third-year student at the Royal Military College wound up dead in the river.
In detective fiction, some super sleuth would crack the case and discover the explanation for Grozelle's disappearance and death, whether it was a hazing incident that turned deadly or a flight from school pressures that ended in a freak accident or sorrowful suicide. But this is the real world and the fifth estate hasn't solved the mystery either. Instead, the program's new documentary Shadows of Doubt (CBC, 9 p.m.) raises a lot of questions about the unseemly alacrity of the initial military investigation, which it says was winding down even before Grozelle's body was discovered.
The fifth estate has unearthed unpublished military field notes, which concluded Grozelle had probably killed himself (although the Department of National Defence has publicly said its National Investigative Service had reached no conclusions when it turned the file over to police in 2004.) Suicide is a convenient conclusion for RMC and the military, but it contradicts the views of most who knew Grozelle, not merely his grieving parents, still looking for answers five years on, but also a good friend and classmate; his basketball coach, and Lieutenant-Colonel Rod McDonald, the college's registrar and the only military official who agreed to appear on camera. McDonald describes Grozelle, who came to RMC specifically to play basketball, as a "poster child" recruit, while his friends and coach feel he was coping well with a heavy academic load and the inevitable limitations his average height would place on his basketball career.
The program offers some tantalizing leads that have gone nowhere, including security-camera footage of four men crossing and then recrossing the bridge near where Grozelle's body was found that night, and complaints from students about a former cadet who had continuing access to the residence and was sexually propositioning students. It does not, on the other hand, bother chasing down some of the other stories that have emerged, including the accusation that Grozelle's computer was tampered with on the night of his disappearance or the various sightings of someone who looked like Grozelle in the first week following his disappearance.
In the end, the documentary's toughest conclusion is that the public should be questioning the competence and objectivity of the National Investigative Service, a kind of super-military police unit created in 1997 to deal with major crimes among defence personnel. Grozelle's father Ron clearly believes a more thorough initial investigation might have produced real answers, but the program presents a case puzzling enough to stump all inquiry.
In another neck of the TV woods entirely, on the supposedly lighter side of Canadian programming, it's hard to believe that Billable Hours (Showcase, 9 p.m.) is back for a third season. How can this underdeveloped and nasty little sitcom with plots more weird than funny manage to sustain another clutch of episodes?
The premise is that the impossibly snobby Clark Claxton III (Brandon Firla), the self-absorbed screwball Robin Howland (Jennifer Baxter) and the put-upon nice-guy Sam Caponelli (Fabrizio Filippo) all work for some high-flying Toronto law firm. Except that, contrary to everything you have ever heard about high-flying Toronto law firms, they don't work. They quip, they gossip, they wage feuds, they place bets, they abuse underlings, they get coffee, they order out, but never, ever do they practise any law.
In tonight's premiere, Clark and Robin bet Sam that he can't seduce the first woman to come off the elevator. The doors open and produce the firm's toughest old broad and the rest of the episode is devoted to a running gag, about a cardigan-clad, euchre-playing Sam pretending to be an old geezer, that is not only ageist, sexist and unfunny but also makes no sense. More amusing is the secondary plot in which Clark repeatedly sells colleagues his masochistically loyal personal assistant in exchange for things he really wants - like, for example, a muffin.
Next week, Clark opens the door on Robin while she is changing and the breast jokes get rolling. The only funny bit is a spoof of the Tolkien knowledge possessed by the nerds in IT. It's one tiny flash of satire based on things that might actually happen in some real office somewhere. Blink and you'll miss it.

John Doyle returns on Oct. 21.

Also airing tonight
If Republican John McCain were going to come back from the dead, he would have to do it tonight on the third Presidential Debate (U.S. networks, CBC Newsworld, CTV Newsnet, 9 p.m.) He and Democrat Barack Obama are supposed to be discussing domestic and economic policy and the moderator (Bob Schieffer of CBS's Face the Nation ) has promised to demand specifics. However, most U.S. media commentators yesterday seemed more interested in knowing whether McCain would ask Obama about his relationship with Bill Ayers, member of the sixties revolutionary organization the Weather Underground.
Y'all caught up with the matrimonial plans of Rayyan? Well, maybe not. The devout but liberated young doctor on Little Mosque on the Prairie (CBC, 8 p.m.) had resolved last season's cliffhanger by submitting to paternal pressure and becoming engaged to J.J. at the start of the season. Tonight, however, things get a little complicated when the disappointed Amaar, the community's hip young imam and Rayyan's obvious soulmate, returns from a trip to Toronto that turned into a pilgrimage to Mecca. Meanwhile, Rayyan's parents organize a huge engagement party.
The deeply annoying documentary Masonic Legends (Vision, 10 p.m.) wants to have its conspiracy-theory cake and eat it too. After much dramatic huffing and puffing about ancient history, secret rituals, re-enacted murders, powerful membership and international networks, it turns out that Halifax producer John Wesley Chisholm wants to explain that Freemasonry is actually a private society whose members merely seek self-knowledge and enlightenment. The film, Part 1 of a three-part series, features what it claims is unprecedented footage of Masonic rituals shot inside the order's lodges, and then soups it up with lots of spooky music. Mainly, this makes not merely the filmmaker but also the masons with their fake beards and baldly iterated biblical scripts look very silly. With friends like these.... K.T.

Abstract: The crisis was caused by the largest leveraged asset bubble and credit bubble in history. Leveraging and bubbles were not limited to the U.S. housing market, but also characterized housing markets in other countries. Moreover, excessive borrowing by financial institutions and some segments of the corporate and public sectors occurred in many economies.

Full text: It's time for radical and co-ordinated action
The rich world's financial system is headed toward meltdown. Stock markets have been falling most days, money markets and credit markets have shut down as their interest-rate spreads skyrocket, and it is still too early to tell whether the raft of measures adopted by the U.S. and Europe will stem the bleeding on a sustained basis.
A generalized run on the banking system has been a source of fear for the first time in seven decades, while the shadow banking system - broker-dealers, non-bank mortgage lenders, structured investment vehicles and conduits, hedge funds, money market funds, and private equity firms - are at risk of a run on their short-term liabilities.
On the real economic side, all the advanced economies - representing 55 per cent of global GDP - entered a recession even before the massive financial shocks that started in late summer. So we now have recession, a severe financial crisis and a severe banking crisis in the advanced economies.
Emerging markets were initially tied to this distress only when foreign investors began pulling out their money. Then panic spread to credit markets, money markets and currency markets, highlighting the vulnerabilities of many developing countries' financial systems and corporate sectors, which had experienced credit booms and had borrowed short and in foreign currencies. Countries with large current-account deficits and/or large fiscal deficits and with large short-term foreign currency liabilities have been the most fragile. But even the better-performing ones - such as Brazil, Russia, India and China - are at risk of a hard landing. Many emerging markets are at risk of a severe financial crisis.
The crisis was caused by the largest leveraged asset bubble and credit bubble in history. Leveraging and bubbles were not limited to the U.S. housing market, but also characterized housing markets in other countries. Moreover, excessive borrowing by financial institutions and some segments of the corporate and public sectors occurred in many economies. As a result, a housing bubble, a mortgage bubble, an equity bubble, a bond bubble, a credit bubble, a commodity bubble, a private equity bubble and a hedge funds bubble are bursting simultaneously.
The delusion that economic contraction in the U.S. and other advanced economies would be short and shallow - a V-shaped, six-month recession - has been replaced by certainty that this will be a long and protracted U-shaped recession, possibly lasting at least two years in the U.S. and close to two years in most of the rest of the world. And given the rising risk of a global systemic financial meltdown, the prospect of a decade-long L-shaped recession - such as the one experienced by Japan after the collapse of its real-estate and equity bubble - cannot be ruled out.
The growing disconnect between increasingly aggressive policy actions and strains in the financial market is scary. When Bear Stearns' creditors were bailed out to the tune of $30-billion in March, the rally in equity, money and credit markets lasted eight weeks. When the U.S. Treasury announced a bailout of mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in July, the rally lasted four weeks. When the $200-billion rescue of these firms was undertaken and their $6-trillion in liabilities taken over by the U.S. government, the rally lasted one day.
Until the recent U.S. and European measures were announced, there were no rallies at all. When AIG was bailed out to the tune of $85-billion, the market fell 5 per cent. Then, when the $700-billion U.S. rescue package was approved, markets fell another 7 per cent in two days. As authorities in the U.S. and abroad took ever more radical policy steps last week, stock, credit and money markets fell further, day after day.
Do the measures go far enough? When policy actions don't provide real relief to market participants, you know you are one step away from a systemic collapse of the financial and corporate sectors. A vicious circle of deleveraging, plummeting asset prices and margin calls is under way.
So we cannot rule out a systemic failure and global depression. As we have seen in recent days, it will take a big change in economic policy and very radical, co-ordinated action among all economies to avoid disaster. This includes:
* Another rapid round of interest-rate cuts of at least 150 basis points on average globally;
* A temporary blanket guarantee of all deposits while insolvent financial institutions that must be shut are distinguished from distressed but solvent institutions that must be partially nationalized and given injections of public capital;
* A rapid reduction of insolvent households' debt burden, preceded by a temporary freeze on all foreclosures;
* Massive and unlimited provision of liquidity to solvent financial institutions;
* Public provision of credit to the solvent parts of the corporate sector in order to avoid a short-term debt refinancing crisis for solvent but illiquid corporations and small businesses;
* A massive direct government fiscal stimulus that includes public works, infrastructure spending, unemployment benefits, tax rebates to lower-income households, and provision of grants to cash- strapped local governments;
* An agreement between creditor countries running current-account surpluses and debtor countries running current-account deficits to maintain an orderly financing of deficits and a recycling of creditors' surpluses to avoid disorderly adjustment of such imbalances.
Anything short of these co-ordinated actions may lead to a market crash, a global financial meltdown and worldwide depression. The measures adopted by the U.S. and Europe are a start. Now they must finish the job.

Full text: The fund will open a London office as a hub for further expansion and possible tie-ups with sovereign wealth funds
The Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System (OMERS) is further expanding its investment operations globally with an eye to deal making with sovereign wealth funds.
While financial turmoil is forcing some to hunker down, the pension fund is going on the offensive by opening a 20-person office in London as it pushes forward with plans to invest a larger portion of its $52-billion in assets in private markets. The London branch will be a hub from which the fund plans to expand into other regions under the OMERS Worldwide brand.
"We want access to large-scale opportunities and co-investment capital around the world. Locating in London expedites the process and enables us to dip into the local talent pool for professionals with global vision," said president and chief executive officer Michael Nobrega.
One key prize in the expansion for OMERS would be major deals with sovereign wealth funds, the powerful government capital pools that will control an estimated $12.5-trillion (U.S.) by 2015.
The move to London could put OMERS in better position to work with these cash-rich groups. Such deals will help further drive its transformation from passive pension fund into active asset manager, Mr. Nobrega said in an interview.
"The gorillas weren't even on the landscape two or three years ago. ... Now they've become our competitors and they have loads of cash," he said. "Our pivotal point is to be able to find some way of collaborating with them, so we can get pieces of these large, strategic assets, and have some influence over their management. Then we can say that we have arrived."
Arriving means bulking up the fund's investments in areas such as real estate and infrastructure through its Oxford Properties Group and Borealis Infrastructure divisions. OMERS already has $5-billion (Canadian) invested in British assets, including Associated British Ports, Scotia Gas Networks and the Watermark Place office development in London.
It looks like a risky time for any organization to be embarking on an international expansion, let alone a fund that oversees pension money for 380,000 Canadians on behalf of more than 900 employers. In the third quarter of 2008, pension fund investments across Canada tumbled to their worst returns in a decade, dragged lower by an "overwhelming" plunge in the equity markets in September, according to a recent report by Mercer Human Resource Consulting.
However, these conditions underscore the importance of OMERS moving deeper into private investments, Mr. Nobrega said.
"We are weathering the current market crisis largely because we were an early believer in shifting large amounts of capital from public to private markets."
OMERS currently has 30 per cent of its assets invested in private markets, through real estate, infrastructure and private equity investments. The rest is in other asset classes, including public equities and fixed-income investments. The average large pension fund in Europe and North America has a 9-per-cent exposure to private markets, OMERS said.
Its plan is to raise that percentage even further, to 42.5 per cent, as it seeks investments that generate steady cash flow over the long term. These tend to be in industries such as transportation and power transmission, sectors often dominated by near monopolies buffered against economic downturns. Such assets have helped drive the fund's returns, which came in at 8.7 per cent last year, in the top quartile of the country's pension funds, said OMERS chief operating officer John Macdonald.
Some current investments in this area include a 32-per-cent stake in the Bruce Power nuclear facilities, a majority stake in power provider Enwave Energy Corp., and joint ownership of the Detroit River Rail Tunnel.
The current market downturn could yield opportunities for cash-rich investors, Mr. Nobrega said, as public company values fall and leveraged buyers drop out of the running.
"Those that use excessive leverage with no equity will go. Large carried interest and fee structures will exit the market; the market will have no time for that."
OMERS has already moved on one potential opportunity, launching a hostile bid last month for Teranet Income Fund. It also bought out partner Brookfield Properties Corp.'s share of a downtown Toronto office tower this summer, a deal exemplifying the fund's move to manage the properties it owns, rather than being a silent partner.
It's not all easy pickings for OMERS, though. In the case of Teranet, for example, other pension funds may be waiting in the wings with higher offers. That level of competition increases further for global infrastructure assets with more widespread appeal.
Mr. Nobrega said he believes OMERS's track record in certain asset classes will help position it as a good partner to invest with and to help manage acquisitions.
"We have something they need. They need our expertise in real estate, they need our expertise in infrastructure. Big time," he said.

Full text: High-speed Internet's a plus, but providers don't like to roll it out on spec - not that that's halting development
They call it the fourth utility: Wiring for broadband Internet service in urban areas is more or less taken for granted these days, along with hydro, water and gas.
"High-speed access, both in terms of speed and overall capacity, are fundamental prerequisites for certain development decisions," said Franklin Holtforster, president and chief executive officer of Ottawa-based MHPM Project Managers Inc. "Anybody who's got land ... and is looking at it for industrial or commercial use is keen to drag fibre as close to the site as they can."
But the reality is very different in some smaller centres, where broadband availability is patchy to non-existent or businesses are still struggling with painfully slow dial-up service.
"I've been an Internet service provider for 13 years and it boggles my mind how we have come to expect ubiquitous high-speed access everywhere we go, but it's just not true in the rural areas," said Tom Copeland, chairman of the Canadian Association of Internet Providers and president of Eagle.ca in Cobourg, Ont.
Still, that doesn't stop developers from proceeding with rural projects, apparently with the hope that broadband will magically appear, he said. In his region, eastern Ontario's Northumberland County, for example, the carriers - incumbent cable, telephone and hydro companies - aren't automatically running broadband to new developments.
"They're putting up buildings without ensuring they are on the grid ... they just expect the phone company to come along behind them and provide service," Mr. Copeland said.
Phone companies can't always be counted on to offer broadband, even though they may have already wired the buildings for phone service, he said. "The reason we're not seeing the phone companies put a big push on it is simply that [customer base] critical mass isn't yet there."
The cost of running broadband depends on the situation. Running wire to a commercial development could cost about $15,000 a kilometre, Mr. Copeland said. Usually, residential demand drives the rollout of broadband because a subdivision might have scores of new customers. A carrier might not want to invest in servicing a low-density office building or a strip mall with only a handful of tenants, he said.
Whether developers, landlords or tenants are making investment decisions based on broadband availability is a chicken and egg type of question. Commercial land is more appealing if it has access to broadband, but the major carriers are reluctant to wire buildings on spec.
"Having a lot of bandwidth and high-speed broadband connectivity is another piece of infrastructure that you can add to the virtues of undeveloped land, along with a long list of other attributes, like an educated work force, water and power." Mr. Holtforster said. "I wouldn't go so far as to say that if it were only for broadband access, [rural areas] would be doing a lot better, but it makes [Canada] more broadly competitive by making more of the population available to work."
Ottawa is helping local governments improve their public infrastructure, including broadband, through the $33-billion Building Canada plan. The broadband part of the program favours projects that will boost economic development and improve online access to things such as government services, education and health information.
Some provinces already have their own programs, including Ontario, where about 500,000 people in rural southern areas of the province do not have broadband access. Last year, through the Rural Connections Broadband Program, the province distributed $10-million to 18 municipalities so that they could wire households, small and medium-size businesses and local municipal offices. Ontario, which has identified the eastern and southern parts of the province as priorities, is committing another $30-million to the program over four years.
Mr. Copeland said carriers such as Bell Canada, Rogers Communications Inc., Videotron Telecom Ltee and Ontario's Hydro One Inc. have already strung main fibre-optic lines on the Windsor, Ont., to Quebec City corridor, primarily along the Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd. and Canadian National Railway Co. lines, as well as highways 401 and 7.
"The problem for some of the rural communities is there is no break-out point in the fibre," Mr. Copeland said. "It's expensive enough that the carriers just aren't putting a splice in their fibre at every little village that the tracks run through."
Still, broadband is just one of a long list of reasons a commercial developer may have for investing in a community, said Mark Kindrachuk, president and chief executive officer of Toronto developer Intermarket Group.
"I don't think it would be the sole driver. ... There are a lot of boxes that need to be ticked off before you get to that one," Mr. Kindrachuk said. "For retailers, it's nice to have access, but it's not that huge an issue. Industrial, even less. So the real user is an office user and, frankly, [broadband] wouldn't trigger someone to go into a community."
Unlike about eight years ago, when the major carriers raced to wire office complexes occupied by huge broadband users such as banks and accounting and law firms, there is less incentive now, unless there is a decent return on investment, said Michael Brooks, chief executive officer of the Real Property Association of Canada.
"Now companies have much less capital or are much more risk averse, and they're not going to just go into a building and wire it up on spec," he said. "If broadband is not there, it's because the provider doesn't think there's a market."
Mr. Brooks isn't convinced commercial developers are shunning smaller centres based on broadband access. If a tenant wants it badly enough, getting broadband installed is usually a matter of calling a provider and writing a large cheque, he said.
"I think it's all about the physical real estate for developers because most of them assume they can get the broadband pipe to their building - one way or another."
Getting wired
How broadband service is delivered to businesses in smaller communities depends on terrain and distance from a main line, says Tom Copeland, chairman of the Canadian Association of Internet Providers.
Phone, cable and, in some cases, local hydro companies will run broadband cable wherever there are enough users to achieve an acceptable return on investment, Mr. Copeland said. From there, communities usually partner with local businesses and Internet service providers to build the network out and hook up customers.
Most of the networks being deployed in rural areas are a combination of fibre and wireless, Mr. Copeland said. "They may pull fibre to a central hub and from there [fibre or wireless signals would go] out to remote hubs or to the end customer."
However, in hilly terrain, towers are erected to relay signals to one another, which can be expensive.
When communities are able to offset infrastructure costs with government funding programs, return on investment is less of an impediment, Mr. Copeland said. "Municipalities, hopefully, are going to make the investment in broadband infrastructure similar to the way they historically have in things like water, sewers, electricity, roads and railway."

Full text: TimberWest aims to turn 166 hectares of former forest land just north of Courtenay into a series of medium-sized farms
One of Vancouver Island's largest logging companies has decided to stop cutting wood and start growing food on some of its Comox Valley land holdings.
Citing factors such as high real-estate prices, plummeting lumber sales and growing demand for local agricultural products, TimberWest has applied to turn 166 hectares of former forest land just north of Courtenay into a series of medium-sized farms.
"When you look at how the Island has changed over the last five or 10 years, you realize you can make way more money off this land than just growing trees on it," TimberWest spokesman Stephen Bruyneel said. "We started looking at this three years ago, even before the downturn in the forest industry."
While the land has been earmarked for timber harvesting for decades, it lies within the Agricultural Land Reserve, limiting the chances of residential development but allowing for a range of agricultural uses, including organic farming, greenhouses, wineries and agricultural tourism.
Market research conducted by TimberWest indicated a strong demand for locally grown agricultural products, in part to supply new restaurants catering to retiring baby boomers who have settled in the area in recent years, Mr. Bruyneel said.
"If you look at Comox and the kind of boutique agriculture that's going on, we really think that's going to drive up the value of the land," he said.
The 166 hectares of land is made up of 11 parcels that TimberWest wants to subdivide into "different lot configurations" to facilitate drainage work aimed at improving the area's farming potential.
"We have to prove to the land commission we are increasing the net agricultural value of the land," Mr. Bruyneel said.
John Watson, executive director of Invest Comox Valley, said an influx of fifty-something retirees in recent years and the popularity of eat-local concepts such as the 100-mile diet have created a niche for Comox Valley agricultural products "It's partly why we have one of the strongest farmers markets on the Island," Mr. Watson said.
But TimberWest's bid to liquidate its land assets extends far beyond a handful of farms in the Comox Valley.
With about 325,000 hectares of private land, in addition to its 700,000 cubic metres of renewable Crown logging rights, TimberWest is Vancouver Island's largest private landowner.
A 2007 study identified about 54,000 hectares of TimberWest land as capable of supporting "new, sustainable land management opportunities."
Early in 2007, TimberWest donated a 16-hectare parcel near its proposed farm lots for the site of a proposed regional hospital for the North Island.
Last July, the company received rezoning approval for a 166-hectare parcel of land near the Campbell River airport that can now be sold off for industrial use.
Mr. Bruyneel said much of TimberWest's private land lies on the outskirts of growing Vancouver Island communities with attractive development opportunities. Some of the most coveted land lies on the outskirts of Ladysmith, a seaside community between Duncan and Nanaimo.
Long-term plans include a recreational and residential development in the Nanaimo Lakes area, about 35 kilometres southwest of Nanaimo, Mr. Bruyneel said.
"Nanaimo Lakes I would say is at least five years away," he said.
A report released earlier this month by PricewaterhouseCoopers estimated that Canada's forest industry lost more than $1-billion in the first half of 2008, with Western Canada accounting for about half that figure.
About 100 people attended an open house Thursday in the community of Merville, near the proposed farm lots.
Mr. Bruyneel said TimberWest plans to take the feedback it received, refine its development plans and make another presentation to the community later this winter.
However, with more than 80 per cent of its land still earmarked for forestry, Mr. Bruyneel said TimberWest isn't about to abandon the logging industry.
"We are still going to be a timber company at the core," he said.

Full text: Big banks that want more capital usually turn to institutional investors, private-equity firms and sovereign-wealth funds. Some small U.S. banks are going door-to-door in their hometowns.
John Maxwell, chairman and chief executive of John Marshall Bank in Falls Church, Va., raised $22-million (U.S.) from a tow-truck driver, beekeeper, pallet maker and 426 other local investors, who pitched in an average of about $50,000 apiece.
"My brother turned me down," says the 48-year-old Mr. Maxwell, who had better luck with his parents and two sisters. "He said he needed the cash."
Since completing the stock sale in June, the two-year-old bank has opened a second branch. Mr. Maxwell expects the bank to become profitable in 2009, despite the industry's worsening turmoil.
It's a throwback to the classic film It's a Wonderful Life , in which residents of the fictional Bedford Falls plunk down their savings to help beloved George Bailey rescue the foundering Bailey Building & Loan Association. John Marshall Bank's original branch sits at the corner of a suburban shopping centre, sandwiched between a Jackson Hewitt tax office and a Latin American chicken restaurant. The section of Falls Church where the bank is located is known as Bailey's Crossroads - after the famous circus family that once lived there, not Jimmy Stewart's heroic character in the 1946 movie.
Last week, Bank of America Corp. raised $10-billion in a stock offering pitched at big investors. Wells Fargo & Co. has said it plans a $20-billion offering as part of its pending takeover of Wachovia Corp. But with only so much capital to go around, especially in a market gripped by fear, small banks are looking for money in their own backyards.
In March, TIB Financial Corp., Sarasota, Fla., which has suffered three consecutive quarterly net losses because of its exposure to the Florida real-estate market, got $10.1-million from the Collier and Lutgert families. Both are local real-estate dynasties dating back to the 1920s, when advertising tycoon Barron Collier bought 1.3 million acres of land that opened part of southwestern Florida to development. The surrounding county is named for Mr. Collier.
"It's certainly good to have it, given the current conditions," says Stephen Gilhooly, TIB's chief financial officer. The bank has 20 branches.
Shopping-centre developer Jon Wheeler of Virginia Beach, Va., didn't hesitate when the CFO of Monarch Financial Holdings Inc. called to ask if he would invest in the Chesapeake, Va., bank-holding company. Mr. Wheeler offered $250,000 and has no regrets. "To me, it is a very sound investment," Mr. Wheeler says. Monarch has largely avoided the mortgage mess so far, reporting its highest-ever profit in the second quarter.
"Are you sure this is really a good time to do this?" Steve Feinberg's wife asked when he told her that he wanted to sink $25,000 into Heritage Bank, a New York bank set to open later this month. Mr. Feinberg, chief creative officer at an advertising agency, won her over by saying that small banks like Heritage are in better shape than "poorly positioned" banking and securities giants.
"There are banks that are going away, and there are banks whose reputations have been tarnished, and there are those that are distracted and can't focus on their own clients," he says.
At John Marshall, the "Brother, can you spare a dime?" strategy began this past November. Mr. Maxwell, who worked as a bank janitor in high school and a teller in college, was negotiating to take a controlling stake in Security One Bank. Launched in 2006 to cater to northern Virginia's large Hispanic population, the bank wasn't growing fast enough and was burning through its $15-million capital base.
In February, Mr. Maxwell and former colleagues from another community bank he sold for $144-million eight years after starting it with $7.5-million struck a deal to buy Security One with $6.8-million of their own money. They renamed the bank after Mr. Marshall, the Virginia statesman and celebrated 19th-century U.S. chief justice.
To turn a profit, John Marshall Bank needs to increase its assets to about $160-million from the current $93-million. So Mr. Maxwell and the bank's directors started dialling for dollars.
For two months, they solicited high-school buddies and hosted wine-and-cheese receptions for local business owners. Michael Foster, an architect who helped form Mr. Marshall's previous bank, whittled a list of 100 potential targets down to 25 people. "I would not put any money in that you need to take care of your family for the next 30 months," Mr. Foster says he warned.
Dan Price, who raises honeybees and says he knows nothing about banks, got a call from Mark Moore, a bank officer he has known for 25 years. Jen Sterling heard about the bank from someone she knows through the chamber of commerce. John Britt, owner of a pallet-making company, caught the banking bug from a friend of a friend. They all invested.
Given the financial crisis, Mr. Maxwell is relieved the bank raised the money when it did. "I would like to think we would be able to raise it today, but I know it would be a lot harder."

Full text: Farmer and self-taught linguist, he lived in one of the oldest houses in the province and used organic, crop-rotation methods of the Old Country. His farm was the last of 400 in the area
Aloysius O'Brien's life and vocations composed a template of the Irish presence in Newfoundland. His mother's family came from Waterford and his father's family from Kilkenny. A farmer, he used the organic, crop-rotation methods of the Old Country and he successfully preserved his old world property from real-estate development. A linguist, he taught himself a Gaelic dialect that, while still the genesis of many Newfoundland words, is now extinguished in the province and has likely fully died out with his passing.
He was a devout Roman Catholic and had learned religion and Irish history from his schooling with the Irish Christian Brothers. His interest in Irish culture went beyond his deep commitment to the language, and he was so steeped in the Irish-Newfoundland traditions and transitions of the late 19th and 20th centuries he was a walking primary resource for researchers and filmmakers.
But Gaelic was his strongest passion. It was what the Irish immigrants had spoken. In the early 19th century it was the predominant language on the Avalon Peninsula, and Gaelic-speaking priests were favoured by some local congregations. To this day, pockets of Newfoundland sport an accent seemingly straight from Ireland, but it was never a written language or taught in schools. It was almost entirely out of use by the end of the First World War, although such current Newfoundland parlance as "hangashore," "scrawb" and "gob" are Gaelic in origin, and in the 1980s folklorists were still finding singers in St. Mary's Bay, on the southern Avalon Peninsula, who could belt out songs in Gaelic. Many Newfoundlanders also know the old Irish name for Newfoundland: Talamh Au Eisch , or "Land of the Fish."
Mr. O'Brien's paternal grandmother, Bridget Conway, had spoken Gaelic, but his father did not. Mr. O'Brien was fascinated by his family's Irish history and traditions and determined to conserve them. He taught himself Leinster Gaelic, also called Irish of the Books, ordering language records and cassette tapes advertised in magazines, and reading booklets published by Father Eugene O'Growney, a priest who laboured to record and protect the Irish language.
"I am not fluent in the language, either," Mr. O'Brien once said. "To be fluent with it you must be immersed in it." But such immersion was no longer possible.
In 1970, Dr. Richard Walsh, a visiting Irish professor, gave a lecture on Gaelic at Memorial University of Newfoundland. Mr. O'Brien attended, but his own knowledge was so extensive and so obvious that he was soon the one behind the podium, leading night courses. While a teacher, he remained a farmer. In a quaint overlap, one evening's class was postponed when all hands went to search from some cows that had strayed from the farm.
Aly O'Brien was the youngest of three boys born to Denis O'Brien and Margaret (English). (Serendipitously, his birthday was June 16, which is known as Bloomsday in homage to Leopold Bloom, James Joyce's protagonist in Ulysses .) Neither he nor his older brothers John and Mike ever married and they spent their entire lives in Thimble Cottage, which may be the oldest dwelling on the Avalon Peninsula (the land deed dates to 1843). He attended school at St. Patrick's Hall, topping off his curriculum with a year of Latin. He finished with formal education in 1931 but, a true polymath, never stopped learning, and never stinted on sharing his knowledge on Irish-Newfoundland history and agriculture.
The O'Briens were a famed St. John's farming family. Their Oxen Pond Road Farm on Nagle's Hill was a city fixture more than 150 years old. The lovely, cozy and well-made 19th-century farmhouse was built by their great-great grandfather John O'Brien, with two stories in front, a roof sloping to one story in back, low ceilings, a hearth big enough to sit in, hand-hewn ceiling beams and French doors opening onto an apple orchard. The area is not known for its arable land (not much of Newfoundland is) and John O'Brien spent 30 years scraping the rock from 14 acres.
Thimble Cottage had survived the 1892 fire, which, according to St. John's songwriter Johnny Burke, started at the O'Briens' barn. The farm was the last of 400 that had once operated in St. John's. By the 1980s, it was 11 hectares, with 20 worked by the O'Brien brothers.
Aly O'Brien worked on the private, ceremonial gardens of such local merchant families such as the Bairds, and then at the Memorial University Botanical Gardens near the farm, while John, the eldest, was a master carpenter, and Mike, the middle brother, was employed by importer-wholesaler Charles R. Bell Ltd. They grew and sold hay and vegetables and produced milk and homemade butter.
When it was founded, Oxen Pond Farm was some distance from the city, but today it is surrounded by suburbs and adjacent to the Avalon Mall and the Health Sciences Complex, the province's largest hospital. The O'Briens fought development and expropriation and turned down multi-million dollar offers for their acreage, holding on to their memories of how the valley had been once fruitfully harvested, before the urban encroachment came.
"It was all farmland," Aly O'Brien once said. "And in the gardens of most homes, there were apple trees, rhubarb and small fruits - strawberries, raspberries and currants. That was the environment we knew for half our lives. Then the developers cleared away every last bush and every tree near our boundaries. It was a terrible-looking sight."
Their firm resolve against municipal development and commitment to their history was heralded by many in St. John's. In one act of protest, documented in Harrowsmith Country Life Magazine, Aly O'Brien heard rumours that some of their land would be expropriated for roadwork, and began a Japanese garden in the endangered area. It had walkways, flowers, fern borders and rechannelled streams paced with stones. It was not just designed as a beautiful space, but also as a sign the land was being used. No roadwork commenced.
Concurrent to his agricultural work, he had pursued his linguistic education. Indeed the two interests balanced his days. "My way of life has been demanding physically," he said, "but I have kept at the studies."
Right after high school, to continue and expand his knowledge of languages, he took correspondence courses, ordering cassette tapes and textbooks through the mail, and he could read and speak some French, Spanish and Greek, as well as produce the Latin base of all the considerable flora and fauna he knew from his work. "Nearly all the languages of Europe come from one stem, which is Indo-European in most cases," he once explained. "I had a fair amount of Latin in my upbringing so, since more dialects are derived from Latin, I can often understand what is being said."
In 1982 he was awarded an honorary degree from Memorial University in St. John's for his work in horticulture and Irish Gaelic. "I always thought of Aly as that little piece of St. John's who lived in the hills," said MUN Professor Shane O'Dea, who introduced Mr. O'Brien at that convocation. "He was rooted immensely deeply in that land."
As a farmer and linguist he was often interviewed, both in the province and across the country and in Ireland - but that wasn't his only time in the spotlight. He was also an actor, appearing in several local CBC-TV productions, and he was featured in the highly popular documentary series Land and Sea . He had a great presence, his charm and amiability coming straight through the microphone or camera lens.
"He was like a man from an earlier time," said Eleanor Dawson, the Director of Arts for the provincial government. "He was gentle and soft spoken with a lilting voice."
In 1992 Thimble Cottage was designated a registered heritage structure.

Aloysius Patrick O'Brien was born in St. John's on June 16, 1915. He died there on Aug. 6, 2008. He was 93. Predeceased by his brothers, he leaves several cousins.

From subprime to stock swoon

Abstract: Some European banks have U.S. operations that have been hit by the subprime crisis, while others have assets backed by U.S. mortgages. At the same time, the real estate market in some European countries has been depressed because of worries over a recession, and this has damaged mortgage lenders.

Full text: This whole downward spiral seemed to start with U.S. subprime mortgages. What exactly are they? Subprime mortgages are home loans made to people who would not, under normal circumstances, be ideal candidates to get a mortgage - thus they are "subprime." These are individuals who have a higher risk of defaulting on their loan, such as those who have been delinquent in making payments in the past, or people with a bankruptcy on their credit record, or those who simply don't have a credit history.
Starting around 2005, U.S. lenders loosened their rules and began granting mortgages to borrowers who provided very little evidence of their income and ability to repay. Many of these mortgages had very low initial interest rates, for the first six months to three years, but when that period ended the payments jumped sharply. Borrowers were led to believe that they would be able to refinance their homes at this point because the value of the property would have increased. But the slump in the housing market meant that didn't happen. As a result many people - especially those who had not been completely frank about their income levels - defaulted on their mortgages and lost their homes. What is the "money market," and why does it matter if it freezes? The money market is made up short-term loans (generally of less than one year), such as certificates of deposit, commercial paper, banker's acceptances, and 30-day treasury bills.
If the money market freezes up - in other words, no one wants to make short-term loans because they are worried about borrowers defaulting - companies cannot get the cash they need to pay staff, buy supplies, or pay rent. Often companies need to borrow this money because they are waiting for revenue that may not arrive for a few days or weeks.
But if they can't get short-term cash from the money markets, it can make day-to-day operations very difficult. If our banking system and mortgage lending practices are more stable than in the U.S., why do the Canadian dollar and TSX continue to go down? The precipitous drop in the stock markets now seems to have little to do with fundamentals. It is tied to the fear and panic gripping investors. People appear to think the world is going to move into a broad recession, and companies are going to suffer as a result. If the U.S. economy shrinks because of the credit crisis it will inevitably hurt Canadian firms who export across the border. And while our banks seem to be strong, they too are having trouble getting - and giving - short-term credit, which could slow growth of companies here.
The Canadian dollar is likely reacting to the fall in crude oil and commodity prices. As Philips, Hager & North's chief economist Patricia Croft noted, the loonie is still regarded on world markets as something of a "petro-currency."
What is the problem with the banks in Europe, since they haven't had a subprime mortgage crisis? Some European banks have U.S. operations that have been hit by the subprime crisis, while others have assets backed by U.S. mortgages. At the same time, the real estate market in some European countries has been depressed because of worries over a recession, and this has damaged mortgage lenders. On top of all this, many big European banks operate in several countries, but there is no pan-European rescue package that can be used to help them out if they are in danger of failing and their home-country governments aren't up to the task. Do interest rate cuts actually help boost the stock market? In theory, they should. If an investor is trying to make a decision between putting money into a bond or a stock, he or she will look at the difference between the yield on the bond and the possible return on the stock. Bond yields should fall when interest rates go down, making stocks more attractive. Essentially, for a stock to compete for an investor's money, it doesn't need to offer as high a rate of return.
However, bond yields do not always follow central bank interest rate cuts, and they haven't this time. Some very high-quality corporate bonds, for example, are offering huge yields compared with the stock market.
While lower interest rates should also make corporate borrowing easier and thus lower costs and finance growth, that hasn't been happening either in the current credit crunch.
On top of all this, worries over a recession or panic over falling stocks can trump any minor tweaking of interest rates.
***
WHAT ARE FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC? WHY THE CUTE NAMES?
Fannie Mae is the nickname of the Federal National Mortgage Association, while Freddie Mac is the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
Fannie Mae is the older of the two. It was created as a government agency in 1938 under U.S. president Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal. The idea was to give local banks federal money to finance home mortgages, since private lenders were leery of lending money. The government wanted to help more people buy homes, and encourage the building of affordable housing. In 1968 it became a private company.
Freddie Mac was set up in 1970 to expand the secondary mortgage market, and ensure there was competition with Fannie Mae's monopoly. Both companies buy loans from banks or mortgage firms, and re-sell these as mortgage-backed securities. Together they own or guarantee about half of U.S. mortgages.
The two were put under "conservatorship" by the U.S. Federal Housing Finance Agency on Sept. 7 - essentially a takeover by the government.

Abstract: "Well, I don't know," [Maisie Wallace] said in a faintly exasperated tone. "That much." She tossed a piece of white packaged pork fat onto the table - an inch thick, three inches by six inches in area. It looked disgusting. "It's not good for you. But I keep it frozen, because it's easier to cut that way."

Full text: Disclaimer: Newfoundland pork buns may increase the chance of a heart attack or stroke that can lead to death. Common side effects include drowsiness, intense pleasure and muscle and joint pain from fighting your way to the pork-bun plate before that guy in the down vest scarfs the last one. Side effects diminish with the cessation of consumption, which in turn can produce feelings of deprivation and sadness .
Behold the Newfoundland pork bun. That was my plan, anyway. Or to put it another, less alimentary way, so I can come across as an intellectual: How do you travel to an unknown land and discover its memorable secrets, in a ruthlessly competitive age when everything feels pre-discovered? How do you earn the confidence of the locals and take the true pulse of a place without coming across as a pushy, and in the case of pork buns, greedy come-from-away?
One trick, fellow traveller, is to follow the food.
Perhaps I should begin at the beginning. Your correspondent spent 11 days this summer attending the Writers at Woody Point arts festival. Woody Point, population 500, is halfway up the west, less-visited coast of Newfoundland, in Gros Morne National Park, home to fine hiking, Gros Morne mountain, the famous Tablelands (one of two places on the planet where the Earth's mantle has broken through its crust like an overstuffed pie), excellent fishing and kayaking and swimming (fresh and saltwater), and of course the festival itself, which featured a full net of performances by the likes of actor Gordon Pinsent and screenwriter and demon fiddler Des Walsh and a two-night reunion of Figgy Duff, the more-or-less famous band that kicked off a revival of traditional Newfoundland music in the 1970s.
As for the Newfoundland pork bun, there was an opening-night barbecue. An hour into the happiness, your correspondent noticed a commotion at the food table. Not one to shy away from food that attracts crowds, he battled his way into the melee, employing a leap-and-fall action he had seen a humpback whale perform that afternoon in nearby Bonne Bay. He beached in front of a plate of small, two-inch, cake-like things, evidently browned in the oven. They appeared to contain raisins. Your correspondent reached out and popped one in his mouth.
Time stopped. Or if it didn't actually stop, it slowed considerably, sat down, put up its feet and said, "Ah!" The bun was ... what was it? There was a savoury taste to it, set off against the sweetness of the raisins and the faintly caramelized surface. There was a crispness to it, and chewiness, and a bacony hint; it was cakey but not cake. It was unlike anything your correspondent had ever tasted. He heaved back into the fray for another, but by then they were gone.
"What were those?" he said to no one in particular.
"Those were Maisie Wallace's pork buns," someone said. " Were being the operative word."
Lardy cake's legacy
Most adventuresome eaters, when they hear the term pork bun, immediately think of cha siu bao , the famous Chinese delicacy - dough wrapped artistically around spiced pork, and either steamed (in which case they resemble tiny white clouds) or baked (in which case they are neat and brown and round). The Shanghai model, sheng jian bao , are pan-fried.
The Newfoundland pork bun is none of these. In fact, it isn't a bun at all, deriving as it does from a traditional English specialty, the lardy cake. In Suffolk, on the southeast coast of England (and where pig farming is a mainstay), lardy cakes are known as fourses, after the time of afternoon they were and still are eaten on holidays and feast days, with a side of tea.
Still, as a name for something you want someone to eat, even the faintly pornographic pork bun is a big improvement on lardy cake. Lardy cake sounds like something one might hear in the course of a bitter domestic argument, not that I'd know anything about that.
Half an hour later, having been introduced to any number of good and healthy Newfoundland talkers - they outnumbered the pork buns by a wide margin - your correspondent was introduced to a woman with blond hair who said her name was Maisie.
"Maisie?" Your correspondent perked up. "The Maisie who made those little cakes?"
"The pork buns. I did, yes."
"Can you give me the recipe?" I admit it was a daringly aggressive question right out of the gate. A stranger from Toronto asking that question in a small town is likely to get the answer "Not on your life, buddy," after which further conversation can be strained. But Maisie didn't look like someone who was easily offended.
"They're easy. You just - oh, look, I can't tell you. You'll have to come and watch me do it."
"And when will you be doing it next?" I admit I hoped the answer would be: "In 10 minutes."
"Oh, gosh. I don't know. I haven't really planned any."
"Well," I said, assuming my most casual and offhand manner, "if you were going to make them, and I wouldn't be in the way, I'd love to watch."
By now Maisie was eyeing me the way she might look at someone she suspected of being the new second-storey man in town.
"Because," I added hastily, "you know, they're very good." Then the full press: "We don't have anything like them in Toronto." Open, but not too eager; insistent, but not insane; flattering, but not fatuous. It's bad enough to be a tourist, much less a pushy, recipe-plundering tourist.
"I suppose I have to make some for Robert and Peter's party on Saturday afternoon," Maisie sighed, at last. "You'd better come over Saturday morning. About 9:30."
She left it to me to find out where she lived.
Talking through it
Days went by. I hiked up and down Gros Morne mountain, up and down the Tablelands, up and down the Green Gardens loop by the sea, up and down the Lookout. If there is a 10-foot stretch of Newfoundland that is flat and not pocked with stones, I did not find it. I ate pan-fried fresh cod and cod tongues and scallops every night, but never grew tired of them. I saw moose. (Ten people had died that summer running into moose on the roads.)
Mostly I listened to people talk. Newfoundlanders occasionally pretend to be immune to the rest of the world (west coast Newfoundlanders claim not to care even about goings-on in St. John's, on the other side of the island), but as far as conversation goes, Newfoundland is the Manhattan of Canada.
I met doctors who talked about recent neurological findings regarding serotonin uptake, and retired teachers who talked about rug-hooking and real estate. Randall Maggs, a professor of English literature at Sir Wilfred Grenfell College, had written Night Work , a book of poems about the troubled hockey goalie Terry Sawchuk; we chatted mostly about skiing. His son Dave, a PhD student (environmental sustainability), concert pianist and founder of the brilliant Gros Morne Summer Music quartet, recommended (among other things) Buzz Hollings's book Panarchy , which is about ... well, a new framework for understanding and restructuring evolving human-natural hierarchical systems, as a way of fending off the end of the natural world.
The point is, if you don't want to be intellectually bored while you quietly think about what you plan to eat next, you could do worse (no matter what Stephen Harper says) than attend an arts festival in the middle of nowhere in western Newfoundland.
'What are you doing here?'
Eventually Saturday rolled around. Maisie's house was a trim and elegant bit of work on four acres of oceanfront that she and her husband, Lou, a retired insurance man, picked up a few years ago for $10,000. I showed up at 9:30 a.m. to find her drinking blueberry wine with friends from Corner Brook, a town 45 minutes to the south. Gordon Pinsent was asleep upstairs in the guest room.
While Maisie ran off to see if he was stirring (very little about Gordon Pinsent is not), two of her guests, Elaine Brown and Ann Casey, a teacher and a nurse, cornered me on the wraparound deck.
"And what are you doing here?" Ann asked.
"I, um ... I've come to learn how Maisie makes pork buns," I said.
"Couldn't you have done that over the phone?"
"Well, yes," I said. "I could have. But you know how good cooks can be. I didn't want her to tell me the recipe and then leave out a crucial ingredient, the way some cooks do. My mother, for instance, is 93 and has yet to reveal the entire recipe for her bread sauce. And it only has four ingredients."
That got their attention. The two women immediately began to confer.
"Maisie's pork buns, are they fried out?" Ann said.
No," Elaine said. "Baked. They're some good."
I could be wrong, but I thought I caught a glint of disbelief in Ann's eye as to the brilliance of Maisie's pork buns, if only in relation to her own.
Then Elaine began a story about a Newfoundland aunt who made the most delicious, dark fruitcake. She asked for the recipe, and did what she was told, but it wasn't the same. "And I'm a good cook. When I grew up, baking was like breathing." It was only after an entire year of intense investigation that she discovered her aunt had neglected to mention she used gravy browning to lend the cake its colour and flavour . "Gravy browning! Who would have thought of that?" Elaine said.
"Hmmmph," said Ann, but I could tell she was tucking it away.
They left shortly thereafter, and suddenly Maisie and I were at it. It was a brilliant, shiny day outside, the sun skipping across the water like a school of mackerel waiting to be caught.
"You take the pork fatback," Maisie began.
"How much pork fat?" I countered. I wasn't letting her get away with any vagueness.
"Well, I don't know," Maisie said in a faintly exasperated tone. "That much." She tossed a piece of white packaged pork fat onto the table - an inch thick, three inches by six inches in area. It looked disgusting. "It's not good for you. But I keep it frozen, because it's easier to cut that way."
She proceeded to show me how to cut the pork fat in thin, eighth-of-an-inch slices, down to but not through the rind. Then she told me to do the same again across the first set of cuts, at right angles. "Here, you do it, because this is the part I don't like."
With a perfect grid in place, Maisie cut the pork fat off the rind and then placed the lard dice in a large bowl. I could see all the way down her property to her shoreside fishing shack, where Newfoundlanders like to dry the cod they're still allowed to jig for family eating.
"You set the oven for 400 degrees." She did this. "Then you put the kettle on to boil, with lots of water. It has to be boiling." She did this too. "Then you take flour - "
"How much flour?"
"I don't know," she said. "This much." I counted 6½ cups. For someone who didn't know how much flour, she certainly knew when, exactly, to stop - she could have been titrating nitro, she was measuring so carefully. The flour went into the bowl over the tiny dice of fat. "Then some raisins."
"How many rai - "
"I don't know, a packet's worth." I snuck a look at the packet: 250 grams, boyo.
"Now you mix the flour and the raisins and the fat up." She looked at me. "Go on, do it. You have to see how it feels. That's the only way to know."
I washed my hands and plunged them into the dusty, fatty stir. It felt, appropriately, like cellulite.
Meanwhile, Maisie was talking about an aunt visiting from Burgeo, on the south coast, where Maisie had grown up the youngest of 15 children. Five died right away and 10 survived. There was no road into Burgeo; the only contact the village had with the outside world was via the mail boat that stopped by twice a week.
We turned back to the buns. "Now into the oven?" I asked.
"No, you still have to grease the cookie sheet. Vegetable oil, though butter or shortening if you want."
This, I did. I like to think I did a good job, but I might have been slightly obsessive.
"Then what I like to do is, I cut the leftover pork rind into little pieces" - Maisie proceeded to slice the slippery, revolting rind into quarter-inch squares - "and put them out on the cookie sheet, as much as you have. Those are for special. People who know pork buns look for the extra square of fat underneath." This was the real McCoy, the sort of secret trick one does not normally learn unless one dares to dig for the most intimate culinary intimacies.
"They're really good," Maisie said. "Then you take the boiling water - it has to be boiling - and you stir it into the flour. That melts the pork fat. Go on. And you add more if necessary."
I was about to ask how much more, but I realized it might drive her over the edge. It was the crucial moment. Secretly, I measured: Two cups of boiling water. "But you still want it quite dry," Maisie said.
I stirred. It was quite dry. I felt like a 12th-century apothecary.
"Now comes the fun part. You have to butter your hands." I did so. "More than that." By now, I had half a cup of butter on my paws. "And then you make them into little patties."
I formed one.
Maisie shot me a look. "That's too big."
It was harder than it looked. The batter was sticky and gluey, and the dough didn't hold. I made a bun, then another. I placed them on the sheet. Maisie's buns seemed perfect, smooth little creations two inches across. Mine looked like small tantrums. "Look at yours," she said. "That's not very good."
I applied more butter. The problem was that I was urban: I was treating the pork buns like gourmet hamburgers, to be handled as little as possible. In Toronto, the big internationalized city, handling was bad. In Newfoundland, where they make their own rules, the more handling the better.
I refashioned every bun I made. We popped them in the oven for an hour at 400 degrees. Then we had to wait.
A matter of context
"Let me show you the shack," Maisie said, and we walked down a curving wooden walkway to the water. She was talking by then - making a meal together will do that.
I imagined coming from a big family somehow softened fate and bad luck: One sibling dies, but there are still nine left. But the problem with a big family is that when they start to go, they really go. Maisie's brother Clyde still lives in Woody Point, where he's the publisher of Breakwater Books. But they had lost three sisters, their mother and a brother-in-law in a single year. "But everybody has something, some grief," she said. "You just get through it."
Then she pointed out over the water to a spot where she had recently jigged a 20-pound cod. Her son Greg, who's a chef in Las Vegas, had cooked it up on his last visit.
We walked back to the house and Maisie heated up some leftover cod tongues, cod and halibut for my breakfast, served with her homemade tomato and onion pickle. Half an hour in, we flipped the pork buns. A half-hour after that, they were golden brown, and done. She let me have one - and only one - hot out of the oven.
I have to say: Good food is good food, but great food is always a matter of context. A hot dog from a stand on Fifth Avenue in New York, after a day of walking; lamb Wellington, after an afternoon of anticipation in Paris; a pork bun in Woody Point, after a morning of labour. They are the same glory.
The bun was still searing hot in my mouth when Gordon Pinsent came down from his nap. "Hurro," I said, breathing steam and incapable of closing my mouth. "Ah jus' luhnd ta ma' pok buhs."
"Ah well," the great actor said. "You haven't lived until you've had a pork bun."
I have to agree. Not that I've had one since. By the time I got to the party that afternoon, they were gone.

Maisie Wallace's
Newfoundland
Pork Buns
INGREDIENTS
1 3-by-6-inch packet pork fatback, roughly 1 inch thick, semi-frozen
1 kettleful (at least two cups) of boiling water
61/2 cups flour
250 grams dark raisins
Vegetable oil, butter or shortening for greasing baking sheet and hands
INSTRUCTIONS
Turn oven on at 400 degrees (F).
While fatback is still semi-gelid, make a series of 1/8-inch wide parallel lengthwise cuts in the pork fat, down to, but not through, the pork rind.
Repeat crosswise, also at intervals of 1/8-inch, down to but not through the rind.
Carefully slice the pork fatback off the rind into a large mixing bowl, reserving the rind.
Cut the rind into quarter-inch squares and set aside.
Add flour and raisins to pork-fat dice, and with bare hands mix thoroughly until raisins and pork-fat dice are well coated.
Grease large cookie sheet generously with oil or butter or shortening.
(Optional) Place small squares of pork rind, as many as you have, on cookie sheet at two-inch intervals. (There will be space left over on the cookie sheet.)
Add two cups boiling water to flour/fat/raisin mixture. Stir with wooden spoon to thoroughly mix and melt pork fat, but keep mixture quite dry.
Grease hands liberally with butter and form dough into round patties 2 inches in diameter and a scant 1 inch high. Patties should be well formed.
Place patties on greased baking sheet an inch or two apart, one pattie on top of each square of rind, until the rind squares run out (remaining patties will have no rind square).
Bake at 400 degrees for one half-hour; flip the patties and bake for a half-hour more, or until pork buns are golden brown.
Serve warm or at room temperature.

LOT SIZE: 42 by 125 feet
DAYS ON THE MARKET: 52
LISTING AGENT: Mike Zafiris, Realty Toronto Inc.
This 2,560-square foot house is one of the few smaller properties in the prestigious Upper Thornhill Estates community in Vaughan, where homes average between 3,000- and 3,500 square feet of living space, but can go up 4,000 square feet, says local agent Mike Zafiris.
But aside from its comparatively small size, it has several redeeming qualities, such as a premium 42-foot lot in a family-filled neighbourhood.
"It widens to 45 feet, and one side is as deep as 125 feet," Mr. Zafiris says, explaining that the backyard seems even deeper because the property behind it sits on an even larger plot of land.
"Most of the 42-foot wide homes have a standard 42 by 110 [foot measurement]."
To the side of the double garage, double mahogany doors open to a foyer with hardwood floors and crown moulding that flows throughout, from the powder room to the living room.
The dining room features French doors and coffered ceilings, while a gas fireplace provides the focus of the family room.
The eat-in kitchen is outfitted with stainless-steel appliances, glass backsplashes and granite counters.
All but one of the four bedrooms upstairs has California shutters, and each has access to one of three full bathrooms.
"In most subdivisions you get fairly large master ensuite," Mr. Zafiris adds. "This one was probably the size of a bedroom."
The basement is unfinished.

Full text: The wine flowed easily in this Cabbagetown suite ripe for new owners
31 WINCHESTER STREET,
UNIT 201 B
WHAT: A stunning two-storey, two-bedroom plus den contemporary condominium suite, completely refurbished. It features a light filled atrium and includes a private walled terrace facing south.
ASKING PRICE: $849,000
MAINTENANCE FEE: $664.16
TAXES: $3,455.94 (2008)
AGENT: Richard Silver, Bosley Real Estate Ltd.
Would it be rude to call this the house that Fat Bastard built?
Perhaps, but if you're a wine enthusiast, you would recognize the provocatively-named Australian wine that some say changed the way that wine was marketed. You might also recognize this home's owners - Peter Whitney and Marnie Griffith - who first brought Fat Bastard to Canada.
The couple say they saw the potential for this suite to serve as both their home and the base for their successful business the minute they laid eyes on it, back in 2001.
"From the outside, it was not prepossessing; you wouldn't necessarily know what to make of it, but once we stepped inside, we fell in love," Mr. Whitney says. "The suite reminded us of apartments in New York and Sydney, Australia. It was filled with light and was a wonderful space for entertaining and living. I could visualize the long bar in the kitchen as an excellent spot for wine tasting."
The home has layers of history. According to Peggy Kurtin, Chair of the Cabbagetown Heritage Conservation District Committee, the building is a hybrid Edwardian structure, notable for its yellow brick construction, erected in 1913 by builder J. & L. McKnight. Always a multi-family dwelling, records show that by 1938 there were 26 people living in the building.
With incarnations as a rooming house and then in the '70s an apartment building, in the '80's a stunning renovation took place. The suite at 201 B made a splash with its striking decor featuring pink walls, extensive use of mirrors, a hot tub on the deck and a black kitchen with a long bar/island begging to be used for parties. The festivities are the stuff of local legend, and it became know as the Pink Party Palace.
"We also have had many, many fantastic gatherings here," Mr. Whitney points out. "We would invite wine writers and restaurateurs and have the kitchen bar top filled with bottles of wine for tasting. We might entertain up on the deck, or step out to a restaurant for dinner to continue the discussion of wines. We, through our company, introduced the Fat Bastard wines to Canada from our home and office here. You could say Fat Bastard built this house."
"Or helped to pay for the renovations," Ms. Griffith laughs.
In the years that they have owned and occupied 201 B Winchester Street, Mr. Whitney and Ms. Griffith have completed extensive refurbishing, spending in the range of $100,000. The first four months of 2006 found Mr. Whitney and Ms. Griffith embarked on a cruise and trip to Australia, while Toronto interior designer Grace Price undertook a large part of the extensive renovation which included redoing the hardwood floors and gutting the two bathrooms, including the installation of an invitingly deep oval tub in the master ensuite. "I think the concept was that there could be a chair in the bath area and while one person soaks in the tub, the other could be seated and both could enjoy a glass of wine and chat in a candle-lit atmosphere," Ms. Price says.
Today, the unit is imbued with contemporary elegance and the walls are painted in a warm taupe called Straw Hat, unifying the decor, which while no longer pink is nonetheless stunning. The main floor of the suite is sun-filled thanks to a domed skylight the full length of the atrium/hall and floor-to-ceiling windows, many of which open onto Juliet balconies. A two-sided gas fireplace gives heat and ambiance to the living room and to the dining room, while the kitchen's black cabinetry has been outfitted with new hardware.
A floating staircase leads to the second floor with a den and a guest bedroom with ensuite bath and wood burning fireplace. Further down the hall there is a grand master bedroom suite, large enough for a respite from gaiety should one be desired. "We like the wood burning fireplace because there is really nothing like the smell of wood," Ms. Griffith notes. "The master bedroom opens onto the deck, but it can be closed off, in case someone wants privacy," Mr. Whitney points out.
The deck is protected by a sun shade and has stucco walls, giving what the owners call a very Santa Fe feeling.
The home is also at the hub of Cabbagetown activity. There's a deli and a corner store steps away, with the Winchester Hotel, now a restored landmark, nearby. "This is an eclectic, urban and unusual area and we love it," Ms. Griffith says. "We both have dual citizenship and we're going back to Australia now: the climate is more forgiving - they have sun 365 days of the year - but we will miss our home here."
***
THE AMENITIES
This luxury unit in a small condominium building has been entirely renovated and refurbished. It features a light-filled atrium floor, with painted tubular railings matching those on the floating staircase. There are three fireplaces: two gas burning, in the living room and the dining room and one wood burning in the guest bedroom. Ceiling heights on the main floor are over 12 feet and the atrium soars to a domed skylight running the full length of the area. The kitchen features stained black cabinetry with new hardware and countertops and a Blanco sink.
The second floor terrace is a spacious room-like space with stucco walls and sun shade, and is accessible both from the master bathroom and the hall. The master bedroom suite is spacious and singularly well appointed with custom built bedside cabinets and lighting reminiscent of those found in the luxury hotels frequented by the owners.
The home's space and ambience lends itself to contemporary living and extensive entertaining, with a long island bar in the sun-drenched kitchen and ample storage for food preparation and dining essentials.
There is parking for one car.
The common outdoor front courtyard has a mature ash tree, attractive plantings and well-kept hedges.

Abstract: An avid believer in "localism", a way of life that promotes practices like "The 100 Mile Diet", Mr. [Henry Wiersma] thinks of his house as "A 100 Mile House."

Full text: Over the next few months - likely into spring 2009 if all goes as planned - I'll be writing periodic instalments covering the building of a compressed earth block house in the Northumberland Hills east of Toronto. The house is the brainchild of Henry Wiersma, a builder who, for 20 years, built custom homes using conventional materials and methods. All that changed about four years ago when Mr. Wiersma's approach to building took a dramatic shift.
He'd been introduced to several books, among them The Ancient Secret of The Flower of Life by Drunvalo Melchizedec, and Places of the Soul: Architecture and Environmental Design as a Healing Art by Christopher Day. The books espoused a concept centered around geometric shapes and their affect on life and prompted him to look at design differently.
The concept that caught Mr. Wiersma's attention concerns ancient geometric forms such as those used to build the pyramids. He says it's about "sacred geometry" and "how shape affects how we live in spaces."
With this earth block house, the concept is first glimpsed in the shape of the foundation, a footprint formed by a circle within a square. The points of the square aim north, south, east, and west and the entry door will face east, in accordance with Native North American custom.
The intent of the design is to create a space that is healthy and in harmony with the materials used to create it. "All materials release energy," Mr. Wiersma says. "Highly processed and dense synthetic materials like plastic and vinyl off-gas the chemicals used to make them. This can affect us physically and psychologically." On the other hand, softer organic materials like clay and straw, because they're natural, are thought to release harmonious energy.
An avid believer in "localism", a way of life that promotes practices like "The 100 Mile Diet", Mr. Wiersma thinks of his house as "A 100 Mile House." All materials being used to build it are local. The clay for the compressed earth blocks comes from the surrounding land - the same property on which Mr. Wiersma's century farm sits. The straw will come from neighbouring fields. The wood that will make up the second floor, roof, and porch is reclaimed from a nearby barn. Windows and doors will be made by local craftspeople in pine or fir.
The blocks Mr. Wiersma has made to build the house shouldn't be confused with traditional sun-baked adobe bricks which have manure and straw mixed into the clay. Instead, Mr. Wiersma used only clay in his blocks, mixed with a small amount (5 per cent) of cement. He used a compressed earth machine, feeding the raw materials into one end, with the finished blocks - measuring about 10-by-4-by-4 - emerging at the other end.
The blocks have all been made, the straw bales have been acquired, and a dome has been constructed over the site to keep the emerging structure and workers dry. The next step is to lay the blocks. In the spring, the 18-inch-thick straw bales will be added to the exterior of the building which will then be clad with a natural earth plaster. The result will be finished walls that are 28 inches thick, forming a natural insulation against both heat and cold. A wrap-around wooden porch will finish the project. The plan is to then make a barn of the same construction.
In the coming winter months, Mr. Wiersma will concentrate on the interior which will offer a kitchen, bathroom, and sitting room and stairs leading to an open loft with sleeping and studio space. The home will be heated with a radiant in-floor heating system where hot water is pumped through plastic tubing laid under the floor. The power to heat and pump the water will be a combination of solar, wood, and waste heat from an on-site generator.
When the structure is finished, Mr. Wiersma plans to rent it and I'm sure he'll have plenty of guests. People will no doubt be drawn to the structure's construction and tranquil location overlooking rolling hills with Lake Ontario glistening in the distance.

Full text:   THE ECONOMY: World leaders struggle to agree on solutions as markets plunge sharply
Global leaders faced stark divisions over how to tackle the spiralling financial crisis yesterday as their governments tried to come to grips with another worldwide stock market plunge and a series of body blows to currencies from Australia to Iceland.
Sharp stock market declines around the world, a swoon in oil and other commodity prices, panic in Brazil and Russia and more bank troubles in Europe prompted calls for greater government and central bank intervention - but few signs of a global response.
In Europe, governments rushed to match guarantees on bank deposits and prevent a cross-border run on the continent's financial institutions.
German Chancellor Angela Merkel called on Europeans to craft a more unified response after a chaotic weekend summit with her French, Italian and British counterparts, who disagreed on key elements of a joint plan.
"The Europeans must show coherent action because, of course, we belong to a common currency zone," the Chancellor said.
South Korean officials, meanwhile, called for an emergency meeting with Japan and China.
And in the United States, the U.S. Federal Reserve Board opened up its credit spigot, authorizing $900-billion in loans to troubled banks, many of which have virtually stopped lending to consumers, businesses and each other.
In the face of unco-ordinated government action, World Bank President Robert Zoellick urged the creation of a new, larger Group of Seven that would include China, Russia, Saudi Arabia and others to solve the world's economic problems.
"The G-7 is not working," Mr. Zoellick, a former top Bush administration official, said in an uncharacteristically blunt speech in Washington. "We need a better group for a different time."
G7 finance ministers, including Canada's Jim Flaherty, are scheduled to meet this Friday in Washington to address the crisis that now extends well beyond the U.S. real estate and financial markets.
Already, optimism is fading that a $700-billion rescue of U.S. banks is enough put a stop to the credit crisis and avoid a global recession.
"Confidence is such a critical element right now, that if they [policy makers] come up a little short, it really, truly could be catastrophic," said Peter Gibson, a strategist at Desjardins Securities.
Widespread panic and fear of global recession gripped financial markets yet again yesterday, wiping out $2.2-trillion (U.S.) of value.
After twice falling more than 1,000 points as oil slumped, the Standard & Poor's/TSX Index rallied at the end of yesterday's trading to finish 572.92 points weaker at 10,230.43, the lowest close since October, 2005.
The index has now shed 2,000 points in just the past six trading days, and its total decline since peaking in June stands at 32 per cent.
In the United States, the Dow Jones industrial average finished below 10,000 for the first time since 2004, while British stocks had their worst percentage loss since the crash of 1987. The carnage spread to emerging markets because of their reliance on commodities, with regulators twice halting chaotic trading in Brazil.
So far, responses have been ad hoc as national governments try to put out local fires, but signs of co-operation are growing.
The Fed announced it will begin paying interest on commercial banks' reserves and pledged to take "additional measures as necessary." The Bank of Canada injected $2.4-billion (Canadian) into overnight money markets - the largest such injection by the Canadian central bank in the past year.
Those seeds of a global response by governments sparked some optimism.
"The benevolent fist of government will now join hands with Adam Smith in a most visible manner," said investor Bill Gross, who manages the world's largest bond fund. "Because it will, expect a lengthy recession but not depression."
The issue now is what policy makers, even working in unison, can do to salvage the world economy. The U.S. government's plan to purchase troubled assets can only be the first step, said Mr. Gibson.
Next, the United States must find a way to deal with the housing market's decline to stop a slowdown in consumer spending from becoming a full-blown crisis of its own. Then central banks can begin to try to restart the heartbeat of global commerce with a shock-treatment of co-ordinated interest rate cuts.
Yesterday, as markets sounded new depths, there were calls for emergency interest-rate reductions. Investors now expect a half a percentage-point cut when the Fed's interest rate-setting committee meets later this month, if not before. A reduction in the Fed's key rate would cause a corresponding drop in what commercial banks charge on loans to millions of consumers and businesses.
However, some analysts cautioned that a cut now could fan the panic.
"It sends the signal that things are worse than they anticipated or that they know something the market doesn't, and it sometimes can add fuel to the fire," said Dustin Reid, senior foreign exchange strategist at RBS Greenwich Capital Markets.

Full text:   Kiran Mhatre, 33, ekes out a living growing rice, fishing in the village pond, rearing livestock and cultivating miswak, a shrub whose twigs are used to maintain dental hygiene.
His family has lived off a three-acre patch of land for generations. And so when Reliance Industries Ltd., a powerful business conglomerate, offered him $25,000 for his land - an astronomical sum for a peasant who typically earns $600 a year - he declined.
"The money they're offering will dry up some time or the other," Mr. Mhatre said. "But our lands will feed our families throughout our lives."
Along the coastal belt of the western Indian state of Maharashtra, where fertile farms and salt flats are encircled by low-lying marshes, Reliance aims to build India's largest Special Economic Zone (SEZ) - a Chinese-style tax-free industrial enclave to promote trade and exports - comprising over 25,000 acres of land that would displace thousands of farmers across 22 villages in Raigad district.
As the economy surges, India is whetting a large appetite for industrialization. The Indian government has approved the creation of 250 SEZs across the country. But it faces a major hurdle: land procurement in a huge country where agriculture is still the mainstay.
With cities congested, the only free land available is fertile farmland in rural India. In a country where nearly two-thirds of the population - some 600 million people - live on farms, according to the National Sample Survey Organization in New Delhi, the government faces a major dilemma in how to divert this land to industries.
It's not just Reliance Industries, but a slew of other companies that are in a similar quandary. Dogged by violent protests from farmers who lost their lands, Tata Motors Ltd., an Indian car manufacturing giant, said last week it was going to abandon its small car manufacturing plant in Singur, in the eastern state of West Bengal. This plant was being built over a sprawling 997 acres of farmland from where Tata planned to roll out the Nano, billed as the world's cheapest car, during Diwali, the Indian festival of lights. Tata now plans to build this pint-sized car, expected to cost about $2,500, in rural Sanand in the western state of Gujarat.
Likewise, steel giant Lakshmi Mittal's ArcelorMittal is keen to set up steel units on 7,000 acres of land in the iron-rich tribal areas in the states of Jharkhand and Orissa, but faces an inordinate delay in land acquisition owing to stiff confrontation from local farmers.
Betel leaf farmers have held up a $12-billion project of the South Korean steel giant Posco in Orissa, occasionally kidnapping their officials.
In many instances, the transfer of land between farmers and corporations has occurred without conflict, but a large number of projects continue to remain stalled. According to the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, of industrial projects worth 70 trillion rupees ($1.5-trillion) planned in India, projects worth 2.5 trillion rupees ($54-billion) are stalled because of resistance in acquiring land.
"A fear psychosis is being created to slow down certain projects of national importance," said Mukesh Ambani, the chairman of Reliance Industries. "This will be counterproductive for the country's economic growth, its global image as well as India's ability to attract investments from across the world."
Industrialization, some economists argue, is the engine of India's economic resurgence, and shouldn't be stalled. Industrial enclaves like SEZs are expected to create millions of badly needed jobs for India's teeming millions and brings billions of dollars in foreign investment.
"I am reasonably sure that agriculture cannot offer productive employment opportunities to India's growing labour force," says Prof. Suresh Tendulkar of the Delhi School of Economics. "Consequently, transition to non-agricultural activities is inevitable."
India's farm sector grew by just 2.3 per cent over the past three years and grain production remains stagnant. Low crop yields, high interest rates charged by unscrupulous lenders and competition from farmers employing more advanced methods have caused thousands of peasants to commit suicide in recent years in India's south and west.
Feeling the need for some change, a government panel suggested amending India's archaic Land Acquisition Act to settle issues of land acquisitions from farmers. It recommends that 70 per cent of land for SEZs be bought by companies at market rates, a move aimed at ensuring farmers are well compensated when their land is taken for industrial growth.
However, in Mr. Mhatre's dusty village in Raigad district, called Malegharwadi, dirt roads remain pitted with bone-jarring potholes, water shortages are common, the power supply is erratic, and the nearest hospital is 80 kilometres away. But farmers are turning down Reliance's plump sums for their lands, impassive to the argument that the industrial project might bring jobs and economic prosperity to their doorstep.
"Some officials come and rattle off promises in English of providing cash and jobs for my family," Mr. Mhatre said, referring to Reliance company officials trying to cajole farmers to sell them their lands. "But you must understand that my land is my livelihood. It's not just a piece of real estate."

Finally, an issue: Who's going to bring the blue-collar jobs back

Abstract: NDP candidate Oscar (Oz) Cole-Arnal, a Lutheran minister with a dash of fire-and-brimstone to his delivery, says Canadian job losses - "55,200 lost in July alone" - have been particularly "devastating" to the blue-collar Canadians he hopes to represent.

Full text:   Hey, Stupid - it's not the environment, though there is a connection.
It's not leadership, though there should be a connection.
It's the economy, Stupid, just as you were told back in 1992 during that nasty Bill Clinton-George H.W. Bush campaign for the U.S. presidency.
Maybe you remember that far back: stock market throwing up on itself, real estate rotting, jobs shaky ...
This Canadian election has, so far, been the most penny (pun intended) dreadful campaign in memory, but there have been signs this week that, finally, one single issue is emerging.
Finally.
You heard hints of it in the two leaders' debates, but it was far more in evidence recently out on King Street, where volunteers from the Ontario Coalition for Social Justice were handing pamphlets out to anyone attending the all-candidates meeting going on in the Canada room of the local daily newspaper.
"Feeling insecure?" the pamphlets asked those who live and will vote in the manufacturing heart of Southwestern Ontario.
"Does Harper really care?"
You could find it upstairs in the Canada room, where the charmer of the evening's event turned out to be - steady now! - running for the Communist Party of Canada, a tiny political movement that wants to nationalize the oil and gas industry, wants a 32-hour work week with no pay cuts - and two years notice required by any business seeking to lay off workers.
When all six candidates - Liberal incumbent, Conservative, NDP, Green, Independent and the Communist - were asked by a member of the audience how voters could have faith that the various promises would be kept, Martin Suter grinned like a Cheshire cat, took a few chews of his gum, and gave an answer that brought down the house:
"Vote for me - and find out."
In some ways, that is what this election is coming down to. Vote - and find out. No wonder there is such nervousness in those parts of Ontario and Quebec where the job losses, so many of them in the auto sector, are mounting by the week. The nearby Toyota plant has decided not to go to a second shift. "Volvo to cut 500 jobs" in nearby Goderich reads a headline on the free copies of the Record being handed out to the 100 or more who have come to this all-candidates' meeting for the riding of Kitchener Centre.
It is October now, the time of Oktoberfest, but the beer has gone rather flat from the optimism and affluence of the past decade and more in this region of so much German heritage.
"There is no doubt," says Liberal Karen Redman, who has held this urban riding for the Liberals since 1997, "there is real pain in this community."
NDP candidate Oscar (Oz) Cole-Arnal, a Lutheran minister with a dash of fire-and-brimstone to his delivery, says Canadian job losses - "55,200 lost in July alone" - have been particularly "devastating" to the blue-collar Canadians he hopes to represent.
Tory candidate Stephen Woodworth, a mild-mannered lawyer, isn't even the incumbent, yet he gets all the heckling. He is blamed for failing to act on native land claims, for failing in Afghanistan, for doing nothing about the economy.
As the evening goes on, the election itself seems to evolve into that one outstanding issue. Cheryl Yan, a 27-year-old recent graduate of nearby University of Guelph, asks the final question of the night. What are they going to do about the economy?
Woodworth, speaking for Stephen Harper's Conservatives, acts as if everything that needs to be done is being done, that the economy is in good hands and requires little touch.
Redman, on the other hand, says, "There is a role for government" in hard times - a point echoed by all other candidates, including the grinning Communist candidate, who says that role should include a guaranteed annual income.
Clearly flustered at one point, the Conservative candidate says it only stands to reason that the economy would be at the top of people's minds now - "As Don Cherry might have said, 'It's not rocket surgery, is it?' "
Yan listens politely to all the answers but is hardly assured. She may have a freshly minted master's degree in hand, but that is not all that describes her.
"I'm unemployed," she says.
A couple of weeks back in Toronto, former Liberal minister Ken Dryden gave a speech in which he brilliantly tagged this irritating election as Stephen Harper's " Seinfeld campaign."
Up until this week, it had indeed been about nothing.
The only difference between it and Seinfeld was the Canadian general election of 2008 lacked a laugh track.
"This campaign is not about Mr. Harper," a frustrated Dryden said. "It is not about him ... This is a campaign about BIG, IMPORTANT things."
It is now. It is a campaign caught in a whirlwind of financial confusion.
Where every single candidate could say, as Martin Suter so succinctly put it:
"Vote for me - and find out."

Full text:   On paper, your company should be crowned employer of the year. It offers loads of personal days, on-site daycare, an on-site gym, a rolling drinks cart every Friday afternoon and there's a steady stream of expert speakers traipsing in during the lunch hour to help employees balance their overscheduled lives.
But, besides the personal days, you don't get to enjoy any of these perks. You don't work at head office, but one of the satellite branches or from home. And although you know your boss is swilling and chilling come Friday, it's a cup of old coffee for you.
"Far-flung employees feeling like second-class citizens? We have to make them feel like first-class passengers," says Roy Saunderson, president of the Recognition Management Institute in Kingsville, Ont., which has its head office in Montreal. Mr. Saunderson is a teleworker himself. "They're often saving the company money in real estate costs, so we can actually invest a little more in those employees who are offsite."
Don't get no respect
Maybe it's a simple matter of out of sight (and off site), out of mind.
"How many times have you had a virtual meeting and nobody's sent you the agenda? But guess what? Head-office folks have all got it because they're in the room," Mr. Saunderson says.
These little hiccups, leading to a general feeling of being disconnected, is exactly why Aimee Israel, chief executive officer of Toronto-based LifeSpeak Inc. - an organization that sends experts to companies to offer lifestyle seminars - recently started offering an online service. Employees who work for companies that have signed on can view 10-minute taped segments on their computers at work or at home about anything from what to do when their child has a fever to how to alleviate stress.
Before the online sessions launched, clients were asking to tape the speakers.
"But a taped session isn't really ideal viewing. It's often poor quality and they're an hour and a half. Who's going to sit through that?" Ms. Israel says.
One of her clients, Rajesh Uttamchandani, senior vice-president of human resources at CIBC Mellon in Toronto, agrees. Teleconferences and video conferences didn't succeed either.
"They were very expensive and they didn't seem to work as well. The employees still didn't feel like they were part of it," Mr. Uttamchandani says.
The virtual way
While high-quality taped sessions might be a start, Polly Pearson, vice-president of employment brand and strategy engagement for EMC Corporation in Hopkinton, Mass., says online virtual tools can make a real difference in helping employees connect, no matter where they are.
Last year the company launched an internal social networking site for all 40,500 workers around the world.
"It's all about knowledge and contribution, not about hierarchy or location," she says.
But Elaine Kunda, president and CEO of online local directory ZipLocal Inc. in Toronto, isn't convinced high-tech solutions can replace the good-old-fashioned face-to-face meeting or hanging around the lunch room with co-workers.
"It's the responsibility of the company to do whatever they can with the means they have," she maintains, "But it will never be the same. I don't believe that at all."
ZipLocal's own Montreal employees sometimes complain about feeling out of the loop, she says, even though she tries to send someone from head office there every three weeks, includes the employees in the company's newsletter and is setting up an employee blog. Still, in an era of multiple offices, turning to technology is the best any company can hope for.
Recognition rules
There are lots of ways to help remote workers feel like they're part of the team, however, Mr. Saunderson says. Bosses - not the company's HR department - need to keep track of these employees' anniversaries and other milestones and send a message on that day. Outlook and the like, with their automatic reminders, are a godsend.
"It's easy to forget when someone is out of sight," he maintains. "But we have to put this into the hands of managers and give them the tools and training on how to build these long-distance relationships."
Connection and recognition are everything to employees who feel left out. Supervisors can also leave a positive message on an offsite employee's voicemail overnight so when they arrive at work the next morning it's there waiting for them.
"No, this isn't a customer or a colleague. This is my boss, thanking me. Imagine the uplift that would create," he says.
The upside
It goes both ways. Sometimes absence makes the heart grow fonder. When you're at home you can actually feel stronger about your employer. You're not pulled into all of the politics. You also become an ambassador for that organization when you're out there doing your own thing.
Richard Davis, management psychologist for consultants RHR International Inc., Toronto
The downside
As soon as people are in a satellite office or working from home, they're never going to feel completely aligned with head office. I think you can do as much as you can to make it comfortable and make people as accessible as possible, but it's never going to be the same. They miss out on the camaraderie in the office and understanding the day-to-day.
Elaine Kunda, president and CEO of ZipLocal Inc., Toronto
Keeping connected
Employees who work offsite or in a satellite office may not be right where the action is, but here are a few ways to keep them from feeling like second-class citizens:
If the company offers localized benefits such as on-site daycare or gym facilities, make sure other employees receive a similar and related benefit, such as money earmarked for childcare or a gym membership.Stay connected. Managers need to call in from time to time just to see how the employee is doing. Don't just send e-mails.
Host regional events so far-flung employees can attend.
Offsite and satellite employees need recognition, too - and they're more likely to think they don't get it. Include their wins in the company newsletter or send a handwritten thank-you card. These small touches make a difference.

Full text:   Businesses, consumers and even state governments left in the lurch
In the chaotic two weeks it took to get a monster bank rescue through the U.S. Congress, the credit crisis has spread like a virus, infecting people and companies far beyond its epicentre in U.S. housing.
Many Americans can't get car loans. Companies of all kinds are struggling to secure operating cash. Banks and brokerages are too afraid to lend to each other. And many state and local governments are facing financial ruin because they can't issue bonds to pay for roads, schools and other essential services.
California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, the former tough-guy actor, sounded like a frightened man as he begged U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson this week for a $7-billion (U.S.) emergency loan.
"Absent a clear resolution to this financial crisis, California and other states may be unable to obtain the necessary level of financing to maintain government operations and may be forced to turn to the federal treasury for short-term financing," the Governor wrote to Mr. Paulson. "California is so large that our short cash-flow needs exceed the entire budget of some states."
California is big, but it isn't alone. U.S. states are required by law to balance their budgets every year. So they typically borrow cash at the start of the year, paying off those loans when sales and property tax revenues come in later in the year. But with fear gripping lenders, that kind of arrangement isn't available at a reasonable cost, if at all.
The situation in the commercial paper market is particularly worrisome. Otherwise solvent companies risk going into default because they can't roll over their maturing debt.
Indeed, outstanding commercial paper fell by more than $97-billion in the week ended Oct. 1, the U.S. Federal Reserve said this week.
Commercial credit markets have begun to take on the atmosphere of a back-alley, loan-shark operation. On Thursday, nearly 100 corporate treasurers from across the United States joined in an emergency conference call to complain of problems renewing lines of credit, including exorbitant fees and interest rates, driven higher by fear as much as fundamentals.
"It is now clear that the U.S. financial system is in cardiac arrest," economist Nouriel Roubini of New York University warned ominously yesterday.
Some U.S. companies are now looking in unconventional places to avoid the less palatable alternatives in the dysfunctional credit market.
Without explanation, Xerox Corp. said yesterday it would tap into excess cash available in its Canadian subsidiary, Xerox Canada, to secure a $300-million (Canadian) loan.
U.S. authorities warned of economic Armageddon without a monster bank rescue. The danger now is that the worst-case scenario may happen anyway.
Compounding the problem, the world's largest economy is almost certainly in recession, and the rest of the planet may not be far behind.
The latest in a wave of grim economic news was a report yesterday that 159,000 jobs vanished in September - the most in five years.
"Beyond the attention-grabbing crisis in financial markets, the long-running crisis in the real economy continues," said Jared Bernstein, senior economist with the Economic Policy Institute in Washington.
U.S. factories are gearing down, consumers are pulling back and the housing market has yet to find a bottom. Consider that lenders in the three counties that make up South Florida have foreclosed on residential properties worth more than $14-billion (U.S.) so far this year, according to a new report by consultant Peter Zalewski of Condo Vultures, and that's just one of dozens of key U.S. real estate markets.
The theory, according to the bailout's boosters, is that if the Treasury can relieve financial institutions of toxic mortgage assets, like those in South Florida, banks will then have more capital to resume normal lending - to businesses, consumers and each other.
More importantly, the sheer size of the package is designed to re-establish confidence that the government is on top of the problem.
Not everyone is convinced.
Mark Loewenstein, an associate professor of finance at the University of Maryland, said the details of the proposed bank bailout remain as murky as its ultimate impact.
"I don't think anyone can say if this will work," Prof. Loewenstein said.
That's because the rescue is intended to be as much a psychological boost as a liquidity injection. The program's success will depend to a large extent on peoples' "expectations" of what's happening, Prof. Loewenstein said.
"By showing a lot of money up front, maybe people start participating in credit markets again," he explained. "But it's impossible to know whether all the other lending channels will unclog."
Billionaire investor Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. said the bailout provides "some tools" to deal with the country's economic woes, but he insisted the crisis isn't over.
"This is not a panacea," Mr. Buffett told CNBC after the vote. "This does not solve all our problems."
Mr. Buffett's behaviour, however, suggests the notoriously astute investor believes the bottom may not be far off. In recent weeks, Berkshire Hathaway has scooped up $8-billion worth of investment bank Goldman Sachs and industrial giant General Electric at fire-sale prices.
The program could help unleash a wave of capital that is poised to buy distressed subprime mortgage debt and other assets, bringing new liquidity to the system.
While the credit crunch has been sucking money out of the banking system, enormous pools of capital, including foreign pension funds, sovereign wealth funds, and private family institutions have been building up.
"These pools of capital are waiting on the sidelines and preparing to deploy," CIBC chief financial officer Gerald McCaughey said in an interview yesterday.
The U.S. bailout program could be one of the catalysts that tells them "it is time to get moving if they want to invest," he said.

Full text:   Toronto developers who weren't too busy this week searching for new bankers to finance their pre-sold but un-built housing projects passed time gossiping about which of them would fail first. The targets of anxiety varied, but the consensus was clear: No matter how orderly the eventual cleanup may or may not be, the party's over.
For some, the job is to replace financing promised by defunct Lehmann Brothers of New York, which until recently was active in the local condo market. Others are being forced to dig deeper into their own pockets to shore up the waning confidence of nervous bankers.
Pre-sales to willing buyers count for little in the new environment: Some industry veterans are now being asked to produce actual building permits before their banks will let them begin construction.
"These guys close their doors fast," said one. "It's common knowledge that even the most robust developers are having trouble getting financing. It's tough, tough, tough."
Whatever happens next week or next year, the late boom will be remembered as having transformed the central city, with tens of thousands of new apartments standing as evidence of dramatically renewed vitality. But outside the magic core, in older suburbs desperately seeking new investment, nothing will have changed.
In that respect, the most obvious victim of the credit crunch is the city itself, which has invested so much political capital in the promise of ever-increasing real-estate values. Sagging values clearly imperil such signature policies as waterfront renewal, the land-transfer tax, social-housing rehabilitation and even the vaunted Mayor's Tower Renewal program.
Barring a miracle, the new tower now rising at the corner of Dundas and Parliament will be the last evidence of the much-anticipated revitalization of Regent Park, Canada's largest public-housing project - and the city's most ambitious attempt to use condo sales to finance social policy.
There was a time it almost seemed possible. Senior governments had abandoned the housing business and land values were soaring. The solution was to sell off part of the site for market housing in order to rebuild public housing on the rest.
But even in the best of times, the city was unable to find a developer to take the risk. Undeterred, it self-financed construction of the first "market" building. With even the most prominent developers now struggling to finance construction on prime midtown sites, there seems little hope for Regent Park.
And Lawrence Heights, that other battered public-housing neighbourhood in a much more remote location, currently awash in talk of similar, bootstrap-style revitalization? Forget it. Without real money from government, nothing will happen.
Waterfront redevelopment is much less challenging in theory, but one look at the harbourfront shows what happens when policy-driven authorities attempt to surf against the waves, developing housing in a "negative equity" market. Their failure takes permanent shape on the skyline.
With its ambitious plans for the East Bayfront on the other side of Yonge Street, Waterfront Toronto has set the same trap for itself, promising all kinds of goodies that the real estate is supposed to pay for. It was a good plan yesterday.
Although still inchoate, the Mayor's Tower Renewal could emerge as the ultimate victim of the crunch.
Most of the magic money needed to finance this revitalization scheme is expected to come from energy savings. Presuming the same economics applies tomorrow, many old high-rises will get new winter coats over the next few years. But the big moves intended to revive distressed neighbourhoods as a whole depend on real-estate leverage that no longer exists.
While it lasted, the real-estate boom presented an interesting alternative to government-financed social policy. Significant revitalization occurred, but only in locations dictated by the market.
The rest of the city waited patiently for a turn, it now seems clear, that will never come.

Full text:   With its traditional economic bases eroding, B.C. looks to Microsoft's new centre in Richmond as beachhead for the industry
Forty national flags hang in a row on a wall inside
Microsoft Corp.'s development centre just south of Vancouver. They represent the diversity of the 325 software testers and developers working at the new facility.
They may also be a sign of a hoped-for jump-start for the tech sector in the region, as the traditional underpinnings of the area's economy erode.
Ciprian Chisalita is a recent arrival. The 25-year-old Romanian computer scientist moved to Vancouver July 5 and started at the Microsoft development centre two days later, working on search technology.
"It's a great place, you're handed a lot of new technology, you're plugged in," he said.
Vancouver is a place where he wants to stay and build his career and life. He finds familiarity in the mountains north of the city, which are like the ones around his hometown of Brasov in central Romania.
"I would prefer to stay here. Here, I have everything," Mr. Chisalita said.
The region's leaders are hoping Mr. Chisalita is the beginning of a wave of many new arrivals working in the technology sector to Vancouver and the surrounding cities of Burnaby, Richmond and Surrey. Until now, technology here has thrived in niches such as digital media and fuel cells but has generally lagged other Canadian provinces and especially neighbours in the United States such as California, Oregon and Washington state.
They are hoping the Microsoft Canada Development Centre will act as a magnet for other tech companies, creating a mini-Silicon Valley North.
Though Microsoft already has development centres, as well as research and development offices, in countries including Israel, Ireland, India and China, the company chose the Vancouver region for another one partly because of a more welcoming immigration climate. There is a low cap on what are called H-1B visas in the United States, which are three-year passes for skilled workers with university degrees, limiting the number of people Microsoft and other tech firms can bring in from around the world.
Locating in Richmond, Microsoft can much more easily bring in the likes of Mr. Chisalita. In the year since opening in September, 2007, the company has grown to 325 people from 20 - the vast majority coming from outside Canada - with plans to keep adding people quickly, eyeing a total contingent of more than 700. Last month alone, 25 new employees started work, another influx of highly skilled and well-paid people.
Other important factors in Microsoft's choosing Richmond include the city's proximity to the company's headquarters in the Seattle suburb of Redmond, as well as the Vancouver region's diversity, which meshes well with the firm's work force, according to Parminder Singh, managing director of the development centre.
And it's not only the region that has high hopes for the centre.
Microsoft wants to become a platform from which a stronger regional technology industry grows.
"If I look at an analogy of a mall, I want us to be an anchor tenant," Mr. Singh said. "By being significant, and having financial strength, and the ability to attract some of the top talent in the world, that in itself is going to create an ecosystem right here for the greater Vancouver area, that is going to be felt."
The arrival of one of the world's best-known technology names occurs as the regional economy hits a slump. After real gross domestic product growth of 3.6 per cent in 2006 and 4 per cent in 2007 - driven by real estate and construction - growth is projected to be halved to 2.1 per cent this year and 1.9 per cent in 2009, according to a forecast published this week by Central 1 Credit Union.
The traditional underpinning of the economy - forestry - remains in a dire situation, which is expected to get worse with the deepening housing implosion and credit crisis in the United States. Ascendant industries - natural gas and metallurgical coal - are picking up the slack but not enough to propel the whole economy forward.
And while Vancouver's standard of living is high, this hasn't translated economically, beyond construction and real estate. The city is famous for its beauty, surrounded by oceans and forests and mountains, where in some months it is possible to ski in the morning, golf in the afternoon and go sailing in the evening. It is routinely ranked in surveys as one of the best cities to live in the world.
Many people want to live here but what to do for work is sometimes a mystery. The region is defined by many small- and medium-sized businesses, rather than easy-to-identify large sectors and companies, such as oil and natural gas in Calgary or banks in Toronto.
Technology, a sector where workers seem particularly suited to the temperate West Coast lifestyle, hasn't made much of a mark compared with other jurisdictions.
The B.C. tech sector accounted for just 5 per cent of the province's GDP, according to the latest information compiled by B.C. Stats, a government agency. That's less than the Canadian average of about 6 per cent and around 8 per cent in Quebec, and lower than most U.S. states, including neighbours Washington, at 11 per cent, and Oregon at 12 per cent. Those states, as well as Quebec, benefit from high-tech manufacturing, where B.C. notably lags, and are also strong in areas such as software development.
Among the more worrisome numbers for B.C. is the measure of patents granted per 100,000 people, where B.C. is notably trailing competitors Alberta, Ontario and Quebec.
The good news for B.C. is percolating promise. Notwithstanding the patent deficit in the province, the University of British Columbia is a heavyweight among Canadian institutions, collecting more than 100 patents so far this decade, B.C. Stats said, behind only McGill University in Montreal.
And high-tech in B.C. is growing rapidly from its relatively small base, with revenues up 10 per cent in 2006, B.C. Stats said, double the
national increase of 5 per cent.
"What Vancouver is missing right now is there's just a lack of anchor tenants in the tech sphere," said Mr. Singh. "Let's take a contrast of Seattle. Seattle has Microsoft. If we look at Vancouver, we have [video-game maker] Electronic Arts - but I don't see too many EAs. If we step back and say, 'What's Vancouver known for?' Well, it's a gateway to the world, it's a great place to live, great outdoors and all this other stuff, which shouldn't be minimized, but it's not known for technology. It's not a Silicon Valley."
Despite this, Microsoft decided in the spring of 2007 to open a Canadian development centre. It turned its attention to the Vancouver region, weighing Burnaby and Richmond and decided on Richmond, in large part because of the availability of adequate real estate. The centre is in a business park developed in the 1990s and already home to tech names such as MacDonald Dettwiler and Associates Ltd., though Microsoft didn't choose the spot because of its tech-oriented neighbours.
Like other business parks, the area is antiseptic and hardly hints at any sort of community. There are no cafes, there is only the occasional
bicyclist and no one walks.
If Microsoft is to be a hub, it will be a general one for the technology sector in the
greater region, rather than the heart of a bustling local neighbourhood.
But the region has some work to do to attract the hoped for tech expansion.
One challenge for Vancouver is the cost of housing, the most expensive in the country. The cost to develop software and multimedia Internet programs is about the same in Vancouver as it is in Portland, Ore., and cheaper than in Seattle, according to an annual
assessment by consultancy KPMG. But housing in the Vancouver region is an issue, especially for the young people many tech companies hope to attract.
"The quality of life in the region is one major element that draws people but affordable housing is one of the big drawbacks - and affordable rentals. We're below 1-per-cent vacancy; it's scary," said Bernie Magnan, chief economist at the Vancouver Board of Trade.
The region also has to do a better job of selling itself, Mr. Magnan said, a sentiment shared by many others, including Richmond Mayor Malcolm Brodie, who said the arrival of Microsoft will help.
"A company like that creates a lot of attention," Mr. Brodie said. "You will find that other companies that are looking to come in to your region give more serious consideration when a company like Microsoft has given serious consideration and located in Richmond. It doesn't mean you'll automatically get the next one but it means that they may take a look at it more seriously."
Greater regional co-operation is needed to market the Lower Mainland to firms looking to establish themselves or grow, Mr. Brodie said, explaining local officials could "do far more."
"The answer to the question 'How much do we do as a region?' is 'Not nearly enough.' In the coming years, I think you'll see us do more. But there's been a start made."
This start is called Metro Vancouver Commerce, a loosely united group of cities in the region that started work this year to market the area to businesses under the slogan "Powerhouse. Paradise."
One of the first projects was a two-day visit to Beijing.
"None of the municipalities could have gone over there and done that on their own," said Phil Heard, chief executive officer of Vancouver
Economic Development Commission.
Working together requires a shift in thinking to co-operation from competition, Mr. Heard said.
"Microsoft going to Richmond isn't a loss for Vancouver, it's a win for the region," he said. "Like with anything, we all had to lean to co-operate and share, but it's becoming easier."

DIGITAL MEDIA TO COME
On the boldly named Great Northern Way, just southeast of downtown Vancouver nestled in an light industrial area, four postsecondary institutions are dreaming of a real estate play that will underpin a digital media hub
populated by students, businesses and artists.
The project began in 2002, when Finning International Inc. donated 7½ hectares of land
abutting the rail yards on Industrial Avenue to four schools: the
University of British Columbia, Simon Fraser University, Emily Carr Institute of Art + Design and the British Columbia Institute of
Technology.
Today, 50 students are working on their master's degrees in
digital media, with the first
graduating class set for spring.
Ten years from now, if all goes well, the project's backers hope to have at least 500,000 feet of residential space among a total potential of 3-million square feet, which would include about 400,000 square feet of academic space for about 1,000 students.
The area would also add much-needed commercial space in the heart of Vancouver.
Lack of space - and high prices for the small amounts available - has been a deterrent for expanding businesses.
"We've looking at shovels in the ground in three to four years," said Brad Foster, a spokesman at Great Northern Way Campus Ltd.
Vancouver is a major global centre for digital media, a sector best known for video games and one that includes many specific fields such as digital animation and special effects for film.
The city's available talent, and the mix of skills from computer engineering to art and design,
recently drew Seattle's successful Big Fish Games Inc. to Vancouver to open its first office outside its home city, finding 4,500 square feet in Vancouver's fashionable downtown neighbourhood of
Yaletown.
Big Fish, which employs 310 workers in Seattle and plans to add 30 in Vancouver by the end of next year, spent three years weighing options around the world on where to open its first satellite office.
"We're focused on getting the right people, rather than a lot of people," said Jeremy Lewis, a long-time Goldman Sachs managing director who is chief executive officer of Big Fish, which in September raised $83-million (U.S.) in its first round of financing with institutional investors.

Full text:   Linea
LOCATION: Bayview Village
BUILDER/DEVELOPER: Symmetry Developments
SIZE: 2,730 to 2,935 square feet
PRICE: mid-$900,000s to $1.1-million
CONTACT: To register, phone (416) 482-0082 or visit

Symmetry Developments has unveiled a collection of contemporary-styled townhouses designed by award-winning Teeple Architects for an infill site at Bayview and Sheppard Avenues.
This will be the first townhouse development by Teeple - the only Canadian firm to win two Governor-General's architecture awards in 2008 - and is set on a plot of land on an angled street.
The units jut slightly outward from one another, with limestone facades and floor-to-ceiling windows giving residents views of Bayview Village Park across the street.
The sales office will open later this month for the project, called Linea, which will comprise 11 freehold townhouses at 2985 Bayview Ave., just north of Sheppard Avenue at Hillcrest Avenue.
"We're going with more luxurious materials, while keeping a very modern look," says Symmetry creative director Sayf Hassan. "We are emphasizing the height of these units and a certain grandeur without being very ornate or architecturally conservative."
The developer expects the project will appeal to locals - from young professionals to empty-nesters downsizing from larger residences - looking to stay close to the Sheppard subway line and Bayview Village Shopping Centre.
Units, all of which will have a private elevator, will generally have three bedrooms on the upper floors, four bathrooms, a second-floor study and a finished basement.
In each unit, an extra-tall custom mahogany entrance door will open into a living room with 12½ -foot ceiling and a central staircase. Kitchen and dining areas will connect, with a walkout to a private terrace fitted with water and gas connections.
The master suite will be on the second floor, while the third floor will have another bedroom and a private outdoor space. On the lower level, the family room will have direct access to the two-car garage and storage area.
Standard finishes will include a European-style kitchen with built-in pantry, granite or quartz countertops and stainless steel appliances.
The master bathroom will have a glass-enclosed shower stall, rectangular vessel sink and deep soaker tub.
Flooring will be a combination of engineered hardwood, porcelain, marble, ceramic or slate tile, and 40-ounce broadloom. The developer will also incorporate environmentally friendly materials and several energy-efficient features, including Energy Star laundry machines and high-efficiency furnaces.
The monthly maintenance fees will be set at $98. Occupancy is scheduled for the end of 2009.

Full text:   Serial home sellers get their latest home ready for its close-up
Our real estate agent calls us "real estate junkies." I've been called worse.
The reason for the moniker is, yep, our house is on the market.
After 2½ years and non-stop renovations to make it our own, we've decided to try to downsize.
I say "try to" because the pool of potential buyers for a house this big - 6,243 square feet - is smaller than it is for more normal-size houses.
No one may want it and there's a wee part in both our hearts that secretly hopes no one does.
Listing the house has, of course, resulted in even more renovations to get the place ready for its open house close-up tomorrow. Anyone who reads this column even occasionally will know what a fusspot I am about such things.
No effort is being spared in the "staging" process. We figure, if we don't manage to sell this fall, we'll be able to enjoy the fruits of our labour ourselves.
Either way, I'm practising what I preach when it comes to home staging: neutralize, de-clutter, clean like there's no tomorrow, and put your money into the big-ticket items that will bring you the most return on investment.
A two-day marathon
Here's what that formula translated into with this house:
In a two-day marathon, the in-your-face yellow living room has been repainted a more soothing neutral tone with crisp white trim.
The ceiling which used to look muddy with all that yellow reflecting off it is now refreshed and white again.
To save time, we used Benjamin Moore's new Aura paint, marketed as a one-coat formulation that glides on like butter cream and really does cover in one go.
The result is a space that serves as a cool contrast to the warm hues of the adjacent family room which, by the way, also wasn't immune to paint touch ups on walls and trim.
The dated hunter-green plush carpeting that remained in two upstairs bedrooms was replaced with new off-white Berber broadloom.
I'm now hoping to find time to finally hang the lovely wall covering I imported from Britain this spring for the larger of those guestrooms.
Some readers may recall that refinishing the walls, trim, and ceiling in that guestroom, whose ensuite bathroom transformation I wrote about earlier this year, was part three of a spring-time renovation blitz. Maybe now we'll finally finish it.
Exterior staging
The more major of our home staging renovations includes replacing all of the exterior decorative wood timbers.
The house was designed as a faux-Tudor but the exterior timbers have seen better days so we're having them replaced with new, pine timbers stained a cool chocolate-brown on all four sides.
To prevent the new wood from warping like the existing timbers have done, we'll have them glued and screwed in place. That work starts Nov. 1 and will take about two weeks to complete.
Exterior work of this nature joins kitchens and bathrooms as big ticket items that should always be addressed when selling because they guarantee you'll recoup your investment.
We're lucky in this regard. Both kitchens in the house - the second is in the two bedroom apartment/granny flat we created - are new, custom, and need no additional work.
And, we've been steadily renovating the bathrooms since we moved in with only the seventh, the one in the basement, left to address.
There, we replaced a cracked pedestal sink with a new marble-topped vanity and sink, installed new lighting, and painted the walls and trim.
The rest of our efforts have been concentrated on de-cluttering and cleaning. I always advise clients that when selling, rooms must sparkle from top to bottom and extra "stuff" must be eliminated.
Stick to the mantra
De-cluttering allows potential buyers to easily walk around and through spaces, to really see the "bones" of the house.
In our case, two truckloads of that extraneous stuff, things collected over the years that I finally refuse to move one more time, were sent to the local recycling centre.
My mantra, as I ruthlessly emptied out our storage spaces, was, if I hadn't touched it in a year - out it went.
Baseboards have been scrubbed, tile scoured, closets tidied, and all the windows I could reach, inside and out, while perched precariously on ladders straddling cedar bushes, have been scrubbed clean.
Cleaning of the second floor windows will be contracted out to the same guys who fix our eavestroughs. I don't have a death wish.
Because we've done most of the work ourselves, our costs have been reasonable, all things considered.
We have spent around $350 on paint and paint supplies, $400 on wallpaper, and about $2,500 on new carpeting.
Replacing the exterior wood work will cost close to $10,000 but it's necessary, will have an immediate visual impact, and will last for years to come.
It's all worth it, whether it's for someone else to enjoy or for ourselves.
I think of it as a labour of love.

Abstract: Toronto, like every other city, was once split up into dozens of telephone exchange districts (covered here in November 2006). Conjuring up these would immediately moor your building to its new surroundings. Don't "The Grover," "The Redfern," "The Lennox" and "The Hargrave" have a nice ring to them?

Full text:   No need to conjure up allusions to faraway places - there's plenty to drawn right at home
Dear condo developers and marketers:
About 15 years ago, when the current condo boom was but a small cap-gun 'pop,' I remember being livid at seeing a Toronto condo named after a well-known, formerly-gritty neighbourhood in Manhattan.
"Toronto has its own identity!" I wanted to scream, but back then I didn't have a neat little newspaper soapbox from which to vent my spleen, and had I done it on the street corner on a real soapbox, I would have been arrested.
Then things just got confusing, which angered me more. While the names you were choosing didn't make reference to New York City necessarily (although many did), they also had nothing to do with their neighbourhoods or even Toronto in the larger sense. Was it some sort of game you were all playing to exacerbate our inferiority complex?
Throughout the 1990s, every stupid condo name was another bee in my bonnet, and, by the early 2000s, I found myself looking up "beekeepers" in the Yellow Pages.
Well, I've mellowed since then. I understand the importance of branding, especially when dealing with a product that's not very different from the one just down the street behind the other guy's hoarding. In fact, I've always been fascinated by places like like Wildwood, N.J., a blue-collar beach town with hundreds of 1950s and '60s L-shaped motels that would be hard to tell apart were it not for their differing signage, paint schemes and pool configurations.
I also understand the desire to evoke the exotic using far-away place names, so views of supposititious swaying palms replace traffic tie-ups on the Gardiner Expressway. Heck, not only did they do that for those Wildwood motels a half-century ago, they did it right here on rental apartment buildings, since condos hadn't been invented yet. In fact, I wrote about these little bricks-and-mortar imposters - the Monterey, Cardiff, Casablanca, Algiers, Capri, even one named after the fabulous Fontainebleau Hotel in Miami - in this section in May, 2005.
Besides, in recent years you have been improving. Condos now are named after particular streets, street numbers, neighbourhoods or some significant attraction nearby, such as City Hall or the Distillery District. One of you even adopted the first three characters of your building's postal code, which I think is rather clever.
Those of you doing industrial-to-residential conversions almost always employ names and logos that echo your building's former life - whether a tannery or a toy factory - but since it doesn't take a PhD in marketing to understand there's instant romance in using such imagery, I'm not going to jump up and down about it.
Then again, the pessimist in me says it's the law of averages at play here - there are so many good names nowadays only because there are so many holes in the ground.
Dig deeper and there are just as many offenders: For instance, the other day I came across a condo named after an entire U.S. state and another named after a whole city. Thankfully, it wasn't NYC this time, but I think you can do better.
Please clip-n-save these handy tips for the next time you're stuck: I reiterate - Toronto is not New York or any other U.S. city.
A lot of twenty- and thirtysomethings will tell you that it's pretty freakin' cool despite this. The more you compare us to other places, the more you undermine our collective confidence, so please stop. We have our own history of artists' areas, so rather than referring to, say, Greenwich Village, try Gerrard Street Village, where Toronto's beatniks once roamed.
And speaking of history, Toronto has many almost-forgotten names of amalgamated towns (and districts) that would be nice to see again. If you can name a condo after a neighbourhood that's 800 kilometres away, why not one that's eight kilometres away, such as "The Swansea"?
That's an elegant, art deco-sounding name if there ever was one. And the former village, annexed by Toronto in 1967, was named after a faraway city in Wales, so there's some exotic bang-for-your-buck if you're still not convinced.
Toronto, like every other city, was once split up into dozens of telephone exchange districts (covered here in November 2006). Conjuring up these would immediately moor your building to its new surroundings. Don't "The Grover," "The Redfern," "The Lennox" and "The Hargrave" have a nice ring to them?
How about local landmarks that are gone?
Any Etobicoke lakeshore condo could name itself "The Cruise Condo" in tribute to the demolished art deco Cruise Motel and receive an instant cache of cool. Maybe you could recreate their amazing neon sign with the built-in clock.
If you'd like your condo to have a roguish edge, why not borrow a personage from our past?
How does "The Boyd Residence," after the infamous 1950s bank-robbing Boyd Gang, sound? Or, going further back, what about "The William Lyon"? Regal but too old, right? Okay, how 'bout "Baron Black Tower"?
I think you get the point. I've always said that we Canadians don't do enough to celebrate our own, and you're not helping with all of your non-specific condo names.
Not to mention I can't afford the beekeeper right now.
Sincerely, The Architourist

Full text:   It might be said that the path to widespread green development techniques of low-rise housing started in East Gwillimbury.
In 2005, after the passage of provincial greenbelt protection measures, the bucolic town in York Region probably had more horses than humans within its boundaries. Stretched across acreages northeast of Newmarket with plenty of greenfield to spare, the town was suddenly thrust into developers' sites for its ample supply of land.
But the next year, East Gwillimbury Mayor James Young and the town council threw down an environmental gauntlet to builders: If you want to build more than 10 detached houses, semis or townhouses in any one location, you have to make sure they meet the highest standards for energy efficiency.
"Energy-efficient housing is the best way to ensure that East Gwillimbury's residents are insulated against rising energy costs and won't have to make costly energy-efficiency upgrade retrofits in the future," Mr. Young said at the time, in announcing that the new developments would have to meet Energy Star requirements in terms of insulation, heating and ventilation and water heating and usage.
Not long after that, Minto Communities and Crystal Homes launched Harvest Hills, a mix of 635 detached houses along with semis and townhouses in a farm field on the outskirts of Newmarket.
Last week, Minto announced that not only did its 331-dwelling share of the subdivision meet Energy Star standards, but also that one of its model homes has been given a silver LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certification by the Canada Green Building Council.
There are four levels of LEED certification - Platinum, Gold, Silver and Certified - and it has become a common feature in new high-rise developments but is relatively harder to achieve on the low-rise stage. LEED is also different from Energy Star in that certification is based on a different set of criteria, such as proximity to public transit, use of local building materials, and water recycling capabilities.
Minto is driving hard to brand itself at the forefront of green residential development, and the LEED Silver, combined with the overall Energy Star requirements for Harvest Hills, is intended to set the stage for future environmentally friendly low-rise developments.
"This is our first Energy Star community," says Samantha Sampson, a marketing consultant to Minto Communities, about Harvest Hills. "This project has allowed us to work out the kinks involved in using these new techniques and materials."
One kink Minto has had to iron out is construction schedules. To obtain the green certifications, structures have to undergo various tests. One such test is the "door blower" procedure, in which a machine is brought on site to see if the doors and windows are installed properly to prevent cold air from leaking in. Construction needs to be co-ordinated so that several houses can be tested at the same time.
Until recently, the biggest knock against green upgrades of new low-rise housing is that it could add up to $10,000 to the cost of a detached house. But as energy costs rose dramatically, the long-term savings on utility bills was worth the extra money upfront.
Phase One of Minto's Harvest Hills' component was released last September, comprising 50 singles, semis and townhouses. Only four of the 37 freehold townhouses remain, priced from $279,900 to $287,900 for between 1,862 and 1,939 square feet.
Detached homes range from $373,900 for 2,294 square feet and four bedrooms, to $421,900 for 2,800 square feet and four bedrooms for the model that won the LEED Silver tag.

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/bernier-confident-canadians-will-trust-him-again/docview/382679310/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Most voters in Beauce gave little credence to Ms. [Julie Couillard]'s story, saying she was acting out of spite and vengeance against her former boyfriend. Expressions such as "liar," "opportunist" and "crazy" were among the kinder words voters were using in response to her allegations.

Full text:   Looking to make a political comeback, Maxime Bernier says he believes he will be exonerated by a victory in the Oct. 14 election and that Canadians will once again trust him as a cabinet minister should the Conservatives form the next government.
"They know Maxime Bernier. They just have to judge me. And I think the people here in my riding will judge me for what I did in the past, and on my record. And after that, Canadians will see me and they know Maxime Bernier to be the same guy," Mr. Bernier told reporters yesterday.
The former foreign affairs minister, who resigned after leaving classified NATO briefing documents at the home of his former girlfriend, Julie Couillard, expressed confidence that his re-election in the Quebec riding of Beauce will put his controversial past behind him.
Unless the Conservatives improve their standing in Quebec and elect credible candidates, it would be slim pickings when Conservative Leader Stephen Harper goes looking for cabinet representation for the province. Ministers Lawrence Cannon, Josee Verner and Christian Paradis are expected to win their ridings easily. But Michael Fortier and Jean-Pierre Blackburn may not, according to recent polls of their ridings.
The prospect of losing ministers from Quebec with few replacements could create a problem for Mr. Harper, so Mr. Bernier is attempting to repair the damage caused by his resignation in case a second chance comes along.
"I've turned the page," Mr. Bernier said, urging his constituents to give him an even stronger mandate than the last time. "I'm very proud of what I did in the past for them, and I am very proud as a member of this government."
During an all-candidates' debate on a local radio show yesterday, Mr. Bernier was applauded by the audience when he refused to comment on allegations Ms. Couillard made in her autobiography, in which she described her former lover as "superficial" and showing "surprising intellectual laziness."
In her book, My Story , Ms. Couillard writes that Mr. Bernier asked her one morning to throw secret documents in the trash, but to "wait for garbage day to do it, after all they are confidential documents." She also wrote that Mr. Bernier often heaped scorn on Mr. Harper, saying "he was fat, he had a belly, he wasn't in shape, he spent his time drinking Pepsi."
RCMP are investigating whether Ms. Couillard, who once had ties with biker gang members, lobbied two senior Conservative officials on a federal real-estate deal in Quebec City on behalf of a land-promoting firm, the Kevlar Group. Police are also investigating how she came into possession of secret government documents.
Most voters in Beauce gave little credence to Ms. Couillard's story, saying she was acting out of spite and vengeance against her former boyfriend. Expressions such as "liar," "opportunist" and "crazy" were among the kinder words voters were using in response to her allegations.
Mr. Bernier won by almost 26,000 votes in 2006 and expects to repeat that performance despite the controversy that shattered his political career last May. He is counting heavily on voter sympathy, portraying himself as a victim of a personal relationship that went sour while suggesting that the greater the victory the better his chances for political rehabilitation.
"I had a great summer and a great campaign. I can't wait for Oct. 14 and watch the people of the Beauce work together with me to build this region," he said during the debate, prompting applause from supporters in the room.

Full text:   One of six sons of legendary founder Moses Loeb, he studied agriculture and became a principal in M. Loeb Ltd. Later, he branched into real estate and successfully dabbled in venture capitalism
Jules Loeb was never one to take it easy. When the Toronto businessman wasn't channelling his restless energy into his diverse entrepreneurial activities, he built a first-rate collection of Canadian art, engaged in politics and philanthropy, and devoted himself to entertaining family and friends.
"He loved to keep busy. He couldn't sit still," recalled his daughter, Audrey Loeb. "He was always moving." She remembers that three weeks before it was discovered that Mr. Loeb needed a coronary bypass and replacement valve operation, her father had lugged 20 heavy tapestries up to the third floor of her house.
"He was a very active guy and in the last year of his life, he had severe emphysema and he couldn't do what he wanted to do," said Ms. Loeb, who is a Toronto lawyer. "Even then, he just kept going."
That same enthusiasm guided Mr. Loeb through his life as a principal in the national grocery chain his father built - M. Loeb Ltd. - and later, as he pursued business ventures of his own. His son-in-law Steve Irwin, a former corporate lawyer in New York, called Mr. Loeb "a man of divergent tastes and skills who liked to do a lot of different things."
To be sure, one year Mr. Loeb organized a lavish fireworks display to help ring in the new year. But the fireworks unexpectedly misfired and shot off horizontally instead of vertically, sending the guests scrambling for their lives.
This firecracker of a man grew up in Ottawa where he was one of six brothers, all of whom would work at one time or another for M. Loeb Ltd. His father, Moses Loeb, had left Russia around the turn of the century to avoid being drafted into the Czar's army. He first settled in Cincinnati, but reportedly grew nostalgic for the harsh winters of his homeland and moved to Ottawa, where he established a candy and tobacco store.
Along with his brothers, young Jules cared for the horses that pulled a carriage that sold goods to other stores, and he also worked in the warehouse. When he was seven, he played a vital role in the family business when his father burned his hands at the warehouse. His grandmother gave Jules a tube of burn ointment and sent him racing down Rideau Street on his tricycle to aid the family patriarch. It is thought that he actually went to work for the family firm a year later.
Meanwhile, he attended local schools and graduated from the Ottawa High School of Commerce. Later, at the bidding of his father, he attended agricultural college in the British territory of Palestine.
"My grandfather wanted each of his boys to do something different," said Ms. Loeb, who speculated that he probably also thought it would be a wise move for a grocery business to have someone who knew how food is grown.
In the mid-1930s, Mr. Loeb returned home to Ottawa and one evening soon after he attended a community baseball game. He struck up a conversation with a girl who had always lived near him in the neighbourhood. The girl would become his wife of 66 years, Fay. "There was never anybody else for me or for him," Mrs. Loeb said.
After a short stint in the Royal Canadian Air Force in Trenton, Ont., during the Second World War, Mr. Loeb returned to work with the family grocery. Ultimately, he rose to become one of the principals in the firm, by then a national chain under the guidance his brother, Bertram. Mr. Irwin said that Mr. Loeb always arrived at work early and left late. After the death of Moses Loeb in 1951, Bertram brought the American chain IGA to Canada.
The chain expanded quickly, but one by one the brothers - including Jules - sold their stock and turned to other interests, leaving Bertram to lead the business. In 1999, Montreal's Metro Inc. bought the firm. Some 40 stores in Ottawa and north-eastern Ontario still carry the Loeb name. "That was always something he was very proud of, having helped forge one of the leading commercial institutions of Canada," Mr. Irwin said.
In the 1960s, Mr. Loeb began building a real-estate portfolio, constructing and then operating apartment buildings and hotels. He built the Embassy Hotel in Ottawa and what was the Park Lane Hotel before it became a Ramada. He also opened a small chain of department stores in the area. "He had a busy financial life and it was all fun," said Mrs. Loeb, who added that he was extremely active. "There wasn't anything he wasn't raring to do. If anybody wanted to go anywhere on a trip on anything, he was ready to go with them. Let's go, let's go."
Mr. Loeb also began backing other entrepreneurs. Some ventures worked, others didn't. Among those that flourished were investments in natural resources, the fishing industry, a business that used innovative technology to grow tomatoes, and another that helped develop halogen lighting.
Mr. Irwin described Mr. Loeb as a leader who could provide good business advice. "He always said to these fellows who he was involved with, just work harder, keep your head down and we'll get to the end result in a positive attitude. That was his fashion."
In the midst of it all, Mr. Loeb turned his attention to politics, becoming the mayor of Lucerne, Que., across the river from Ottawa. Then he decided to take a run at federal politics, but his bid for a Liberal seat was less successful. "Fortunately, as he said, he didn't make it, because he wasn't going to enjoy politics," Mrs. Loeb said.
Indeed, politics once left a painful bite. In the early 1990s, he came under fire as a member of the Official Residences Council that advised the National Capital Commission to purchase $150,000 of used furniture from Mila Mulroney. Brian Mulroney had established the council in 1984 after he was elected prime minister. At the time, the council was accused of being politically motivated since all its members had been appointed by Mr. Mulroney.
For Mr. Loeb's part, politics had not entered into it. He would have landed on the council anyway because of his reputation as a first-rate art collector.
Years earlier, the Loebs had decided to build an art collection, although Mrs. Loeb said they didn't start out as collectors; rather, they began buying works simply because they liked them. Initially, they took a trip to France with the idea they might purchase European works but soon realized that was beyond their means.
Back home, they decided no one was collecting Canadian art and began looking around. They collected the works of early Canadian artists, from Cornelius Krieghoff on up. The collection attracted the attention of Pierre Theberge, current director of the National Gallery of Canada. In 1970, Mr. Theberge put together an exhibit featuring works from the Loeb collection that travelled to major galleries across Canada.
Mr. Theberge described the collection as an exemplary accumulation of Canadian historical art up to the 20th century, bringing together every important artist leading up to that time. "It's a wonderful project and very successfully done," he said. "It's very difficult to do something like that for a private collector. But they had the conviction. They had the eye. They had the ambition."
Today, works from the collection have been donated to virtually all the major galleries across Canada. Nor were the donations his only philanthropic work. Audrey Loeb said he led campaigns on behalf of Otttawa's Jewish community when he was younger and helped with the United Way Appeals, bond drives and other good causes.
In his later years, Mr. Loeb spent time in Mexico and Naples, Florida, where he was a famously terrible golfer. "He was lousy," Audrey said, "but he loved it. My father's greatest joy was to find golf balls on the course."
Mr. Irwin recalled that in games with Mr. Loeb, the businessman would "slash at the ball with his driver," causing the ball to soar majestically to the left - very far left - eliciting a curse from the golfer. And Mr. Loeb's other daughter said that her father was known to swear, complain and throw the occasional club, "but if you were to ask him how his golf was that day, he would reply, 'I had such a relaxing day.' "
JULES LOEB
Jules Loeb was born Oct. 3, 1917, at the Ottawa Civic Hospital. He died Sept. 15, 2008, of emphysema at home in Toronto. He was 90. He is survived by his wife, Fay, daughters Audrey and Karen, and grandchildren Tracie Heather and Greg. He also leaves David, the last of the six Loeb brothers.

Abstract: Ireland, too, enjoyed a borrowing spree, a financial services and real estate feast that first created indigestion and this year was coming close to a famine. Ireland is the first European Union economy to tip into recession and on Tuesday Dublin went further than anyone. In an 11th hour bid to prevent a run on Ireland's biggest savings institutions, Brian Lenihan, the Irish Finance Minister, said the government would guarantee not just retail depositors' money but commercial deposits.

Full text:   Step aside Henry Paulson; if you want to save global financial markets, you need to get serious. That means consulting the hard men in the financial salvage business, not in Washington or even on Wall Street. If you want a belt-and-braces repair job, head for Dublin and Reykjavik where the state is seizing the commanding heights of the economy.
The U.S. Treasury Secretary may think that his proposed $700-billion (U.S.) rescue of America's mortgage industry is the mother of all bailouts. The Republicans who stuck the spanner in the works certainly believed it was a bridge too far, not just creeping socialism but a financial Bolshevik putsch. But while Nancy Pelosi, the House Leader, exchanged insults with Republicans on Capitol Hill, Europeans were engaging with gusto in the dirty business of propping up teetering banks.
Britain nationalized Bradford & Bingley, the elderly former mutual society with a gammy leg that was quickly led into the same government stable as Northern Rock, its fellow Yorkshire lender, which failed over the summer. Both institutions will be put out to grass in the hope that in a few years' time they can be quietly sold off. Meanwhile, Ireland is creating uproar about unfair state aid by offering unlimited guarantees to depositors in Irish banks while the Dutch, Belgian, French and Luxembourg governments are busy corralling their own errant institutions.
In a co-ordinated rescue agreed to on Sunday, the Benelux governments each took minority stakes of 49 per cent in the Fortis operations in their respective states at a total cost of EUR11-billion ($16.4-billion Canadian). And on Tuesday, another avalanche of taxpayer euros was pumped into Dexia when France stepped up to the plate, alongside Luxembourg and, again, Belgium, to rescue the bank, which specializes in lending to local governments. France is putting EUR3-billion into the EUR6-billion package and the French taxpayers will end up owning 28 per cent of Dexia.
This won't frighten the pigeons on the Champs élysees - only 14 years ago, the French state bailed out Credit Lyonnais after the bank went on a mad lending spree, accumulating EUR23-billion in debt.
The speed at which the European governments acted reflects their pragmatic approach to bank insolvency - it's just another bust business with the additional problem that the institutions are custodians of money that belongs to voters. The solution is to take control and let public borrowing go rip, for a while. France can add a few more billions to the government balance sheets without too much hysteria but the same cannot truly be said for the dramatic action taken by the Irish and Icelandic governments.
Iceland has taken over Glitnir, injecting EUR600-million for a three-quarter share of the bank, which has been gradually starved of cash after a catastrophic fall in its share price. For this tiny country, the funds represent a cheque of $3,000 from every man, woman and child. Iceland's top three banks, Kaupthing, Landsbanki and Glitnir went on a helter-skelter international expansion over the past decade and their total assets have ballooned to 10 times the size of Iceland's economy.
Ireland, too, enjoyed a borrowing spree, a financial services and real estate feast that first created indigestion and this year was coming close to a famine. Ireland is the first European Union economy to tip into recession and on Tuesday Dublin went further than anyone. In an 11th hour bid to prevent a run on Ireland's biggest savings institutions, Brian Lenihan, the Irish Finance Minister, said the government would guarantee not just retail depositors' money but commercial deposits. Every loan and debt of the six Irish banks - Allied Irish Bank, Bank of Ireland, Anglo-Irish Bank, Irish Life & Permanent, Irish Nationwide Building Society and Educational Building Society - has a government promise to pay.
The effect was dramatic, pushing shares in Allied Irish up 68 per cent, and it did cause a run on deposits. Not on Allied Irish but on British banks as nervous savers and commercial depositors rushed to open English pound accounts in Irish banks in a quest for safe homes for cash. British bankers are in a rage, complaining that Ireland has run a coach and horses through the EU prohibitions on state aid and the British government is now under pressure to consider a similar move. Panicking, Prime Minister Gordon Brown rushed through a proposal to lift the ceiling on the government's deposit insurance scheme from £35,000 to £50,000 ($94,225).
It may not be enough and Ireland is not out of the woods. The massive guarantee worth some EUR400-billion is likely to trash the country's sovereign debt rating - a very expensive gesture as Ireland wades into what could be a long recession.

Full text:   German Finance Minister says region's problems less severe than in U.S.; conflicting views could deepen rift in 27-nation EU
France is leading calls for a common European Union response to fallout from the global financial crisis, but Germany's Finance Minister said in an interview yesterday that Berlin wasn't interested in French proposals for a joint bailout fund and a Europe-wide financial regulator.
Conflicts between leaders of two of Europe's biggest and closest economies over how to handle the financial crisis could deepen rifts within the 27-nation bloc about how to conduct and regulate finance as governments struggle to rescue international banks with domestic taxpayers' money.
The U.K. government continues to discuss its own rescue plan. Options under consideration include: a U.K. fund like the U.S. plan to buy banks' toxic assets; deposit insurance; and a way to swap assets such as securities for government-issued bonds or instruments that might not require market valuations. One idea floated, a pan-European fund, appears less likely.
German Finance Minister Peer Steinbruck rejected talk of pan-European bailout funds yesterday, saying Europe's financial difficulties aren't as deep as those of the U.S.
"To put it mildly, Germany is highly cautious about such grand designs for Europe," he said. "Other countries are free to think about it. I just don't see any German interest in it." Ireland's decision to guarantee the deposits and debt of its six biggest banks also drew a barely veiled rebuke from the EU's top regulator yesterday. Britain, some of whose banks operate in Ireland and wouldn't benefit from the draft plan, said it wants Dublin to re-examine the details.
As a new wave of financial turmoil hit European shores this week, calls have mounted for a pan-European response, with European Commission President José Manuel Barroso and Luxembourg Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker joining the chorus. "I think we need to systematize the European response," Mr. Juncker said.
An aide to French President Nicolas Sarkozy said talks were under way for top European policy makers including the leaders of Germany, the U.K. and Italy to discuss the crisis at a summit in Paris, possibly over the weekend. It's unclear, however, how much they would be able to agree.
France has said it wants to discuss ideas including a European fund to bail out distressed banks and a pan-European banking regulator. Mr. Sarkozy has said he is concerned that the EU, with its system of national financial regulation, is ill-equipped to cope with the potential failure of a major multinational bank.
French Finance Minister Christine Lagarde, in an interview with German newspaper Handelsblatt due for publication today, said the EU fund should be available to bail out banks when an individual country can't cope. A spokesman for Ms. Lagarde said it was "an idea worth debating, not a proposal."
The International Monetary Fund and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development also said Europe needs to co-ordinate its response. "Considering the exposure of European financial institutions, we might have to start thinking of a systemic plan for Europe," said OECD Secretary-General Angel Gurría.
So far, however, policy makers in Europe have responded to a string of threatened bank collapses with widely varying local solutions.
Mr. Steinbrück said yesterday that despite the wave of bank bailouts by European governments in recent days, the crisis facing the region isn't as deep as in the United States. He said Europe's ad hoc rescues of banks and informal consultation between the region's governments and central banks are working well so far.
"The origin and centre of gravity of the problem is clearly in the USA," Mr. Steinbruck said. Germany's government argues the country's banking system is more robust thanks to its large co-operative and savings-bank sectors, which have been barely affected by the widening turmoil in trans-Atlantic credit markets.
German banks have written off tens of billions of euros in assets since the U.S. subprime-mortgage meltdown in summer 2007, however, and some critics believe Mr. Steinbruck is being complacent.
German officials are opposed in particular to any European plan that would mirror U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson's proposed $700-billion purchase of banks' bad assets. Mr. Steinbruck questioned why German taxpayers should have to pay up "to stabilize situations for which other countries are responsible." The U.K. is also skeptical of such a fund, according to people familiar with the matter.
By contrast, Germany supports efforts to beef up the regulation of international finance. Mr. Steinbruck said he supported proposals from Europe's top financial regulator, European internal markets commissioner Charlie McCreevy, to improve bank oversight.
"We need more co-operation and convergence of oversight in Europe - that's the right way forward," Mr. Steinbruck said. "But this grand design with a pan-European umbrella; I don't know what that is meant to look like. Unless it means the Germans should pay," he said.

Full text:   'A day of desperation' as five countries scramble to announce bank bailout packages
Plummeting confidence in the European financial system triggered bailout packages in five countries yesterday and sent stock indexes into a downward spiral, even before U.S. lawmakers rejected a proposed $700-billion (U.S.) rescue package.
With European markets poised for another massive selloff today, French President Nicolas Sarkozy called for European policy makers to meet in Paris next week to plan for a global summit on the financial crisis. Speaking in Marseille, he called for support for the banks and a new international financial system.
As the U.S.-bred financial crisis surged through the European banking market and confidence evaporated with alarming speed, European economists were generally pessimistic about the fortunes of the European, and global, banking systems.
"What should have been a day of hope turned into a day of desperation," Marco Annunziata, chief economist in London for Italy's UniCredit bank, said in a note after the market bloodbath yesterday.
"We are facing a systematic crisis of confidence in the global financial system that is pushing us close to complete meltdown ... the [European] policy makers' insistence that the problem would remain confined to the U.S. smacked of a complaisance which has now backfired."
Europe has no comprehensive plan to rescue its financial systems in the case of widespread banking failures. There is no equivalent of TARP - the $700-billion Troubled Assets Relief Program designed to stabilize the U.S. financial system that is going back to the drawing board after its rejection in the U.S. House of Representatives yesterday.
Furthermore, the banking crisis arrived when the European economy was already deteriorating. "The boundaries of this problem are not known," said Mike Lenhoff, chief strategist at Brewin Dolphin, Britain's largest private-client investment manager. "There is a complete lack of trust and confidence in the capacity of the bank system to function. The market is not even discriminating between good and bad banks."
Many European banks lost 20 per cent or more yesterday as European stocks fell the most in eight months. Europe's Stoxx 600 index fell 5.5 per cent to 251.43, the steepest decline since Jan. 21. It is down 31 per cent this year.
The banking selloff was triggered by rescue packages announced for four European banks. The biggest victim by far was Fortis, the dominant bank and insurance group in the Benelux countries - Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg. The governments of each of the three countries agreed to pump EUR11.2-billion ($16.1-billion U.S.) of fresh capital into the bank in what analysts called a partial nationalization. The rescue will see each of the governments buy 49 per cent of the banking subsidiaries in their countries.
Still, the rescue package failed to steady shareholders' nerves. Fortis finished down almost 24 per cent, to EUR3.97. A year ago, they were trading at about EUR25.
Fortis's ample portfolio of assets backed by U.S. mortgages had been spooking investors. But the main cause of the selloff appeared to be its role, along with Royal Bank of Scotland and Spain's Santander, in the EUR71-billion purchase and breakup last year of the Dutch bank ABN Amro.
The deal strained Fortis's balance sheet and the credit crisis made it impossible to raise capital to help finance the purchase. "They took on ABN at exactly the wrong time," said Wolfgang Schuck, CEO of Maple Bank, a private bank that operates in Germany and Canada. "It was probably too big for them."
As Fortis was being rescued, the British government took control of Bradford & Bingley, a medium-sized mortgage lender. The government is nationalizing the £42-billion ($76-billion U.S.) mortgage book, whose default rate was climbing as the British property market soured. Santander, the Spanish banking giant, agreed to buy Bradford & Bingley's £21-billion deposit book and 197 branches for about £600-million.
Two other European banks, Germany's Hypo Real Estate, a property-financing bank, and Iceland's Glitnir Bank, were also offered lifelines as the financial crisis spread like wildfire. Hypo was offered a credit line from a group of local financial institutions. It did not reveal the size of the loan, though media reports put it at about EUR35-billion. Still, investors abandoned Hypo shares, sending them down 74 per cent to EUR3.52. J.C. Flowers & Co., the New York investment fund, has lost a fortune on Hypo. It paid EUR22.50 a share for almost 25 per cent of the German bank last year.
Late yesterday, the Belgian government promised to stand behind Dexia, a French-Belgian specialist in lending to local governments that ran up huge losses in its U.S. operations and closed nearly 30 per cent lower yesterday at EUR7.20.
Which European bank will get hit next is anyone's guess. Mr. Schuck of Maple Bank thinks the worst may be over because many of the big European banks had more cautious lending and investing practices than their American counterparts. He warned, however, that the rapidly deteriorating Spanish real estate market could blow holes into several Spanish banks.
But a London banker who did not want to be identified expects more trouble because many European banks, he said, became reckless in the syndication market in recent years. Massive loans originated by U.S. banks, from real estate deals to leveraged buyouts, were carved up and sold to a broad array of European banks and hedge funds.

Abstract: The Philadelphia Inquirer's long-time hockey writer, Tim Panaccio, accepted a buyout after he was taken off the Flyers beat and assigned to cover the Philadelphia Eagles. Panaccio says he was told by the newspaper's sports editor, Jim Cohen, that hockey was "an irrelevant sport" and that in Philadelphia, the Eagles "far outweighed anything else."

Full text:   Economic woes combined with cutbacks in the newspaper business will reduce the level of print coverage given the NHL in some U.S. markets.
In Florida, The Palm Beach Post decided last week to discontinue staff coverage of the Florida Panthers.
The Post's veteran beat writer, Brian Biggane, was assigned to the Miami Dolphins. None of the Panthers' home or away games will be staffed by the Post.
The Los Angeles Times has chosen to use just one beat reporter to cover both the Kings and the Anaheim Ducks, with Helene Elliott continuing to write hockey columns.
The Times will not staff road games for either the Kings or the Ducks on a regular basis. Sports editor Randy Harvey said in an email message that reporters will "travel selectively, probably not early in the season."
Both the Post and Times endured deep staffing cuts during the summer.
At the Post, 40 per cent of the newspaper's staff was chopped; the sports department's roster dropped to 13 from 21.
Palm Beach County, despite its affluence, has been hit hard by the U.S. housing crisis. The Post has likewise suffered.
As well, interest in the Panthers has flagged. The team hasn't been in the playoffs since 2000. The Post has decided to focus its resources on the Dolphins, baseball's Florida Marlins and the Miami Heat of the NBA.
The Los Angeles Times laid off 135 employees during the summer, 13 in the sports department, including Ducks beat writer Eric Stephens.
The newspaper has been in a state of turmoil, it seems, since Chicago real estate developer Sam Zell bought Tribune Co., which includes the Times, in April of 2007.
In addition to the Times' cutbacks, reduced coverage of the two Los Angeles area NHL teams is attributable to hockey ranking near the bottom of the pecking order in a market that has two teams in baseball's postseason, the USC football team near the top of the college ranking and two NBA teams opening training camp.
The Philadelphia Inquirer's long-time hockey writer, Tim Panaccio, accepted a buyout after he was taken off the Flyers beat and assigned to cover the Philadelphia Eagles. Panaccio says he was told by the newspaper's sports editor, Jim Cohen, that hockey was "an irrelevant sport" and that in Philadelphia, the Eagles "far outweighed anything else."
Panaccio was replaced on the Flyers beat by a former high school sports reporter who was the Philadelphia Phillies' backup reporter.
Philadelphia is among the NHL's leading U.S. markets.
A call to Cohen was not returned.
The good news for the NHL in Philadelphia is that both the Inquirer and Daily News are expected to staff the Flyers' home and away games.
The New York Times will continue to focus most of its attention on the Rangers. In terms of coverage on the road, sports editor Tom Jolly said by e-mail, that the Times will pick its spots.
"Obviously we're based in New York and, as a result, we pay special attention to the teams based here," he wrote. "But, we're an international news organization and thus have a much broader mission than covering every game played by every local team."
The Washington Post will give home and away coverage to the Capitals, but a reduction in section space might result in fewer stories.
JAYS AUDIENCES
The Toronto Blue Jays produced the sort of season-average TV audience you would expect from a team that struggled, enjoyed an up-tick in September, but fell well short of competing for a berth in the postseason.
Rogers Sportsnet, the principal carrier (100 games), averaged 303,700 viewers, down 1 per cent from 2007.
Sportsnet's top audience was 506,888 viewers on April 6, against Boston Red Sox. The CBC, with a schedule of 24 weekend telecasts, averaged 367,000 viewers, up 11 per cent from last year. The largest audience was 668,000 viewers on Sept. 13 (Jays at Boston Red Sox).
TSN did well with its 21-game schedule, averaging 419,000, up 11 per cent from 2007. TSN's most watched game was Jays at Chicago White Sox on Sept. 9, 650,000 viewers.
* Sportsnet will pick up the telecast of the White Sox-Minnesota Twins tiebreaker tonight at 7:30 ET.
* TSN analyst Pierre McGuire says the Montreal Canadiens may have the fastest team speed in the NHL, "from the top end to the bottom end. And their skill level is unbelievable. They're really fun to watch."
* Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band will perform during the 2009 Super Bowl halftime. NBC will televise the Feb. 1 game.

Despite 'unacceptable' practices, doctor avoids serious allegations

Author: Hammer, Kate

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/despite-unacceptable-practices-doctor-avoids/docview/382681676/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: In three separate reviews of Dr. Poon's patient charts submitted to the college's discipline committee, experts found evidence of "unsafe" and "unacceptable" practices. These included the discharge of patients minutes after eight- and 10-hour-long procedures, administering nearly double the recommended safe dose of local anesthetic and performing numerous complex procedures at once on a single patient.

Full text:   The most serious allegations against a family doctor accused of endangering his patients by performing cosmetic surgery without proper training were dropped yesterday as he pleaded no contest to lesser allegations and the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario restricted him from performing most surgical procedures.
Jimmy Poon, a Toronto-area family physician, performed invasive procedures including liposuction, breast augmentation and vaginoplasty without formal surgical training, until a patient complaint launched a college investigation. He will be allowed to continue his family practice, but will be subjected to unannounced inspections and required to take a physician review course.
The decision was based upon a joint submission from Dr. Poon's lawyer and the lawyer for the college, and approved by a disciplinary panel consisting of three doctors and two members of the public.
It comes more than a year after the death of Krista Stryland, a 32-year-old real-estate agent who died shortly after a liposuction procedure performed by another general practitioner. That renewed pressure on the college and the province to more effectively police cosmetic surgical procedures not covered by OHIP.
Piecemeal regulation changes were recently proposed by the college to Queen's Park, but have yet to take effect. As the first disciplinary hearing relating to cosmetic surgery, Dr. Poon's case has set a precedent.
Despite evidence that Dr. Poon "fell below the standard of practise in his performance of cosmetic procedures, his administering of anesthesia for cosmetic surgical procedures and in his charting, there's no evidence of misconduct or standards issues in relation to his family practice," college lawyer Lisa Spiegel said.
Dr. Poon's lawyer, David Leonard, who appeared at the hearing on his client's behalf, pleaded no contest to allegations that Dr. Poon failed to maintain the standard of practice of the profession.
"They've struck an appropriate balance in terms of what the college is concerned about with Dr. Poon's practice, addressing the public's concern and allowing him to carry on the rest of his practice, where there were no concerns expressed," Mr. Leonard said.
In three separate reviews of Dr. Poon's patient charts submitted to the college's discipline committee, experts found evidence of "unsafe" and "unacceptable" practices. These included the discharge of patients minutes after eight- and 10-hour-long procedures, administering nearly double the recommended safe dose of local anesthetic and performing numerous complex procedures at once on a single patient.
"Dr. Poon's care displays a woeful lack of knowledge and judgment," wrote one of the reviewers, Peter Neligan, chief of plastic surgery at the University Health Network.
Allegations that Dr. Poon "breached a term, condition and limitation on his certificate of registration," that he "engaged in disgraceful, dishonourable or unprofessional conduct," and that he is "incompetent," were dropped.

Full text:   Neither of Tampa Bay's new owners gives the impression of being a smooth boardroom operator, David Shoalts says, but they're audacious, rich and have a track record of taking risks that pay off
Since convincing Bill Davidson to take back a big mortgage and sell them the Tampa Bay Lightning last June, former hockey players Oren Koules and Len Barrie have been making audacious gambles in a league where gamblers usually crash and burn.
Jettisoned amidst a controversial run of hirings and firings were team president Ron Campbell, general manager Jay Feaster, head coach John Tortorella and a large group of front-office personnel, scouts and players (the most unpopular of which was fan-favourite defenceman Dan Boyle being shipped off to the San Jose Sharks).
Former first-overall NHL draft pick Brian Lawton was given his first management job as the Lightning's executive vice-president of hockey operations, and Barry Melrose was hired as head coach even though he had not been behind an NHL bench in 13 years.
In a three-month span, Koules and Barrie committed a whopping $194-million (all currency U.S.) in guaranteed contracts - nearly equalling the $206-million purchase price of the franchise.
Inside hockey circles and in media reports, they've been bashed as brash upstarts, with their financial wherewithal questioned and hockey acumen lampooned. And most of those critics haven't yet heard of the real-estate scheme that underpins the financing.
During a radio interview this month, Tortorella referred to them as a "couple of cowboys." Adding: "I have zero respect for them."
Stung by the jabs, both men dearly want to see the critics eat their words.
"With every breath I take," Koules said. "Every breath."
The Lightning owners made their fortunes in movies and real estate.
Koules, 47, who played junior hockey in the WHL and a bit in the minor leagues, made his big score in Hollywood by producing the successful TV sitcom Two and a Half Men and the Saw franchise of horror movies, which is reported to have generated $400-million in profits.
After failing to buy the Lightning a year ago in partnership with former Columbus Blue Jackets president Doug MacLean and South Florida developer Jeff Sherrin, Koules was introduced to Barrie by former NHL player Luc Robitaille. That's when the next Lightning ownership group was born.
Barrie, 39, played 184 NHL games over 12 years as a professional hockey player before making his name in real estate with the 1,300-acre Bear Mountain golf resort and housing development near Victoria.
The project, already at a reported $400-million in sales, may have potential sales of $2.5-billion.
"My biggest issue is that in all the press we got, there is this misconception that we are two guys in a candy store," Koules said. "We actually planned this down to every position, down to every player.
"We really took our time. But we keep reading we're kids in a candy store or playing fantasy hockey. It's the opposite."
They hope the on-ice moves will quickly turn the Lightning into a playoff team, which in turn sparks a surge at the gate in the Florida sun-belt market, where the club's season-ticket sales fell to 9,800 from 13,000 last season. The additional revenue is needed to make the team a consistent contender and pay off about $106-million in loans.
The sale of the Lightning, approved prior to the 2008 NHL entry draft, included 5½ acres of waterfront land next to the St. Pete Times Forum.
Koules and Barrie plan to develop the land, although Davidson, who also owns the NBA's Detroit Pistons, never managed to get started on the project in the nine years he had the NHL team - and that was before the current crisis in the U.S. financial markets.
Similar plans to build around arenas and stadiums have been drawn up in Ottawa, Anaheim, Dallas, Phoenix and other centres with uneven success at best.
"We don't have the luxury of making enormous mistakes," Lawton said.
Neither Koules nor Barrie give the impression of being smooth boardroom operators with the knack of persuading sponsors and politicians to climb aboard, but they have a track record of taking risks and having them pay off.
For a recent interview, Koules wore a sports shirt and jeans, while his hair appeared to have been styled with a hand blender. Barrie's coiffure looked dishevelled and expensively streaked ("Mr. Frosted Hair," Koules called him), and he wore a sports jacket over a T-shirt and fashion jeans full of holes.
Koules quit his job as a commodities trader at his hometown Chicago Mercantile Exchange in 1992 to make movies. He didn't know anyone in Hollywood but headed west anyway.
Finding few employment opportunities for a 31-year-old would-be producer with a Grade 10 education, he started his own production company. A few years later, Saw and its sequels followed, the latest of which, Saw V , "opens Oct. 24," Koules said. "Make sure you mention that."
Barrie got rich after his golf club in Victoria forced him to give up his membership when he cut down some trees to improve the view on his neighbouring property, or at least what he thought was his property.
He retaliated by buying 1,300 acres on Bear Mountain in 2001, and talking several hockey buddies, including Mike Vernon and Joe Nieuwendyk into investing. Jack Nicklaus designed two golf courses, and Barrie withstood the protests of outraged environmentalists and local citizens to open the development.
Lawton, 43, was the No. 1 pick in the 1983 NHL draft, chosen by Minnesota North Stars GM Lou Nanne ahead future stars Steve Yzerman and Pat LaFontaine.
Lawton became an agent when his playing career ended in 1993, but he had always wanted to run an NHL team. Lawton quit his job with the Octagon management company a year ago to pursue a GM job, and got hired by the Lightning after preparing a 50-page document that plotted the team's quick transformation into a contender.
Koules and Barrie call it "the manifesto" and many of their moves have come from it.
"[Koules] called me and said, 'Have you read this?' " Barrie said. "I said, 'Yeah, this guy might be a perfect fit.'
"There's stuff on the GM side that we don't want to do, but Brian really thrives on it," he said. "We make group decisions. When the puck drops, we're all accountable together because we all agreed together."
A close look at all three aspects of the Lightning deal make it hard to argue with them.
Both Barrie and Koules say the existing on-ice talent on the Lightning did not justify a last-place finish in 2007-08. They say their harshest critic, Tortorella, had a lot to do with that.
"We thought the biggest issue last year was that the coach was very divisive," Koules said. "It wasn't a solid dressing room of 20 players. To have 20 guys going in the same direction, with the amount of talent we assembled, is very important."
Hence the hiring of Melrose, who took the Los Angeles Kings to the 1993 Stanley Cup final but had stayed in the television business after he was fired two years later.
On the player side, only five of the 18 players given one-way contracts this summer spent any time with last season's team but, the management trio argues, most are under 30.
Among the older players, Vaclav Prospal, 33, is in his third go-round with the team and has a proven track record as a consistent scorer on the top line with Vincent Lecavalier and Martin St. Louis.
Veteran forwards Gary Roberts, 42, and Mark Recchi, 40, were brought in as mentors to prize 18-year-old rookie Steven Stamkos, the first overall pick in the June draft, who will play centre on the second line.
Thirty-eight-year-old goaltender Olaf Kolzig was signed to cover another gamble.
The new owners were behind a multiplayer deal in which star forward Brad Richards went to the Dallas Stars for two players, a draft pick and Mike Smith, who is being asked to solve Tampa's goaltending woes. Kolzig is here because he will be either a solid backup to Smith or the No. 1 if Smith falters.
Koules has a ready response to any questions about Smith, the former Dallas backup who was 3-10 after arriving in Tampa last February.
"There was an erroneous report on the first day of free agency that we wanted to trade Mike Smith," Koules said. "The first two calls we got were from [Stars GM] Les Jackson and [former Stars GM] Doug Armstrong. Then, we got one from [Vancouver Canucks GM] Mike Gillis, who used to be his agent.
"What's that tell you about Smith?"
Both owners spent a lot of time selling themselves and the team to the free agents they wanted to sign. They proved to be persuasive.
"They really did give me the feeling they wanted to win right away," Roberts said. "I felt with guys like Lecavalier and St. Louis, they weren't really a 30th-place team. With the addition of the other guys, I think we're a definite contender this season."
Koules and Barrie's most important sales job was on Lecavalier, 28. The franchise's first-overall pick in 1998 was impressed enough to forgo a shot at free agency at the end of this season and sign an 11-year contract extension.
"It feels like a new team," said Lecavalier, who led Tampa with 40 goals and 92 points last season. "When you get new ownership, you think about it, but these guys are just so passionate about the game, I wanted to be here."
With Stamkos between free-agent newcomers Ryan Malone and Radim Vrbata plus Lecavalier's line, the Lightning will not have trouble scoring. But questions abound about the defence, which was the worst in the league last season. The co-owners have some answers here, too.
For example, Matt Carle, who arrived in the Boyle trade, was a promising rookie for the Sharks two years ago, before a poor sophomore season made him expendable. Carle told reporters he got into a personality conflict with then-Sharks coach Ron Wilson, which affected his play.
"He is going to become an elite NHL defenceman," Melrose said of Carle.
Melrose promises a far more physical team, one that fore-checks hard and is strong in its own end.
"Everyone's picking on our defence because it's young," he said. "When I went to the Stanley Cup final, I had two 21-year-old defencemen and one 20-year-old. They played 25 minutes a night.
"Just because you're young doesn't mean you can't be great. I expect a lot from our kids."
Expectations and accountability are the two buzzwords in what Lawton calls a "no-excuses organization."
The dressing rooms, medical rooms and weight room were all renovated for the players, who also received a number of other perks. In exchange, it was made clear management expects an all-out effort on the ice.
"That was communicated very firmly this morning in our first meeting," Lawton said, the day training camp opened last week.
The men in charge of the team say turnarounds can happen quickly in a salary-cap NHL. They point to the Philadelphia Flyers, who went from last place to the playoffs last season, as an example.
However, the Flyers are deep in young talent, while not one of the Lightning's top three picks in the last five years is on an NHL roster. That's one reason Feaster was fired. They have compensated with the one-way contracts for younger players.
With such a large group of new players, the team has to meld quickly. That is why the owners agreed to send the Lightning to Europe this weekend for an exhibition tour and to open the 2008-09 NHL season in Prague against the New York Rangers.
"Getting off to a good start for this team is really important," Roberts said. "You have to get to know your teammates and this trip will help us do that and get us off on the right foot."
The owners are similarly confident about winning back fans and turning a profit, although Davidson's executives at Palace Sports & Entertainment say the Lightning only turned a profit ($3.3-million) in the 2003-04 season, when they won the Stanley Cup. In nine years, they say, the company lost $80-million.
Koules and Barrie point to the team's attendance figures, which show a steady rise from the Stanley Cup year to the top three in the NHL, culminating with an average crowd of 20,509, above capacity, in 2005-06. Despite the last-place finish in 2007-08, the Lightning were still eighth in attendance with an average crowd of 18,692.
The owners say Tampa is the best hockey market among the sun-belt franchises and a properly managed team will make money. Their season-ticket sales are down, but from July 1 to Sept. 1, after the new ownership was introduced and made their plans known, team officials say 4,100 season-ticket packages were sold, the most ever for that period. Koules said sponsorship sales are up $3-million from this point last year.
It also helps that the team has a sweet arena deal.
It manages the St. Pete Times Forum, which is one of the busiest venues in the country. The Lightning keep all the revenue from the arena and pay no property taxes. And those renovations to the dressing room and weight room were paid for with a $35-million loan from the city spread over 14 years and is specifically for the upkeep of the arena.
Other NHL teams, such as the Ottawa Senators and Phoenix Coyotes, had ownerships fail when the team was tied to a real-estate play. But the key difference here is the arenas in Ottawa and Phoenix were built in remote suburbs, years ahead of development. The Tampa rink is downtown.
As for the two plots of land next to the rink, a local real-estate lawyer who's been studying the land since Davidson bought it along with the team in 1999, thinks it will pay off nicely once the current chaos in the financial markets dies down.
Davidson never developed the land because the two businessmen who were to spearhead the project died within six months of each other and he apparently lost interest. But lawyer Ron Weaver says the plots are ideal for the luxury hotel and condominium projects Barrie has in mind for both. They are near the waterfront, the arena, and the Tampa Convention Centre, which the city wants to expand. Weaver thinks Koules and Barrie could get upward of $400-million in sales.
"Things don't happen overnight," Barrie said. "Neither one of us bought this team to expect to turn this thing around and make $30-million in one year.
"We knew this was going to be a three-to-five-year plan and we intend to stick this out."

COACH BARRY MELROSE: MOTIVATOR
To find a new head coach, Tampa Bay Lightning co-owner Oren Koules turned to his friend, Luc Robitaille, who played on the 1992-93 Los Angeles Kings team coached by Barry Melrose. The Kings, led by Wayne Gretzky, lost the Stanley Cup final to the Montreal Canadiens.
"Whether you talked to Luc Robitaille, Rob Blake or Wayne Gretzky, they all said the one guy who gets everyone playing at or above their peak and going in the same direction was Barry Melrose," Koules said.
Melrose joined U.S. all-sports cable channel ESPN two years after that NHL final - and now says he's having too much fun after 13 years in a television studio to worry about those who ridiculed his appointment.
"You're so much more alive now," he said. "You're involved, you've got a dog in the hunt and that's important. I know most of those doubters and I don't really think too much of them. It's not like I have anything to prove to those guys. Most of them have never coached in their lives. And if they did, they were bad coaches."

Full text:   With five new high-end shops on Augusta alone, can the bohemians hold off the barbarians of gentrification any longer?
Good Egg, the new food-related bookstore that recently opened in Kensington Market, is just the latest sign that change is hatching in the reliably colourful bohemian neighbourhood.
Phil Pick, the real-estate agent who put Good Egg proprietor Mika Bareket into her bright storefront on Augusta Avenue north of Nassau Street, said four more new businesses have opened since the summer.
"I've done two restaurants, a health-food store and a coffee shop, in addition to the bookstore," said Mr. Pick, the sales representative for Esbin Realty, which manages several properties in the Market.
"I've been involved in Kensington Market for the last five years," he said, "and suddenly the rate of change has accelerated."
Chris Idrovo, owner of Pennylicks, one of the area's new cafes, said the influx has made north Augusta a high-traffic area.
"People are calling it the new Yorkville," Mr. Idrovo said as he whipped up cappuccino for customers. "You can't even park on the street any more, because it's gotten so busy."
Niche businesses like the crafts-rich Blue Banana Market, the vegan café Urban Herbivore and an older furniture store specializing in vintage modular teak, Bungalow, are changing the character of the strip. "They're getting away from the chickens in crates and the panhandlers," observed Jerry Crawford, a contractor with Sundial Properties, who said he has renovated 12 properties on Augusta, most of them storefronts, over the past six months. "It's become a lot more professional."
Change comes at a cost. Rents have doubled from an average of $17 a square foot, to $35 to $38 a square foot. Mr. Pick said that in the coming year rents may increase again, "as national brands like Starbucks, Timothy's, Second Cup or Lululemon come in to the neighbourhood," likely taking over an empty storefront at the corner of Nassau and Augusta that Mr. Pick listed last week, asking $5,000 a month to lease.
"We don't need another Yorkville," said Ossie Pavao, who runs Casa Açoreana, the bulk-food store that has been operating from the corner of Augusta and Baldwin for the past 45 years.
"There are already too many restaurants and cafes. Kensington Market is about shopping. What's left to shop for?"
"I don't think that the neighbourhood will stand for a Starbucks," said community activist Michael Louis Johnson, who helped introduce Pedestrian Sundays to the Market five years ago.
"The coffee shops that are here, like Luis' and I Deal Coffee, are community hubs. It's a community that defines itself in opposition to globalization and corporatization, everything that Starbucks stands for."
But Arja Chopra, owner of health-food store Sugar & Spice, an Augusta fixture for the past 15 years, believes that change is good for local businesses.
"The market was getting stale," she said, standing behind a counter piled with homeopathic flu remedies and sugar-free candy.
"People, like my new neighbour," she said, referring to Good Egg, "are bringing a new and different kind of customer here, people who spend money. That's much better than having a lot of vacancies, as we did have a couple of years ago, when every third store was empty."
Ms. Bareket, a former book buyer for the Queen West store Type, took over a 1,000-square-foot storefront that had housed a vintage clothing shop. Good Egg will serve up kitchen implements, serving ideas, food-storage containers, shopping bags and baskets, kitchen and dining linens, cards and food-related toys for children, Ms. Bareket said.
"I also gift-wrap, do registries and, in the new year, plan on offering small cooking workshops. I have a test kitchen in the store. Lastly, [I'm] putting together a community cookbook, proceeds from which will be donated to Oxfam."
Potsothy Sallapa, who owns 4-Life Natural Foods, a five-year-old business located just south of Ms. Bareket's new store, welcomes the changes. "It's a market," Mr. Sallapa said, calypso music pulsing in the background. "You need something fresh to keep the market culture alive."

Full text:   In a spare living room furnished with a bookshelf of Hebrew texts and special silverware for religious occasions, Rabbi Jacob Hirschman, 71, tallied up the locations of his grown children.
The two youngest, he says, still live in the family home, near Lawrence and Bathurst, and there are others studying in Los Angeles and Jerusalem. But his five married children all live in Lakewood, N.J.
Lakewood is an internationally renowned hub for the most traditional wing of Orthodox Judaism, as well as the terminus of what he describes as an arduous nine-hour drive from Toronto.
Rabbi Hirschman came here from Lakewood in 1970 to co-found the Institute for Advanced Judaic Study, or Kollel Toronto, an Orthodox rabbinical college with ties to Lakewood's giant Beth Medrash, considered the Harvard of Talmudic scholarship. Over the decades, Kollel attracted hundreds of devout Jews to the Lawrence-Bathurst area, which saw its Orthodox population boom.
But as Rabbi Hirschman prepared for the Jewish high holidays this week, he knew that an increasing number of the young people who grew up in this insular community no longer called Toronto home.
The vast majority moves to Lakewood, on New Jersey's south shore - and they don't return.
There's a very specific reason behind the exodus: the long-term escalation of real-estate prices, which remain elevated in spite of the recent softening in the market.
"From my [high-school] class, I'd say 60 to 70 per cent of those who got married have left town," says Dina, a 27-year-old mother of three.She moved with her husband from Toronto to Lakewood eight years ago. Dina, who asked that her surname not be published, is a social worker. Her husband is one of 5,000 students at Beth Medrash.
In Lakewood, they spent just $290,000 for a brand new five-bedroom townhouse in a cozy complex with a park and an Orthodox synagogue. The alternative was spending more than twice as much here on "a shack." While she misses her relatives, Dina says, "I'm very happy here. Lakewood has what I need."
Rabbi Hirschman insists moving to Lakewood "is not [exclusively] a Toronto phenomenon," pointing out that young Orthodox Jews from cities such as Detroit and Chicago make the same journey.
Yet others say the problem is particularly pronounced in the Lawrence-Bathurst area, where suitable homes have become unaffordable for many young Orthodox couples who expect to have as many as 10 children and need to live within walking distance of a traditional synagogue.
"It seems to me there's an economic crisis with Orthodox Judaism," says Yossi Sapirman, who grew up in the area and is now chief rabbi of Beth Torah, a conservative congregation near Dufferin and Lawrence. In his view, Orthodox Judaism in Toronto is increasingly limited to those who can afford the lifestyle.
With Orthodox Jews accounting for about 40 per cent of the Lawrence-Bathurst area's population, the census tract encompassing Lawrence-Bathurst has one of the highest household density rates in Canada, says David Nitkin, the president of a local residents' group.
Rabbi Shmuel Reidel, who teaches at Kollel, says family incomes are often limited because many teach or devote themselves to Talmud study.
What's more, highly traditional Orthodox Jews don't attend secular postsecondary institutions, which limits career options.
"Even though they have large families, they're not making more money than people with one or two children," Rabbi Reidel says.
He also points out that Orthodox families shoulder crushing tuition burdens as the children all attend parochial schools, which cost about $10,000 a year. He distributes used clothes and even food to needy families. "It's not an easy situation."
Mr. Nitkin and others tell stories of couples with four children living in two-bedroom flats, or a few large families jointly renting four- or six-plex apartment buildings and creating dorm-like communal rooms for girls and boys.
Condo builder Anthony Heller, who lives in the area, says many of the less affluent families must choose between finding cramped-but-scarce rental housing around Lawrence and Bathurst or settling permanently in Lakewood, which has seen a boom in low-cost townhouses built for large Orthodox families.
"The lack of housing is hollowing out the community," says Mr. Heller, who estimates there are now 400 Toronto Orthodox families in Lakewood. He added there are about 1,000 Orthodox families in the Lawrence-Bathurst enclave.
In desirable Toronto neighbourhoods, high house prices generally force young families to look elsewhere. But for Toronto's Orthodox Jews, the choices are less straightforward.
Strictly observant Orthodox Jews can't perform any work on the Sabbath. They're not allowed to drive, carry objects, or even push strollers. While certain accommodations are allowed, the spiritual bottom line is proximity to Orthodox synagogues - shuls , where men meet to study - and parochial schools. That requirement puts a premium on the available housing stock within a kilometre or two of the temples, most of which are off Bathurst around Lawrence.
"By default, you've got a lot of people concentrated in a small area," Rabbi Hirschman says.
In the past, hard-up couples could approach wealthy patrons, such as the Reichmann family, as well as informal loan societies, known as gemilas chesed , for help with down payments. But such financing has become riskier as prices increase, Rabbi Reidel says. "It's not always the smartest idea."
As the housing squeeze has worsened, some local developers have begun to look for alternatives. Rabbi Reidel is working with Options for Homes, a non-profit developer of low-cost condos, on an apartment just north of Lawrence and Bathurst.
The building may have up to 30 units with four bedrooms and kosher kitchens. When word went around, the waiting list filled up overnight. Options president Michel Labbé doesn't expect groundbreaking for 18 months.
Meanwhile, community leaders have begun tentatively talking to municipal officials about setting aside public land in the redevelopment of the Lawrence Heights housing complex, just a few blocks west, for apartments for Orthodox families.
The prospect of approaching the city is anathema for the Orthodox community, which prides itself on self-reliance, Rabbi Sapirman says. "They would be uncomfortable to ask for government help." And, as he notes, the idea that there's poverty within the Jewish community runs counter to stubborn but widely held stereotypes.
Rabbi Hirschman, for his part, has attended a few meetings with the city, but says it's still too soon to tell where they'll lead. Yet it will be years before shovels break ground.
In the meantime, more young families will leave Toronto, a trend that has those of Rabbi Hirschman's generation pondering their own futures.
"Down the road, if you have 10 children and six or seven are in Lakewood, where are you going to retire to?" he muses.
"What's keeping you here?"

Onex stalks bargain banks

Author: Erman, Boyd

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/onex-stalks-bargain-banks/docview/382754163/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: The firm, which is raising another $4.5-billion buyout fund, is also counting on more acquisition possibilities as big companies look to sell divisions to raise money. The trick is finding banks to lend the money for purchases. "Given the events of the last week or so, the markets have just fallen out of bed," Mr. [Gerald Schwartz] said. "Credit is simply not available on acceptable terms."

Full text:   Onex Corp. is adding distressed U.S. banks to its shopping list.
The Toronto-based buyout firm is on the hunt for acquisitions of small banks that have run into trouble during the financial crisis.
Gerald Schwartz, Onex's founder and chief executive officer, said the company has formed a partnership with John McCoy, the former head of Bank One Corp. and a member of Onex's board of directors.
Distressed banks with assets of about $1-billion (U.S.) to $10-billion are the most likely targets, which would put the potential price tag in the $50-million to $1-billion range in current markets.
If Onex could find a few banks in one region that it can acquire cheaply, the firm could combine and restructure them and seek to sell the larger entity to a big bank looking to expand once the financial sector regains its footing.
There are more than 7,000 banks in the U.S., many of them small lenders with just a few branches. Hundreds of those local banks are teetering under the weight of bad loans made to home buyers and construction companies that can't repay after the real estate bust. A dozen banks have already failed, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., and there were 117 more on the problem bank list as of June 30. "Small banks throughout America are enormously struggling," Mr. Schwartz told investors yesterday in Toronto.
However, before Onex can start buying, the firm must find a way around ownership restrictions that make it difficult for private equity firms to purchase banks.
Private equity firms have been lobbying the Federal Reserve to ease the regulations, and hunting for ways around them. J. Christopher Flowers, who founded buyout firm J.C. Flowers & Co., recently won approval to personally acquire a small Missouri bank that may be a jumping off point to buy other lenders. Mr. Schwartz declined to comment on how Onex would handle the restrictions.
"We have a way through the regulatory labyrinth that others in private equity haven't figured out how to do," he said. "We want to make some acquisitions before others figure out how to do it."
Onex has been widening its hunt for buyout targets as the economic carnage has increased. Along with banks, the firm is on the lookout for acquisitions in areas such as gambling, where debt-burdened casino companies like Tropicana Entertainment LLC have been forced into restructuring, and building products.
The firm, which is raising another $4.5-billion buyout fund, is also counting on more acquisition possibilities as big companies look to sell divisions to raise money. The trick is finding banks to lend the money for purchases. "Given the events of the last week or so, the markets have just fallen out of bed," Mr. Schwartz said. "Credit is simply not available on acceptable terms."

Full text:   Empty nesters are making Georgian Bay area a popular choice for year-round living
If you had to pick your dream wilderness retreat on a moment's notice, you could do a lot worse than Midland.
Wedged into a picturesque cove just south of Penatanguishene, it stands out as a testament to the beautiful solitude of Georgian Bay, the graceful wilderness that so many city-dwellers chase after during the sweltering summer months.
Midland has the added benefit of being slightly off the beaten path of the cottage-country milk run that winds north on Highway 11.
The town has fought valiantly to keep its lumber and shipping heritage alive in the 21st century, with mixed results. But the languorous lakeside, carping loons and dense forest aren't going anywhere.
With those elements safely intact, could Midland make the jump from vacation getaway to bedroom community for Greater Toronto?
Sure it's a two-hour drive from downtown Toronto - and that is with no traffic congestion. But all the other elements are there: The 400-series highway nearby, the affordable land prices, and the small but established community with good schools and health-care facilities.
In the summer of 2007, the Remington Group launched Captain's Cove looking out onto Georgian Bay and the Wye River valley. At the time, the developer released 61 bungalows for freehold ownership on expansive 50-foot lots, but this spring they added a four-storey condominium to the mix with 47 suites.
The target market was never in doubt, according to Michelle LaBrie, Remington's sales director.
"What we have found is that Captain's Cove is going to be a permanent address," said Ms. LaBrie. "But we weren't really sure at the beginning if that was going to be the case."
Nearly all of the buyers are empty nesters or people who have retired early but are a long way from becoming snowbirds, Ms. LaBrie said.
"We've had a few buyers who are still self-employed and can carry on their businesses from their home," she said.
What a growing number of buyers have found is that if you only have to be in the Greater Toronto Area once or twice a week, there's not much to stop you from living in the wilds of Georgian Bay full time.
Captain's Cove has sold about half of the condominium suites, and, if price is a factor, it's not hard to see why.
The suites are wrapped in a majestic Cape-Cod-style edifice that fits in with the nautical motif of the master-planned community (it also looks on to a large marina).
Prices start at $155,000 for a one-bedroom suite on the main floor with 638 square feet of living space and rise to $350,000 for a 1,423-square-foot one-bedroom-plus-loft suite.
It might be a little too early to declare Captain's Cove a harbinger of some "705" (the local area code) housing boom.
For one thing, nearby Barrie has seen a mini-boom of low-rise development over the past five years along the southern shore of Kempenfelt Bay and there is ample land to absorb new housing. For another, Midland - and most of what we know as cottage country - is not in a position to host traditional subdivisions thanks to natural barriers and a protective community of long-time residents.
But there is growing demand for a permanent residence in this niche market. That pressure looks destined to intensify in the coming years.

Full text:   74 BABY POINT RD.
What: A three-bedroom, 3½ -bathroom house built in 1920 in the Baby Point neighbourhood of west-end Toronto. The residence and grounds are featured prominently as the home of Kit in the film Kit Kittredge: An American Girl, which is currently playing in theatres.
Living space: 2,515 square feet
Lot size: 100 by 350 feet
Asking price: $2.3-million
Taxes: $13,605 (2008)
Agent: Royal LePage Real Estate Services Ltd. (Nutan Brown)
The first few times the film production company put letters into their mailbox, Rob and Ursula Doyle threw them out.
"We would like to use your house for a movie," the letter read. The scouts looking for locations for the filming of Kit Kittredge: An American Girl had travelled from Oshawa to Oakville looking for Kit's home, and 74 Baby Point Rd. appeared to be the ideal property.
"They indicated how much they were willing to pay and that changed everything," says Mr. Doyle, who agreed to give over the house for about three weeks. But weeks stretched into months and the disruption was much greater than the couple had anticipated.
Still, the Doyles don't regret their decision to answer the casting call. They had an insider's view of film-making throughout the process and - in the end - their house was left just as it had been before the trailers, crew and Hollywood stars descended on quiet Baby Point.
The American comedy-drama, which opened in theatres this summer, is based on a series of stories by Valerie Tripp, who also wrote the screenplay. Abigail Breslin plays Kit, a cub reporter who lives with her family in Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1934, during the Great Depression. (Julia Ormond, Stanley Tucci, Jane Krakowski and Joan Cusack also star.)
Mr. Doyle went to the Internet to look at illustrations from the book and saw a house almost identical to his own. "As soon as you looked at the pictures, you knew it was this house."
Built in 1920 by developer Robert Home Smith, it still retains some of its arts and crafts details. The original owner was the Bell family of W.H. Bell & Sons Furriers Ltd.
The spacious property backs on to a ravine, and overlooks the parks and trails along the Humber River. There are few apartment buildings or other modern intrusions in the background, which is a benefit for the residents, and also an advantage in shooting the film, Mr. Doyle notes.
But while the house was ideal for the film in many ways, some of the changes made to it over the years were not. Aluminum soffits and window frames, for example, didn't exist when the house was built.
"It turned out it wasn't all that perfect," Mr. Doyle says.
When the film crew took over, a sliding door leading to the deck off the breakfast area became a slamming screen door. Wood trim distressed to make it look old covered any interior wood that had been painted as well as any modern exterior elements.
The sunroom was almost entirely covered over, leaving only a small window opening. Traditional side-hinged garage doors were built to disguise the modern door.
The family room became Kit's bedroom, and the second-floor office became another bedroom.
Outside, the yard was turned into a Depression-era setting. The crew created a vegetable garden in the back, and planted fully grown carrots whole.
"They had to put a doghouse over the air conditioner to hide it," Mr. Doyle adds.
Most remarkably, the crew built a fake tree, which appeared "as real as real can be," he says. Then they brought in a huge crane and heavy equipment to erect a tree house.
"They had to have security guards here 24 hours a day to keep all the kids in the neighbourhood away from the tree house," Mr. Doyle says.
Everywhere, the property was covered with cameras, lights and equipment.
The Doyles were away during part of the filming, and they spent a few days in a hotel. But often they were on-site and still had access to much of the house.
To shoot the film, the backyard had to be roughed up. The underground sprinkler lines were cut, as were wires and cables that bring utilities to the house. "Anything that was buried in the yard - you name it, they got it," the homeowner says.
Vintage cars lined the street in front of the house during the shooting, and the crew's large trailers were parked around the neighbourhood.
Agent Nutan Brown, who lives down the street, says it was exciting for the neighbours to watch the progress at No. 74. "It almost became a family thing every night after dinner to wander over towards the Doyles and see what was happening."
To offset the disturbance to neighbours, the production company held an afternoon party at the Baby Point Club, the local centre for tennis and lawn bowling.
When filming wrapped up, the crew had the house back in order in about three days, the Doyles say. Rooms were repainted and art work rehung. Photos were taken prior to shooting in Mr. Doyle's office - right down to the contents of his cabinets - and the room was restored to its original state using these as guides.
The backyard took longer to restore, however; it had been trampled beyond recognition. The tree and tree house came down, the yellow-painted picket fence was taken away, and the gardens and grass were replanted.
The production company provided a generous budget for new landscaping, and the Doyles worked with the gardener to choose new trees and shrubs.
After only a few days, Baby Point was back to normal, 1934 was left behind, and the clock had advanced to 2008.
The amenities
The house is set on a double ravine lot in a leafy enclave above the Humber River. Inside, the main floor has large principal rooms, a sunroom, family room and a breakfast area overlooking the gardens.
The living room has a wood-burning fireplace and 11-foot ceilings. Granite countertops and stainless-steel appliances are featured in the renovated kitchen, which also has in-floor radiant heating.
Upstairs, the master suite, which can be closed off from the rest of the house, includes a bathroom, sitting room and dressing room. Another bedroom has been turned into an office and offers views of the ravine and a private deck.
Outside, the professionally landscaped yard and gardens feature a stone patio set above the ravine.

LISTING AGENT: Asher Horowitz, Realty Toronto Inc.
In Mississauga's established Rockwood community this two-storey, brick residence backing onto green space was an ideal fit for the local family who purchased it, said agent Asher Horowitz.
Not only is it close to friends and family, but it's also nearby natural and urban attractions.
"The location is very convenient, close to the airport, Etobicoke and highway," he said.
"It offered mature landscaping, generous size lot and more privacy in the rear."
Built in 1998, the home is typical of many properties in the subdivision.
It has a 2,800-square-foot plan with four bedrooms and three bathrooms.
The home boasts California shutters and wood flooring.
There are separate living and dining rooms and a family room with a gas fireplace.
A walkout to the deck and windows on three sides of the kitchen makes the space look almost like a greenhouse, says Mr. Horowitz.
"It's very bright and open. It's one of the best features of the house."
Also on the main floor are a powder room and laundry room connected to the double garage.
A grand winding staircase leads to the bedrooms, which are broadloom-covered, and a four-piece bathroom on the second floor.
The master suite boasts a five-piece bathroom with a separate shower and a whirlpool tub.
The home's built-in systems include alarm and central vacuum.

Full text: Thousands of community banks, worried about the mounting volume of bad construction and land loans, are clamouring for a piece of the government's proposed $700-billion (U.S.) bailout plan.
The proposal unveiled last week would allow the U.S. Treasury to spend up to $700-billion to buy soured residential and commercial mortgages and mortgage-related securities from financial institutions. But it isn't clear whether the bailout would include construction and land loans, especially those tied to condominiums and housing projects that are going bad at a rapid clip.
What happens is critical to the nation's community and regional banks, which are more exposed to construction lending than their bigger brethren. At the end of the second quarter, banks and thrifts controlled about $700-billion of land and construction loans, representing 9 per cent of all loans, according to Zelman & Associates.
Research firm Foresight Analytics LLC, of Oakland, Calif., estimates that construction-loan delinquencies among all property types reached 8.1 per cent in the quarter, up from 7.2 per cent in the first quarter and 2.4 per cent in the year-earlier period. Among loans to single-family-housing developers, 13 per cent of the loans were at least 30 days past due, compared with 11 per cent in the previous quarter and 3.1 per cent a year earlier.
"If the goal is to unclog the [financial] system, let's also unclog Main Street banks while we're at it," said Camden Fine, president and chief executive of Independent Community Bankers of America in Washington. Mr. Fine said his organization, which has more than 5,000 member banks, is in talks with Congress and the Treasury Department "to ensure we have a seat at the table."
Damian Kassab, chairman of Michigan-based Warren Bank, said he was "hitting the phones all weekend," calling local congressional representatives and the state banking association to lobby for assistance in the bailout.
"You can't address the root causes of this problem unless you deal with the real estate loans on the books of the community banks," Mr. Kassab said.
Mr. Kassab wants the Treasury to guarantee the community and regional banks' construction loans, which would allow the banks to shift their risk to the government. Terry Peterson, chief executive of Westsound Bank, based in Bremerton, Wash., also said the federal bailout shouldn't help Wall Street at the expense of community banks like his.
Mr. Peterson says Westsound may have to foreclose on nearly $40-million of land and other property by the end of the year.

Full text: Metals magnate buys 50-per-cent stake of big investment bank, predicts more to come
Days after the Kremlin unveiled a $120-billion rescue package that steadied Russian financial markets, signs that the crisis is set to spur consolidation and a slew of bankruptcies emerged. Yesterday, a billionaire businessman bought a 50-per-cent stake in one of Russia's largest investment banks in what he said was a sign of things to come.
Metals magnate Mikhail Prokhorov paid $500-million for new equity equal to a 50-per-cent stake in Renaissance Capital , the investment-banking business of Moscow-based Renaissance Group . Analysts said Mr. Prokhorov got a bargain, since Renaissance had been estimated to be worth at least several billion dollars before the crisis.
The deal came as the Kremlin announced fresh measures to ease liquidity, suggesting it believes the banking system remains fragile. State-controlled banks have begun to throw lifelines to smaller private rivals that have run into trouble, in some cases with a view to acquiring them. Leading retailers have also begun to change hands or strike emergency refinancing deals. Cellphone retailer OAO Euroset, one of the country's biggest, got a new owner yesterday, while closely held electronics retailer, Eldorado, accepted a loan that its creditor said may be converted into an ownership stake.
"The strongest companies will survive, and others will cease to exist," predicted Mr. Prokhorov, regularly listed as one of Russia's wealthiest individuals. The crisis was a "peak time" for acquisitions, he added, singling out banks, real estate and construction firms as particularly vulnerable.
Mr. Prokhorov and Renaissance Group said they had been discussing the deal for "several months," but that market turmoil last week - when Russian markets suffered their biggest drop in a decade - had "accelerated" the process.
"The rules for investment banking have been totally rewritten," said Stephen Jennings, chief executive of Renaissance Group. He said he was keen to share risk, obtain fresh capital and gain strong local partners. Alexander Pertsovsky, chief executive officer of the banking business, said the freshly refinanced entity would occupy a "unique niche," possibly boasting more capital than any other investment bank in the world because of global restructuring.
The banking sector had already begun to feel the pinch. Last week, the pension-fund arm of energy giant OAO Gazprom agreed to buy brokerage business KIT Finance after it failed to meet some of its obligations. Moody's Investor Services yesterday cut debt ratings for Svyaz-Bank, saying the bank had defaulted on its obligations and that its capital had been "significantly damaged." It added that it understood the bank was in talks with "publicly undisclosed parties with regard to possible mechanisms for further support." A Svyaz-Bank representative declined to comment.
Renaissance's Mr. Jennings said the crisis was spurring "long overdue" consolidation. "Russia doesn't need 900 banks," he said. "It needs about 10 big banks."
Analysts said the crisis might also affect a fierce shareholder conflict at OAO Norilsk Nickel, where two wealthy businessmen are vying for control. The company's share price has fallen so low that it could be a great chance for either of the businessmen to snap up shares at bargain prices. "It could change things tactically," said Steven Dashevsky, head of equities at Unicredit Aton brokerage in Moscow.
Meanwhile, Russian stocks inched higher yesterday after bouncing back on Friday after a week of heavy losses. The ruble-denominated MICEX exchange finished 0.62-per-cent higher, while the U.S.-dollar-denominated RTS exchange was up 1.05 per cent.
Analysts said markets would likely start making solid gains only when the situation in the U.S. became more stable. "Russia cannot detach itself from the global economy," Mr. Dashevsky said.
Last week, the government assembled a rescue package valued at $120-billion to shore up the banking system. Yesterday, it offered greater relief, suggesting that liquidity levels haven't been fully restored. The government extended a deadline for value-added-tax payments by three months to ease liquidity. Prime Minister Vladimir Putin ordered the Finance Ministry to consider raising the size of bank deposits covered by government guarantees.
Mr. Putin told a cabinet meeting that the Kremlin's anti-crisis measures were working. "The market situation has stabilized," he said.

Abstract: Three decades ago, when oil and gas revenue started pouring into the region, Sheik Rashid, Dubai's far-seeing ruler, realized that his emirate's energy supplies were limited. So, he focused his attention on spinoff activities that would service the resources sector, as well as other commercial enterprises, such as real estate, the construction industry, financial services and tourism.

Full text: Dubai, the glamorous city-in-progress in the United Arab Emirates, is frantically building up its infrastructure to secure its future.
Three decades ago, when oil and gas revenue started pouring into the region, Sheik Rashid, Dubai's far-seeing ruler, realized that his emirate's energy supplies were limited. So, he focused his attention on spinoff activities that would service the resources sector, as well as other commercial enterprises, such as real estate, the construction industry, financial services and tourism.
His vision was to turn his tiny, 4,114-square-kilometre desert state into a Middle Eastern centre for investors, property developers and hotel companies, a goal continued by his son, the current ruler, Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum.
To keep the gravy train rolling, Sheik Mohammed's government has made it easy for foreign companies to do business there, with a variety of tax breaks, duty-free zones and an army of cheap Asian labour.
Dubai has only 70 kilometres of natural coastline but that hasn't deterred development. Nakheel Corp. (nakheel.com) is building islands (the Waterfront, the Palms, the World and the Universe) to create more oceanfront land for real estate development.
Dubai does not levy personal income tax, corporate taxes or capital gains tax. A number of industrial parks in Dubai are free-trade zones, where companies pay no import duty.
In March, 2006, the Dubai government passed a property law allowing foreigners to buy and sell property (freehold or with a 99-year-lease) in certain designated areas and, in 2007, it set up the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA), a division of the Dubai Land Department.
Foreign companies wanting to set up shop need a Dubai Professional Licence (a type of incorporation) and a local UAE sponsor. The Consulate of Canada (dubai@international.gc.ca/telephone: 011 971-4-314-5555) can help with key contacts.
The Big 5 is an annual trade show for the construction industry around the Persian Gulf. In 2007, it attracted 50,420 attendees from the private and public sectors. This year's event will run from Nov. 23-27 at the Dubai International Exhibition Centre (www.thebig5exhibition.com).

Full text: Why pay for a New York hotel when you can stay in a fabulous loft for less? Tim McKeough checks out a new web booking service and finds a deal
The next time you're looking for an affordable place to stay in New York, Chicago or Toronto, you might want to avoid hotels. Thanks to a new website, you could find yourself living like a city resident with a really nice apartment - for a small fraction of the cost of a hotel room.
With Roomorama.com, you can now rent rooms or whole apartments directly from the locals. Its New York service has been running since July. The service has recently come online in Toronto, Boston and Chicago as well, and it's part of a growing trend in "peer-to-peer" sites that provide short-term rental service.
Roomorama's co-founders, Jia En Teo and Federico Folcia, are both avid travellers, and they realized the most expensive part of their trips was usually accommodation. "On the flipside, I was renting my place out through Craigslist and other classifieds," Teo says. "But I ran into lots of frustrations" - such as waiting for renters who never showed up.
While there were other websites offering rural vacation homes for short-term stays, Teo and Folcia had trouble finding short-term rentals in cities.
There was Craigslist, of course, but the listings usually didn't provide enough detail about apartments, nor allow for feedback from previous renters about whether advertisers were trustworthy.
The two sensed an opportunity, and after recruiting a programmer friend, they quit their jobs at Bloomberg and launched Roomorama. Along with sites like airbedandbreakfast.com, it's among the first to address this niche so specifically. And the New York service is doing good business so far; earlier this week, it listed 115 rooms for rent.
For travellers, the process begins with a simple search. Enter the city, dates and desired rental type (a room in a shared apartment, a full apartment or a house), and you're presented with a list of available options - each with a detailed description, map, photographs and feedback from previous guests. "It's just like eBay in that everyone gets a reputation score," Teo says. "We want it to be a community-driven model."
You pay online when you make your booking (some rentals also require a deposit), and Roomorama gives you a four-digit payment code. Upon an acceptable check-in, you hand over the code to your hosts so they can access the payment.
The model is intelligent and easy to use, but it isn't for the faint of heart. There will undoubtedly be surprises when renting from strangers, both good and bad.
But if you're willing to take the risk, you could be handsomely rewarded.
For instance, when I stopped by one of the available rooms in Brooklyn, I was welcomed by Robert (Toshi) Chan, an actor (and part-time real-estate developer) who played the triad boss in The Departed .
But even more impressive than his resumé was his home - a pristine, sun-drenched loft with access to a garden (with private waterfall) out back.
Up the spiral staircase to the room available for rent and things only got better: a wall of windows, a spa-like en-suite bathroom, a flat-screen TV and more space than many Manhattan apartments. The immaculate room even included a mini-bar.
The biggest surprise? Toshi was charging only $189 a night.
If you were to rent out your own home while staying at Toshi's place, you could possibly even come out ahead.

Abstract: That "opportunity" was the beginnings of Cadillac Fairview. Jack Kaiman, owner of Camesco Lighting Ltd., had business expertise and money. Joe Berman, also from an immigrant family and an engineer (with a degree from U of T) had become friends with Mr. Diamond in the navy when they were both posted to St. John's in 1944. He worked for Mr. Kaiman and had access to some family money. Mr. Diamond had no money and no financial assets other than a heavily mortgaged $14,000 house.

Full text: As a CEO who ran one of North America's biggest real-estate enterprises, he was an electrical engineer who capitalized on the post-war building boom and then helped to change the face of urban Canada
Real-estate czar Eph Diamond was the antithesis of the cartoon image of a rapacious, ruthless, ostentatious developer, dripping in gold jewellery and smoking a stogie - except for the cigar part - especially in his younger years. A co-founder of Cadillac-Fairview, once one of the largest real-estate empires in North America, he was a key player behind Erin Mills, the Toronto-Dominion Centre, The Eaton Centre, Yorkdale Shopping Centre, Vancouver's Pacific Centre and dozens of other apartment and office complexes and shopping malls in Canada and the United States.
A smart boy from a poor immigrant family, he made millions transforming the postwar urban and suburban landscape. And yet, he lived a modest family-centred life according to a simple code: Honesty reaps more than its own reward. "If scoundrels were aware of the benefits of being honest, they would be honest out of pure rascality," was one of his trademark comments.
"Eph was one of those rare developers who cared about life's elegances and decencies, outside the bottom line. He was one of a kind - and had a sense of humour to boot," said writer Peter Newman, an archeologist of the Canadian business elite in books such as The Canadian Establishment and The Bronfman Dynasty .
"Eph Diamond was one of the finest people I ever met in my life," said Tom Kierans, a senior corporate director and a shrewd and tough observer of human nature and economic activity. "Integrity ... He reeked of it."
John (Jack) Daniels, who became a partner in Cadillac in the very early 1960s, said: "You couldn't wish for a finer human being. We spent more time together running the company than we did with our wives. I was the outside man and he was the inside man," said Mr. Daniels, explaining that he brought in new projects and Mr. Diamond ran the company.
"I knew him because in my former life [politics] the development industry was very interested in the economic growth of the province," said former Ontario premier Bill Davis. "He represented the best of the development industry ... and was one of the finest, most decent individuals that I met during my time in public life. He was the real spirit of Cadillac Fairview and I think I could safely say he was highly regarded by his contemporaries in the industry."
Business was far from Mr. Diamond's only preoccupation. "Almost from the inception of him working for Cadillac in 1953, I think he always felt a sense of community," said his son, Stephen Diamond. Although not a religious man, Mr. Diamond was heavily involved in the founding and building of Temple Sinai, a synagogue in North Toronto, because he wanted his sons to have an opportunity to learn about their religious and cultural tradition, according to Rabbi Michael Dolgin.
The rabbi described a rancorous meeting to elect the first president of the temple. "When there were some hard feelings, Eph got up and made a speech about how even the people who didn't get the votes needed to be treated with respect and welcomed as part of the community. People were so taken with what he had to say and how he said it, that when the person who had been running for president [and had lost] refused to be vice-president, they all nominated Eph," said Mr. Dolgin. Mr. Diamond became the second president of the temple and was a key player in building the synagogue. "He did business well because he didn't just do business. He saw what was right and talked regularly with his sons and others about the benefits of doing things in the honest, right way."
Allen Ephraim Diamond was born in Montreal after the First World War, the second of four children of Latvian immigrant and shoemaker Meyer Diamond and his wife, Alice (Chowsky). Times were tough, so the Diamonds moved to Brockville around 1925 because they thought a smaller town might offer better prospects. They left Eph, who was then four or five, with his grandparents in Montreal so that he could continue to attend the local yeshiva. When he was somewhere between 10 and bar-mitzvah age, he joined his parents and siblings in Brockville, where he attended local schools and, as a teenager, worked part-time in a store to help with family finances.
When Eph came home one day and told his parents that his boss had offered him a full-time job, his proud mother saw a rosy future for her son. At dinner, she suggested that Eph might one day aspire to the position of store manager, if he quit school and grabbed this opportunity. But his father had other ideas. Rattling his plate in anger, according to some versions of the oft-told tale, he roared: "And if he becomes a store manager, what is that?" Instead, the boy stayed in school and his father borrowed against a life-insurance policy, money that Eph combined with his summer earnings, to pay for tuition and board at Queen's University in Kingston, Ont. He studied electrical engineering and graduated cum laude with a bachelor of science in 1943.
He immediately enlisted in the Royal Canadian Navy, serving as a radar officer for the next three years - despite being chronically seasick - at postings in Newfoundland and Bermuda. On leave in August, 1945, he met Shirley Greenberg, a young woman from St. Catharines, Ont., who was holidaying with a couple of girl friends. He was immediately smitten, but she found him a bit too serious and stood him up on the last day. "It was the smartest thing I ever did," Mrs. Diamond said, "because he never forgot me." About a year later, after having been discharged from with the rank of lieutenant, he moved to Toronto and invited her to a Queen's versus University of Toronto football game and dance.
"I was a small-town girl and that sounded pretty nice to me," she said in an interview. More attracted by the occasion, than Mr. Diamond, she went looking for a good time and found "the person I knew I wanted to spend more time with," she said. "After that, I chased him until he caught me." Following a very rapid courtship - they lived in different cities - they married the day after her 21st birthday on Sept. 15, 1946. Eventually, they had four sons: Michael, Stephen, Carey and Mark.
After leaving the navy, Mr. Diamond was offered a job teaching engineering at a university in the Maritimes but turned it down because, as he liked to say, he had already met Ms. Greenberg. Instead, he got a job in construction as a project engineer at Principal Investments.
There had been almost no housing built during the war because most economic, construction and manufacturing activities were concentrated on the war effort, so when peace came, there was an enormous need for new housing stock and shopping facilities for returning veterans eager to start families and enjoy life after the horrors and deprivations of the previous six years. "He was the best friend of my brother-in-law Abe Berlin," said Avie Bennett, whose family owned Principal, explaining that the two men had been classmates at Queen's and then had joined the navy together. Mr. Diamond was put in charge of construction of Sunnybrook Plaza at Bayview and Eglinton - the first shopping centre in Toronto. After that success, Mr. Diamond was asked to supervise the construction of Lawrence Plaza, a much larger development.
After seven years with Principal Investments, he quit to go into business with two partners. Saying that his family had the "highest, highest" regard for Mr. Diamond, because he was "intelligent, industrious and very capable," Mr. Bennett added: "We were sorry to see him go, but happy that he had an opportunity to improve himself. I never met anybody who didn't like him."
That "opportunity" was the beginnings of Cadillac Fairview. Jack Kaiman, owner of Camesco Lighting Ltd., had business expertise and money. Joe Berman, also from an immigrant family and an engineer (with a degree from U of T) had become friends with Mr. Diamond in the navy when they were both posted to St. John's in 1944. He worked for Mr. Kaiman and had access to some family money. Mr. Diamond had no money and no financial assets other than a heavily mortgaged $14,000 house. However, he had construction experience. Specifically, he knew how to take a vacant piece of land, equip it with electricity and other services and put up houses and apartments. Mr. Kaiman knew Mr. Diamond as a customer who bought fixtures from him for his construction projects at Principal. When Mr. Diamond went to Camesco to buy fixtures for his own house, he insisted on paying in cash, despite Mr. Kaiman's offers to cut him a deal in return for all the business that Mr. Diamond had sent his way. "I thought, there's a guy I want to go into business with," Mr. Kaiman said later, explaining why he offered to lend Mr. Diamond $40,000 to invest in the company.
The three would-be partners met in Eddie Goodman's law office on Queen Street West to iron out the particulars and then repaired to the Town Tavern for a round or two of Cokes and more talk. "Picture four short guys who looked like construction workers in fancy clothes, guys whose collective idea of haute cuisine was corned beef on rye," is the way the editors of Canadian Business described them in Guts, Greed and Glory: A Visual History of Modern Canadian Business. The plan was to build apartments, use the rent for cash flow while building houses and then turn the profits back into the company to build equity in the apartment buildings. From the beginning, they adhered to the philosophy that if a property was enticing enough to build, it was good enough to keep. The word "flip" was not part of their lexicon.
What to call the new company was solved when the four men walked to Mr. Kaiman's car, looked at his 1951 navy-blue Cadillac sedan, and experienced the mental equivalent of switching on a light bulb. Of course, Mr. Goodman, the lawyer, pointed out the obvious - that General Motors might object - but they could not be dissuaded from naming their baby company Cadillac Contracting and Developments Ltd. and using a stylized drawing of a Cadillac as their first corporate logo. Mr. Diamond was president and chief-executive officer.
Six years later, the company had grown so exponentially that Mr. Diamond formed Whitecastle Investments Ltd. as a holding company for his own family.
From the early years, Cadillac was an integrated development company, with its own planners and labour force and separate divisions for residential, office buildings and shopping centres. This was especially true after the firm started working with CEMP Investments, the holding company for the children of Seagram's controlling shareholder, Samuel Bronfman, and had become involved in joint ventures with other real estate interests, including apartment developer John (Jack) Daniels.
By 1960, Cadillac was no longer a start-up company, and that took a lot of the fun out of it for Mr. Kaiman, one of the founding partners. He dropped out, selling his one-third interest to Mr. Daniels. Another partner, chartered accountant Gerald (Gerry) Shear, joined shortly thereafter. Under Mr. Diamond's shrewd direction, the company, which was reorganized as Cadillac Development Corporation Ltd. on Jan 1, 1964, acquired a large interest in Canadian Equity and Development Ltd., and its subsidiary, Don Mills Developments Ltd., from E. P. Taylor's massive real-estate holdings in Erin Mills and Mississauga. They formed a joint venture with CEMP to develop subdivisions. Four years later, Cadillac went public.
The company was land-rich and relatively cash-poor, so in 1974 Mr. Diamond began negotiating with Leo Kolber to merge with Fairview, a subsidiary of the Bronfman-owned CEMP Investments. By the time the deal was completed in 1976, the new conglomerate, Cadillac Fairview, comprised Cadillac Development, Fairview and Canadian Equity and Development. The Bronfman family was in control (with 35 per cent), but Mr. Diamond was the ultimate manager as president and CEO until he retired from running the company in 1979. He remained on the executive committee of the board of directors until the company was sold by the Bronfmans in 1987 to the JMB Realty Corp., a group of U.S. pension funds. The company was bought by the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan in 2000.
Meanwhile, Mr. Diamond had become more actively involved in Whitecastle, the family holding company, taking on the role of president and investing in real estate and private companies both on his own and in joint ventures with other investors. In 1989, he semi-retired, spending close to half the year in Florida with his wife. By then his third son, Carey Diamond, had joined Whitecastle and the firm had begun its transition away from real estate and into investing in emerging private companies. In the late 1990s, the elder Mr. Diamond became chairman and Carey Diamond assumed the roles of president and CEO of Whitecastle Investments. Further changes occurred in 2005 when they launched Whitecastle Private Equity Partners, a buyout fund with Eph Diamond as a member of the advisory board. Earlier this year they went back into real estate with the creation of New Urban Fund, a development fund managed by son number two, lawyer Stephen Diamond, again with Eph Diamond on the advisory board.
Mr. Diamond had one of his few management and negotiating failures when his friend Lotfi Mansouri, then general director of the Canadian Opera Company, persuaded him to become the founding chair of the Ballet Opera House Corporation in 1976. After a decade of frustration, he resigned in 1986, the year after David Peterson became premier of a Liberal minority government. Mr. Peterson questioned both the economics of the project and the choice of the site at Bay and Wellesley Streets in Toronto, a parcel of land had been promised to the Ballet Opera House Corp. in a letter written to Mr. Diamond by Mr. Davis early in 1985, just before he resigned as premier. Mr. Davis said, "I think if I had stayed as premier for another four-year term, and if those involved had come forward with something that was economically manageable, that site [which he still considers the best choice] might have been developed." The opera house, or more accurately, The Four Seasons Centre for the Performing Arts, was finally opened in 2006 -after what was often called "the 30 years war" - with a different architect, a different general director of the COC and a different site, and without the participation of the National Ballet Company.
Mr. Diamond also sat on the boards of Ontario Hydro, Mount Sinai Hospital, Baycrest Centre for Geriatric Care and several other organizations. A major player in the Canadian Friends for the Hebrew University, he set up a bursary fund that is awarded equally to Arab and Jewish Israelis. His last philanthropy was to raise money for Save a Child's Heart, an organization that brings children with heart problems, and their families, from African and Arab countries to Israel for corrective surgery. "It was a typical example of his philosophy," said Carey Diamond, that he would try to save children's lives, but in doing so it "was his hope" that it would promote "a greater understanding between people" by having the families meet and talk with each other.
In 1978, Mr. Diamond had a health scare when he developed problems in his carotid artery, presaging a potential stroke. He had preventive surgery to repair the artery in the early eighties and then a quadruple bypass several years later. While still active in Whitecastle, he was spending a great deal more time with his children and grandchildren, a retirement that was cut short when the graft on his carotid artery gave way, less than two weeks before the Diamonds were due to celebrate their 52nd wedding anniversary.

Full text: It may yet turn out to be Tony Ianno's last laugh.
Mr. Ianno, the four-time Liberal MP for Trinity-Spadina who beat the NDP's Olivia Chow in 1997 and again in 2004 before losing to her in 2006, always insisted that he would be back for yet another rematch.
But on the eve of the election call, Mr. Ianno says, he had a change of heart.
After spending more than a decade in Ottawa, away from his wife and children, he suddenly realized how much he was enjoying private life.
"I go to my kids' soccer games, and I just sit there," he says to his own astonishment - no double-booked agenda, no buzzing BlackBerry, no plane to catch back to Ottawa. And so, at the very last minute, Mr. Ianno decided to step aside, finally putting an end to the bitter, nasty Ianno-Chow feud.
It's a nice story; it may even be true. There's only one reason to doubt his sincerity: The candidate running in his place is as strategically shrewd a choice as any the Liberals could have made. Her name is Christine Innes, an Annex lawyer and mother of four, active in the community, and a lifelong Liberal volunteer. She also managed all of Mr. Ianno's campaigns.
And she happens to be his wife.
Ms. Innes's candidacy has made the campaign more civil, at least on the surface.
Ms. Chow applauds her opponent's decision to run. "It's not an easy decision to make, especially with four children," she says. "But when she says, 'It's my time' " - the words Ms. Innes used when she kicked off her campaign on Sept. 5 - "I certainly know that feeling."
Beneath the veneer, however, Ms. Chow also knows that, in one of the city's most competitive races, Ms. Innes will have the backing of Mr. Ianno's formidable election machine: a canvassing operation that can blanket the riding within two weeks, and a database built and refined over six campaigns, assigning each voter a bar code to better track address changes. "Tony has never lent his machine to anybody, and nobody else would have gotten it," says a Liberal insider.
"Anyway, it's her machine as much as his. A lot of people were really working for Christine, not Tony."
Incumbents always have an edge in any campaign, and that remains true here. Ms. Chow has a formidable machine of her own, and Ms. Innes, though beloved by local Liberals, can't match Ms. Chow's name recognition in every corner of the riding.
But there's another factor at play: Trinity-Spadina, long the archetypal Toronto riding with its mix of white- and blue-collar workers and its Portuguese, Italian and Chinese communities, has been radically transformed by the real-estate boom.
Resale prices have surged, particularly in the Annex but also throughout the riding. Census data show that average home values here have increased from $292,519 in 2001 to $408,585 in 2006, a 40-per-cent increase that has spurred many long-time residents to cash in and give way to young, affluent urban families.
And the rash of condominiums to the south, near the waterfront, are packed with new voters - young professionals with no attachment to any of the area's long-time local representatives, and no party affiliation. Traditional power bases are eroding as the riding gets younger and richer.
Trinity-Spadina no longer eats lasagna and spends its evenings on the front porch; it goes to the gym after work and eats vegetarian. This ain't your nonna's neighbourhood.
On one morning this week, the residents of the condominium tower at 18 Yonge St. streamed out the doors and turned north, walking beneath the railway tracks on their way to work downtown. There is a uniformity to them. They are young. They are nattily dressed in business attire: slim suits and ties for the men, knee-length skirts and heels for the women. They have sunglasses, iPods and BlackBerrys. They are diverse in skin colour, including people from South Asia and the Middle East, though they also sport the standard uniforms and accessories. And they are politically unaffiliated.
"I might vote Green," says Greg, a twentysomething resident who works in financial services. Greg says he is also considering the Liberals, and that he "probably won't vote NDP."
Syma, a law clerk in her early 30s, voted Liberal last time around, "but I'm not sure this time. I thought [Stephen] Harper was doing a good job. And Jack Layton has been running a good campaign. I might vote for either one."
These voters aren't merely undecided - they're wild cards, failing to occupy a reliable spot on the traditional left-right spectrum. And there's more than enough to swing the seat back into the Liberal fold.
The numbers are eye-popping. According to Jane Renwick, vice-president of the real-estate research firm Urbanation, since the last election in 2006, a total of 33 new condo towers have been completed in Trinity-Spadina, for a total of 8,888 new units.
"And we're not talking south Florida here," Ms. Renwick says, referring to that region's rash of fully built, utterly empty condo towers. "These units are selling, they are closing and people are moving in."
Using the industry standard of 1.2 residents per unit, Ms. Renwick calculates a total of 10,666 new residents. Ms. Innes's campaign has been assuming an average of 1.8 residents per unit, which totals nearly 15,998 new residents, though she expects an even higher tally.
Whatever the actual number turns out to be, it will dwarf the riding's typical margin of victory.
Last time around, Ms. Chow prevailed by 3,861 votes. In 2004, Mr. Ianno beat Ms. Chow in a squeaker: 805 votes.
These newcomers are only accelerating the trends captured by the most recent census data. From 2001 to 2006 the riding's population increased by 9,275 people.
They are nearly all single: the number of residents who have never been legally married rose by 8,690. All age groups increased in numbers, but those that increased most were between the ages of 20 and 45, with the fastest rise coming among women aged 20 to 29. And while visible minorities still make up more than a third of the riding's population, the number of residents who speak neither English nor French is actually going down, as is the number of immigrants in the riding - signs that, though the riding isn't actually getting whiter, it's getting more culturally homogeneous.
But while the wild cards could swing the riding back to the Liberals, it's far from a sure thing. "You might think that the increasing affluence and the rise in home ownership would push the riding to the right," says Alan Walks, a professor of geography with the University of Toronto's Centre for Urban and Community Studies, "but that's not necessarily true. The decline of the Italian and Portuguese communities may have contributed to the Liberal defeat last time."
For every new voter who works in a big bank or law firm, Prof. Walks says, there is another who works in the so-called creative class - TV producers, journalists and the like - and it's hard to generalize how any of them will vote. In consumer terms, these gadget-addled condo dwellers are often called "early adopters," and Prof. Walks thinks that the label might prove true in politics as well. "It will be interesting to see how the emergence of the Green Party plays out down there," he says.
Given that the wild cards could decide the outcome, Ms. Chow has already honed her message to them. "A lot of them are paying off their student debt," she says, "and they need help." She also makes an appeal to their cavalier side: "This country needs to do something bold," she says, casting the Liberals as middle-of-the-road blandness.
Ms. Innes focuses her pitch on the economy. "A lot of young professionals arrive here from across Canada," she says. "They have more of a national perspective on the issues." Now if only any candidate could get their message through. Canvassing is forbidden in most condo developments, keeping these voters out of easy grasp of the traditional campaign machines.

Full text: At the new Sobeys store at Yonge and Balliol, the lunch crowd pays for its gourmet-to-go meals beneath a crystal chandelier sparkling above the cash register.
In their carts are organic peanut butter and Baratti & Milano chocolate, antibiotic-free meat and brandied marmalade by Compliments Sensations, the high-end in-house brand. It's Pusateri's-style products priced for the masses.
With the opening of the Balliol location in June, Sobeys now has 15 stores in Toronto, up from three in 1998. Five downtown locations have opened in the past 12 months alone, often in offbeat locations, such as the former Blockbuster Video store in the Annex. As the green-bannered label pops up all over town, some residents see themselves as the winners in the battle of the grocery stores.
"With Sobeys coming into the neighbourhood, there's now better prices," a woman named Sandra said as she shopped at the new Sobeys at Front and Princess, a converted Canada Post warehouse. "The Rabba and the Dominion next door have had to give the consumer better prices because of the competition."
Sobeys also is distinguishing itself by customizing its stores to suit Toronto's particular neighbourhoods. In North York, for instance, at the Clark and Hilda streets store, Sobeys holds the distinction of being North America's biggest kosher supermarket, with a rabbi on staff. At the much larger flagship Queensway Sobeys location, close to neighbourhoods stocked with Eastern European-style delis, the draw is imported cheese. There are more than 200 varieties.
"They seem to have stepped into a vacuum that the other traditional grocery stores haven't considered," says Toronto real-estate analyst Barry Lyon, of N. Barry Lyon Consulting Ltd.
The Balliol location is an example of the new wave.
At 8,000 square feet, it's boutique-sized, with only 10 parking spots. Designed for a neighbourhood filled with apartment buildings, its aisles are narrow and the tiered shelving is deep as a jeweller's.
One-litre milk cartons trump four-litre bags. Even the grocery carts - think Smart cars instead of SUVs - are smaller. The in-house food magazine, Inspired, appeals to sophisticated foodies, as do visits by local chefs such as Massimo Capra and David Agee. Mr. Lyon thinks Sobeys could own the downtown, because it understands the downtown shopper, who is often single and looking for prepared foods and takeout. "At Sobeys, the stores are smaller, and people shop three, four, five times a week, sometimes daily, to walk their groceries home," he says. Whereas in the older suburban model, such as "the Loblaws at Queens Quay and Jarvis, is where everyone drives and fills their car up once a week."
Rodney Lock is a case in point. "I'm a cook," Mr. Lock says, perusing the prepared-foods section inside the Sobeys at Front and Princess. "But sometimes late at night the last thing I want to do is prepare dinner.
"Sobeys has prepared pizza, and if I buy a few extras, like sausage and feta cheese, I get a feeling of a fresh product that I could have made myself," he says. "It's a lot better than Pizza Pizza."
Sobeys has been innovative in its presentation, rebranding the new stores with the hipper moniker "Urban Fresh," locating in underused properties and freshening up those older spaces with "designer" interiors (Italian lighting, custom wood-and-glass cabinets, granite-topped takeout counters, lime-green and black decor) - and structuring displays to make maximum use of smaller space.
"There's more produce on offer at Balliol than at the bigger Leaside store," says Mary Dalimonte, general manager of the Urban Fresh service format team.
"And that's because we've built up. We can offer lychee nuts, kumquats, dragon fruit, guavas, gooseberries, product that some of the other locations don't have, because we have been mindful of how we use our store space." Sobeys is "classing it up," says a shopper calling herself Anne.
The Sobeys invasion into Toronto continues into next year, with firm plans for locations at Bremner and Spadina and at One Cole, the new condo being built as part of the Regent Park redevelopment.
Other locations are being scouted.
"We know that to take the market share we have to first take Toronto," says Craig Gilpin, president of operation for Sobeys Ontario. "Forty per cent of Canada lives in Ontario; 40 per cent of Ontario lives in Toronto. It stands to reason.
"We are very competitive people," Mr. Gilpin continues. "We are serious about food. ... You won't find a golf ball in these aisles," he adds with a knowing smile.
As condos bloom and Toronto infill becomes the modern reality, Mr. Lyons says, "the suburban model [of a grocery store] - and, by that, I mean Loblaws - doesn't work downtown any more."

Metro rebranding
Goodbye, Dominion and A & P. These supermarkets will henceforth be known as Metro. The Montreal-based Metro Inc. is rebranding its grocery stores under a single banner, to be unveiled Thursday, at the Dominion at Bayview and Eglinton (A & P doesn't flip over to the Metro moniker until next year).

Full text: Wall Street, Bay Street, Main Street: One leads to another in an interconnected network, with no off-ramps available for the relief of motion sickness. Despite assurances from several Canadian bankers that their firms have little "exposure" to the current pile-up in Lower Manhattan, everybody is braced for the inevitable rear-ending. It's the way of the street.
Have you noticed Bay Street lately? There is a handsome new skyscraper rising at the intersection of Adelaide Street, where for more than a decade an unfinished concrete elevator core stood as grim witness to the last great blowout.
The official word this week, with the TSX down about 20 per cent since its peak only three months ago, is that we're all right, Jack. Good fundamentals and all. But when Bay Street is your Main Street, there's always reason to worry.
The nakedly obvious chain of causation in this disaster, beginning with an overheated market in residential real estate and culminating (so far) with a financial-services meltdown, cannot fail to impress all those who shop at Pusateri's - not to mention their many economic dependants.
Like it or not, Ma and Pa Toronto are uncomfortably connected to an ugly reality. Even if they have nothing more than a pension plan, they're already losers. On average, though, people who live in Toronto are twice as likely as other Canadians to have a direct stake in the financial-services industry or one of its kissing cousins, according to the 2006 census.
What's good for Bay Street is good for us - likewise, what's bad.
In the wake of the Wall Street carnage, the local office of real estate firm Colliers International forecast a "bumpy road ahead" for the Bay Street office market, predicting lower rents and rising vacancy rates through 2009 and beyond.
But everybody knew that was coming, with three new towers in the financial district soon opening their doors to tenants. It's the logical result of yesterday's good-news story: the revival of the core from a near-20-year coma.
What of tomorrow? The situation could worsen, according to Ian MacCulloch, Colliers vice-president of research, "as the collateral damage adds up, some of which we have seen coming and some not." But he ruled out the chance of the latest binge ending with another unfinished stump - and all that means for the local, indeed regional, economy.
The towers under construction are "substantially pre-leased" to solvent tenants, he said, and the developers in this cycle are not high-stakes gamblers but pension funds. "They're not worried about making their mortgage payments."
Suddenly, it seems, borders really do matter in global financial markets. The Wall Street rout will have minimal impact on Bay Street, according to Steven Sorensen, chairman of the Toronto Office Coalition.
"Our financial industry has built a foundation that has withstood the storm," said Janet Ecker, president of the Toronto Financial Services Alliance and former provincial finance minister.
Even Prime Minister Stephen Harper is comfortably assuring about the future of Bay Street, citadel of prudence and rectitude.
But maybe what all the same voices said yesterday about globalization really is true, and our comfortable insularity is just temporary dissonance. When senior economists begin using phrases like "predatory implosion" and "state of panic," the man on Main Street grits his teeth and gets ready for what's coming.

Full text: In a tough real estate market, a Dallas couple manage to sell their home and keep their marriage intact
When we put our Dallas house on the market for $490,000 (U.S.) in February, we thought it would sell in weeks with little discounting.
Talk about being delusional.
We ended up lowering the price five times before the house finally sold last month. We didn't get our first offer until late June, and it was $102,000 below where we had started.
All the uncertainty made us delay buying a new home near New York City, and we've been scrambling to find a place before the school year starts. During my 28 years as a journalist, I've moved 11 times for my job. This was in some ways the hardest one.
The whole experience made me a tiny part of a huge story - the collapse in housing prices - affecting millions of Americans. It was humbling for me, your typical know-it-all reporter, to find myself caught up in a situation where I had no ready answers.
In previous columns, I have waxed about my penny-pinching approach on everything from restaurant meals to vacations to buying new books. But all that pales in comparison to the stakes during a home sale. In our case, we needed to extract as much money as possible from our Dallas home so we could afford the higher prices in the Northeast.
My wife, Clarissa, and I were on the same page for some decisions. But we quarrelled early on about how much to spend fixing up the house - and later on how quickly to chop the price when it wouldn't sell.
Whereas Clarissa has always been the generous one, and I was the one who sweats every last dollar, she wanted to hold out for a higher price, convinced the house was worth it. I became haunted by the belief that the market was tanking, and that we needed to get our price down as quickly as possible and get the house sold now.
Our odyssey began last fall when The Wall Street Journal named me its personal finance editor, a New York-based job. For the previous three-plus years, I had been its Dallas bureau chief. The plan was that I would move the family to northern New Jersey in June when the school year ended.
It soon became clear that Clarissa and I had different visions for getting the house ready for sale. I simply wanted to paint it and correct obvious defects, such as exterior wood that rotted during heavy rains last year. Clarissa wanted to redo the kitchen, install new fixtures in at least one of the bathrooms and much, much more. I fretted we wouldn't get that money back when we sold.
So we compromised. We spent $2,000 putting granite countertops and a new sink in the kitchen, and we merely painted the bathrooms.
But Clarissa didn't stop there. She paid a carpenter to put inlaid patterns on the wooden mantle. She spent hundreds on plants. She put in new lighting fixtures and new curtains and replaced a tattered awning.
Periodically, l would try to get her to slow down the spending, and she would tell me to buzz off. I was the one forcing the family to move yet again, and this time she was going to do the things to get top dollar for her house so she could afford a decent one in New Jersey.
We had paid about $360,000 for the house in 2004. Now, with all the things we'd fixed or improved over the years, I figured our total investment was more like $390,000.
We had reason to believe we could come out way ahead. Our 1937 brick-and-stone house sat in a pretty neighbourhood of older homes and towering trees about eight kilometres from downtown Dallas. The city's real estate market had remained relatively strong, and we lived in one of the strongest submarkets.
Based on selling prices the previous fall, our agent, Gia Marshello of the local Coldwell Banker office, predicted our three-bedroom house would fetch $485,000. We put the asking price at $490,000, and waited for the buyers to line up. They didn't.
After a month, only 10 had visited our house, and I was beginning to panic. We had planned a March home-buying trip to New Jersey, but I put it on hold - indefinitely.
Gia suggested that we discount the house by $10,000 or perhaps $15,000. I pushed for the bigger discount. Clarissa reluctantly agreed, even though she saw comparable houses priced the same or higher in our neighbourhood. The problem was that they weren't selling either.
The feedback from people visiting our house was worrisome. Too many said the layout didn't work for them. Our house had two bedrooms and one bathroom upstairs, and one bedroom and one bathroom downstairs. Parents with small children wanted all the bedrooms on one floor.
A couple of buyers complained the kitchen wasn't open enough. I sputtered to Gia: "This is a 1937 house - they didn't make open kitchens back then. We're not getting the right buyers."
At one point, Gia left me a voicemail on the latest developments. She sent out postcards about our house to everyone in the neighbourhood and buried a statue of St. Joseph (the patron of carpentry) in our yard, which some believe brings good luck to home sellers. "Oh my gosh," I thought to myself. "This is our marketing plan?"
As the months stretched on, we kept lowering our price, first to $469,000, then to $455,000, then to $448,000 with another $4,000 in "credits." We thought we had a buyer with that last price. A young woman made three visits to the home and told us to let her know if any other offers came in. But her father was paying for the home, and he didn't like the house, and that was that.
Gia left no stone unturned to sell our house. She held open house after open house. Each time we lowered our price, she would contact anyone who had expressed interest in the house. Nothing worked.
I talked to a real estate agent friend of mine in New Jersey, and he advised us to cut the house to its bare-bones price. "If only three houses sell in your neighbourhood, you've got to make sure you're one of the three homes," he told me.
Gia advised the same. Clarissa finally caved in, and we priced the home on a Monday afternoon in late June at $429,900, putting it thousands of dollars below most comparable houses in our neighbourhood. Almost immediately, buyers flocked to check it out. Gia got word an offer was coming. On Thursday, she called me. The offer was for $388,000 - more than $40,000 below our last asking price.
How could this be, we asked ourselves. We just made this the best bargain in the neighbourhood, and now this guy wants another 40 grand off. Clarissa wanted to reject the offer, but I felt we had to make it work. After all, we'd had the house on the market for more than four months, and this was our first offer.
There was no guarantee there'd be another one.
So we exchanged a series of offers and counteroffers with the buyer. It was like pulling teeth. After three days, he offered $399,310.
Clarissa found this insulting and wanted to counter with $412,666 to send a message. "I don't think that's a good idea," I told her.
Finally, on Monday, the buyer raised his offer to $409,000. I got him up to $410,000, and I was resigned to sign a contract later that day. Clarissa, who had to sign off on any deal, was convinced that would be a big mistake and we ought to wait for another buyer. She called Gia to say, "Don't let him give away the house."
While all this was playing out, a new offer rolled in that afternoon from another buyer.
"Are you sitting down?" Gia asked me. "They want to offer full price," or $429,900. Gia then went back to the first buyer to say we had a higher offer, in case he wanted to improve his bid. He didn't. We signed the $429,900 contract.
We soon met the buyers, a young couple expecting their first baby. They said they were thrilled to get the house. And they seemed to appreciate the unusual plants Clarissa had picked out and all her touches inside the house. Her strategy had worked after all.
Our selling price amounted to a 12-per-cent discount from our starting price. I don't expect any violins for us. Some regions of California have seen home prices decline more than 30 per cent from their selling prices a year earlier. We got off very lightly by comparison.
Our house went on the market when there were few homes for sale in our neighbourhood. That's no longer true. When I took my last drive through my old neighbourhood, the streets were beginning to bristle with "for sale" and "open house" signs - though many were above our price range. I shudder to think.

Full text: A gleaming new vertical city has sprouted above Toronto's lower-scale buildings. The big question is whether all this condo construction will translate into sustainable economic growth
For Robert Whitfield, the eureka moment occurred when he realized his store was filled with customers trapped between drywall and a hard place.
It happened about four years ago, shortly after he opened an upscale furniture store in Liberty Village, a district of warehouse lofts on the west end of Toronto's downtown. Young couples were streaming into his shop, desperate to furnish new stacked townhouses and condo apartments with minuscule master bedrooms and other "spatial challenges."
"All of 10-by-11," recalls Mr. Whitfield, the principal of Casalife Inc., of one particularly constrained floor plan. "It just didn't have room for a bed and a dresser and a tallboy. Where are you going to put your socks?"
Where indeed? Within months, he had launched a queen bed with drawers cleverly tucked underneath, and a niche market was tapped. Today, Casalife specializes in furniture tailored to the cramped confines of the high-rise condos that proliferate in the city.
Mr. Whitfield now has several competitors and spends much of his time attending international trade shows searching for size-conscious items, such as the elusive 18-inch coffee table. "The reality is that this market is still neglected."
But there's no doubt it's a market. Indeed, Casalife's commercial success is directly attributable to Toronto's sustained condo boom, which traces its origins to some key land-use reforms made in the mid-1990s. A decade later, the market shows little sign of slowing, despite moribund real estate markets in the United States and Britain.
Between 1994 and 2007, the annual dollar value of residential building permits in the City of Toronto jumped more than three-fold, largely on the strength of the condo boom. It's as if a gleaming new vertical city has sprouted amid Toronto's lower-scale buildings.
Between 2001 and 2006, a staggering 17,000 residential units were built downtown, the vast majority of them high-rises. At the end of 2006, another 39,000 units, in 155 projects, were in the pipeline.
The result has been a remarkable 17-per-cent jump in the population of central Toronto - growth not seen since the early 1970s. Nor is the boom a downtown phenomenon: Clusters of condos have cropped up in traditionally low-rise suburban areas such as North York, Scarborough and Mississauga, with more on the way.
And the developments are growing not only in height, but also in scope. Vancouver-based Concord Adex, which is building CityPlace, a sprawling 20-building cluster near the downtown Rogers Centre, is also planning a 15-tower project on a 20-hectare former industrial site near Highway 401. To be built over the next decade, this new project is worth a staggering $2-billion.
The key to this growth, planners and economists says, is the fact that the population of Greater Toronto jumps by about 100,000 every year. All these new residents need housing and increasingly they are choosing high-rise condos.
This rapid transformation is not without its critics, including homeowner groups upset about tall towers and downtown artists who bemoan the loss of Main Street atmosphere in areas targeted by developers.
"Pumping a lot more people into the downtown core hasn't led to balanced growth," says Toronto Councillor Adam Vaughan, whose ward has the highest concentration of condo activity.
Yet even skeptics don't deny that the immediate, local spinoffs are substantial. Condos today represent 50 per cent of all residential development activity in Greater Toronto and 80 per cent in the City of Toronto proper - a trend that puts the region sharply at odds with most North American urban areas.
The direct investment for condos built since 2001, as well as those under development, likely exceeds $20-billion. And housing starts - whether high-rises or subdivisions - have always functioned like economic spark plugs. Between 2002 and 2007, residential construction as a proportion of GDP rose to 6.7 per cent from 5.5 per cent - a shift that has moved in lock-step with job creation, according to housing economist Will Dunning. "That's where it all comes from."
In the GTA, the most direct beneficiaries are construction workers. Mr. Dunning says $1-million of residential construction translates into nine "person-years" of construction employment, as well as another two person-years for consultants, architects and other professionals involved in planning such projects.
The other big winners are the local suppliers of building materials. Although non-residential construction consumes a larger amount of basic materials, residential development represents "a particularly important source of demand for producers of windows and doors, kitchen cabinets, gypsum and wallboard and heating and air conditioning," according to an analysis by Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp.
The wages and purchases of materials for Toronto's 2007's condo projects, in turn, triggered about $175-million in tax revenues. In terms of local taxes, city officials say that between 1996 and 2005), the 69,000 new condos completed in that period contributed about $113-million annually to municipal coffers.
Then there are the secondary spinoffs - the new supermarkets, dry cleaners, convenience stores, coffee shops, houseware and hardware stores that cater to thousands of residents now living near the financial district.
Stephen Dupuis, CEO of the Building Industry and Land Development Association, says the typical new home buyer purchases about $10,000 worth of goods after taking possession. But Mr. Whitfield, of Casalife, suspects the figure could be higher for condo residents, because of the small size of many suites: "They get their occupancy, they move in and then realize their furniture doesn't fit."
Like Casalife, many retail companies are moving to fill the needs of condo dwellers. General Electric Canada's Mabe appliance division recently launched Loft Kitchen, a collection of fashionable, small-scale appliances and stacked washer-driers suited to tiny condo kitchens. Working with developers, GE tailored the collection specifically to this market. "You need to get efficiency and space and hit the prices point," says general brand manager Philippe Meyersohn.
Unlike locally sourced construction materials, however, durable goods and appliances tend to be imported from Asia, Mexico and the United States, illustrating how the condo ripple effect can spread well beyond the GTA.
Planning consultant Barry Lyon also argues that the high-rise office boom in downtown Toronto (200 floors are currently under construction) is linked to the flourishing condo market. "A lot of the office construction wouldn't be happening were it not for the pool of highly educated technology workers the condos have brought into the city."
The big question is whether all this construction will translate into sustainable economic growth for Toronto.
Mr. Lyon, who describes himself as "a believer," says the condo boom essentially makes the city function more productively. Intensification gives rise to non-economic benefits such as more transit ridership, energy savings and greater efficiency in municipal services such as garbage handling.
Others aren't convinced. Pointing to an earlier generation of high-density towers, Councillor Vaughan says there's a risk that consumers may sour on the glut of tiny suites, leading to losses in market value and condo towers that come to be dominated by low-income tenants.
Douglas Young, co-ordinator of York University's urban studies program, points to another pressing issue: "The state of [the city's] infrastructure - physical, social and natural - is in pretty lousy shape." Yet planners continue to approve thousands of new condo units, he says. "You have these fabulous looking high-rises from a distance, but getting from them to somewhere else in the city can be a real pain in the backside."
Mr. Lyon counters that the $20,000-to-$30,000 per-unit fee imposed by the city (parks levies, development charges and so on) help underwrite the cost of municipal infrastructure improvements ranging from new transit service to libraries.
From his Liberty Village showroom, Rob Whitfield sees no end to the forest of condo towers rising around him, nor a lessening in demand for his products. Casalife recently opened a new outlet in Vaughan, north of Toronto, which has its own big plans to develop high-rise condos and offices in a city-centre to be served by a new subway extension. As he sees it, "I'm a bit of a pioneer."

DEALING WITH DEVELOPERS
In April, 2007, Toronto launched a two-year pilot project to establish a "design review panel" to buff up the city's architecture standards, especially for large-scale towers that can radically alter streetscapes and the pedestrian realm.
The move was the city's response to growing concerns among neighbourhood groups that developers are building increasingly enormous condo towers with little regard to their look, especially at grade.
But the other source of inspiration was the City of Vancouver, which has relied for years on a design review panel, comprised of architects, engineers and planners, to vet development proposals. Projects that don't pass muster go back to the proverbial drawing board.
Vancouver's design panel is just one of a series of discretionary planning policies that sharply differentiate Toronto from the West Coast metropolis. Unlike in Ontario, Vancouver developers can't appeal planning decisions to a quasi-judicial body. City planners, in turn, encounter less interference from local councillors, meaning they can fast-track applications and increase site densities while demanding more from builders in terms of benefits to the public, such as day-care centres, arts facilities and landscaping.
"Things tend to go more predictably," Robert Freedman, Toronto's head of urban design, says of the Vancouver model. "It's less convoluted and not nearly as political."
There's an even more important dividend, however. Vancouver's approach, says that city's retired planning director, Larry Beasley, has created "a neighbourhood environment at high density that consumers find very attractive because it is not just housing they are purchasing but a complete residential/neighbourhood lifestyle. This has added huge value to private market projects."
Mr. Beasley says that developers, "after a period of watching the results on their bottom lines, have now generally become happy to make contributions ... to get through the Vancouver system."
The City of Toronto is not placid when dealing with developers who want to build above existing height or density limits. It levies fees, known as "Section 37" benefits, to help offset such projects.
Since 1998, the city has collected $48-million in Section 37 fees. The funds, another form of economic spinoff, go toward heritage protection, day care, public art and other community amenities.

Full text: There are lots of ways to add character to your house, and part of the fun of doing it is scouring architectural salvage stores
We diverted from form when we bought our current 15-year-old house. Usually, we gravitated toward older homes. But, despite its age, our house did have some of the character we craved: The rooms were large and gracious, ceilings were a good height, many rooms had hardwood flooring, and there were two fireplaces with the potential for a third. We wanted to add to this character, so we set about "oldifying" the house.
I'm not talking about selecting a certain style of furniture or decor when I say "oldify." We used that tactic, too, of course, but we also added some infrastructure features to achieve the feel we wanted, and we're happy with the results. Here's what you can do if you want your fairly new home to have more vintage character.
Add mouldings, whether it's crown mouldings, trim around doors and windows, or higher baseboards, bumping up the scale of your home's trim, or adding period-style trim where there isn't any, will give you an instant visual payback. And don't be stingy with scale. A skimpy crown moulding, for example, in a large, high ceilinged room is the visual equivalent to a pea sitting on a stack of mattresses.
If you have the budget, you could splurge on real plaster for your crown mouldings, but you don't have to break the bank. Many people prefer wood while others swear by composite wood products. Both are reasonably priced compared with plaster, which, while beautiful, requires skill - even artisanship - to install. I'm not arguing against plaster, just presenting some options depending on your budget.
Period mouldings were usually quite substantial, sometimes even elaborate, creeping into rooms by a foot or more on the ceiling as well as several inches down the wall. You don't have to go to that extreme to get the look. If you're adding a crown moulding, staying in the range of five to seven inches high should do the trick.
Baseboards often went as high as 18 inches so try a look that's at least two inches higher than the standard four-inch baseboard and consider building it outward slightly as well, perhaps with some door-stop trim added where the baseboard meets the floor. With any type of trim, play around with samples from your local hardware or lumber store (they're often free) to get the scale right.
Install a few ceiling medallions as well. They're inexpensive - depending on circumference, they're usually under $50 - and can be found at lighting and many of the bigger hardware stores. Install them as anchors for suspended ceiling light fixtures for an elegant detail. But don't limit yourself to light fixtures. For example, we don't have a ceiling fixture in our master bedroom so the medallion that was already there now contains the smoke detector. Just keep it to one medallion a room unless the space is huge.
Floor heating grates present another opportunity to add subtle detail. A few years ago at an interior design show in Toronto, I saw heating grates that had been laser cut into intricate patterns using the finest of woods. They were small pieces of art that cost about $300 and up. Unfortunately, I couldn't afford even one and, more unfortunately, I've lost the artisan's contact information so I can't share it with you. We opted for black metal grates with scroll designs from the hardware store. They're inexpensive (about $10 each) and come in a variety of finishes. Restoration Hardware carries a more upscale version that costs between $40 and $50.
Authentic or reproduction hardware is another good way to add historic detail. Lee Valley Tools is one good Canadian source for well-made reproduction hardware. Other great sources are architectural salvage stores.
In our area (near Cobourg, Ont.), Legacy Vintage Building Materials and Antiques has such a range of offerings it even draws designers from Toronto, a 90-minute drive away, looking for that special piece. Like many stores of this nature, Legacy sells everything from antique door knobs, cabinet latches, knobs and pulls to lighting, reclaimed flooring and stair parts.
You could oldify your staircase, for example, by swapping your existing newel post for a more elaborately carved antique version.
We found a carved wall shelf at Legacy for our powder room. By adding an anaglyptic wallpaper, installing moulding about 18 inches down from the ceiling, putting in the shelf below the moulding, and painting everything a metallic bronze colour, our powder room went from bland to full of character.
You can also take your oldifying efforts outside by installing reclaimed window shutters or adding an old iron fence to the yard or garden.
You're guaranteed to have fun oldifying, especially if you scour salvage stores for what tickles your fancy. Check out your region's business directory for architectural salvage stores near you. But, if you're seriously into oldifying like we are, be prepared to spend hours just browsing in awe through a plethora of beautiful and aged artifacts brimming with history. But empty your car trunk before you go. Better yet, bring a truck.

Full text: 90 per cent of successful decorating is about being decisive and methodically seeing your project through from start to finish, clipboard in hand
It's 13 weeks till Christmas.
Okay, I said it. I'm sorry. It's not my intention to be a voice for the consumer culture that would have you begin Christmas shopping as soon as you're done Halloween shopping as soon as you're done back-to-school shopping. But those of you with refurnishing plans in your future may need the insistent beep of a distant early warning.
As a designer, autumn is one of the busiest times of year, and for one simple reason: Within the next month or so, many of you will be standing in your hallway, an evening glass of Pinot Grigio in your hand, overhearing your partner - gulp -inviting his or her family over for the holidays. All of which means that the decorating plans that have idled on the backburner all summer are now coming boiling and splashing to the fore.
Now, the family-arrival scenario may send various feelings - anything from joy to pure, atomizing despair - coursing through you. Your emotional response doesn't much matter; if you want to get through the furniture and lighting selection, the painting, and the accessorizing before it's time for 'nog and carols, you have a heap of work to do. (By the way, I'm addressing myself here to the refurnishers; anyone with renovation plans definitely has to wait until the new year.)
If you plan to do it yourself, here are three strategies for preventing stress ulcers over the next three months.
Start the work now
The best way to heighten the natural anxieties of the holiday season is to condense them.
If you're truly a glutton for punishment, I'd advise putting the newspaper down now and taking a lazy September-long mental nap. You can start thinking about the project again after Halloween.
The obstacles between this moment and your sitting in a newly finished living room are many. The biggest one to consider is the limit on your furniture-buying options. After Oct. 1 or so, you won't be able to buy chairs, sofas or tables manufactured outside North America: They won't arrive before Valentine's Day. Unless you get cracking, you'll likely have to forgo that buttery Italian sofa for something local that may require assembly with an Allen key.
Be prepared
If this suggestion seems boy-scouty and obvious, consider it a return to core principles. Your strategy for a refurnishing, which extends to space planning and budgeting, is necessarily complicated.
Only the foolhardy or super-wealthy among us will glance at their space and then head out, credit card in hand, to do battle with the furniture merchants.
Leave chaos theory to the particle physicists; you want order. Measure your space, create an inventory of your needs, and develop a budget to work from. What you're doing at this stage is editing, reducing the vast sweep of possibilities down to a few realizable goals. Not a sofa, table and light fixture, but the sofa, table and light fixture.
Some people seem to think that good interior design is an artistic pursuit, that is, something arrived at instinctively, ecstatically, in a hot blast of inspiration. It's not. There's no substitute for a good eye, but 90 per cent of successful design is about being decisive and seeing your project through from conception to completion.
In your preparations, take advantage of the user-friendly online catalogues provided by every decent housewares retailer. Print off specification sheets and images, and create a binder of colours, possible furniture combinations, and prices. This kind of planning has two major benefits:
1) You don't have to leave your house (all the information you need is available online).
2) When you're finally ready to shop, you can do it U.S. Navy SEALs-style, swooping in to hit tactical targets instead of wandering, cattle-like, through sprawling fields of floor models.
My suggestion? Take a Saturday, and dress in your comfortable clothes; there's no need to impress salespeople with chic duds. Plan for a long day of slogging in the shops, and don't plan to buy anything until later, no matter how great a deal it seems at the time. All you need are your binder of targets, clipboard for note-taking, measuring tape, and digital camera. Oh, and six or seven cups of coffee.
Seek deliverance
Once you've made your purchases, the best thing you can do is take your fate, as much as possible, out of the hands of the experts. However well deliverymen do their jobs, they operate on their own schedules and, as the holidays approach, their lives are complicated by the post-Halloween surge of last-minute home decorators. Scheduling your time around the deliveries is like attempting to sculpt water: The thing resists your hopes and demands, however ardent.
Delivery drivers are perverse creatures. They take delight in coming when they say they wouldn't, in forgetting pieces of your order, and in "accidentally" damaging the parts they do bring. Take your sanity out of their hands by anticipating the worst case and then planning around it. By cashing in some overtime from work and spending a day or two at home, you can co-ordinate the deliveries and installations. Instead of feeling stressed about time, you can resign yourself to homemade cabbage rolls, back issues of your favourite design magazine, and mid-afternoon mulled wine. Or perhaps that's just me.

Full text: HAUNTED BY THE LEGACY OF STARS WHO PLAYED HARD AND RETIRED BROKE, TODAY'S SMART PLAYERS THINK PORTFOLIOS BEFORE PORSCHES
On and off the ice, Mike Modano is the consummate pro.
After 18 years in the National Hockey League, the fleet-footed Dallas Stars centre ranks as one of its greatest talents--last season, he became the highest-scoring American-born player in NHL history. Long before hitting that number, Modano learned to manage his considerable wealth as deftly as he rippled the twine. He was a model conservative investor.
But the rich and famous get a lot of business opportunities chucked their way. Five years ago--at the peak of his career, earning $ 8.5 million (U.S.) a season--Modano took some bad advice that cost him dearly. He estimates that he lost between $ 3 million and $ 4 million on a series of high-risk private investments in the entertainment industry. "From day one, I was really vigilant and very cautious--just play and keep putting it away," Modano recalls. "After 13 years, I was in a position where I could possibly take a couple of chances. I felt excited about it."
Modano's story is far from unique. Hockey lore brims with tales of players who were cross-checked by fiscal mismanagement--sometimes their own, sometimes courtesy of agents or advisers (see "He shoots, he scores ..., " page 23 ). Modano, 38 , says his loss taught him there's no point in rolling the dice. "Our cash flow as professional athletes doesn't last forever, and you need to just let it be and take care of itself."
Investors can learn many lessons from Modano and his peers, whose odd set of financial circumstances present a challenge to even the canniest wealth manager. NHL greenhorns may be young men holding down their first real job, buying their first car and house, and acquiring a taste for stocks and bonds. But their investment needs have much in common with those of wealthy non-athletes twice their age. For both groups, retirement is just over the horizon. The average NHL career lasts a mere five seasons, and an exceptional run rarely extends beyond 15 . Hockey players need a nest egg they can draw on for 50 -odd years, versus 20 for the typical retiree.
Even with league salaries averaging $ 1.9 million last season, putting away enough for a comfortable retirement is easier said than done. Many players still rely on an outdated support team of beer buddies, local bank managers, parents and agents to help them run their money. In most cases, these people are way out of their depth, if they have any financial background at all. Players who defer to unqualified and occasionally unscrupulous advisers--or get lured into lavish lifestyles they can't afford--risk winding up with little to show for a career of fat paycheques.
It's something that wealth manager Stewart Gavin, a former NHLer who now crafts defensive financial game plans for pro hockey players, has seen all too often. He tells a tale of one high-priced free agent he tried to land as a client last summer--only to find out the player planned to entrust his riches to his bartender, who was starting up an investing business on the side.
"For an athlete...the focus is on being the best they can be on the ice, to perform and to advance their career. A lot of times, the rest of it doesn't matter--there's no interest," Gavin says. "It's easy to go out and just buy an $80,000 or $100,000 car because they can. Is it the most prudent decision? No, probably not. But you think you're invincible, it's going to last forever, you've got a lot of money and you don't think of the implications."
Gavin's pay package wasn't quite so generous during his 13 NHL campaigns, but the 48 -year-old knows what it's like to feel reckless. The Ottawa native remembers inking his first contract with the Toronto Maple Leafs at age 20--$55,000 a year, plus a $ 20,000 signing bonus he was itching to spend. But when Gavin ripped open that bonus cheque, he discovered to his horror that it was just $ 12,500 after taxes. "You started to realize, 'Jeez, I thought I had more, and it's already gone.'"
This early disappointment spawned an interest in the financial side of pro hockey that the right winger parlayed into a second career. After a serious knee injury forced him to hang up his skates in 1993 , Gavin eventually found work as senior vice-president at a Bay Street wealth-management shop. Then, in 2003 , he went back to hockey by launching Gavin Management Group. "I knew there was a large need," he says. "I just wanted to do something that would really protect the players and make sure they maximized their financial success while they played."
Atop the Air Canada Centre in Toronto, Gavin Management works with about 30 hockey players, from young minor-leaguers to established NHL superstars such as the Calgary Flames' Jarome Iginla and Eric Staal of the Carolina Hurricanes. Hockey players make up about 60 % of the firm's clientele; the rest are high-net-worth corporate executives. Gavin and his six-member team do traditional portfolio and cash---flow management, but their services also run to lifestyle advice, insurance needs, estate planning and tax strategies.
The basic investment philos-ophy is capital preservation--focused on saving, modest returns and little exposure to downside risk. In exchange, the firm collects an annual fee that starts at 1 % of assets under management and declines as the client's asset base grows. There's also a consulting fee for non-investment services, which in--clude a fair bit of hand-holding.
This conservative approach is the norm for pro-athlete wealth managers, who know their clients don't have much room for error. Steven Conville, Markham, Ontario-based vice-president and associate portfolio manager at Blackmont Capital Inc., does financial planning for a handful of NHLers. He uses a "dog years" analogy: A single lousy year for a hockey player equals seven for a less time-strapped investor. "You don't really realize how much damage that one bad year has on that player's future until after they've retired," Conville says. "You make three or four of these mistakes and you're broke."
Jarome Iginla has lived by the Gavin system since 1996. The Calgary Flames superstar began working with Gavin as a 19 -year-old rookie, when Iginla was naive about finance and worried about making the same mistakes as many players before him. The two met through veteran centre Dave Gagner, Iginla's linemate, who had played with Gavin a few years earlier in Minnesota. "I could tell [Dave] was into the financial side and watched that stuff," Iginla says. "He told me he had this friend, Stew, who would be a good guy to meet."
Iginla, 31 , now earns $ 7 million (U.S.) a year patrolling the right wing for Calgary. But he's careful with his money--a trait inherited from his Nigerian immigrant father and his single mother, who raised him in a modest suburban household in the Edmonton area. Ever since Iginla entered the league, he has tried to avoid the flashy extravagances and big-spending ways that have been the Achilles heel of many wealthy pro athletes.
Well, except maybe that car. By his second season, Iginla was wrestling with the urge to yield to his one great young-and-rich temptation: a Porsche 911 . It would set him back $ 115,000 . "I had read and heard stories of players blowing their cash on spur-of-the-moment things and leaving the game not set up for their future," he says. "So purchasing the car was a big decision for me."
The young Iginla nervously took the idea to the two people who served as his financial conscience. He was surprised when his dad, Elvis, encouraged him to buy his dream wheels. Getting past Gavin took some tighter checking. The money manager gave his consent, but he explained how splurging on the Porsche would affect Iginla's financial goals. "Being able to see the long-term plan helped me feel good about my purchase and enjoy it more," says Iginla, who still uses this method for big-ticket items.
As he does with all his clients, Gavin started out by devising a financial forecast for Iginla--a blueprint designed to ensure he can retire from hockey with enough wealth that he'll never have to work again. Over the years, Iginla's financial plan has been adjusted to incorporate a family. He married his high-school sweetheart, Kara, in 2003 , and the couple had their third child this summer.
Every off-season, Gavin sits down with Jarome and Kara for their annual financial report--a three-hour review that measures their current status against the master plan. The Iginlas receive quarterly performance reports on their investment portfolio. They also keep in touch with Gavin and his associate, Matthew Bacchiochi, throughout the year by phone and e-mail, to discuss any financial issues that arise. These might include investment ideas, business opportunities or large purchases.
Bacchiochi says that for forecasting and planning purposes, Gavin Management assumes a client's playing career will last about eight years. "We try to construct a plan whereby he would accumulate a sufficient pool of capital to finance his lifestyle without eroding the principal," he explains. "With our long-term forecast, we can generally illustrate that if a player exhibits reasonable cash-flow management and has an average career, an after-tax return of 6 % will allow him to achieve financial independence."
For players early in their careers, the portfolio begins as a glorified savings plan, weighted heavily toward short-term money-market instruments. As a client accumulates more to invest, Gavin and Bacchiochi gradually add longer-term fixed-income products, equities and alternative strategies such as hedge funds and private equity. Gavin estimates that a typical player will need to accumulate a liquid capital base of at least $ 3 million in order to maintain his lifestyle after retirement.
A portfolio for a fairly young player--Bacchiochi uses the example of a three-year pro who still earns below the league average--would look shockingly defensive to the average investor in their early 20s . More than half of the player's money would be in cash and fixed in-come, 25% in long-term growth equities and 20 % in al-ternative assets.
On the other hand, Iginla's portfolio is consistent with what Bacchiochi prescribes for "a player who has meaningful net worth and could conceivably be considered financially independent." Its equity weighting approaches 50 %, balanced by 25 % in long-term bonds, 15% in alternatives and 10 % in cash.
Bacchiochi says his firm emphasizes cash-flow management and diversified portfolios. To achieve the latter, Gavin Management favours exchange-traded funds and managed products such as mutual funds and segregated funds, with in--di-vidual securities usually representing only 5 % to 10 % of the portfolio. It also invests across industry sectors and uses alternative assets--which don't typically correlate with movements in the equity markets--for additional downside protection.
Over at Blackmont, Conville's approach may be even more conservative. His standard allocation is 60% in fixed income and 40 % in globally diversified blue-chip stocks. "It's really about just quietly growing," Conville says. "What we do is not sexy."
While Iginla's portfolio fits the low-risk mould, he says he's proudest of his more aggressive holdings. In particular, he likes the Sprott Hedge Fund II, which has earned an average annual return of 13.2 % since its August, 2002, inception; and the Acuity Canadian Small Cap Fund, which has averaged 12.3% since its inception in July, 2005 . Iginla also keeps 5 % to 10% of his portfolio to manage by himself and experiment with his own investing ideas. He has some real-estate investments, but they're a tiny fraction of the mix.
"When I first got into the league, I definitely was risk-averse. I really couldn't imagine seeing money go down," Iginla says. "But as the years go by...you get more of an understanding that that's all part of it: Do it right and it will work out long term. But I still would say I'm a conservative investor."
The same goes for Iginla's lifestyle, though his penchant for sports cars remains. (He now has two, the Porsche and a 2007 BMW M6 , but plans to trade them in for a 2009 Porsche Turbo.) He and Kara have a house in Calgary and a summer home in the Okanagan, a popular vacation region in central British Columbia. Last year, Iginla bought a 12.5% interest in his junior-hockey alma mater, the Kamloops Blazers, as did several other former Kamloops players including NHL stars Mark Recchi, Shane Doan and Darryl Sydor. He also dabbles in the restaurant business: He co-owns a small bar and restaurant with some friends--it long ago paid for itself--and shares a Dairy Queen franchise with family members. That's about it.
"I hope to play until I'm 40 years old or somewhere around there, so hopefully I have 10 more years left," Iginla says. "Then I'll have more time to put into [my investments], and can watch things more closely. But right now, it's more about capital preservation."
That might sound like a dull way to spend your millions, but as Iginla and Modano both know, it's the ticket to financial freedom long after the cheering ends. "Once a guy is making $1 million a year...it's really more a matter of what you don't do," Conville says. "When they're in a mall when they're 60 signing autographs, I want it to be because they want to, not because they have to."
HE SHOOTS, HE SCORES LOW ON FINANCIAL SAVVY
Time and time again, pro hockey players have proven themselves to be clumsy stickhandlers when it comes to managing money.
In 1976, the legendary Bobby Orr hit the jackpot with a $3-million (all figures U.S. currency) contract to defect from the Boston Bruins to the Chicago Blackhawks. But by 1980, the blueliner was near bankruptcy, owing hundreds of thousands in back taxes and legal and accounting fees. This mess led to his acrimonious split from his long-time agent and friend, the notorious Alan Eagleson. Orr's ordeal remains hockey's No. 1 cautionary tale about entrusting your money to the wrong guy.
More recently, New York Islanders great Bryan Trottier filed for bankruptcy in 1994, with assets of $141,000 and a staggering $9.5 million in debts. His undoing was a series of failed real estate investments, in particular a costly ice-rink venture that folded.
Then there's forward Darren M c Carty , whose 2006 insolvency saw him report assets of $1.9 million and debts of $6.2 million. McCarty had been earning more than $2 million a year with the Detroit Red Wings, but after he went a year without pay in the 2004-'05 NHL lockout, the team dropped him for salary-cap reasons. He then signed with the Calgary Flames for less than half his previous income. The pay cut--combined with a divorce, casino debts and bad loans to gambling buddies--left McCarty deep in the hole.
But the poster boy for pointlessly wasting a hockey fortune is Orr's ex-teammate Derek Sanderson .
The flamboyant centre was once the highest-paid player in professional sports. For jumping from the Stanley Cup champion Bruins to the Philadelphia Blazers of the upstart World Hockey Association in 1972, Sanderson secured a $2.65-million salary--paid up front. It was an astronomical sum for the time, but not so much that it couldn't be squandered.
Sanderson sat down with financial advisers after landing the contract, but he says they baffled him with investment jargon. "I said, 'Just make sure I don't go broke,' " he recalls. "And never paid attention to it. I gave my lawyer power of attorney. That was my first mistake."
Within a few years, all the money was gone--wasted on drugs, spending sprees, fair-weather friends and silly investments. Sanderson was broke and homeless. But after sobering up in 1980, he became a financial adviser himself. The 62-year-old Sanderson now works with Howland Capital Management in Boston, where he has about 20 NHL clients, including veterans Keith Tkachuk and Glen Wesley.
"Now I have two children and I think, 'God, if I only had the money for them,' Sanderson says. "If I'd just managed it properly, if I hadn't been so foolish--those are the things I try to teach the players." - D.P.

Full text: Canada's more than 2,000 federal and provincial judges are coming under harsher public scrutiny
Minutes after Ontario Superior Court's Mr. Justice Paul Cosgrove threw himself at the mercy of a disciplinary panel last week by apologizing for a multitude of courtroom lapses, the 73-year-old judge walked out of the Toronto hearing and sank into a hallway chair.
The dejected judge probably understood that he had played his last legal card before the disciplinary panel. After mounting a four-year court battle to thwart the probe, he reversed gears last Thursday with a dramatic apology for his conduct in a botched murder trial that ended more than a decade ago.
"I stand before you humbled and chastened ... At times I lost my way," Judge Cosgrove told a Canadian Judicial Council (CJC) panel of three judges and two lawyers in an attempt to explain his erratic rulings during an acrimonious two-year trial.
The 11th-hour plea failed to persuade the panel to shut down the inquiry, which concluded last week. It is expected to take months for the panel to announce whether the federally appointed judge's actions amounted to misconduct. If the CJC as a whole agrees with such a finding, the former Liberal cabinet minister could become the first judge in Canada to face a Parliamentary misconduct vote.
There is more than Judge Cosgrove's job and pension at stake. Last week's drama serves as the latest sign that the country's more than 2,000 federal and provincial judges are coming under harsher public scrutiny. The long wait for the panel's hearing is also reminder that justice moves at a very slow pace when it comes to reviewing the conduct of judges.
Misconduct charges against judges have increased steadily in recent years, with the CJC reporting 189 complaints against about 1,000 federal judges last year. That's a 36-per-cent rise from the level in 2003. Judges are also being pulled into the political glare as the proliferation of challenges under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms requires them to pass judgment on such red-hot controversies as minority rights and abortion law.
No judge, no matter how senior, seems to be immune. Last month, a group of Christian and anti-abortion organizations filed a complaint with the CJC demanding Supreme Court of Canada Chief Justice Beverley McLachlin be removed from office for "bias" and "a political agenda." Her offence, they claimed, is that she chairs the advisory committee that selected Dr. Henry Morgentaler for an Order of Canada. Chairing the advisory committee is a chief justice role mandated by federal legislation.
"We are seeing a lot more complaints. While there should be accountability and transparency, there are some situations in which the complaints process is becoming politicized," said Paul Cavalluzzo, a Toronto lawyer and judicial expert.
Mr. Cavalluzzo represents Ontario Superior Court Mr. Justice Ted Matlow, who is awaiting a CJC decision on an earlier panel finding that the judge improperly lobbied politicians and the media to oppose a real estate development near his Toronto home.
Ever since the Canadian Judicial Council was founded in 1971 to promote accountability and transparency in the once-cloistered profession, judicial experts have fretted that the complaint process could be abused to undermine the judiciary's independence.
Until the Cosgrove case, judicial independence hasn't been much of a concern because the vast majority of complaints were dismissed.
Of the nearly 3,000 complaints filed with the CJC since 1971, only seven led to public hearings. Only four hearings produced recommendations that judges should be fired for misconduct. Federally appointed judges can only be removed from the bench by a Parliamentary vote. Such a vote has never been called because the judges in question resigned or, in one case, the CJC overturned a panel's call for dismissal.
What makes the Cosgrove case so compelling is the nature of the complaint he faces. The vast majority of complaints filed with the CJC or provincial councils involve allegations of inappropriate courtroom statements or behaviour, including sexist, racist or profane comments. One judge got his knuckles rapped for referring to some fellow judges as "dumb." Others apologized for shouting, pounding the bench or taking too long to render decisions.
The complaint against Judge Cosgrove is the first time a judge has been challenged for the way he arrived at a judgment. At the heart of complaint against him is the allegation that his process for arriving at a decision to throw out a murder case amounted to misconduct. In other words, the central question is whether the judge was competent when he made his ruling.
The case involved charges that Julia Yvonne Elliott murdered and dismembered her boyfriend in 1995. Despite extensive evidence, Judge Cosgrove found the Crown and other justice officials had committed 150 constitutional violations and dismissed the case. The decision was overturned by the Ontario Court of Appeal, which delivered a scathing rebuke to Judge Cosgrove. That decision triggered a four-year battle between the judge and Ontario's Attorney-General over whether the CJC had the constitutional right to hear a complaint about his competence.
Several judges have filed letters of support for Judge Cosgrove to prevent a misconduct ruling that his lawyer Chris Palliare has warned could have a "chilling effect" on judicial independence.

A cross-Canada sample
JEAN BIENVENUE,
QUEBEC SUPERIOR COURT
Misconduct complaint: While sentencing a woman in 1995 for the murder of her husband, Judge Bienvenue said victims of the Holocaust died without suffering and that women can sink to depths "to which even the vilest of men could not sink."Review: A majority of judges at the Canadian Judicial Council voted in favour of asking Canada's Justice Minister to fire Judge Bienvenue.Outcome: Days before the government was to decide whether or not to call a parliamentary vote on the issue, the judge resigned.
PAUL COSGROVE,
SUPERIOR COURT OF ONTARIO
Misconduct complaint: Ontario's Attorney-General filed a complaint about Judge Cosgrove's conduct after the Ontario Court of Appeal overturned his 1999 ruling that murder charges against Julia Yvonne Elliott be dismissed because of abuses by the Crown.
Review: A public inquiry was called by the CJC, but the hearing was delayed by four years after Judge Cosgrove challenged the power of the Attorney-General to order an inquiry.
Outcome: The inquiry ended last week and a decision is expected within months.
PETER LEASK,
SUPREME COURT OF BRITISH COLUMBIA
Misconduct complaint: During a drug trial in 2007, Judge Leask swore four times at a prosecutor during his closing arguments.
Review: Days after local media reports about the courtroom profanity, Judge Leask appeared in court to make "an unreserved apology ... that my behaviour was inexcusable."
Outcome: The CJC said last September that although the judge's remarks "brought discredit on the judiciary" it would take no action in light of his "clear and unambiguous apology."

Toronto, Calgary set for rise in office vacancies

Author: McLeod, Lori

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/toronto-calgary-set-rise-office-vacancies/docview/382688623/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "Beginning in 2010, both Toronto and Calgary especially will become a tenant market instead of an owner market. There will be a sudden and dramatic increase in Class A office space in downtown Toronto but a slower one in Calgary because the new inventory will be added gradually," Stefan Ciotlos, president of CB Richard Ellis, said in a statement.

Full text: The vacancy rate for Canadian office space is expected to jump when new supply floods the market next year, according to a report released yesterday by CB Richard Ellis Ltd.
Building booms in Toronto and Calgary will soon bring the first significant new stream of office space since the early 1990s, welcome relief for tenants bursting at the seams but also cause for concern at a time the economy is slowing.
"Beginning in 2010, both Toronto and Calgary especially will become a tenant market instead of an owner market. There will be a sudden and dramatic increase in Class A office space in downtown Toronto but a slower one in Calgary because the new inventory will be added gradually," Stefan Ciotlos, president of CB Richard Ellis, said in a statement.
In most Canadian cities, vacancy rates are at or near historic lows, averaging just 3.9 per cent nationwide in the third quarter of 2008. That's expected to rise to 5.9 per cent by the end of 2009.
In Toronto, which represents 35 per cent of Canada's office market, the vacancy rate is set to rise to 12 per cent in the first quarter of 2010 as 3.1 million square feet of new space comes to market, the report said.
There are currently 34.3 million square feet of space in the downtown Class A office market in Toronto. New buildings slated for completion next year include the Bay Adelaide Centre, the RBC Centre and the Telus Tower, which are all near Toronto's financial core.
The rise in capacity, along with spillover from economic weakness in the United States, is expected to push downtown Toronto rents lower, said a report by Colliers International, also released yesterday.
Office rents in downtown Toronto are expected to fall by about $4 a square foot to the $20-a-square-foot level, the Colliers report said.
"Two main factors impact the GTA [Greater Toronto Area] office market performance in the short term: length and depth of the global economic downturn and the time it will take for the local market, mainly in the downtown core, to absorb the new office space expected to be delivered in 2009 and 2010," says Ian MacCulloch, Canadian vice-president of research at Colliers.
The new buildings will help tenants crowded into their current offices, and create the first wave of "green" office projects in the city. But they'll also come to market as the province of Ontario faces a weakening economic outlook and continuing uncertainty from the U.S. financial crisis.
The manufacturing slump has put Toronto's economic growth outlook at just 1.3 per cent for 2008, according to a study released this week by the Conference Board of Canada. That's 12th of 13 big cities across Canada included in the report.
The other Canadian city in which major office construction is under way is Calgary, where growth in gross domestic product is expected to come in at a much healthier 3.2 per cent this year due to strength in the energy services sector, according to the Conference Board report.
Calgary, which represents 12 per cent of the Canadian office market, has 720,000 square feet of new space slated for completion next year - and millions more are under development.
The CB Richard Ellis report said vacancy rates are expected to go up in Calgary, but did not provide a forecast to quantify the increase.
There was virtually no available office space in Calgary or Vancouver in the third quarter, the report said. Markets are also tight across the rest of the country, except in two Ontario locales, London and the Waterloo region, where vacancy rates were 14.2 and 7.9 per cent, respectively.

Full text: Let's dance.
As any fool can see, there's plenty to worry about: Investment banks collapsing, weasel politicians peddling their wares, foods being withdrawn from stores because people have died from eating them, trains crashing, planes crashing and a new study of 6,500 executives says 35 per cent of them would choose their BlackBerry over their spouse.
What are you gonna do? Well, as that guru on matters of heartache - one Bryan Ferry - informed us, "Dance away the heartache/ Dance away the tears." Oh, indeed. The man who called himself a slave to love and is as melancholy as all get-out, concluded, "Let the strobe light up them all/ I close my eyes and dance till dawn." Wise words, you'll agree. When times are bad and you're feeling wan, a bit of dancing is the only cure.
So You Think You Can Dance Canada (CTV, 8 p.m.) arrived last week with considerable hoopla and, by heavens, it did not disappoint. The show is an international franchise, of course, with a set format: judges, dancers, voting. Could a Canadian version be better than the usual thing? Yep. There were some astonishing moves, manoeuvres, turns and locomotions going on at the first audition shows, taped in Toronna, Vancouver and Halifax.
The U.S. version, which was a hit again this past summer on Fox and here on CTV, is enjoyable, but already it seems a tad too slick and fussily show-business. The contestants are familiar with the template and, while there were outstanding performers and memorable moments, the sheen of American glitz meant that the show looked like one long variation on the Broadway musical A Chorus Line .
Mind you, So You Think You Can Dance is still a better bet for pure entertainment than American Idol or Canadian Idol . On those, the singers and the songs tend toward blandness. On So You Think You Can Dance, there's real variation - all sorts of genres, styles and forms are attempted.
So it was with the first Canadian shows last week. The variety and level of sophistication, not to mention originality, were remarkable. There were very few contestants who could be dismissed as hopeless or deluded. Some, including a kid named Graeme from Oakville, Ont., were breathtaking. The judging also was pretty entertaining. Mary Murphy, imported from the U.S. version for some episodes, was downright hysterical at times. She declared to one contestant, in an astonishing squeal, "You are fire, you are strength, you are woman." Not a Bryan Ferry lyric, obviously, but memorable.
The show continues tonight with auditions in Calgary and Montreal. It's fine entertainment. By the way, host Leah Miller informs me that, yes, she is perfectly capable of doing the Watusi (official instructions: "The dancer, knees slightly bent, is almost stationary, although may advance forward and back by one or two small rhythmic paces. The arms, with palms flat in line, are held almost straight, alternately flail up and down in the vertical. The head is kept in line with the upper torso but may bob slightly to accentuate the arm-flailing"), though she has yet to prove it to me.
'Til Death (Fox, 9 p.m.) is back, and if your taste runs to really old-fashioned sitcoms, it's for you. One of the few sitcoms still filmed mostly on a soundstage in front of an audience, it has hoary old jokes and stock characters. Newlyweds Jeff and Steph move in next door to Eddie (Brad Garrett from Everybody Loves Raymond ) and Joy (Joely Fisher), who have been married for than 20 years. As the show has evolved, which isn't much, the focus is on the bickering between Eddie and Joy. He's put-upon, she's snippety, but they love each other. There you go, life as it is lived on U.S. network TV.
Check local listings.
Also airing tonight
The National: Your Turn with Jack Layton (CBC Newsworld, 7 p.m.; CBC, 10 p.m.) is the first of a series of election specials. You e-mail questions. Pastor Mansbridge puts the questions to Layton - who says he is applying for Stephen Harper's job. I dunno. His hair is all wrong, for a start.
The Royal Family (ABC, 9 p.m.) is a repeat of the ratings hit for ABC. The special chronicles a year in the lives of members of the Royal Family, and Barbara Walters hosts. She starts thus: "This is Buckingham Palace, where Queen Elizabeth II has reigned for 55 years, and her family for centuries. This is called the grand entrance, which tourists can pay to see on guided visits. But thanks to an exclusive arrangement with British filmmakers, we'll go well beyond the public areas of this palace tonight, into the private spaces and lives of the Royal Family. ... No one in the general public has ever gotten as close as you will tonight." It's not true, but watching Walters trying not to look awed is amusing.
The Riches (Showcase, 10 p.m.) is good even when it wanders into farce. It's still about a family of con artists trying to steal the American Dream. Tonight, Wayne (Eddie Izzard) tries to save the real-estate deal that will make him a multimillionaire. J.D.

Full text: Marketing Regent Park's first condo won't be easy. If the scheme fails, so will the $1-billion plan to save the housing project
In the squat brick buildings of the old Regent Park, sheets serve as curtains in many of the single-paned windows. On the side of one wall, a mural of a young boy casts a concerned gaze over the graffiti-scarred housing project, a place infamous for its drugs, violence and grinding poverty.
In stark contrast to all this stands a wall of sleek placards at the corner of Dundas and Parliament streets, on the western boundary of the neighbourhood. The signs trumpet the arrival of a new condo dubbed "One Cole," a project fronted with the daunting tagline, "One changes everything."
Indeed, the developers and city officials behind the neighbourhood's $1-billion redevelopment are hoping that One Cole will help to change everything for Regent Park by luring in middle-class condo dwellers, transforming a slum into a mixed-income community.
That's why One Cole's marketing drive - which hasn't even formally begun, despite a plan to welcome residents next spring - will be so crucial to Regent Park's future.
Considering the housing project's bad rap and hefty competition from other downtown condos, will buyers turn on their heels?
It's a big marketing challenge, but the Daniels Corporation, the developer behind One Cole and the Regent Park revitalization, says it's prepared to counter the stigma.
The placards at Dundas and Parliament avoid the words "Regent Park," but One Cole's website provides links to archived press releases about Daniels's role in razing and rebuilding the neighbourhood.
Martin Blake, vice-president of project implementation for Daniels, says the company is considering using the project's infamous name when it launches its full marketing campaign by year's end.
"We've never shied away from it," Mr. Blake said, referring to the fact that the company's name has always been attached to the concept of Regent Park's revitalization. "We're very proud of the architecture of this project and we're trying to show that at this point."
While Daniels says that about 1,000 people have registered for the chance to buy one of the 293 units starting at $189,900, the developer is building first, selling later - a rare move in Toronto's condo market. It suggests that Daniels is wise to the challenge of marketing a blighted pocket of the city, says Jeanhy Shim, a real-estate analyst with Toronto-based Thinkbuild Consulting Inc.
"Whether rightly or wrongly, the perception was that the neighbourhood had a bad reputation," Ms. Shim says. "[Building first] shows the developer is confident in the community."
The company took the same approach with a handful of other condo developments in Toronto, Mr. Blake says, citing three recent Daniels projects in North York.
"It's one thing to be able to go to a community sales centre and see what may be happening in the future ... but to actually be able to be there and point to your unit in the building and be like, 'Wow, that's my balcony, I'm going to live there,' that's a fantastic thing for purchasers."
Toronto real-estate marketing expert Roman Bodnarchuk, chief executive officer of N5R.com, thinks that Daniels should keep the name "Regent Park" out of the condo ads. "We've had 40 years of this negative stigma, and it's very hard in an ad campaign to change it," he says.
"As soon as you say 'Regent Park,' people have a lot of powerful images and a lot of those don't include lining up to buy a condo."
The bottom line is that if the developers can't persuade middle-class shoppers to snap up property in Regent Park, the mixed-income revitalization plan risks failure, experts say. "It would be unfortunate if the whole project went down the tubes because they can't attract middle-class residents," says Alison Bain, a professor of urban geography at York University. "[But] despite the stigma that's attached to this neighbourhood, I can think of any number of neighbourhoods in downtown Toronto that have been totally transformed through gentrification," she says, citing Leslieville, Yorkville and Queen Street West.
"It shouldn't at all be a challenge to attract new middle-class condo dwellers [to Regent Park]," she says, especially since the neighbourhood is so close to downtown.
Regent Park might attract people who embrace the identity of what was once considered a revolutionary social-housing experiment, Ms. Bain says.
Perhaps folks like those who snapped up condos in St. Lawrence Market - a rare but workable mix of owned apartments, co-ops, rent-controlled and subsidized housing - will be keen to buy into One Cole.
"If you look at the scale of the architecture [in St. Lawrence] and the surrounding buildings, it's not overwhelming. It's not big glass towers," Ms. Bain says.
However, big and glass is just what Phase One of Regent's revitalization is shaping up to be.
The rendering of One Cole in the ads does offer a hint of the old red brick, but most of the new building's design is slick and crystalline.
But slick isn't everyone's style, and some people who live in the neighbourhood or walk by One Cole's future home struggle to find remnants of Regent in the ads.
"I think they're trying to get a little more street cred by dumping the name Regent Park," says passerby Helene Kay as she surveys the snazzy signs for One Cole.
On a bench alongside Regent Park's local swimming pool, lifelong resident Heather Bingelman, 34, corrals her five children, yelling after each one to keep them in line.
She sighs and dismisses the hoarding with one wave of her hand.
"They're not acknowledging Regent Park," she said.
"They're disregarding us and who we are and how we created this."
Phases of construction
* To be completed in 12 to 15 years; expected to grow to 12,500 people from the original 7,500.
* The original roster of 2,100 Toronto Community Housing Corp. rental units will be fully replaced; 1,800 units will be within Regent Park and 300 in the surrounding streets. The revitalized Regent will be a diverse mix of housing, with roughly 60 per cent at market prices and 40 per cent subsidized rentals.
* Phase One will cover four city blocks with a mix of market and rental housing in five buildings and five blocks of town homes. It kicks off with the two-building, $60-million One Cole condos at Parliament and Dundas Streets with 293 units; one-bedrooms start at $189,900.
* Working in conjunction with the Toronto Community Housing Corp. on the revitalization plan, Daniels is developing, building and selling all the market and rental buildings in the brand-new Regent Park.

Full text: THE WORLD IS WHAT IT IS
The Authorized Biography of V. S. Naipaul
By Patrick French
Viking Canada, 480 pages, $36
In 1993, Patricia Naipaul went to retrieve her husband's partial archive in the London warehouse where it was being kept. The material included all his earliest manuscripts, along with correspondence from the 1950s and '60s. The numbered box files, marked NAIPAUL, were missing. After investigation, it was learned that a purge of boxes marked NITRATE, after a South American company, had mistakenly included those of somewhat similar title.
"Always conscious of his own projected destiny," Patrick French writes of Naipaul's loss of a third of his past, "he had preserved everything." In explaining his sense of the accident, V. S. Naipaul outlined typically astringent standards for the credible biographical project.
"I am a great believer in the record," he said, "that the truth is wonderful and that any doctored truth is awful. I have great trouble reading other people's autobiographies because I feel it is doctored. So the stuff that was destroyed in the warehouse, lots of embarrassing things, that was part of the record."
Fifteen years later, Naipaul must surely be declaring the wonder of The World Is What It Is . French's biography of the winner of the 2001 Nobel Prize for Literature isn't only superb. It is also replete with undoctored truths and embarrassing things. Enriched by complete access to both Naipaul's own (surviving) archive and the diaries kept by Patricia, who died of cancer in 1996, along with extensive interviews with the subject, the book is indeed close to the complete record.
It is, in effect, The Author Is What He Is, and in the case of the outrageous, impossible Sir Vidia Naipaul, that is a creature to behold.
Vidyadhar Naipaul was born in Trinidad in 1932. His parents were the children of Indians driven by starvation to attempt three-month sea voyages in order to work as indentured labourers on island estates. Indians then comprised one-third of the island's population, and were thought by other inhabitants to be "poor, mean, rural, heathen, aggressive, ethnically exclusive and illiterate."
The Naipauls were different. Both sides were Brahmins, the scholar-priest caste. The father, Seepersad, was a reporter for a local paper who wrote short stories about his cloistered community. He named his first-born son after an Indian king. "It was a grand name," Naipaul said later. "I think great things were expected of me."
The intense boy known as Vido grew up internalizing those expectations, especially his father's thwarted literary ambitions. Naipaul fortunes remained modest - the large family had to squeeze into a clan commune in the Trinidadian capital Port of Spain - but their intellectual capacities were expansive.
Vido was neither the first nor last to win one of three annual scholarships to England. An uncle had done it years before; his brother Shiva would eventually follow in his footsteps. A sister won a scholarship to study in India. As such, Naipauls were part of what Jean-Paul Sartre called the "native elite," manufactured by the European overlords according to the colonial model.
At Oxford, the brown-skinned Indian from Trinidad was twice the outsider. He was profoundly unanchored, and as he wrote of a character in the novel Half a Life , had to learn the basics of social interactions all over again. He also came to realize that his past was a blank to the English. He was "free to present himself as he wished." Anonymity of this degree meant "the possibilities were dizzying."
For Naipaul, part of that presentation would involve an emphasis on "dignified Brahmism." It would also oblige a brutal separation from his inherited self as a colonial from an obscure island. French summarizes the process: "Ambitious, protean, made of smart material, deracinated by the accelerated politics of the end of empire, Vidia made a conscious choice to refashion himself."
The emergence of the phenomenon known as V. S. Naipaul took some years and several books, including his fresh early novel The Mystic Masseur and the story collection Miguel Street . Still, by the age of just 29, he was author of A House for Mr. Biswas , a novel that would "come to be seen as an epic of postcolonial literature," and was on his way home to report a book that would forever set him apart from the place that had birthed him.
The Middle Passage , published in 1962, declared Caribbean island culture to be barely redeemable. "Brutality is not the only difficulty," Naipaul wrote. "History is built around achievement and creation; and nothing was created in the West Indies." The desire to shock was real, as was the brilliance and perception of the prose. "Through the force of his tirade, or detonation," French remarks, "V. S. Naipaul was seeking a response."
So began the major rhythm of a remarkable career: novels and travel books of brilliance and perception, tirade and shock. French is an incisive reader, and his framings of the works themselves, often focusing on a few key aspects of their creation, stand alone as elegant essays on the artistic process. He also brings to the project a lofty but persuasively argued judgment of Naipaul as an essential voice, as well as a stylist of the highest quality.
But what of the man himself? If there is a single reason why The World Is What It Is will remain a landmark in literary biography for some time, it may be the almost perverse exceptionalism of its circumstance. In granting full access to his archives, and to his first wife's diaries, and to himself; in almost encouraging French to craft a narrative out of the often sordid details of his personal life and habits, Naipaul wills the book to a level of candour and intimacy appropriate to his self-regard.
To ask the obvious question - why would he do such a thing? - is to misunderstand Naipaul's sense of his own exceptional nature, and destiny. "I was not interested," he tells French at the outset, "and I remain completely indifferent to how people think of me, because I was serving this thing called literature."
A more interesting subtitle for the book would have been: A Great Author and His Suffering Women. French's compassionate attention to the life of Pat Naipaul is moving. The author's English wife, the result of an early, sexually arid marriage, suffered mostly for the truth that "Vidia's conception of himself was too fragile and narcissistic for his personality to be merged with another."
He was also mentally abusive, treating her more as secretary and maid than companion or lover. Her inability to produce children was still another source of grief.
Frequent visits to prostitutes eased his sexual frustration. In midlife, he also began a quarter-century-long affair with an Argentine named Margaret. "This was big, potent news for Vidia," French reports of the first of his lover's abortions, "not only was he good at sex, but he was fertile, able to father a child." His open relationship with Margaret - she travelled with him for years - left his wife broken. "I was liberated," Naipaul says. "She was destroyed. It was inevitable."
Equally inevitable, perhaps, was the sequence of events by which the mistress was finally sent packing (with cash settlement), the fatally ill Pat was dealt her final humiliation, and the current Lady Naipaul, Pakistani journalist Nadira Khannum Alvi, was installed.
Suffice to say that the sequence, if told as fiction, would merit accusations of improbability, including the blackly funny picture of the long-serving family maid, "shocked to the core," preparing food for the new bride.
Then there is the ending. Between Naipaul's own admission - "It could be said that I killed her. ... I feel a little bit that way" - and the final image of Nadira being sent into the English woods to scatter the ashes of the woman she has supplanted, while the author leans against his car, "tears streaming down his face," The World Is What It Is concludes on a note of vitality and strangeness that is likewise in keeping with its subject. What a wonder, indeed, is V. S. Naipaul.
Contributing reviewer Charles Foran is writing a biography of Mordecai Richler. His most recent book is the essay collection Join the Revolution, Comrade.
Looking and writing
A WRITER'S PEOPLE
Ways of Looking and Feeling
By V. S. Naipaul
Knopf Canada, 189 pages, $29.95
Patrick French halts his biography in October, 1996, five years before Naipaul's Nobel Prize. A Writer's People is Naipaul's first original non-fiction book in a decade. An "essay in five parts" exploring his creative and intellectual evolution, the material is no less pleasing for its familiarity. It also offers a lesson in literary first principles - those "ways of looking and feeling" from the subtitle - that are the hallmark, and will be the legacy, of a very rare gift.
Recalling his difficult early days in London, Naipaul pinpoints the moment he realized that his destiny lay in seeing things, including the Trinidadian streets where he grew up, differently. For Naipaul, "the greater complication" of "exploring who I was and who the people in the street were" required that he originate nothing less than "another kind of writing."
"All my life," he says, "I have had to think about ways of looking and how they alter the configuration of the world."

Full text: With the interiors of Vancouver's top restaurants finally catching up to the quality of the food served, dramatic dining decors are making their way into the city's residential spaces
These mornings when I awake, I'm sad to report, it's totally dark. With autumn approaching, the light failing, and people muttering their valedictions to summer, it is perhaps the wrong season to trumpet Vancouver's emergence from its long and dorky design adolescence.
Regardless, Western Living magazine has just announced the winners of its "interior designer of the year" award. (Full disclosure: I was a judge in the competition.) It's being shared by David Nicolay and Robert Edmonds of Evoke International Design, and Juli Hodgson of Design/Build. All three have formidable portfolios in both restaurants and homes, but at the moment, their commercial properties are an incubator for their residential designs.
This trend is true of the broader industry: Features such as backlit onyx wall panels and oversized lights, once the preserve of lounges and hotels, have become commonplace in high-end homes.
The progress in commercial properties is good news for Vancouver. While it's never been hard to find a great meal in the city, until seven or eight years ago, it was hard to find a great room. Thanks to designers such as these three, our restaurant interiors are now catching up to our food.
Delilah's, a popular west-end restaurant, is a good example of the old Vancouver. From the mid-eighties to early nineties, the place seemed a dark New York secret everyone wanted to be let in on. Delilah's low ceilings, fresco cherubs, crystal chandeliers and velvet curtains were straight out of the final scene of a gangster movie - one that ends in blood, gunfire and spilt red wine.
Twenty years ago, that may have felt exciting; today it feels dated. Delilah's is one of many successful Vancouver restaurants that, design-wise, is losing step with the times.
For my money, Sanafir is the best room in Vancouver these days, and we have the team of Mr. Nicolay and Mr. Edmonds to thank for it. (Ms. Hodgson has done excellent work - notably on Goldfish Pacific Kitchen in Yaletown - but her hospitality portfolio doesn't have the breadth of the one built up by Mr. Nicolay and Mr. Edmonds.) Their design for the Granville Street restaurant, which opened in 2006, plays on a Middle Eastern theme, with soaring ceilings, textured walls and cascading displays of lanterns. Seating vignettes are separated by panels of gauzy fabric that operate like veils, offering privacy and, at the same time, flirtatious glimpses of your neighbours.
The men's innovations on the Vancouver scene have come not a moment too soon. With the arrival (at West Broadway's Lumière) of New York celebrity chef Daniel Boulud - the first genuine rock star cook to open a restaurant anywhere in Canada - and murmurings about possible local projects involving Gordon Ramsay and Jamie Oliver, Vancouver cuisine is set to make a gigantic leap forward. And we need quality design to match the food.
The architects and designers of Vancouver's next generation of top-flight restaurants would do well to follow the blueprint for success laid down by Mr. Nicolay and Mr. Edmonds, who are adept at intuiting the personality of a neighbourhood and designing a restaurant to suit it. Apart from Sanafir, they have wrought this success at two other neighbourhood-oriented restaurants in Vancouver.
Tangerine, the first, was born in Kitsilano in the mid-nineties, when Mr. Nicolay and some members of his family decided that the beachside neighbourhood lacked a cool hangout. Their remedy was to buy a shop front on Yew Street and make it over as a cozy, stylish place in which to enjoy a Saturday night cocktail or Sunday morning brunch. Before Tangerine, the street was a pastiche of greasy spoons and neglected ice cream parlours, with one good sushi joint and a bar where older, hard-drinking types partied the night away.
Tangerine refreshed the neighbourhood. Its interior was smart and playful, with an ivory bench along one wall, thick lacquered-wood tables, modern chairs, and whimsical drum lights wrapped in patterned browns and lime-greens. When the restaurant opened, it was an instant hit with the young families and professionals that populate Kitsilano.
On the other side of town, the two designers have set another blazing example: the Cascade Room. Opened in 2007, the lounge fast became central to the mood of Lower Main Street, an eclectic neighbourhood where upscale boutiques have sprouted up beside sticky-bun bakeries, vintage clothing stores and indie coffee houses.
Unlike Sanafir, whose downtown crowd prefers polish and poise, Cascade had to be a spot that would attract bohemians and professionals alike. For Evoke, effecting this artful mix of heritage and modern simplicity meant using familiar materials.
In the restaurant, the textures that assert themselves are the dark leather of the booths and rough-hewn wood of the ceiling beams. The effect is one of general rusticity pleasantly contradicted by modern touches such as the egg-shaped bar chairs. Other retro references give a nostalgic flair to the room and relate beautifully to the 1950s-style typeface used in the restaurant's menus and signage.
The design team has used graphics to infuse the room with the funk and whimsy of the streets beyond it.
Over each booth hangs a large drum light screened with a silhouette of Queen Victoria. And near the entrance, the crowning touch: a smoky-glass sign that urges patrons to "Keep calm and carry on." It's an existential reminder, no doubt, and perhaps also a suggestion to happy drunks on their way out into the neighbourhood.
Those of us excited by Evoke's strides forward might offer the same wish to Mr. Nicolay and Mr. Edmonds (as well as to Ms. Hodgson), as the future of restaurant design in the city glows ever brighter: Keep calm and carry on.

Full text: The neglected country home of a former Ontario senator could ring with sounds of Irish music, if enough money can be found
Right now, with windows shuttered, the stately old home can't help but look inward and remember.
Remember being built in 1932 by talented craftsmen using the highest quality materials; remember playing host to then-North York township's grandest parties, political meetings and even plowing competitions. In 1940, it began a new life as home to the Christian Brothers; in 1963, it watched the city's first Roman Catholic co-educational high school go up, and generations of kids swarmed its former grounds each September.
It's a rich history to review.
But when Maryvale, the country home of Liberal Senator Frank O'Connor (1885-1939), has its plywood blindfolds removed, what will it face? A crew wielding tools to gut its interior and an uncertain future in the hands of the Toronto Catholic District School Board (which once planned to demolish it to make room for a new high school that opened in 2005), or fresh life as a hub for Irish culture and learning?
When Mary Fay first laid eyes on the still-stately building at 60 Rowena Dr. four years ago, she knew instantly that she had found the latter.
"What struck me was this is the kind of place you would have liked to grow up in," she offers, a lilt in her voice. "This is when you're on holiday in Ireland and driving down the country roads and you look down the streets and, behind the trees, these lovely estate houses."
While still possessing lovely bones, the estate has suffered abuse from teenaged vandals and the indignity of having its utilities shut off, which caused floors to buckle, paint to peel and mould to grow. Nevertheless, in 2005, Ms. Fay and a handful of others could see a rich future as the O'Connor Irish Heritage House. They spent most of that year incorporating, selecting a seven-member board of directors (of which Ms. Fay is chair) and creating bylaws.
The next year, they applied for charity status and got down to the brass tacks of fundraising ("Process, process, all this stuff!" Ms. Fay says), because it falls to them to restore the large Colonial Revival-style home, accompanying coach house (with its pretty weathervane-topped cupola), and a small storehouse.
The school board, happy to find a group so dedicated, has promised a one-dollar-a-year lease in return.
More importantly, Ms. Fay's group has spent long hours learning about the successful businessman and philanthropist who, in the late 1920s, purchased 600 acres in the Ellesmere and Victoria Park area (nearby O'Connor Drive was named in his honour). As proof, she produces a photo album crammed with vintage photographs and newspaper clippings that tell the story.
Born to Irish immigrants in Desoronto, Ont., in 1885, Francis O'Connor left school at age 14 to work at Canadian General Electric in Peterborough. He moved to Toronto in 1912 with his wife, Belleville's Mary Ellen Hayes, and the next year the couple opened the first Laura Secord Candy Shop at 354 Yonge St.
Expansion across Canada and the United States (as Fanny Farmer Candy Stores) soon made them rich. While this allowed Mr. O'Connor to buy Maryvale Farm, which was named after their daughter, and to support political campaigns (for which Mackenzie King named him to the Senate in 1934), it also gave him a lifetime to "pay it forward" with many charitable acts.
In another photo album, a more recent yet equally inspiring story of efforts by the O'Connor Irish Heritage House group: fundraising days at the ball game and racetrack, the construction of a parade float modelled on the house, garden parties, Celtic events and even the production of a colouring book for children. So many new memories generated in so short a time; how many more could be created if the OCIHH had a headquarters for all this energy?
If the house does become that conduit, Ms. Fay promises it won't be at the exclusion of non-Irish members of the community. As she points to photographs of happy, multicultural faces engaged in some serious Irish dancing, she talks of a survey that has just been delivered to 7,000 area households asking for programming suggestions. With heritage houses in short supply in suburbia, not only should recipients fill these out and return them (or do it online at www.oconnorhouse.ca), they should jump at the opportunity to be involved with local history, if only to muzzle downtownies who lay claim to heritage bragging rights.
However, multiple deadlines loom. "We've got a time problem here," says Ms. Fay as she looks up at a gaping hole in the home's soffit and another beside the back door. "The longer this is not repaired, it's going to deteriorate."
And the longer repairs are put on hold, she adds, the more inflation will take a bigger bite out of her budget, which is itself facing a deadline. While the group has raised a fair bit of money and is working with many government officials (including Finance Minister Jim Flaherty and Toronto Councillor Denzil Minnan-Wong) to arrange for grants, it is still a long way from the $250,000 hurdle it must clear before the school board will hand over the keys. After Dec. 31, the board won't hand them over at all.
Despite the pressure, Ms. Fay says she wouldn't trade this experience for the world. "I came alive with this project," she says with an infectious giggle. "If, over the last three years, we stopped when everyone said, 'It's too much, it's too big, you're never gonna do it,' you know, you can't listen to that.
"This has become too important, because we discovered the Frank O'Connor story out of doing this ... and to bring it to youth, to give them something to be inspired by, so that we don't have anger, we don't have no goals, that was part of what I saw here."
Right now, the only way to uncover those windows and allow the O'Connor Maryvale estate to come alive with light, laughter and learning is, quite frankly, to open our pocketbooks.

Full text: The Shores
Location: Oakville
Builders/developers: Fernbrook Homes and Cityzen Development Group
Size: 675 to 2,600 square feet
Price: $329,000 to $2.25-million
Contact: To register, phone (905) 815-0009 or visit www.theshorescondo.com
Following the success of their Absolute community in Mississauga and Pier 27 on Toronto's waterfront, Fernbrook Homes and Cityzen Development Group have set sails for Bronte Harbour, where Bronte Creek meets Lake Ontario in Oakville.
The luxury condominium, called The Shores, will be set on a premium site overlooking the harbour.
"It'll probably be the last piece [of land] that has this type of water views," Fernbrook president Danny Salvatore says. "Seventy-five per cent of the suites have unobstructed water views."
Previews for the 10-storey building began last month. The builders anticipate high demand from local buyers hoping to downsize from low-rise properties.
Page + Steele Architects has given the building a glass exterior that curves toward the water, and stepped terraces that cascade down either side.
"What's unique about the building is that the facade resembles a huge cruise liner," Mr. Salvatore says. The Shores site is near the Outer Harbour Marina, Bronte Harbour Yacht Club and Fisherman's Wharf, as well as to public waterfront parks.
The site is steps from specialty shops, restaurants, large and small grocers and a shopping mall. In addition, there are golf courses and provincial parks in the vicinity, while GO Transit and the QEW are within easy reach.
The building will contain 200 suites measuring 675 to 2,600 square feet, with plans ranging from one bedroom to two bedrooms with a den. Amenities will include party and media rooms, a library, gym, rooftop patio, outdoor pool and hot tub.
Residents also will have access to 24-hour concierge, a guest suite and private wine storage, as well as ground-floor retailers.
Brian Gluckstein Design Planning Inc. has created the interiors in these areas, as well as in the individual units and model suite.
The 1,698-square-foot Cuddy model suite represents an average-sized unit in the building. The corner unit contains two bedrooms, three bathrooms and a living room divided from the cooking area by an island. With the exception of the formal dining room, every room has a walkout to a wraparound terrace measuring more than 650 square feet.
"It's reflective of the majority of the unit designs," Mr. Salvatore says.
Suites will have nine- and 10-foot ceilings in the principal rooms, fireplaces with stone mantels and surrounds in select rooms, and granite countertops in the kitchen. Flooring finishes include engineered hardwood, ceramic, porcelain tile, marble and 50-ounce broadloom.
Completing the homes will be laundry facilities, and bathrooms with marble countertops and undermounted sinks. Several units will feature large terraces; one, a 1,790-square-foot suite, has 3,396 square feet of outdoor space.
The monthly maintenance fee is 48 cents a square foot. Hydro will be individually metered. Parking will be included, with an additional spot costing $30,000.
Move-in dates are scheduled for early 2011.

Full text: The veteran sells $2-billion worth of suites a year, helping to create the fastest-growing residential downtown in North America
Bob Rennie doesn't fit the mould of a big-shot real estate broker, much less one of the most successful in North America.
He shows up for a breakfast meeting in running shoes. He is addicted to his BlackBerry, but he doesn't own a computer at home or in his office. Ultimately, he'd rather be known for his international art collection than real estate. Granted, he eats almost all his three meals a day in restaurants, and takes the wheel of a flashy Bentley when his driver isn't around. But he is chatty, goofy and frank, given to hugs even if he hasn't met you before, and he has the youthful energy of a kid on a candy high.
Donald Trump he's not. But you'd be hard-pressed to meet a Vancouverite who doesn't know Bob Rennie's name. The 52-year-old's celebrity is more a statement about the character of the city than the man himself. With some Vancouver luxury condos now selling at more than $2,400 a square foot, real estate is sexy business.
And with sales of between $1.2-billion and $2-billion annually, Bob Rennie Marketing Systems represents Vancouver's biggest condo projects: the Woodward's building, the Shangri-La (in both Vancouver and Toronto), the Residences at the Ritz-Carlton, Fairmont Pacific Rim, and the Olympic Village. His company's projects have also spread to Edmonton, Dallas and Seattle.
Mr. Rennie has worked extensively with major Vancouver developers Peter Wall and Ian Gillespie. Businessmen, politicians and lobbyists want his ear. To consumers and developers alike, he is a name brand.
"But it's all about the consumer," he insists. "Without the consumer I'm out of business, my client is out of business. So as long as I keep delivering, then our brand gets insured, and that brand should help the developers."
Mr. Rennie, who lives in a 3,000-square-foot condo penthouse in the hip downtown False Creek neighbourhood, also personifies what distinguishes the Vancouver real estate market from other North American cities. Vancouverites have made urban condo living a way of life, not merely a means to owning property.
"We have been, for the last 10 years, the fastest-growing residential downtown in all of North America, regardless of size," says Larry Beasley, former director of planning for the city.
"And that in part is because of the realization of an extraordinary opportunity by people like Bob Rennie to create a residential downtown. And for me and him, that's condos and rentals and everything that comes together to get as many types of people downtown as possible."
Mr. Rennie sells entire buildings, which works out to between 1,000 and 2,000 condo units per year. He makes a point of buying a suite for himself in each building - a little something for his three grown children's inheritance.
"More than 80 per cent of all sales west of Main Street are condos, so I picked the right industry," he says with a laugh.
"Condos became socially acceptable quicker here than in other cities," he adds.
Hemmed in by ocean and mountains, rapidly growing downtown Vancouver has nowhere to go but up. And with 2.5 million residents in the Lower Mainland, and the 2010 Winter Olympics about to push Vancouver further onto the global stage, the city is quickly developing urban areas outside the downtown core.
Mr. Rennie has long maintained that the only other direction for development is eastward, which means making the beleaguered Downtown Eastside district livable.
"Larry Beasley and I stood on a pedestal back in 2000, 2002, and said, 'The city's moving east,' " he recalls. "It didn't take a genius. It had nowhere else to go."
Mr. Rennie believes the province and the city will revitalize the gritty, crime-ridden Eastside in time for the Games, and if he believes in something, the public is sure to follow. When he threw his name on the project to turn the historic Woodward's department store on Hastings Street into a condominium, for example, 356 units were presold in a single day - an event credited with sparking the real estate boom in that area of the city.
Mr. Rennie comes from a working-class background (his father delivered beer) and grew up in a modest bungalow on the east side. He dropped out of high school just before graduation and began selling houses at age 19. (He didn't finish high school until 2006, when the school gave him his final credit for career development and marketing: he earned an A.)
By 1989, Mr. Rennie was already a wealthy man, selling a house a day, when he was approached by Dan Ulinder, a University of British Columbia professor of urban land economics. Mr. Ulinder asked him to help sell units at a condo-conversion development in Burnaby.
"I sold it in two weeks to all my clients' children," Mr. Rennie recalls. "It just sold out and Dan and I never looked back. I changed his life, and he changed my life."
Their entry into the condo market was timely. In the late 1980s, the city had put together a plan and changed zoning to increase downtown housing. As well, the market was ripe. "[New-home] developers were starting to make very little profit on the homes. It seemed a shift was going to happen," Mr. Rennie says. "It seemed time to diversify."
By 1992, the two partners had formed a company. Their pivotal break came that year when they took on sales of a 189-unit condo tower at 1188 Howe St., the earliest example of a local Vancouver company doing presales. (Mainly a Hong Kong marketing method at the time, presales involve selling units before construction is complete; the buyer doesn't have to pay the mortgage until the project is completed, during which time the property usually increases in value.)
Mr. Rennie and Mr. Ulinder sold out 1188 Howe St. in four hours - setting a North American record and putting their company on the map for condo marketing.
"That was the one that said, 'Wow, they can sell out a tower downtown,' " says Mr. Rennie. "It said to the banks, 'These are bankable.' It said to the development industry, 'These are salable.' And it started to pave Dan and I a career."
The two men later set another North American record when they sold out the 493-unit Residences on Georgia in a single day.
By 1997, Mr. Rennie had bought out Mr. Ulinder and formed Rennie Marketing Systems. (Mr. Ulinder, who went on to become a senior vice-president with Concord Pacific Group, died in 2003.)
Today, with a staff of 26, Mr. Rennie has moved beyond sales. He acts as a developer's representative and is involved in many aspects of projects, including concept, zoning, architecture and design.
"People let me play in their sandbox, and I don't take it lightly - it's a huge privilege," he says. "I'm just a very, very, very high paid consultant."
But he's a creative, big-picture guy, too, says Mr. Beasley, who has worked closely with Mr. Rennie.
"What he's doing most directly for his clients is he's shaping projects, he's marketing projects, he's causing them to move, and that's great. It's making a lot of people a lot of money," Mr. Beasley says. "Bob continues to be one of the strongest supporters for a much more sophisticated idea of the city."
Experts like Mr. Rennie and Mr. Beasley predict that post-Olympics, owning property within Vancouver city limits will be beyond the means of most people.
"I think that there is a huge emerging issue of affordability for average folks to live in the city," says Mr. Beasley. "I don't think any part of Vancouver is going to stay easily affordable."
Mr. Rennie agrees: "I think between now and 2015, that I would buy today."
But his interests go beyond the ins and outs of developing and selling real estate. Perhaps his most important message is to developers: the fact that people need not only homes, but also communities complete with stores and services and developed infrastructure.
"In a lot of cities they throw in condos but they forget we can't shop at Neiman Marcus and Holt Renfrew every day," Mr. Rennie says. "You need drycleaners, and you need to be able to pick up a loaf of bread."
That commitment to community is reflected in his own actions. An ardent supporter of Vancouver's culture, he pushes for more art, dance and theatre. He is also building offices and a 20,000-sq.-ft. art gallery in Chinatown to house his collection of the works of about 40 international artists, one of Canada's largest private collections. He doesn't plan to open his gallery to the viewing public, at least for the first few years, but says the collection is the sole reason he continues to sell real estate.
"I have an addiction, a passion for the art collection. If we are going to continue to build the collection, I have to continue doing what I am doing," says Mr. Rennie, who sits on the main acquisitions board for the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, as well as the American acquisitions board for the Tate Gallery in London.
He is also becoming more politically outspoken on social issues, giving speeches recently to developers and planners about the need for affordable housing. He cites working with the flagship Woodward's building as a personal and professional turning point.
"Woodward's came into an area with huge social problems and social housing issues," Mr. Rennie explains. "It's sort of my thing to try to figure out how to mix the people with jobs walking down the street, with the people without jobs. You can absorb the people without jobs by bringing balance to the neighbourhood," he says.
"A lot of people said, 'Don't do it, it will ruin your career.' Well, I think it's given me a new career."

Abstract: Right now, these U.S. banks have no ability to raise more capital; their share prices have been crushed, and confidence in them is close to zero. Some won't survive. But that will be of less concern to the next administration than the fact they won't lend. Don't be shocked if President Obama or President McCain sets up a taxpayer-funded corporation to absorb billions of dollars worth of bad loans. Like the Fannie and Freddie takeovers, it's a hell of a costly answer.

Full text:   Dr. Hank Paulson, oncologist and chief surgeon at Holy Mother of Credit Crises Hospital in Washington, D.C., removed the twin tumours of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac on Sunday morning. The patient, U.S. Economy, came through the procedure and awoke several hours later, complaining of pains in the wallet region.
The prognosis? Odds of a full recovery are good. But further invasive procedures are not only possible, but likely. Expect a protracted convalescence. In the long run, major lifestyle changes will be required - a debt diet, if you will.
Don't send cards, tulips or credit card applications, please (especially not that last one). Well-wishers, if they're so inclined, are encouraged instead to buy U.S. Treasury bills offering meagre rates of interest.
The good Dr. Paulson would greatly appreciate this, because as a creature of Wall Street, he surely knows this is not the end of the Street's calls on the U.S. Treasury. The nationalization of Fannie and Freddie may have been a necessary step - better now than to wait for their failure to precipitate a global financial panic - but it's still only a step. To get America's economy going again, its banks will have to begin lending again.
To persuade them to do so, the next U.S. treasury secretary, Republican or Democrat, may have no choice but to draw up a savings-and-loan-type bailout plan, to clean out the financial system. The last one, by the way, cost U.S. taxpayers more than $120-billion (U.S.).
This may seem too gloomy, but consider the history. The U.S. is hardly the first industrialized country to endure a modern-era housing bubble and collapse. Sweden, Norway and Finland all went through one in the late 1980s or early '90s. In each case, they got their economies upright only after the government had taken a grip on the financial sector, "in some cases seizing the assets of large commercial banks."
Those countries had small, relatively simple banking systems. The U.S. system is huge and complex. It's also a mess. Most of the problems are not in the big, troubled banks like Citigroup that have received so much bad press; they're in smaller regional or local banks. Gerard Cassidy, the veteran bank analyst who now works for the Royal Bank's U.S. brokerage unit, predicts 300 bank failures in the next three years.
Mr. Cassidy bases his forecast in part on something called the Texas ratio, a simple - but quite accurate - measure of how close a bank is to a financial cliff. It takes a bank's delinquent loans and divides it by the sum of its tangible capital and its allowance for loan losses. In English, that means: how much bad stuff is there on the balance sheet compared with what's set aside to absorb it? The healthiest banks have Texas ratios of less than 10 per cent. When the bad stuff equals the good stuff - a ratio of 100 per cent - history shows the bank is likely to fail.
No large U.S. bank is at that point yet. But a few are moving closer, and quickly. As of late July, 12 of America's 50 largest commercial banks had ratios of more than 25 per cent. In 2006, only one did. The list of the dirty dozen includes some important names. SunTrust Banks of Atlanta, which once had a bigger market value that Toronto-Dominion Bank, has a Texas ratio of 31 per cent. Wachovia, the seventh most valuable U.S. bank, has a ratio of 28 per cent.
So there's a lot of junk on those balance sheets, and while the feds' move on Fannie and Freddie will probably lower mortgage rates, it won't undo the bad decisions of the past. One side-effect of having so much competition - the U.S. has more 7,200 commercial banks - is that smaller banks tend to specialize. Pushed aside in the mortgage market by the likes of Countrywide Financial, they lent money to home builders or commercial developers, and that's where the next wave of losses is coming from.
Take Cincinnati-based Fifth Third Bancorp, a one-time starlet that's now No. 2 on Mr. Cassidy's list of banks with rough balance sheets. Mortgages and home equity loans are part of its problem. But Fifth Third also has 27 per cent of its loan portfolio tied up in construction, land development or commercial real estate projects, according to data compiled from various sources by National Bank Financial.
Fifth Third is by no means an anomaly; several other regional banks, such as New York's M & T Bank, have more than 30 per cent of their loans to real estate companies. Compare that to a better-diversified Canadian bank like RBC, where just 8 per cent of the loan book is business real estate loans. RBC's got residential mortgages up the wazoo, of course. It's just that most are lower-risk loans to Canadian customers who will pay the money back.
Right now, these U.S. banks have no ability to raise more capital; their share prices have been crushed, and confidence in them is close to zero. Some won't survive. But that will be of less concern to the next administration than the fact they won't lend. Don't be shocked if President Obama or President McCain sets up a taxpayer-funded corporation to absorb billions of dollars worth of bad loans. Like the Fannie and Freddie takeovers, it's a hell of a costly answer. Only the alternative seems worse.

Abstract: The current law says council "must approve" such appointments. Indeed it must, and will do so by the usual lopsided vote. Despite the hopes and claims of reactionary saboteurs, grabbing hold of "new powers" to do such things without consulting a compliant council is not part of the revolutionary agenda. The Mayor would like the right to meet with his executive in private prior to public sittings, cabinet-style, as recommended by all and sundry.

Full text:   As predicted, the victory of the revolution has removed the need for politics. The usual cacophony of the giant clam is stilled, debate forestalled and dissension packed off to a designated "protest corner" on AM radio, where it mingles with the electrical noise of streetcars.
The great victory took two elections and the better part of five years to accomplish, during which interval messy politics erupted regularly, but none can doubt the result today. The revolution that took so long to gain traction is now digging in. Apart from the workaday implementation of long-promised policy, there is nothing to report.
Remember that, every time you hear the words "Rob Ford." They are the touchstone of irrelevance, and these days you hear them all the time.
What you don't hear much any more, though, are the words "George Smitherman." The question of whether or not Mr. Smitherman will run against Mayor Miller is less important today than the question of why he - or any other popular figure - would do so. The revolution has monopolized the centre-left sweet spot of local politics, pushing its enemies to the margin where there is never more than 30 per cent of the votes available.
Thus the protest zone serves the revolution by creating a semblance of opposition. None but the losers play along, one of whom will almost certainly favour Mayor Miller by running against him in 2010.
Let a hundred flowers bloom and a thousand schools of thought contend. Just don't get your hopes up.
The real action is the implementation of dozens of initiatives launched in peril but now entrenched - climate change, priority neighbourhoods, streetcars and subways, tax policy and the waterfront. Such activity is confined almost entirely to council's "consent agenda" - legislation adopted without comment or debate, except when TV cameras and Rob Ford are present.
The most characteristic initiative is "Mayor's Tower Renewal," a plan to rehabilitate largely suburban high-rise neighbourhoods. Coming from outside the bureaucracy but now personally branded by Mr. Miller, the program is ambitious, inspiring and so diffuse as to be unknowable.
Remembering the tax-vote beating they laid on the Mayor last summer, opposition councillors are preparing for another battle over his expected demand for the new executive powers that the McGuinty government and two expert panels think he should have. They struck their colours, dug in - and disappeared.
They're still there, waiting for the Mayor to show himself. The problem is that he is too busy using his new powers to waste time and political capital fighting for them in public. Consider the recommendation that the Mayor gets the right to hire and fire the city's chief administrator. It's still a recommendation, but he just hired a new chief, former city treasurer Joseph Pennachetti - unilaterally.
The current law says council "must approve" such appointments. Indeed it must, and will do so by the usual lopsided vote. Despite the hopes and claims of reactionary saboteurs, grabbing hold of "new powers" to do such things without consulting a compliant council is not part of the revolutionary agenda. The Mayor would like the right to meet with his executive in private prior to public sittings, cabinet-style, as recommended by all and sundry. Just don't expect him to spill any blood.
If there is any drama in upcoming months, it will likely focus on Queen's Park, where fellow travellers in the McGuinty government could still cause trouble despite an otherwise solid alliance with the revolutionary regime. The Toronto Mayor continues to smile while Queen's Park delays fiscal relief promised a year ago, but that will change as the fiscal year winds down.
Gaining a "new deal" from the province - or at least the promise of it - was the revolution's definitive accomplishment. Without it, everything falls apart, beginning with hope for another so-called balanced budget.
Contract talks for city workers also threaten to disturb the peace. A new contract for the police is currently in arbitration, reducing its potential political impact even though the result will almost certainly be unaffordable. Negotiations with outside workers could help reveal more clearly who owns whom: labour-loving Mayor Miller or Miller-loving union boss Brian Cochrane. More likely, they will end with a friendly settlement.
It's the dialectic, don't you know, ruthlessly exposing internal contradictions while ensuring everyone can enjoy a good night's sleep.
Slate of issues
Toronto city council's first meeting of the new political season begins Sept. 24. The fall agenda includes:
* The Mayor's power push: David Miller wants greater sway over the bureaucracy and the ability to meet behind closed doors with his executive committee.
* Labour talks: Arbitration is already under way with the police and TTC unions. The inside and outside workers' contracts expire at the end of the year.
* Garbage changes: More trash angst is expected as the pay-as-you-throw trash regime officially kicks in Nov. 1.
* Union Station: The city is expected to select the real-estate arm of a pension fund to help finance a makeover for the transit hub.
* Transit battle: Metrolinx is set to officially release its long-term transportation plan.

Design with a West Coast edge

Abstract: The third influence on West Coast design is so pervasive it almost escapes notice: our cool grey light. It's the end of summer now, and our season of complaint about shortening days is just beginning. But it's not so much the amount of light we receive that designers need to correct for, it's more the tone and colour.

Full text:   The landscape, weather and cool, grey light are all factors in a style that's reshaping Canadian homes
I grew up on the Prairies, in Saskatchewan and Alberta, but the flatlands never really had traction in my imagination. From the age of seven, I'd importune relatives on the West Coast to take me in for the summer holidays. Those days, all I wanted was to feel beach sand underfoot. Today, as I look out at a Vancouver socked in steel-grey rain clouds, it seems a devil's bargain.
This is my first column for The Globe and Mail, so my editor suggested that, by way of introducing myself, I talk about a home that exemplifies West Coast design.
I was immediately worried. It's something like being asked to name a starlet who epitomizes Hollywood. You could point to Marilyn Monroe, who was of course a paragon of beauty, glamour and sensuality. But she was also, in her way, a sad, inadequate and avoidable cliché.
The Marilyn Monroe of West Coast design is a post-and-beam cedar home with soaring ceilings, fir-clad windows, slate floors and a granite fireplace - all located on a forested bluff overlooking the ocean, where from behind a cup of Lemon Zinger you can watch the sun set over tankers and seine boats plying the Pacific. But to focus on stereotypes is to miss a great deal of worthy detail.
In Vancouver architecture, for instance, that means the work of the firm Battersby Howat, whose modern concrete homes are unapologetically boxy. Instead of blending into the landscape, as is often prescribed on the coast, their structures jut out defiantly, creating a discord as intriguing as it is jarring.
Then there are the crafts-
man-style homes, whose sloping roofs, cedar shakes, and front porches hold great nostalgic appeal here, although there's little uniquely West Coast about them. The homes' origins are in the British (and then the American) arts and crafts movement, although local builders and architects are riffing interestingly on the classic design with signatures such as exposed cedar shake and white trim around black doors.
It's a mixed bag out here in the West, for sure. But if our designs aren't of a piece, at least I can point to three unique and immutable factors that give rise to the many variations we see.
The first is the landscape. The product of the grinding and buckling of tectonic plates and crashing of water, there is nothing gentle about the West Coast. It's a vista of violence, not of quietude and soft curve. Our topography is domineering, and, not surprisingly, everything in design orients itself toward the view.
The result is that a home's interior must be understated; it must make an effort to coexist with rather than confront the tumult of the view outside. For me, this means drawing on the colour palette of the surrounding landscape - its warm greys, dark browns and dirty greens, its ivories and myriad blues, rendered in limestone, concrete, walnut and oak.
A designer preserves the spirit of non-contention by sticking to tailored, simple forms. Bigger pieces such as sofas and tables make a statement with strong lines, enabling the curvature of accent pieces and chairs to soften the feel. I prefer to use things made from local materials and furnishings, wall pieces or sculptures by North Vancouver artist Brent Comber are my favourites. These originals, rendered in reclaimed lumber, speak to a distinctly West Coast ethic of refining the raw and elemental - but only slightly.
The second influence on design here is the weather. With our rain and mild winters, designers feel less compelled to define a rigid boundary as a bulwark between the living space and the out-of-doors.
The world beyond our window is always lush and green, and so we're freer to experiment with living spaces that fuse the natural and the domestic. One common way is stone floors that run seamlessly from interior to exterior, creating dining rooms that spill out to patios that give on to gardens.
The winter isn't as harsh for Vancouverites as it is for Winnipeggers or Torontonians, but the wet, in its way, can be as formidable an opponent as the cold. When the January damp sets into your bones, it stays there for weeks. So while West Coasters may not demand that their domiciles be bunkers from the elements, they require interiors that are tactile, sensuous and cozy.
From a design remove, this means liberal use of textured fabrics, window finishes, and bedding in inviting wools, linens and velvets.
The third influence on West Coast design is so pervasive it almost escapes notice: our cool grey light. It's the end of summer now, and our season of complaint about shortening days is just beginning. But it's not so much the amount of light we receive that designers need to correct for, it's more the tone and colour.
One mistake I see too often, even in Vancouver's most prestigious neighbourhoods, is bold, vibrant colours in interior and exterior applications - homes smeared in terracotta, ochre and canary yellow. These Mediterranean-inspired villas, which look wonderful in the penetrating glare of strong sun, look in Vancouver like some displaced daydream of a hotter climate. Our West Coast light is inhospitable to the lustre of deep colours - the flat grey of our atmosphere makes them look sickly and forlorn.
That's not to say colour has no place here, only that it be used subtly. Grey, brown and green form the foundation of the our palette, but there is a wide range of corals, purples, oranges and blues with which to accent and adorn.
I'm glad to have the opportunity to be your correspondent on the West Coast, and I'm excited to set to work, interrogating the people and exploring the ideas that inform design in this part of the world. I hope you'll check in from week to week, to see how the conversation is developing.

School's out forever

Abstract: Some advocates argue boards are short-sighted to close schools. "Across Canada in 2005, we saw the highest birth rate we've seen in 15 years," said Jessica Van der Veen, a Victoria-based advocate who is fighting B.C.'s large-scale school closings and land sales.

Full text:   A steady long-term decline in enrolment is closing schools across Canada, devastating communities and throwing the country's youngest students - and their parents - into turmoil
Katherine Randell already tears up as she looks ahead to tomorrow, when her eight-year-old son will rise at 6:45 a.m., eat breakfast, brush his teeth and catch a bus for his new 90-minute daily commute to school.
Instead of running home for lunch across tiny Woodstock in the northern reaches of Newfoundland, shy Kameron will eat a packed meal in a school gymnasium 35 kilometres away in Baie Verte.
Instead of the intimate school of five that allowed the Grade 3 student to excel at reading, he will study with 250 strangers.
When school is over for the day, the boy will take the bus instead of playing or walking home for a snack and homework. He'll arrive just in time for dinner and when he's finished eating and his assignments are complete, he'll go to bed.
"It's a big adjustment for him. We ask our kids to give up so much of their freedom. But I think it'll be an even bigger adjustment for me," Ms. Randell said.
"I'll be doing a lot of crying when I see him on the bus. I just wish I didn't have my baby going up there. I'm scared for him."
With only five students enrolled last year, regional officials may have had little choice but to close the Grades 1 to 4 primary school in Woodstock.
But the tiny school is on the leading edge of an anticipated cross-Canada wave of closings that promises to devastate small communities and throw the country's youngest students into turmoil.
Every province except Alberta is struggling with long-term declines in enrolment as the population ages and birth rates remain among the lowest in the world.
At least 53 schools closed in Canada this year, but advocates say that's just the beginning.
British Columbia and Saskatchewan lead the way, as they have for years, accounting for 19 and nine closings, respectively.
Most other provinces, including Ontario, have delayed some of the agony in recent years by putting a brake on closings as they figure out what to do next.
"In 2009, we're going to see a big surge of school closings right across the country," said Annie Kidder, executive director of People for Education, a parent-led research group based in Ontario.
"Everybody is dealing with declining enrolment, everybody is struggling with it. There's a kind of reality where some schools just have to close. But some provinces like Quebec and Saskatchewan are much better than others at looking for alternatives."
Thirteen schools closed in Ontario in 2008, but 77 schools are on a list recommended for closing. Most of them will be gone in June, Ms. Kidder predicted.
Canada is experiencing steady long-term decline in enrolment. The number of school-aged children dropped to 5.2 million in 2005-06, down 3 per cent from 1999.
Local school authorities and experts in most provinces say the decline will continue through 2013 and beyond.
With little national debate, the country is walking into an irreversible process that will leave dozens of communities in tatters, Ms. Kidder said.
"We have to decide as a society whether we're going to say, 'Oh well' and just keep emptying all these parts of the country," she said.
"It's a big public policy issue and it's a national one."
Migration within provinces from city cores and rural areas toward the suburbs is adding to the dislocation.
Even Alberta, with the only growing school population in Canada, closed 11 schools this year while opening 13 others to accommodate shifting populations.
Alberta plans to open 54 new schools through 2012.
Quebec has lost about 20,000 students each year for several years running. Enrolment last year was 872,384, down from nearly a million in 1994.
Denis Pouliot, a spokesman with the Quebec association of school boards, said few schools were shut down in 2008 after 37 of 2,744 schools closed in 2007. (A provincewide 2008 count of closed schools isn't done until this month.)
Quebec has likely experienced a lull in 2008 after the province imposed new rules demanding school boards look harder for alternatives and give a 12-month warning to local communities.
"People in these areas will do anything to keep their schools alive," Mr. Pouliot said. "The school is an important symbol for many communities and the government has tried to the extent possible to keep as many as they can open."
There is a downside to small schools, Mr. Pouliot said, listing off the psychologists, social workers, specialized teachers and socialization that are sometimes missing there. Quebec law demands all of these factors be measured before a school is closed.
While local authorities usually make the final decision to shut down schools, provinces set the rules.
Manitoba and Nova Scotia have moratoriums on school closings as they draw up new plans. Ontario recently emerged from a moratorium and about 125 schools are under review. Saskatchewan's rural depopulation has made the province a national leader in the field. It has closed 468 schools since 1970.
Helen Horsman, Saskatchewan's assistant deputy minister of Education, says closings may finally become a rare event rather than an annual source of anguish in her province.
After 23 schools closed in 2007 following a moratorium backlog, Saskatchewan introduced a new two-year process to fund communities fighting to keep their schools - provided they can show potential for economic growth.
"What we want to do is give communities every opportunity to demonstrate that they may be able to have a turnaround and encourage young families to move in," Ms. Horsman said.
"But even some areas with exceptional economic growth can't draw those demographics."
Ms. Horsman's former school in her hometown of Chaplin, west of Moose Jaw, is on this year's chopping block.
"Closing schools is one of the hardest things we ever do in a community," she said.
In recent years, B.C. has moved more aggressively to close schools than most provinces, with 177 shutting down in the past eight years.
It's ultimately a local decision, B.C. Education Minister Shirley Bond said in a written response to an interview request.
She stressed B.C. has boosted education funding and is pushing school boards to find alternatives to school closings and real estate sell-offs.
Some advocates argue boards are short-sighted to close schools. "Across Canada in 2005, we saw the highest birth rate we've seen in 15 years," said Jessica Van der Veen, a Victoria-based advocate who is fighting B.C.'s large-scale school closings and land sales.
"Any idiot can tell you the echo boomers are turning 30 this year and they're all going to start making babies immediately.
"The lack of planning is mind-boggling."
Quebec has been part of a recent small baby boom, but Mr. Pouliot said it's not nearly enough to make up for enrolment decline.
Ms. Van der Veen also points to the damage school boards are doing to vulnerable youngsters, some of whom spend 10 hours a week or more on a bus.
"In the B.C. Interior, some are busing three hours a day in all kinds of weather including snow and sleet because of this, and it's happening all over the province," she said.
"These communities have just been shattered."
Down the street from Ms. Randell's house in Newfoundland, Jonas Sacrey worries that the school closing may mark the beginning of the end for Woodstock.
Though the town's population has frequently fluctuated between 150 and 250 for the past 100 years and the school closed once before in the 1960s, he's pessimistic this time.
Mine closings and the dwindling fishery have left the town with retirees, unemployed people, seasonal workers who disappear for half the year, and almost no children.
Mr. Sacrey says local scuttlebutt is the four-classroom school, complete with gymnasium, will be sold at a bargain basement price. It would make a nice workshop, Mr. Sacrey said.
"We got a quaint community here, we got a nice draft from the ocean and a beautiful view," said Mr. Sacrey, 73, who raised two children in the village with his wife, Evelyn.
"We just don't have young people, and now, no school."

Full text: Not all water is created alike, and the difference could be damaging your system
Most homeowners only think about their water pressure when it suddenly drops - like when they're in the shower and someone flushes a toilet. Low water pressure is a common problem, and there are a lot of reasons for it - some small, some big.
If it's just at one tap, it might be that some debris and corrosion has flaked off inside your pipes and clogged up the faucet aerator. That's a quick fix that any handyman could do. But, if the problem is throughout your home, you should call in a licensed plumber to test your water pressure and check your plumbing.
Test the flow
Every municipality has a minimum flow rate that depends on where you live and the water source. (This applies to water taken from a municipal source, not a well.) That minimum rate is the flow that is delivered to your home, at the main water intake. After that point, all water pressure problems are yours - between the main intake and the street, it's the municipality's responsibility. So you may also have to call your local government and have it do a test.
Narrow supply line
In older houses, the supply lines from the municipality are smaller in diameter than today's standard, which will cause low water pressure. If the main water intake is only ½-inch pipe, you won't have good water supply throughout your home.
Undersized piping can't handle the flow demands of a modern household. You should have the supply line upgraded to ¾-inch minimum.
Corroded piping
A lot of piping is galvanized steel, not copper, and this is the reason for a loss of water pressure in older homes. Galvanized piping corrodes on the inside and deposits build up that block and can severely reduce the water flow.
It's a good idea to remove galvanized piping and upgrade to copper or Pex flexible plastic pipe. But this can be a very expensive job - and one for the professional plumber only.
Bad Plumbing
Another common reason for low water pressure is bad plumbing jobs in the past. Renovations or additions that altered the plumbing lines, or even some badly done repairs can create flow restrictions, and pressure drops.
An amateur or bad plumber can make a mess of your lines - using inadequately sized piping, with too many elbows, bad joints or supply lines taken off other lines incorrectly - creating what I call spaghetti plumbing.
Maybe it's in the water
Depending on where you live, the water that is supplied to your house could also be a problem. Some water is highly acidic or has a lot of dissolved minerals in it that can affect copper piping.
With galvanized piping, the problem is often "hard" water. Hard water contains higher levels of mineral content than "soft" water. Two of the most common minerals in water are calcium and magnesium.
Hard water from your municipal water system is perfectly safe to drink, but it can cause problems in pipes, appliances and fixtures.
Minerals can accumulate and look ugly - like a stain on a sink, for example, or something that looks like soap scum left in a tub. It's hard to clean, and it could indicate deeper, and more expensive, problems.
Hard water can leave a hard scaly surface that clogs the arteries of your pipes and inhibits water flow.
This can be a real problem for any appliance through which household water flows. Scaling and mineral build up can damage everything from taps to sinks, dishwashers and toilets. Eventually, scaling can interfere with the function of each of these things, and they have to be replaced.
Electric water heaters are especially vulnerable because hard water can build up on their heating elements, making them inefficient or burning them out completely. Even if you have a natural gas water heater, hard water scaling can reduce efficiency and force you to replace the water tank prematurely.
Hard water can also reduce the flow in showerheads and tap aerators. You can fix that problem by regularly removing the showerhead or aerator and cleaning out the minerals.
Water softeners
A simple remedy for hard water problems is to install a water softener. These appliances use sodium salt to help neutralize the minerals. The up-front cost can be a bit high, and there's the continuing cost of salt, but in the long run, it's going to be cheaper than replacing a dishwasher, a washing machine, water heater and faucets before their expected lifetimes are up.

Abstract: One of Toronto's most fashionable avenues in Victorian times, Jarvis Street suffered badly 100 years ago, when its wealthy residents decamped to nearby Rosedale. Great Gulf Group's X condominium, at the corner of Jarvis and Charles streets, will be a good tonic for its historically dilapidated neighbourhood.

Full text: Among the many new condominium buildings now poking their heads above street level, six are worthy of special note
A work of architecture begins its real-world career (as opposed to its life in the designer's mind and studio) as a hole in the ground. Downtown Toronto nowadays sports many of these muddy pits in the urban fabric. But not all holes are created equal. Here are a few important ones that deserve watching in the weeks and months to come.
590 JARVIS ST.
One of Toronto's most fashionable avenues in Victorian times, Jarvis Street suffered badly 100 years ago, when its wealthy residents decamped to nearby Rosedale. Great Gulf Group's X condominium, at the corner of Jarvis and Charles streets, will be a good tonic for its historically dilapidated neighbourhood.
The great modern master Ludwig Mies van der Rohe inspired the design by Peter Clewes and the late Adrian di Castri of the Toronto firm architectsAlliance, and the radical spirit of Mies is invoked in every crisp line and strict angle of the tower.
JARVIS AND ADELAIDE STREETS
Like X up Jarvis, Aspen Ridge Homes's Vü - its podium is now peeking out of the ground - is a piece of solid city-building. This dense complex of high-ceilinged lofts, townhouses and condominium apartments will be situated on the long-neglected east side of downtown. Or at least the district was neglected through much of the 20th century. Since the turn of this century, condominium blocks have been going up in the neighbourhood at a fast clip, and Vü will add substantially to the momentum of this residential revival.
The design is by David Pontarini, founding partner in the Toronto firm Hariri Pontarini Architects.
183 WELLINGTON ST. WEST
The luxurious Ritz-Carlton hotel and condominium tower is at a stage of construction that delights architecture aficionados: poking up above street level a few storeys, with all its massive concrete bones showing, and no cladding to obscure the craftsmanship of engineers and technicians.
Designed by the U.S. firm Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates and Toronto's Page + Steele Architects, the project will feature an urbane glass podium lifted smartly off the street by concrete columns. Behind this entry pavilion will rise the tower proper, its outer walls tilting outward with attractive flair.
330 KING ST. WEST AT JOHN
Just a few steps north of the Ritz-Carlton, the Bell Lightbox will be another tall tower in what's becoming a big cluster of them along King. It has been designed by Bruce Kuwabara of the well-known Toronto firm Kuwabara Payne McKenna Blumberg Architects, and it will house the famous Toronto International Film Festival Group and many condominiums up top.
If architects' renderings are anything to go on, the building will be bright and lively, and crowned with a glowing box illuminated from within by light-emitting diodes - "a vertical city of film," Mr. Kuwabara has poetically called it.
1 BEDFORD RD.
Out of this hole in the ground will emerge a tower with 32 residential floors that will likely add a touch of suave to the unsightly north side of Bloor Street, west of University Avenue. The scheme, also by Mr. Kuwabara, has had its share of tribulation.
A couple of years ago, you may recall, the muscular local citizens' group attacked H & R Developments and Lanterra Developments, whose project this is, arguing that grannies would be plunged into darkness by the tower, and so forth. The upshot was a decision by the city to shrink the building a little -not enough, thankfully, to blunt the contribution this tower will make to the streetscape.
When this building was being designed, I was bothered a bit by the architect's bowing to the preservationists and incorporating some scraps from the studio of beaux-arts designer John M. Lyle (the Royal Alexandra Theatre, Union Station), which once stood at 1 Bedford. It now appears that these bits and pieces will be integrated elegantly into Mr. Kuwabara's modernist etude.
325 BAY ST. AT ADELAIDE
When it's finished, Toronto architect Eberhard Zeidler's 60-storey Trump International Hotel and Tower will make this address in the financial district one of the swankiest in Canada.
The people living there will have access to all of the luxuries of the five-star hotel on the building's lower storeys. Cars will be parked by valets. For those who can't be bothered to own a car, the management will provide round-the-clock use of two chauffeured Mercedes. And there will be lots of room at the top: The penthouses will be a lavish 4,300 to 7,400 square feet in area.
I like the idea of this big dollop of ritz in the heart of the city. Along with many of the other holes in downtown Toronto, the one at 325 Bay will soon be filling up with residential architecture that adds value to being and living here.

Full text: Scugog summer house is a thing of beauty created by a man who believes that 'there's already too much ugliness in the world'
In James Mathias's summer house, Canadiana meets art moderne.
"It's a glorified cabin in the woods, but a cabin that I've tried to make glamorous," says Mr. Mathias, a Canadian artist who specializes in underwater photography from his home base in Fiji, where he lives much of the year.
Located in Scugog Township, less than an hour's drive northeast of Toronto, the modernist one-storey retreat with three bedrooms and two bathrooms is decorated with vintage Scandinavian furniture and Canadian antiques that Mr. Mathias chose for their natural materials and sculptural shapes.
Landscaped with lush flower gardens and boardwalks that wind through marshland where otters, deer and snapping turtles are in abundance, the house sports walls of picture windows that frame the natural beauty teeming outside.
Originally built in the 1930s as a fishing and hunting camp for members of Toronto's elite, the 90-acre property is dotted with elegant eastern white pines and artesian spring-fed ponds teeming with rainbow trout. (Mr. Mathias stocks the ponds but considers the fish pets.)
A typical vista brings to mind the elemental grandeur of a Group of Seven painting. Interestingly, the property does have an indirect association with that famous artistic fraternity.
Mr. Mathias is the adopted son of Gordon MacNamara, a painter who was a friend of Group of Seven member Lawren Harris. Father and son purchased the property in 1968 from Mr. MacNamara's sister, Dorothy Stark, who also was a friend of Mr. Harris and early patrons of the famous group.
The summer house contains furniture that once belonged to another Group of Seven member, J.E.H. MacDonald. The pieces include an old wooden painting table that Mr. Mathias has converted into a coffee table and put in the home's light-saturated sunroom.
A large Harris landscape painting dating to 1922 dominates a wall. The house also boasts artwork by David Milne and Mr. MacNamara, who died in 2006.
"It's not another world, but it's certainly a different experience," Mr. Mathias says of his country house.
"This is the one place I've created in Canada where I can relax, entertain and be with myself, alone and without the incessant noises of the city."
While its removed from urban life, the cabin exudes an air of urbanity, thanks to Mr. Mathias's unfailing eye for colour, form and texture in the way of home furnishings and art work.
"It's my only claim to fame," says Mr. Mathias, a natural-born aesthete who comes from inherited wealth and who has spent almost all of his 65 years pursuing the artistic life in North America, Europe and the South Sea Islands.
"I am always creating artistic environments for myself. I go into hotel rooms and rearrange the furniture. If I'm not comfortable, I'm not happy, and for me to be comfortable I have to be surrounded by beauty. There's already too much ugliness in the world."
He grills lamb chops in his spic-and-span 1940s kitchen with jazz music playing in the background.
He collects 1950s ceramics and sculptural Dansk ice buckets that he showcases on vintage teak tables, some of them scores from the local Salvation Army store. Over the years, he also has amassed an impressive collection of West Coast native argillite carvings, as well as historic Persona prints and traditional painted Tapa cloth from Fiji that he has framed for display.
His environment is richly artistic, but carefully edited to show off any given object in the best possible light.
"Mies van der Rohe had one motto - keep it simple - and that's how I live," Mr. Mathias says. "I really can't stand clutter. I need room for my collections to breathe."
To get it, he created an addition to the house in 1994 that now serves as a living room with a walkout to a terrace.
Crafted almost entirely by hand by local artisans, the addition is made of pine, with the walls painted a neutral colour. Dramatic hits of colour come from hand-woven kilims and Mexican rugs on the wood floors, and from Mr. Mathias's vibrant underwater photos that he has mounted on Plexiglas and inserted in some of the floor-to-ceiling windows.
He loves colour and loves his house as a result. "I will never let it go," he says. "There's something about a man owning land in Canada that makes him feel proudly and fully Canadian."
But while he has made an artistic statement on the interior, it is the exterior joys that really get his creative juices flowing.
"What turns me on about the house is just the peace and quiet," Mr. Mathias says.
"Listen to it. You can hear the fish jump in the water. You can hear the birds sing in the morning. For me it's not just a house, it's the outdoors. That's why the Harris looks so nice on the wall. It looks like it was painted here."
The studio building
Gordon MacNamara was an artist who was probably better known in his lifetime as the owner of the Group of Seven studio building on Severn Street in Toronto's Rosedale Valley.
He bought the Eden Smith-designed building in 1948 from his friend, Lawren Harris, who lived and worked there along with J.E.H. MacDonald and A.Y. Jackson. Tom Thomson, a marginal member of the group, once had a cabin in the backyard.
Upon his death in 2006 at age 95, Mr. MacNamara, a former lawyer, bequeathed the building to James Mathias, his adopted son, who now uses it as a pied-a-terre.

Full text: His book told mortal readers that time was limited
Dave Freeman was an advertising-agency executive who co-wrote 100 Things to Do Before You Die , a travel guide and ode to odd adventures that inspired readers and imitators,
"This life is a short journey," the book says. "How can you make sure you fill it with the most fun and that you visit all the coolest places on Earth before you pack those bags for the very last time?"
Raised on the eastern outskirts of Los Angeles, Dave Freeman was one of two children to a father who made his career in packaging and a mother who worked in real estate. After high school, he attended the University of Southern California in downtown Los Angeles. In 1983, he graduated with a degree in urban planning and briefly working for an ad agency in Newport Beach before moving to New York to work for Grey Advertising.
In New York, he joined forces with a Neil Teplica, a like-minded friend. In 1996, they started the website whatsgoingon.com, which they ran until 2001. The 100 Things book, which wassubtitled Travel Events You Just Can't Miss , arose from their work on the website.
The book's recommendations ranged from the obvious - attending the Academy Awards and running with the bulls in Pamplona, Spain - to the more obscure - taking a voodoo pilgrimage in Haiti, the Australian Night Nude Surfing championships and "land diving" in Vanuatu, which Mr. Freeman called "the original bungee jumping."
Another event high up on his own personal list was Las Fallas, a festival in Valencia, Spain, where the locals make large, satirical papier-mâché and plaster likeness of politicians and celebrities and then set them on fire. "Secretly, they're full of fireworks and dynamite," he said on U.S. National Public Radio. "At the stroke of midnight, they light them all on fire in a huge, loud pyromania display."
The book also included goofy graphics with each entry, indicating that some activities were "down and dirty," and others "grandma friendly."
The success of 100 Things inspired dozens of like-minded books, with titles such as 100 Things Project Managers Should Do Before They Die and 100 Things Cowboys Fans Should Know and Do Before They Die .
For Mr. Freeman, everything changed on Sept. 11, 2001. He was eating breakfast at his New York apartment when an airliner crashed into the World Trade Center, just blocks away. He climbed up to the roof of his building and from there watched another aircraft plunge into the second tower. Devastated by the collapse of the buildings and what he had witnessed, he later moved back to Southern California to be closer to his family.
In Los Angeles, he was hired by TBWA/Chiat/Day, an advertising agency where his job was to help clients take a fresh approach to their accounts. He also lectured on lifestyle trends. "[He was] amazingly fabulous at what he did, which was living big, but also as a business strategist and cultural anthropologist," friend Cyndi Yee told the Los Angeles Times.
Over the years, Mr. Freeman visited about half the places on the list, and either he or his co-author had been to nearly all of them.
"He didn't have enough days, but he lived them like he should have," Mr. Teplica said. this week

Full text: While other foreign players in corporate finance head for the exits, Edinburgh-based lender seeks to expand fledgling presence
Bank of Scotland is in the midst of setting up a corporate finance business in Canada, at a time when a number of foreign banks are scaling back or pulling out.
The Edinburgh-based bank, which is the second-largest in Britain measured by assets, plans to apply to the Minister of Finance for permission to establish a foreign bank branch in Canada.
Roughly a year ago, Bank of Scotland dispatched Andrew Darling, its European head of corporate finance, to Toronto to establish a beachhead in Canada.
From a tiny office of a couple of people, it has grown to a team of nearly 20, with ambitions to specialize in public infrastructure projects, some areas of commercial real estate, oil and gas, and mergers and acquisitions.
It has worked with real estate investment trusts such as Calloway on property investments, and with contractors such as EllisDon Corp. in bids for infrastructure projects. It has also partnered with other banks on financings.
But it has still barely made a ripple in Canada's corporate banking market, and isn't shy about admitting that it will likely be some time before it does.
"It really is from humble beginnings - building up some contact with local people, working very closely with local banks, Canadian banks, in partnership arrangements, and starting to do some modest amounts of local deals in the corporate finance area," said Mark Elliott, a spokesman for HBOS PLC, the bank's parent firm.
While the company's balance sheet exceeds $1-trillion, "in Canada, obviously, we're going to be very small, niche, targeted," Mr. Elliott said. "That smallness, it allows us the ability to stay there and to quietly do our thing. And that's what we did when we moved into markets like Germany and France in the mid-90s, when markets went soft then. And we just put two, three, five, six people on the ground. And now we have something like 200 people in mainland Europe working on corporate finance."
The bank has modest corporate finance operations in Germany, France, Spain and Holland. It has a presence in New York, and a sizable corporate bank in Australia.
Asked whether it wants to bulk up its Canadian team, Mr. Elliott replied: "I think in due course. I'd be lying if I said we didn't have that ambition." But, when the bank looks to a new location, it builds in increments, he said. "We really don't throw hundreds of people at a growth plan."
Bank of Scotland's Canadian expansion comes at a time when many foreign banks are retreating from North America as a result of the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis, and the infection it has spread through global lending markets.
Bank of America cut its Canadian corporate lending team in January. A number of banks, including Wachovia Corp., are evaluating Canadian businesses and deciding whether to part with them. And earlier this month, Netherlands-based ABN Amro Bank NV, which is now a part of Royal Bank of Scotland PLC, sold its Canadian commercial leasing division to Royal Bank of Canada, less than two months after ABN sold its asset-based lending business to Toronto-Dominion Bank. Royal Bank of Scotland is among the global banks that have been walloped by the credit crunch.
But Mr. Elliott said there is still intense competition in Canada, from both domestic and foreign banks.
"Even though there's been some uncertainty in the world economy, that doesn't mean that people aren't engaged in the Canadian market. They are. And, even in times like this, a bank like the Bank of Scotland is interested in trying to create some sort of niche place."
The key is that it will stick to its areas of specialty.
"That's the point," he said. "People aren't going silly. They're focusing on specific tangibles - tangible deals and tangible loans - that can stack up mathematically and will work. In this market, that's the name of the game."

Full text: Tiger Woods Dubai will be surrounded by 197 palaces and mansions, part of a massive theme-park complex known as Dubailand
Tiger Woods is already the world's top-ranked golfer and best-paid athlete. And if all goes according to plan, he'll soon be sporting his biggest trophy yet: a luxury golf course amid the sands of the Arabian desert.
The ambitious project, touted as the first course in the world designed by the 2008 U.S. Open champion, remains a work in progress on the outskirts of this Middle Eastern boomtown - much like the rapidly growing city itself.
But the project's chief said yesterday that the first phase of the development, which among other unlikely features promises five million square feet of locally grown grass and more than 30,000 full-grown imported trees, is on target for completion in the last three months of 2009.
"Our schedule is currently on track," Abdulla al-Gurg said in an interview with The Associated Press.
However, al-Gurg did leave the Dubai-based developer, Tatweer, some wiggle room in case the city's notorious work delays snag one of its most high-profile projects by adding, "Our key criteria is adherence to excellence."
Tatweer is a division of Dubai Holding, owned by the emirate and its ruler, Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum.
The golf course project, known as the Tiger Woods Dubai, will be part of a massive theme-park complex known as Dubailand the company is building on desert along the edge of the city.
Gurg said the company is spending four-billion dirhams ($1.09-billion U.S.) to build the course and the surrounding housing development.
He wouldn't say how much Woods was being paid.
Gurg spoke after an event to showcase the project at a glitzy beachfront hotel just down the road from a man-made marina surrounded by dozens of skyscrapers, many still under construction.
Full-page advertisements in Emirates newspapers have been trying to entice local buyers to consider one of the 197 palaces, mansions and villas that will flank the course.
The project's first stage will consist of the 18-hole, par-72 course, as well as a golf academy and a driving range. A hotel and most of the gated housing community should be finished by the second or third quarter of 2010, al-Gurg said.
Yesterday, Woods paid his first visit to the construction site since knee surgery in June sidelined him for the rest of the 2008 season. He said he didn't know when he might return to play next year.
"It's frustrating for me," he said when asked about the injury.
Woods didn't rule out defending his Dubai Desert Classic title, adding he plans to "be hitting golf balls at the beginning of the year."
Despite its dry, desert climate - the temperature yesterday hovered near 38 - Dubai is rapidly becoming a major golfing destination.
The city, which is banking on tourism to diversify its economy, hosts the Dubai Desert Classic and Dubai Ladies Masters each year.
Woods said he drew inspiration for his first course from clubs in the "sand-belt" golfing region near Melbourne, Australia.
"We want this golf course to play fast, quick," he said, while remaining appealing to a broad range of players.
Woods is not the only golfer laying out links in Dubai.
An 18-hole course designed by Colin Montgomerie was launched in 2006, and one by Ernie Els opened this year. Greg Norman, Sergio Garcia, Pete Dye and Vijay Singh are also working on courses scheduled to open this year or next.
Dubai developers have tapped other marquee names as well as they struggle to make their projects stand out in an increasingly crowded real-estate market.
Actor Brad Pitt has signed on to help design a hotel, while clothing maker Giorgio Armani is outfitting apartments in the unfinished Burj Dubai, already the world's tallest building.
Plans for Woods's course were made public more than a year and a half ago. But as the project and a number of other high-profile developments near completion, fears are growing that Dubai's soaring property market may be due for a correction.
But al-Gurg said he wasn't worried Dubai market concerns could make it difficult to fill the high-end houses around the golf course. After all, he said, it's not everywhere homeowners can say their backyard has been designed by Woods.
"The Tiger Woods Dubai is catering toward a niche market," al-Gurg said, adding that the developers were in no hurry, but were "focused on quality" to attract potential residents to the 197 exclusive housings.

Abstract: The only reason that the Juliet Creek development stands a shot at all is its success in allying itself with one of the local native bands, the Coldwater. Westscapes Development and the Coldwater have moved beyond the typically tired dance of business-native discussions - how much shall I pay to build a cultural centre? - arriving at what looks to be a fully formed partnership. The band will get a 10-per-cent equity stake, a seat on the board and a share in whatever real estate parcels are developed.

Full text: The huckleberries and blueberries on the slopes of the Nicola Valley are hitting their juicy peaks this month, making it prime picking time for the Indian bands up and down the undeveloped stretches that gird the modern Coquihalla Highway running to the B.C. Interior.
Those succulent berries are much more than a sweet treat. They are ripening into a point of conflict between those bands, and companies yearning to develop the valley's tourism potential.
Drive the mountain motorways of the Coquihalla - a spectacular trip in summer, however nerve-wracking in winter - and two things are striking, beyond the spectacular vistas. One is the swaths of dead red pine, the carnage left behind by the pine beetle. And the second is the complete lack of any significant enterprise that can make up for the economic devastation caused by the beetle, and resulting evisceration of the forestry industry.
Enter the resort industry, and seemingly common-sense plans to build a skiing and golf complex, the Juliet Creek Resort, near the Coquihalla Summit. Westscapes Development Inc. of Vancouver is proposing a facility with a base area of 200 hectares, able to handle 7,000 skiers a day, and for summer, an 18-hole golf course. There would also be a village, including 2,500 dwelling units. All told, the project would cost $2-billion, and create hundreds of construction jobs, not to mention the permanent jobs at the resort and associated retail businesses.
The complex would be just a two-hour drive from the Lower Mainland, assuming astonishingly nasty mountain winters aren't slowing down the trip. The location is superb, the economics make sense. The problem? Those huckleberries and blueberries.
The area in which the resort is to be built also happens to be among the best areas for picking berries, as well as a spiritually important region. In British Columbia, those kinds of claims are typically a death sentence for economic development. The lack of any broad progress on settling land claims has created a legal miasma that aboriginal bands have deftly turned to their advantage time and again, aided by a string of Supreme Court decisions. No court has yet granted natives a veto over economic development, but they are exercising it nonetheless.
The only reason that the Juliet Creek development stands a shot at all is its success in allying itself with one of the local native bands, the Coldwater. Westscapes Development and the Coldwater have moved beyond the typically tired dance of business-native discussions - how much shall I pay to build a cultural centre? - arriving at what looks to be a fully formed partnership. The band will get a 10-per-cent equity stake, a seat on the board and a share in whatever real estate parcels are developed. In return, the company gets the support of the band most affected by the resort and, more important, the ability to fend off the demands of other bands. Despite the Coldwater band's agreement, several other bands are not dropping their opposition, including the Shackan, who live 70 kilometres from the proposed site - 25 kilometres farther away than the Coldwater.
Grand Chief Percy Joe of the Shackan says his people have used that site for centuries to harvest berries and to perform spiritual ceremonies, and don't want to see the area despoiled. His demands are stark. No resort, of any size, now or ever. No deal with Westscapes, even if the project is ultimately approved. "I don't want anything from them and I'm not giving them anything," he says.
Contrast that with the stance of the Coldwater, who say they proceeded in their negotiations with Westscapes as if they owned the land that will be the site of the future resort. They do not have legal title, but claim the area as traditional lands - as do the Shackan, and others. The resulting thicket of land claims, counterclaims and questionable assertions makes the tangle of a huckleberry bush seem positively tidy.
Will the support of the Coldwater allow Westscapes to avoid the development limbo that other proposed resorts in the B.C. Interior have drifted in for years, even decades? The band's backing combined with the economic pressures of the pine-beetle disaster could make the difference, and tilt the balance toward jobs and growth, instead of a month of berry-picking.
And that would only be fair. After all, it was the first wave of economic development in the Nicola Valley - decades of logging - that cleared the way for all those luscious berry patches.

DQI Design Quorum Inc. says its latest low-rise development offers home buyers an opportunity to live in a small town where they can walk to most amenities yet be close to Georgian Bay and other recreational attractions in the area.
"There are lots of projects that are out in the middle of an apple orchard somewhere, but this is right in town," DQI president Jonathan Sprawson says of Millpond in the Village in Thornbury, which is about a two-hour drive from Toronto. "You can leave your car and you don't have to drive anywhere."
It's a five-minute walk from the site to shops, restaurants, schools and parks. The harbour, marina and the Georgian and Bruce trails are easily accessible, and it's just a short drive to some of Ontario's best golf courses and ski slopes.
The infill project will offer 27 luxury condominium townhouses close to Thornbury's downtown core. More than half of the units will back on to a scenic mill pond, which will be fit for swimming, fishing, and boating in non-motorized crafts such as canoes and kayaks.
"There are some houses - but no new houses - on the mill pond," Mr. Sprawson adds. "When you stand on the pond and look across, you'd swear you were somewhere in Muskoka."
Almost half of the units are designed for single-floor living.
Since the site already has water, gas and cable service, construction has started on the first batch of homes. This means buyers can move into units on King Street by December and waterfront units in April.
Exteriors will feature prefinished wood siding and Saratoga stone, covered porches, carports for two vehicles and oversized windows.
Currently, three-level plans are being offered. (One-level plans will be unveiled Aug. 30.)
Homes will have two or three bedrooms, open-concept principal rooms, more than 14-foot cathedral ceilings in some models, and 280-square-foot rear decks with privacy screens.
Flooring materials include natural stone, porcelain tile, prefinished solid oak hardwood and low-pile carpeting. Among the other features are pot lights, 7¼-inch upgraded baseboard and oak hardwood stairs to the second floor.
Buyers can customize their homes - making them wheelchair accessible for instance.
High-speed telephone and TV cable ports will be installed in certain rooms, and there will be rough-ins for central vacuum and security systems.
The builder's "green" practices will include using local suppliers, and planting indigenous species around walkways and in gardens to complement existing trees.
Energy Star appliances will be standard in kitchens and laundry rooms. High-efficiency gas hot-water tanks and natural gas climate-control systems, including forced-air heating and air conditioning, will be installed.
Exterior maintenance, grass cutting and the removal of snow and garbage will be covered by a fee estimated at between $150 and $200 a month.

Full text: The threatened demolition of the 77-year-old Heatley Block in Strathcona pits residents against the Vancouver Public Library
It was no accident that Heritage Vancouver included the 1931 Heatley Block in Strathcona on its annual list of top 10 endangered historic sites in the city. In fact, it was the opening salvo in a fight by heritage experts and residents to save a valued site in a heritage neighbourhood.
It's a battle that highlights the tensions between old and new in one of Vancouver's oldest districts - and pits citizens against the board of the Vancouver Public Library.
Two months ago, the city's real estate department bought the commercial block at the corner of Heatley and Hastings, along with two adjacent houses dating to the late 19th-century, with a view to redeveloping the site for a new branch of the Vancouver Public Library.
Don Luxton, president of the non-profit Heritage Vancouver, says that he heard about the possible purchase early in the year, and that including Heatley Block on the endangered list in March was a deliberate attempt to save the property from demolition.
"There were rumours that the building would be demolished for a new library," he recalls.
"When we evaluated the site, it was clearly of heritage value to the area, and obviously at risk, as it is not listed on the city's Heritage Register. So it was included at the last minute as one of our top 10 sites."
The village-like Strathcona neighbourhood, tucked between Chinatown and the Downtown Eastside, is home to some of Vancouver's oldest buildings.
Its residents have fought to protect the area from redevelopment since the 1960s, when they halted construction of a major highway that would have eradicated both Strathcona and Chinatown.
"Strathcona is known as Vancouver's first neighbourhood," Mr. Luxton notes.
"It was part of the very earliest settlement of Vancouver and provided housing for many people who worked in the downtown and in the port area."
Once known mainly for crime and drugs, Strathcona is now a neighbourhood in transition, a mix of artists, ethnic groups, and young professionals drawn to an urban lifestyle in an arts-and-crafts home.
The area is remarkable for its intact rows of late 19th-century and early 20th-century architecture, unique to the city. Many of the houses have been painstakingly restored by their owners.
Although Strathcona is just a stone's throw from the gritty Downtown Eastside, earlier this year it saw its first $1-million-plus home sale, a sign of the area's growing popularity.
John Atkin, an expert on Vancouver history and head of the Strathcona Residents Association, says that because the area is experiencing significant change, it's crucial that city officials look at long-term plans for heritage buildings such as the Heatley Block.
"The city didn't do its due diligence," says Mr. Atkin, author of several books on Vancouver heritage.
"They didn't take a look at the complex and say: 'Two old heritage houses and a character building ... hmm, this might mean something to the community. We should do some checking.' "
The Vancouver Public Library does see the value of the Heatley Block, specifically its location. Officials say the site is the perfect spot for a new, 12,000-square-foot branch library that would also offer services such as English classes and employment training.
But those ambitious plans would mean demolishing the two-storey Heatley Block, which has apartments above four stores, along with two neighbouring houses - among the oldest in the city - dating to 1889 and 1898.
"The people who live [in Heatley Block], the majority, feel very passionately about wanting to stay there," says Claudine Michaud, head of a hastily organized residents' group, the Heatley Block Preservation Society.
"It's got tons of character and it was well kept by the owners," she says, adding: "The way this purchase was done, it was very much below the radar."
The residents' group has papered Strathcona with posters to save the Heatley Block and acquired about 800 signatures on a petition, which it presented to the city.
The Vancouver Public Library has been working toward a new branch in the area for several years. In 2004, Ms. Michaud took part in community consultations on the subject.
"What came out of that was to place a library as close as possible to Strathcona Elementary School," she recalls. "And also, no heritage buildings would be demolished in order to build a new library."
A year later, the library's board of trustees received financing to spend $2.5-million on purchase of land for a new branch, but does not yet have money for the building itself.
The VPL wants to build a branch that would serve Strathcona, Chinatown and the Downtown Eastside. Currently, residents use a 1,500-sq.-ft. library inside Lord Strathcona Elementary School on East Pender Street; the school's library, complete with tiny chairs, doubles as a VPL branch.
Heatley Block supporters argue that the ideal location for the library is on the grounds of Lord Strathcona; it is the city's oldest school, is attached to a community centre, and is already familiar to residents as being the site of the public library branch.
"If the new library branch were situated there, it would become a central hub for the whole area. Everything already takes place there," Mr. Atkin argues.
Shannon Daub, a trustee of the VPL and chair of its community relations committee, sympathizes with those who want to safeguard the Heatley Block and the 19th-century houses.
"If there were a development in my neighbourhood where we felt like we were going to lose one of our few valuable buildings, I would have concerns too," says Ms. Daub, who works in the heritage Dominion Building downtown and regularly cycles to work through Strathcona.
"But as trustees, we work with the community consultation process and the city's real estate department, and I understand the search for the site was quite challenging," she says.
"We were quite excited when we heard we had a site, and frankly, we weren't aware that there were [heritage preservation] concerns with Heatley Block at that time. But we want to address those concerns," Ms. Daub says.
To that end, city and library officials met with residents' and community groups earlier this month to talk about the plans and will get together again next month.
City librarian Paul Whitney says there is also a plan to do a "statement of significance" on the heritage aspect of the Heatley Block and the two smaller buildings, examining their architectural value as well as their worth to the community.
Mr. Atkin says that's welcome news for the Heatley Block - and for residents of Strathcona.
"It's quite a good thing, because it will give everyone something to measure the building with. All of this comes about because of what the residents have said."

A brief history
Here is how Heritage Vancouver described the Heatley Block in its 2008 Top Ten Endangered Sites report:"The Heatley Block, a well-loved Strathcona landmark, houses a cluster of local businesses cherished by the neighbourhood.
The main structure, built in 1931 at the southwest corner of East Hastings & Heatley, is a stucco-clad commercial/residential building. A handsome example of vernacular commercial architecture, the structure is remarkably intact, with pressed metal cornices, crenellated parapets, divided double-hung wood sash windows, original signage and decorative details.
The building contributes to the historic fabric of the neighbourhood as one of the last remaining character buildings on a particularly bleak section of East Hastings.
On the same property, but around the corner at 405-419 Heatley are two very early houses. Covered with asbestos siding, one of the houses, with an intact Victorian bay window, dates from 1889."

The heritage register
The Heatley Block and two 19th-century houses under threat of demolition in Strathcona are not listed on Vancouver's Heritage Register. While their omission raises concerns for many, it doesn't surprise local experts.
The register, compiled in 1986, is the backbone of the city's heritage program, says Don Luxton, of the non-profit group Heritage Vancouver.
When a building is placed on the register, it is flagged as having heritage significance. It is not legally protected from demolition, but demolition can be delayed, allowing for negotiation to save the building if it is proven to be of significance. Buildings that are not on the register have no such protection.
The register has not been updated in the past 20 years and overlooks many historic buildings and sites, Mr. Luxton says. For the most part, a building is added to the register only when its owner does so voluntarily.
"Heritage Vancouver has been calling for many years for an update of the Heritage Register," Mr. Luxton says. The question of how to do that is linked to other heritage initiatives that will go before City Council on Oct. 2; his group will be on hand to push for the update.
"The Heritage Register is a pointless document now," agrees heritage expert and author John Atkin. "It was [first] done as a 'windshield survey' by people who drove across the city looking at buildings that could possibly be heritage. The idea ... was to capture a good sense of what was out there, but then it would be refined into a much more detailed list. And then the list was never modified from that general catchall. Great whacks of stuff got missed the first time."

Full text: With food costs rising, more homeowners are foresaking the green lawn for home-grown organics
More families are looking right under their feet to ease the problem of high food prices.
As consumers balk at the rising cost of groceries, homeowners increasingly are cutting out sections of lawn and retiring flower beds to grow their own food. They're building raised vegetable beds, turning their spare time over to gardening, and doing battle with insect pests.
At Al's Garden Center in Portland, Ore., sales of vegetable plants have jumped an unprecedented 43 per cent this season from a year earlier, and sales of fruit-producing trees and shrubs are up 17 per cent. Sales of flower perennials, on the other hand, are down 16 per cent.
It's much the same story at Williams Nursery in Westfield, N.J., where total sales are down 4.6 per cent even as herb and vegetable-plant sales have risen 16 per cent. And in Austin, Tex., Great Outdoors reports sales of flowers slightly down, while sales of vegetables have risen 20 per cent over last year.
The grow-your-own trend comes as the price of food has skyrocketed - a reflection of global pressures, from drought in Australia to increased demand in India and China.
For Michele von Turkovich in South Burlington, Vt., those pressures hit home when she noticed her average grocery bill hit $800 (U.S.) a month. "I reached for the organic strawberries the other day and realized, 'I can't buy organic,' " says the research-lab technician and mother of three teenage daughters.
After chatting with a neighbour who has a large garden, Ms. von Turkovich decided in April to dig up a 10- by 12-foot patch of lawn struggling on the side of her house to plant vegetables. Her neighbour helped her to think about making the best use of the space so that there would always be something in the garden to harvest.
She has lettuce, radishes and about a dozen varieties of greens, including Swiss chard, kale, scallions and endive. A used soccer net serves as a makeshift trellis for the peas. It's a lot of toil, though. Ms. von Turkovich says she typically spends at least an hour after work each day on her garden and about half the weekend. "It takes a significant amount of my spare time."
Even before this year's food-price crunch, the vigour for veggies was already gaining momentum. An annual survey of more than 2,000 American households by the National Gardening Association shows the average amount spent per household on flowers was flat in 2007, compared with a year earlier. But spending on vegetable plants rose 21 per cent to $58 a household last year, and spending on herbs gained 45 per cent to $32.
Bruce Butterfield, the association's research director, expects 2008 will be another strong year for vegetable gardening thanks to "the combination of gas prices, food prices, and people staying at home because the world's gone crazy," he says. "At least they can have some control over their backyard."
George Ball, chief executive of seed giant W. Atlee Burpee & Co. in Warminster, Pa., says he thinks the veggie-gardening rage is prompted by more than just food costs. He's seen more baby boomers "entering their prime gardening years," he says. Now, this generation has "a lot of time, the rat race is over, a home that is likely to be their last, and kids past puberty," he says.
Burpee's sales of vegetables and herbs are up about 40 per cent this year, twice last year's growth rate. Tomatoes, summer squash, onions, cucumbers, peas and beans continue to be top sellers.
"We're running out of things like onions, that you think would never be that hot and raging," he says.
In West Columbia, S.C., Sarah Rosenbaum ripped up about a quarter of her landscaped yard to install six raised vegetable beds. "You get a pack of seeds for a dollar or two, and you have got a whole bed of organic vegetables for a fraction of what you'd pay at the store. And they taste better."
The project got under way in early March when Ms. Rosenbaum, her partner and his 12-year-old twins started seeds indoors for all their vegetables - from bok choy to zucchini.
"We're out in the garden after work every day, pretty much. We love doing the work, so it doesn't really feel like work." She hopes the experience will also inspire the twins to eat more vegetables.
To be sure, a new gardener can find himself plunking down a significant amount of money to get started. Ms. Rosenbaum says that the initial investment in her vegetable garden was around $500 for everything from lumber to wire cages. While that may seem high for someone trying to save on food costs, she plans on reusing the materials year after year. "We're even planning to save seeds for next year," she says.
In the Garden Grove neighbourhood of Portland, Ore., a community garden got a big makeover. Not only did the 15 participating households decide to double the garden's size and install a rain-sensitive sprinkler system; they also set aside a section so that each family gets its own subplot.
"I'm in no way a tie-dye wearing granola hippie," says Garden Grove resident Dylan T. Boyd, a vice-president at an e-mail marketing company and father to two small boys. "But I was looking at the price of blueberries the other day - $5 for a fistful. I thought, 'Are you kidding me?' "
While it's a time commitment, he says, the payback is huge. "It's so much easier to walk to the top of the street and grab your lettuce and tomatoes for dinner, fresh every day."
Talk to your local nursery or check the seed packet for instructions on ideal planting times, which vary depending on where you live. Here are some other things to consider:
Soil testing
If you live near an industrial plant or even in an old house where lead-based paint may have seeped into the soil, you should consider getting the soil checked for contaminants. If you build a separate or raised bed filled with compost and topsoil, you can forgo testing the soil you're worried about.
You can also buy a soil-testing kit at a garden centre that will tell you the pH and key nutrient levels. Optimum pH for growing vegetables is generally slightly acidic (between 6.5 and 7). If you don't have enough nitrogen, phosphorous or potassium you should add organic matter, such as good compost mixed in with your existing soil. Also consider organic fertilizers to boost those nutrients, such as blood meal, alfalfa meal, sea kelp or fish emulsion.
Best conditions
Most vegetables do best when they get plenty of sun, so pick a spot that gets optimum sunlight, at least six to eight hours of direct sun daily. Leafy greens such as lettuce and spinach can tolerate shadier conditions.
Also, those leafy vegetables typically want to be planted in the cooler part of the season, before average temperatures go much past 21 degrees. Vegetables that do best in the hotter months include tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers and squash.
To conserve space, consider planting lettuce underneath tomato vines or even mixing them in other parts of the garden, where the foliage, vines and flowers can be captivating in their own right.
"Sometimes people think they have to be in perfect rows, but there's no reason you can't put them in a little closer and mix them in with flower gardens," says Lori Bushway, a gardening specialist at Cornell University.
Think before you spray
If you see a pest, find out what it is before reaching for that scary-sounding spray can. "People are buying sprays without even knowing what the problem is in the first place," says John Traunfeld, director of the home and garden information centre at the University of Maryland's college of agriculture and natural resources. "A lot can be taken care of by just hand picking," he says.

Full text: Georgeville, Que., is a hyper-quaint little spot on the eastern shore of Lake Memphremagog in the Eastern Townships.
The 200-plus year old Loyalist village boasts many appealing touristic qualities, including an upscale auberge with an ambitious wine list that is the oldest continually operating hotel in Canada. And now a fully restored general store -thanks to Paul Desmarais Jr.
According to local residents, Mr. Desmarais has spent some cash (the amount rumoured is $250,000) in the past year on landscaping and gentrifying the interior of the historic building, and he has installed a young couple to run it for him.
No, the Power Corp. scion is not going into the grocery business.
Rather, it seems, he is protecting the calibre of his summer home environment - he owns a large shoreline estate on the lake.
It's not the first time Mr. Desmarais has dabbled in the local economy.
He also founded (with former BCE honcho Jean Monty ) an exclusive members-only golf club in the area.
Mojito Perks
Brookfield Properties owns the top have-to-be-there office space in Toronto - the twin towers of Brookfield Place.
The skyscrapers are home to the likes of Onex and Merrill Lynch.
Office space there is so sought after that there's a waiting list to get in.
So one would thing that the owner, also Canada's biggest real estate company, could afford to rest on its laurels.
Yet recently, on one of Toronto's rare sunny afternoons, what do we see Brookfield Place doing for tenants? Handing out free mojitos, margaritas and cosmopolitans to white-collar types. The two-day promotion had attractive twentysomethings pouring Smirnoff cocktails into dainty plastic martini glasses for four hours at a time, with a predictably appreciative crowd gathered round. No word on how office productivity in the towers was affected after a few rounds of lunchtime mojitos.
Sabia's New Gig
Michael Sabia, BCE's former chief executive officer, has a new post, albeit not a corporate one. He was recently named as chairman of the new Canadian HIV Vaccine Initiative (CHVI) Implementation Advisory Board.
That organization is the Canadian player in the Global HIV Vaccine Enterprise, which aims to speed up the development of preventative HIV vaccines.
The Canadian board is made up of prominent figures from business, philanthropy, public policy, scientific and non-governmental sectors.

Full text: Newfoundland and Labrador Premier Danny Williams is about to announce a long-delayed agreement with a consortium of oil companies to proceed with the Hebron offshore oil project, a $5-billion deal that will pump more fuel into the province's economy.
The Hebron project had sparked a war of words two years ago between Mr. Williams and U.S.-based multinational oil companies over the Premier's insistence that the province receive a 4.9-per-cent equity stake in Hebron.
But last summer, the two sides signed an agreement-in-principle - just ahead of a provincial election call - that would see the province spend $100-million for its equity participation. Mr. Williams has since insisted that the province will take at least a 5-per-cent stake in all future offshore developments, including an extension of Hibernia, Newfoundland's first offshore oil project.
The blunt-talking Premier had expected a final agreement earlier this summer, but negotiators now face a deadline of Thursday, when the year-old initial agreement expires. Officials had been planning for a possible announcement yesterday, but got bogged down in the fine print. An announcement could come as early as tomorrow after the deal is formally put to the provincial cabinet today.
"There was nothing that could be called a true sticking point," one industry source said. "It's just a matter of knocking down each element of a very complex agreement."
However, other sources said negotiations dragged on longer than expected over production timetables and the province's buy-in schedule, which is tied to production. Hebron is expected to produce some 200,000 barrels a day of crude oil, equivalent to twice the typical oil sands expansion project.
Chevron Corp. is the project operator and owns 28 per cent of it, while Exxon Mobil Corp. is the largest shareholder with 37.5 per cent. Petro-Canada and Norway's state-owned StatoilHydro ASA own the rest. Chevron sparked rumours of a pending final deal earlier this summer when it re-leased office space, returning in numbers to St. John's for the first time since disbanding the Hebron project team in 2006.
The government's stake in Hebron - and all other oil projects - will be held in a subsidiary of Newfoundland and Labrador Hydro, which is now charged with taking an active role in the development of the entire spectrum of energy resources in the province.
Prior to last year's signing of the agreement-in-principle, Mr. Williams faced criticism at home - and across the country - for delaying the development and putting the province's economy at risk.
While the economy has slowed this year, there are unmistakable signs of optimism, including a red-hot real estate market in St. John's, and forecasters expect growth to pick up substantially in 2009, as projects such as Hebron gather steam.
Local manufacturing and service industries are expecting major work at Hebron, though business leaders are eager to see whether Mr. Williams bargained away local content rules in exchange for the right to take an equity position in the project.
Jerry Byrne, chairman of St. John's-based metal fabricator D.F. Barnes Ltd. and past-chairman of the Newfoundland Ocean Industries Association, said local employers are brimming with confidence.
"We're all obviously pretty excited when there is a $5-billion project on our doorstep," Mr. Byrne said. "As far as the tradeoffs, we just don't know yet."
Mr. Byrne said a key issue has been the province's capacity to take on major contracts without fuelling inflation or causing costly delays.
He said the province can ramp up its work force quickly by attracting home an army of skilled workers who have moved west to look for work.

Full text: With heritage sites across Canada increasingly at risk of being torn down, advocates call for a national trust of endangered buildings
It was in Fort Langley about 150 years ago that British Columbia was first claimed for Britain.
The fort was the first of its kind on the West Coast. It's still standing, a prized piece of Canada's past sitting just east of Vancouver.
There are about 7,200 such heritage sites across the country. They're finicky old dames requiring complex maintenance and upkeep, and while Britain and the United States have broad-based programs for preserving "built heritage" - a national trust and tax credits, respectively - Canada has none.
But a solution may soon come from, fittingly, Fort Langley. The region's MP, Mark Warawa, is spending the next few months speaking with people across the country in an effort to develop Canada's own National Heritage Trust.
"We're looking at what models work, and what's positive with the models in, for example, England, the United States," Mr. Warawa says.
Mr. Warawa is parliamentary secretary to Minister of Environment John Baird, who oversees Parks Canada and the portfolio for heritage preservation.
A national heritage trust system, advocates say, is badly needed. Heritage buildings are "endangered" in Canada, says Natalie Bull, executive director of the Heritage Canada Foundation, because developers often prefer to knock them down and start new.
It's easier, Ms. Bull says, to throw up a cookie-cutter development - such as a new condo - than to take time to work within an existing, antiquated heritage site with its own "quirks," or "problems."
"Oh, it's much more difficult," says Tom Payne, founding partner of Kuwabara Payne McKenna Blumberg, a Toronto architecture firm that has worked on the city's highest-profile heritage sites, including the new National Ballet School and the Young Centre for the Performing Arts. "But I think the results are much richer and more interesting."
Restoring a medium-sized heritage residential building costs $169 a square foot, according to a 2006 University of Waterloo report. A similarly sized new residential building costs $155 a square foot. And the upkeep of a heritage site is sporadic and unpredictable, while new buildings have set maintenance schedules.
"It's just a different approach," says Catherine Nasmith, president of the Architectural Conservancy of Ontario, which advocates for the preservation of heritage sites. "There always seems to be money for capital budgets, but maintenance is just not so sexy."
There's a green element to saving heritage buildings, too. Canada has lost 20 per cent of its pre-1920 buildings in the past 30 years, Ms. Bull of Heritage Canada Foundation says. Such demolished buildings account for a full third of the garbage in landfills, the foundation says.
"I think that we have a responsibility, especially in the context of a greener world, to use things effectively that are here now, and to try and minimize demolition and landfill," says Mr. Payne, the architect.
But to compensate for the inconveniences and extra costs of heritage properties, developers look for incentives - such as those that would be offered by a national heritage trust.
Canada once had such a program: the Canadian Commercial Heritage Properties Incentive Fund. Founded in 2003 with $30-million from the Liberal government, it offered funds for revitalizing buildings, ultimately helping preserve 52 buildings totalling $181-million in nine provinces. The Conservatives didn't renew it, but are considering incorporating it in the new national trust, for which they've so far pledged $5-million.
Currently, it falls to cities and provinces to fight for heritage sites. Victoria offers a 10-year tax exemption for heritage buildings to be turned into housing. It has prompted $137-million in investment so far, but the city is looking for help bearing the cost.
"The municipalities really are struggling on their own all across Canada to try and make heritage conservation work," says Steve Barber, Victoria's heritage planner. "It is a huge problem all across the country."
The cost of such programs proved too high in some cities. In Vancouver, developers who saved heritage sites once got a tax exemption and a density bonus, which could be sold off to other developers. The initiative sparked $400-million in investment, but paved the way for condo towers of unmitigated, undesired heights. The city cancelled the program in 2007.
Volunteers often play a crucial role. That's the case in Bonavista, a small town in eastern Newfoundland. Near the heart of the town is Alexander House, known by the locals as Bridge House, a classic home built around 1812 - the oldest known building in the province.
Gordon Bradley, the 78-year-old president of the Bonavista Historical Society, bought the house for $7,500 a few years ago. Volunteers put on a temporary roof and covered up the shattered windows. Right now, they're digging a ditch to divert water from the foundation. Eventually, piece by piece, they say they'll restore it to its original state.
"We never have enough money, of course," Mr. Bradley says. "But you expect that."
In search of a national success model for heritage preservation, Ms. Bull points to the United States, where two important incentives are used to entice developers to work with heritage sites. First, "rehabilitation tax credits" cut the taxes of developers who restore heritage sites. Second, the U.S. government has a "heritage first" policy - when looking for office space: it looks first at available heritage sites, creating a rental market for them."It really revolutionized the way developers in the U.S. look at heritage buildings," Ms. Bull says. "We have to treat them like resources that are worth maintaining and investing in."

TOP 10 MOST ENDANGERED BUILDINGS: COMPILED BY THE HERITAGE CANADA FOUNDATION
Church of the Holy Cross
Skatin, B.C.
Between the mid-1890s and 1905, the people of the Stl'al'imx Nation built this Gothic Revival "cathedral in the wilderness" out of local cedar. Since none of them had formal carpentry training, they relied on photographs of Gothic cathedrals in France to craft features such as three delicate steeples as well as a hand-carved altar and pews.
Old St. Patrick's Roman Catholic Church
Calgary
Built in 1904, in the Carpenter Gothic style, the oldest surviving Catholic church in Calgary features wood siding and a pyramidal wooden steeple. The building remains the property of the Roman Catholic Diocese. However, the land is owned by a funeral home that hopes to erect a mausoleum on the site.
The Grand Trunk
Pacific Railway Roundhouse
Biggar, Sask.
Built in 1909, the massive circular building was designed to service and store 21 locomotives at a time. Its construction included 12-metre fir beams and more than one million bricks. Tunnels have recently been discovered, presumably leading to the nearby railway station.
James Armstrong
Richardson
International Airport
Winnipeg
Built between 1961 and 1964, it is widely recognized as one of the finest examples of mid-century modern architecture in Canada. It includes two massive murals: Eli Bornstein's Structuralist Relief in Fifteen Parts and John Graham's Northern Lights .
Riverdale Hospital
Toronto
Built in 1963, this example of mid-century Canadian Modernist architecture includes a Japanese terrace garden, steel mushroom-shaped canopies and a 600,000-piece Saico glass mosaic. The City of Toronto owns the land, but Bridgepoint Health, which owns the building, has determined it is no longer suitable for hospital uses.
The Old Grand Trunk
Railway Station
Kingston
Built of solid grey limestone in 1856, Kingston's first train station has a distinctive mansard roof, its own water tower and a turntable. The station closed to rail service in 1974. The Pig & Whistle operated a restaurant there from 1987 to 1992. It has remained vacant and abandoned since then. A fire damaged it in 1996.
Bens Deli
Montreal
This Art Deco landmark, with its famous wrap-around illuminated corner sign, retains most of its original interior finishes such as stainless-steel coat racks, a sleek deli counter and stools. Situated on prime real estate, the building has been sold to a developer who has plans for a new 14-storey hotel.
Winter Street Prison
Sherbrooke
Built in 1865, the stone building is a Palladian-type structure constructed in a complex that also consists of a unique stone penitentiary wall, green space and the jailor's house. It continued its original function until 1990, when the prison was moved to more modern facilities.
St. Patrick's Church
Halifax
Located in downtown Halifax, this richly decorated Victorian Gothic church was built between 1883 and 1885 with the volunteer labour of Irish immigrants. It houses an 1898 Casavant organ - one of only two remaining from the firm's first 100 instruments. Four panels of its stained glass withstood the Halifax explosion of 1917.
Alexander House
Bonavista, Nfld.
Built between 1811 and 1814, the oldest documented residential property in the province is known locally as Bridge House. Accented by a natural stone foundation, it features gable-end chimneys, a central hallway and a highly symmetrical design.

Abstract: The Hope Bay cottagers lament the breaking of their bond with the Chippewas. "It comes down to trust," Ms. [Barbara Bobo] says. "There's a lot of people who don't trust the natives. There's a lot of people who don't trust the government. We did. ... We were the optimists."

Full text: Cheap cottages leased on native land seemed too good to be true. Turns out they were, reports Kelly Grant. Do the Saugeen summerers have something to learn from Hope Bay evictions?
The eastern shore of Lake Huron is renowned for its sunsets.
On a clear day, sunlight sparkles off the water for a few hours before the orange disc turns the sky mauve and dips beneath the horizon.
Mel Parisi, 60, has a front-row seat for the spectacle from the deck of his cottage near Southampton, a three-hour drive northwest of his Burlington home.
But he is quick to point out that the area offers more than pretty views at dusk.
"This is the last bastion of [cottage] affordability in the province," says Mr. Parisi, president of the Saugeen Cottagers' Association Inc., the umbrella group representing owners of 1,200 cottages in four different "blocks" on native land on the shores of Lake Huron.
In the enclaves on Saugeen First Nation reserves No. 28 and No. 29, cottages are priced low enough to give Muskoka devotees reverse sticker shock. In May, one place sold for $38,500. Others went for $45,000, $56,500 and $88,000.
Even prime lakefront views are cheap on the reserve: A four-bedroom, fully furnished home on a sand beach recently sold for $265,000.
There's a catch. All the cottages are on leased land and the leases expire in 2011.
It's up to the band to decide whether to renew the leases, making the corridor between Sauble Beach and Southampton the next potential hot spot in the sometimes volatile world of recreational property leasing on reserves.
In fact, Saugeen Chief Randall Kahgee, an aboriginal-rights lawyer, says he believes that the band could rake in more cash developing part of its coveted shorefront property, possibly as a resort - which would drive some cottagers off the land.
"It's one of the most pristine areas in Canada," he says. "We're not getting the maximum value for it at all."
Cottagers in Sauble/Southampton do not have to look far for a cautionary tale: Less than an hour away at Hope Bay, on the Bruce Peninsula, the owners of 68 cottages on a separate reserve were booted from their summer homes 18 months ago, sending a shudder through other cottage communities with native leases.
There are about 3,200 land-lease deals on 22 different reserves in Ontario, from Lake Simcoe to Bala to the Sudbury area. Most of these arrangements work well.
Native bands get a cash infusion from lease and service fees, while cottagers get access to some of the cheapest recreational property in Canada.
But the Hope Bay saga, now the subject of a $50-million lawsuit, coupled with the recent eviction of 33 families from cottages on a reserve near Kenora, illustrates the risks of buying or building a cottage on native land.
"Our families are blown apart," says Barbara Bobo, 59, one of the exiled Hope Bay cottagers. " ... This was [our] spiritual home."
LAND LEASING IS BIG BUSINESS
The practice of leasing reserve land to non-native cottagers stretches back roughly 40 years, longer on some reserves. Natives vote to designate land to the Crown - a process that used to be called "a conditional surrender" - for recreational leases. Cottagers can buy a building, but not the land beneath it. Instead, they lease reserve plots from the Crown with the understanding that every lease expires on a pre-determined date.
Despite the troubles at Hope Bay, Mr. Parisi and local real-estate agents are confident that all the leases on the Saugeen lands will be renewed before 2011. They say that is because the Saugeen First Nation's cottage operation is too lucrative to shut down.
"This is run as a business," says Jim McLaren, an agent with Wilfred McIntee & Co. real estate, the brokerage that handles the bulk of cottage sales on Saugeen land. "Hope Bay only had about 60 cottages - that's a drop in the bucket."
Indeed, Saugeen's operation, with its 1,200 cottages, is a cash cow compared with the shuttered land-lease business at Hope Bay, which was run by a separate band, the Chippewas of Nawash First Nation.
Cottagers on the Saugeen reserves pay an annual lease fee of $5,000 to $6,600, depending on their proximity to the water, plus a $600 service fee for garbage pickup, road maintenance and other essentials, according to Mr. Parisi.
If 1,200 cottagers pay an average lease rate of $5,800 a year, that's nearly $7-million. Most goes into a trust fund in Ottawa, which the band can tap for community projects.
Mr. Parisi and Mr. McLaren see the band's sharp business skills as a check against the troubles that touched off the Hope Bay eviction. However, the Saugeen band's business smarts could work against the cottagers if the band opts to develop part of its waterfront land with a venture such as a resort.
"You know the area. It's a tourist market," Chief Kahgee says. "[Is] the band deriving the maximum benefit from that market [by leasing to cottagers] based on other examples out there? The answer is definitely no."
He was reluctant to talk further about developing the land; he didn't want to spook the cottagers and derail 2011 lease negotiations, which are just beginning. Treading delicately in an interview, Chief Kahgee stressed that the band has not launched feasibility studies for any development and he promised ample warning if any cottagers are forced off the land. "That's the whole idea of starting this process now and not later down the road."
Mr. Parisi says he and Chief Kahgee held a "very productive" initial meeting late last week at which the chief promised to hold the necessary designation vote well before the leases expire - a positive sign for the cottagers.
Both sides are approaching the fledgling lease talks with optimism, encouraged that relations between the Saugeen and the cottagers have warmed since the last round of lease negotiations in the early 1990s.
That time, the band raised lease fees by as much as 300 per cent to better reflect the value of the land, sparking a court battle.
The band prevailed. Some cottagers simply walked away from their buildings.
A CAUTIONARY TALE
Most of the Hope Bay cottagers refuse to abandon their summer homes without a fight. Some won't even leave the inlet north of Wiarton.
A group of nine campers is summering in trailers less than a kilometre down a gravel road from the cottages they were kicked out of at the end of 2006 - even though 18 months have passed since their Chippewa landlords evicted them, and a steel gate (reinforced by a court order) bars them from their waterfront cabins.
"This is the only place I'd spend my summers," says Carol Crockatt from Mississauga, a 59-year-old collections agent who began visiting Hope Bay with her family as a baby.
Like many Toronto-area residents who flee north on weekends, Ms. Crockatt and her husband, Bill, a 65-year-old retired chemist, loved their Hope Bay refuge for reasons deeper than its clear waters and spectacular views of an opposing cliff face.
The couple's bond with the four-bedroom cottage, which they purchased for $39,000 in 1989, grew stronger as they fixed the place up. They panelled the interior, built a deck, tended a garden. They watched two daughters grow up there.
"I'm sleeping at a different place, but I'm still at the Bay with everybody I know. It's just that our kids won't come up now because they don't want to sleep in a tent or on a table in the trailer."
Ms. Bobo, who is from Ohio, is also clinging to hopes of returning to the Hope Bay cottage she bought in 1997.
When the Chippewas of Nawash asked the Hope Bay cottagers to clear out their property in the dead of winter in early 2007, Ms. Bobo was adamant: "I did not want to take anything out. In fact, I said, 'I'm not taking one teaspoon out of my cottage.' "
But in the end, she and her family panicked, came to Canada and packed up.
Since then, the cottagers have launched their lawsuit, centred largely on the fact that the Chippewas of Nawash are claiming the empty cottages as their own.
The thrust and parry of claims and counterclaims that followed the suit, filed in February, lay bare the messiness of the situation: The cottagers knew that their leases had expired in 1995, yet stayed put; the federal government, which oversees the land-leasing regime, has foisted blame on the band; the band says responsibility lies with Ottawa, which signed the leases.
The expiration of the leases in 1995 is pivotal to the Hope Bay case.
The cottagers should have known they had no right to stay without a formal lease, Ottawa and the band say. The tradeoff for such cheap access to waterfront property was the risk cottagers could be evicted any time after 1995.
Some cottagers admit that they should have been more hard-nosed when Ottawa kept collecting their cheques despite the fact the formal lease had expired.
"We stupidly assumed that there would always be a lease because you bought this building," Ms. Crockatt says. "They're not going to steal this building from you."
Cottagers didn't rush to remove their buildings in 1995 because they were repeatedly promised that a new lease was in the works; in fact, the Chippewas of Nawash tried three times to hold the necessary referendum to renew the leases, but twice not enough band members showed up.
Chief Ralph Akiwenzie, the band council, and their lawyer, Patrick Nadjiwan, all declined to be interviewed for this story.
So the question that most baffles the cottagers remains unanswered: Why, after a third referendum in September, 2005, at which a new lease was finally approved, did the deal fall apart?
"I have no idea. God's honest truth," says Ivan Porter, a 67-year-old Milton resident who bought his cottage with wife, Jean, 69, in 2003 for $89,000.
Even if Chief Akiwenzie were willing to speak publicly about the eviction, he might not have all the answers. That's because in July, 2005, he lost an election to Paul Nadjiwan (a distant cousin of Patrick) after 16 years as chief. Chief Akiwenzie was re-elected last summer. It was during the two-year Nadjiwan interregnum that the lease deal collapsed and the band decided to kick the cottagers out.
The band gives no reason in its court filings for evicting the cottagers; it simply reiterates the fact that the leases ended April 1, 1995.
Paul Nadjiwan, who has since left the reserve, could not be reached.
The Hope Bay cottagers lament the breaking of their bond with the Chippewas. "It comes down to trust," Ms. Bobo says. "There's a lot of people who don't trust the natives. There's a lot of people who don't trust the government. We did. ... We were the optimists."

Asking price: $1,139,000
Selling price: $1,239,000
Taxes: $6,080 (2007)
Lot size: 20 by 129 feet
Days on the market: one
Listing agent: Julie Kinnear, Royal LePage Real Estate Services Ltd.
Many fans of heritage homes have visited this three-storey Victorian in Cabbagetown during the annual tours of historic residences run by a local group. So the day it went up for sale, only a few people got to see it before it was sold at $100,000 over the asking price, agent Julie Kinnear says.
From its high ceilings and custom renovations by Powell & Bonnell to its deep lot and unique backyard setting, it's a "really cool house," she adds. "It's definitely one of the landmark Cabbagetown houses."
The designated heritage property has several rare features, including wood siding rather than the traditional brick. And there is parking for four cars between the rear lane and garage, unlike at other homes where there may be one space, or none at all, the agent says.
On the main floor, the kitchen has a breakfast room and stainless-stainless appliances. The adjacent dining room, like most rooms in the house, displays crown moulding and hardwood flooring. There also is a powder room on this level.
There are two staircases, the second being a rear one once used by the butler. Beyond that is the living room, which features a wood-burning fireplace and a set of controls for a built-in sound system that extends over the entire floor. The room also opens to the backyard, where there is a hot tub.
"Instead of a regular hot tub, they did one that's landscaped into the ground - more like a plunge pool - with natural rocks," Ms. Kinnear explains.
The home's park-like setting thrives with trees, flowers and bushes, surrounded by interlocking brick and slate paths and a cabana. In-ground sprinklers and garden lights also were installed.
The second floor houses a full bathroom, a master suite with French doors to a deck, and a family room with a second wood-burning fireplace, built-in wall unit, vaulted ceiling and open staircase to the third-floor bedroom. The latter contains a four-piece bathroom and walk-in closet, and opens to an upper deck.
Within the past year, the property was painted; the roof, windows, wiring and furnace were replaced; and part of the basement was dug up to create eight-foot ceilings, which is "another rarity," Ms. Kinnear says.

Full text: When city dweller Linda Read first saw the land with a house and outbuildings, she fell in love with it, and she's never looked back
When Linda Reader saw the farm nearly 20 years ago, more than the farmhouse caught her eye. Yes, it was pretty - a specimen of the simple Ontario gothic style, in close to its original condition. But the outbuildings - a barn and sheds - also made her heart beat faster. Here was a working farm in good shape. Perhaps she could run it herself, the apartment dweller from Toronto thought.
The land - 90 acres - was excellent, and there was a well on it. Even the septic tank passed muster.
"The land was rolling with good drainage and loam, plus it was in crop," Ms. Reader says.
The property is just a short drive from Flesherton, a village about 75 kilometres west of Barrie that was founded in the late 1800s. The farm itself was established in 1889 by the Talbot family, who practised mixed farming. Later, it was bought by the Thomsens, who, beginning in the l950s, ran it as a state-of-the-art dairy farm, and also raised eight children there.
The house exterior, barn and other outbuildings were painted black and white, "like the Holstein cattle the Thomsens had, when I bought it [in 1989]," says Ms. Reader, a former college professor who is now the economic development officer for the township of Wellington North.
She adds: "It's always an advantage to buy land where cattle have been living."
"My place has pure, clean water from a well that was once run by a windmill."
Over the years, Ms. Reader has had the mechanical systems updated, the well refitted, the plumbing and wiring upgraded, and the chimney and roof replaced. Some floors have been refinished or replaced, wallpaper stripped and plasterwork done.
The farmhouse is welcoming and full of warmth - a testament to Ms. Reader's inspired touches. It has been carefully renovated over the years - never gutted and definitely not citified. In fact, the kitchen and bathroom, both of which feature cabinetry from the Thomsens' tenure, are as delightful as the rooms that have been extensively refurbished with new flooring and plaster.
Entering the house is like stepping into a cozy world where a pot of coffee is always on the stove and a pie is bubbling in the oven. Details stand out: Flowers in rich colours cascade from window boxes and containers on the dwelling's two porches, a cheerful red chicken looks down from a poster above the small kitchen table, a lacquered tea tray graces one of the guest bedrooms.
The barn has a milk house attached, a reminder of when the Thomsens ran their dairy farm. There also are steel and wooden drive sheds and a chicken house. The sturdy, well-constructed buildings are put to excellent use by Ms. Reader. Area farmers rent the barn for their cattle, and other locals pay to store their boats in the drive sheds every winter.
Ms. Reader used to raise chickens herself, selling them locally, but always keeping a few for herself so she could treat family and friends to tasty dinners.
"That's a wonderful thing about raising chickens," she says, laughing. "You have these nice plump birds in your freezer when you need them."
Over the years, Ms. Reader has gained lots of experience driving a tractor, and pulling the machinery that cuts and bales hay, but these days, she rents her land to farmers who grow and harvest the crop to use as animal feed.
"I was approached by local farmers who knew I was not using all the buildings and the land," she says, adding that "renting your farmland is a good way to maintain it. Otherwise, it will eventually go to weeds and revert in time to scrub. When I saw the hay growing, I knew I could have income from my land."
Ms. Thomsen apparently kept a large and prolific vegetable garden, an activity that Ms. Reader successfully continued while she was still teaching. She sold the produce - along with her chickens and homemade chutneys and teas - at the Flesherton Farmers Market, which she helped start.
As a professor at Humber College, she had the long summer holidays to tend to her farm. She raised ducks as well as chickens, and still has a donkey, and an unending supply of barn cats and kittens, which she cares for and adopts out to many of her friends from Toronto.
The farm sits at the top of a hill, and from the kitchen window, Ms. Reader's lush and green land extends as far as the eye can see. With the windows open, the farmhouse is cooled by breezes fragrant with the scents of mown hay and wildflowers.
A storey and a half, with a frame construction and aluminum siding, the house has many unique features. There are plaster rosettes on the main-floor ceilings. Upstairs, the four bedrooms have sloping ceilings, which together with carefully selected wallpapers and antique furnishings, create a cozy and comforting atmosphere. Some of the plank flooring on this level is still painted. There are no closets, but wardrobes and dressers hold clothes and linens.
A hand-stitched pillow cover given to Ms. Reader's mother Gladys graces one room.
The wooden, tongue-and-groove doors still have their antique handles. When one door stubbornly refuses to open, Ms. Reader suggests - not completely seriously - that Grandma Talbot is holding it shut.
"There have been stories of ghosts here," she says. "People have heard music and seen things. An old man in his 70s - a Talbot who was born here - dropped by a few years ago and told me that the room - formerly a parlour, now my bedroom - on the main floor was where Grandmother Talbot had been laid out."
Her own family has played a huge part in Ms. Reader's enjoyment of the farmhouse. She has hosted numerous celebrations; at Christmas, she decorates the place top to bottom, with boughs and berries from the fields and a large local tree. These boisterous and joyous gatherings maintain the traditions of the farm's early days.
According to Talbot family member who visited, dances were held every fall in what is now Ms. Reader's dining room to celebrate the harvest.
"I think hoedown must refer to putting down the hoe and stopping work," she says, noting that "there was a lot of spring in the floor in that room and I had to have it reinforced from the basement and eventually replaced.
"There were marks on the wainscoting which the gentleman told me were caused by wood being thrown against the wall for use in the fire in a stove that used to be in that room."
Today, the living room contains a wood-burning stove, which provides heat to some of the other rooms through ducts, while an oil-burning furnace warms up the rest of the house, when needed.
Ms. Reader fixed up the place gradually as she earned the money, and now estimates she spent in the neighbourhood of $90,000.
Farms in the area are selling well. Real estate agent Robert Porteus of Royal LePage RCR Realty notes that there is always a market for these properties, with farmers - including the local Mennonites - always seeking good farmland, and other people wanting a place for recreational use.
"A client might pay over $400,000 for a good farm with substantial acreage," he says. "People looking for property come from London, Kitchener and Guelph as well as Toronto. They might want a place where their kids can snowmobile and they can relax by doing outdoor chores.
"I'm an old farmer myself, but I gave it up to work in real estate because farming was a long struggle. People look for land that is farmable or scenic, and having property with substantial acreage is a definite asset."
Ms. Reader points out that there is a lot more to consider when buying a farm than whether the house is well kept up or a dilapidated one with "potential."
The words "lay of the land" have true meaning when it comes to farm properties, she says. Is the land well drained? Is the soil good, or dry and arid? What about water? Where does it come from and is it safe for drinking?
"I suggest walking the entire acreage of [a] property and taking someone who understands farms and farming along," she advises.
Growing your own
As a farm owner in Flesherton, Ont., Linda Reader has gained a lot of experience growing vegetables and fruit. But because of her work, she doesn't do as much of it as she once did, although she still maintains a cutting garden.
She enjoys setting a large table on trestles under one of her two apple trees (one produces Duchesses for pies, the other, Alexandras for applesauce), and serving a leisurely lunch featuring specialties from nearby farms and specialty shops.
"Now, I don't have the time to actively farm, but in my capacity as a community economic specialist [for the township of Wellington North], I have the pleasure of working with local farmers on projects like the Butter Tart Trail, which showcases farm-gate sales and local produce," she says.
"Lunch, when I serve it, might feature cheese from River's Edge Goat Dairy or Shepherd's Watch sheep dairy, baked goods from the Village Bakery, and fresh strawberries, flowers and vegetables from Misty Meadows Mennonite market.
"Buying things that are grown and produced in this way is healthier, helps local economies and reduces the carbon footprint by eliminating shipping from all over the continent and beyond," Ms. Reader says.
"Plus, this is sublimely delicious food!"

Full text: Adding insulation, installing better windows and using a solar air heater are all great ways to cut your home's heating costs, especially if you live in an area blessed with a temperate climate and an abundance of sun.
Even in winter-challenged Canada, however, there are plenty of examples of off-grid homes that are not connected to local power sources and are self-sufficient for most of their energy needs.
Anthony Ketchum, 70, built one such dwelling about a decade ago: a cottage in the Hockley Valley, a 20-minute drive from Orangeville, Ont.
His house gets its electricity from seven photovoltaic panels that feed a battery bank, and a small wind turbine boosts the system in winter months.
"We took the plunge to be off-grid and heat the house from earth sheltering," says Mr. Ketchum, owner of Household Project Management Inc. in Toronto, where he lives.
The 4.2-acre property is on a steep hillside, so two sides of the three-bedroom, two bathroom house are below ground. This means it benefits from some natural geothermal heat and stays above 10 degrees even in winter, with no added heat source. An occasional wood fire is all it takes to keep things comfortable.
The south and west faces are exposed, with lots of windows to capture solar heat. The house also has custom krypton-filled windows that are heat mirrored (an interior film effectively makes them triple-glazed) and insulate to R8. The windows cost about $12,000, Mr. Ketchum says, but "over time they paid for themselves."
Although it is a getaway cottage for him and his wife, he estimates that if it were heated for year-round use, it would take about a cord of wood a year, at a cost of about $600. When he does use wood, it is burned in a special masonry heater that is common in Scandinavia; it weighs six tonnes and holds heat long enough to keep the place at room temperature for 24 hours, he says.
"You have to learn how much [electricity] you can use," Mr. Ketchum says of living off-grid. "We have to be careful how much we use and know how much everything uses." The pump for the well, for example, draws a lot of power.
By choosing energy-efficient appliances and using the electricity carefully, the couple enjoy many conveniences including power tools, a vacuum cleaner and a dishwasher. But inefficient ones that convert electricity use to heat, such as a clothes dryer or hair dryer, are out.
The house has two composting toilets and a 9,000-litre underground cistern fed by rainwater from the roof.
"I can't stand the waste of electricity in our society and am not a fan of nuclear. I grew up in a time when you conserved electricity," Mr. Ketchum says "The chance to do something off-grid was a dream I had that I never thought would be possible."
And when the ice storm hit in 1998 and his neighbours were without power, some of the non-environmental reasons for going off-grid became abundantly clear, as he sat in his cozy living room enjoying life as usual.

Full text: 53 Main St. South
What: Markham's first postal outlet and now a designated heritage home that blends historic charm and modern conveniences.
Living space: 2,900 square feet
Lot size: 76 by 147 feet
Asking price: $639,000
Taxes: $4,300 (2005)
Agent: Leslie Benczik, Re/Max All-Stars Realty Inc.
Markham has been rapidly expanding as new housing projects are built, but the town also boasts two heritage conservation districts with high concentrations of century-old buildings, including residential homes.
One of the areas is on Markham's Main Street, near Highway 7, where this two-storey house is located. The dwelling is considered unique not only because of its historical significance as the town's first postal outlet, but also because of its spacious interior and large ravine lot.
"It's a ... century home that's been beautifully restored recently by a renowned builder in the area who owns and lives there," agent Leslie Benczik says. "He's has done a lot of restoration [work] in Rosedale and Forest Hill."
Documents state that the landmark property was built as a post office and private residence circa 1828, although a plaque mounted on the facade claims it was in 1820. One document says the house also accommodated a general store.
According to records obtained by a Richmond Hill historian, James Johnston was the first postmaster at the outlet, where he also lived. But upon his illness and death in 1832, his cousin, Archibald Barker, took over.
Mr. Barker - who was also a merchant, mill owner and justice of the peace - ran the local post office with his family for nearly five decades.
By the middle of the 19th century, however, the postal operations had been moved north to the commercial core of Markham Village.
Physical signs of its days as a post office are gone, but much of its traditional architectural features have been preserved.
"The key thing is keeping everything as original as possible," Mr. Benczik says. "You've got the original banisters there that have been fixed and restored, original baseboards, trims, doors and framework."
Pine floors, multiple fireplaces and a claw-foot tub in the master ensuite bathroom adds to the character of the house.
The facade has telltale Georgian traits, such as its symmetrical five bays and the sash windows on the side and rear, some of them original to the house.
Aluminum siding was added in the 1960s, followed by new front windows, a transom and sidelights around the front door, and a wraparound covered porch. The furnace and roof also were replaced, while the plumbing and wiring systems were upgraded.
The kitchen has been renovated and now includes granite countertops, pot lights and a breakfast bar. In addition, a breakfast room was created where a storage area had been, the garage was converted into a study, and the master ensuite bathroom was installed upstairs.
Because of the changes and additions, there is now about 2,900 square feet of living space, which was ideal for the seller to raise a family. "It's a good-sized home," Mr. Benczik adds.
While an average lot in the area is about 50 by 120 feet, this one has pie-shaped grounds that measure 76 feet across and 147 feet deep along one side.
"It's beautifully landscaped, larger than others, and backs on to a ravine," the agent says. "[The buyer] would be somebody who's really interested in the history of a property like this and wants that ravine-type lot."
The amenities
This century-old Georgian has four bedrooms, three bathrooms, a main-floor family room, study and four fireplaces, including one upstairs.
There is an open living and dining area with two wood-burning fireplaces, crown mouldings and broadloom. A door between the fireplaces leads to a study with a cathedral ceiling.
The kitchen features granite countertops, pot lights and a breakfast bar. Wood flooring extends into a rear breakfast room and the family room, which has a gas fireplace, built-in shelves and stained-glass windows. A powder room rounds out the floor.
Each bedroom upstairs is on a corner of the house, and has built-in cabinetry. The master ensuite bathroom has a cathedral ceiling, claw-foot tub and pine flooring. There also is a four-piece common bathroom on this floor.
The basement is not finished.
A long private driveway has room for six cars, and a small detached structure could be used as a workshop or garage.

Prices for detached homes down, but are still at the high end

Abstract: As the 2000s dawned, Oakville residents and politicians became a formidable force in attempting to curb new housing developments, particularly north of Dundas Street. The movement was driven by a desire to protect the conservation areas surrounding Sixteen Mile and Bronte creeks. But it also was concerned that the scale and style of developments planned for the area would make Oakville appear - like some other 905 suburbs - close to bursting at the seams, and that was not acceptable.

Full text: Oakville has always been among the favoured destinations of home buyers who are moving up the ladder with growing families. A lot of its cachet comes from its reputation as a relatively affluent community thanks to its history as a lakeside retreat for moneyed folk during the first half of the 20th century.
The scale of that affluence can still be seen in the highly prized, grand mansions - built by shipbuilding, railroad and steelmaking magnates - that still stand along the Lake Ontario waterfront.
As Oakville transformed from a retreat community into a Toronto suburb, developers of new subdivisions north of the Queen Elizabeth Way were more than happy to seize on the town's pretensions to wealth and comfort. And buyers were more than happy to bank on the resale premium that came with Oakville's reputation.
As the 2000s dawned, Oakville residents and politicians became a formidable force in attempting to curb new housing developments, particularly north of Dundas Street. The movement was driven by a desire to protect the conservation areas surrounding Sixteen Mile and Bronte creeks. But it also was concerned that the scale and style of developments planned for the area would make Oakville appear - like some other 905 suburbs - close to bursting at the seams, and that was not acceptable.
More recently, the city has become an unlikely hotbed of condominium development aimed at local residents looking to downsize from their current detached homes.
So far in 2008, Oakville is one of the few submarkets in which prices for new detached homes have fallen. The average price for such a home in the first five months of the year was still a princely $710,761, but that was down 5 per cent from $748,174 in the same period of 2007, according to Canada Mortgage and Housing Corp.
But that's still a huge premium compared with the average price of a new detached home in Halton Region, which was $552,853.
The number of sales of new low-rise homes in Oakville is also down in the January-to-May period, to 292, according to RealNet Canada Inc. That's a 48-per-cent drop from 565 in the first five months of 2007.
This puts Oakville in second place for sales in Halton Region, behind Milton, which has a multitude of low-rise projects under way. (RealNet low-rise data also include sales of semi-detached and freehold townhouses.)
There are a few large-scale detached developments on greenfield sites under way in Oakville, mostly on the west side of town in close proximity to picturesque Bronte Creek. Elsewhere, there are a handful of smaller-scale detached projects where developers have taken advantage of infill opportunities in existing residential neighbourhoods.
The common thread in all these new low-rise projects is they are generally a cut above what you might find in more affordable pockets of Halton Region in terms of price, exterior finishes and size.
The Bronte Creek project near Bronte Road and Dundas Street West is one of the large-scale communities under way. It is being co-developed by Branthaven Homes, Monarch Homes and Fernbrook Homes.
Monarch has been actively building there since 2003, and still has a good selection of detached houses - including some bungalows with lofts - on 36-, 46- and 56-foot-wide lots. They range from $465,000 for 1,956 square feet to $728,000 for 3,735 square feet. Approximately 50 of these lots are still available.
Branthaven's Bronte Creek offerings go from $503,000 for 2,100 square feet to $546,000 for 2,915 square feet. Models reflect a more rural flavour than those by Monarch, which evoke the feeling of French chateaus.
Fernbrook's contribution to the development features more modest exteriors but a lot more square footage; nine homes on 46-foot-wide lots range from $689,000 to $811,000 for between 3,346 and 3,849 square feet.
Developments on the scale of Bronte Creek are likely going to face more competition from more intimate projects such as Heritage Estates by Dawn Victoria Homes. It's also off Bronte Road but closer to the lakeshore beside Queen Elizabeth Park.
Only 25 lots were released there, and five - with 50- and 60-foot widths - remain for sale. Prices range from $713,000 to $757,000 for between 2,131 and 3,504 square feet.

Abstract: The service isn't as polished as at Glowbal's other properties. The truffle creams, racks of lamb and other luxury items have all been dropped. But this isn't a special occasion restaurant. With most prices ranging from $11 to $14 (and no entree costing more than $18), this is the kind of place you can afford to go back to again and again.

Full text: The modern temple motif is lovely, but this 'upscale izakaya' falls far short in a crowded field of Japanese contenders
If you build it, they will come. So says Kay Kaneyoshi, owner of Kakurenbou Japanese Dining, a new izakaya (of sorts) that hopes to stand out in a crowded field by positioning itself as a high-end restaurant replete with valet parking, premium sake, Champagne and three different cuts of Wagyu beef.
"Upscale izakaya" is an oxymoron that would cause considerable confusion in Japan, where izakayas are casual pubs that offer cheap beer, small plates for sharing and a boisterous vibe for the after-work crowd.
But in Vancouver the contradiction doesn't seem quite so odd. The popular dining trend is so widespread it's taken on a life of its own. The local incarnations already run the gamut from grubby hole-in-the-wall (Gyoza Kings) to hipster sleek (Hapa Izakaya) and all sorts of hybrids in between. Japanese casual fine dining - why not?
As the chief architect and owner of New World Architects, Mr. Kaneyoshi has already designed and constructed several successful restaurants, including the acclaimed Kingyo Izakaya on Denman Street and Motomachi Shokudo, a spiffy little ramen shop up the road.
He pulled out all the stops for Kakurenbou. The restaurant's modern temple motif certainly is lovely: The room is divided into all sorts of cozy nooks and crannies, sectioned off with leafy bamboo gardens, wooden blinds, pebbled pathways and antique wooden beams imported from Japan that have been fastened into archways with traditional artisan joinery.
But here's the rub: Despite all his experience building restaurants, Mr. Kaneyoshi has never operated one before. Nor has his partner, real-estate developer Steven Lee. Or his general manager, Ryoma Ohashi, a former employee recruited from New World Architects.
"I've worked at a bunch of fish-and-chip places in Steveston," Mr. Ohashi later explained, extolling his creden-
tials when we talked by phone. "And I used to work for a Japanese food distributor."
Well, at least that explains why our server seemed so nervous. The poor thing obviously didn't have any training. And the people in charge don't seem to have a clue what they're doing.
Take the beverage program, for instance. It seemed impressive, at least at first glance: seven types of beer, nine sakes, several brands of shochu and plum wines, 20 original cocktails, 25 food-friendly wines from all around the world (with mark-ups less than the standard 50 per cent), three sparkling wines and two Champagnes.
But when we tried to order, the restaurant was out of stock of almost every beer, wine and sake we requested. My fresh-squeezed orange-juice cocktail with lychee liqueur was served warm and flat. And the wine? When our server tried to open a bottle - sweating, stumbling and cracking the cork - everyone at the table cringed in sympathy.
The food didn't rise to the occasion, either. Katsuhiko Yamamura is a kaiseki-trained chef imported from Japan. But he's not cooking that type of exquisitely refined, multicourse dining here.
The menu at Kakurenbou mainly comprises ordinary izakaya standards - daikon salad ($6.30), garlic croquettes stuffed with roasted garlic cloves ($6.50), spicy mayo prawns ($9.80) - when all can be found either slightly cheaper or in more plentiful portions elsewhere in the neighbourhood.
The house specialties are nothing to crow about: Crispy chicken karaage ($9.80) were juicy, deep-fried thighs rolled in a luxurious coating of seasoned Rice Krispies; fried garlic chicken gizzards ($7.50) were tiny, chewy mouthfuls of batter.
Spicy grilled calamari and leek ($9.80), bathed in a deeply savoury miso broth and topped with a nest of finely sliced chili pepper, was flavourful but texturally boring.
Toro Katsu ($10.80), coated in barely cooked layers of herbed breadcrumbs and wet flour paste, was a complete waste of fresh albacore tuna. Imagine yourself chewing on soggy papier-mâché.
But the most disappointing - and telling - dish of the night was the stone-grilled prime steak ($21.50). We wanted to upgrade to Kobe beef but were told, once again, that there wasn't any available.
"Are you sure this isn't Kobe?" I asked the waitress, after she plunked six small cubes of densely marbled strip loin on the table.
Yes, actually, it was. She punched in the wrong order, the missing meat suddenly appeared and we weren't going to be charged extra. Great.
And then she retreated, without any instructions. Several other staff members hovered nearby as we stared helplessly at the sizzling hot stone grill and raw hunks of prized beef (actually raised in Australia and therefore Wagyu, not Kobe). Steak this fatty is completely ruined if overcooked. It shouldn't be left in the clumsy hands of customers. Sure enough, we grilled half the pieces too long and they ended up chewy. The other three pieces were melt-in-the-mouth luscious.
But it sure would have been nice if the chef - or anybody - had helped us out a bit. Had we been paying full price, $38 for 150 grams, we would have been really upset.
Dreams are fine and dandy. But a good restaurant requires more than just fancy decor and pricey raw ingredients. It requires consistency, well-trained staff members who know what they're doing and concerned managers who can step in when all else falters.
In Vancouver, the competition among izakaya restaurants is fierce. Kakurenbou Japanese Dining falls shorter than most.

Side dish
Nothing makes me happier than when I revisit a restaurant that didn't initially thrill me and come out blissfully stuffed and pleasantly impressed.
Trattoria Italian Kitchen is a shining example.
I didn't hate the original Italian Kitchen when it opened last summer. But I wasn't in any rush to return. I thought the food was flabby, bland and overpriced, the downtown locale too flashy.
This summer, the Glowbal Restaurant Group (which also owns Glowbal, Coast and Sanafir) expanded to Kitsilano with a dialled-down trattoria that boasts much cheaper prices and a more casual setting.
More importantly, the food is vastly improved: The pizza crust is lighter, the pastas are brighter, the panzanella (bread salad) is no longer soggy.
And the fish? The fresh whole trout baked fast and crispy in the fiery pizza ovens is spectacular.
The service isn't as polished as at Glowbal's other properties. The truffle creams, racks of lamb and other luxury items have all been dropped. But this isn't a special occasion restaurant. With most prices ranging from $11 to $14 (and no entree costing more than $18), this is the kind of place you can afford to go back to again and again.
Owner Emad Yacoub says he plans to build the concept into a chain, with 10 locations in Vancouver by 2011.
I say good luck. He's got a very tasty product on his hands.

Full text: A standoff over the future of a vast swath of forest on the southern tip of Vancouver Island, estimated to be worth about $150-million, is heating up as a regional government contemplates taking a forestry company to court to block its plans to subdivide the area and sell it for development.
A report by Auditor-General John Doyle in July slammed the government's decision to grant Duncan-based Western Forest Products' application to exclude about 20,000 acres from its tree-farm licence. The report states that the government failed to take public interest into account, didn't make the decision sufficiently transparent and wasn't adequately informed.
Forests Minister Pat Bell says there's nothing he can do about the timberland, which was deleted from the company's licence on Jan. 31, 2007. Western Forest Products has found a potential buyer and is awaiting approval of a proposed subdivision of the area. But local residents, environmental groups and the regional government fear real estate development could turn the massive wilderness area into suburban sprawl.
Western Forest Products chief operating officer Duncan Kerr said the company is acting by the book, and had to log the land, or sell it.
The Capital Regional District threw down the gauntlet in earnest on July 15, when it sent a letter informing Mr. Kerr he needed a permit from the regional government to go through with construction on areas proposed for subdivision. Mr. Kerr's reply on July 28 countered that the company disagreed, and that "Western's forest management activities are protected from CRD's bylaws. ..." Now, says Capital Regional District corporate communications manager Andy Orr, the regional government may take the matter to court.
"It is unclear exactly what our rights are," he said. "We haven't reached that decision yet, but we may be testing that in court."
Part of the disagreement centres on who has jurisdiction over land no longer regulated under tree-farm licence.
"What happens on private lands when they are not forestry lands any more?" he asked.
Mr. Kerr said that as far as he's concerned, Western doesn't need any district permits and is just awaiting approval of its applications from the province. Then, he said, the company plans to sell the land, and has a "tentative purchase agreement" with Ilkay Developments.
Mr. Kerr said he would have been happy to discuss setting aside part of the area as parkland, but the Capital Regional District cut those negotiations short when it passed bylaws that would have prevented Western from proceeding with the subdivision had it tried to change the application it put forward in April.
Lawyers acting on behalf of the Sea-to-Sea Greenbelt Society have submitted a letter to Premier Gordon Campbell's office demanding he veto Western's subdivision application. It comes on the heels of calls from the NDP opposition and an association representing 48 local governments for the Premier to reverse the timberland's removal from the tree-farm licence system.
A spokesman for Mr. Campbell said the Premier's office has received the Greenbelt Society's request and will consider it, but couldn't say how it would factor into the subdivision approval process.

Full text: There's disturbing news for people trying to sell homes in a Canadian real estate market where buyers may be getting the upper hand.
A nascent trend in the U.S. market has buyers not only tromping and gawking their way through homes for sale, but also sleeping over or at least hanging out for extended periods to get the feel of the place. One shudders to think of the next concession that sellers will make to buyers. Whatever it is, the place to find out about it is on a growing number of real estate and housing blogs.
Blogs, on the off chance you haven't heard, are an online platform where people with an interest in a topic post their musings on a regular basis. Financial topics are big in the blogosphere and, as money matters go, there's nothing bigger for most people than buying and selling a home.
Most housing blogs are written by people in the industry, such as agents or mortgage brokers, which makes sense because real estate matters are not a day-to-day concern for most individuals. One issue that does come up repeatedly is mortgages, which happens to be the subject of one of the most essential blogs in the real estate area.
It's called Canadian Mortgage Trends and it's produced by mortgage planners Melanie and Robert McLister. In a clear, to-the-point manner, this site dissects the latest interest rate tends, new developments at banks and other lenders and anything else of relevance.
If you're trying to make sense of the federal government's move to eliminate 40-year and zero-down payment mortgages for home buyers requiring federally-backed mortgage insurance, this website is a great resource. A recent posting showed how it may still be possible to buy a house without a down payment even after the new rules take effect Oct. 15.
A good blog generates lots of comments from readers, and Canadian Mortgage Trends excels here. Many readers are mortgage professionals, so their comments may seem somewhat technical. But there's great material here for people who are willing to do some research to find the right mortgage.
Another blog, Real Estate Intelligence, is focused to a large extent on the Toronto market, but it's also a place to look for nuggets of information on the broader housing market. In fact, this is where I learned about people sleeping over at homes they were thinking of buying. If you're thinking of exploiting the plunge in the U.S. market to buy a house in Florida, check out the July 13 posting titled "Take my house - please."
Real estate blogs covering the market in a particular city are pretty common and you can find them by doing a Google search along the lines of "real estate blog Saskatoon." No snickering - that's a hot market they have there.
You'll find if you do one of these searches that lots of real estate agents and mortgage brokers are using blogs to pull in clients. Most of these blogs can be skipped. If they're not spreading the message that everything's A-OK in the housing market, they're reprinting articles published already in newspapers and on other websites.
One exception is a blog that covers the Vancouver market, which has the honour of being the country's most expensive. YatterMatters, maintained by real estate agent Larry Yatkowsky, has a candid tone that adds credibility to his take on the local market. Right now, Mr. Yatkowsky sees things slowing down, despite what the real estate industry might say (see his recent posts for more details).
For outright skepticism about the housing market, try the blog written by Liberal MP Garth Turner. Mr. Turner recently wrote a book called Greater Fool , which argues that a real estate mania has affected not only the U.S. market, but parts of Canada as well. As a way of promoting his work, Mr. Turner has set up a Greater Fool blog that catalogues all signs of trouble in the housing market. A good blog is an opinionated one, and Mr. Turner delivers. Check out his July 16 posting for a vintage performance.
If you want to know what happens when a real estate bubble pops, check out The Housing Bubble, a U.S. blog that blends housing factoids and quotes into a commentary on a housing market in crisis. Read closely and you'll find references to the odd Canadian city here.
Most real estate blogs focus on the buying and selling of homes, and not the many financial issues that are raised when you already own a home. For that kind of commentary, try a good general purpose personal finance blog like Canadian Capitalist, Million Dollar Journey or Quest for Four Pillars. Many of these blogs have subject indexes or archives that you can use to jump right to posts on mortgages or housing.

Crash at my pad in 2010 - for $35,000

Abstract: "We have been approached by many, many people," he says. "We are looking at everything from a complete buyout for the duration, to smaller three-day deals or keeping the 40-seat wine cellar separate for our regular clients. We've been approached for private dinners in some of the bigger executive homes here and corporate catering events." Nothing is decided, he says. "In the end, I don't know what we'll do. Money talks, you know?"

Full text:   For mortgage-weary Vancouverites, the Olympics will be the perfect time to skip town, rent out the homestead and reap the profit
There's nothing quite like becoming an Olympic venue to give a city an inflated sense of its own worth.
Ask Vancouverites what they think of the Games and the rosy glow of civic pride turns quickly into thoughts of hard cash. In a city known for its red-hot housing market, the first reaction of many residents is not to bid for tickets to cheer on Team Canada, but to get the heck out of town and make a killing renting out their pad.
It looks like bargain-hunting visitors will have their work cut out for them, if prices remain where they are. According to ads placed on the mushrooming number of websites devoted to 2010 rentals, a two-bedroom condo in trendy Yaletown - handy for downtown venues - will set you back about $36,000 for the month of February, 2010. If you don't mind a lengthy SkyTrain commute from the suburbs of New Westminster for a property that can house 12, you'll need to stump up $45,000.
A luxury home in the mountains of West Vancouver is currently in the $2,500- to $4,000-a-night range.
And that is just what is already on the market. According to Blake MacKenzie, guest services manager at Emrvacationrentals.com, inquiries from prospective visitors currently outstrip listings. "We've had countless calls from homeowners interested in renting out their properties," he said. "But many are waiting in the expectation that they will get more money nearer the Games."
So should opportunistic homeowners expect to cash in?
"Most properties in Vancouver are sitting at the $400 per bedroom per night rate," said Mark Szekely, site administrator of Rent2010.com. "Which seems to me a level which may prove comparable to hotel rates."
"There are 75,000 hotel rooms, and an estimated 300,000 visitors," Mr. MacKenzie pointed out. "Anywhere along the SkyTrain or the rail lines - as far out as Abbotsford and Mission [which involve a journey time of a little more than an hour] - as long as the price is flexible and reasonable, may be good options for families on a budget."
Those farthest flung, he says, could even be rented out to Vancouverites looking for somewhere to live while their own place plays host to Olympic visitors. (They will, after all, have the funds.)
The caveat, Mr. MacKenzie said, is that those on the fence should act soon. "I expect [visitors] to start locking in their bookings soon after Beijing is over."
Many homeowners, however, are holding out for a full 21-night stay, boosting their income to levels that could make a serious dent in their mortgage payments.
"I didn't think my wife would be keen, but when we saw we could charge $30,000, she figured it might just be worth it," said Chris Dyck, an accountant with an 1,800-square-foot property in Richmond. They were encouraged by reports from one of Ms. Dyck's co-workers. "A relative of a friend answered the door to their place in Whistler, and someone offered them $35,000 on the spot," Mr. Dyck said.
He doesn't think the price is unreasonable. "It's a huge inconvenience for us to move out of our home, and we should be properly compensated."
Jackie Sali, who rents out her three Whistler properties year-round using Gowhistlerbyowner.com, usually keeps her rates at the lower end of the area's price range to ensure bookings. But she has increased her rates for the Olympics and so far has a one-bedroom apartment booked to a Games worker from mid-January through to the beginning of March for $31,850.
Originally she planned to stay in her village studio apartment while she worked as a volunteer, renting out the larger home she owns in Creekside. "But I started talking to other people in Whistler about why they weren't putting their properties up for rent and they were saying they didn't want to miss the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity of being part of the Olympics," she said.
A torch-runner at the 1988 Calgary Olympics, Ms. Sali said she is now more likely to rent out the studio and move her family up for the games. "Money isn't everything," she said.
Retired Ontario businessman Alan Norton has been attending the event on and off with his family since the Montreal Games in 1976. Most hosts, he said, have been notable in their hospitality. There was the Lake Placid couple who delivered breakfast each day, the Calgarians who gave his family the use of a car at no extra charge, and the elderly Athens couple who left them fruit and pastries every day.
Beijing has proved no different. "We are seven adults and a five-month-old baby this time," Mr. Norton said before he left. "We have rented a condo three kilometres from the main stadium and on a subway line for $4,000. The owner is picking us up from the airport, buying a car seat for my baby granddaughter and giving us all brand new sheets and towels."
For 2010, he's hoping for a three-bedroom place somewhere between Vancouver and Whistler. "I think $500 per night is a reasonable price for us."
When it comes to hospitality, though, Mr. MacKenzie is not convinced that Vancouver will follow the example of previous host cities. "I think it's a little different here," he says. "The rapid real estate price rise means that many people are looking for ways to help their mortgage.
"They're not interested in making sure the guests really enjoy their stay. It's not about being an ambassador for Vancouver."

Olympic feeding frenzy hits local restaurants
Vancouver's restaurant industry is rife with rumours of Olympics 2010 deals. Everyone seems to know an owner with a six-figure deal set in stone - although when pressed for details, names and numbers suddenly become hazy.
Players Chophouse, opposite BC Place stadium, signed up Bell Canada for its hospitality headquarters way back in September last year. The exact figure is "confidential," marketing and sales director Wendy Derzai says. "But I can tell you it is very, very high."
Most restaurateurs say they have been approached by multiple organizations, looking for anything from hiring the room only, to full, exclusive food and beverage service for 17 days straight.
"Whether I provide the service, or they dry hire the room, the fee is the same," says Neil Wyles, owner of the Hamilton Street Grill, a Yaletown steakhouse. "I built in wages and gratuity compensation for my staff, [and] an expectation that whoever is here will break every glass and plate in the place, the room will need repainting, half the booths will be repaired."
Glowbal Restaurant Group's Emad Yacoub says his caterers are already booked for 2010, while his restaurants are still in negotiation. "I want to split the deal across my restaurants," he says. "Rather than book out an entire restaurant for the duration of the Games, I would rotate smaller groups, providing their VIPs with a variety of meal options, and we can still service our regular customers."
He is also moving his seafood restaurant, Coast, from Yaletown to downtown to make room for "a hip sports bar called Mix."
In Whistler, André Saint-Jacques of the Bearfoot Bistro is waiting for the Beijing dust to settle before finalizing any deals. His executive chef, Melissa Craig, will be cooking a charity dinner in Beijing after winning this year's Gold Medal Plates Canadian Culinary Championships and is in high demand on home turf.
"We have been approached by many, many people," he says. "We are looking at everything from a complete buyout for the duration, to smaller three-day deals or keeping the 40-seat wine cellar separate for our regular clients. We've been approached for private dinners in some of the bigger executive homes here and corporate catering events." Nothing is decided, he says. "In the end, I don't know what we'll do. Money talks, you know?"

Full text:   When Woody Allen started shooting in Spain, some fans grumbled. What could the maestro of Manhattan have to say about the Mediterranean? But as Globe arts reporter Gayle MacDonald discovers, the Catalan capital is the perfect steamy backdrop for the director's upcoming film - a story about tourists seduced by raw sensuality and wild emotion
It's nearly 10 p.m. in Barcelona. But after climbing a narrow tower in La Sagrada Familia - and climbing it in still roasting heat - I'm in need of some air. So I set out on a leisurely evening stroll.
I decide to take the Passeig de Gracia. This city's Champs-élysees, it takes me past more Gaudi landmarks, palatial homes set back from the boulevard. And eventually I come upon Catalunya Plaza - a famous meeting place for locals, as well as the eight million visitors who come here every year.
On this night, though, the crowd, growing by the second, is not here to snap tourist photos or meet drinking partners. They are clustered around something oddly shaped, tall - and unmistakably pink.
It's a large, inflatable penis being wielded by a group of twentysomething women cavorting on the street. And no one is the least bit offended. Not the elderly couples, who walk this city arm in arm. Not the young families, who push strollers late into the night.
This is, after all, Barcelona. Heady and hedonistic, it's a city that exudes a naughty joie de vivre and flips a finger at conventional rules: Sunbathers go bottomless (and, of course, topless); couples think nothing of putting the whole Kama Sutra on display in open plaças ; even church architecture can seem erotic.
All of which makes it the perfect horny backdrop for Woody Allen's new film. Opening this Friday, Vicky Christina Barcelona revolves around a painter (Javier Bardem) who beds not one but three women - his tempestuous ex-wife (Penelope Cruz), a soon-to-be-married American (Rebecca Hall) and her free-spirited best friend (Scarlett Johansson). And, yes, the love polygon also extends to two starlets necking.
But perhaps calling Barcelona a mere backdrop to this sultry action isn't quite right. Like Fellini's Rome, the Catalan capital is a central character in Allen's film. As he told the crowds at Cannes, Vicky Christina Barcelona is his "love letter to Barcelona, and from Barcelona to the world."
Smitten with the Catalonian capital since a visit nearly two decades ago, the 71-year-old director jumped at the opportunity to film there after being wooed by Spain's giant production company Mediapro and being handed a sizable cheque from local taxpayers.
And while some local filmmakers decried public funds going to a foreign production, supporters contend that Allen's movie is the biggest plug for Barcelona since the 1992 Olympics. "It's a huge advertisement for the city that will be seen all over the world," said the city's mayor.
The film certainly mines a number of tourist cliches. There are close-ups of the Gaudi church I climbed up, shots of Las Ramblas and enough scenes of the teeming Mercat de la Boqueria to make world-weary viewers choke on their cava.
But then Allen takes those postcard images further. He gets that Barcelona is joyously heterodox. It's a place where relationships can't be contained by mere etiquette. Dinner and evening strolls are rarely before 10 p.m. And guidebook stops aren't just a safe flirtation with foreignness - they can be opening lines for deeper seductions.
At least for those travellers willing to flirt back.
"Ah, Barcelona," Javier Bardem sighs. "It's one of my favourite places. But perhaps more than any other town in the world, it pays to know people who can show you the little squares, which are not very big and set in narrow, old alleyways, where you can go in a quiet mood and simply soak up the surroundings."
Coming from the 39-year-old Spaniard - set to become the poster boy for this city, though he was born in the Canary Islands - this is advice I take seriously. But it is my first trip to Barcelona, so I have only friendly strangers to rely on for tips on sun-drenched plazas and sexy bars.
And my own feet. As National Geographic Traveler has noted, the city is best absorbed by "dancing slowly with her, like an elusive mistress. You have to seduce her to find her secrets." So I walk; non-stop, from dawn well past dark.
Mind you, walking (let alone other forms of seduction) can feel like a chore in midsummer. So when the heat - a staggering 40 degrees - gets overwhelming, most locals head to the port.
Some put down their towels at Hotel Arts. The 483-room high-rise is a mainstay for international jet setters (Allen's entourage stayed here) and the terrace pool, right beside Frank Gehry's giant bronze fish sculpture, is prime real estate for visitors who want to get out of their rooms.
But the scene at that tony outpost is nothing compared with the beach below, where thousands of glistening bodies romp along five kilometres of sand during the day and line up (along with soccer players and models) at hot spots such as Bestial at night.
In fact, while art critic Robert Hughes has said the key to the Catalan character is the interplay between seny , usually translated as common sense, and rauxa , or uncontrollable emotion, I don't see much of the former.
At night, in particular, this city is hot. Steamy hot. Revellers toss back absinthe at tobacco-stained places such as Bar Marsella (shown in Allen's movie) and sip cool cava in the sleekly styled lobby bar at Hotel Omm. And they don't get home until well past 2, 3 - even 4 a.m.
(As for Allen, to unwind after long days of shooting he played jazz at the bar inside Casa Fuster - a five-star hotel designed by Lluis Domenech i Montane. His signature "look": a floppy green fishing hat.)
However they spend their wee hours, though, partiers all hit the sack well-fed: Food is foreplay for a night on the town, and every block, every plaza, has at least half a dozen good restaurants, with tables that offer dining by moonlight to the noise of clubs and high-spirited gossip.
One favourite strip is the Passeig de Gracia, the main thoroughfare in Eixample. It's popular among film scouts because of its treasure trove of Gaudi landmarks, but it's also lined with the most talked-about new restaurants.
For example, Tapas 24, as its name suggests, is known for to-die-for tapas. At the top of the list: Bikini Comerç, a grilled ham and cheese sandwich with a truffle and just the right amount of salt. A simple pleasure, in other words, with a bit of added sex appeal.
GET IN THE MOOD - GET LOST
But Barcelona's unique brand of sex appeal isn't just the way the city eats - or dances or struts. As everyone keeps telling me, it's the way people surrender to the moment. And the best way to experience that is to meander, to get a little lost.
Even Jordan Susselman, a young San Diego transplant who runs a tour company called Hi. This is Barcelona, suggests a fairly aimless approach to the city. That way, he says, you might stumble onto summer delights such as horchata (tiger nut milk) or discover the joy of El Raval - where things change from one street to the next, one doorway to the next.
Not all that long ago, Raval - named for an Arabic word meaning "that which is on the outside" - was a haven for heroin dealers and prostitutes. And Susselman says tourists should still hang on to their handbags at night.
But edge is also giving way to gentrification, to a gallery district whose nexus is MACBA, Barcelona's contemporary art museum, as well as scrappy spaces that share rent with hair salons, record stores and fashion designers.
Barcelona Bohos flock here for meals, too, to cafes such as El Jardi, located in the courtyard of a former hospital, or to the tiny eatery Inopia, where Albert Adrià (his big brother is the chef behind El Bulli) serves sardine sandwiches and ham croquettes.
One of Susselman's favourite watering holes is here as well. At the Bar Bodega Montse - whose dusty walls are lined with photos of 100-year-old city landmarks - you can bring in your own wine bottle and fill it from one of four wooden kegs.
(It's no Dominio de Pingus, but as Susselman says, the price is right.)
Another option is to follow the tourist trail and wander through the Barri Gottic. Visitors flock here to roam Carrer Banys Nous, a banana-shaped street lined with antique stores, each with their own specialty. One sells tin signs, another - housed in a former brothel - supplied the lace for the film Titanic .
There's also Caelum. It sells delectable cookies and pastries made by monks and nuns from across the country. Go into the basement (only open in the afternoon) and sip icy espresso under medieval arches that frame an ancient Jewish bath.
Or try Belgious, which sells ice cream in mind-boggling flavours, such as curry (ugh), red wine and Roquefort cheese.
And don't miss Carrer Petritxol: The Gottic's first pedestrian-only street, it's home to some of the city's most established galleries - including Sala Pares, where passionate Picasso (who lived nearby) had his first one-man show.
BARDEM'S BARCELONA
And what about those Bardem-worthy plaças? Those "little squares" he recommends?
For that, amble over to Gracia. Once a working class village, the neighbourhood has retained a small-town charm - and more than half a dozen squares where Catalans put up their feet after hitting the area's art-house cinema or before a night out.
One of the busiest is Plaça de Rius Taulet, overrun on balmy evenings by lovers, children and dogs.
As for Bardem himself, on breaks from shooting sultry sex scenes with his leading ladies, the Oscar-winning actor hung out in El Born, where he rented an apartment during the six weeks of filming Vicky Christina Barcelona .
Like Raval, this is an area where Susselman says you "wouldn't take your kids" a decade ago, but today it's chockablock with artists' studios and galleries like Iguapop - a showcase for some of Spain's most unconventional artists.
Which sounds cool. Then again, Barcelona can be a fickle mistress when it comes to trendy neighbourhoods. Sure, El Born may have been desirable, what, a year ago? Two? But too many suitors can be cloying - too many galleries and boutiques and bistros can take away an area's mysterious allure.
Or maybe where you go in this city really doesn't matter all that much.
If you wander with an open mind - whether into some Gaudi monument or along the beach - you may just run into some spirited women waving a giant phallus for the crowds. Or witness another moment of wild emotion, of rauxa .

Full text:   Major cities in Saskatchewan, Alberta and B.C. are overvalued by 10 per cent, economists say as key construction indicator tumbles
As Canada's housing market shows fresh signs it has exited the boom phase, Merrill Lynch economists are cautioning homeowners to expect a "sustained downturn" in prices.
Nearly every major city in the West makes the list of most vulnerable markets, in addition to Montreal and Sudbury, according to a pair of Toronto-based economists at the bank.
Soaring prices over much of the past decade have made the country's homeowners substantially richer. The big question
is whether a selloff could echo the wrenching downturn in the United States, where prices in Miami and Los Angeles have fallen as much as 28 per cent from the peak and average national prices are down 18 per cent in the past two years.
The Merrill Lynch Canada study, which predicts a retrenchment, but not of the same magnitude as in the U.S., concludes the country's housing market is now the most expensive since 1991.
Markets in Regina, Saskatoon, Vancouver, Victoria, Calgary, Edmonton, Sudbury and Montreal are all more than 10 per cent overvalued, as calculated by economists David Wolf and Carolyn Kwan.
Their analysis, which calculates fair value by using variables such as current prices, affordability and long-term average valuations, landed on the same day Statistics Canada said both residential and commercial construction intentions tumbled in June.
In sifting through recent data, the Merrill economists believe the country's housing market will suffer from excess supply and reduced demand as higher prices deter new buyers. They expect house price appreciation will stall, with western markets "most vulnerable to outright declines." Other markets exposed to downward pressure include urban condos and suburbs where commuters face higher transportation costs due to rising fuel prices.
This retrenchment won't be nearly as severe as in the U.S. though, Mr. Wolf emphasized.
"Are prices going to fall 20 per cent the way they did in the U.S.? Probably not," he said. "But it's pretty clear that things are weakening and they're going to continue weakening for some time."
Credit is the main difference between the two countries. Looser credit conditions south of the border fuelled easy lending, which in turn created excessive demand.
"We never had that kind of credit excess in Canada," Mr. Wolf said. Plus, much of this country's boom has been making up for lacklustre activity throughout the 1990s.
Now, after years of ever-pricier homes and aggressive building, scales may have tipped.
The Merrill economists are most concerned about Saskatchewan, where the doubling of house prices in Regina and Saskatoon over the past two years means, they estimate, these markets are almost 50 per cent overvalued.
In B.C., Vancouver's and Victoria's housing markets are now as much as 35 per cent overvalued, they believe. Markets in Alberta, meantime, have become slightly less overvalued in the past year.
The rest of the country looks "better balanced," they said, with housing in Toronto essentially at fair value.
Slowing activity and moderating prices would have broad economic ripples. Mr. Wolf sees cooling residential investment dampening inflation and knocking 0.6 percentage points off real gross domestic product next year.
Builders are already more cautious, with Statscan's report yesterday showing building permits fell 5.3 per cent in June - the steepest drop this year. Last week, a Canadian Real Estate Association report showed sales activity slumped 13.1 per cent in the first half of the year. National house prices, though, have so far held steady.
The head of construction powerhouse EllisDon is "very concerned" about where the Canadian economy is heading, and what it might mean for building activity.
"I am worried right across the country that things are tightening up and that a year from now we are going to see a drop-off," said Geoff Smith, the company's president and CEO.
Nowhere has the market been more wild in the past year than Saskatoon, which has bubbled with stories of bidding wars and frenzied speculators.
Yet soaring house prices may finally be deterring buyers.
"It's quiet on the buyers' side. Listings are up, sales are down," said Ken Glauser, associate broker at Henry Moulin Realty Inc. "Surprisingly, the overall average price isn't down though."
He expects a slight cooling-off in prices, but says a strong local economy means they won't fall much. And he's rather relieved the market is losing some of its fevered pitch.
Nowadays, "people can go home and think about their bids overnight," Mr. Glauser said. "Last year, they could hardly get back to their car to think about it."

Full text:   A U.S. non-profit moves and rebuilds unwanted houses, then sells them to people priced out of the market. Donors get a tax break
It might be the most politically-correct housing development on the planet.
In Raleigh, where hundreds of old houses have been torn down to make way for bigger, fancier new ones, one neighbourhood stands out. Called Barrington Village, it comprises 24 homes that were saved from demolition by a non-profit group and moved to the wooded, six-acre property. The houses, dating from the 1940s to 1960s, were placed on new foundations and fitted with identical front porches.
Reusing the houses kept construction debris out of dumps in a city where every new landfill is a battle. The houses, which go for $89,000 to $185,000 (U.S.), are sold to moderate-income people who have been priced out of the Raleigh market. And some of the workers come from a homeless mission, getting on-the-job training that results in letters of reference for future employment; other workers are "at risk" youth from a program that teaches construction skills.
Barrington Village is an extreme example of trying to save old houses rather than tear them down. For homeowners and developers, the tactic can be a good move: They often receive tax deductions, their lots are cleared free of charge and they may avoid criticism from neighbours and preservationists concerned about saving old structures.
The National Trust for Historic Preservation recently identified more than 500 communities in 40 states where homes in historic neighbourhoods were being torn down, compared with 100 communities in 20 states in 2002.
Services that buy house parts from people who are remodelling or razing have proliferated in recent years. These "rebuilding centres," typically non-profits, resell the old windows, doors and cabinets to the public. But reusing an entire house is more unusual.
In Martha's Vineyard, the Affordable Housing Fund has moved and renovated seven houses so far, though they weren't sited in one location. Habitat for Humanity, which builds houses from scratch for low-income people, has moved a few houses that were slated for teardown, including four relocated to one North Carolina development, says Susan Levy, executive director of Habitat's Orange County, N.C., affiliate.
The non-profit organization in Raleigh, Builders of Hope, is one of the only groups moving and renovating houses on a large scale. And there's such a supply of teardowns in the city that it felt confident enough to break ground on a second development last month. Called Green Hope Village, it goes even further than the first one: All the houses will be made super energy-efficient to meet the standards of a local green-building authority that guarantees monthly heating and cooling bills under $40.
Barrington Village, meantime, will soon have playground equipment donated by a developer who needed to get rid of it, and its traffic circle will be landscaped with a picnic table, apple trees and an herb garden designed free by a local landscaper.
One Economy, a non-profit group in Washington, D.C., put in a wireless Internet system and Builders of Hope is working to get residents recycled cars from individuals and dealerships.
There have been some hitches: Moving the houses doesn't solve the problem some neighbourhoods have with out-of-scale McMansions going up. Federal tax deductions for people who can afford teardowns don't always sit well in Raleigh, where property taxes have risen 40 per cent on average over the past two years. And the "village," like many new developments, is in an isolated pocket, unconnected to other neighbourhoods and lacking stores.
But that doesn't dampen enthusiasm among the new homeowners. "Just to be able to own a home is a feeling of jubilation," says Phil Brickle, a 53-year-old minister who was Barrington Village's first resident.
Mr. Brickle lived in a nearby trailer for nine years after a stint with his parents and 20 years as a heroin user before that, he says. The 1,500-square-foot house, which he bought for $139,000, is the first he has ever owned; it has an office, a lavishly decorated guest bedroom and a master bedroom with a walk-in closet. The solidly built kitchen cabinets stayed with the house when it was moved, as did the hardwood floors and crown moulding.
Mr. Brickle's house was one of five donated by Kane Realty Corp., which needed to make room for an office and retail development. "It was such a great opportunity to do the right thing," says Mike Smith, the company's president. And it made sense financially: Kane saved the cost of bulldozing the houses and likely will get a tax deduction.
Word of Kane Realty's donation travelled to Betty Ann Lennon, a 62-year-old "stay-at-home grandmother" who had just bought a 1950s ranch house because she and her husband fell in love with the lot. They wanted to build something larger but were wary of tearing down the house. Now, the neighbours are thrilled that the old house was rescued and the couple was pleased their lot was cleared free of charge - "a lot easier than having a bulldozer," she says.
Laura Clark, a 38-year-old stay-at-home mom whose ranch house is being prepped for the move to Builders of Hope's new community, agrees. She and her husband, a surgeon, hired an architect to help design a 4,000-sq.-ft., traditional-style home. When the architect told them that it would be impossible to redo the existing house and that they should just "scrape" the lot, they were dismayed.
Then they discovered that by donating the house they could get a federal tax deduction of 80 per cent of the home's $145,000 appraised value, and save $25,000 by not having to bulldoze. (The amount of deduction varies according to a donor's adjusted gross income.)
"It gives you such a great feeling when you know you're not destroying it and you know it will go on to be someone else's house," Ms. Clark says.
The idea for a recycled housing community arose four years ago when Builders of Hope founder Nancy Murray was putting an addition on her house. Frustrated that her contractor, John Jenkins, was taking much longer than planned because of a shortage of subcontractors, Ms. Murray, 41, asked the contractor to show her how to help. She loved the construction work so much that when the project was finished, she bought a foreclosed house and subdivided the land for three homes, but she needed to move the existing house.
The house mover, Sammy Jackson, told Ms. Murray that there were dozens of houses slated for teardown that she could move and renovate. One idea led to another, and Builders of Hope was born when Ms. Murray started moving homes to another property - one she donated to the non-profit. Mr. Jenkins, Mr. Jackson and Ms. Murray now work full time for it (though she says she doesn't yet get paid).
rs. Murray has more schemes in mind. She's in talks with Habitat for Humanity about a joint effort in Chapel Hill, N.C., where Habitat has purchased a lot for a 50-house subdivision. A third of the homes in the envisioned project could be relocated ones rehabbed by Builders of Hope, she says.
And when a developer offered her a bunch of unwanted duplexes, she started negotiations with another developer that owns 56 vacant lots across the street from Barrington Village that are zoned for multifamily housing.
There she envisions a community for elderly people who need affordable housing but don't want a single-family home.

Full text:   Nautilus
Location: Etobicoke
Builder/developer: Monarch Corp.
Size: 465 to 1,418 square feet
Price: $166,490 to $821,990
Sales centre: 68 Marine Parade Dr., east of Park Lawn Road, south of Lake Shore Boulevard. Open Monday to Thursday, noon to 6 p.m.; weekends and holidays, noon to 5 p.m.
Contact: (416) 495-3544 or www.monarchgroup.net
With construction under way on the fourth tower at its waterfront development in Etobicoke, and about 80 per cent of the building's units sold, Monarch Corp. is offering incentives to speed up the sale of the remaining suites.
For one year, monthly maintenance fees - 41 cents a square foot - will be waived.
Also, the Oceana 722 model - a one-bedroom suite with a den, large windows and a wraparound balcony - is being offered for $309,990 on any floor it's available.
"It's a bargain," says Mirella Sarrapochiello, who is the manager of marketing for Monarch's high-rise division. "You are buying this suite on a higher floor, but at the price of [one on] a lower floor."
In addition, the builder will take an additional 2 per cent off purchase prices, which range from $166,490 for a 465-square-foot model to $821,990 for a 1,418-square-foot plan.
The 39-storey condo, called Nautilus, will sit on a three-storey podium, making it taller than previous phases of the project, known as Waterview.
Buyers at the 395-unit building have included young professionals, people downsizing and local residents, the builder says.
"What stands out is the expansive views of the lake purchaser's will have," Ms. Sarrapochiello notes. Inspired by its setting on Humber Bay, Graziani and Corazza Architects Inc. have given Nautilus a unique design that includes six-foot-deep balconies with blue and green glass sections arranged in a sweeping pattern to suggest the movement of a ship's sail, she says.
Also a hit among buyers, according to Ms. Sarrapochiello, has been the site's proximity to the Martin Goodman Trail, marinas, parks and cultural attractions.
Nautilus will have a number of conveniences, such as ground-floor shops, and recreational amenities that will include cyber and sports lounges, a theatre, library and private dining room. The building's party room will feature a caterer's kitchen, bar and access to a landscaped garden with private cabana and barbecue stations. Among the fitness facilities will be a cardio, yoga and aerobics area with commercial-grade equipment, a pool and saunas.
There also will be concierge service in the lobby, two guest suites and a carwash bay.
Principal rooms will have nine-foot ceilings, and kitchens will feature granite countertops and stainless-steel appliances.
Units will come with a locker, and in most cases, parking. Hydro and cable will be extra.
Completion is expected by December, 2010.

Abstract: The reason for their appeal to Yum is simple economics: Delivery-only locations, unlike fine-dining establishments, don't have to occupy prime (and expensive) real estate and can still pull in 60 to 70 per cent of the revenue of fine-dining locations. Yum's China division saw its operating profit jump 38 per cent in the second quarter, and Pizza Hut was the division's fastest-growing brand.

Full text:   Restaurant giant Yum Brands Inc. is betting that China's growing middle class, which continues to demand more of the typical Western middle-class lifestyle, will develop a taste for one of the favourite American convenience foods - pizza, delivered.
Pizza delivery, ubiquitous in the U.S., is a new concept in China, where dining out has long been seen as a form of conspicuous consumption. Until recently, Yum focused on positioning its Pizza Hut locations as a "five-star experience, [with a] three-star price" that would attract Chinese consumers looking for a night on the town. But as China's growing wealth swells - along with its legions of harried office workers who have less and less time to cook at home - delivery is beginning to look like a faster way to grow the Pizza Hut brand, and consumers have begun to respond.
As a result, over the past year, Yum has ramped up delivery operations in the country by building call centres, securing a nationwide telephone number and constructing new locations at an expeditious rate.
"We think we could build thousands of these," Yum chief financial officer Rick Carucci said. The company currently has 61 delivery-only locations, a 49-per-cent increase from a year ago, and plans to continue at that rate for the next year.
The reason for their appeal to Yum is simple economics: Delivery-only locations, unlike fine-dining establishments, don't have to occupy prime (and expensive) real estate and can still pull in 60 to 70 per cent of the revenue of fine-dining locations. Yum's China division saw its operating profit jump 38 per cent in the second quarter, and Pizza Hut was the division's fastest-growing brand.
Yum will need that growth to fuel its stock, which has fallen in recent months from a high of $41.73 on April 30. Yum has a forward price-earnings ratio of 18.8, according to FactSet Research, higher than those of competitor Domino's Pizza Inc. , with a 14.2 P/E, and Papa John's Pizza International Inc. , at 16.7.
To be sure, Yum faces risks in its expansion. Domino's Pizza, the dominant delivery-only brand in the United States, has been slow to move into the Chinese market, noting the lack of a convenience culture that would demand food delivery. But that is changing: Domino's has built central delivery commissaries in Shanghai and Beijing, a sign they will build out in the near future.
"I think for a couple of years they were skeptical that there was going to be a delivery business there," Bank of America analyst Joseph Buckley said of Domino's. "Now they think there is. It could be because of what Pizza Hut is doing."
Yum, whose largely autonomous China group's slogan is "Rooted in China, Part of China," says it is just following the market.
When lawyer Zhan Zhao moved to Beijing in 2002 after spending his teenage years and getting his education in the U.S., he was shocked to find no food delivery service was available.
"I was a lawyer working long hours and new to China, so a service of convenience was something that I really needed to help adjust to the other realities of modern-day China," said Mr. Zhao, 32, an associate at New York-based Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom LLP. To fill the gap, Mr. Zhao started a delivery service, Beijing Goodies, to deliver food at an additional price from Beijing restaurants. After a rocky start in May of 2002, the business has taken off in recent years. Today, the company has 7,000 registered users in Beijing - and Mr. Zhao, who now lives in Shanghai, sees food delivery as a growth market.
"Food delivery will only become more and more popular, especially for the local white collars, as the Chinese consuming public continues to work longer and longer hours," Mr. Zhao said.
Yum's recent television advertising campaign in China makes a similar case. One ad, for example, shows a young mother rushing from work to the market, cooking dinner and doing dishes, contrasted with a serene woman stretching and enjoying her afternoon. The serene woman has already ordered pizza, and as the ad shows, a moped-mounted delivery man is on the way.
Papa John's, which recently opened its 100th restaurant in China, has also noticed an increase in delivery orders, according to David Flanery, the company's chief financial officer and head of its international operations.
"The delivery percentage has probably doubled over the past two to three years," Mr. Flanery said. "You go through those cities and see apartment building after apartment building and you go, 'You know, those people have to eat and more of them have enough money to go to a restaurant and have something delivered.' "
Mr. Flanery said Papa John's is more than happy to follow Yum's lead in the country, where Yum, as a company, has a massive head start. Yum was the first Western fast food company to gain entrance to China in the 1980s, and its KFC chain is one of the most recognized Western brands in the country, with 2,264 locations as of June 30.
Mr. Carucci said he expects Yum to ramp up the building of Pizza Hut delivery locations over the next year or so, moving into more and more second-tier cities, with the eventual goal of China being a larger market than the United States.
"We're off to the races on delivery," Mr. Carucci said.

Abstract: It was one of those bombing missions that earned him the U.S. Air Force's Distinguished Flying Cross with Three Oak Leaf Clusters. His mission was to bomb petroleum refineries in Ploesti, Romania. As one of the enemy's main sources of oil, it was a frequent target. His plane was hit by enemy fire, his gunner killed and he lost an engine. To return to base in North Africa, Mr. Hill had to fly over the Adriatic Sea and part of Italy. He gave his crew the option of bailing out or sticking with him.

Full text:   Rejected by the RCAF, he broke the rules and joined the U.S. force to fly 31 missions. Later, he turned a small family-run company into a Saskatchewan business empire
As a young man, Fred Hill was so determined to fight Adolf Hitler that when the Canadian military rejected him he signed up with the U.S. air force and became a top bomber pilot, a decorated war hero and an honorary American citizen.
Being Canadian, he was not eligible to enlist in the U.S. armed forces during the Second World War so he fudged his citizenship status until the night before he was to receive his wings. His commanding officer called him in to ask for proof of citizenship. Mr. Hill finally came clean. "I guess the Air Force has made a big mistake and trained me to be a pilot and not a citizen," the gutsy Canuck told his superior.
"You're under arrest," he was told.
Not knowing what else to do with the alien before him, the officer phoned General Hap Arnold, the Chief of Staff of the U.S. Army Air Forces. Once he heard the story, Gen. Arnold got the recruit on the blower and asked in very graphic language what he thought he was doing. The reply: "I'm determined to fight Hitler and I want to preserve freedom in the world. That's my motivation and that's why I'm here."
The general was impressed because he then called some important Washington politicians and Mr. Hill was made an honorary American citizen on the spot. He graduated the next day at the top of his class.
Using his keen intellect, courage and lots of gall, Mr. Hill realized his goal of fighting Hitler. Upon his return to Canada after the war, those same qualities helped him turn a small family-run company into The Hill Companies, a business empire with interest in commercial and residential real estate, oil and gas, broadcasting, insurance and manufacturing. The personal side of the Canadian tycoon shunned the spotlight on his philanthropic work. He used his wealth to help thousands of young people achieve an education and extended a helping hand to countless of society's poor and most vulnerable.
Fred Hill grew up in Regina where he was the third of four sons of Walter and Grace Hill. In 1903, Walter Hill, a schoolteacher, and his business partner E. A. McCallum, founded McCallum Hill Ltd., specializing in insurance and real estate. The company was best known for developing the Lakeview subdivision in south Regina. By 1912 the company was the largest land developer in Western Canada. It put up a 10-storey office building, the McCallum Hill Building, which for many years was Saskatchewan's tallest structure. The company also sold the provincial government the land on which the legislature now sits.
Mr. Hill graduated from Campion High School after rheumatic fever caused him to lose almost a year of schooling. He obtained a bachelor of arts from the University of Saskatchewan, graduating first in his class, and then enlisted in the RCAF after Canada entered the war in 1939. Six months into his training, he was deemed medically unfit to serve because the rheumatic fever had left him with a heart condition. Disappointed at being discharged, he enrolled in the MBA program at Harvard Business School in Boston. When the U.S. entered the war in 1941, he went to the nearest recruiting office and volunteered. He was trained at five different bases. With each move, his file was reviewed and he was asked for proof of citizenship. Somehow, he kept making excuses for not providing the document.
While training in Yuma, Ariz., he was given a weekend leave and told he could spend it anywhere in America. He flew to Washington where he had heard women outnumbered men 15-to-one. On a blind date, he met Margaret Mulvihill, a young woman from Winnipeg who was working at the British Embassy. It was love at first sight. Mr. Hill flew back to Washington every weekend and five dates later they married in December, 1943.
After he received his wings, Mr. Hill went on to fly B-17 Flying Fortress bombers as part of the 8th Air Force in England and the 15th Air Force in Italy. He was eligible for a discharge after 26 missions, but signed up for a second tour of duty and flew five more missions.
It was one of those bombing missions that earned him the U.S. Air Force's Distinguished Flying Cross with Three Oak Leaf Clusters. His mission was to bomb petroleum refineries in Ploesti, Romania. As one of the enemy's main sources of oil, it was a frequent target. His plane was hit by enemy fire, his gunner killed and he lost an engine. To return to base in North Africa, Mr. Hill had to fly over the Adriatic Sea and part of Italy. He gave his crew the option of bailing out or sticking with him. They chose the latter and threw out everything they could to lighten the aircraft and so use less fuel. A very religious man, Mr. Hill had christened his plane "Our Lady" and had it decorated with a painting of the Virgin Mary. "Our Lady is going to get us through this," he told his crew. With fuel almost exhausted, the plane barely made it back and caught fire on landing. Luckily, the whole crew got out safely.
Physically uninjured but psychologically exhausted after his many missions, he was discharged six months before the Germans surrendered in May, 1945. He spent six months in a convalescence hospital and then returned to Harvard, completing his MBA in 1947, by which time he and his wife had the first of their five children.
Back in Saskatchewan, things had changed under the CCF government led by Tommy Douglas.
During his absence, the family insurance company had been absorbed by the provincial government and the family holdings had been reduced to little more than the McCallum Hill Building. In 1950, he and his father started a bonding company, Western Surety Company of Canada, which grew and prospered.
In 1953, Mr. Hill took over the company from his father and led it through tremendous expansion. He developed several subdivisions including Hillsdale, the first built in Saskatchewan since the 1920s. He also participated in the discovery of a light-oil well in Creelman in southeast Saskatchewan. This was an important discovery for two reasons: It was the first light oil discovered in the province, and it was done so by a new and small company - the major companies having pulled out because of the Douglas government.
Through the years, the Hill family business continued to expand at a steady rate. In 1976, Mr. Hill decided to go on a campaign of diversification. He had been encouraged in this by his son Paul, who had just returned home working in Toronto.
The company went from a Regina-only company into a Canada-wide empire with additional interests in Texas and Arizona. The company survived the real-estate collapse of the late eighties and nineties, unlike many of its contemporaries. "What saved us was that we were diversified both in terms of geography and industry," said Paul Hill, who describes his father as a very good mentor.
In building up the company, Fred Hill redefined Regina's downtown skyline with the construction of the Hill Centre, a two-tower office complex on the site of the original McCallum Hill Building.
"There's no doubt that Fred Hill's influence is certainly seen in Regina," said Mayor Pat Fiacco. "The face of Regina would be quite different without Fred, no question."
Even so, Mr. Hill was interested in more than the bricks and mortar that changed Regina into a thriving urban centre, Mr. Fiacco said. He cared deeply for its people, quietly donating to a number of local charities and providing corporate sponsorship for major events.
While Mr. Hill tolerated the big splashes he made in business news, he chose to keep quiet about his charitable work. Perhaps his greatest philanthropic legacy is his support of Athol Murray College of Notre Dame in Wilcox, 41 kilometres south of Regina. Mr. Hill was a close friend of Monsignor Athol Murray, the school's founder. When he died in 1975, the school was in bad shape financially and its buildings were in drastic need of modernization. Mr. Hill stepped in to keep the school afloat and remained involved for the rest of his life, said college president David Howie. "Without Fred's financial leadership, without his commitment to the college, Notre Dame would not exist today - certainly not in the same form," he said.
A devout Catholic who attended daily mass, his deep faith guided his life, said his friend Monsignor Ken Miller of the Archdiocese of Regina. "He worked out of a strong faith perspective and translated that into many, many practical ways."
One example was when he intervened to solve transportation problems in bringing the World Youth Day cross to Canada for World Youth Day in 2002. Another, was his on-going support for Mother Teresa. They had met in the late eighties and she would call him if she needed help. He frequently provided her with transportation and frequently flew places with her.
"He was a man with a passion. He was a very principled man and very deeply rooted in his faith, his love for God and for humanity," Father Miller said. "He did not give the impression he was better than anyone else, but he simply lived out his convictions and he was there to make a difference."
Mr. Hill was highly respected and honoured for both his business acumen and philanthropy. He served for many years on the Papal Foundation in Rome which raises money to help the world's poor. For his humanitarianism and generosity, Pope Benedict XVI appointed him Knight Commander of the Order of St. Gregory the Great, the highest honour the Catholic Church can bestow on a layman. Other honours include the Order of Canada in 1986, the Queen's Golden Jubilee Medal, the 125th Anniversary of the Confederation of Canada Medal, the Saskatchewan Order of Merit and the Knights of Malta's Cross of Merit.
In the early 1980s, Mr. Hill began winding down his role in the family business and by 1995 had handed over the helm to Paul Hill, who is now president and CEO of The Hill Companies and its primary operating entity, Harvard Development Inc.
FRED HILL
Frederick Hill was born Sept. 2, 1920, in Regina. He died July 13, 2008, at home in Regina of heart failure. He was 87. He is survived by sons Paul, Terrence, and Daniel, daughter Marylyn Horsman, 14 grandchildren and 16 great-grandchildren. He was predeceased by wife Margaret in July, 1998, and by daughter Colleen Hill Smith in June.

Full text:   FIVE RING CIRCUS
Myths and Realities
of the Olympic Games
By Christopher A. Shaw
New Society, 321 pages, $19.95
It is Sunday and, as I write, my partner worships at our basement shrine. The service, broadcast from the European Alps, has been taking place for two hours. He flees from me for the last crucial parts, when "category three climbs" separate men and boys. Who will the saviour be? It's Frank Schleck of Luxembourg, robbing Aussie Cadel Evans of the maillot jaune . Oh what a passion play this bike race is!
There are complex and simple reasons we love sport - watching it and doing it - so in 1896, when France's Baron de Coubertin decided the world needed to bring back the Ancient Olympics so Earthlings would come together in peace and international understanding, he started a competition of passion, love, celebration, excellence, hate, corruption, fraud, greed and cheating.
Christopher Shaw, an ophthalmology professor at University of British Columbia, founding member of the No Games 2010 Coalition and spokesman for 2010 Watch, has tried to capture the latter descriptors in Five Ring Circus , but has failed to "podium" - an irritating verb dreamed up to describe a top-three finish. And nothing else counts.
Shaw is a researcher and an activist, but he is not a writer, and doesn't know how to tell the fraud-and-corruption story that appears to be the Vancouver Olympics, mainly because he didn't have the right help. Where are the investigative journalists in the Republic of B.C., the ones who know well that the Olympics are a façade for real-estate deals and a constant commercial for multinational corporations? And where was Shaw's editor?
If I were editing Shaw's work, a lot of "100 per cent post-consumer waste" paper would have been saved by disallowing his opinion of what people look like (verboten), what he thought they were thinking (verboten) and what he thought was probably going to happen (verboten), and struck all arguments already made in Chapter Whatever. Readers may feel as if they're skiing through slush because of the repetition.
It's an important story that needed to be told directly and impartially, with graphs and photos, not in a convoluted, ideological manner. Such lines as "Somewhere in Lausanne, I suspect there is the equivalent of 'Bidding on the Olympic Games for Dummies' in which the IOC lays out suggestions for how to run a bid, how to deal with the press, how to talk to politicians, what to say to jittery citizens and how to undercut any opposition" shouldn't exist. Either there is written material or there isn't. If you can't find it, don't say you suspect it exists. The book is filled with Shaw's conspiratorial-sounding suspicions that hide the excellent information he dug up through Freedom of Information requests and other sleuthing.
Most important to me is the Callaghan Valley fiasco he unearthed. This spring, I skied the Olympic trails there, southeast of Whistler, where the 2010 Nordic ski events will take place. It had been a pristine forest with endless snow, but still felt remote and magical. Only one tiny lodge with no electricity; a solid 12-km ski up the mountain. Perfect.
But local skiers worried that a big resort was on its way. Shaw tells us land has been traded from the Squamish and Lil'wat First Nations for "various smaller parcels outside the Callaghan in exchange for dropping claims in the valley. They wouldn't lose it all, however: There was room for a golf course in the southern part of the valley that they would be allowed to build and operate."
Squamish elder Harriet Nahanee would have none of this, nor could she countenance the Sea to Sky Highway crashing through Eagleridge, an old-growth arbutus and cedar area, home to countless animals. She camped at Eagleridge until the police moved in and carted her off to jail. She refused to apologize and spent two weeks in detention. Harriet Nahanee died of pneumonia a few days after she was released. For this story alone, please read this book.
Squamish drummers and dancers performed at the ski races last spring. They were talented, and people enjoyed the performance, but none were skiing, despite the "legacy" VANOC promise of bringing elite-level sport to first nations children. Will first nations be carted out as "drums and feathers," as Mohawk and former Olympic kayaking gold medalist Alwyn Morris calls their anointed role in CanMyth, or will they have real access to the land of their ancestors to kick and glide silently through their forests once the five-ring circus comes and goes in 2010?
Laura Robinson is covering her fourth Olympics in Beijing. She coaches the Anishinaabe Racers, a First Nations Nordic ski team in Cape Croker, Ont.

Full text:   With Porto Montenegro, Canadian Peter Munk intends to turn a sleepy Balkan country into the new 'it' destination for the world's superyachts and their ultrarich owners
Peter Munk and I are plunked in the library of the "Te Manu," a spotless white floating palace built in Italy, owned by a Mexican, named after the Polynesian word for "bird" and chartered for the week by the chairman and acting CEO of Barrick Gold and his family.
The yacht is anchored in Budva, a medieval town turned bustling resort on the coast of Montenegro, one of the breakaway republics of the shredded Yugoslavia. It has four levels, a crew of 11 and an interior clad with pear, cherry and walnut panelling. At 49.4 metres (160 feet), it is one of the biggest and most expensive of its kind in the rarefied world of superyachts - generally defined as crewed pleasure boats of 30 metres or longer. This baby rents for $175,000 to $210,000 (U.S.) a week.
On this hot summer day the Te Manu is more than a boat. It is also Mr. Munk's office. But the affairs of the world's biggest gold company are not on his mind. Porto Montenegro is. The table next to the library is strewn with notes, plans and diagrams for the superyacht marina and luxury resort that is the billionaire's newest and most glamorous project.
He and his high-profile backers recently became Montenegro's biggest foreign investors, with their EUR260-million-plus ($405-million) plan to make Porto Montenegro the Mediterranean's, perhaps the world's, premier superyacht destination.
Mr. Munk is tackling this project at 80, making him one of the world's oldest CEOs. Porto Montenegro proves he's one of the most energetic too. "Peter Munk is amazing," says fellow Canadian gold magnate Pierre Lassonde, the former president of Newmont Gold. "He will be 81 this fall and he is still building projects. My definition of young is when your coefficient of dreams to memories is greater than one. Peter only talks about the future. The past rarely comes into his conversation."
Porto Montenegro will transform the Montenegrin economy for the better, Mr. Munk promises. "It will improve the prosperity of the country and raise its status internationally," he says.
But the project has had a rough start. Thousands of Montenegrins took to the streets in protest when word got out that the old Arsenal navy yard would be recast as a playground for the idle rich. Some locals think Munk & Co. is building something akin to a gated community for floating Russian billionaires - Russian tourists and investors are already so thick on the ground that the country is known as "Moscow by the Med." Marine biologists fear the yacht harbour will damage the already stressed ecology of the Bay of Kotor, the Med's only fjord and one of the loveliest anchorages on the planet.
Montenegro presses against Croatia, Bosnia, Serbia and Albania on the southern fringes of the Dalmatian Coast. The seaside is heaven. Green mountains plunge into the Adriatic, the water is cerulean blue and unsullied. Ancient towns, some fortified, dot the shores. Hotels, restaurants and shops are springing up everywhere, but the densities (and the prices) are nowhere near the horrific levels of France's Côte d'Azur.
If Mr. Munk gets his way - there is no reason to think he won't, given the money already invested and the approvals obtained - the Te Manu won't stick out from the crowd at Porto Montenegro, some 15 kilometres north of Budva. The Bay of Kotor marina will have berths for 650 yachts, 150 of them superyachts. Boats as long as 150 metres could be accommodated in a pinch.
Oliver Corlette explains why a marina capable of taking that many superyachts will be sure to find an eager market. He is the Australian-born, 33-year-old managing director of Porto Montenegro and came into the Munk family fold through the New York office of Onex, controlled by Gerry Schwartz, where he worked on the private equity team with Anthony Munk, Peter's son. Anthony is a Porto Montenegro investor.
Running out of room
Mr. Corlette says there is simply no room anywhere for the new flotilla of superyachts. Antibes, in the south of France, is probably the Med's biggest superyacht marina; it can accommodate only a few dozen of the biggest boats. The problem is that superyachts are being pumped out like doughnuts and are matching their owners' egos in size. "The modern yachts are like ships," he says. "Harbours like Monaco and Antibes were created at a time when 30 metres was considered huge. It's not any more."
At last count, more than 900 superyachts were under construction as the new millionaires and billionaires from Russia, India, China and parts in between plunked down deposits on the ultimate status symbols. Porto Montenegro will be able to soak up a good number of these boats once the marina is finished in a couple of years.
Mr. Munk says the economics of marina ownership are irresistible. Marinas are like hotels in the sense the guest rents a small bit of real estate - a dock in the captain's case. Hotels, an industry he knows well, require extensive refurbishing to remain competitive. The non-stop capital expenditures drain cash flow. "I realized the port business is like the hotel business, except there are no capital expenditures after you build the cement docks," he says.
A year lease on a superyacht dock would start at EUR100,000 or so. But it gets better - the yachts need to be cleaned, fuelled, repaired and refurbished. Superyachts, says Mr. Corlette, cost about EUR1-million a metre to build. The annual operating bill works out to about 10 per cent of the construction cost - the tab to run a 40-metre yacht would come to EUR4-million a year. Porto Montenegro hopes to snag much of this spending. It's why Mr. Munk hopes to become a partner in the commercial shipyard, called Bijela, across the bay from Porto Montenegro, and convert it into a yacht-repair business.
Mr. Munk landed Porto Montenegro through a combination of luck, good timing and impeccable connections.
He has chartered yachts for much of his adult life and he remembers the time several years ago when he kissed off Monaco, the packed-to-the-gunwales Mediterranean anchorage of the yachting elite. He jumped overboard for a swim, felt something strange brush his skin and realized he had had a distasteful encounter with a condom.
No more Monaco. But where was a boat-loving billionaire to go? It wasn't long before he found a potential yachties' paradise in a broken half-country called Montenegro. "I didn't even know where Montenegro was," he says.
About four years ago, at a dinner party in London, he was approached by a friend who told him he should invest in Montenegro, then still attached to Serbia and going nowhere, thanks to the economic sanctions imposed on Serbia and Montenegro in the 1990s, when war was ripping the Western Balkans apart. "I said forget it - it's not even a real country," Mr. Munk told him.
Golden opportunity
But hard-luck countries often present gorgeous investment opportunities and Mr. Munk soon changed his mind. He called Robert McDougall, Canada's ambassador in Belgrade. "The ambassador said Montenegro is going to be independent and was convinced it would become like Monaco," Mr. Munk says. "I trusted him."
Another phone call was made by Mr. Munk's friend Oleg Deripaska, the Russian billionaire and owner of Basic Element, the powerful industrial group that last year invested $1.5-billion (Canadian) in Canada's Magna International auto parts company and bought Montenegro's aluminum smelter, called KAP, the year before. "Oleg made the first phone call to the prime minister [of Montenegro, Milo Djukanovic] and opened the door for me," he says.
Before he knew it, Mr. Munk was flying over the tiny country of 700,000 people in a military helicopter, peering down at potential development sites. And there it was - the Bay of Kotor. "I had never seen a place like this," he says. "I fell in love with it."
The bay is a geographical wonder. The English poet Lord Byron called it "the most beautiful encounter between the land and the sea." Its steep, rugged mountains frame a natural harbour that is well shielded from the Adriatic and has about 100 kilometres of coastline. The bay takes the rough shape of a figure eight, with the inner and outer portions pinched in the middle by a narrows.
The inner bay has a delicate ecosystem. It is fed by mountain springs, producing brackish water. It is also home to two postcard-perfect medieval towns, Kotor itself and nearby Perast, both ruled by Venice from the 1400s to the late 1700s. Kotor features a UNESCO-protected fortified wall that snakes for four kilometres over its mountain backdrop. Perast is famous for its baroque palaces and churches.
The outer bay has been prized as naval base since the Roman empire. In the Middle Ages, it was a Venetian military outpost. In the late 1800s, the Bay of Kotor became one of the three bases of the Austro-Hungarian navy. After the end of the First World War in 1918, it became part of Yugoslavia. Josip Broz Tito, the country's leader after the Second World War, employed it as the port of the Yugoslav Navy. Later, after passing through the hands of Serbia and then Montenegro, the ships and submarines became idle. The long, skinny Arsenal base, which covers 24 hectares near the town of Tivat, was rotting away, though it still employed 480 workers when Mr. Munk first saw it.
Where the locals saw decay, Mr. Munk saw a seaside ribbon of yachts, luxury hotels, condos, restaurants, casinos and a golf course - the "next Monaco," as Mr. Corlette puts it. Mr. Munk convinced the Montenegrin government that turning the Bay of Kotor into an elite tourist destination was the proper strategy - the small country didn't have the infrastructure for mass tourism. Somewhere between 3,000 and 5,000 jobs would be created.
Mr. Munk flew in George Nicholson, the chairman of George Nicholson International, the best-known yacht management and brokerage company, to see the Arsenal site early last year. Mr. Nicholson declared it ideal for superyachts. "George measured the docks," says Mr. Munk. "We went to Kotor and Budva and he said it was like St. Tropez in the 1940s."
The Montenegrin prime minister, Mr. Djukanovic was courted by Mr. Munk and became a friend - "I love the man," the Canadian executive says (the prime minister and his wife were lunch guests on the Te Manu on the day I interviewed Mr. Munk). A tender was called and Mr. Munk's holding company, Adriatic Marinas, won three consecutive 30-year property leases - effectively ownership - for a relatively small amount of money. In exchange, Adriatic Marinas made commitments to buy out the Arsenal naval workers, pay for the environmental cleanup and the like. Mr. Munk says he is investing EUR50-million to EUR75-million of his own money into the project.
All-star investors
He owns about 54 per cent of Adriatic Marinas. The rest is held by an all-star team of investors. They include Mr. Deripaska; Anthony Munk; Nathaniel Rothschild, the Atticus Capital partner and the man in line to become the fifth Baron Rothschild; Lord Jacob Rothschild, Nathaniel's father; Bernard Arnault, the French billionaire who is chairman of the luxury goods group LVMH; and Sandor Demjan, the chairman of TriGranit, one of the largest property developers in Central and Eastern Europe.
Mr. Munk owns about 18 per cent of TriGranit, where Nathaniel Rothschild is also an investor; the Hungarian company will handle construction at Porto Montenegro. The World Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) are sinking small fortunes into local water, sewage, roads and electricity systems.
News of the Porto Montenegro project and the mysterious (to the Montenegrins) clan of wealthy investors triggered fear and loathing in the country. "The resistance was huge," Mr. Munk says. "A lot of the [foreigners] they had been exposed to were rip-off artists."
About 3,500 Montenegrins took to the streets in Tivat to protest the loss of the Arsenal jobs. "The people were very emotional," says Dragan Kankaras, 48, the bearded Tivat mayor. "The Arsenal existed for 120 years and it was the biggest employer in the region. People were afraid of change."
Some Montenegrins suspected the prime minister didn't strike the best deal for the citizens - the government has no direct investment or board governance role in Porto Montenegro, though all the zoning and planning had to be approved by the government. While some admire Mr. Djukanovic as the father of the newly independent Montenegro, others think he is not to be trusted. Last summer Italian prosecutors accused him of conspiring with the Mafia to smuggle cigarettes into the European Union between 1994 and 2002. He denies the charges. He also sued a local newspaper whose editor claims he was beaten up on Mr. Djukanovic's orders.
Montenegro's opposition, led by Nebojsa Medojevic has said he sees the super-rich snapping up the country's prime assets in "colonial" style and has accused the government of corruption in development projects.
The good news for Mr. Munk and his backers is that the Porto Montenegro protests are melting away as the lure of new jobs captures the Montenegrins' imagination and the Munk goodwill machine, which includes scholarships, English lessons and university support, rolls forward. "There are only a few who have hard feelings about the project now," says Mr. Kankaras, the Tivat mayor.
The Arsenal naval yard, where Porto Montenegro is to be built, is in a sorry state. The remnants of the once proud Yugoslav and Serbian navies await their appointment with the cutting torch.
Submarine No. 831, a black, Sava Class machine commissioned in 1978, lies rusting at the dock, bow down as it slowly takes on sea water. Its sister ship is in dry dock, its six torpedo tubes pointed inland. Mr. Munk's small marketing team plans to turn the hulk into a museum with a Cold War flavour. Another big sub and a midget sub are being cut up in the yard by bored, sweaty workers in the Montenegrin summer's blast-furnace heat. Two millennia of naval history have come to an inglorious end.
But the vast concrete docks are largely intact. So is a massive crane that will act as a sort of marina beacon. Even though construction has yet to start, it's just possible to get a sense of the future Porto Montenegro. The flat area behind the main docks, right on the water, will be the home of a 150-room Four Seasons hotel and about 250 condo units.
The large swath of property away from the harbour is to become a new city. It will have a conference centre and hotel, a market square where the subs are now being dismantled, an art gallery, a museum, a sports complex and 10,000 square metres of retail space, including a supermarket and a department store. A few kilometres away, near Tivat's airport (which is already jammed with private jets), an 18-hole golf course is to be built. The marina will be in operation in 2010, the Four Seasons a year later.
Local concern
The locals look at the project with a mixture of wonder and fear. Sandra Bijelic, an employee in a Tivat real estate office that is doing booming business with Russian clients, says "It will be good for us to have employment for our people, but Tivat and Kotor must have their soul."
Vesna Macic, 36, a scuba-diving biologist at the University of Montenegro's Institute of Marine Biology, worries that the environmental controls won't be strict enough to prevent oil and chemicals from infiltrating the Bay of Kotor. "If big yachts come here, they have to take on fuel," she says. "The problem is that they could pollute very easily. And do we have to have a golf course? We don't have enough drinking water in this country. Golf courses take a huge amount of water. So do yachts."
Mr. Munk and his team are true believers. They say nothing was worse than the dilapidated Arsenal site, with its seabed covered in pollutants from rusted, leaky ships. All of it will be cleaned up, they insist. The yachties will pump vast loads of money into the economy. Jobs will be created. Plus he's having fun. "I don't play bridge and I'm a lousy skier," he says. "But I have some ability to create and we are creating something wonderful here."

Full text:   Vintages Select
Location: Mississauga
Builder/developer: Di Blasio Homes
Size: 2,472 to 5,458 square feet
Price: $660,000s to $1-million
Sales centre: 6693 Rothschild Trail, near McLaughlin and Derry roads. Open Monday to Wednesday, 1 to 7 p.m.; weekends and holidays, noon to 6 p.m.
Contact: (905) 565-9844 or www.diblasiohomes.com
For the third and final phase of the Vintages community in Mississauga, Di Blasio Homes has introduced new 50-foot lots and models with spacious floor plans and upscale finishes.
With 4,856 to 5,458 square feet of living space, nearly nine-foot ceilings in the basements, 10-foot ceilings on the main floors, these homes will be the "cream of the crop," according to the builder.
"We've kept the best for last," says Alvaro Di Blasio on behalf of the local, family-run company.
"It gives executives an alternative to going down to Lorne Park or southeast Oakville, because this is in the heartland of Mississauga where all the businesses are."
This phase, called Vintages Select, includes 81 stone and stucco homes on lots of 40 and 46 feet in addition to 50 feet. They are on private cul-de-sacs off Rothschild Trail, just west of McLaughlin Road.
Less than 60 per cent of the 100-acre site will be developed for a total of 287 single-family homes. The rest will be left in its natural state, with wooded areas, ravines and wildlife. As a result, lots will be up to 168 feet deep, and several will back on to greenspace.
"They're all walkouts, and in some cases, they have extended walkouts where the basements are 10-feet high," Mr. Di Blasio adds.
To get a taste of the floor plans, there are model homes on site, as well as fully-finished inventory homes that are ready for immediate occupancy.
"It really takes all the guesswork out of buying a home," says Mr. Di Blasio. "[People] get to see what they're buying."
A popular design is the Montenegro - a four-bedroom house on a 40-foot lot. It contains 3,576 square feet with a double garage, main-floor laundry room and a living room with a two-sided gas fireplace shared with a great room. The latter has a double-height cathedral ceiling and oversized windows.
Across the main hall, there is a dining room, and a kitchen with a butler's pantry, walk-in pantry, island and rear walkout, plus tall upper cabinetry and granite countertops.
An oak staircase with wrought-iron spindles leads to the upper landing where there is a computer niche, three full bathrooms and all four bedrooms. The master suite has his and hers walk-in closets and a private bathroom with an oval tub and glass shower stall.
For the first time, the builder is offering optional interior sprinkler systems. "If there were a fire in the bedroom, that sprinkler would turn on and douse the fire [only in that room] as opposed to the whole house being soaked," Mr. Di Blasio adds.

Full text:   Bucolic Prince Edward County has caught the eye of one of Toronto's biggest real estate firms
Real estate agent Laurie Gruer was dreaming of languid weekend escapes when, in one spontaneous moment, he bought a charming yellow Victorian overlooking the harbour in Picton, Ont.
"I saw the yellow house and I just had to buy it. I planned to come down here and never lift a finger."
But Cornelis (Chuck) Slik had other ideas. In 2001, Mr. Slik had spent more than 25 years selling real estate in Prince Edward County when he sold Mr. Gruer the yellow house. After the deal had closed, he knocked on Mr. Gruer's door, dangling a $1.5-million listing.
Why, Mr. Slik suggested, didn't Mr. Gruer pass around some brochures to his clients at Chestnut Park Real Estate Ltd. in Toronto and the two could split the commission?
"One point five million was a big listing down here seven years ago," says Mr. Gruer.
Soon he was on the phone with a prospective buyer in Hoggs Hollow who snatched up the property.
"It was always a great combination," says Mr. Gruer, who spent weekdays in Toronto, making contact with potential buyers in the burgeoning market for vacation homes, while Mr. Slik was on the spot in Prince Edward County, ready to show the houses.
Mr. Slik's family-run brokerage, A Sense of Place Realty, also offered local knowledge that Mr. Gruer couldn't hope to match.
"Real estate down here is a different animal," says Mr. Gruer.
Back in Toronto, Chestnut Park chief executive officer Catherine Deluce couldn't help but see an opportunity in the demographics: Baby boomers want vacation homes that they can enjoy on weekends now and perhaps retire to a few years down the road. Chestnut Park has already moved into the north with offices in Muskoka and Collingwood.
She recently decided to buy A Sense of Place Realty rather than set up a competing office farther down Main Street.
On a recent tour of the county, Ms. Deluce recalled how Mr. Gruer's impulse purchase of the yellow house astonished his colleagues when he bypassed the traditional weekend playgrounds of Muskoka and Georgian Bay for bucolic Prince Edward County.
"It was shocking. Shocking! He returned to the office and said he'd bought a house in Picton. Nobody could believe it," she says. "It was the talk of the office for months. And then of course we all had to come up and see it."
Now she looks at the county's vineyards, restaurants and farms - all surrounded by Lake Ontario - just offshore from Belleville and sees an ideal location for expansion.
"It's food, wine and the arts. It's got it all," says Ms. Deluce, who is also getting to know the best places to stop for fresh produce among the farms along the route in and out of the county.
Mr. Slik and his wife and daughter, Pamela and Lori Slik, all work for Chestnut Park now. Mr. Slik says they agreed to sell to Chestnut Park because the deal should increase business greatly for them with more referrals from Toronto and Muskoka.
They've joined Mr. Gruer and his partner Sam Simone full time at Chestnut Park in an office that has swelled to 12 people.
Ms. Deluce points out that Mr. Slik has more than 100 listings in the county. Driving around the area, she was quick to notice signs that still had the "Sense of Place" logo.
"Chuck still has a few signs that he has to change - it's quite a job," says Ms. Deluce.
But buying an existing business gives Chestnut Park a presence in a market that already has marquee names such as ReMax, Royal Lepage, Prudential, Century 21 and Coldwell Banker competing for listings.
"When you have 100 listings in the county and put Chestnut Park signs on them, it's instant impact."
Mr. Slik, meanwhile, knows the ins and outs of the entire county. "I can show you houses that I've sold four or five times," he says.
He knows contractors, restoration people and local artisans. He knows one of the most desirable locations for a winery is Waupoos, while if you want to grow cash crops, he'll point you to the wards of Hillier, South Marysburgh, Hallowell and Athol. He knows where the shore is weedy and where it offers great swimming. He's knowledgeable about the local building codes and septic systems.
He keeps a soil map and water-depth charts in his office in an eight-bedroom Victorian brick house on Picton's Main Street.
Plenty of times clients have phoned saying they want a waterfront location where their kids can swim, he says. Mr. Slik points out that, on about 70 per cent of properties listed, that would not be possible. The county has high bluffs in many areas.
"There's such a variance in the shoreline."
Mr. Slik points out that Chestnut Park caters to high-end clientele in Toronto, just as A Sense of Place does in the county.
Ms. Deluce appears less comfortable with the notion of carving out a niche. "We'll be able to show people properties in all price ranges," she says.
Still, Mr. Gruer recently set a new high-water mark in the county when he sold a house for $2.7-million. That was $300,000 over the asking price of $2.4-million, which fell by the wayside when two prospective buyers competed for the old farmhouse set on 158 acres of land with a mile of shoreline overlooking Soup Harbour.
That kind of Toronto-style bidding war is rare in the county but the area has had a remarkable run in recent years.
"Thirty-five years ago it was very slow here," says Mr. Slik. "Things have changed drastically."
Over the years, people from the city began buying tumble-down farmhouses and restoring them for weekend retreats.
More recently, former Toronto chef Michael Potters put down roots with his celebrated restaurant, Harvest, while Michael Stevenson has moved his batterie de cuisine from The Fifth to the Merrill Inn. And Toronto chef Jamie Kennedy is farming in the county.
"He's closer and closer to moving here," says Mr. Gruer.
Still, Ms. Deluce acknowledges that the torrid pace of recent years is unlikely to continue. The market in Toronto and elsewhere may be "less frothy" but she sees no reason to rein in the expansion.
"Generally speaking, prices don't have a lot higher to go. I don't think you're going to see a run-up," she says. "Even if it's not as hot, it's still a strong market."
She's relying on baby boomers who want vacation homes now. Perhaps they'll move into the city condominiums in years to come.
In downtown Picton, for example, a new development put 17 units on the block three weeks ago; 11 had sold as of last week.
Mr. Gruer receives regular calls from potential buyers in Toronto and most of them go like this: "We want a century house on the water in the county. Preferably stone."
If only he had about 300 more of those, he says wistfully.
At the moment, he is showing 17 West St. in Wellington, with 158 feet of open lakefront. It's not built of stone, but it is a century home that has been expanded and renovated to take advantage of the views over the water.
"It will be a sophisticated Toronto couple who will buy this spectacular waterfront location," says Mr. Gruer. "People want 'all done' when they move down here. They don't want to have to renovate."
For people who can't live without stone, Mr. Gruer has the Roblin Chant house. The Regency cottage listed for $1.25-million has 12 acres of land, water access across the road, and a carriage house.
Mr. Gruer says some of the nicest houses in the county are those that were built by wealthy merchants in the towns. Many potential buyers are wandering along the side streets of Picton and Wellington.
"It's not all about the country dream or the waterfront - it's about having a real life in town," he says. "Being able to walk to get a cappuccino.
Besides, on the peninsula that feels like an island, water is all around.
"Usually after they look around a bit, they realize the waterfront is only 12 minutes away in any direction."

Full text:   Loft condo in a converted church has 26-foot ceilings and exposed roof trusses
12 Macpherson Ave., No. 3
What: a three-storey townhouse that is one of five units in a former church in the Summerhill area.
Living space: 2,600 square feet
Asking price: $1,995,000
Taxes: $9,169 (2008)
Agent: Susan Bandler, Chestnut Park Real Estate Ltd.
In the heart of the Summerhill community, this century-old, former Baptist church on Macpherson Avenue is revered by the handful of residents who live there.
"[The developer] took a large church and only made five units ... as opposed to trying to cram in as many one-level condos as possible," agent Susan Bandler says of the converted structure near Avenue and Davenport roads. "It gets a ton of interest because it's so unique."
The last time a unit there came up for sale was about 2½ years ago, and it happened to be this three-storey condominium, according to the agent.
"The only reason [the owners are] moving out is because they want to be closer to their daughter, who is having their first grandchild," she explains.
Ms. Bandler believes this building is one of the most coveted church conversions in the city, saying it's quite unlike anything else she's seen. She cites its spacious suite sizes, multiple levels of living space, and unique floor plans that preserve the brick building's grand architectural features.
"[The conversion] maintained the integrity of the original church, and used only the finest of materials," which is not typical for newly built projects," she explains.
It's believed that the congregation of the Century Baptist Church began meeting in members' homes on nearby Birch Street in 1888. The group was formally organized in 1901 and decided to build a church that could accommodate 500, and a basement that could hold 400 Sunday school attendees.
The structure was built in the early 1900s, and was expanded and renovated over the years until the parishioners left in 1970. It was sold a decade after that to a group practising theosophy.
After a devastating fire in 1986, the building was sold to a developer, who renovated and restored it to its present state. The structure was ideal for a condo: The walls between units are solid concrete and completely sound proof.
This unit features arched windows and 26-foot vaulted ceilings with exposed roof trusses on the top floor.
"It's very, very special," Ms. Bandler says. "You go in and your jaw drops."
Similar to other suites, it has a three-level plan measuring about 2,600 square feet. Windows face east and west and residents have direct access to the street and garage.
"It's perfect for people downsizing, for example, from Rosedale or Forest Hill," Ms. Bandler states. "It still feels like a home, yet you're in a smaller, more unique space in an amazing location."
Unlike most conventional homes, however, the third level was dedicated to an office and media/family room rather than sleeping quarters.
"This was the most logical place for a media room because it has a big stone fireplace and there is no bathroom," Ms. Bandler says.
"With the ceilings being so high, I don't think that's conducive for a bedroom."
The owners prior to the present one hired local design firm Powell and Bonnell to remodel the interiors. Several projects were carried out between 2000 and 2005, one of which was updating the third floor.
Improvements made in the family room included a new fireplace surround, cabinetry, lighting and herringbone-patterned oak hardwood flooring.
An artist hand-painted the walls so that they get gradually darker as they approach the ceiling, an effect meant to de-emphasize the unit's narrow and vertical dimensions and create a more intimate atmosphere, the agent says. It took nearly a month to create the effect, which mimics an old European building lit by candles and its fireplace.
On the main floor, the designers remodelled the kitchen around existing appliances; created special wall panelling, cornice mouldings and lighting fixtures for the foyer, living and dining rooms; added a storage unit beneath the circular staircase; and spruced up the powder room.
Recently, the present owner put up glass mosaic backsplashes in the kitchen; installed new shower heads in the second-floor bathrooms and installed an auxiliary air conditioner for the third floor.
Interior designer Linda Schwartz was brought in to, among other things, select furniture and paint colours.
For entertaining outdoors, there is a private space with an interlocking patio, a gas hookup, new landscape lighting in the rock garden and antique brass and glass terrace dividers.
Gargoyles and water fountains provide interesting focal points, and wild pear trees and boxwoods in planters soften the edges.
The grounds surrounding the building are well maintained, complete with heated walkways and driveways and lush greenery, Ms. Bandler says.
The condo board has replaced the roof and put about $350,000 into landscaping," she adds, noting that the work on the grounds was done by Janet Rosenberg and Associates.
"The second you step off the sidewalk of MacPherson, you can tell it's a unique, high-end and very well-cared-for condo."
The amenities
This townhouse has two bedrooms, three bathrooms, living and dining rooms and an upper-level office and family room.
The main floor - with 10-foot ceilings - features a dining room with built-in cabinetry, an oval staircase and a living room with a gas fireplace and two sets of French doors. They open to a 180-square-foot terrace.
Oak hardwood flooring in the living and dining rooms gives way to marble floors in the kitchen. The latter includes granite countertops, a glass-mosaic backsplash, breakfast bar, wine fridge and upscale appliances. A powder room completes the level.
Upstairs, the master suite has a wall-to-wall closet, glass-block windows and a private bathroom with a whirlpool tub. The second bedroom and three-piece bathroom are also on this level.
A third-floor media/family room has a wood-burning fireplace and 26-foot cathedral ceiling. It is pre-wired for a home theatre system. French doors open to an office with heated limestone floors, a vaulted ceiling, built-in bookcases and heat-blocking windows.
A laundry room is located on the lower level, which provides access to a garage with two parking spots and a locker.
The large third floor requires its own furnace, air-conditioning unit, air cleaner and humidifier, so there are two of each system in the home. The top floor also has an auxiliary AC system.
A monthly fee of $1,830 includes water and heating.

Full text:   Businesswoman Caron Czorny got so involved in the community where her second home was that she ran for office - and won
Want to get elected to municipal office in the Laurentians? For one thing, you'll have to sail dock to dock campaigning, which has its benefits in the stunningly beautiful, lake-studded area north of Montreal.
Caron Czorny knows all about it. In 2005, she took on two opponents and won a four-year term on the District 5 council in the municipality of Wentworth-North.
But Ms. Czorny, 56, is only a part-time resident of the district. She and her soon-to-be husband, Michael Pepper, own a cottage on Lake Francis Xavier near Montfort; their main home is in Oakville, Ont., although she works in Montreal.
The gregarious and bilingual businesswoman got involved in cottage country government at the urging of some local people. Her fiancé adds that she "feels giving back and doing community work is very important."
She seems to take her council work in stride. Wherever she is, she uses the typical communication tools - her Blackberry, cellphone and the Internet. When she is at the cottage - which, she says, is about 10 per cent of the time - it obviously cuts into her relaxation time there.
But, as Mr. Pepper explains, "Caron is a people-person and she got to know a lot of people and she knew the issues, too."
Ms. Czorny, executive vice-president and chief operating officer of PEAK Insurance Services Inc., and Mr. Pepper, 63, president and chief executive of the Travel Industry Council of Ontario, bought the cottage after a March ski holiday in 2002.
They first saw the place while they were renting another cottage in the district. Coming upon it while snowshoeing near the lake, it was almost hidden by drifts of snow. Using an emergency phone number posted in a window, they managed to contact the owners, and by Easter a deal was struck.
The place is about 1,500 square feet, with three bedrooms and two bathrooms, Mr. Pepper explains.
"It's a frame construction with aluminum siding, and had been rebuilt around the original cottage. We turned the lower level into a bedroom and bathroom."
Heat is generated by a wood-burning stove and some baseboard heaters. "It can be 30-below outside and the stove will give off enough heat that we have to open the windows," Mr. Pepper says.
During their first season as cottagers, the couple were greeted and feted. They formed friendships that were strengthened through reciprocal acts of support.
"When our neighbours' cottage burnt down, we loaned them our truck tent and they lived in it that summer," Mr. Pepper recalls.
"Then, when my boat sank, they let me know, and helped me arrange to have it towed and repaired."
A controversy over sediment seeping into Lake Francis Xavier from another lake (the issue is before the courts) prompted some local residents to approach Ms. Czorny and ask her to run for council, which is typically split about 50-50 between full-time residents and part-time cottagers.
With their jobs and the cottage, the couple clearly travels a lot. While he works in the Oakville area, she goes to Montreal on Mondays and stays the week. On weekends and in summer, they often go to the cottage.
Ms. Czorny estimates that she spends about 15 hours a month on her council responsibilities. There are monthly meetings, which run from 7 to 10 p.m., but those days start at 4 when the caucus meets. "There's prep time and then the driving ... to get there," she adds.
There are plenty of issues dealt with - from illegal docks to garbage collection to providing services such as fire trucks, which are mandated by the provincial government.
"How to fund services is always a huge question," Ms. Czorny explains. "You can only tax people so much. There are a lot of retirees who own property there and that has to be taken into account."
Her constituents don't hesitate to call when, say, their road hasn't been plowed. "There are a lot of phone calls," Mr. Pepper says, adding that some area residents don't "really appreciate the amount of work she puts into her role as councillor."
Wentworth-Nord Mayor Andre Genest says Ms. Czorny's contribution "is very much appreciated. She works by conference call and other ways, since she is often far away. Our area is 155 square kilometres with 105 lakes and ... only 2,000 houses.
"People who come here and build are very concerned about the quality of the water and other elements," the mayor notes. "They have a big investment and they are willing to pay for it. Sometimes we have big debates.
"Property owners who have lived here all their lives would like to see a bit more development," he says. "Newer people would like to be the last ones to come here and build."
Ms. Czorny and Mr. Pepper obviously love the area. They often run together on an old CN railway line - renamed the Aerobic Trail - adapted for use as running and biking track, and in the winter, they snowshoe and cross-country ski.
In Montfort, there is a community centre - a one-time church that is used for local functions. One scheduled for this summer is the wedding of Ms. Czorny and Mr. Pepper.
"We will have about 90 guests," she says. "During the ceremony, the pews will face one way, and after that we will all go outside where, during the cocktail hour, we will be entertained by a fellow from La Chute who plays the fiddle. Then we will go back inside where everything will be rearranged for a dinner."
While they recently purchased a three-bedroom condo suite in Naples Fla. - which may become their alternate getaway in retirement - they are still struck by the natural beauty of their Quebec retreat.
"We have a wonderful view across the lake," Ms. Czorny says. "We can sit at our place and watch the moon across the water as it rises above the Laurentians."

Say goodbye to 'us' and 'them'

Abstract: The division got a little murky when it came to Blake Cassels & Graydon and McCarthy Tetrault, which had been in the Calgary market since the late 1980s; they were kind of "us," forced to wear some foreign T-shirts designed by "them." And the indigenous law firms that merged into national firms - such as the predecessor Calgary firms of Borden Ladner Gervais, Fraser Milner Casgrain and Gowling LaFleur Henderson - were still "us," but there was a suspicion, sometimes just,...

Tristram Mallett can pinpoint the moment when he realized there was no longer a difference between "us" and "them."
The managing partner of Osler Hoskin & Harcourt's Calgary office came from Toronto more than a decade ago, as part of Osler's first storming of the Calgary legal citadel, which was dominated by local independent firms that were not interested in mergers with Eastern Canadian law firms.
In those days, Mr. Mallett was perceived as an outsider, notwithstanding seasons tickets to the Calgary Flames, Stampeders and various local theatres.
That's over. The change came gradually, of course, but there was an epiphany. A few months ago, a client called, demanding a meeting immediately. Mr. Mallett was at the client's offices in 15 minutes. Osler - the Bayest of the Bay Street law firms - was sharing a mandate with a local Calgary law firm, which was staffing the account with people in its Toronto office.
"So there I was, in the boardroom, and the incumbent firm had three lawyers on the phone from Toronto," Mr. Mallett recalls. "The Eastern carpetbagger was the guy who was able to walk across the street and be there in 15 minutes, and the incumbent firm was dialling in guys from the 416 area code."
It's getting harder to find a difference now between the "us" and the "them" from back East. What's more, if you can tell them apart, it's hard to find anyone who cares.
When Mr. Mallett came to Calgary, he was one of "them." Even three years ago, the Calgary legal market was firmly divided into the indigenous Calgary law firms ("us") and the outposts of eastern law firms ("them").
Bennett Jones, Macleod Dixon, and Burnet Duckworth & Palmer were the vanguard of the full-blooded "us." The Calgary offices of Osler and Stikeman Elliott were undoubtedly "them" - never mind that both were chock full of Calgary lawyers.
The division got a little murky when it came to Blake Cassels & Graydon and McCarthy Tetrault, which had been in the Calgary market since the late 1980s; they were kind of "us," forced to wear some foreign T-shirts designed by "them." And the indigenous law firms that merged into national firms - such as the predecessor Calgary firms of Borden Ladner Gervais, Fraser Milner Casgrain and Gowling LaFleur Henderson - were still "us," but there was a suspicion, sometimes just, sometimes not, that they were really ruled by "them," with the shots being called in Toronto.
"The time of that distinction has passed," says Lou Cusano, managing partner of Stikeman in Calgary.
Theoretically, in Calgary, it doesn't matter where you come from, so long as you can do the job. There's a catch, though. As Robert Engbloom notes, you've also got to have the right local relationships.
Mr. Engbloom is one of Calgary's most respected senior corporate lawyers, and an "us" lawyer all the way - he started his career with Calgary's MacKimmie Matthews and joined Macleod Dixon in 1999 when MacKimmie dissolved.
"Whether you are a Calgary law firm or a Toronto law firm with a Calgary office, you have to have local relationships," he says. "Most clients will be looking at you for your own capability, your services, and your relationships."
The Toronto-based outfits have that now. "The line [between "us" and "them"] has blurred as Toronto firms have acquired Calgary firms, Calgary lawyers and Calgary relationships," Mr. Engbloom sums up.
Here's the strange thing about all this: There is not an iota of defensiveness in Mr. Engbloom's analysis. Ditto when Perry Spitznagel, Bennett Jones' Calgary managing partner and vice-chairman of the firm, speaks about Toronto firms - even the Bennett Jones-partner-poaching Osler.
And he won't play the "we're local, we're better" card. After all, since 2000 Bennett Jones has been storming the Toronto fortress, and its 150 Toronto lawyers are - size-wise, revenue-wise and reputation-wise - chasing the benchmark established by their 170 Calgary colleagues.
A decade ago, the Calgary legal community had a pronounced defensiveness in relation to Bay Street and its more established, "almost like New York" institutions. Calgary law firms were quick to point out that their people were "just as good, or maybe even better" than the lawyers in Toronto. The deals in Calgary were "just as complicated" as the stuff done on Bay Street. And, by the way, the billing rates were lower.
Today, Calgary is bursting with self-confidence, and its lawyers aren't measuring themselves against some mythical Bay Street benchmark. (The billing rates are still a little lower, but that's likely to change as soon as local law firms have to renegotiate their real estate leases.)
"We don't think about Toronto any more ... we don't talk about Toronto any more," says Richard Clark, a corporate partner with the Calgary office of Gowlings. For the firms that bought into the national law firm model, the national platform has never been about getting "national" work. It's been about getting more credibility when dealing with "New York, Dallas, Houston, Hong Kong," Mr. Clark says.
That credibility exists. Calgary knows it's one of the hubs of the world's energy industry, says John Brussa, a tax partner with Burnet Duckworth & Palmer.
"It's a feeling of we're all grown-up now," agrees Peter Feldberg, a partner with the Calgary and Vancouver offices of Fasken Martineau DuMoulin.

Full text: With his brother, he ran the family firm. 'Walter was the financial man in the company and Ted was the advertising and promotional guy. They got along very well, so it worked out'
Walter Tilden might have succeeded in the military, professional sports or business. Born in the generation that was reared in the Depression and came of age too late to fight in the Second World War, he was a successful businessman and dedicated volunteer in the expansionist postwar boom in tourism, travel and the car-rental business.
His story, which is ineluctably intertwined with the saga of the feisty, nationalist Tilden Rent-a-Car Co., is a tale of hard work, canny salesmanship and bad luck. Both their fortunes began with a scrappy American immigrant named Sam Tilden, who parlayed a Hertz franchise in Montreal into a lucrative rental and leasing operation with outlets across the country and affiliates around the world. The end came after a fiery New York crash involving a Tilden rental car brought a threat of massive litigation. The company was later sold to National Car Rental in the United States.
Walter Benedict Tilden, the third of four sons of Samuel (Sam) and Sylvia (nee Dorken) Tilden was born in Montreal the year before the Crash. Three years earlier, Sam Tilden, a shoe salesman, had bought the Hertz franchise for Montreal after answering an ad in the Saturday Evening Post. He went into the car-rental business with three Chryslers and a loan from his father.
Walter's older brothers Sam and Robert (Rob) called him "Squealer" when he was a small child, because he could be guaranteed to complain to their parents when they set upon him. "The more we teased him, the more he would fight back. Ultimately, of course, he became a determined, formidable competitor both in business and the sports world," Robert Tilden said in a eulogy at his younger brother's funeral. "Walter was the most all-rounded guy I have ever known," he added in an interview. "He did a tremendous amount of social work and won all kinds of awards for it."
Walter's father was a scrapper and an canny entrepreneur. Hertz wrenched its franchise back, thinking it could squeeze more money out of the car-rental business in Montreal itself, so Mr. Tilden went into the miniature-golf business in 1929, then sold off his golf properties before the Depression crippled the economy. By 1932, Mr. Tilden had his franchise back, several valuable pieces of property and a comfortable house in Westmount atop Mount Royal. His sons went to Roslyn School and then Westmount High School.
Like his father, Walter was a natural athlete. An avid skier and sailor, he wanted to follow his brother Rob into the navy during the Second World War. He applied to Royal Roads Military College in Victoria and won a sea-cadet scholarship, but by the time he arrived, in September, 1945, the war was over. Near the end of his first academic year, he was diagnosed with glandular tuberculosis and prescribed the "rest cure," a common treatment at the time. After resting all summer, he was not deemed well enough to return to Royal Roads. Instead, he enrolled at McGill University in Montreal, where he was forbidden to engage in any sports or extracurricular activities. He returned to Victoria in September, 1947, and although disappointed to be a year behind his original classmates at Royal Roads, he distinguished himself in sailing and golf and was named cadet captain of Rodney Division. He remained an active alumnus for the rest of his life; Royal Roads awarded him an honorary degree in 1993, the same year that he and brother Ted were inducted into the Canadian Business Hall of Fame.
After Royal Roads, he went back to McGill, which gave him two years of academic credit. He won letters in golf, rugby, skiing, squash and water polo, graduating with a bachelor of commerce degree in 1950. He had plenty of job offers, but turned them all down to work for his father in the car-rental business.
At the time, Tilden had three outlets - Montreal, Hamilton and Ottawa - with Walter heading up the Ottawa franchise. Sixteen months later, on Sept. 22, 1951, he married Jane Brenchley, a McGill graduate (1951) and the sister of one of his classmates at Royal Roads. By then, the Ottawa franchise boasted a fleet of eight cars. Mrs. Tilden can still remember pushing her son, Bruce, in a baby carriage up to the gas station at Somerset and Bronson, where the Tilden franchise was located, to look at the first truck they bought. "It really was a grassroots operation," she said. "And it grew and grew."
The 1950s was an expansionist time in business travel and car rentals, and being independent of car manufacturers gave Tilden a competitive edge. In 1952, Paul Edward (Ted), the youngest of Sam Tilden's sons, joined the company and moved to Victoria with his wife, Pixie, to run the newly acquired Tilden franchise there. A year later, Sam Tilden and several other Hertz franchise owners, who were fed up with the American company's onerous cancellation policy (which allowed Hertz to take back a franchise without cause on 60 days notice) and its insistence that advertising copy written south of the border applied equally well in Canada, formed The Tilden Rent-a-Car System. Within a year, they had more than 100 locations in Canada, although not in Toronto, which remained with Hertz. A decade later, with Canadians and Americans heading abroad in droves, Mr. Tilden made a deal with National Car Rentals, out of Minneapolis, to establish a 50/50 network of independently owned outlets in Europe called Europcar. Later, Mr. Tilden made the same kind of deal with Nippon Rent-A-Car in Asia.
By the mid 1960s, the family-owned Tilden Corp., had three main companies: Tilden Rent-a-Car Co., of which Walter was president; Tilden-Rent-a Car Ltd., of which Ted was president; and Tilden Drive Yourself (Hamilton) Ltd. Sam, the patriarch, was chairman. All of these companies, and their approximately 2,000 vehicles, were part of The Tilden Rent-a-Car System, which also included about 2,500 cars belonging to independent franchise operators in various spots across the country. The system had about 200 outlets in Canada - the most airport and downtown locations of any car-rental operation in Canada - and affiliates in 35 other countries. They spent close to $10-million a year buying new cars for the rental fleets and grossed about $10-million in revenues in Canada alone.
Sam Tilden died of a heart attack in June, 1973. He was 76. Walter succeeded his father as chairman. The next year, Walter and Ted Tilden bought the elusive Toronto franchise from Hertz and moved head office from Montreal to Toronto - a headquarters shift they almost certainly would not have made while their father was alive. Walter and his family moved to Toronto from Ottawa while Ted and his family stayed in Montreal.
"Walter was the financial man in the company and Ted was the advertising and promotional guy. They got along very well, so it worked out," said their surviving brother, Rob. Although he was supposed to be the communications guru for the company, Ted Tilden could be flamboyant and outspoken. It was a volatile combination - especially in Quebec, where politics had heated up in the aftermath of the formation of the Parti Quebecois in 1968, the October crisis in 1970 and the election of the PQ in 1976.
Ted Tilden expressed publicly a frustration that many anglophone businessmen felt privately when he criticized Quebec's French-only language policy in a speech to the Montreal Chamber of Commerce in February, 1982, calling Bill 101 "darn fool language legislation" and "crock of lard," while accusing a "nationalist elite" of "committing suicide - theirs and ours." In retaliation, the province's largest teacher's union terminated its contract with Tilden, and Treasury Board president Yves Berubé said that Quebec civil servants would in future have to show "good reason" for renting Tilden cars.
The 1990s were both troubling and celebratory times for Walter Tilden. On the positive side, he was heavily involved in volunteer work with Scouts Canada, fishing and hunting, and collecting Canadian art - especially works by the Group of Seven. Then Ted Tilden died at the Royal Victoria Hospital after suffering a heart attack on the squash court at the Montreal Athletic Association on March 6, 1991. He was 60 and had owned 50 per cent of the operation.
There was a second disaster in the offing. Two months after Ted Tilden's death, a Toronto couple and two friends from Mississauga were burned to death when the Tilden car they had rented in Canada was hit by a gasoline tanker shortly after midnight at an intersection in the Bronx area of New York. The tanker rolled on top of the car, spilled half its 4,000 gallons of gasoline and exploded. The fireball killed the driver, engulfed a row of nearly a dozen stores, including a pet store, and set off a series of explosions in parked cars. More than 200 firefighters worked for three hours to bring the blaze under control. A spokesman for Island Transportation Corp., the owner of the fuel truck, claimed the traffic lights weren't working properly when its driver hit the Tilden car broadside.
Meanwhile, the deep recession of the early 1990s and bitter competition in the car-rental markets were hurting the company's bottom line. In March, 1992, the company took on a new name, Tilden InterRent, to play up its global connections by sharing customer information, branding and travel-rewards programs with a network of international partners at 4,000 locations and 1,1000 airports in 124 countries.
Ominously, the nearly two dozen claims, including suits for wrongful death, that had come out of the 1991 traffic accident were wending their way through the U.S. legal system at a time when juries were awarding vast amounts of money in personal-injury lawsuits. The truck company did not have enough insurance to cover the potentially colossal costs and a local law allowed plaintiffs to seek redress from Tilden.
In June, 1995, Mr. Tilden, by then 67, entered into serious negotiations to sell the company for "estate planning reasons." He stipulated that he wouldn't sell to a competitor. "We are trying to protect everybody's jobs," although not necessarily his own, he told The Globe and Mail. He was willing to stay on to ensure an orderly transition. "If they want me, I'm there to help," he said.
A month later, Newcourt Credit Group Inc. bought Tilden's leasing operations. Tilden's long-time American associate, National Car Rental, was an obvious purchaser for the rest of the company. It had no outlets in Canada, but was Tilden's international partner in InterRent. The talks stalled in February, 1996, (about the time that Walter Tilden retired and was succeeded by his niece Patricia Tilden as president and chief executive officer of the family company) when the 17 lawsuits from the 1991 accident were consolidated, causing Tilden's bankers to become twitchy. Tilden tried to cap its potential liability by seeking protection under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement from the Ontario Court of Justice late in April, 1996, about a month before the lawsuits were expected to go to trial.
"The Bronx litigation and the recent experience of the Loewen Group Inc. at the hands of an American jury [a tiny American competitor sued the Canadian funeral-home operator and was awarded $500-million (U.S.) in November, 1995] have made potential investors extremely leery of investing in Tilden, until the amount of the damages - if any - the company faces, can be quantified," Patricia Tilden said in an affidavit.
Early in June, 1996, a U.S. judge ruled that Tilden could be liable for part of any awards made by a jury, although Walter Tilden's son, Bruce, says the claims were eventually tossed out of court. Within a week, National had paid $115-million for Tilden's fleet of vehicles. It accepted 95 per cent of Tilden's employees and agreed to operate in Canada under the name National Tilden. Tilden retained its $4-million worth of real-estate assets. "In hindsight, our timing couldn't have been better because of 9/11 and the economy and everything that has happened since," Patricia Tilden said in an interview.
By then, Mr. Tilden had been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. He refused to let it slow him down, and carried on dealing with the Tilden real-estate interests, his volunteer work with Scouts, his passion for collecting Canadian landscape art and helping two friends set up and promote a fishing lodge in the Queen Charlotte Islands. In his last five years, he surmounted heart disease and prostate cancer, only to be diagnosed in late spring with liver cancer.
Late in June, a delegation of Scouts came to Mr. Tilden's house to make a special presentation honouring him with his 45-year service pin. At his funeral, Mrs. Tilden said, "there was a whole row of scouts wearing their blazers and ties," including a nephew who had run a huge Scout jamboree in Quebec last year. He turned up in his scout uniform and said "he had been inspired by Walter."
WALTER TILDEN
Walter Tilden, C.M., was born May 23, 1928, in Montreal. He died July 9, 2008, in Toronto. He was 80. Predeceased by his infant son, Andrew, and brothers Sam and Ted, he is survived by his wife Jane, six children, four grandchildren, brother Robert, many nieces and nephews and his extended family.

Full text: THE STORRIER
15 Springfield Ave., Sydney;
61 (0) 2 8988 6999; www.thestorrier.com
ROOMS AND RATES
Seventy rooms from $195 for a superior room (one double bed); the executive twin suite (with kitchenette) is $780.
Sure, you can follow the guidebooks and go gallery-hopping around Sydney's Potts Point. Or you can take things up a notch and check in for a stay at the The Storrier, which calls itself Australia's first "art hotel." This sleek hotel-cum-gallery takes its cues from the work of Tim Storrier, a Sydney-born, internationally renowned artist known for quirky images of the Australian landscape.
Every element of the hotel is based on Storrier's work. Original works adorn the public areas and some guest rooms. Even the hotel's colour palette - neutral with burnt-orange highlights - draws on Point to Point (Evening Blaze) , the artist's painting of a giant burning rope across a night sky. And if guests just can't get enough of Storrier, they can purchase a pair of flip-flops emblazoned with the burning rope image.
The brainchild of wealthy Australian art collector Will Deague, The Storrier is the first of seven art hotels scheduled to open in Sydney and Melbourne over the next three years.
LOCATION Depending on which way you head when you walk out its door, The Storrier sits in one of the most sophisticated areas of Sydney or one of the shabbiest. It's located at the south end of Potts Point. Just a few streets north, you'll find mind-blowing sushi, eclectic galleries, avant-garde theatre, boutiques and some of the city's most expensive real estate. Walk south and seedy strip joints abound. But it's central; The Storrier lies less than three kilometres from Sydney's opera house, Royal Botanic Gardens and the Rocks, the city's oldest neighbourhood.
DESIGN The Storrier draws inspiration from two sources: the building's art deco heritage and Point to Point (Evening Blaze) , the painting that dominates the lobby. The hotel has a vaguely old-Hollywood feel with contemporary paintings and black-and-white photos on beige walls. High marks for the finishing touches: black-and-white striped parlour chairs in the bedrooms, a swan-shaped spout in a bathroom and an ornate Moooi chandelier made of paper in the dining room.
CLIENTELE If our eavesdropping is any indication, many guests are repeat visitors. They tend to be stylish Australians, generally couples or business types in their 30s and 40s who appreciate art and red wine.
AMBIENCE Coolly artsy; guests are happy to sit for hours with a latte and the morning newspaper. Don't expect maids in uniforms to bring you bedtime chocolates.
ROOMS Because of the building's curious proportions (it's a three-sided structure with a curved front), no two rooms are alike. Each room has luxurious queen-size beds topped with a black faux-fur blanket and high-end linens, plasma television screens and iPod docking stations. Many have a fully equipped kitchenette, original Storrier works and access to a rooftop terrace. The bathrooms, however, are very small, with no bathtub or space to place a toiletry bag by the sink. On the flip side, they have marble surfaces and come with sweet-smelling Molton Brown products.
SERVICE Friendly and efficient. All our requests were carried out by exquisitely attractive staff. When we decided to extend our reservation at the last minute, the front desk worked a bit of magic so we didn't have to change rooms. Gym and spa services are not available onsite, but are nearby.
FOOD AND DRINK The neighbourhood suffers no shortage of bars or restaurants. But it's difficult to walk past without nipping into the hotel's Red Belly restaurant, with its marble bar and flamingo motif wallpaper. The restaurant offers extensive à la carte and "grazing" menus for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Dinner service includes Aussie-isms such as "cockles and chorizo" and oven-baked coconut with sea scallops. Twenty-four-hour room service is available.
Warning: Beware the $90 bottle of wine in the room. We didn't receive a mini-bar menu in our room and very nearly popped the cork. Turns out wines aren't affordable quite everywhere in Australia.
THINGS TO DO Sit on the rooftop terrace and watch the sun set behind the Opera House. Check out the 10,000 plant species in the nearby Royal Botanic Gardens. Scope out the nearby Ferrari, Lamborghini and Maserati dealerships. Or you could browse boutiques, bookstores and galleries in Potts Point.
Don't miss Martin Browne Fine art, a popular gallery that showcases Australian and international modern artists (57-59 Macleay St., www.martinbrownefineart.com). Wander next door into the Yellow Bistro & Food Store, a tiny restaurant and grocery that is a favourite of local foodies.
BOTTOM LINE: Original and comfortable space at very good rates for central Sydney.

Abstract: After finishing high school, Mr. [Bernard Jesse] went to Sudbury, where [Reynold] was working in a mine.

Full text: Poorly trained and ill equipped, he was among Canadian soldiers sent to protect the British colony. Later, he returned home and prospered, but remained forever haunted by his wartime experiences
A meteorologist, businessman, politician and writer, Bernard Jesse was a pillar of his community in Estevan, Sask. Despite his successes, Mr. Jesse was haunted by a dark past, having been a prisoner of war in Japan, where he was beaten regularly and forced to do slave labour in a coal mine.
The son of a Michigan couple who had settled in Western Canada under the Dominion Lands Act that promoted settlement, he grew up on the family farm near Wordsworth, Sask., a small village about 200 kilometres southeast of Regina. The third of seven children, he was a competitive lad who enrolled at the local one-room schoolhouse a year earlier than usual. He had insisted on an early start to his education because he didn't want to be outdone by his sister Violet, who was a year older.
When the Depression hit, the Jesses weren't affected as much as other farm families on the Prairies. While his father worked as a foreman for the railroad, Bernard and his older brother, Reynold, would ride the rails to Manitoba in the summer, picking up work as farmhands where they could. The boys would earn a few cents for a 14-hour day of hard manual labour and used the money to buy new school clothes in the fall, dickering with shopkeepers to get a good price.
After finishing high school, Mr. Jesse went to Sudbury, where Reynold was working in a mine. Once there, Mr. Jesse decided mining wasn't for him and decided to enlist in the Royal Canadian Air Force. Even though the Second World War had started, the air force wasn't recruiting, so Mr. Jesse signed up with the Winnipeg Grenadiers, a woefully equipped infantry regiment that was still using old uniforms and rifles from the First World War. His training was minimal - he learned how to march and assemble and disassemble weapons, but there were no bullets for shooting practice. But his pay was 75 cents a day, a lot more than he could make farming.
In early 1940, the regiment was sent to Jamaica to perform garrison duty and guard German prisoners of war. Mr. Jesse worked as a motorcycle scout, keeping a watch on islanders who were thought to be sympathetic to the enemy.
By September, 1941, the unit was back in Winnipeg - but not for long. To discourage sabre-rattling by the Japanese, Britain figured it should send soldiers to protect Hong Kong. Since British troops were at a premium, Canada was asked to contribute, and in October, the Grenadiers and the Royal Rifles from Quebec set sail for the colony. Neither regiment had much experience, but few were overly concerned, since Japan was not yet at war. Following a zigzag pattern to avoid targeting by German submarines, their ship took 33 days to reach Hong Kong. On Nov. 16, they marched ashore to the beat of a military band.
Three weeks later, the Japanese struck - just hours after the attack on Pearl Harbor. The Canadians were entirely unprepared. Outnumbered and outgunned - their artillery and machine guns had been mistakenly sent to Manila - they fought bravely with little more than rifles, grenades and side arms.
Mr. Jesse was stringing up a telephone wire when he saw the Japanese planes overhead. Over the next several days, he was involved in a number of minor skirmishes, but did not appreciate the severity of the situation until the pill boxes the men were holed up in were hit by mortar fire. Out of 14 men in his unit, only Mr. Jesse and three others survived.
The four men were then sent to guard a bridge, where they encountered a truck with loudspeakers that announced the fighting was over. Skeptical, Mr. Jesse and the others held their position and later retreated to headquarters. It was there, on Christmas Day, that they were told they were prisoners of war. Their fighting days were over. For others in Hong Kong, the situation only became worse. In what became known as "Black Christmas," Japanese soldiers went on a rampage of looting, attacking hospitals and schools and terrorizing civilians. Hundreds of men were murdered at random and an estimated 10,000 women were raped.
After packing up as much food and clothing as they could carry, Mr. Jesse and his comrades were marched to an old building where living conditions proved to be poor. An outbreak of diphtheria hit the camp, throwing Mr. Jesse into a state of delirium. The illness eventually caused him to lose his sight.
Nursed back to health by fellow prisoners, his vision returned and he was sent to Japan to work in a Tokyo shipyard, cutting steel. That came to an end when the site was attacked by U.S. bombers. Everyone ran to the safety of bomb shelters except Mr. Jesse. The diphtheria had left his legs permanently crippled and he could move no faster than walking pace.
After the shipyard, the men were sent to work in a remote coal mine where conditions were primitive and dangerous. They were expected to continually dig while standing in hot water and sulphur. Month after month they were beaten, starved and denied contact with the International Red Cross. The only reason Mr. Jesse's parents knew he was alive was because the Red Cross had earlier been allowed to record greetings from him and some of the other soldiers. The recording made it to Canada and onto the radio waves, which gave them hope that they might see him again.
In the mines, little changed from day to day, and the PoWs were beginning to give up when they woke up one morning to discover that all the guards had disappeared. Some of the prisoners ran into the bushes to see if they would draw any fire, but nothing happened. Thin, hungry and underweight, they stole chickens and eggs from a farm and figured out what to do next.
The question was answered when an American plane dropped food and supplies. It seemed the war was over.
They found a road, which led to some train tracks. Upon coming to a train station, Mr. Jesse and a group of 10 men decided to storm it and kidnap an engineer, whom they had to beat in order to convince him to fire up a locomotive. Their destination was Tokyo.
They didn't know what would happen to them once they got there. There was the possibility they could be killed, but they hoped the enemy would be merciful in acknowledgment that the war had ended.
When they arrived, they were met by an Allied soldier. At last, they were in safe hands. They were soon transferred to a hospital on Guam in the mid-Pacific, and Mr. Jesse was finally able to phone home. Sadly, they left behind thousands of comrades - one in four Canadian PoWs had died in captivity, a vastly higher ratio than those who had been held by the Germans.
When he arrived back in Saskatchewan, an article in the Regina Leader-Post celebrated his homecoming. But he still wasn't out of the woods. Doctors worried he might have tuberculosis and would not let him see his parents until he submitted to an X-ray.
He was cleared, but the reunion remained brief. He was sent away to be treated for an ailment called beriberi, a vitamin deficiency caused by prolonged malnutrition that caused foot pain for the rest of his life.
After getting out of hospital, he felt well enough to attend a dance, where he met a young woman named Marcella Grimes. They fell in love and married in 1946. A year later, he and Reynold started Jesse's Meat Market in Estevan. But Mr. Jesse's career as a butcher wouldn't last long. The job was physically demanding and required long hours of work that aggravated his war injuries.
Instead, Mr. Jesse trained as a meteorologist and got a job with the department of transport, where he worked for 30 years. On the side, he and his wife owned and operated an insurance and real-estate company. They also raised five children.
Over the years, Mr. Jesse spent one term as a city councillor in Estevan, served on the local Catholic school board and was active in the Canadian Legion and in the Knights of Columbus.
Like many veterans, he never talked about what had happened to him during the war. Privately, he suffered unrelenting nightmares about the experience. He finally had a nervous breakdown and found himself back in hospital. He was treated by a doctor who urged him to tell his story.
Taking the advice to heart, he approached a neighbour named Norm Park, a newspaper columnist for the Estevan Mercury, for help. Initially, the project was intended to be read only by Mr. Jesse's children and grandchildren. However, as the story unfolded, Mr. Park realized it was too important and asked Mr. Jesse if he would consider writing a book with him.
The result was Seared in My Memory , which flew off the shelves and is now in its second printing. Surprised by its success, Mr. Jesse joked that he might have to be imprisoned a few more years so he could write another book.
BERNARD JESSE
Bernard Jesse was born Oct. 28, 1917, near Wordsworth, Sask. He died Mar. 23, 2008, at St. Joseph's Hospital in Estevan. He was 90. He is survived by daughter Marion and sons Warren, Colin and Howard. He was predeceased by his wife, Marcella, and by daughter Ferne.

Full text: Alliance of municipalities says province 'playing with fire' by not consulting them before deregulating private timberlands on Island
A series of private land-use deals between the province of B.C. and forestry companies, already under fire from environmentalists, has triggered a battle between Gordon Campbell's government and an influential alliance of local governments.
In a letter obtained by The Globe and Mail, a group representing 48 municipal and regional governments is calling on the Premier to review his government's decision to significantly deregulate forestry on 20,000 hectares of private timberlands on Vancouver Island by removing them from the tree-farm licence system.
"Local governments on Vancouver Island have expressed profound concerns that these lands were removed without adequate consultation," states the July 17 letter from Barry Janyk, president of the Association of Vancouver Island and Coastal Communities.
Mr. Janyk, who is also the mayor of Gibsons, said the issue is generating anger well beyond the affected communities.
"The provincial government ignores local government at their peril," he said. "An attack on one constituency is an attack on everyone. ... They are playing with fire."
Earlier this month, B.C. Auditor-General John Doyle found the most recent deal, worth $150-million to Western Forest Products, was made without due regard for the public interest.
Mr. Doyle said the government should have examined the impact of previous changes before granting the request of Western Forest Products, paving the way for an ambitious real-estate project around Jordan River despite opposition from the regional government. Jordan River is a tiny community between Sooke and Port Renfrew.
The largest of the previous changes took place four years ago in the Port Alberni valley, where almost 90,000 hectares of land were removed from managed tree-farm licences.
Port Alberni Mayor Ken McRae said the change, which he learned of only after the deal was signed, has had an impact on the city's water supply and on jobs.
He's disturbed by the amount of waste wood being left on the privately managed forest lands, which he sees as lost jobs for his struggling community.
As well, the city last year had to issue boil-water advisories that he believes can be tied to logging activity near the China Creek water intake.
Warren Lauder, the forest resource manager of the Hupacasath First Nation, also sees the private forestry operations around China Creek as a menace to fishing, hunting and sacred sites in his community's traditional territories.
Standing on a forestry road in the watershed last week, he laughed bitterly as he pointed out a couple of lonely fir trees, naked except for some tufts of green at their tops, left behind in a wide clear-cut.
"There's a wildlife-management stand for you."
The land used to support elk, deer and black bears. On this day, there is little sign of life in the exposed landscape.
The Hupacasath have been in court fighting to regain some control over what happens on the private timberlands around Port Alberni, and a ruling on consultation is expected from the B.C. Supreme Court in September.
The lands have been privately owned by various logging interests since 1887, but a large portion were under tree-farm licences that gave the timber companies access to public timber in exchange for a higher standard of regulation on their private lands.
Darshan Sihota, president of Island Timberlands, said the removal from the TFLs frees his company to respond to market demands without government dictating how much they can cut each year or where it can build logging roads. But he said the company is still committed to good logging practices.
Forestry analyst Ben Parfitt said the lack of regulation makes it hard to measure the true impact of private logging in watersheds.
His research does suggest the level of harvest has gone up considerably on private lands when they've been removed from TFLs.
"And there is a huge volume of wood being left behind; what impact that has on water quality and jobs forgone is anybody's guess," Mr. Parfitt said, "but it's not likely to be good."
Pat Bell, B.C.'s new Forests Minister, said in interview he doesn't believe government can undo past deals, but is considering whether private forest lands that have been removed from TFLs should be returned to his ministry for some degree of oversight.
And, he promised local government will have a say in future requests to delete private lands from TFLs.

Full text: Wild Coast Cottages
Location: Port Renfrew Developer: Three Point Properties
Price: Lots begin at $99,000; cottages start at $200,000
Size: Lots from 5,000 square feet to ½ acre
Sales centre: N/A
Contact: Phone 250-413-2164 or visit www.wildcoastcottages.com

As demand for recreational property in British Columbia continues to rise, so do prices. Three Point Properties hopes to have created an affordable solution with its West Coast Cottages, a release of 30 fully serviced lots in Port Renfrew, on Vancouver Island.
"Part of our concept for the first phase of development in Port Renfrew is to create a product that is not prohibitively expensive," says project manager Ben Mycroft.
By combining the smallest cottage plan from the development's preferred builder, Citta Group Construction, interested buyers can purchase a home-and-lot package for less than $300,000.
Citta Group has created a selection of house plans which range from two to four bedrooms between 1,180 square feet and 1,900 sq. ft.
"The entire process has been made very simple," Mr. Mycroft says.
"Financing has been arranged by a local Vancouver Island credit union. Purchasers are able to select from a variety of complementary West Coast contemporary cottage plans, and Citta Group Construction is mobilized to build cottages when the buyers are ready."
Purchasers are also free to use a builder of their choice, so long as their dwellings adhere to design guidelines to ensure consistency with neighbouring cottages and the surrounding wilderness.
Located on what is often called Vancouver Island's "forgotten coast," Port Renfrew offers an outdoor lifestyle that rivals Tofino, with great surf breaks, ocean and river fishing, boating and hiking. It is the starting point of the West Coast Trail and the end point of the Juan de Fuca Marine Trail.
While the development's location on the island's southwest coast offers a remote feel, Wild Coast Cottages is just a two-hour drive from Victoria or Duncan.
"Fishing in Port Renfrew can be a casual day experience," Mr. Mycroft notes. "You can drive there from Victoria or Duncan in the morning and be at your cottage and on the water by the afternoon."
Before offering the cottage lots to the general public, Three Point Properties released the project locally and met with "great" support, Mr. Mycroft says.
"Generally, local residents realize the benefits that will accrue to the town from investment in community infrastructure and amenities."
Several residents bought lots in the development, he say. "We attracted attention from local recreational home buyers and residents of Port Renfrew, who wanted to transition from their current home to a new home in a lovely area. Now, we're taking the project out to the wider world."

Full text: Enclave on Park Lane
Location: Mississauga
Builder/developer: RegalCraft Homes
Size: 3,500 to 5,500 square feet
Price: $832,900 to $1.2-million
Sales centre: northwest of the intersection of Eglinton Avenue and Winston Churchill Boulevard. Open Monday to Thursday, 1 to 8 p.m.; Friday by appointment only; weekends and holidays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Contact: (905) 828-7888 or www.regalcrafthomes.com
In the Lorne Park and Gordon Woods communities of Mississauga, RegalCraft Homes has built custom houses that range from 6,000 to 12,000 square feet in size, and start at $1.2-million.
But in its new development - Enclave on Park Lane - it's targeting the buyer who is looking for the luxuries of a custom-built residence but also for a quick closing date and more affordable price.
The local builder recently began construction on 41 executive homes on the site at Erin Centre and Winston Churchill boulevards. The two-storey residences will range from 3,500 to 5,500 square feet and sit on 40-foot-wide lots along a gently curving cul-de-sac. Buyers can customize homes - such as move walls or make a home wheelchair-accessible.
"Because of the product, price point and location, we're seeing brisk sales," says Meena Sharma, vice-president of sales and marketing. "We are more than half sold out."
Each home will situated on a deep lot and many will back on to nature trails that meander through wooded glens.
"We have one [lot] that is 120 feet deep and 80 [feet] wide in the back," Ms. Sharma notes.
The well-established neighbourhood has reputable schools, religious institutions and community centres, as well as shops and restaurants in and around Erin Mills Town Centre.
There are seven interior plans available, while exterior designs will draw on French/Norman, Gothic or Tudor styles. Facades will be brick and stone or brick and stucco, and homes also will feature double garages, balconies and large windows.
"[The residences are] very much going to be set apart from the other homes in the area," Ms. Sharma says. "They're bigger and they're all in an enclave, therefore it lends itself to more privacy and is arguably safer."
Floor plans will incorporate both formal and more casual principal rooms, 10-foot ceilings on the main floor (nine feet upstairs), and coffered ceilings throughout.
Interior decor will include hardwood and ceramic tile flooring, oak staircases with wrought-iron pickets, granite kitchen countertops and gas fireplaces.
Buyers can opt for as many as five bedrooms, nine-foot ceilings in the basement and backyard walkouts.
Lower levels can be partially finished with a fitness room, dry sauna, full bathroom and change room, as well as a cold cellar. Fully finished basements will come with those features as well as a home theatre, recreation room and wet bar.

Abstract: The fact is, bigger is not better. An AC unit that's too big is a waste of money to purchase, inefficient to operate, and isn't comfortable. An oversized unit will turn on and off more often, which is annoying and wasteful. So how do you make sure you don't get sold more cooling capacity than you should have?

Full text: Getting a high-efficiency unit is important, but they have to be installed properly and maintained regularly
Every summer the heat and humidity drives homeowners to turn up their air conditioners. If you've got an older unit, maybe it's time to think about replacing it with a new, more energy-efficient one.
Older air conditioners - both central and room - use 30- to 70-per cent more electricity than newer energy-efficient models, driving up peak demand and costing you more. In addition, older units can corrode or rust, leading to refrigerants, HCFCs and CFCs leaking and causing environmental damage and pollution. Air conditioners contain refrigerants like freon, that create the cooling effect. These are ozone-depleting substances and have global restrictions to ensure they are not released into the atmosphere.
BIGGER ISN'T ALWAYS BETTER
Window and portable units are effective for cooling small spaces, and cost a lot less than central AC, which cools the entire home.
The size of the air conditioning unit you need is entirely dependent on your home. Contractors bidding on central AC installation jobs often incorrectly estimate the tonnage needed. Some HVAC contractors over-estimate their clients' need to make absolutely sure their client has "plenty of cooling capacity," or sometimes simply to sell whatever unit they happen to have sitting on the truck or back at the shop.
The fact is, bigger is not better. An AC unit that's too big is a waste of money to purchase, inefficient to operate, and isn't comfortable. An oversized unit will turn on and off more often, which is annoying and wasteful. So how do you make sure you don't get sold more cooling capacity than you should have?
Make sure your HVAC contractor performs a load calculation using industry-recognized methods, to determine the proper size unit. It's important to take more than just household square footage into account. It's total home air volume that counts. The calculation also needs to take into account local climate conditions, and conditions unique to the house - such as the number of south-facing windows.
Remember, too, that newer houses are more energy-efficient. They have better insulation, quality of windows and greater air tightness, which all greatly affect the amount of cooling power you need.
ARE DUCTS BEING CHECKED?
There should be enough ducts, and they should carry enough air to ensure an adequate supply of cool air to every room - and, just as important, to ensure enough warm air gets back to the air conditioner. Also, the ducts should be as air tight as possible.
The ducts should flow through the conditioned space in your house. If they go through the attic, they should be insulated.
EFFICIENCY IS IMPORTANT
Once you figure out how big an AC unit you need, you'll want to get the most efficient unit you can. This is measured in something called SEER - Seasonal Energy Efficiency Rating. The higher the number, the more energy efficient the unit is.
Old units might have a SEER of 5. You want to go as high as you can - 16 or 18 is great. A SEER 10 will use half the electricity of a SEER 5 unit, and you'll pay for the price difference in energy savings in a few years.
SAVE ENERGY
Air conditioners are one of the biggest consumers of energy in your home, so you want to make sure yours is the most energy-efficient it can be. But even a very high-efficiency air conditioner will perform as badly as an inefficient one if it isn't installed correctly.
TIPS:
* Keep your blinds closed to avoid passive solar heating that will make your AC work harder.
* Close your windows and doors when the AC is on.
* Do laundry and run dishwashers - which create heat - in the evening when it's cooler to avoid peak hours.
* Make sure the condensing unit of your central AC is placed where it will be shaded from the sun.
* Keep the outdoor condensing unit clear of leaves and debris it will cause the unit to work extra hard and wear out sooner. Make sure there is enough space around the outdoor unit to avoid airflow restriction through the coils. Keep landscaping away from the AC unit.
* Try to place the condenser in a place that won't disturb you or your neighbours - they can be noisy.
* Use a programmable thermostat and set it to turn on your AC before you come home, so you're saving energy while you're at work during the day.

Full text: 109 FRONT ST. EAST, NO. 338
Asking price: $249,900
Selling price: $276,800
Taxes: $1,561 (2007)
Days on the market: seven
Listing agents: Ingrid Smith and David Proulx, Re/Max West Realty Inc.
This one-bedroom suite in a new building next to the St. Lawrence Market is fairly standard for units of this size in Toronto, agent David Proulx says. But since supply has been short and demand high for such properties, it fetched a $26,900 premium.
The downtown condo market has been really hot, the agent points out, adding: "It's the best price that a ... unit [without parking] has got in that building."
Situated on the third floor, the more than 600-square-foot suite is largely taken up by an open-concept living and dining room with carpeting and west-facing windows.
The kitchen, with a breakfast bar and three appliances, opens to the larger space, and there are marble floors throughout.
The unit also includes a four-piece bathroom and laundry closet. The bedroom has a walk-in closet.
"The layout was efficient, so the space was well used," Mr. Proulx says of the overall unit. "It was very clean, neat and open."
The monthly maintenance fee is about $260, which covers utilities, security and access to amenities such as a gym, rooftop patio and recreation room.
Local conveniences include shops, cafes, theatres and restaurants, as well as public transit.

Full text: Salah Bachir's vacation home is a silk purse of a house, astonishing onlookers with its old-world grandeur, Deirdre Kelly reports
With impish understatement, Salah Bachir calls his vacation home in Paris, Ont., a "country house," conjuring up the bucolic vision of a thatched-roofed cottage - an image he takes no pains to correct. Which is what makes the property so hard to find for a first-time visitor from Toronto.
You drive in circles around the town, expecting to find a cutoff that will take you to a log cabin in the woods. Then, believing you are lost, you stop to ask for directions. You are surprised when the person on the street immediately knows the address you're talking about: "You mean the mayor's house? Why, it's right over there."
Craning your neck in the direction of the pointed finger, you see an enormous gated fence. You blink because there's a sculpture you'd expect to find only in the other Paris. You push a button on the intercom, ready to apologize for being in the wrong place. But the gate swings slowly open, and then you see him: not the mayor, but the next best thing - the new lord of the manor, living a life of relaxed elegance.
"Come in, come in," Mr. Bachir says. "You don't mind using the servant's entrance do you?" He is grinning ear-to-ear, aware of the impact his so-called "cottage" has on those seeing it for the first time.
On occasion, Mr. Bachir has heightened that element of surprise by deliberately driving guests up the wrong path to a true rural abode, sinking verandah and all.
"They tell me how charming it is, thinking to be polite," says the well-known Toronto business executive and philanthropist, relishing the tale. "And then I tell them that if they tire of it, they can meet me up at the house, which, when I finally take them to it, they stare at in disbelief."
Quaint it isn't. At more than 9,000 square feet, the sheer scale of the place - not to mention its many rooms filled to the rafters with museum-worthy art - make anyone visiting it for the first time think they've arrived at the real centre of civilization.
Toronto and its gold-tinted condo towers, located less than an hour's drive to the east, seems crass in comparison.
A silk purse of a house, it astonishes all onlookers, including drivers who slow down as they pass, enchanted by its suggestion of old-world grandeur.
"When I'm here, I feel as if I'm really away from it all," Mr. Bachir says. "It's my retreat and my spa, where I surround myself with beauty, where I completely relax."
The former home of Charles Whitelaw, first mayor of Paris, it was built in 1842 in a melange of Tudor, Victorian and Georgian architectural styles borrowed from Mr. Whitelaw's native England.
The mayor was friends with Alexander Graham Bell, the inventor of the telephone who lived in nearby Brantford, and was a frequent visitor to the house in Paris. (In 1876, he received the first long-distance call - from Brantford - in a telegraph office a short walk away at 91 Grand River St. North.)
In those days, the 17-room house featured five bathrooms, and nine fireplaces whose mantels were made of hand-carved Carrara marble. Six remain in the house that today boasts 21 rooms, including five bedrooms and six remodelled bathrooms.
Despite an extensive renovation in which Mr. Bachir created a Zen-inspired, second-floor spa with a steam room, whirlpool tub, walk-in shower and soaring skylight, the house seems like it belongs to another place, another world. A feeling of stateliness remains, even in the renovated basement where the video game Wii dominates a large flat-screen TV.
Made of solid brick with pointed fretwork gables, the home still has such original details as etched-glass windows and ornamental plaster mouldings inside. Carved into a series of window frames in the front foyer are trilliums, the floral emblem of Ontario, a reminder that this was once home to the highest-ranking man in the town.
Giving the home its due, Mr. Bachir has decorated it with hand-cut Murano chandeliers that he purchased in Venice, and antique furniture and rugs bought in part at Jonny's Antiques in nearby Shakespeare, and Stanley Wagman & Son Antiques in Toronto.
Some of the more remarkable pieces include an 18th-century Chinese opium bed in the foyer, and a pair of large wooden angels in the dining room. Once part of a Baroque church in France, the angels adorn the red walls of the dining room, which also features a gold-leaf ceiling. The dining room table, dating from 1870, once belonged to Roland Michener, a former governor-general of Canada. Sitting on an antique carpet from Iran, the table can seat as many as 14 people.
Other rooms have a more contemporary feel, among them a front sitting room with adjoining sunroom, for which Toronto's LA Design created sage-coloured couches. Mr. Bachir encourages his guests to sprawl out on them, in order to better watch the sports channel.
"It's about creating the ultimate in comfort," he says. "I want everyone who comes here to feel that there are no airs, no ceremony. It's about kicking off your shoes, laying back, and feeling like you've come home."
That said, it is a weekend house. Mr. Bachir lives and works in Toronto, where he is president of Cineplex Media, which provides cinema advertising. He is also publisher of the in-theatre magazines Famous, Famous Quebec and Famous Kids.
He also serves as vice-chairman of the Canadian Foundation for AIDS Research, as well as chairman of the 519 Church St. Community Centre capital campaign, to which he personally donated $1-million.
As an arts patron and collector, he specializes in contemporary art, and has one of the world's largest private collections of Andy Warhol, in addition to many works by Canadian artist Attila Lukacs, many of which have never been shown publicly.
In addition to works by those two, his Paris house contains art by dozens of other artists, such as Keith Haring, Betty Goodwin, Frida Kahlo, General Idea (a collective that included Canadian artists Felix Partz, Jorge Zontal and AA Bronson), David Hockney, Robert Mapplethorpe and Jim Dine.
Bronze animal sculptures by Tom Dean, Canada's representative at the 1999 Venice Biennale, and pieces by other sculptors dot the immense, landscaped garden, which offers the fragrances of orange blossoms, roses and hydrangea flowers. This is where Mr. Bachir's beloved Tibetan terrier, Ella - named for jazz singer Ella Fitzgerald, whom Mr. Bachir knew and admired - chases the many chipmunks who freely roam the manicured lawns.
Martin Kohn of Kohn Shnier Architects executed much of the renovation of Mr. Bachir's Paris house, converting a first-floor breezeway into a contemporary entranceway featuring cherry wood, slate and glass, and a new window through which natural light floods.
"I wanted to mix the old style with a modern look," Mr. Bachir says, underscoring his appreciation for the here-and-now. "You can't copy something built 160 years ago and pretend it was built at that time. The trick is to make something that goes and flows and complements the architecture of the time, like the I.M. Pei pyramid at the Louvre, for example, which I think is a perfect blend of old and new."
Working in collaboration with local architect Paul Dowling, Mr. Kohn also executed the conversion of an upstairs bedroom into a spa-like retreat that, while it was being built, was the talk of the town.
"I was stopped in the local IGA by a woman who was scandalized that I would even dare to update the plumbing in such a historic home as this," Mr. Bachir recalls. "I turned to her and said, 'If Queen Victoria could have had heated floors in her day, she would have installed them, too.' "
Friends of Mr. Bachir quip that he bought the country house because he needed more wall space for his magnificent art collection. But Mr. Bachir says he just wanted to get away from the hectic pace of the city.
"I was travelling so much, and wanted to get away from downtown," he says, relaxing into the gentle sway of a rocking chair in his kitchen.
He hatched that plan 16 years ago, while sitting in a Toronto traffic jam.
Wishing for an escape, he flipped open a newspaper lying on the front seat of his car, where he saw an image of the house listed for sale. He noted it was stately.
"I asked a friend if he knew anything about Paris, Ontario," recalls Mr. Bachir. (He eventually discovered that the town, first settled in 1829 along the banks of the Grand River, was named for its nearby deposits of gypsum, the material used to make plaster of Paris.)
The friend did, and coincidentally, was going to a dinner party there the next day. He asked Mr. Bachir to come along.
As fate would have it, the dinner party took place in the very house he had just seen in the newspaper.
Mr. Bachir remembers every detail of that first encounter.
"I was sitting in the living room, admiring the mouldings, the high ceilings, the astonishing architectural detail, and I thought, wow, what I could do with a place like this." The rest, as they say, is history.

Full text: For those who are unfamiliar with it, Parry Sound may conjure up the image of a sprinkling of cottages along Georgian Bay. In fact, it's a long-thriving town that's currently experiencing a major boom, according to Perry Harris, president of the local Chamber of Commence.
With a population that goes from about 18,000 in the winter to about 60,000 in the summer, the town and its surrounding area are "diverse," Mr. Harris says. It offers a range of professional, business and recreational opportunities for everyone from young parents to retirees.
The boom is being fuelled mostly by urbanites who are relocating there. They may already have a cottage in the area, he adds, also noting that some may start a small business or seek employment in the town.
The increasing development of the area, which is about 225 kilometres north of Toronto, is attracting more young people, Mr. Harris explains, and changing the plus-50 demographic that has been predominant.
"We have new stores coming in. Home Depot is coming in; Starbucks is coming in," he says. "We have a Lick's restaurant opening up. That's a nice nod to the town.
"We're just a hidden gem up here."

Full text: Stratford
Location: Lawrence Park
Builder/developer: Cresford Developments
Size: 1,550 to 4,275 square feet
Price: $1.2-million to $4.6-million
Sales centre: 2130 Bayview Ave., south of Lawrence Avenue East. Open by appointment.
Contact: (416) 971-7888 or www.stratfordresidences.ca
*****
Stratford in Lawrence Park is one of city's few developments that features low-rise buildings with large suites and high-end appointments, and that is set amid gardens and mature trees, according to its builder, Cresford Developments.
It's a package - complete with 1,550- to 4,275-square-foot models, private elevators and 11-foot ceilings - that has attracted locals who live in historic mansions as well as empty-nesters accustomed to upscale properties in Florida, Cresford says.
"[Buyers are] coming from a house in Toronto or have had experience with condominiums down south, so they're expecting certain details," explains Maria Athanasoulis, Cresford vice-president of sales and marketing. "They love all the luxuries."
Located off Bayview Avenue, south of Lawrence Avenue, the project will include 60 units within two four-storey residences. A mid-rise building with just seven suites and 17 detached houses will be released in the coming months.
Two well-known companies - J.F. Brennan Design/Build Inc. and Gluckstein Design Planning Inc. - were recruited to give the community a classic, Georgian-style appearance that will blend in with homes in the affluent neighbourhood.
Stratford will be nestled against the park of the same name, and be minutes from Sherwood Park, Sunnybrook Park and the Rosedale Golf Club. On the site itself, the builder is preserving the natural surroundings by relocating mature trees from the construction site to the perimeters. Courtyard gardens will also be created on the grounds.
Mainstays in the area are the Granite Club, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre and York University's Glendon campus. Bayview shops, restaurants, gourmet grocers and cafes are also nearby.
Residents will have exclusive use of a gym, pool and party room with a fireplace, bar and kitchen. Other amenities include a guest suite, 18-hour valet service and 24-hour concierge.
Key-operated elevators will shuttle owners and guests directly to suites. "The fact they don't have to walk down a long corridor is a big selling feature," Ms. Athanasoulis says.
Designed much like detached homes, models have large principal rooms. Most units will have family rooms, guest suites with private bathrooms, and master bedrooms with sitting rooms and his and hers closets.
Residents will be able to enjoy the outdoors from balconies, patios and gardens with barbecue hookups. An optional feature in penthouse units is a kitchen that opens to a rooftop terrace.
"We've attracted some buyers from the other neighbouring buildings because they didn't have the outdoor space that they were looking for," Ms. Athanasoulis notes. "You can't barbecue at some of the other buildings."
Kitchens will be stocked with Downsview cabinetry and Sub-Zero, Wolf and Miele appliances.
Among the other interior features are gas fireplaces, decorative columns, and master bathrooms with heated floors. Countertops will have granite, marble or CaesarStone finishes.
Units will be equipped with central vacuum systems and high-efficiency washers and dryers.
Underground parking and a locker are included.
The monthly maintenance fee is 51 cents a square foot, not including utilities.
Occupancy is slated for fall, 2010.

Full text: In ongoing battle, Capital Region demands Western Forest Products seek permits for preparatory work on disputed development
While lawyers prepare for a court battle over Western Forest Products' attempts to sell off timberlands for real-estate development, company employees were still clearing land yesterday to stake out its proposed subdivision boundaries.
But even that work could soon be stalled. The local government has issued a warning letter as a prelude to seeking an injunction against the forest company's preliminary work on its private lands.
The former timberlands on the west coast of Vancouver Island have been at the centre of controversy since the provincial government agreed to lift forestry restrictions from the properties last year.
The Capital Regional District, the regional authority for land-use issues in and around Victoria, sent Western Forest Products a written demand that the company obtain permits to do even preparatory work on the subdivisions.
"What may not be clear to them is, they cannot alter the land without permits," Robert Lapham, general manager for the CRD's planning department, said in an interview yesterday. "If they aren't prepared to comply, we would have to seek an injunction."
The CRD has made no secret of its opposition to the forest company's real-estate plans - it has already tried to block the development by changing the zoning throughout the rural, waterfront strip of the island between Sooke and Jordan River. In April, it changed the zoning bylaws to allow properties to be subdivided into lots no smaller than 48 hectares.
That move elicited a weighty response from Western Forest Products, in the form of a 412-page petition in B.C. Supreme Court seeking to quash the zoning changes.
The company is set to appear in court on Sept. 15. Court documents filed by the company argue the CRD "exceeded its authority, exceeded its jurisdiction, committed an error of law or acted unreasonably" in its bid to slow development on the former timberlands.
The CRD argues that its official community plan for the region calls for limited growth in the area, and the lands were expected to remain "renewable resource working landscapes."
That vision changed when Western Forest Products listed some of its waterfront properties with realtor Colliers International, hoping to relieve some of its debt pressures. The 2,550 hectares put on the block included valuable south-facing waterfront and were provisionally sold to a developer who wants to create a new town of 10,000 at Jordan River.
In order to develop the lands, the company needed the Ministry of Forests to remove restrictions from its private forestry lands, an agreement it won early last year.
Last week, B.C. Auditor-General John Doyle criticized the government's handling of that decision, saying then-forests minister Rich Coleman failed to consider the public interest when he agreed to delete the lands from the Tree Farm Licence program.
The change was worth an estimated $150-million to the company, but the province sought no compensation.
Duncan Kerr, chief operating officer of Western Forest Products, said yesterday the company is carrying on its preparation of the subdivisions according to the old zoning bylaws that allow for smaller lots. It has until April, 2009, to obtain development approval from the provincial Transportation Ministry, a process that is still under way.
Mr. Kerr said the company is reviewing the latest demands from the CRD, but said he would have preferred to work with the local government without resorting to litigation.
"We think that's far from optimal," he said. "We're very disappointed that we have been unable to engage with the CRD, local planners and local communities. Instead it has become this provincial political issue with groups getting involved who have nothing to do in the local region."
A coalition of environmentalists yesterday called on Premier Gordon Campbell to reverse the Forest Ministry decision.

Abstract: FOOD AND DRINK Jordan's Crossing, the hotel's lakeside restaurant and outdoor patio, evokes the fine dining rooms of first-class rail travel. Overlooking the lake, it offers a year-round prix-fixe menu featuring the chef's favourites, along with an à la carte menu. Executive chef Julian Owen-Mold, fresh from his last gig at Vancouver's Opus Hotel, has developed a fine locally-sourced menu. Line-caught salmon was sublime, as was the olive oil-poached lamb and Pacific sablefish.

Full text: NITA LAKE LODGE
2131 Lake Placid Road, Whistler, B.C.; 1-888-755-6482 or 604-966-5700; www.nitalakelodge.com.
ROOMS AND RATES
Studio suites start at $149, one-bedroom suites from $189, and two-bedrooms at $259. The hotel also has two extra-large suites, tucked away from the action on top of the train station: The two-bedroom Hudson Suite starts at $1,499, while the one-bedroom Pacific Suite starts at $1,249.
With all the hotels in Whistler, you'd think there was already something for everyone. But until Nita Lake Lodge opened earlier this year, a cozy lakeside lodge wasn't an option. Five years in the building, the lodge has a coveted location overlooking Nita Lake and it's just a five-minute stroll from Creekside village, the quieter half of Whistler.
Guests can avoid the pre-Olympic construction and traffic along the Sea to Sky Highway by hopping on the Whistler Mountaineer from Vancouver, a spectacular train journey that crosses canyons that can't been seen from the highway. The luxury train pulls up at an elegant arts-and-crafts-style station next door to the hotel.
LOCATION That old real estate adage - location, location, location - holds equally true for hotels. Either you want to be in the centre of the village where everything is happening or you're looking for a peaceful retreat. In the case of Nita Lake Lodge, you get the best of both worlds. If you are craving a little action, the hotel's shuttle is always at the ready to take you to the main village and smaller Creekside. Lift access to the mountain, is just steps away.
But there's serenity, too: Half of the 77 suites look out over the lake and the other half look out at Whistler Mountain, which will be home to the men's and women's 2010 Olympic downhill race.
AMBIENCE Lots of stone and a generous use of rich, dark wood make for a grand lobby, with well-chosen local artwork and elegant furnishings. The two-sided fireplace in the lounge is a prime gathering spot for après-activity drinks, and the natural palette of moss, coffee brown and sienna is easy on the eyes.
DESIGN Think arts and crafts meets the great outdoors. Lead architect Peter Lang worked hard to make the hotel feel like it belongs here. Shed dormers hark back to the original fishing lodge that was located here and lend the lodge a rustic, hand-hewn feel. Over-scale beams and columns evoke that golden era of "parkitecture," when travelling to majestic alpine settings demanded buildings of a similar grandeur.
ROOMS All the suites have comfy king size beds that sit fashionably low to the floor, with expansive floor-to-ceiling sliding doors that open up to patios with spectacular views of Nita Lake and Whistler Mountain. Like all suites, our one-bedroom featured a 42-inch plasma television over the fireplace and an oversized ensuite bathroom with a huge soaker tub. Stand-alone glass showers are easily big enough for two, and the slate floors with radiant heating will be welcome in winter.
FOOD AND DRINK Jordan's Crossing, the hotel's lakeside restaurant and outdoor patio, evokes the fine dining rooms of first-class rail travel. Overlooking the lake, it offers a year-round prix-fixe menu featuring the chef's favourites, along with an à la carte menu. Executive chef Julian Owen-Mold, fresh from his last gig at Vancouver's Opus Hotel, has developed a fine locally-sourced menu. Line-caught salmon was sublime, as was the olive oil-poached lamb and Pacific sablefish. For breakfast and lunch, JC's Café and Deli is the best place in Creekside to grab a coffee and something nutritious before heading for the hills. If a more decadent breakfast is in order, try Owen-Mold's orange-scented waffles, topped with fragrant strawberries and fresh cream. A selection of fresh-baked muffins stacked in beautiful wooden baskets are irresistible.
THINGS TO DO As a four-season resort, Whistler offers up just as many (if not more) activities in the summer as in the winter. You can arrive in style on the Whistler Mountaineer train (604-606-7200); hook up with Zip Trek Ecotours (604-935-0001) and fly along one of five steel ziplines; go on a pedal-paddle trip with Whistler Eco-Tours (604-935-4900).
*****
Hotel vitals
TOP DRAWS
With the new train station integrated into the project, Nita Lake has become a gateway to Whistler. Considering the hotel's mountainside ski storage, shuttle service and easy access to the ski hill via the Creekside gondola, guests can do without a car.
NEEDS WORK
The Valley Trail, used by cyclists, joggers and skateboarders alike, is steps away from the lodge, so a fleet of bikes would be a welcome addition to hotel amenities.

Full text: THE COMPANY REMARKABLE SURFACING The Problem Breaking into a crowded marketplace, attracting and retaining workers The Plan Rebrand and reposition the company, competitive employee packages The Payoff Greater market share, stable labour base
Daren Tracey and his business partner, Chris Kelly, are hoping they will soon be walking all over their competition. Their months-old, Halifax-based company, Remarkable Surfacing, is aiming to cement itself in the firmly established and very crowded world of contract paving.
"I think we have a very unique product to offer the market here," Mr. Tracey says, referring to paving patterns and imprints that can be placed on any surface that would normally accept conventional asphalt, concrete or stone base overlay.
Along with residential driveways, Remarkable Surfacing hopes to capitalize on the construction boom in local industrial, institutional and commercial complexes. "New buildings are going up all over the place and they are all going to require parking lots, drive-ups and drive-throughs," Mr. Tracey says. "And as older sites get revamped, their road surfaces will need to be upgraded as well, especially after the long, harsh winters."
Indeed, Mr. Tracey and his partner recognize the opportunity that comes with each spring thaw. "Halifax roads become an obstacle course of potholes and present a real danger to drivers and their vehicles," he says. "Our surfaces dry quickly, which slows down the formation of ice, and they are unaffected by salt. Plus, they are smooth, with no trip points and little potential for damage by snowplows.
"And," he adds, "at about one-third of the cost of conventional paving, they could save the City of Halifax hundreds of thousands of dollars in road repair work each year."
Despite his conviction, Mr. Tracey says making a name in a smaller market that already boasts more than 100 competitors has been a challenge. "Sure, we have picked up a few residential jobs here and there through word-of-mouth referrals, but for the most part, nobody knows who we are or what we have to offer."
Finding a good mix of skilled, full-time employees who can oversee project layout and design, as well as a part-time crew to handle the heavier labour, has also been a major concern. "Even hiring students on for the summer has been a real challenge," he says.
"If we want to grow our business here, and eventually across other parts of Atlantic Canada," he says. "We could really use some direction in these areas."
WHAT THE EXPERTS SAY
Don Veinish is the vice-president and creative director of Cossette Atlantic, a Halifax-based marketing and communications firm. He says he believes the first step to growing any business is to understand the marketplace. "It is vital that they are clear on who they are eyeing as customers," he says.
Once a target market has been established, Mr. Veinish recommends rebranding the business accordingly. "If they call themselves 'Remarkable,' then their materials should better reflect that than they currently do. Their website, business cards, letterhead, signage, brochures, fliers, advertising materials and trade-show gear must clearly convey who they are."
But a corporate makeover isn't enough to attract customers. "Potential clients have to be educated on the company's competitive advantages," he says. "What is it that makes the company remarkable? ... What is in it for the customers?"
After establishing a simple and concise message, Mr. Tracey and his partner must look at advertisingstrategy. "For residential customers, I would recommend using a mix of media," Mr. Veinish says. "At the core would be a large display advertisement in the local phone book, supported by strategically placed collateral ads in newspapers, home and lifestyle magazines and perhaps even area cable television stations."
Going door-to-door with business cards, brochures and fliers - especially in newer neighbourhoods is also a cost-effective way to get the word out. "And make sure that signage is visible when you are out on a job," he says. "You never know who is going to be watching from their doorstep or driving by."
For commercial and industrial properties, Mr. Veinish says it is all about who you know. "Get out there and schmooze," he says. "Ads in trade publications are good, but developing partnerships with contractors, construction firms, developers, design companies, engineers, architects and real estate agents is a more effective way to keep their company top of mind with sector insiders. Signing on with industry associations will give them instant credibility with these people as well."
It also might help them with their ongoing labour issues, says Andre Lambert, co-owner of Lambert Brothers Paving in Calgary. "These business organizations have become invaluable, especially when it comes to sharing best practices in the field of human resources," he says. Mr. Lambert, who handles much of his company's sales and marketing initiatives with his younger siblings Paul and David, says younger companies like Remarkable Surfacing need both veterans and rookies on the job.
He says he believes there are a number of options open to entice and retain full-time employees.
"Slightly higher-than-average sector wages - even just a couple of dollars per hour more - combined with a health plan that offers basic coverage is a good start and likely more than the competition is offering," he says. "Bonuses for performance, safety record and length of employment are also excellent incentives for keeping people, as is the opportunity for them to upgrade skills through company-sponsored courses, seminars and workshops."
Professionalism will likely leave a positive impression upon job seekers. "Having the most up-to-date gear will show candidates how serious the company is about competing in the marketplace," Mr. Lambert says. "And formal safety and first-aid training are an absolute must."
Developing a personable environment will also help to create a sense of belonging. "Little things like monthly lunches, weekend softball games or holiday get-togethers will help to foster a family environment," he adds. "In this sector, keeping good people is as much about job satisfaction as it is about earning a good living."
In a nutshell
Positioning: Rebrand the company to appeal to its target market.
Messaging: Develop and deliver a concise and simple message to residential markets through a mix of creative and directive advertising media.
Networking: Involvement with industry associations will generate opportunities for commercial-industrial work and offer possible solutions for labour issues.
Attraction & Retention: A competitive, bonus-laden package and a professional, personable company environment, will lure and keep employees.

Full text: In the last decade, logging in British Columbia has suffered economic pains no one had ever imagined, from steep U.S. tariffs to a strong Canadian dollar. The wounds cut deep and cut often - and have so withered the once-powerful industry that some, inside and outside, now ask ...
More than a century ago, Don Bendickson's grandfather started chopping trees on Vancouver Island, joining hundreds of others in a historic timber rush.
Today, like his grandfather and father before him, Mr. Bendickson makes his living from the woods, running two companies that work on Vancouver Island and the mainland's central coast.
His son works with him, and Mr. Bendickson likes to think future generations of his family might also find their calling in the woods.
"I believe there is a future - but it's obviously changing," says Mr. Bendickson, whose Benwest and Stafford Lake logging companies harvest timber for customers that include publicly traded forestry firms and Indian bands.
Mr. Bendickson is one of a vanishing breed of those who make their living by cutting, hauling or processing trees on Vancouver Island. Up and down the island, mills, equipment suppliers and contractors are dropping like flies, felled by the worst market conditions in decades. Woes include a sickly U.S. housing market, export tariffs under the Softwood Lumber Agreement with the United States and the strong Canadian dollar.
In June, Mr. Bendickson took another blow when Duncan-based Western Forest Products Inc., which has already announced a string of cutbacks, announced more shutdowns that will hit 650 Western employees and 1,200 contractors - including 35 people in one of Mr. Bendickson's crews.
Once that crew's contract wraps up, Mr. Bendickson expects some workers may follow others who commute from British Columbia's Comox Valley to jobs in Alberta's oil patch.
The changes reflect more than a temporary lag in demand for two-by-fours. Demographic and real-estate trends on the island have resulted in forest companies assessing their properties to see if some can be put to "higher and best use." Sites once considered valuable only for timber are being eyed for golf courses and condominiums, as well as airports, hospitals and industrial parks.
Take Campbell River, where Mr. Bendickson's operations are based. The city wears its resource history on its sleeve, greeting visitors with the telltale billow of a smokestack in the sky and the smell of wood pulp in the breeze.
That history may be headed for the shelf. In May, Vancouver-based TimberWest Forest Corp. closed its Elk Falls sawmill in Campbell River, adding another 260 people to the roster of thousands in B.C. who have lost forestry jobs in recent years.
This month, Richmond-based Catalyst Paper Corp. announced it would close its Elk Falls pulp mill, throwing another 440 people out of work.
Meanwhile, new homes with ocean views are springing up on property formerly owned by TimberWest. The company is talking to city officials about other parcels that might prove suitable for development.
TimberWest says forestry will remain the primary use for up to 80 per cent of its holdings. Still, the company's strategy speaks to a reshaping of island resources that may be as significant as the pell-mell harvesting of a hundred years ago.
"The strip of the island right from Campbell River to Victoria has become a bit of a haven for retirees from right across the country," Mr. Bendickson says.
"People who are retired don't really want to see the smokestacks. It's 'I'm retired now. I want the golf courses, I want the clean water to go fishing in.' ... All of a sudden you get a very different direction for the town."
LAND RUSH
That direction appears to be moving away from a model that saw lumberjacks head into the woods and mills and towns spring up behind them.
Largely as a result of railway land grants dating back to the early 1900s, TimberWest holds big chunks of property on the Island - about 11 per cent by land mass.
Other forestry companies are also major landowners on the island, where about 20 per cent of the land base is in private hands, compared with about 5 per cent in the rest of the province.
Much of that land is in scenic areas close to metropolitan centres. Ninety-four per cent of the population on Vancouver Island - where real-estate prices have soared by 144 per cent since 2001 - lives within 20 minutes of TimberWest "development nodes," says a June report by Dundee Securities Corp.
As would-be purchasers eye a piece of paradise, some neighbours are getting testy. On the western side of the island, there's an uproar over Western Forest's plans to sell chunks of land between Sooke and Jordan River to a developer. In response to public outcry, B.C. Auditor-General John Doyle investigated a 2007 provincial government decision that gave Western permission to remove the properties from provincially regulated Tree Farm Licences and put it up for sale.
His report earlier this week damned former forests minister Rich Coleman's failure to consult with the public and local government, and described the minister's analysis of the potential impacts as flimsy. "I would have expected to see the documentation that supported the decision to be beyond reproach," Mr. Doyle said. "We found it inadequate." Pat Bell, the new Forests Minister, rejected the findings and Mr. Doyle's methodology. He said "there are no recommendations in here that we can take forward and take as constructive criticism."
In a sign of the times, the Western Canada Wilderness Committee - which has campaigned to keep loggers out of old-growth forests in Clayoquot Sound, the Stein Valley and elsewhere in B.C. - in June teamed up with the United Steelworkers to call for a Forest Land Reserve that would protect forest lands from urban sprawl. (United Steelworkers represents about 7,000 B.C. coast forest workers.) "The environmentalists have now understood that maybe it's better to have a working forest than to have a working subdivision," says Dave Lewis, executive director of the Truck Loggers Association, which represents contract operators such as Mr. Bendickson and has seen many of its members fold this year.
"We used to say it was 'cut and run,' " says Vicky Husband, a long-time environmental activist who is involved in the campaign to have the province block the Western Forest land sales. "Now we say it's 'log and flog.' " Ms. Husband and other activists have asked for meetings with Mr. Bell and Community Development Minister Blair Lekstrom, both appointed in a June cabinet shuffle, in the hopes of blocking the transaction.
Western Forest, for its part, has closed a conditional sale of the contentious properties, which were subdivided into 319 lots (averaging about five hectares each) before the Capital Regional District down-zoned the area to restrict small parcels. Western Forest contacted the CRD before putting the land up for sale, but the district expressed no interest in purchasing the sites, says Western Forest spokesman Duncan Kerr.
Such property won't come cheap. Last year, TimberWest sold nearly 10,000 hectares of land comprising the Leech Watershed to the Capital Regional District. The land will bolster the Sea to Sea Green Blue Belt, a planned wilderness corridor running from Saanich Basin on the eastern Island to Sooke Basin in the southwest.
The price? Some $64.7-million.
FORESTS AT WORK
In Campbell River, union headquarters on a rainy Monday is deserted. Flyers tacked to bulletin boards advertise jobs in Alberta.
Duane Riddoch won't be moving, but he is getting out of the business. Now 40, he started working at TimberWest's Elk Falls sawmill in his 20s.
The number of employees at the mill dwindled over the years and, in May, TimberWest dropped the axe, announcing the mill's permanent closing.
After 13 years during which he worked at nearly every production job at the mill and developed the back problems to prove it, Mr. Riddoch is studying to become an accountant. He doesn't have much hope that jobs like his will return.
"The rationalization hasn't ended," says Mr. Riddoch, who was involved in an unsuccessful employee effort to buy the mill.
"And with none of the forest companies willing to sit down and work together, there is not a hope of sawmilling in B.C. in the short term to survive."
In Campbell River, Don Bendickson hopes he can tough out a grim cycle. Demand could pick up once the U.S. housing market bottoms out and after a pine-beetle-fuelled harvesting boom in the B.C. Interior runs its course. A new marketing campaign is pitching wood as a climate-friendly building material.
Like Ms. Husband, he sees the island at a crossroads. Companies such as his are struggling, local governments are grappling with dwindling commercial tax bases and parts of the island are under unprecedented development pressure.
Royal commissions and other studies have long said the coast needed fewer, bigger manufacturing facilities and vastly reduced numbers of workers to survive, Mr. Bendickson says.
"That's what's going to happen," he says, "but a lot of people aren't prepared to accept the price of getting there."
An industry in crisis
The B.C. forestry industry is suffering through what many believe are the worst financial times of its existence. Mills are closed, companies are bankrupt, workers are laid off and fleeing to other trades.

Abstract: Beyond its moments of poignancy and faltering, [Stephens Gerard Malone]'s book raises interesting questions about the multiple literary genres he's probing. The point of historical novels, I suppose, is to tell us something about what it felt like at another time, something that history can't quite tell us. I think Malone's street-level story of the era at least partially succeeds in that aim. He's not the first, of course, to cover the territory.

Full text: I STILL HAVE A SUITCASE
IN BERLIN
By Stephens Gerard Malone
Random House Canada,
319 pages, $32.95
In Berlin, you'll find more monuments to the catastrophes of history than in any other city in Europe. Given German history, I suppose that's appropriate.
In May, civic officials unveiled the city's latest memorial. Located at the edge of the Tiergarten, Berlin's central park, it's right across the road from one of the German capital's largest memorials, a field of more than 1,000 tombstone-like dark-grey stelae, spread over five undulating hectares, honouring the memory of the six million European Jews murdered during the Nazi-caused Holocaust of the Second World War.
The new memorial, which remembers the experiences of homosexuals during the same Nazi era, when thousands of gay men were arrested, sometimes castrated, and often sent to concentration camps where many of them died, is a more modest affair. It consists of a sloping, three-metre-high concrete box that deliberately but politely echoes the vast field of slabs across the street. The no-frills, mausoleum-like container includes a small window that lets adult visitors look in and see a 90-second film loop of two young men kissing. Local art critics have praised it for its elegance, wit and understated way of making its historical point.
How to make a historical point or portrait, and how to judge history (and its monuments) is the formidable task that Canadian writer Stephens Gerard Malone sets for himself (and yes, his slightly unusual first name does make his tripled-barrelled moniker sound like a law firm). Nova Scotia-based Malone's historical, gay-subthemed novel about Berlin in the 1930s, I Still Have a Suitcase in Berlin , sheds a gruesome light on why, more than a half-century later, there are memorials to Jewish victims of the Holocaust as well as to Nazi-persecuted homosexuals.
The protagonist of Malone's tale, Michael Renner, a German-Canadian working-class 25-year-old living in Halifax during the depths of the 1930s Depression, is shipped off to Berlin to attend to his dying paternal grandmother. In short order, through his German relatives, the politically and sexually very naive Canadian gains entree to middle-class Nazi circles. Simultaneously, an assortment of friends introduce Renner to Berlin's notorious sexual and artistic demimonde. The two worlds overlap at the edge of the orgy. For an impressionable young man fresh from Halifax Harbour, the combination is volatile, and ultimately lethal for almost everybody involved.
The book's title is taken from that of a post-Second World War German ballad made popular by Marlene
Dietrich, a song of nostalgic fondness for her hometown (that's why she keeps "a suitcase in Berlin"), but Malone's prose, while serviceable, doesn't exactly sing. The novelist gets credit for his recreation of swastika-bedecked Berlin in the 1930s, but the ever-darkening set is peopled with stock characters who seldom come to life: various "good Germans" nastily scrambling up the Nazi ladder; a military intelligence lieutenant, at once civilized and sadistic; a male queen bee named Tristan, who runs a vast underground bunker-palace of decadence; and Jan, an elusively beautiful teenaged rent-boy from the streets. They all perform what feel like small-screen turns in a made-for-TV melodrama.
The real problem is Malone's vapid main character, Michael Renner. Malone wants to show us how a socially passive, not particularly thoughtful but deeply closeted young gay man can drift into Nazi evil, a loveless semi-arranged marriage, fatherhood and even inarticulate forbidden love. The trouble is that Renner is neither very interesting nor sympathetic as he unreflectively helps to make the Nazi trains run on time - trains that will ultimately carry Jews, political dissidents, homosexuals and many others to the death camps. That Renner remains in dimly understood sexual denial while everyone around him seems to instantly recognize his same-sex desires doesn't help.
The concluding years of the decade-long story, in bomb-blitzed wartime Berlin and with Renner on the run, is a genuine and harrowing reminder of what human beings did. One can still visit the former concentration camp - today a memorial site - at Sachsenhausen, just outside Berlin, and conjure up the ghosts of inhumanity. The horror of Malone's Suitcase in Berlin is all too believable, but the novel is less so, undercut as it is by the melodramatic tying up of every loose end in the unravelled yarn.
Beyond its moments of poignancy and faltering, Malone's book raises interesting questions about the multiple literary genres he's probing. The point of historical novels, I suppose, is to tell us something about what it felt like at another time, something that history can't quite tell us. I think Malone's street-level story of the era at least partially succeeds in that aim. He's not the first, of course, to cover the territory. Perhaps the most engaging of such efforts is Philip Kerr's historical detective-novel trilogy, Berlin Noir , also set in 1930s and '40s Berlin, while Joseph Kanon's The Good German does similar duty for the immediate postwar period in Berlin.
Malone's novel also echoes a trend in recent gay-themed fiction. In what is today almost a "post-gay" period, given that many issues of gay identity, legal rights and even public acceptance of homosexuality have been largely resolved, writers have turned to gay history for their subject matter. Alan Hollinghurst's The Line of Beauty (the 2005 Man Booker Prize winner), Colm Toibin's The Master (a 2004 novel about novelist Henry James) and Jamie O'Neil's vibrantly Joycean saga of Irish gay history, At Swim, Two Boys (2001), have all delved into the same-sex past. Malone joins that company, though his writing is hardly of the same first rank as that of the others I've named.
However, there's a more telling comparison that must be made, even though it doesn't favour any contemporary author, including Malone. If you want a literary account of Berlin in the 1930s, the first bookshelf to go to is the one containing the works of Christopher Isherwood, who was on the spot when it all happened. In Mr. Norris Changes Trains (1935), Goodbye to Berlin (1939), Down There on a Visit (1961) and the memoir Christopher and His Kind (1976), Isherwood indelibly recorded the chill of the impending Nazi doom, as well as capturing the frisson of the "Life is a Cabaret" culture and the restless currents of homoerotic attraction. It's hard to see how anyone could better such masterpieces. Malone at least gets marks for the attempt.
These days, if you're as nostalgically fond of Berlin as Marlene Dietrich was, it's probably a good idea not only to keep "a suitcase in Berlin" but, given the uncertainties of the real-estate market, to keep an apartment there as well. You'll want some shelter from the wreckage of history.
Stan Persky teaches philosophy at Capilano University in North Vancouver, and has lived part-time in Berlin since 1990. He's the author of, among other books, Then We Take Berlin: Stories from the Other Side of Europe (1995).

Full text: The Grove
Location: Ajax
Builder/developer: Tribute Communities
Size: townhouses, 1,704 to 1,845 square feet; detached, 1,976 to 2,771 square feet
Price: townhouses, $279,990 to $299,990; detached, $369,990 to $427,990
Sales centre: 365 Kingston Rd., east of Salem Road. Open Monday to Thursday, 1 to 8 p.m.; weekends, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.
Contact: (905) 239-0674 or www.tributecommunities.com
The Grove's central location in Ajax has proved to be one of its major draws, the builder says, with the potential to shorten buyers' daily commute, offer a more relaxed lifestyle outside a large metropolitan centre, or provide an opportunity for locals to stay within the lakeside town.
The project by Tribute Communities will total 134 freehold townhouses and single-family homes on 40-foot lots bordering Carruthers Creek off Kingston and Salem roads.
"We're getting people that are coming from other areas of Durham because of the amenities that are close by this site," says Scott McLellan, senior vice-president of sales and marketing.
"We're seeing people trying to move a little closer to the city for work reasons. We're also seeing people moving out of the city because you're getting better value and a house from a top builder that's still easy to access the city."
Travelling in and out of town will be easy via Highway 401 to the south of the site, major GO bus routes nearby and a GO Train station situated a short drive west.
The site is minutes from schools and shopping, including the Durham Centre, as well as recreational outlets such as a splash pad and skateboard park at the McLean Community Centre and a pool, indoor rock-climbing facilities, arenas and squash courts at the Ajax Community Centre.
There are parks, conservation areas and golf courses throughout Ajax, in addition to a ravine system that extends to the edge of the Grove site.
"It gives it a really unique sense of being in the country," says Mr. McLellan.
Available models will have Georgian and colonial-style exteriors with brick and siding, in addition to rows of large windows, balconies and frieze boards.
Interior plans include combined living and dining rooms, eat-in kitchens opening to great rooms, upper-level laundry rooms and master suites with walk-in closets and private bathrooms.
The detached models will offer three or four bedrooms, double garages and libraries in many cases.
Among the most popular designs are those with family retreats and living rooms between the main and second floors, says Mr. McLellan.
"You have three levels of a house, basically built within the framework of a traditional two-storey house," he says. "We utilize the space over the garage, so it's a really unique and interesting layout."
Townhouses will have three bedrooms and single-car garages.
The main-floor ceilings will be nine feet high, and some models will come with oak veneer staircases and gas fireplaces with wood surrounds and mantels.
Occupancy is expected to begin in November, 2009.

Full text: Macleod's Landing
Location: Richmond Hill
Builder: Aspen Ridge Homes
Size: townhouses, 1,458 to 2,056 square feet; detached on 36-foot lots, 1,690 to 2,311 square feet
Price: townhouses, $340,990 to $412,990; detached on 36-foot lots, $420,990 to $489,990
Sales centre: Yonge Street, across from Stouffville Road. Open Monday to Thursday, 1 to 8 p.m.; weekends and holidays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. Model homes are open only on the weekends.
Contact: (905) 508-8200 or www.aspenridgehomes.com
Macleod's Landing is one of the last approved developments in Richmond Hill where buyers can get a low-rise home on the edge of the Oak Ridges Moraine.
Having sold more than 1,200 homes there since the development was launched in late 2003, Aspen Ridge Homes - one of three builders in the master-planned community - is about to add another 550 freehold townhouses and detached homes to the site.
Last weekend, 50 townhouses and 120 detached residences on 36-foot lots were unveiled. Larger detached homes on 45- and 50-foot lots will be introduced in upcoming weeks.
The single-family houses on 36-foot lots provide a "good entry into the detached market," Aspen Ridge sales manager Jason Attard says, noting the range of sizes - 1,690 to 2,400 square feet - and the fact that both single- and double-car garages are available.
Named community of the year by the Greater Toronto Home Builders Association (now the Building Industry and Land Development Association) in 2004, the project will eventually include 3,000 homes from Yonge to Bathurst streets and from Jefferson Side Road to King Road.
"Great elevations, great location and you have all your local amenities nearby," Mr. Attard says.
The community's topography includes kettle lakes, ponds and treed areas.
In the development itself, parks, playgrounds, gazebos and walking trails will be added. Nearby outdoor attractions include Sunset Beach on Lake Wilcox, as well as golf courses and equestrian stables.
There also are two schools - with a third to follow - within the community.
Restaurants and shopping malls are nearby, and a commercial centre with a grocery store is planned for a site at Yonge and Stouffville Road.
Highways 400 and 404, GO Transit and York Region Transit are accessible from the site.
"It's probably one of the most desirable locations in York region, if not the Greater Toronto Area," Mr. Attard says of the site, which is named for Scottish soldier Captain Martin Donald Macleod, who built an estate there in 1846 after being awarded 600 acres of Crown land upon his retirement.
Homes will have exteriors of traditional brick or a combination of stone, stucco and brick. Light will flood the interiors through large windows. Nine-foot ceilings on the main floor, vinyl low-E casement windows, natural finish oak veneer stairs, as well as imported ceramic tile and oak hardwood flooring are among the features.
One of the three model homes on site is a 2,336-square-foot plan. The two-storey design includes four bedrooms, three bathrooms, formal living and dining rooms and an eat-in kitchen facing a family room with a gas fireplace.

Library made the hub of an 'impossible house'

Author: Leblanc, Dave

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/library-made-hub-impossible-house/docview/382784070/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: The home has a real freedom of "flow" now, Ms. [Elizabeth Fowler] says, and all of its seemingly incongruous spaces have been sewn together like odd pieces of cloth on a crazy quilt. "This impossible house," says Ms. [German] simply. "Nobody would have designed a house like this."

Full text: Kiloran German and Elizabeth Fowler, collectors of Virginia Woolf first editions, spent 14 years restoring their Port Hope Georgian
Crazy little fox. Half sticking out of the hedge separating the tennis court from the pool, if he were any more relaxed, he'd be wearing his best whites and holding a Head Flexpoint Radical. Stirred by the sound of a homeowner at the barbecue, he looks up, decides there is no threat, and closes his eyes again.
In the early 1990s, had you seen how deteriorated and directionless this once-majestic 1843 Georgian home and its 1970 addition had become, you may have closed your eyes, too. Had you been friends with Kiloran German and Elizabeth Fowler and they'd confided to you that they were seriously considering buying the place to use as a summer home, you probably would have called them crazy.
Seeing their creation, "Bloomsbury," 14 years later, you'd no doubt let out a long, low whistle and say: "Crazy like a fox!"
Sitting poolside, the fox within earshot and the long, low whistle of Port Hope's trains in the distance, the ladies talk about their renovation journey, Bloombury's quirky layout, its sometimes scandalous past, and the battle between Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer, currently in its final throes on the television inside.
Burst pipes, dirty shag carpet, a musty closed-in porch (where an airy verandah had been) and a kitchen threatening to slide into the ravine were just some of the things to worry about when they bought the home, power-of-sale, from the bank.
But before addressing all that, they gave their place an identity because, Ms. German says, "We knew the lifestyle we wanted here." And because that lifestyle had much in common with author Virginia Woolf and her gang of aesthetes known as the Bloomsbury Group, the name was obvious.
"They'd be in London doing their thing, but they'd go to their country houses and have friends over and have conversations [about] design and literature and politics and economics," says Ms. German.
The name Bloomsbury also made sense because the home would house the couple's collection of Virginia Woolf first editions (with dust jackets designed by the writer's sister, Vanessa Bell), letters and related tomes.
And speaking of tomes, the home's history has all the makings of a real page-turner. On a characteristically small lot, the original 1843 house was probably built and inhabited by the British military, as the section of Port Hope it's in was a garrison area.
By the turn of the 20th century, the home was owned by Nicholson File Co., which operated a big mill (and was a big employer) on the Ganaraska River - hundreds of used grindstones can be seen shoring up a retaining wall. It's thought that it was during the company's stewardship that the 20 lots to the east that now make up the expansive property were assembled. (This was possible because the street, Baldwin, was never extended past the house.)
The couple was fortunate enough to meet an elderly man who was raised in the house; he lent them paintings from the 1930s depicting the exterior, which they laser-copied.
There were a few minor renovations made to the house during that period, but its history gets fuzzy again in the mid-20th century.
In 1970, however, lawyer Claude Fitzgibbons bought the home and added a great hall - a fantastic room with a 30-foot ceiling of crisscrossing beams and a massive stone fireplace (and a large master bedroom above and games room below). He also added the pool, cabana and tennis court.
Unfortunately, because of some questionable real estate deals, he lost the property and spent time incarcerated in another province. After that, a member of the Bronfman family purchased it, power-of-sale, but a messy divorce caused him to walk away from the mortgage.
After Ms. Kiloran and Ms. Fowler had paid to have burst pipes fixed and the electrical system updated, Belgian architect Claude Liger-Belair - who had done work for the couple in the mid-1980s in Cabbagetown - was handed the problem of how to better marry the old and new sections.
His solution was simple yet brilliant: A windowless dining room smack-dab in the middle of the home was turned into a library with multiple openings - to the 1843 foyer, the garden room with its new veranda, the newly stabilized kitchen (with exquisite Heartland appliances), the 1970 great hall, even the laundry room.
The library is the "hub" of the home now, says Ms. German, a director of the Ontario Heritage Trust, and because it leads to so many places, it's used often.
Circling the walls near the library ceiling is a quote from Woolf's A Room of One's Own , painted by local artist Amy Quinn: "Lock up your libraries if you like; but there is no gate, no lock, no bolt that you can set upon the freedom of my mind."
The home has a real freedom of "flow" now, Ms. Fowler says, and all of its seemingly incongruous spaces have been sewn together like odd pieces of cloth on a crazy quilt. "This impossible house," says Ms. German simply. "Nobody would have designed a house like this."
It's true. Steps from Port Hope's picturesque downtown yet its setting pastoral enough to encourage lazing by furry friends, the home is, impossibly, a heritage-lover's dream, a gardener's delight and a modernist chalet all rolled into one.
Crazier still, the couple has decided to concentrate on travel, and as a result, plan to put Bloomsbury on the market.

IndyMac bank run: A sign of things to come?

Abstract: At its peak, IndyMac shares traded for $50 each: Now they're trading at 9 cents; from $5.4-billion in market capitalization to $10-million (the stock's 12-month return is a loss of 99.671 per cent). That's probably about $10-million more than it's worth, since there likely won't be anything left for the shareholders once FDIC is finished its liquidation, as FDIC is predicted to burn through about 10 per cent of its funds making good on Indy's deposit insurance.

Full text: It was only a few months back that Northern Rock PLC made the headlines after hordes of depositors descended on the failing bank to demand their money. The story made front-page news around the world. Last week, the same thing happened to Pasadena, Calif.-based IndyMac Bancorp, and over the weekend, the U.S. Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) closed IndyMac and turned it over to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC).
IndyMac depositors were lined up to get their money out, too, but that story barely got any coverage outside of local California papers. Markets were more preoccupied with the travails of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae.
That's kind of odd, since it was a substantial flameout. Indy was the second-largest mortgage lender in the United States, and the seventh-largest savings and loan, with $32-billion (U.S.) in assets and $19-billion in deposits - $1-billion uninsured. It was the biggest bank failure in years. Since 2000, according to the FDIC, there have been 32 bank failures in the United States, with IndyMac the fifth one so far in 2008 and bigger than all the other 31 put together.
The FDIC has another 90 to 150 banks on its list of "troubled" lenders, so it seems likely that there will be more banks going under in the months ahead. Somehow that doesn't seem to bode too well for all those predictions of a second-half recovery this year, you know, that mythical V-shaped chart form, dipping quickly into recession only to storm back up into a new boom.
At its peak, IndyMac shares traded for $50 each: Now they're trading at 9 cents; from $5.4-billion in market capitalization to $10-million (the stock's 12-month return is a loss of 99.671 per cent). That's probably about $10-million more than it's worth, since there likely won't be anything left for the shareholders once FDIC is finished its liquidation, as FDIC is predicted to burn through about 10 per cent of its funds making good on Indy's deposit insurance. That, by the way, suggests that the "premiums," the vig that solvent banks have to pay to FDIC for insuring their deposits, will need to rise, and naturally, that cost will ultimately get passed on to U.S. bank customers, just one more brick in the inflation wall.
Last month, I wrote a column about the Texas Ratio (TR) and the Big Banks, and mentioned, by way of comparison with our domestic banks and their picayune single-digit TRs, IndyMac Bancorp, with its 140 per cent TR. A Texas Ratio of 100 per cent or more, you will recall, indicates a bank that is likely to go under.
Interestingly enough, Research Associates of America, a union-funded non-profit in Washington, has compiled a list of 10 more U.S. banks with a Texas Ratio of 100 per cent or more. There were 11, but ANB Financial National Association of Bentonville, Ark., with a TR of 344 per cent (bad loans totalling more than three times assets, yikes) has already failed and was taken over by a Louisiana bank.
Not quite making the Top 10 is Downey Savings and Loan in Newport Beach, Calif., with $13-billion in assets. It's the largest bank with a high Texas Ratio, at 96 per cent. It and all the others on the Top 10 list are covered by FDIC deposit insurance.
Anyway, back to IndyMac. It was the offspring of Countrywide Financial, now itself relegated to the graveyard of forgotten banks, having recently been rescued by Bank of America. Back in 1985, Countrywide Financial started Countrywide Mortgage Investment as a conduit for the "jumbo" loans that were too big to sell to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac - who've got plenty of their own troubles these days, what with holding $6.5-trillion worth of mortgages, many of which they acquired, oddly enough, from outfits like Countrywide. In 1997, Countrywide spun off the company as an independent mortgage acceptance company, hence IndyMac.
Indy made out like a bandit during the Bubble. In 2004, they bought Financial Freedom, adding reverse mortgages to their menu. By the time Indy hit the bridge abutment, half its business was home equity loans. Alas, the trouble with home equity loans is that you have to have some equity, and with house prices down 30 or 35 per cent, borrowers have negative equity and these loans become rather ephemeral assets.
Indy also had lots of Alt-A loans. Alt-A are often large or "jumbo," often 100 per cent loan-to-value mortgages lent to people with high incomes and better than subprime credit scores. You know, like real estate agents in Pasadena making a hundred grand a year and taking out million-dollar mortgages to flip houses. Nothing can go wrong there, right?
Indy also had about 25 per cent of its assets in pay option-ARM (adjustable-rate) mortgages, those dodgy constructs that accounted for an alarmingly large portion of all mortgages issued during the latter part of the bubble.
There's something like half a trillion dollars of these toxic instruments resetting at higher rates in the coming months, suggesting there could be lots more Indys ahead.

Full text: 952 KINGSTON RD.
Penthouse No. 1
Asking price: $649,900
Selling price: $635,000
Taxes: not yet assessed
Days on the market: 46
Listing agent: Paul Johnston, Right At Home Realty Inc.
There's nothing average about this modern, two-bedroom penthouse with den or the five-storey art moderne structure that contains it, agent Paul Johnston says.
"Many long-time... Beach residents came to see the house and were impressed by it, despite the fact it's quite an unusual type of building" for the established neighbourhood filled mostly with traditional, single-family homes, he says.
The more than 2,200-square-foot unit was the first resale in the 26-loft building, whose base is a restored two-storey, 1940s movie theatre. The suites are contained in a three-storey addition above it.
At the top of the building is this loft's private, 1,000-square-foot terrace with views over mature trees.
"Most terraces are 80 and 100 square feet in condos, so to have the use of half of the building's roof is pretty rare," Mr. Johnston says. "It's like you're sitting above this massive garden, and then you can see the lake beyond."
Another highlight is the bank of curved, floor-to-ceiling windows in the living and dining area, which features a gas fireplace, exposed ductwork above polished concrete floors and a walkout to a deck.
"[The windows] really provide an amazing amount of light, and ... really unique views," Mr. Johnston says.
Before construction began, the owner requested that the open kitchen be extended. It features dark wooden cabinets, granite countertops, an island and stainless-steel appliances.
Both bedroom are entered through frosted sliding glass doors. The master suite has a walk-in closet and the larger of the suite's two bathrooms, which includes a square vessel sink, bathtub and shower stall. A laundry area rounds out the unit.
Parking is included, and a monthly fee of $418 covers maintenance.
Local amenities include boutiques, bookstores and organic coffee shops, as well as beaches and waterfront trails.

For a cheaper cottage, ditch the road

Abstract: Water-access cottages tend to attract younger people because of the challenges the properties present, Mr. [Christopher Huddart] notes. "It's a young person's property, so you have to have 'good-knees days' and be handy. You have to know how to do things, how to build things and how to be resourceful."

Full text: Water-access properties are generally cheaper than ones you can park the car in front of. There are other benefits too
You want to own a cottage, but your budget does not match your dream of sitting on a deck overlooking sparking water, the cry of the loon breaking the silence. You could follow George Popper's example and buy a water-access cottage, a more affordable property because you can reach it only by boat.
The Toronto architect bought a large parcel of land on Lover's Lane, an island in the Thousand Islands, renovated one cottage on the property for his own use, subdivided the lot and is now selling another cottage.
What attracted him - besides the lower price - was the lack of roads. "Once you get out of the car and into your boat, all of a sudden you feel free," he says. "It attracts the kind of person who likes tranquillity."
A boat ride may not be everyone's preferred method of getting to the cottage, but for those who are into boating, buying a water-access property can mean significant savings. Christopher Huddart estimates he saved about $150,000 on the 2003 purchase of his cottage on Hungry Island in Six Mile Lake.
"If you want to get into cottaging and have a smaller budget, then a water-access cottage is the way to go," says Mr. Huddart, a real estate broker of record who owns Christopher J. Huddart Ltd. in Coldwater and Six Mile Lake, and handles many such cottages.
The recently released 2008 Recreational Property Report by Royal LePage Real Estate Services Ltd. found some significant price differences between waterfront cottages with road access and those without. The survey was done in early June.
The Rideau Lake area reported the least-expensive water-access cottages, with a price range of $100,000 to $200,000. Properties reached by road in the same area go for $200,000 to $300,00.
Some of the most expensive water-access cottages are in the Midland/Penetanguishine area, where prices are between $275,000 and $650,000. Road-access cottages in the area run from $375,000 to $1-million.
Some water-access gems can be found in the Parry Sound area for less than $200,000, compared with prices of between $200,000 to $400,000 for cottages reached by road.
In the Gananoque/Kingston area, the difference between water- and land-access cottages is relatively small: $170,000 to $200,000, compared with $170,000 to $300,000.
The survey shows that a buyer in the Sudbury area could save $100,000 by buying a water-access cottage.
In the Haliburton Highlands, such properties range from $130, 000 to $300,000, while cottages reached by land go for between $200,000 and $800,000.
A road-access cottage in the West Kawarthas sells for $240,000 to $2.5-million, compared with $185,000 to $425,000 for one reached by boat.
Given that a standard waterfront, land-access cottage in Ontario went for between $311,826 and $621,174 last year, properties reached by water can be very attractive, especially for first-time buyers, says Pauline Aunger of Royal LePage Pauline Aunger Real Estate in Smith Falls.
Some people request a water-access cottage because they have an idealized vision of island life, she notes. "There's a huge romantic vision that comes with having an island. People who have never owned waterfront property often think of an island as being that bit of utopia with lots of privacy."
But most buyers of cottages without road access are driven by price, she says. "For some people, water-access cottages are the perfect entry level."
There are two types of water-access cottages: a single cottage on a small island and one of many cottages on a larger island. A cottage that is the only one on a small island usually sells at a higher price because you are buying an entire island, says Kathy Dimaline, owner of Davis & McLay Real Estate Inc. in the Bruce Peninsula area.
There are other advantages to owning a water-access cottage besides affordability. Property lots on islands tend to be much larger and have more shoreline than those on the mainland. This keeps neighbours further away, thus ensuring privacy.
"Properties on the shores are close to each other. They're lovely, but it's one house next to ... [the] other on the road," says Mr. Popper, who has several dozen neighbours on the island. "The islands are greener, more private and more natural."
Another advantage of cottages reached by water is that property taxes are lower because the absence of a road reduces their market-value assessment. Many owners of waterfront properties with road access have seen their assessments rise sharply in recent years.
"Some people who have had their cottages in the family for years are all of a sudden getting whopping tax bills," Mr. Popper says. "In some extreme cases, they're being forced to sell because of property taxes."
Water-access cottages tend to attract younger people because of the challenges the properties present, Mr. Huddart notes. "It's a young person's property, so you have to have 'good-knees days' and be handy. You have to know how to do things, how to build things and how to be resourceful."
The major inconvenience of water-bound cottages is having to bring all the paraphernalia associated with cottaging over by boat, which often requires numerous trips. This can prove a particular hardship if you need to transport renovation materials.
You also need to buy or rent a boat and know how to operate it. And next year, everyone in Ontario will be required to have a license to operate one. Even then, a cottage may not be accessible over the winter if the lake freezes. Mr. Popper normally cannot reach his cottage between Christmas and March. Mr. Huddart can use his winterized cottage 10 to 11 months a year by trading his boat for a snowmobile, provided the lake is solidly frozen.
With a boat, you need a marina where you can dock it when not at the cottage, and this can prove to be a problem as some developers have snapped up some marinas for waterfront condominiums. To save their boat slips, some cottagers have banded together to buy their local marinas as they come on the market.
Most water-access cottages have hydro, but some rely on generators. There are people who prefer water-bound properties that are off the power grid so they can install windmills or solar panels. In addition, not all water-access cottages have wells or septic tanks. However, composting toilets or electric toilets are good alternatives, says Ms. Dimaline, the real estate agent.
Another disadvantage is that while a water-access cottage is generally a good investment, renting them out can be problematic, says Laura Gustaffson, a real estate agent with Muskoka-based Vacation Time Realty, which specializes in cottage rentals. The market niche is smaller than for cottages with road access because older people, families with very young children and those who are unfamiliar with boats tend to avoid water-access cottages, she says.

Full text: The rural home of scrap merchant S.J. Sherbanuk is inspired by a love of industrial landscapes. His instructions to the designer? 'I don't want a house, I want a shed'
After a two-year search, S.J. Sherbanuk thought he had found his ideal country property high atop the Niagara Escarpment near Collingwood, Ont. He bartered with the owner but couldn't strike a deal. Frustrated after another failed negotiation, he went for a walk.
Across the road, he found a sign blown over by the wind. Mr. Sherbanuk makes his living from scrap metal, so he thinks nothing of scrambling over rough terrain to examine a rusty piece of junk.
He flipped the sign over and saw its message spelled out in block letters: "Build your dream home here."
So ended Mr. Sherbanuk's search for a plot of land where he could combine his love of the outdoors with his uncommon passion for the industrial landscape of steel and nickel mining and tailing ponds.
The property had languished on the market so long that the sign had fallen over and the real estate listing had expired. When Mr. Sherbanuk called the agent listed on the sign, he launched a process that led to his purchase of the 37-acre property.
When it came time to build a shelter, Mr. Sherbanuk turned to James Campbell of Rockside Campbell Design Inc., who had studied architecture at the University of Manitoba and the Helsinki University of Technology in Finland.
"I don't want a house, I want a shed," Mr. Sherbanuk told Mr. Campbell.
Mr. Sherbanuk was not interested in the typical country pastime of restoring a Victorian farmhouse, and Mr. Campbell was equally adamant that he would take on new work only if the project allowed him to design a modernist building.
The two knew they were on the same page when Mr. Campbell arrived at their first meeting with a stack of books and magazines and Mr. Sherbanuk pulled out his file of tear sheets depicting favourite houses.
"They were the same projects," says Mr. Campbell.
Mr. Sherbanuk grew up in Sudbury, where his father worked in the mining industry. He paid his way through university by working in the mines. He came to love the rugged, utilitarian sheds that were common on mine sites.
When he described his early years to Mr. Campbell, he told stories of tagging along to visit his father's friends, when the men would congregate on greasy shop floors, surrounded by tools and equipment.
"This is the kind of thing that informs a lot when people don't think they're informing you," Mr. Campbell says. "A garage or a workshop is often another living room."
Mr. Campbell began to get a sense from Mr. Sherbanuk's stories of just what he found appealing about an urban shack.
At the same time, Mr. Sherbanuk says, the design of the house was not as important to him as the surroundings.
He was there for the skiing, the rock climbing and mountain biking on local trails.
"The house is not so much about the inside as experiencing the site," says Mr. Campbell, who found the location ideal. As he points out, it's a particularly good site, even to a designer who makes a specialty of building on beautiful pieces of countryside.
The land slopes up to a hardwood bush that protects the dwelling to the north while giving way to an expanse of open meadow to the south and leaving the living area exposed to the predominant west wind, he says.
"This site had it all."
His Finnish experience led him to suggest that the house be set right against the bush. "There is a strong tradition [there] of building on the edge of a forest."
Mr. Sherbanuk figures that Mr. Campbell could not have chosen a better location for the building on any of the 37 acres. He has views into the forest from the kitchen, sauna and bathroom, for example, and looks over the meadow from the dining area. The house is set back from the road and the land and trees obscure neighbouring houses.
The two collaborated on a house that Mr. Campbell describes as a large shed, a small shed and a tower. He imagines strangers stumbling across it decades from now and wondering what it was when it was built.
"They might wonder, 'What is this thing? An old factory? A house?' "
In a sense, it's the opposite of the "McMansion," he reckons.
The main living area has a large living and dining room with wall-to-wall windows and doors. At one end, a three-storey wall clad in raw steel looks like the head frame of a mine shaft. Mr. Campbell had Mr. Sherbanuk's passion for rock climbing in mind when he designed the wall with a shallow slope .
Mr. Sherbanuk's art collection includes a large photograph by Edward Burtynsky, purchased years before the Canadian artist gained prominence as an influential documentarian of industry.
"I've always liked the industrial landscape," says Mr. Sherbanuk, who sees beauty in mines and tailing ponds.
For years, Mr. Sherbanuk was a partner in a massive scrap-processing facility next to the steel mills in Hamilton. Now he's a broker of scrap materials.
He still has a love of steel mills. Most of the steel in the house is new, but some materials have been reclaimed. Grease pencil markings remain on the steel beams where they have been cut and numbered.
Wooden floors and the top of a custom-made table were pulled from a former warehouse belonging to the forestry company MacMillan Bloedel.
Throughout, Mr. Sherbanuk wanted an emphasis on clean, unfussy design. The bathroom vanity is fashioned out of an I-beam. The toilet roll holder is a crude hook.
"There were tons and tons of discussions about little things like this - 'what are we going to use to hold the toilet paper?' " Mr. Campbell says. "We designed something and had it made."
As a result, "there's a rawness to it," Mr. Campbell says of the interior.
The men credit builder Leo Van Eyk with handling many of their stranger requests. Mr. Campbell points to the steel plate baseboards and says many builders would have refused to install them. Steel fabricator Albert Endeman created one-of-a-kind pieces of furniture.
The dark interior also allows the exterior to provide much of the drama.
A window in the sauna, for example, allows a view of the forest. The snow-covered trees in winter are fantastic, Mr. Sherbanuk says. "It's like another piece of art."
In the great room, doors open to a concrete patio that hovers above the land and grazes the tops of the wildflowers.
"A view of your own land is a precious thing," says Mr. Campbell.
Mr. Sherbanuk figures that his view of trees and meadows is, in many ways, more beautiful than a vista over the water.
"The beauty of this view is that it changes every season," Mr. Sherbanuk adds.
In the master bedroom, windows are carefully placed to allow the breeze to blow across the bed.
"It's like sleeping in a tent," the owner says.
Upstairs, a gym provides more views of the land through two large windows.
On the south-facing wall, Mr. Campbell put the window down low.
"It doesn't matter where you put the window in a forest - the view is the same."

Full text: Auditor-General says Jordan River decision went against public interest; minister calls findings a 'blistering attack' on public service
Armed with just a wafer-thin sheaf of briefing notes, then-forests minister Rich Coleman signed an order last year effectively improving Western Forest Products' bottom line by about $150-million.
That was a feeble effort to measure whether giving up controls over valuable waterfront timberlands was in the public interest, B.C.'s Auditor-General concluded yesterday.
The contentious decision freed up 28,000 hectares of the struggling forest company's timberlands on southern Vancouver Island for real estate development.
At a news conference yesterday, John Doyle released a 73-page report damning Mr. Coleman's failure to consult with the public and local government, and described the minister's analysis of the potential impacts as flimsy.
"I would have expected to see the documentation that supported the decision to be beyond reproach," Mr. Doyle told reporters. "We found it inadequate."
Mr. Coleman did not return calls yesterday but Pat Bell, the new Forests Minister, rejected the findings and complained bitterly about Mr. Doyle's methodology.
"This is a blistering attack on the public service in British Columbia; it is inappropriate," Mr. Bell said. "It was not intended to be useful; there are no recommendations in here that we can take forward and take as constructive criticism."
In a rare personal attack on an independent officer of the legislature, Mr. Bell went on to accuse Mr. Doyle of being "unprofessional" and "lacking in integrity."
Mr. Doyle, who took up the post last fall, shrugged off the criticism and said it is healthy for there to be tension between the government and its watchdogs.
He maintained that the government was given ample opportunity to respond to a draft report, and noted that Mr. Coleman's office had stated in writing that the minister relied solely on an eight-page briefing note for his decision.
Vicky Husband is an environmentalist representing residents in the coastal communities that oppose the development.
She said the Auditor-General's report is grounds for a reversal of the land-use decision.
"I think it's a vindication of the outrage the public has been feeling. ... We are asking the government to reverse the decision and immediately put a stop to any subdivision by Western Forest Products."
Mr. Bell said he will not have the land put back into provincial forestry management.
Duncan Kerr, chief operating officer for Western Forest Products, said his company is continuing to prepare the properties for sale. The company hasn't disclosed the deal's value but an internal government report estimated the change would give the properties a value of $150-million.
"There is no mechanism to rescind the decision even if the government was so inclined," Mr. Kerr said. "The bell cannot be un-rung."
Mr. Coleman, now the Minister for Housing, did release a statement saying he has asked the Conflict of Interest Commissioner to review his conduct in the affair.
His brother, Stan Coleman, is in middle-management at Western Forest Products. Opposition critics raised the potential conflict a year ago, but Rich Coleman said he only approached the Conflict Commissioner 2½ weeks ago when he learned the Auditor-General was going to issue a separate report on the question.
Mr. Kerr said his company sought to have some of its privately owned lands removed from the tree-farm licence program before Stan Coleman joined the company.
The program has been in place since the 1940s and generally granted forest companies access to timber on public lands in exchange for greater government control on their private timberlands.
Rick Jeffery, president of the Coast Forest Products Association, said that old "social contract" has long gone by the wayside through many regulatory changes. He said Mr. Doyle is wrong to suggest the deal wasn't in public interest.
"His definition of the public interest fails to include a healthy, competitive, world-class forest industry in the province," Mr. Jeffery said in an interview. "People should ask the 3,000 forestry workers [at WFP] who are going to benefit from this."
However, employment by Western Forest Products has shrunk since the deal was sealed. The payroll has dropped from 3,000 to 2,400 direct employees, and about 800 of those workers are currently laid off due to temporary mill curtailments.
In his report, Mr. Doyle said the government should have analyzed whether those workers would be better off if the company were allowed to sell off timberlands.
John Horgan, the NDP MLA representing most of the communities affected, said the government is attacking Mr. Doyle in a bid to distract the public from his findings.
"It's trying to deflect the attention away from a profoundly stupid decision made by a minister who is inconceivably still a minister of the Crown."
Jordan River is a favourite haunt for surfers who oppose the proposed development because they fear it will ruin the atmosphere.

Full text: Today's auditor-general report will determine fate of Jordan River's forests and the lots likely to replace them
Sealed inside the cab of his massive hydraulic driller, Ron Vanderkhove was intent yesterday on making a deep, narrow puncture in solid rock.
"It's a boring job - loud and dirty," he said as he took a short break from drilling holes for explosives.
The main perk is the view. Mr. Vanderkhove's driller was resting on a peak overlooking the Strait of Juan de Fuca, 350 metres below. In every other direction, he could stare out at forested crests and valleys.
Mr. Vanderkhove is working for Western Forest Products, but this assignment has nothing to do with logging. Last year, the company realized some of its timberlands were worth more as real estate. He's now part of a team of forest workers who have turned their talents to laying out future subdivisions.
The proposed developments would put a price on the view but are mired in controversy. Many residents of the surrounding communities along this southern stretch of Vancouver Island's west coast oppose the development of forestry land, fearing it will ruin their rural lifestyle.
A lifelong resident of nearby Sooke, Mr. Vanderkhove scorns the critics. "There's nothing in Jordan River that can't be bulldozed," he said. "We need sustainable growth."
When did the biggest lumber company on the West Coast become a land-management company that just happens to do forestry?
Duncan Kerr, chief operating officer for Western Forest Products, said the shift in thinking came about 18 months ago. Not only is the industry suffering a prolonged downturn, but real-estate values on Vancouver Island have skyrocketed. To top it off, there were running battles over logging in the region between Sooke and Jordan River.
"When we went to market last summer, we had reached the tipping point," he said yesterday. "We were looking at opportunities to raise some funds, and those waterfront properties come to the forefront pretty quickly."
The proposed developments are privately owned by the forest company but were subject to provincial forestry regulations. Last year, at the company's request, the B.C. government withdrew more than 28,000 hectares of forest from its tree-farm licence program.
Today, B.C. Auditor-General John Doyle will release a report on whether the province acted in the public interest when it freed those private lands from Forest Ministry controls.
Maurita Prato, an environmental campaign organizer for the Victoria-based Dogwood Initiative, doesn't expect Mr. Doyle will roll back the decision for Western Forest Products, but she's hopeful he'll discourage similar forestry exclusions.
"These are lands that will be paved over and turned into suburban sprawl," she said. "It's better off managed as public forest land."
Bob Matters of the United Steelworkers, the union representing forest workers on the West Coast, has urged the auditor to look further than just the lands excluded on behalf of Western Forest Products.
He said the company is leading the pack in real-estate development, but it's a disturbing trend.
But the blasting and surveying has continued regardless of the auditor's work. Western Forest Products is preparing the parcels for 319 lots, each roughly four hectares in size. The timberlands, which have been logged since the 1800s, are mostly 60-year-old, second-growth forests.
The parcels have been sold, pending zoning approval, to a Vancouver developer who has a very different vision than what is being mapped out by the forest company. Rather than a few hundred executive homes spread along the coast, Ender Ilkay envisions Jordan River, a surfer haven with a population of about 50, as a self-sustaining community of about 20,000 people.
"Whatever is there has got to have a big enough tax base to sustain itself," he said yesterday. That would leave the neighbouring communities largely untouched, he said.
"It's an incredibly unique area. It's the rainforest meets the rugged sea. ... The only way it will be a success is if you don't ruin that experience in developing it."
Mr. Ilkay isn't concerned about what the Auditor-General may have to say about how the land came to be on the market. His bigger challenge lies in winning zoning approval from the Capital Regional District, the local governing authority.
This spring, the CRD sent a message by creating a new bylaw that would effectively block any kind of mass development in the region. However, landowners have until next April to get any current permits approved before the new rules take effect.

Abstract: In the late morning a local baker would drive into the campground with fresh-baked goods in a beat-up station wagon, a speaker mounted on top, blaring the daily specials.

Full text: The beach was a kid's world of sand, candy, inflatable plastic and water. Then the developers moved in
We took a chance, our first year, and booked a little motel on the lakeshore. It was perfect. My son rose at 6, even on holiday. I made a pot of coffee while he ate breakfast. Then we walked a few steps from the door of our motel room to the beach.
After a quick survey of the sand, we would choose a spot for the chairs and beach umbrella. He would chase ducks, build sandcastles, investigate the lake bottom in the clear, still morning water. Set up on the beach's best real estate, we would wait for the world to wake up. I would read for a while, sip coffee, study the water, consult on sandcastle design, engage in construction.
Then as others slowly filled the beach, a sea of children took control of their kid world of sand, candy, inflatable plastic and water. It was the kind of holiday I remember. It was the kind of holiday I wanted to give my three kids. And it had to involve water.
The swimming area had a dock anchored a few metres offshore. The lake had minnows and frogs. And it was hot. In the heat of the afternoon, we would rent a boat from an old lady and ride out to the middle of the lake for a swim.
We were there for a couple of years, and then someone came in and ripped the motel off its foundations and began to prepare the ground for condos. No problem, we thought. We'll just go to the campground next door and stay in one of their cabins.
Summer, 2004. The feel of our new destination was different but similar. A little cabin in a family campground in a park designed and built by the owner of nearly 35 years.
There was a tepee in the middle. At 7 each night there were videos in the tepee for the kids. A homemade mini-golf course was lined with jig-sawed, painted cartoon characters. Handcrafted by a man who loved his land. The candy store carried items for a single penny.
In the late morning a local baker would drive into the campground with fresh-baked goods in a beat-up station wagon, a speaker mounted on top, blaring the daily specials. The owner of the campground had a car with a speaker stuck on the roof, too, and he would roll slowly through the tents and cabins announcing an activity or the daily plans he'd made.
On his property, kids ran free in hordes. They roved from site to site, collecting bottles and cans to return at the candy store. Early in the evening, the owner would light a beach fire and supply marshmallows and sticks. One night a week was fireworks night and most of the tenants would buy a stick or two and contribute them to a show launched from the beach.
We tried to book a cabin there the following year, but couldn't. The owner had sold his property to a developer. They were putting in condos.
So we moved to a little lakeside motel up the lake. It too had a lovely culture, with a trampoline, a candy store, water and sand. And some time while we were staying at this little rundown motel, it sold. The trampoline, we were informed by the developer, would be shut down soon because of liability issues. The old lady we rented boats from had to move off the beach and was looking to sell her boats. Beachfront was too expensive, she said.
Construction crews ranged up and down the roads. Real estate agents picketed property. Massive concrete footings were dug into the sand. Sounds of saws and straining engines wafted over the water.
One of our last nights, we ate supper on the roof of the pizza-gelato-photofinishing-fireworks-video rental-drug store and went to D Dutchman Dairy for ice cream cones. On the way home I decided to tour our old campground (bad idea).
The gates had been knocked down to allow construction vehicles free access. I drove in. The grounds had been razed. Trees cut down. Tent sites bulldozed. Candy store windows smashed. Along the mini-golf course, the remaining cartoon figures scrutinized a man who seemed to be intoxicated staggering toward them. He set his drink down so he could swing his sledgehammer with both hands. While we watched, he knocked a hole in the candy store wall.
The children leapt into rage, which crested and fell into guttural sorrow. He wasn't bashing a building: He was hammering our holiday. Like a funeral for a friend where someone assaults the corpse.
In four years, the lake utterly transformed. The kitschy motels and campground disappeared, replaced with gated communities and concierges. The old holiday at the lake was grubby, loud and social. The new is clean, quiet and insulated. The old culture let my family live on the lake for $100 a night. I can buy my piece of the new, beginning, as the advertisement declares, in the low 400s.
Bill Bunn lives in Calgary.

Abstract: The Stampede has become a crucial fund-raising event for charities, with more than a little help from the business community. Last year's "wear a pink shirt for breast cancer" campaign was a huge success. This year's biggest charity event was Wednesday's Stampede Roundup at Fort Calgary, where aging rockers Billy Idol and Joan Jett helped raised $200,000 for the Rotary Club's hospice for terminally ill kids.

Full text:   Alberta's cowboy extravaganza, a key schmoozing scene for the business elite, winds up this weekend. Richard Blackwell, Dawn Walton and Norval Scott look at the event's corporate-tinged history
1 Wild West roots
The celebration dates back to 1912, when cowboy and entrepreneur Guy Weadick created a Wild West show to rival those he had seen in the United States. Initially called the "Frontier Days and Cowboy Championship Contest," it soon morphed into the Calgary Stampede. The seed money to finance it came from four wealthy business leaders: brewer A.E. Cross, beef processor Pat Burns and ranchers Archie McLean and George Lane. They contributed about $100,000 to that first event, a king's ransom at the time. The group is commemorated in the Big Four Building, an exhibition hall that houses key Stampede activities.
2 All aboard
Calgary's business community jumps into the event, cowboy-booted feet first. Many people wear cowboy gear even to the most high-powered meetings, and anyone wearing a shirt and tie through downtown risks having their ties snipped off by locals. Practically all energy companies, law firms, real estate agencies and every other kind of business holds some sort of event, ranging from small breakfasts to full-on parties. Particularly popular are those held by the investment boutiques.
3 Wild parties
Pengrowth Management Ltd.'s annual house party at president Jim Kinnear's Mount Royal home last Sunday was one of the most spectacular private events this year, attended by the lucky hundreds who snagged an invite. The street was shut down and neighbours' lawns conscripted for extra space. Jim Cuddy of Blue Rodeo fame played in the backyard, while guests scarfed down free ice cream, food and grog. In the front yard, there was a petting zoo and a stuffed bull named Fred that people could sit on and have their picture taken, then handed to them framed, on the spot. Among those posing: Alberta's former premier Ralph Klein.
4 Charitable events
The Stampede has become a crucial fund-raising event for charities, with more than a little help from the business community. Last year's "wear a pink shirt for breast cancer" campaign was a huge success. This year's biggest charity event was Wednesday's Stampede Roundup at Fort Calgary, where aging rockers Billy Idol and Joan Jett helped raised $200,000 for the Rotary Club's hospice for terminally ill kids. Arcturus Realty Corp. was the main sponsor, helped out by other corporate big shots such as Blakes law firm, Dundee Realty Management Corp., Sleeman Breweries and Direct Energy.
5 Wild horses
Despite complaints from animal rights activists and environmentalists, the chuckwagon races are still a central focus of the Stampede, as they have been since 1923. That first year, the total prize money amounted to $275. Now, they pay out more than $1-million and help businesses wow their guests with lavish infield suites close enough to the track to get dirt kicked up on them.
The races are still dangerous events. Last year, three horses died and one driver was seriously injured, prompting organizers to put in place new rules and hefty fines for negligent drivers. Still, this year, one horse had to be euthanized after an accident in Wednesday's race.

Full text:   Locals will face security lockdowns, heads of state - and a run on souvenirs. The town has two years to get ready
No sooner had the Prime Minister's motorcade turned onto Highway 60 on its way out of town, leaving in its dust news that the sprawling Deerhurst Resort here would host the G8 summit in 2010, than the rumour mill got cranking.
There is talk that the three-day event will bring screaming fighter jets to the skies, a town-wide security lockdown, and runs on the supermarkets. Cottage rental rates will quadruple. Youthful indiscretions will be exposed by invasive background checks. Heads of state will arrive by water planes on Peninsula Lake.
Huntsville, that sleepy playground for the privileged in the heart of Muskoka cottage country, is in a tizzy.
"Everyone who comes in is talking about it," said Wayne Baker, the 54-year-old owner of the Barber Shop on Main Street. "People around here have never seen anything of this magnitude."
Most of the 18,500 residents are proud that their tiny town on the edge of the Canadian Shield won over federal officials, who spent months scouring the country for a venue with the traits befitting the modern G8 - idyllic, secluded, and easy to secure. They also have high hopes that the event will affix Muskoka - already the land of $2-million summer homes and $5-million egos - firmly to the global map.
But the ordinary affluent weekenders who give Huntsville its seasonal crowds and soaring real-estate prices, and the year-rounders who greet their arrival with layered gratitude and tolerance, are responding with varying degrees of enthusiasm.
"It'll be so exciting, even the protesters," said Sandra Rae, a retiree from Mississauga who used to run a resort with her husband on Oxtongue Lake. "A bear walking through the woods is the most exciting thing we usually see around here."
"People think economically it will be a positive thing," said Anne Smith, 57, owner of the Bookcase bookstore in downtown Huntsville, on a strip no longer than a kilometre.
Not all business owners are anticipating a windfall, though. Tom Walsh, whose Huntsville Marine and Recreation sits on Highway 60 a few kilometres from the Deerhurst Resort, fears security measures on the highway and in the surrounding lakes will hamper his business. "I think it will be a wash for us," said Mr. Walsh, who rents up to 20 boats daily for as much as $300 apiece. "The question for us is where [government security is] going to restrict movement."
And some are planning to grab the kids, close the shutters, and batten down the hatches. "We're looking at high security [in the area]," said Geordie Heath, 30, a paramedic with three small children. "It's not something the kids need to be exposed to. It's more of a burden than anything."
THE PROTEST FACTOR
Images of thousands of protesters clashing with police officers in riot gear at the 2001 Summit of the Americas in Quebec City, where 400 people were arrested and 300 police officers were injured, are fuelling anxiety in Huntsville. That same year, police shot and killed a protester at the G8 summit in the Italian port city of Genoa.
"It's not the meeting that's a concern," said Alex Kudryk, 57, a retired OPP officer who secured Huntsville for triathlons and other athletic events. "It's the people who follow it around and its reputation for violence that are a concern."
While violence has been virtually absent at the G8 since 2002 due to enhanced security and the isolation of the conference venues, the concern is still valid.
"You have interest groups from all over descending on your community, scoping it out, a year or two in advance," says Gillian Brown-Dettmer, an auditor at the Huntsville Comfort Inn, who, as the former marketing director for an association of exclusive golf courses, witnessed preparations for the 2005 G8 at the Gleneagles Hotel in Scotland.
"It's going to be a great opportunity for this community, but the people have no idea what's coming."
Huntsville Mayor Claude Doughty said in an interview that he has not been briefed by the federal government on security, noting that a date has not even been set for the summit. At the same time, he acknowledged hearing that federal officials are reticent to limit air travel over Toronto and said scuttlebutt about a two-km lockdown around Deerhurst "makes sense."
"There won't be any rocket launchers on Fairy Lake," said Mr. Doughty, who lives on the lake that abuts Huntsville and is lobbying for a June summit to offset the high tourist season in July and August.
There are also worries about whether infrastructure, from roads to hospitals to jails, can handle the 5,000 journalists, several thousand protesters, and tens of thousands of political and security aides that are standard G8 baggage. There are plans to upgrade roads and hospital facilities, and discussions are under way to add bus and train service to reduce traffic congestion.
Conference boosters have attempted to assuage the angst by noting that Huntsville comfortably absorbs five times its population during the summer months and routinely hosts large athletic events. Mr. Doughty noted the town is home to the annual Canadian Pond Hockey Championships and is holding an Ironman competition in September that is expected to draw 1,500 athletes. "It's not an equal comparison, but those things demonstrate our ability to handle large-scale events," Mr. Doughty said.
CAPITALIZING ON G8
History suggests the economic impact of the conference will be significant. The 2002 conference reportedly pumped some $300-million into Kananaskis, Alta. It came with a price, however. Security reportedly cost taxpayers in excess of $200-million.
One industry speculating about a financial boon from the conference is real estate. Agents are speculating that upscale cottages that rent for between $5,000 and $10,000 a week could fetch as much as $25,000. Several brokers in town reported fielding inquiries from cottage owners looking to capitalize by renting their properties to deep-pocketed dignitaries.
Sheila Givens, whose Cottages on the Web specializes in private rentals, got her first of several calls within hours of news breaking about the summit. One caller, an owner of a five-bedroom waterfront cottage on Bella Lake that Ms. Givens estimated would normally rent for between $5,000 and $6,000 a week, was seeking $10,000 the week of the summit.
"It's going to wake up the world to Muskoka," Ms. Givens said. "There is going to be increased demand from there on, I would think."
Sue Burke, a sales agent with Royal LePage Lakes of Muskoka, said she heard from the owner of an opulent cottage on Lake of Bays who does not rent and is contemplating asking for $25,000.
"The people who own those places don't need the money that badly, so if they're going to rent they want to make it worth their while," Ms. Burke said. "We're all just speculating right now."
Deerhurst boasts accommodations for 1,000 people in 400 rooms and suites, many of which are privately owned or blocked by timeshares. Rates for suites overlooking Peninsula Lake can exceed $650 a night.
"I would really hope that Deerhurst would give us some sort of alternative," if the summit forces them out, said Erin Metcalf, 30, whose family has had a timeshare during the first week of July for 19 years. "Otherwise it's just a lottery of who loses out."
Deerhurst spokeswoman Anne White (no relation to the bookstore owner) said it's too soon for such conversations to take place. "Obviously that's something that has to be addressed once the government of Canada confirms the dates," Ms. White said.
Simon Bevan, president of the Huntsville-Lake of Bays Chamber of Commerce, believes the summit will "put Muskoka on the map." But such optimism has drawn skepticism from some residents.
"Everybody is on the bandwagon," said Harry Wahl, 74, who questioned the long-term benefits of the event in a recent letter to the editor of The Huntsville Forester. In it, he challenged readers to recall the locations of the last four G8 Summits. The answer: Heiligendamm, Germany (2007); Strelna, Russia (2006); Auchterarder, Scotland, (2005), and, in the U.S., Sea Island, Ga. (2004). "The focus will not be on Muskoka," Mr. Wahl said. "The focus will be on the political leaders and the activists. I think we will lose out in the end."
Others, like John Hertell, 67, who makes his living selling hot dogs and pop outside the town hall, are taking a wait-and-see approach.
"They say there's going to be a lot of economic spinoff but I don't know," Mr. Hertell said, then paused. "Unless I have Obama burgers or something like that."
Regional runways
Deerhurst Airstrip
A private, 3,000-foot executive airstrip located on the Deerhurst Resort property. It can accommodate small aircraft (up to a Dash 7), float planes and helicopters.
Muskoka Airport
Located 45 kilometres away in Gravenhurst. The airport has one 6,000-foot asphalt runway and a secondary, smaller grass runway.

Location, location
In his announcement, Prime Minister Stephen Harper waxed poetic about the region's "uniquely Canadian beauty," saying it would be an ideal place for the leaders of France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada and Russia to meet, as they did this week in Hokkaido, Japan. But Deerhurst Resort also possesses qualities similar to every summit location since the last hosted by Canada in 2002 in Kananaskis, Alta., which set the standard for post-9/11 Group of Eight confabs.
Bound by water to the east and south, the 316-hectare resort is only accessible by two main roads, simplifying security. Its private airstrip and proximity to Muskoka Airport may also preclude restricting airspace around Toronto, 225 kilometres away.
In Kananaskis, where the government imposed a 500-km-radius no-fly zone over the village and closed the only road into town, most protesters did not even bother trying to scale the 2,600-metre jagged peaks engulfing the leaders. They instead resorted to venting their subdued rage 50 km away in Calgary, where shop owners had boarded up their stores in preparation for violent demonstrations that never materialized. The number of demonstrators reportedly peaked at 3,000 - about a fifth of what protest organizers had projected.
At the meeting in Kananaskis, just 10 months after the Sept. 11 attacks in New York, CF-18 fighters and ground-to-air missiles were reportedly at the ready to respond to violators of the restricted airspace. Roughly 4,500 police officers and 6,000 soldiers were deployed to protect the leaders and secure a 25-km perimeter around the mountain village.
On the Japanese island of Hokkaido, where the G8 just wrapped up, police outnumbered protesters. The largest rally consisted of 3,000 demonstrators and occurred in a city an hour north of the lakeside summit site.
According to the National Police Agency, Japan mobilized 21,000 police officers and spent about $280-million to essentially lock down a portion of the island. Armed cruisers were stationed offshore.

Full text:   A Toronto couple mend their crushed island cottage
They had called their Georgina Island cottage their "tropical island." It was where Calvin Liu and Mark Oliver retreated every summer to leave the worries of the city behind. But then the ice hit, destroying their lakeside idyll - and all thoughts of escape.
It happened one night in April, and with startling speed, according to neighbour Bill Linders, who with his wife, Charlotte, witnessed the destruction from the safety of their home next door.
"The wind started at five minutes after 12 ... and at 25 minutes after 12 it was all done," says Mr. Linders, who watched in amazement as the ice on Lake Simcoe destroyed the men's cottage with glacial force. "It was all over in 20 minutes."
The ice was more than a foot thick, and by Mr. Linder's estimation, at least 22 kilometres wide, the distance separating Georgina Island from the city of Barrie, located directly across the lake.
"It sounded like a bulldozer - crushing and crashing and tearing the cottage apart."
Mr. Linder says that the ice pushed the cottage, which was located just six feet from shore, completely off its footings. "[The ice] came in through one wall and went out through the back wall, completely destroying it." (The Linders' home is set back from the water and remained intact.)
The neighbour telephoned Mr. Oliver in Toronto, where he works as a venture capitalist, to give him the news. Mr. Liu, a family practice physician, says he nearly collapsed from the shock.
"We went up to look at the damage, and we both couldn't believe our eyes," Mr. Liu says. "It was so shocking, it made the front page of the local newspaper [the Pefferlaw Post]."
The article was accompanied by a photograph of the cottage, which had been featured in several interior design publications, including Canadian House and Home and Globe Real Estate. All that remained was the roof line, sagging into a chunk of ice as tall as a two-storey building.
Making matters worse, the house wasn't insured against damage from ice.
"Buried deep in our policy was an exclusion clause that means flooding or ice - water-borne objects - are not covered," Mr. Oliver says. "We seriously thought about demolishing what was left and selling the land, just to try to ease the pain."
Several contractors they consulted were of a similar opinion. Each in turn took one look at the cottage and declared it a teardown.
"We went into action to clear out what we could salvage, although the blocks of ice were ceiling high," Mr. Oliver says. "The roof was actually resting on the ice, which had taken out most of the interior walls."
A chandelier dangled incongruously above the debris, a remnant of the cottage that was.
"My moment came when we were taking things out of the cottage to move to safety," Mr. Oliver says. "Seeing the objects and the boxes out on the deck made me remember moving things in only four years ago, and how exciting and positive that was. Our first cottage experience. And then it felt like a closure to all that. The end of it. I was very sad."
But then they met David Beaudreau, a local builder who was introduced to them by their long-time contractor, Wayne Hoag.
The two cottage owners now call Mr. Beaudreau a miracle worker.
"[He] took a look and ... with confidence, said that he and his boys could save the structure and move it back so it would be out of harm's way in future," Mr. Oliver says. "Calvin and I were a little skeptical, but he offered some hope. As it turned out, he really performed miracles with the structure, and we ... had it moved back 40 feet onto a new foundation."
That involved putting the cottage on rollers, but only after men from around the island went into the building and - with their bare hands - removed the chunks of ice.
The cottage had become a cause celèbre, with everyone lending a hand. Says Mr. Oliver, "When was the last time contractors were lining up to get to your job?"
Out of destruction came a renewed sense of community.
Mr. Hoag returned early from his vacation and worked every day of the recent long weekend until 8 p.m. to dig a new water line, connect the septic tank, prime the pump and hook up the plumbing so that they would have bathroom facilities, Mr. Oliver says.
He, meanwhile, had already primed and painted everything white - the colour of new beginnings.
On the long weekend, the two men and several friends travelled to the cottage to continue its refurbishing and move in some belongings.
"Looking at the barren spot where the cottage used to sit brought back memories," Mr. Oliver says, "but looking back to where the new cottage sits, lit this weekend with lanterns, made the "[photographer Edward] Burtynsky" landscape in between the old and the new seem very magical. It was our first 'sleep over,' and a moment even more poignant than the original move-in four years ago."
Last Sunday morning, he adds, friends Christine Ralphs, the well-known Toronto interior designer, and her husband, Peter, "magically appeared" by boat from their cottage on neighbouring Snake Island. They helped move salvaged belongings back into the cottage from storage in Mr. Linder's garage.
Mr. Liu is now so suffused with hope that he has started hunting the local Goodwill stores and flea markets for those one-of-a-kind finds that will restore his summer home to its former shabby-chic splendour.
It's still going to be several weeks before the cottage is livable. In the meantime, Mr. Oliver and Mr. Liu are realizing what they have gained from the whole experience.
"Our new place will be more beautiful than the last, and full of new meaning that never could have been there in the beginning," Mr. Oliver says.

Full text:   Market Wharf
Location: St. Lawrence Market
Builder/developer: Context
Size: 422 to more than 2,000 square feet
Price: low $200,000s to more than $1-million
Sales centre: 1 Market St., southwest of The Esplanade and Jarvis Street. Open Monday to Thursday, noon to 6 p.m.; weekends, noon to 5 p.m.
Contact: (416) 861-8181 or www.marketwharf.com
With more than 2,000 people registered for last weekend's preview of Market Wharf - a new condominium by Context in the St. Lawrence Market neighbourhood - it took only a few days for half of the suites to be sold.
Situated just south of the historic market building, the 32-storey condo will consist of 450 units measuring from 422 and to more than 2,000 square feet. It will open to the general public tomorrow.
"It's really one of the last great sites in the St. Lawrence Market neighbourhood," says Craig Taylor, director of marketing for Context. "It's not every day that you can buy a brand new home here."
The contemporary residence will be steps from the fresh-food market, shops, galleries, cafes, spas and restaurants on The Esplanade, and King and Queen streets. The Sony Centre, Air Canada Centre and Rogers Centre are also nearby. And residents will be within easy reach of the lakeshore and Martin Goodman Trail.
Peter Clewes of architectsAlliance created a building that pays tribute to local history. The lake once came up to where The Esplanade is, and by the 1830s, there were many wharves and piers along that stretch of shore. So, the Market Wharf building will feature shapes and lines reminiscent of water and waves: undulating walls, ceilings and balcony sides (in upper-floor units). The south and north lobbies will contain curved sofas.
There will be a 10,000-square-foot recreational centre for residents, complete with a yoga room, gym, media and conference rooms, outdoor terraces and a party room. An 18,000-square-foot Shoppers Drug Mart will also be located in the building.
A good selection of units remains: studios; one- and two-bedroom suites, with or without dens; and three- or four-bedroom homes.
"Every suite remaining ... has views of the city and the lake," Mr. Taylor notes.
Along the top levels of the eight-storey podium, there will be two-storey units. "They're like townhomes in the sky with their own backyard," Mr. Taylor says.
Standard features in all suites include nine-foot ceilings, quartz countertops; ensuite bathrooms with floor-to-ceiling, tiled walls; and Paris kitchens with full-height cabinetry, porcelain-tiled backsplashes and stainless-steel appliances.
"We're trying to think of other options that people can't necessarily get on the market that easily," Mr. Taylor explains.
Penthouses will have more luxury appointments, including Sub-Zero, Miele and Wolf appliances.
There will be Energy Star appliances in all suites, and two- and three-bedroom units will have master light switches at the front door. In addition, hydro will be individually metered.
The building itself will have green roofs to keep it cooler and to reduce storm water runoff.
There will be separate chutes for waste, recycling and organic materials, as well as a car-sharing service.
Parking in the above-grade garage will cost $29,500, and a locker $3,500.
The monthly maintenance fee will be 47 cents a square foot.
Occupancies are scheduled to begin in the spring of 2011.

Full text:   61 SINGLETON RD.
Asking price: $345,000
Selling price: $335,000
Taxes: $2,328 (2007)
Lot size: 42 by 125 feet
Days on the market: 35
Listing agent: Mary Nikles, Re/Max Hallmark Realty Ltd.
This 1½-storey house spent a little over a month on the market and sold for $10,000 less than the asking price, which is a typical scenario for similar properties in the Wexford-Maryvale neighbourhoods, agent Mary Nikles explains.
The home's most attractive feature is its quiet, secluded locale backing on to Wexford Park.
"[The park is] very heavily wooded, so you feel like you're in the countryside, and you don't see any houses in the backyard," the agent says.
Another advantage of the property is its detached garage, whose walls are constructed of two layers of brick, making it a more sturdy structure than many of those at older bungalows in areas such as East York and Leaside.
"It's an usual feature on that particular street," Ms. Nikles notes. "Most of the parking there is in carports, not full garages, and certainly not double-brick [garages]."
The seller - and original owner - of the house, built in 1954, replaced some windows as well as the furnace, and updated the plumbing and air-conditioning systems.
Carpeting was removed throughout and the hardwood flooring underneath was refinished. There is a combined living and dining room, an eat-in kitchen, a bedroom and a four-piece bathroom located on the main level.
The upper level houses a second bedroom and a master suite with a walk-in closet and private powder room with roughed-in plumbing for a shower.
The basement is finished with a recreation room and laundry room.
Local amenities include public transit, shops and schools.

Full text:   There's no beach, but Main Street pulses with an urban vibe absent from many other Vancouver locales
Of all the streets in Vancouver, none draws young hipsters and heritage home-seeking yuppies like Main Street.
At one time, it was a neglected and rundown east-side neighbourhood. Today, it has become the place to buy.
"The rate of appreciation in this neighbourhood is faster than any other neighbourhood. It's unbelievable," says real estate agent Jennifer Hill, who has been selling houses in the area for 15 years.
"You could say it was undervalued, considering its proximity to downtown. And then, it just took off."
Depending on condition and lot size, the average cost for a family home is in the $700,000 range, says Ms. Hill. "And we're now seeing prices over $1-million. I remember when we were floored, not so long ago, when a house sold for $500,000."
In the past five years, the area known as Main Street, which extends roughly from Main and East 6th Avenue to East 30th Avenue, has become one of the most desirable neighbourhoods in Vancouver.
The success factor for Main Street is, quite simply, that it is not Kitsilano.
Main Street is central and diverse, and a slice of urban living in a city better known for its yoga-loving citizens.
In the same corridor, mixed among small clothing stores that sell local designers, independent coffee shops and trendy restaurants such as Habit, Aurora Bistro and Cascade, you'll find long-time antique shops and Chinese and Korean restaurants. Because the area lacks the chaotic, club-going gregariousness of downtown's Granville Street, it attracts the young and creative, indie-loving crowd.
"It's definitely the darling of the indie set," says Frances Bula, a well-known Vancouver city writer and blogger who lives in the area.
Not surprisingly, the Main Street condo market is flourishing. For a one-bedroom in the less-expensive end of Main, north of Broadway, prices range from $250,000 to $320,000. Heading south on Main toward East 15th, a buyer is looking at $300,000 to $450,000 for a one- or two-bedroom.
It wasn't always this way. In the 1980s, Main Street was better known for problems with prostitution than for fashionable shops and eateries. The prostitutes were long gone by the '90s, but the perception of the area as being more hip than troubled has changed only in the past few years.
"The prime example is a family who bought a little house that needed tons of work five years ago," says Ms. Hill. "They put a lot of sweat equity into it, but they needed a bigger house. They sold it for three times what they paid for it. And they stayed in the neighbourhood, so that's a good testimonial."
Part of Main Street's appeal is the fact that it's more diverse than expensive west-side neighbourhoods, such as Kitsilano or Kerrisdale. On Main Street you can just as easily find a cheap diner meal as you can dine at a hot new bistro, such as newcomer Burgoo, which already has a location in tony Point Grey.
As well, Main Street has become a pedestrian-friendly street, a key factor for a desirable neighbourhood.
"When I first started there was no character in the neighbourhood," says Ms. Hill. "There wasn't the little cafes, the restaurants, the independent stores, the clothing stores, anything like that - nothing to support pedestrian traffic. Now it's really pedestrian-oriented.
"The neighbourhood is more organic than, say, Kitsilano," she adds. "That's the best word I can use. The stores are independent, they're really creative, it's got way more texture, it's way earthier."
Larry Beasley, retired director of planning for the city, remembers being involved in planning Main Street's revitalization 30 years ago. He was part of a neighbourhood improvement program involving all three levels of government in the late 1970s and early '80s. The program made small loans available to people to upgrade their homes and worked with merchants on a viable antiques and second-hand furniture market. The project took off, and Main Street has long been known as the place to go for antiques.
Mr. Beasley also helped develop a neighbourhood community house to help meet residents' needs.
"It was pretty rough," he says of the old neighbourhood. "But it was populated by a community of wonderful people who were just trying to cope the best they could under the circumstances, with very old housing."
As for the neighbourhood becoming a sudden draw for people who might otherwise buy in Kits, Mr. Beasley sees it as indicative as an overall demand on Vancouver's inner-city neighbourhoods.
"It has to do with the overwhelming price rise that's happening throughout Vancouver," he says. "Since these neighbourhoods stabilized in the '80s they became very attractive alternatives ... And the schools remained quite good and with all services there and the parks upgraded, it became more attractive."
Antiques retailer Mary Jarvis has been working in the area since 1965. She has seen Main Street go through good times and bad."It's much more upmarket now - they used to be shacks," she says of the housing supply. " But now there are some lovely houses, painted up; gardens have been done. People take pride in their houses. It's a very eclectic mix of people."
She believes the demands on Main Street will only grow with the arrival of the 2010 Winter Olympics.
"We're all feeling it's going to change hugely because we're bracketed by the Olympics," she says. "The [athletes'] village is at the foot of Main and the curling rink is at 33rd Avenue, so this is going to be the street that is going to benefit most, as far as we can tell."
Both Ms. Hill and Mr. Beasley are aware that with increased property prices comes gentrification, which may change the area's atmosphere of diversity.
"It's inevitable that it would push some people out of the neighbourhood, and that's very sad," says Mr. Beasley. "The city and province have to start thinking about different strategies to secure middle-affordable housing in the city "We didn't have to worry about this five years ago, but we've seen dramatic increases throughout the city."
Other inner city neighbourhoods - such as Strathcona, Fraser Street, Grandview-Woodlands and Mount Pleasant further north - are undergoing revivals as well.
"That is indicative of a trend that is larger than any of these neighbourhoods," Mr. Beasley notes. "It's a trend of housing-price escalation throughout the inner city. We aren't like other cities. Often cities have very negative 'doughnuts' around the inner city: it will be a core business centre, then pretty negative neighbourhoods around that, before you get to the suburbs.
"But we forestalled that because we had active planning ongoing throughout the years ... throughout the inner city, we have created some pleasant neighbourhoods. ...Community action is quite high."

Full text:   The cleanup of a nearly derelict shop and upstairs apartment on a busy Vancouver street has yielded an unusual find: more than $400,000 in cash, some of it in notes dating back to the 1930s, stuffed into various hiding places.
The Lido, nominally a deli and convenience store on East Broadway in the city's Mount Pleasant neighbourhood, has long been something of a local mystery.
For several years it has rarely, if ever, been open, and passersby often noticed old canned food and electronics sitting undisturbed on dusty shelves.
But cleanup crews hired by the family of its former proprietor, Margaret Rothweiler, who died earlier this year, got a hint of a surprising past when they spotted $950 in almost 80-year-old bills hidden between two carpets.
It turned out that the find was in addition to a much larger stash of $400,000 a caretaker discovered in a closet.
The caretaker returned the money to Ms. Rothweiler's family just before 1-800-Got-Junk arrived to clean up.
Craig Sexton, the company's general manager and part of the crew that found the smaller amount, called the Lido job "No. 1 or 2" among his strangest assignments yet.
In addition to the cash, his team turned up decades-old German passports, mildewed clothing and enough rotting, canned salmon to fill two trucks - an amount Mr. Sexton called "disturbingly large."
Both packages of cash were given back to Ms. Rothweiler's heirs, who could not be reached for comment.
A nephew who acknowledged he had not seen her in years suggested the money had come from neighbourhood real estate investments and successful betting on horses by Ms. Rothweiler and her late husband, Chris.
Since her death, the Lido and its upstairs apartment have been sold and extensively renovated.
Although the building's new owners are not yet sure of their plans for the space, they will almost certainly not include hidden cash or rotting salmon - unlike the closed shop that had Vancouver pedestrians scratching their heads for years.

Full text:   OAK BAY BEACH HOTEL
Developer: Walker Hospitality
Price: Starting at $1,000,000
Size: 857 sq. ft. to 2,285 sq. ft.
Sales centre: 1111 Warf Street, Victoria
Contact: Phone 1-800-668-7758 or visit www.oakbaybeachhotel.com
In 2010 Vancouver will host the Winter Olympics and Victoria will celebrate another memorable event - the reopening of the Oak Bay Beach Hotel.
Walker Hospitality last week opened registration to buyers interested in the 20 full-ownership suites that will be part of the 100-room hotel, which will open in the fall of 2010.
At that time, the Oak Bay Beach Hotel will become Victoria's first combined luxury hotel and private residence.
Owners Kevin and Shawna Walker, who shared duties as hoteliers at the original Oak Bay Beach Hotel for three decades, aim to satisfy both nostalgia and modern expectations.
"Recreating the hotel gives us the opportunity to combine the charm from the past with the amenities and upscale interior design available to us today," Mr. Walker says.
The Walkers plan to restore the hotel's 80-year-old legacy by recreating original elements such as the lobby fireplace, Tudor facade and even the original Snug Pub beer mug, while introducing modern interior updates and aiming for a LEED Gold certification.
Brad Neufeld, director of sales for the project, anticipates a lot of local interest because of the history involved.
"People who grew up in Victoria and Oak Bay with the original Oak Bay Beach Hotel understand its significant role in the community as an iconic property," he says. "To be able to invest in a home here, and live in the hotel full-time with all the amenities and luxuries that offers, is a dream come true for many people."
Buyers will have full access to the hotel's spa, mineral pools, restaurant and seaside pub to go along with their private home on the development's coveted oceanfront location.
All the residential suites are penthouse and sub-penthouse units with views of the Pacific and the San Juan Islands.
"People are thrilled to see the Oak Bay Beach Hotel being rebuilt and brought back into their community," says Shayne Jessop, director of sales and marketing. "The location has such a rich history and is undoubtedly one of the nicest and rarest pieces of waterfront property in Western Canada," he says.
"I am not going to be surprised if we sell some homes to people who grew up with the original Oak Bay Beach Hotel as a part of their lives, and who want to recapture a piece of history that is being rebuilt to a level that positions it as one of the finest buildings in the area."
The hotel aims to continue its original philosophy of providing highly attentive personal service. Homeowners will have use of the hotel's round-the-clock butler and room service, on-site adventure programs, in-room chef, and fitness facility.
"You can have it any way your want," Mr. Walker says. "You can be left completely alone or you can feel like a pampered hotel guest every day of the year."

Seniors struggling to shop for a decent meal

Full text:   In one of Vancouver's swankiest neighbourhoods, some retirees don't eat properly because of poor access to healthy food
Pauline Waddington, 73, lives in one of the most coveted areas in Vancouver. Her small studio apartment is steps away from Jericho Beach and within walking distance of swanky boutiques, chic restaurants, trendy cafes and multi-million dollar mansions.
But despite the offerings of her tony West Point Grey neighbourhood, Ms. Waddington, struggles to get a decent meal.
"I have emphysema and I also have osteoarthritis ... so I can't carry groceries any more," she said. "And the cost of groceries - what can we do about that, really? Things are expensive."
Ms. Waddington's diet consists mostly of cheap frozen food and ready-made soups, which she pays a neighbour $5 a week to drive her to the supermarket to buy.
In Vancouver's affluent Westside, seniors like Ms. Waddington are not getting enough nutritious food, social service agencies say. Housing costs in the area are skyrocketing and supermarkets in certain parts of the Westside are few. So, while younger residents can walk or drive to do their grocery shopping, some seniors wind up filling up on inexpensive, unhealthy food from their nearest convenience store.
Issues of mobility, income and pride prevent many of them from maintaining healthy diets.
"A lot of our clients, with their limited income, will go for convenience like Kraft Dinner," said Lisa Ross, director of basic resources for the Jewish Family Service Agency, which provides support for area seniors. "Is it the most nutritious? No, but it might be cheaper."
While some seniors in the Westside rely on government-subsidized housing, others are house-rich but cash-poor, and can't afford to keep up with the rest of the neighbourhood, said Ms. Ross, who also co-chairs the Westside Food Security Collaborative, a coalition of social-service agencies and residents formed last year to address the community's food needs.
Many Westside seniors own their own property and paid off their mortgage years ago, when real-estate values weren't so high, she said.
"So, they sit and live here in their community, but that doesn't mean they have the income to sustain it."
The needs of seniors in the area are often overlooked because they are more reluctant to admit they need help than those in less affluent parts of the city, Ms. Ross said.
"It's almost a shame thing," she said.
Yet with real-estate values continuing to rise, it has becoming an ever more expensive place to live. The value of a typical two-bedroom Westside apartment rose to $407,000 in 2007, up 16 per cent from the previous year, while the value of a typical single-family home in the area jumped 22 per cent to more than $1-million, the B.C. Assessment agency reported in January.
Meanwhile, the average renter is hard pressed to find an apartment in the area for less than $900 a month. Roger Palmer, 69, who lives in a government-subsidized apartment in West Point Grey, said nearly half his $1,000 monthly pension goes to rent.
"The rest is spent on food," he said, estimating he spends about $140 a week on groceries for himself and his dog, Tassle, whom he considers his closest companion. His bank account is often in overdraft at the end of the month. Although Mr. Palmer's income might stretch further in a less expensive part of town, he is reluctant to leave a neighbourhood in which he's lived for 20 years.
"I just love it here," he said.
Affordability aside, many seniors in the Westside have access problems preventing them from getting nutritious food, either because it's too far to walk to the nearest grocery store, or they find public transportation inconvenient, said Catherine Leach, executive director of the non-profit Kitsilano Neighbourhood House.
"They may have money to purchase food, but getting there to get the food is an issue," she said. Many find taxis too expensive, and the HandyDART public transportation service for people with disabilities is erratic, Ms. Leach said.
That has some seniors relying on convenience stores to tide them over between trips to the supermarket. Small, neighbourhood produce stores are abundant and offer cheap, fresh fruits and vegetables. But some seniors can't manoeuvre their scooters, wheelchairs and walkers through their narrow aisles, said staff at Vancouver Coastal Health's Pacific Spirit Community Health Centre, which serves the Westside.
The Westside Food Security Collaborative and Vancouver Coastal Health did not have statistics on the number of seniors unable to obtain nutritious food. But they noted that as the population ages, there is a greater need for more food-delivery services and better transportation in the area.
Ms. Waddington said she could benefit from such improvements.
She tried her local grocery store's delivery service, but her orders didn't arrive until 8 p.m., and on occasion they didn't arrive at all.
The transportation arrangement she has made with her neighbour "has been absolutely heaven," Ms. Waddington said. But she worries about what she will do if some day the neighbour can't drive her.
"It won't last forever," she said. "We just take that one day at a time."

Full text:   Investment guru who took the advice 'buy low, sell high' to extremes was a devout Presbyterian. He later dedicated large portions of his fortune to promoting religion and reconciling it with science
Sir John Templeton was an investor and philanthropist who used a foothold in Canada as a stepping stone to amassing a fortune in global stocks. He later gave hundreds of millions to foster understanding in what he called "spiritual realities."
The foundation he set up awards the Templeton Prize, one of the world's richest, and sponsors conferences and studies reflecting the founder's passionate interest in "progress in religion" and "research or discoveries" on the nebulous borders of science and religion.
In a career that spanned seven decades, Sir John dazzled Wall Street, organized some of the most successful mutual funds of his time, led investors into foreign markets, established charities that now give away $70-million a year, wrote books on finance and spirituality and promoted a search for answers to what he called the "Big Questions" - realms of science, faith, God and the purpose of humanity.
Along the way, he became one of the world's richest men, gave up U.S. citizenship, moved to the Bahamas and bestowed much of his fortune on spiritual thinkers and innovators: Mother Teresa, Billy Graham, Alexander Solzhenitsyn, physicist Freeman Dyson, Montreal philosopher Charles Taylor and a pantheon of Christians, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists and Hindus.
Inevitably, the Templeton charities engendered controversy. Critics called his "spiritual realities" a contradiction in terms, reflecting a fundamental incompatibility between science and religion. To many, the very idea of "progress" in religion seemed strange, and giving grants for "discoveries" in the field invited accusations that science was being manipulated to promote religion.
But Sir John was unmoved. A Yale graduate, a Rhodes Scholar, an audacious investor and a Presbyterian who preached open-mindedness and eschewed literal interpretations of Scripture, Sir John began annual meetings with prayers - to clear the minds of shareholders, he said. And he made billions as a pioneer in his globally diversified Templeton funds, often taking the old advice of "buy low, sell high" to extremes.
In 1939, at the beginning of the Second World War, the 26-year-old investor borrowed $10,000 and bought 100 shares each in 104 companies that were selling at $1 a share or less, including 34 in bankruptcy. A few years later, he was turning large profits on 100 of the companies. Just four turned out to be worthless.
In 1940, he bought a small investment firm that became Templeton, Dubbrow and Vance, the early foundation of his empire. Sir John embarked on mutual funds in 1954, establishing the Templeton Growth Fund in Canada to cut the taxes of many shareholders - Canada had no capital gains tax at the time - and to emphasize the global reach of the firm's investment strategy.
As investor interest widened in the 1950s, he started funds specializing in nuclear energy, chemicals, electronics and technology. The idea was to invest in companies worldwide with the prospect of returns based on future earnings growth, a so-called bottom-up, value-investing style. In 1959, with five funds and $66-million under management, he joined a surge of funds going public. Growth was dramatic. The flagship Templeton Growth Fund reported a 14.5-per-cent average annual return from 1954 to 1992 - a $10,000 investment, with dividends reinvested, would have grown to $2-million.
"We must remain patient, flexible in our outlook, and always aware that eventually all securities and assets will be priced according to their future earnings," he wrote in the foreword to the 2002 book Engines That Move Markets by Alasdair Nairn.
In 1992, a month before he turned 82, Sir John sold the Templeton family of funds - scores of them, with $13-billion in assets - and turned to the philanthropies that had engaged him for decades.
"What we say about investments isn't as lasting as what we say about spiritual matters," he said the following year, although Franklin Templeton Investments still offers visitors to its website a link to his "16 Rules for Investment Success."
While he was an elder of the American branch of the Presbyterian Church and a board member of the Princeton Theological Seminary, Sir John took a broad view of spirituality, espousing non-literal views of heaven and hell and a shared divinity between humanity and God.
Contending that almost nothing of God was actually "known" through Scriptures and theology, he founded the Templeton Prize in 1972 to foster "progress in religion" - an idea that included philosophy and exemplary conduct relating to love, gratitude, forgiveness and creativity. He called it an effort to redress the fact that no Nobel Prize was given for religion, and always made sure that his award offered more money than the Nobels.
Officially called the Templeton Prize for Progress Toward Research or Discoveries about Spiritual Realities, it mirrors his investment strategy: Diversification yields the greatest return in the long run.
"I am still an enthusiastic Christian," he once said, explaining his commitment to what he called religious progress. "But why shouldn't I try to learn more? Why shouldn't I go to Hindu services? Why shouldn't I go to Muslim services? If you are not egotistical, you will welcome the opportunity to learn more."
In 1973, he announced that the first recipient of the prize was Mother Teresa of Calcutta (she received $85,000 for her charities). In the 35 years since, the prize, given in London, has grown to $1.6-million. And its criteria has been refined in recent years to encompass "progress toward research or discoveries about spiritual realities."
The Templeton Foundation, based in West Conshohocken, Pa., was established in 1987 to administer the prize and promote "projects to apply scientific methodology to the study of religious subjects," with room for theoretical physics, evolutionary biology, cognitive science and researches into love, human purpose and the nature and origin of religious beliefs. Today, with a $1.5-billion endowment, it largely sustains the controversial modern movement to reconcile science and religion.
Foundation projects have included a multimillion-dollar study of forgiveness and a two-year study to demonstrate the effect of prayer on 600 patients about to undergo surgery.
Many critics contend that reconciling science and religion is not possible, and that studies to that end are naive, quixotic or motivated by a desire to put religious beliefs on an equal footing with scientific knowledge. But others defend the foundation's approach, insisting that science has no monopoly on truth and that religion and science can co-operate productively.
"We have somehow to break down the barriers between our contemporary culture of science and disciplined academic study ... and the domain of the spirit," said Dr. Taylor, professor emeritus at McGill University, in accepting the prize in 2007.
Sir John grew up in a small town near Dayton, Tenn., the scene of the 1925 Scopes "monkey trial" that famously pitted Clarence Darrow against William Jennings Bryan in a battle over the theory of evolution versus fundamentalist views of creation. Having been raised in a devout household, issues in the case dominated his later life. He eventually wrote at least eight books on spiritual matters.
Ever industrious even as a youngster, he purchased a broken-down Ford from a local farmer and rebuilt it with some friends using spare parts from another old car. He drove it until the end of high school, when he became the first person in his town to attend college.
He attended Yale, all while paying his own tuition during the Depression by earning scholarships, doing administrative work for the school and beating his classmates in poker, according to a 1999 profile in Wired magazine. He graduated near the top of his class in 1934, won a Rhodes Scholarship to Balliol College at Oxford University and earned a master's degree in law. Although the law school there was known for its socialist leanings at the time, he remained uncritical of capitalism as a student.
At 24, he set off on a seven-month tour of 35 countries with fellow Oxford Christian James Inksetter. They slept on ship decks and ate vegetables, fruit and day-old bread to conserve their money. "This education in thrift prepared me for a career of selling advice to wealthy families by searching for stocks whose basic value seemed to be many times greater than the market price," he said in 2004.
Before he left for his travels he had written to 100 investment firms, letting them know he'd be available for hire when he got back. When he returned in 1937, there was a job waiting for him at the Wall Street firm Fenner and Beane.
That year, he married the former Judith Folk and the pair pinched pennies to save enough money to open an independent counselling firm. He later said they made a game of it by vowing to save 50 per cent of their income by finding the most frugal deals.
The couple had three children. His wife died in 1951; he remarried to Irene Reynolds Butler seven years later.
Among his many gifts was the 1984 endowment of Templeton College, a business and management school at Oxford. After many years on Wall Street, he renounced his U.S. citizenship in the 1960s, became a British subject and moved to the Bahamas, a commonwealth that has long been a tax haven. He was knighted in 1987.
Sir John said his investment record improved after he distanced himself from Wall Street and no longer worried about the tax consequences of his decisions. He was an early investor in Japan in the 1960s and later in Russia, China and other Asian markets. He sold large holdings before the technology bubble burst in 2000, and warned several years ago that real-estate prices were dangerously high. He also turned over the running of his foundation to his son, John.
In Nassau, his net worth swelled into the billions, but his lifestyle remained relatively modest. He said his success had largely resulted from his ability to maintain an elevated mood, avoid anxiety and remain disciplined. Uninterested in consumerism, he drove his own car and never flew first class.
In 1998, he estimated that, apart from spiritual programs, he had watched fewer than 84 hours of television in his life, according to an article in Investor's Business Daily. Instead, he spent his days reading, writing and managing his foundation. Visitors were given sandwiches, tea and courtly advice in the afternoon at his white-columned antebellum home on Lyford Cay, set on a hillside lush with citrus trees and bougainvillea, overlooking a golf course and the ocean.

Big hair and a loud personality can take you only so far

Abstract: (HGTV, 8 p.m.) is all about [Tatiana Londono]. The premise is that we watch as real-estate-agent-turned-broker Tatiana opens up her own agency and attempts to conquer the urban real-estate world in Montreal. According to HGTV, Tatiana "relentlessly takes on the 'big boys' - the national real-estate companies." We are asked to be gripped by this mystery - "Can this ballsy wife and mother rise to the top of the urban real-estate game and have it all?"

Full text:   Stand back, people. Take cover. I bring you this warning: "Blond Tatiana, with the big boobs and the curly hair, is coming to get you."
Who the heck is Tatiana? I asked myself the same question.
You see, the other day I received a note from a publicity person. It had this declaration: "We think Tatiana Londono is unlike any real-estate reality show or doc-soap personality to date and hope you get a chance to give a look."
Now there's a come-on. So, it being July and having had my fill of watching How Do You Solve a Problem Like Maria? (a camp classic of bad TV, best enjoyed in very small doses) and with everyone else who covers the TV racket having absconded to L.A. to write about the shocking state of the U.S. TV industry, from the vantage point of a cocktail party at the Beverly Hilton, I succumbed. It is up to me. So I watched The Property Shop , which is the vehicle for the allegedly original and startling Tatiana.
Besides, the come-on from the PR machine and the existence of Tatiana raise an interesting question: What makes for a good TV personality? What are the ingredients necessary to connect with viewers? And by "TV personality" I mean both those people who don't do much except introduce or host filler TV, and those who are suddenly sprung from their day jobs into TV stardom when their job becomes the focus of a show.
Is it ego, charm or volubility? Is it wit? Is it good looks? Or is it simply the ability to natter endlessly about nothing in particular, as that Ryan Seacrest does? What exactly makes Debbie Travis or Mike Holmes emerge from the ranks of people doing a job to become television stars?
Whatever it is, I'm not sure that Tatiana has it. She has the hair, for sure. I'm not going near the topic of what she describes as her big boobs. What Tatiana has, in buckets, is attitude.
The Property Shop (HGTV, 8 p.m.) is all about Tatiana. The premise is that we watch as real-estate-agent-turned-broker Tatiana opens up her own agency and attempts to conquer the urban real-estate world in Montreal. According to HGTV, Tatiana "relentlessly takes on the 'big boys' - the national real-estate companies." We are asked to be gripped by this mystery - "Can this ballsy wife and mother rise to the top of the urban real-estate game and have it all?"
Tatiana is all pep and vinegar, and charmingly certain that she is unique, a true star. In the first 60 seconds of the episode I saw, she makes the assertion about her hair and her boobs and coming to get you. A little later she says, "I'm not only a super-mom. I think I'm a super-woman."
Certainly, she has presence. We get close-up footage of her legs and shoes breezing down the street at a rapid pace. We see a lot of her hair. And, boy, do we hear her. She squawks, squeals, shouts and is on the verge of screeching when she meets a "flipper," a guy who has bought a property to flip, and wants her to sell it.
What she lacks, as do many self-proclaimed TV personalities, is a good sense of humour and some self-deprecation. Debbie Travis has a sense of humour. Mike Holmes has a rather dry wit that emerges when necessary. Tatiana seems to think that making sarcastic remarks and cackling is a form of wit. It isn't.
The TV cameras love Tatiana and Tatiana loves the cameras and attention, but she loves it way too much. Somebody needs to tell Tatiana to take it down a few notches.
Usually, with the sort of TV personalities who are part of the firmament that Tatiana wants to join, there's either a narrative about the personality or the personality is merely a bland facilitator who helps the narrative unfold. We see Mike Holmes rescue someone's home. We see Debbie Travis bring colour and light to a dank situation. People whose names escape me just tell us what's going on as somebody else does the work. With Tatiana, the narrative appears to be about her rise to the top of the real-estate racket in Montreal. Well, as Tatiana herself says with abandon, "whatever!"
Big hair and boobs, yes. Beguiling? No.

Also airing tonight
The Baby Borrowers (NBC, 9 p.m.) is the talked-about summer reality series in which babies and small children are separated from their parents so that teenage couples - those who think parenting is easy and want to have kids soon - can temporarily take care of them. NBC says the series acts as a public service to both the teenagers who took part in the show and teenage viewers, by showing them the reality of parenting. So far, mind you, hardly anybody is watching, except people who are outraged by it. Like, those teenagers who need education about raising kids are definitely, totally not watching. J.D.

Full text:   Tennis's seven-time Grand Slam singles winner Mats Wilander has listed his home in the Idaho resort area of Sun Valley for $8.5-million (U.S.).
The Swedish-born Mr. Wilander and his wife, Sonya, a former model, bought the 80-acre parcel in the 1990s and built their main residence there in 1999. It's about a 20-minute drive southeast of Ketchum.
The 10,500-square-foot main house, contemporary in style, has a large exercise room and a soundproofed music room.
The property also offers a guest house, caretaker's residence, lap pool and hot tub.
However, there is no tennis court. That's because the couple wanted to create a retreat away from tennis for their four children, says listing agent Trent Jones of Hall & Hall.
The 43-year-old Mr. Wilander, who won his last Grand Slam at 24, is currently in Britain coaching at Wimbledon.
FLORIDA ESTATE SELLS
BELOW ITS 2001 PRICE
British Internet entrepreneur Stuart Lawley has sold his Jupiter, Fla., riverfront mansion for $4.65-million - about 22 per cent less than he paid for it in 2001.
In the late 1990s, Mr. Lawley founded oneview.net, which helped businesses get on the Web, and eventually sold the company. (Recently, Mr. Lawley tried to create a separate area on the Web for pornography sites via a dot-xxx domain name.)
He paid $5.925-million for the 9,700-square-foot house called Villa Del Fiume. Built in 1998, the Mediterranean-style home is on 1.7 acres and includes a two-bedroom guest house and a dock. Jupiter, in southeast Florida, is also home to Tiger Woods.
Mr. Lawley sold the house to comply with a divorce settlement with his former wife, Amanda, who co-owned the property, according to Les Bryant of Continental Realty Auctions, who handled the sale with Illustrated Properties, an affiliate of Christie's Great Estates. Mr. Lawley's ex-wife could not be reached for comment.
Mr. Lawley had put the house up for sale in an auction broadcast on the Web in April, seeking $4.5-million, but did not find a buyer. Mr. Bryant said that a Boston-based marketing executive who saw the auction advertised, but wasn't able to see the house before the event, eventually bought the home.
CONDO IN WASHINGTON, D.C.
PRICED AT $10.6-MILLION
A manufacturing executive has listed a condominium in Washington, D.C., for what may be the city's highest-ever price for an apartment.
The 6,650-sq.-ft., six-bedroom apartment in Georgetown, overlooking the Potomac River, has gone on the market for $10.6-million. The owners are Eric Steiner - chief operating officer of Fairchild Corp., which supplies motorcycle gear and airplane parts - and his wife, Pascaline. The couple combined three units in the 70-unit Water Street building, which was built in 2004.
The combined maintenance fees are $6,838 a month, plus $200 for four garage spaces. The building has a rooftop pool, fitness room and 24-hour staff.
Only five apartments, costing more than $1.5-million, sold in Washington through May of this year, down from 18 in the same period last year, according to the local real estate association. The record for a condo sale in the city is thought to be a Georgetown sale of $6.25-million.

Buyers at Butternut Village in Uxbridge will be able to move into the last 11 freehold townhouses by mid-winter. They represent the last phase in Alliance Homes' community about 40 kilometres northeast of Toronto.
The development will include 80 homes in total, situated on Brock Street, just east of Sixth Concession Road.
For those looking to move in sooner, some inventory homes from previous phases - including a 1,489-square-foot bungalow with a loft on a 50-foot lot - are at the drywall stage and can be ready within six to eight weeks.
According to the builder, the setting and location of the project have been strong selling points with buyers, including locals and people from other parts of the Greater Toronto Area. The site is situated amid green spaces, and includes a park and pond. As well, it's near amenities such as a shopping plaza, schools, community centre and golf courses.
"Uxbridge is a beautiful community," says Kathryn MacFarlane, director of sales and marketing for Alliance. "There's greenspace that comes up the back of our subdivision where a walking trail hooks up with downtown."
Models range from a 1,170-square-foot plan with two bedrooms and two bathrooms to a 2,023-square-foot design with three bedrooms and three bathrooms.
Every plan has the master bedroom on the main floor.
The Blackberry showcases many of the features that can be found in other plans. The 1,178-square-foot, two-bedroom model can have either a standard or alternate layout.
In both versions, the garage can be reached directly from the house via a laundry room, and the rear master bedroom has an en suite and walk-in closet.
The standard layout comes with an eat-in kitchen and combined living and dining area. The alternate contains a second bedroom/den near the front door, and a kitchen with breakfast bar that adjoins a great room in the rear.
Interior details include solid oak handrails and balusters on the main staircase, 40-ounce broadloom in the living room and bedrooms, and imported ceramic tile flooring elsewhere.
For a limited time, buyers will get upgraded features such as granite countertops and maple cabinetry in the kitchen, pot lights in the living room, and hardwood flooring in the principal room.
Brick facades will feature precast stone, vinyl or wood accents, as well as gables.

Consider new products for that new deck

Author: Holmes, Mike

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/consider-new-products-that-deck/docview/382707236/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Cedar is naturally resistant to insect damage and rot, so it needs less maintenance than PT wood. Unless your cedar deck comes into direct contact with the ground - and it shouldn't if it's built properly - you won't need to treat it with preservatives at all. Cedar can be allowed to weather to a grey colour, or you can stain it. But once you stain it, you'll have to maintain it regularly.

Full text:   Now that summer's here, many homeowners are thinking about new decks, which are great additions to any living space.
Before you start looking for a contractor, however, you need to make a call to your local building authority.
There's a good possibility you will need a permit for your deck - especially if it's attached to your house or above a certain height.
And, obviously, you don't want to put out the money for a new deck and then have to take it down.
If you don't get a permit and you're found out, that's what can happen. Don't take a chance.
There are lots of things you need to be clear about in order to build a safe and well-constructed deck. Do you need railings? Are they tall enough? Is the spacing correct? What about the stairs - are the risers correct?
You also need to think about the material you'll use. There are lots of options.
PRESSURE-TREATED WOOD
This is a popular choice for decks and fences because it's usually the least costly. Pressure-treated (PT) wood is impregnated with chemicals that help it resist rot and insects, making it ideal for exterior projects.
There was a lot of controversy about PT wood in the past because arsenic was used to treat it. But that product was taken off the market in Canada about four years ago. A copper compound is now used instead of arsenic, and it's perfectly safe if you work with it properly and don't burn it.
With copper-treated wood, your contractor has to use the correct fasteners. If the screws and joist hangers aren't specifically labelled for use with PT wood, they will corrode when the wood gets wet. Aluminum and copper don't mix and regular galvanized nails and screws won't hold up for long. Initially, this will cause staining on your deck around these screws and hangers, and then structural failure when they corrode away.
PT wood needs to be maintained because it is not water resistant. You should clean it annually to remove dirt or moss, then apply a sealer to protect against moisture damage and splintering. You can also paint or stain the wood.
CEDAR
I love the look of cedar, but it is more expensive than PT wood, no question. One way of saving money if you like the look of cedar is to build the structure and supports out of PT wood, and use cedar for the planks and rails.
Cedar is naturally resistant to insect damage and rot, so it needs less maintenance than PT wood. Unless your cedar deck comes into direct contact with the ground - and it shouldn't if it's built properly - you won't need to treat it with preservatives at all. Cedar can be allowed to weather to a grey colour, or you can stain it. But once you stain it, you'll have to maintain it regularly.
You should wash your cedar deck every year with a mild detergent and water, but don't use a pressure washer on it. Cedar is too soft and can be damaged this way.
COMPOSITE WOOD
Composite wood is made of a variety of materials, usually polyethylene or polypropylene mixed with wood fibre or wood flour. It can look a lot like real wood, with embossed wood-grain patterns and texture. Composite wood comes in a variety of colours, is UV-resistant, won't fade, stain, twist, split or warp, and it's resistant to insects.
When this product first came out, I wasn't really enthusiastic about it, but it has been improved and I'm starting to like it. Composite wood is as much as five times more expensive than PT wood, but over the long term you'll save a lot on maintenance.
A lot of composite wood material is somewhat softer than real wood, and isn't available in long spans, so your contractor will have to place the joists closer together.
RESIN DECKING
This has no wood in it at all, so it definitely won't absorb moisture. It's lightweight and durable, is resistant to mould, won't splinter or crack, and it comes in a variety of colours.
In general, make sure your contractor has lots of experience building decks.
Just because the project is outside your house doesn't mean you should be casual about who you hire. A lot of guys start out in the business by building decks and fences; make sure the contractor you hire knows what he's doing. Check references and get lots of quotes.
Some people say a deck "should be" built for an average of $5 a square foot (labour and materials for the deck surface and structure only). There is no average - every situation is different, depending on materials, access, details, size, and the experience and skill of the contractor.

Full text:   Who could have guessed with such a clever cover-up: pull dandelions outside, propagate weed inside
'Ijust feel silly," said my next-door neighbour, a young military man. "I had no idea there was a grow-op across the street."
If the two retired cops on the block were aware of anything, they had kept mum.
I asked our local garbage picker what he knew. Chancy, as he likes to be called, lives in the well-kept duplex just past the stop sign. He has a great facility for sizing up people based on what they put out on garbage day. Yet he too knew nothing. "The garbage on this street is boring," he said.
I can only wonder what Psychic Diana, working in her shop around the corner, saw in her crystal ball.
For the rest of us the tip-off was the unmarked police cars crowding the street in front of the little stone bungalow. A quorum of well-fed, ponytailed "undercover" policemen were hanging about outside.
The rumble of questions began. What had been going on in that house since it had been sold four years ago?
A new For Sale sign now stands on the lawn. We've had a lot more traffic on the street because of it. I doubt the passersby even know about the crime scene. Nothing on the outside suggests a nefarious deed.
No, the handsome little house covered in flagstone attracts people with its good looks alone. I expect they don't even notice the quiet, two-block street's other attributes. The educational possibilities, for example, are hard to match. At one end of the road we have a library and at the other a driving school offering Bible studies.
Few house hunters pass through at night, so they would never know we are blessed with an everlasting red sunset from the glow of a Canadian Tire sign, appropriately to the west.
What does a grow-op nestled in a small neighbourhood look like? I wanted to see the evidence of the crime. The police had cleared out the place but I thought the walls might talk. A friend in the real-estate business promised to take me for a tour.
The house had been a project of love and renewal for a previous owner. Built in 1947, it had been in good shape when she bought it, yet she found lots of things that needed improving. She got particular joy out of working on the wooden floors and doors. She was mindful of the nature, age and grain of the resource in her hands.
Her workroom in the basement felt safely cocooned from the world. She organized it with precision - something one might expect of a military nurse. She had enlisted years ago and gone on a peacekeeping mission to Bosnia. Like so many others, she had returned with demons in her head. Having her hands on wood in the winter and in earth in the summer helped.
She nurtured the irises, peonies and roses in her garden and hovered protectively around the baby tree that promised one day to shade her south-facing house. She left in haste out of restlessness, and many of us are sad we didn't do more to persuade her to stay.
The young couple who moved in kept mostly to themselves. They rented the house from absentee landlords whose prime concern was receipt of their monthly cheque.
I only saw the couple occasionally, saying hello when they were gardening. Now I'm kicking myself for not asking more questions - or any at all. But who could have guessed of the crime with such a clever cover-up - pull dandelions outside while secretly propagating weed inside? And this wasn't their only grow-op. Another neighbourhood in town got to witness the excitement of their arrest.
My real-estate friend came over after dinner, and the curious - my husband, two teenaged daughters and me - followed her across the street.
As soon as she opened the door the stench of mould engulfed us. It smarted in the eyes and left an acrid taste at the back of the tongue. No wonder the police had gone in with masks. It was like walking into the set of a horror film. "The kind of film" my older daughter said, "where as soon as the kids go into the abandoned house all the doors swing shut and lock."
The humidity necessary to grow marijuana wept black streaks of mould from ceiling to floor. The once cream-coloured paint was death grey. All the grates on the vents had been pulled out of the floor and walls to allow for a freer flow of warm air to keep the plants happy.
The tenants had kept their electricity use at a reasonable level by removing all the appliances. The back bedroom had a sheet of plywood holding up the ceiling, supported by a lone two-by-four in the middle of the room.
The scent of marijuana was only evident in the basement, where it saturated the beams and hung densely in the air. To survive a wrecking crew, this house would need money and imagination.
Our suburb was swallowed by the growing city years ago. Surrounded by old blood on one side, new immigrants on the other and a commercial base searching for an identity, we lack built-in cohesiveness. But maybe the unearthing of the grow-op will give us an opportunity to grow better neighbours instead of pot.

Full text:   After a lifetime in Alberta, Don Evernden sold off his charter aviation business and moved to Saskatchewan, drawn by the kind of economic boom he has witnessed in his home province.
Mr. Evernden, 73, bought a farm last year northwest of Saskatoon, cashing in on the growing agriculture sector, and went looking for another opportunity.
The investment that caught his eye was McNab Park, a rundown former military base bordering the Saskatoon airport where old barracks have been used for decades as low-income housing for about 400 people. Some city officials consider the neighbourhood an "eyesore" at the gateway to the city and have longed to redevelop it. Mr. Evernden had the same idea when he bought the land in January for $17-million.
His plans, however, have pitted him against the area's residents, in a struggle that has become a symbol of the tension created by the rapid growth of the city.
"We believe in this project," Mr. Evernden says. "It just might take longer than we first expected."
The unprecedented boom in the commodities Saskatchewan produces, ranging from oil and gas to uranium, potash and agricultural crops, is forcing local business to adjust.
Michael Grace, the president of Kingsmere Capital Corp., a local investment firm, says Saskatoon has many strengths but has been caught off guard by the pace of growth and is spinning its wheels to catch up. The challenges facing investors are the labour and housing shortages. Major companies have been reticent to relocate to the city because there's a lack of housing for their employees, which has slowed investment, he said.
On the other hand, local businesses find themselves delivering an unfamiliar pitch to potential hires, notes David Williams, a professor at the University of Saskatchewan's Edwards School of Business. No longer do they trumpet the region's cheap housing and cost of living; instead, they are talking up what a great place it is to relocate to and invest in real estate.
"We're a humble people here and we're not used to all this attention. We're all looking at each other and thinking 'how did this happen?' "
It may just be getting started. There's a building boom in houses and condominiums, industrial traffic crowds the streets, old, rundown apartment buildings are being rebuilt into big-city condos, and the population of 208,000 is growing at a rate not seen in a century. Cranes and traffic jams, once rare, are now part of everyday life.
Mr. Evernden plans to turn McNab Park into a high-end business park. He believes the development will attract major hotel chains and some of the country's big resource players who are looking to gain proximity to an expanding airport, he says.
The intense growth, however, is creating many of the problems that still plague Alberta, where the inflow of workers and money sent the housing market climbing to record highs, and made it nearly impossible to find affordable accommodation, even on a good wage.
"The high prices are eating into the working poor," Mr. Williams said. "It's the people who are working two or three part-time jobs who have seen their rents skyrocket that are being hurt."
In Saskatoon, housing prices were up more than 50 per cent last year alone, a leap on top of a market that had already been ticking up. The city's industrial vacancy rate is below 2 per cent for the first time in its history, while construction costs have more than doubled in the past three years. The industrial market continues to grow, with the number of building permits rising 64 per cent last year.
Many of the city's poor are struggling to find housing, and shortages of labour and materials have caused major construction delays and cost overruns. Contractors from as far away as Detroit have had to fly in their own work crews.
"We think we've learned from Alberta's experience before us," said senior city planner Alan Wallace. "But what we've learned is that it's impossible to keep up. You're basically reacting continuously."
For Mr. Evernden's Calgary-based project management team, this has meant a public battle with McNab Park's 400 tenants, many of whom see their neighbourhood disappearing and have nowhere to go in a rental market that still lacks low-income options.
City councillor Pat Lorje says the McNab Park development has become a symbol of the people being left behind as the rest of the city moves forward.
"We are creating the conditions for an incredible amount of social unrest. They're shutting down the equivalent of a small town," she said. "It's going to be difficult for these people to find accommodation let alone afford accommodation."
Mr. Evernden's group has come up with one solution to the housing problems created by his plans for McNab Park. It has teamed up with a local developer, Innovative Assets Inc., that is literally moving many of the neighbourhood's rundown houses and apartment buildings across the city, then refurbishing them in their new locale.
Ms. Lorje said the city is implementing several affordable housing initiatives and working with the province to implement measures to help keep up with the growth. The city has struck what it calls a "future growth team" to come up with a strategy to cope with the boom.
The province, for its part, has moved to ease the labour shortage by beginning to develop programs to encourage aboriginal people to train for the skilled trades, where demand is soaring. It has reached arrangements with countries such as the Philippines to recruit workers for areas of high demand.
It has also invested $400-million more in infrastructure than it did last year, pouring money into roads, schools and hospitals, drawing a lesson from the experience in Alberta, where such facilities were overwhelmed.

Full text:   Mudge, Gabriola islanders stirred up again as ferry rates soar
His handle in real estate is "Mudge Maguire," and there was a time when the concept of a bridge across Mudge Island didn't strike him as an awful idea.
Today, the realtor and water-taxi operator is unapologetic about his reluctance to open up his island community to traffic and visitors.
"We are being selfish," Fred Maguire said yesterday, referring to the remote lifestyle that he and fellow islanders - all 70 of them - have adopted.
The decades-old bridge debate was reignited last week after B.C. Ferries president David Hahn floated the idea of building a fixed link in response to complaints about rising ferry fares.
Currently, the corporation operates a route linking Gabriola Island to downtown Nanaimo on Vancouver Island. It's just a 20-minute sailing, but it effectively serves as a gateway, restricting access to the island of 4,500 souls. The round trip for a car and driver costs $28.80, though commuters can get a discount that brings the price down to about $18.00.
With its tiny population, Mudge Island doesn't rate a ferry service, but if a fixed link were to be built, the island would be in the path of progress. A bridge across Dodd Narrows would tie Mudge to Vancouver Island at the community of Cedar, just south of Nanaimo. A second bridge would then take traffic through to Gabriola.
"It would destroy both islands," Mr. Maguire said.
He moved to Mudge in 1971, where he lived in a cabin. Today, he has his dream home, where last weekend he entertained the grandchildren, who were free to wander down to the beach without supervision. "We have a piece of heaven over here."
B.C. Ferries' Mr. Hahn, who has fielded numerous complaints about recent rate increases, saw an opportunity to end the grumbling over fares and service by agreeing with one critic's suggestion to test support for replacing ferry service with a fixed link.
The idea came from Gabriola resident Jeremy Baker, although he wasn't planning to go public with his suggestion. The subject is too hot to debate with his neighbours.
In an interview, Mr. Baker defended the notion, saying a fixed link would mean the end of dependence on B.C. Ferries. He is no newbie; he has lived on the island for 36 years. But he also runs a courier service and feels the rate increases more acutely than residents who rarely venture off their island.
He feels demographics on Gabriola could be swinging his way. Older people are leaving the island, which has limited health services, and rising real-estate prices are attracting a new breed of islander.
"What's wrong with checking people's attitudes? If B.C. Ferries is going to keep whacking us over and over again [with fare increases], some new way of dealing with this issue should be looked at."
Mr. Hahn has handed the contentious issue to the island's local ferry committee, a reluctant participant in the debate. He said he is willing to fund a survey of residents to see whether they want to end their reliance on the ferry service that links them to Nanaimo.
He said he is not advocating a bridge in lieu of ferry service, but is simply giving the islanders a chance to have their say. "People are looking at us to be creative."
A fixed link wasn't a viable concept eight years ago, when a study pegged the cost of building it at $50-million. Construction costs would drive the price higher now, but Mr. Hahn believes an alternative to ferry service could be feasible given today's fuel prices. "You look at everything differently at $142 a barrel of oil."
On Gabriola, however, the debate seems toxic.
"The bloody bridge," said Jerry MacLeod, sitting at a patio table at a local café, Raspberries. "I went through the last round of this," she said.
"We had fathers not speaking to sons, lifelong friendships ended. It was like the referendum in Quebec."
David Boehm remembers when it cost $2.50 to ride the ferry to the island. People here are angry with significant fare hikes and service disruptions. On Sunday night, service was suspended because of a crew shortage. "We are hostages of B.C. Ferries," he said. But he opposes a bridge. "It would dilute the flavour of the island."
Antony Holland, an 88-year-old actor, leaned over the patio rail to chime in: "We don't want one. We might as well go live in the suburbs of Vancouver."
Gabriola is busy at this time of year with tourists and summer residents. Ken Capon, another long-time resident, said he and his wife left Vancouver to embrace the island pace of life. "You put in a bridge and it's no longer an island."
Kathy Ramsey owns Gabriola Artworks. The island boasts one of the highest concentrations of artists in the country, she said, people who could be driven out if the island becomes too accessible. "A bridge is a conduit for what we try to keep away from here."
One resident, Terry, sitting in his beat-up GMC pickup, said he supports the bridge. But he didn't want to give his last name.
That didn't surprise Andre Lemieux, head of the local ferry committee. It agreed yesterday to go ahead with the survey, provided B.C. Ferries provides a clear business plan so people know what they are voting on. People on Mudge Island will be included in the survey, he said.
He said the issue is hugely contentious on the islands, and while many residents are opposed, he said there are many people in favour - but supporters tend to be reluctant to speak up.
Gisela Sartori believes a bridge would end the lifestyle she enjoys on Gabriola. Sitting on the ferry with her dog Chinook, a husky, she said is a relative newcomer, with less than three years on the island. The former Yukon resident cherishes the simple lifestyle she has now.
"I spent 22 years without running water and having to wash every diaper by hand," she said of her last home. "Now I am paying $550 a month in rent for a place overlooking the ocean. It's heaven on earth."

An inconvenient truth for fishing communities

Author: Leung, Wency

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/inconvenient-truth-fishing-communities/docview/382707582/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: I spoke to one Gloucester fisherman - when they first put in quotas ... it was something like 500 pounds a day - and so he went out and caught 1,500 pounds and he came back and he said to the regulators, "Okay, here's three days' fishing." And they said, "No, that's one day's fishing and you have to throw 1,000 pounds away."

Full text:   Overfishing, climate change and pollution aren't just damaging the world's fish stocks. These issues are also threatening a way of life for fishing communities that have existed for generations, according to New York author Mark Kurlansky, writer of the bestselling culinary and cultural history books, Cod , Salt and The Big Oyster .
Mr. Kurlansky's latest book, The Last Fish Tale , delves into the history of America's oldest fishing port, Gloucester, Mass., and examines why the future of the port concerns coastal towns and cities around the world.
In the book, Mr. Kurlansky explains there are fish tales and Gloucester stories. Fish tales have happy, if exaggerated, endings. Gloucester stories end in tragedy.
Mr. Kurlansky spoke to The Globe and Mail from Seattle, where he was promoting his new book.
You describe the rise of coastal tourism as a loss for maritime towns and cities. Why?
Once the tourism comes in, it just prices out the commercial fishing. Mooring space becomes unaffordable to fishermen, real estate becomes unaffordable to fishermen, and more and more of the town loses the culture that drew tourism there in the first place. ... In places like Gloucester, you see people who move there and they want to close down the fish plant because it's smelly and they want to dock their yacht in the harbour and get the bottom-draggers out.
You mention that fishermen
believe if they just hang in there, the fisheries will eventually return. What's at stake
if they're wrong and this is,
indeed, the last fish tale?
Then we're all in a lot of trouble. If we start talking about marine life completely vanishing, this planet is in a lot of trouble. And culturally, places like New England and Canada lose their primary culture and a sense of who they are.
In the book, I go to Newfoundland ... [where] some of the old fishermen are staying around and crabbing, but there's nothing for young people. They're all in British Columbia or Alberta. So what is the future of the place?
You say government fisheries management programs - and Canada's in particular - have
actually contributed to overfishing. How so?
In the 1970s, when the 200-mile limits were established [to enforce exclusive fishing zones], the idea should have been that now the government could manage their own fisheries. ... But in the case of Canada and the U.S., the government viewed it as an opportunity to just expand fisheries so that local fishing could take the place of the foreign fishing they kicked out.
In Canada, the government directly participated in building up their fishing fleets and built a very destructive fleet for the Grand Banks - more destructive than the foreign fishing they had been complaining about.
Why are quotas wasteful?
Most fish, when they're caught, are dead. And so if you throw them out, it's just a complete loss.
I spoke to one Gloucester fisherman - when they first put in quotas ... it was something like 500 pounds a day - and so he went out and caught 1,500 pounds and he came back and he said to the regulators, "Okay, here's three days' fishing." And they said, "No, that's one day's fishing and you have to throw 1,000 pounds away."
Why does commercial fishing seem bent on destroying itself?
The short answer is it isn't. There are two separate problems that need different solutions. One is long-distance fleets - where governments from rich countries and rich companies make deals with poor countries, like Peru and Senegal, and go down and strip their fishing grounds. That's an international problem that needs a lot of diplomacy and international co-operation.
The other problem is just maintaining the fisheries. How does the U.S. maintain fisheries in U.S. waters and how does Canada maintain fisheries in Canadian waters? There, they have been under very heavy, strict regulations and have worked very hard to make fishing sustainable. In many cases, they have failed but that failure hasn't been a lack of trying, but a failure to find the right formula.
In Gloucester, you have several competing forces - a need to preserve fish stocks and the
environment, and a need to
preserve fishing culture and keep people employed. How
do you strike a balance?
The feeling is that what's important is that [Gloucester's] central harbour remains marine industrial, and out on the edges, you can have other stuff. They're looking for ways to survive and they're happy to have tourists, but they're trying to keep them out of the space that belongs to fishermen. ...
We live in a time when ways of life and cultures, and even languages, are disappearing at an alarming rate, and I think this is something that should be of tremendous concern.

Full text:   For more than a century, Mount Benson school had served generations of local families. But this week, to the tears of students past and present, it became the latest casualty of a policy that has seen boards across the province shut schools and sell land. The province, though, is reconsidering the wisdom of this action
There is a manic glee in that Alice Cooper line "School's out forever," a perennial favourite of students since the 1970s pop song first hit the airwaves.
But school's final day was a gloomy affair marked by four generations of one Nanaimo family who walked the halls of Mount Benson Elementary this week for the last time.
Misty Duifhuis's grandfather first showed up on the school roll here in 1919. Her mother still recalls the names of her teachers, good and bad. Ms. Duifhuis looked into the cloakroom where she had been sentenced to time outs for laughing too much.
This week, her son Joshua, 7, attended the 134-year-old school's final assembly.
Mount Benson is a casualty of the school district's business plan. Like school districts across the province, squeezed by declining enrolment and funding shortfalls, the Nanaimo Board of Education's had to raise cash for needed projects by liquidating the only assets it has.
Mount Benson was among those closed so it could be prepared to go on the block.
Even before classes finished this week, crews were getting ready to tear out portables. Inside, the library was in a forlorn state, books already packed away in cardboard boxes. The band room was bare, never to hear the clamour of instruments again.
"It was sad, there is so much history here that is going to stop at my children," Ms. Duifhuis said. "It's like a chunk of the community is being broken up and spread out, it's not the centre any more. We are all being displaced."
Mount Benson, judged on its architecture alone, is less than endearing. It's been razed by fire twice, and the current building has spread in an ungainly fashion with half-a-dozen additions.
But it is nestled in a family community, surrounded by a generous expanse of playing fields. Many pupils here can find parents and grandparents in class photos on the wall that date back to 1894.
Joshua Duifhuis will go to another elementary school in September, but he doesn't expect to see any of his current classmates there. The 175 pupils who finished classes this week will be heading to at least four different schools.
Mount Benson is just one of 171 schools closed due to declining enrolment since the B.C. Liberal government took office in 2001. Six more are to close this year, while 26 new schools have been built in fast-growing communities.
It has brought tremendous upheaval to an estimated 22,000 pupils and their families.
Now the province is reconsidering the wisdom of selling off schools.
In an interview this week, Education Minister Shirley Bond said she wants to take a careful look at school closings and sales to ensure there are enough spaces left to meet future needs. The apparent change of heart comes as the province studies the feasibility of kindergarten classes for children as young as 3.
Ms. Bond said the school sales are not her ministry's doing; school boards make the decisions, she noted.
"We have taken, recently, a more hands-on approach, looking at what's happening with those buildings," she said in a telephone interview from Beijing, where she is meeting with educators to showcase B.C.'s education services. "We need to be prudent in the disposal of those assets."
That hands-on approach, school districts say, amounts to an informal moratorium on the sale of schools. Sales that were driven, they note, by criteria Ms. Bond's government imposed.
Shortly after the Liberals took office, schools became assets subject to multicriteria analysis that forced boards to sell "surplus" to get capital funding from the Education Ministry for maintenance and construction of other schools.
Here's how Mount Benson, Home of the Bobcats, became surplus:
Following ministry guidelines for facilities renewal, the school district produced a business plan identifying its needs, mainly a new high school. The ministry agreed to provide capital funding if the district would bring to the table almost half of the money.
"This money would come from ... the proceeds of the future sale of surplus assets," Ms. Bond wrote the school board last fall.
The board had its schools appraised and came up with a list of properties to sell. Four, including Mount Benson, were valued at a total of $8-million.
Jamie Brennan, chair of the Nanaimo Board of Education, said the school district had little choice. "We had to adapt, the ground was shifting under us."
Mr. Brennan doesn't think fewer, bigger schools is bad for education - so long as parents and teachers work to make it a good experience for the pupils, and that hasn't always happened in the emotional debate over school closings. "I've seen kids pushed up to the microphones," he said with distaste.
However, he also called the ministry's funding criteria "ridiculous" and short sighted.
"I guess the minister has felt the heat about the alienation of all these public assets," he said. "And quite rightly."
Even though the policy that led to the demise of Mount Benson is being reconsidered, Ms. Bond said the closings that have already happened were justified. The total student body in B.C. has shrunk by 50,000 since 2001, a trend that is mirrored in other jurisdictions.
"Many parents will tell you that at the end of what is a very painful, personal process - and I would recognize that - they will say their children are being very well served in their new circumstances."
David Murchie isn't convinced. His youngest son was due to start kindergarten in September, and Thomas would have known just about everyone in his class from his neighbourhood. His older son is distraught over the move to a new school.
"It makes me feel sad," said seven-year-old John Murchie. "I'm not going to be with all of my friends." He can name two girls from his class who will be joining him at Rock City Elementary next year.
Irene Lanzinger, president of the B.C. Teachers' Federation, said the closings hurt pupils who can least afford it.
"It is harmful to vulnerable children who have special needs, or who live in poverty." The closings also result in bigger, more crowded schools and that's not good for anyone, she said. "Smaller schools are better for children. There is less violence, less bullying."
Ms. Lanzinger welcomed the ministry's newfound caution about school closings and sales, but added, "They are 175 schools too late."
Jessica Van der Veen has emerged as a champion in the battle against the school closings. Although her teenaged daughter hasn't been directly affected, Ms. Van der Veen believes the public school system is being undermined.
The declining population of school-aged children is a flimsy excuse for cost-cutting, she said.
"In the year 2005, we had the highest birth rate in Canada in seven years. Those children will be coming into the system in just two years," she noted. In B.C., Statistics Canada shows the birth rate climbing in the consecutive years as well, another echo of Canada's baby boom.
"It seems so crazy. They are selling schools because of a temporary, 7-per-cent dip in enrolment," she said.
But the future of Mount Benson is looking a little brighter even as contractors pick off the pieces. What changed was a visit two months ago from the deputy minister of education, who advised against calling in the real estate agents. No "for sale" sign is up, and the district is negotiating with community groups to keep the school as some kind of public facility.
"The selling off of those public assets is probably not going to happen," Mr. Brennan predicted this week.
What about the business plan, the one that required cash from Mount Benson and others to pay for a new high school? "That was then," he said.
It may be too late to keep the school open, but Mount Benson has another chance to rise from the ashes.
'IT'S THE CANARY'
The realtor's advertisement offered three hectares of "prime development land" in an upscale neighbourhood near Victoria. It was such an unusual property that it didn't include an asking price. But when Patricia Mamic spotted the ad, she jumped at the opportunity to build a new subdivision in her own community.
The site included an elementary school that had closed in 2003. "I used to walk my kids through the schoolyard in their baby buggies and it was boarded up," she said this week. "It was a little haunting; there was kids' art still up on the walls."
Her family company, Mamic Development, won with a bid of $4.3-million. What they were unprepared for was the emotional, anti-privatization campaign against the sale of Fairburn Elementary School that dogged their project.
Linda Travers, of Friends of Fairburn, helped pack community planning meetings to fight the sale.
"It's the canary in the coal mine," she said of the first school sale in the Greater Victoria school district, which has closed seven schools due to declining enrolment.
The parents' group argues the schools should be held as public property for the inevitable day that enrolment comes back up. They also fought to keep the school's playing fields in public hands.
After a lengthy battle, Saanich council approved a scaled-down housing project on the old school grounds last month. Thirty per cent of the site will be reserved for parkland. Mamic sold the building itself and it reopened as a private Montessori school last fall.
Later this summer, the developers expect to begin constructing 18 compact luxury homes that are expected to sell for about $750,000 each.

Full text:   The battle for the future of Oakville's United Way exposes a chasm between the town's wealthy and its working class
A United Way annual general meeting, particularly in a place as quietly affluent as Oakville, is typically a staid affair. That's why it was so shocking when the United Way of Oakville's June 17 meeting erupted into a raucous spectacle of angry denunciations and denials, complete with an unsuccessful attempt to sack the fundraising agency's entire board of directors.
Willie Lambert, the burly United Way board member, Oakville Transit bus driver and labour leader who tried to get himself and the rest of the board fired, seems an unlikely candidate to lead an insurrection - least of all one targeted at such an uncontroversial charitable organization.
Yet for half a year, Mr. Lambert has been the public face of an insurgent coalition of labour and social activists furious that UWO has cut funding to some social-service agencies. The activists' grievances have nearly torn the local United Way apart, and the fight may say a lot about the politics of poverty in one of Canada's wealthiest communities.
According to its own figures, the UWO cut funding this year to 23 of the 31 social-service agencies it funds, by amounts ranging from $1,050 (for the Oakville Literacy Council) to more than $37,000 (for Big Brothers Big Sisters of Halton and Community Development Halton).
Eight other agencies have seen their funding increased by comparable amounts, including an almost $35,000 boost to the Halton Trauma Centre and $33,934 in additional cash for Halton ADAPT, an addiction counselling service.
All of this is the result of an attempt by UWO to restructure the way it allocates grants, putting recipient agencies through an "outcomes measurement" process in which many of them were judged to have performed poorly.
Also this year, UWO stopped allowing disgruntled social-services agencies to appeal funding cuts. The situation has left officials at some of the disappointed agencies "in tears and outraged," according to Dr. Joey Edwardh, the executive director of Community Development Halton, a research and planning organization that assists other non-profits.
Tying social-service-agency grants increasingly to performance assessments is not unique to Oakville. Many other United Way chapters have introduced similar measures.
In Oakville's case, however, the funding cuts landed in the midst of a simmering dispute between the Oakville and District Labour Council, of which Mr. Lambert is president, and UWO, over the firing of Rose Bisson, its union liaison, late last year.
Ms. Bisson said she was dismissed for trying to raise the profile of organized labour within UWO against its management's preference that, in Ms. Bisson's words, unions "just give the money, and go away."
The reference is to the close relationship the United Way has with organized labour; payroll deductions from unionized workplaces typically account for a significant portion of local chapters' annual revenues. Mr. Lambert claimed that, in Oakville, union donations account for 65 per cent of the funds the United Way rakes in. Bruce Felstead, UWO's director of finance and administration, called that figure "totally false." Mr. Felstead said about 10 per cent of the charity's revenue comes from union sources.
In any event, UWO chief executive officer Barbara Burton said there was "no truth" to suggestions that Ms. Bisson had been targeted for her labour advocacy, but she confirmed that "lawyers are talking to lawyers" about her departure.
Whatever the rights and wrongs of Ms. Bisson's firing, it made for a tense relationship between UWO and Oakville's labour community - even before this year's funding cuts were unveiled. When social-service agencies began hearing that their grants had been reduced, they found a ready ally in the Labour Council.
A series of meetings between labour officials and angry agency staff followed, culminating in Mr. Lambert's bid to replace the entire UWO board, which was ruled out of order by its outgoing chair, Gordon Ross.
Mr. Lambert and his supporters did, however, succeed in getting three new allies voted into the 20-member governing body. With their election, Mr. Lambert estimates that he can now count on five votes in addition to his own.
It's hard to separate the rancour at UWO from the peculiar context of the town of Oakville. It boasts some of the country's most expensive real estate, a heavily gentrified downtown and a median household income $32,000 above that of the province.
But Oakville is also home to a 3,500-employee Ford plant and a strong labour movement. Although UWO officials and Oakville Mayor Rob Burton said they did not think issues of class had played a role in the dispute, it has undoubtedly pitted union members and social workers against some of the town's elite. That, at least, is the way Mr. Lambert feels. "There definitely is a hostility and animosity in the United Way for the labour movement and working class," he said.
Ms. Bisson had a similar impression of UWO. "I felt," she said, "in that office there were individuals from very wealthy backgrounds" who were too far removed from the recipients of United Way funding.
With the emotional peak of this month's meeting behind them, UWO's staff and board are determined to make amends and move on. Ann Mulvale, a popular figure who was Oakville's mayor from 1988 until 2006 and will be running the next United Way campaign, is relentlessly optimistic that the damage can be repaired. "We've had excellent relations with labour" over all, she said, even though "... some things could have been executed with greater precision or clarity."
Mr. Lambert seems willing to work within UWO to address his concerns. He warned, however, that "we will try [to unseat the board] again at the '09 [annual general meeting] if things don't improve. We're going to win."

Full text:   We check on progress as a 1935 home gets a state-of-the-art, green technology retrofit
The thing about massive renovation projects is that they always look their worst just before they start to look better.
With that in mind, I visited for the second time the future home of David Daniels - once the home of Major-General Donald M. Hogarth - after first reporting on the project in November, 2007. Designed by Toronto architect Mackenzie Waters in 1935, the 8,000-square-foot, sturdy art deco brick box is slowly, methodically being brought into the 21st century - spatially, sustainably and otherwise - by architect and green expert Paul Dowsett of Scott Morris Architects.
Punctuated by the squeal of power saws, our tour began just outside the home's formal front door, where deliveries were occurring so frequently a turnstile might be more appropriate.
Here, in the wall of the porte-cochere, a large, original metal window has been installed for decorative purposes rather than being sent to landfill; surrounding brick has been salvaged from other areas of the house and the colour and texture of the new mortar has been painstakingly matched.
On the porte-cochere's roof, where once there stood a dilapidated old potter's shed, a modern, glassy guesthouse now sits, which connects to the main house by an equally modern umbilical cord of a bridge. "It was one of the first conceits when we first started talking about the house," says Mr. Daniels about the bridge idea, "and it's actually come true, out of all the crazy ideas that I've had throughout the last few years, and I think it's better than I imagined it."
In a way, the porte-cochere can be seen as a microcosm of the entire project: Old parts have been salvaged and repurposed; efforts have been made to duplicate original work; and there is the marriage of old and new architecture.
In the backyard, stacks of cedar from a demolished sauna await new life as partition walls in the pool house. Underfoot is a rich, creamy "Algonquin stone" from Owen Sound - "as local as we could get," chuckles the architect - that will spill out into the rest of the yard; above our heads is the new, pre-patina'd copper flashing with a folded "three-part detail" to echo the banded (and very deco) lines of the brickwork.
Despite the construction storm before the calm, there is much to see inside the house. Mr. Dowsett is conducting tests of art deco moulding styles for the ceiling, because, as he puts it, "in drawing you can only do so much." The jury is still out on whether these will feature curves, hard angles or a combination of both.
The entire "east wing" addition has now been clad in the high-tech, triple-glazed pale green curtain wall that adorns the other modern additions (in my first report this wing was just a skeleton), and it is here that I got my first glimpse of the much-ballyhooed walnut shell flooring by Granular Hardwood Technologies Ltd., which simulates the look of expensive terrazzo by using waste walnut shell pieces as the aggregate after they've been used to clean jet engines.
Here, too, in what will become a chef's delight of a kitchen is another interesting feature: a remotely activated, large sliding glass door - not unlike the kind at the local grocery store - that Mr. Daniels predicts will become the home's principal entrance. "I think your family is going to live in this room," confirms Mr. Dowsett. "This is the view, it's just stunning."
Not only is the view stunning, so is the performance. The curtain wall system has proven so effective an insulator, an earlier plan to install solar blinds has been scrapped. "Some of this stuff actually works," laughs Mr. Daniels. "As a consumer, you're inundated with it every day now; every day you turn on the TV, you pick up a newspaper or magazine and all you hear about is this green material, that green material, and thank God some of it works!"
Upstairs, awaiting refinishing are original hardwood floors that have been patched with pieces from other areas. Cuts to this three-quarter-century-old wood were done so precisely, says project manager Nick Egizii, the flooring contractors said it was "easier working with this than working with new wood."
Reflective high-albedo paint isn't the only thing covering the roof this time. Lined up like a giant's fallen dominos are massive solar panels that will supply the home with its entire hot water supply. Not only that, says Mr. Dowsett, they do double duty by helping to shade the roof. Popping up here and there are electrical goosenecks that will eventually connect to solar-electric panels: "At one point in time, we imagine that it will be cost effective to install solar-electric," says Mr. Daniels.
Until then, green pioneer Mr. Daniels is having a blast doing nightly research into sustainable technologies with a low-cost/high-benefit ratio, and Mr. Dowsett and Mr. Egizii are busily making it all happen.
And I, your humble Architourist (who can see past the mess) will bring you the finished project some time in late 2008 or early 2009. "We're as on schedule as you can be in a renovation," finishes Mr. Daniels.

Full text:   The real-estate market has turned medium-cool lately. The mortgage crisis south of the border, a slowdown in new-home sales and general North American economic malaise have expectedly reduced the volume of buyers and sellers in the housing market. With daily reports of a semi-recession and gasoline prices reaching new highs, fewer people are looking to change their address.
The market value of home and design TV shows, meanwhile, booms away. The renovation and design genre does not require permits to make additions; most often the new shows simply appear on television and immediately connect with some segment of the viewing audience, whether on a mainstream scale ( Trading Spaces , various Martha Stewart incarnations) or to a more select viewership ( World's Greenest Homes or the curiously popular Colin and Justin's Home Heist ).
The niche category expands slightly for the launch of four new shows on HGTV, the cable mother ship of home and design television. And in a very rare occurrence, each new arrival is of Canadian origin.
The hottest new listing: The Stagers (Tuesday, HGTV at 10 p.m.) focuses on a handful of experts who transform average-looking homes into posh showroom spaces, with the express intent of driving up the price, of course. Even in the fussy TV design field, home staging is an extremely specialized craft.
"What we do does not fit into the standard equation of interior design," asserts Matthew Finlason, the wired lead stager on the Canadian-made series. "We're in the business of creating first impressions. When I do a home staging, I feel like I'm painting a beautiful picture with sofas and carpets."
However esoteric, the process apparently works: In some instances, home staging has been credited for tacking $100,000 and upward onto the asking price of a home.
Filmed in and around Vancouver, where the real-estate market seemingly remains quite healthy, The Stagers goes behind the scenes at Dekora, a design firm that has built its reputation on professional home staging. With locations in Vancouver and Calgary, the company's stockrooms are stocked to the rafters with furniture and accessories; artwork is regularly rented or borrowed from local galleries. "Each piece of art must inspire a positive emotion," Finlason says.
In each of the 13 episodes, Dekora's resident stagers - either Finlason or the combative mother-daughter team of Maureen Powers and Bridget Savereux - is allotted five days or less to spruce up a slow-moving listing. The fast turnaround naturally produces moments of high TV drama. "It can be a very intense process," says Finlason, who previously worked as a production designer and set decorator. "Besides the tight time constraints, we're always on a limited budget and usually fighting for the best lamps and sofas. Most home stagers believe they're crashing and burning on every job."
The tension is palpable in one early outing of The Stagers, in which Finlason is summoned to a sprawling Vancouver estate. With more than 8,000 square feet, the home is estimated to be in the $5-million range but has been on the market for more than a year.
As the five-day deadline looms, the situation is compounded by the presence of another hotshot stager named Jay, who has already started the job. There are immediate clashes of personal taste. "Each stager has his or her own unique style," Finlason says.
But the two creative minds eventually come together on the project and the subsequent grand unveiling results in renewed interest and a quick sale. Even when executed by committee, the home-staging concept works. "It only takes a minute for two people to fall in love with the vignette you've created," Finlason says, "and then it's game over."
Other homestyle arrivals in the week ahead: Dirty Business (Tuesday, HGTV at 8 p.m.) follows the workings of a high-end landscape design firm in Toronto. In the opening show, renowned greenery artist Joel Loblaw draws up elaborate plans to turn a dreary backyard into a stunning outdoor living space, replete with a functional patio and reading nook.
The hitch: The work crew's only access to the backyard involves tromping through the recently redesigned front yard.
Also new: The Property Shop (Wednesday, HGTV at 8 p.m.), which follows the efforts of feisty real-estate-agent-turned-broker Tatiana Londono to open her own agency in the competitive Montreal market. Her co-workers refer to Ms. Londono as "the Gordon Ramsay of real estate," which may not necessarily be intended as a compliment.
Finally, The Fix (Thursday, HGTV at 9 p.m.) brings elements of MTV's Punk'd into the design world. The format: Irreverent Brit contractors Neil Davies and Jay Purvis confer with people who believe they're getting a free makeover. They are in for a rude surprise.
The ensuing design work takes the homeowner's wishes very literally: One young Toronto couple's desire for a French country-inspired bedroom results in an over-the-top transformation - with billowing drapes, burgundy wallpaper and a massive headboard better suited to Louis XIV. The only thing missing is a stand for powdered wigs.
Once everyone has had a good laugh, and the couple recover from the shock, the cheeky TV designers wisely revert the space to their original wishes. You never know who might be a future client.

SPYING GAME
Moving from suburbia to the spy world, Alfre Woodard has joined the cast of My Own Worst Enemy . Last seen on Desperate Housewives , the Emmy-winning actress has been signed to star opposite Christian Slater in the new action-drama slated to anchor NBC's fall lineup. The premise casts Woodard as Mavis Heller, a tough lady who runs the government agency sanctioning the clandestine missions of a superspy, played by Slater. Woodard previously starred on the medical drama St. Elsewhere and spent one memorable season on Housewives in 2006.
GAME ON
CBS is expanding its plans for Million Dollar Password ; the network has announced it will order six additional episodes of the game-show remake hosted by Regis Philbin. Million Dollar Password garnered nearly 10 million U.S. viewers for each of its first four broadcasts, making it one of the few breakout hits of the early summer TV season. The original Password , which aired on CBS from 1961 to 1967, was hosted by Allen Ludden and rarely exceeded $500 in winnings; the new version boasts a grand prize of, yes, $1-million (U.S.). Celebrities appearing so far on Million Dollar Password have included Neil Patrick Harris, Steven Weber and
Rachael Ray.
MOB STORY
Devotees of The Sopranos will need to make room on the shelf for an upcoming DVD box set. Landing in stores on Nov. 11, The Sopranos: The Complete Series will feature all 86 episodes on 28 discs, though true fans of the acclaimed mob drama will probably be more drawn to the plethora of extras: The box set will feature three CDs of soundtrack music and two DVDs of bonus material, including 16 "lost" scenes, roundtable discussions with cast and writers and an interview with series creator David Chase conducted by Alec Baldwin. Weighing more than 4.5 kilograms, the package retails at $400 (U.S.).

Abstract: If Mr. [Charles Gane]'s Georgian Bay architecture reminds us of post-war America, Mr. Eslahjou's $1.2-million, 7,500-square-foot villa, slated to rise in Southern Ontario's wine-making region, recalls the stringent, elegant residential modernism of Le Corbusier in the 1920s. A series of bone-white concrete boxes, raised on a stone base and arrayed on a long axis, are penetrated by strips of black-framed windows.

Full text:   Freed from client constraints, two of the city's top architects unveil plans for their own cottage country dream homes
Ever since Victorian factories made Hogtown smoggy, right down to our post-industrial present, many Torontonians have dreamed about building perfect houses in the countryside. What such a place should look like, of course, has always been a matter of very varied opinion.
New country-seat designs currently on offer from architects around Toronto run the gamut from pompously baronial mansions and pumped-up suburban - obviously not among my first choices - to finely tuned contemporary updates of such old favourites as the Muskoka cottage and the Ontario farmhouse.
Because the taste of clients is so wide-ranging, and because designers can always be found to satisfy every yen (however dotty or downright bad), the new architecture of getaway country will always be - alas! - a schmozzle of styles.
But what happens when architects find themselves in a position to ignore the opinions of clients and make art with no one but themselves in mind? I got some interesting answers to this question last week. At the downtown Toronto offices of core architects, principals Charles Gane and Babak Eslahjou are at work on schemes for rural retreats for themselves and their families. Each man's building is different in manner and atmosphere from the other, but both are rooted firmly in the legacy of the last century's architectural avant-garde.
Which can be a problem.
When fully built out, Mr. Gane's 2,850-square-foot dwelling of stone, glass and wood will run long and low across a four-acre, exposed outcrop of mainland rock on Georgian Bay. (The $400,000 first phase of construction is expected to begin next year.) The terraced building's floor-to-ceiling glass walls are sandwiched between two horizontal slabs, though the dead-flat roofline is occasionally interrupted by massive, boxy stone chimneys, a ceiling lift over the living room and other shifts in height.
The site is tight, with a rattlesnake precinct crowding in on one side - I don't have much sympathy for these nasty creatures, but I suppose we must protect them - and a shallow marsh encroaching on the other. Despite these geographical restraints, Mr. Gane has fashioned a holiday abode with the low-slung sweep typical of modernist residential styling in Canada and the United States, circa 1950.
Is Georgian Bay ready for the summer residence of this kind? The answer you give depends on your position in a long-standing architectural quarrel.
Those who believe that all new refuges up north should always look like traditional cottages won't like this proposal. They have a point, if not a very powerful one. Long before architects began to busy themselves in escape country, local craftsmen had established a solid tradition of practical, handsome building that accorded well with the harsh climate and splendid terrain of the north - a vernacular tradition that some thoughtful latter-day architects have learned excellent lessons from.
Then there are critics - I am one of them - who argue that architects should design, everywhere and always, according to the best lights of our present age. But, here again, Mr. Gane's building does not fit. Its inspirations come from what modernism was some time ago, not what it is today: His structure brings to mind the prairie houses of Frank Lloyd Wright, and (more vividly) the mid-century California residences by Richard Neutra and Rudolph Schindler. And like these precedents, Mr. Gane's retreat is suave, urbane - too chic by half, or so it seems to me, for its delightfully savage natural surroundings.
If Mr. Gane's Georgian Bay architecture reminds us of post-war America, Mr. Eslahjou's $1.2-million, 7,500-square-foot villa, slated to rise in Southern Ontario's wine-making region, recalls the stringent, elegant residential modernism of Le Corbusier in the 1920s. A series of bone-white concrete boxes, raised on a stone base and arrayed on a long axis, are penetrated by strips of black-framed windows. A central pavilion, which separates the building's two principal volumes, is open to the elements and views on both sides.
Set down in an orchard on a 14-acre property, Mr. Eslahjou's building is intended to be a rural gathering place for his large Iranian-Canadian family, which comprises three generations.
Hence the ample appointments for luxurious relaxation by people ranging in age from patriarchs down to teenagers and infants: a pool, screening room, Turkish bath and steam room, nanny suite and party room, six bedrooms, a dining room for 14 and so on.
There is no question here of an awkward fit between house and context. Like Corbu's country homes in rural France, this highly civilized project is a good match for the old, civilized agricultural landscape round about.
We might have hoped that Mr. Eslahjou had put his energy into a more contemporary remodelling of venerable modernist country-house ideas - but never mind. As it stands, his design is a potent restatement of certain modern moves - clean, long lines, taut and unadorned solid geometry, the bold contrast between stark white walls and verdant orchards - that will probably remain stylish forever.

Full text:   Homestead Park
Location: Scarborough
BUILDER/DEVELOPER: Ballymore Homes
SIZE: 1,717 to 1,953 sq. ft.
PRICE: $269,900 to $357,900
SALES CENTRE: Homestead Drive and Lawrence Avenue. Open Monday to Wednesday, 1 p.m. to 8 p.m.; Thursday and Friday by appointment; weekends and holidays, 11 a.m. to 6 p.m.
CONTACT: Phone (416) 287-8676 or visit www.ballymorehomes.com
In the West Hill community in the east end of the city, newer single-family houses range from $400,000 to $500,000, prices that are out of reach for first-time buyers, says a local sales representative for Ballymore Homes.
As a more affordable alternative, the builder's infill project still has a handful of executive freehold townhouses left for between $269,900 and $357,900.
"It's an easy way to get into the housing market without having to be house-poor," says Mark Hansley, who runs the sales office for the development, called Homestead Park.
Furthermore, interested buyers can move in as soon as the end of this month, since construction is under way on the site at Homestead Drive and Lawrence Avenue, just east of Morningside Avenue.
The community will have 39 townhouses, six semi-detached residences and one detached house, along with sidewalks and a small park that some residences will be adjacent to.
"The majority of the homes being built are on a cul-de-sac," says Mr. Hansley. "It makes it a lot safer."
The site is next to Heron Park, a community centre and recreational facilities, as well as public schools that can be accessed via a path.
More parks can be found along the waterfront to the south.
Down the street, the Morningside Mall is being redeveloped with new stores, a Goodlife Fitness centre and a Starbucks.
"There's a little bit of everything for everyone, from first-time buyers to empty nesters, where they have the convenience of being able to walk to anything that they really need," Mr. Hansley says.
Also nearby is 24-hour bus service, a GO Transit station and Highway 401.
Two- and three-storey models will be available. Most will have 1,731 square feet with three bedrooms.
"You can fit a queen-sized bed in all three bedrooms," he says, noting that bedrooms in many newer homes have been shrinking.
Plans can be modified to incorporate a fourth or fifth bedroom, a third full bathroom upstairs or lower level family rooms with walkouts, bathrooms and fireplaces.
The main floors will have open or traditional principal rooms and eat-in kitchens with breakfast bars, pantries and rear decks, depending on the plan, Mr. Hansley adds.
Standard finishes will include imported ceramic tile floors and 35-ounce broadloom carpet.
The exteriors will display heritage-inspired brick facades with vinyl shakes, stone sills and steeply pitched roofs. Two-storey townhouses will have front garages, while three-storey units will have rear ones.

Abstract: In the case of salvaged wood you may have better luck. A lot of wood used in old buildings was large, first-growth timber of a quality that is just unavailable now. It can be very stable, with few knots, and available in larger dimensions than anything being sold today. The patina of age can add beauty to wood and add character to a project's look, whether it's flooring, cabinetry, wall panelling, or even furniture.

Full text:   Lots of things torn out in renovations aren't that old or worn, they're just not the style a new homeowner wants
I like to see used building materials from a demolition or renovation being recycled instead of seeing them hauled off to some landfill site.
I don't like waste - and the idea of tearing out good kitchen cabinets or plumbing fixtures and just tossing them into a dumpster drives me crazy.
It makes sense to recycle or reuse building materials whenever you can, and as a contractor I try to make sure anything of value that we tear out gets sent on to a reuse centre. A lot of building materials can be reused, if the contractor carefully handles the demolition part of the job.
And, if you're a homeowner on a budget, you should look into what's available at your local reuse centres, like the Habitat for Humanity's ReStore. Sometimes these centres also get surplus overstock, factory over-runs and excess inventory or end-of-lines from manufacturers that you can buy for a fraction of the usual price.
Homeowners who are renovating will tear out cabinets, sinks, toilets, bathtubs, interior doors, fireplace mantels and staircases - you name it. It's not really that old or worn, it's just not the style the new homeowner wants. And you can get those items for far less than they would cost new if you go to a reuse centre.
There are a lot of advantages to reusing old building materials. For one thing, the purchase cost will be lower than buying new off the shelf or custom. There's the environmental savings we all get from recycling. And there are also aesthetic reasons - sometimes older, weathered and worn materials can give a renovation project a special look that you can't get with new fixtures and materials.
I really like the look of reclaimed brick and stonework. A great source of used stonework is institutional buildings that have been demolished. Often they contain granite foundations, walls or stairs, finials and columns. Marble was often used in their bathrooms or flooring, which, if it was reclaimed with care, is a great find.
You need to be aware of the real differences between surplus new, used and antique before you start shopping, though. For instance, if you are buying antique windows or doors, you definitely won't have high thermal value. That's probably not a sensible idea, given the ever-climbing cost of energy. An old window might be framed in wood that's rotten. And older glass is typically single-glazed and much less energy-efficient than newer designs.
So I'd use an antique window as an interior accent, or in non-heated space like a shed or porch. A better idea if you are looking to save on windows would be search the reuse centre for surplus new models which still might be perfect for your renovation needs.
In the case of salvaged wood you may have better luck. A lot of wood used in old buildings was large, first-growth timber of a quality that is just unavailable now. It can be very stable, with few knots, and available in larger dimensions than anything being sold today. The patina of age can add beauty to wood and add character to a project's look, whether it's flooring, cabinetry, wall panelling, or even furniture. You may not be able to use salvaged lumber for anything structural, but you'd have a hard time matching the beauty of salvaged wood mouldings or fireplace mantels.
It's important to understand that not everything can be reused. For example, lead paint can make an old piece of timber a health liability. If you were to find old lighting fixtures, you'll have to take them to a professional electrician to make sure they are safe to use and wired up to current code.

Full text: Dan Brambilla is prepared to fail, but not just any old way. The chief executive of the Sony Centre, formerly the Hummingbird Centre, formerly the O'Keefe Centre, is determined to "fail successfully." And he's right on track with that.
The express train to successful failure departs today with the suddenly fashionable old house closing its doors following two summer-defining hits - sold-out concerts by Rev. Al Green and Leonard Cohen, which proved amply what Mr. Brambilla has always maintained: that there is no better place in Toronto to hear amplified music.
But that was the old Mr. Brambilla, whose only concern was success. A seasoned impresario recruited from the wreckage of Livent to return the landmark theatre to fiscal health after its anchor tenants left for the Four Seasons Centre, he did everything right, boosting sales with broadly appealing shows and driving down the big theatre's municipal subsidy to within sight of a vanishing point.
Then, fatefully, he and his board and the city councillors who suck up so many free tickets decided to think big. Lured by a vision of gold coins cascading from the mouth of a giant slot machine built on its roof, they entered an agreement with a local developer to make it real. Architect Daniel Libeskind designed the machine with an "edginess" heretofore unknown in the gaming industry.
The gulls lined up to make their bets, using mortgages instead of tokens, and the theatre shut down. Soon the jackhammers will be pounding away at its elegant limestone flank.
That's the successful part. The looming failure is the element intended to justify all the activity in the first place: A $75-million Arts and Heritage Awareness Centre built into the very mouth of the machine and spouting culture bountifully across the entire urban landscape.
The original deal called for the Sony Centre to secure $60-million in senior-government and private-sector funding for the ambitious AHA! (!) Centre by December, 2007. Now Mr. Brambilla is facing a September deadline, with no greater prospect of success than he achieved before the first one passed.
For one thing, a formerly fond city has suddenly turned its attention to a new darling: a civic museum whose proposed program essentially duplicates that of the attraction planned for the base of the Libeskind building. But the real money was supposed to come from Ottawa, and the Harper government has shown no interest in supporting new cultural projects in Toronto.
Thus the talk of successful failure. What it means is retail stores in place of the exciting attraction once promised. It means the theatre closes down indefinitely as it undergoes the excruciating pain of Libeskindation. But it also means the developer, Castlepoint Realty, will pay most of the cost of a $20-million renovation of the theatre.
Successful failure is such a Toronto thing. It brought us Harbourfront, another chronically impoverished cultural facility conceived in an orgy of real estate speculation and condemned forever to carry the stigma: those hideous high-rises. Sometimes such schemes actually succeed - viz. the National Ballet School - but more often they are crude expedients to replace necessary but unforthcoming government aid.
For the first time in its long, troubled history as an acoustically challenged opera house, the Sony Centre was on the verge of true success. It was newly buoyant, with a future promising enough to justify a $20-million renovation on its own merits. But that's all past now. The theatre is closed. Failure beckons.

Full text: It was an antidote to Toronto's sprawling housing market: a simple website created by two self-described "computer geeks" to ease their first home search, and then help a city of frazzled buyers.
That is until this week, when the Multiple Listings Service - the reigning king of online listings in Canada - unleashed its lawyer on housing123.com and banished the new kids on the block.
"It was always this overhanging axe that was ready to fall," said Travis Fielding, the 31-year-old co-founder of the website, which allowed users to search MLS listings plotted on a Google map of local neighbourhoods.
After all, MLS has crushed upstarts before. Two Toronto-based sites, Realtysellers Ltd. and Realestateplus.ca, shut down in the past two years after run-ins with the Canadian Real Estate Association, which owns the MLS trademark. Housing123.com is accused of using its information without permission.
But some industry watchers say MLS may be losing this online turf war, as what's happening in the United States may soon happen here: Sites such as Redfin, Zillow and Yahoo Real Estate now carry the lion's share of new listings, while MLS is losing ground.
They say the MLS business model - giving people only a taste of a house and directing them to an agent for more - won't stand up against competitors that will give you every detail about a house and its surroundings, including local crime stats, school reviews and previous purchase prices, along with 360 tours and a break on the commission.
"They're basically saying, 'You know what? People want to search listings themselves,' " says John Pasalis, founder of Realosophy.com, a website that dishes details about Toronto and Greater Toronto Area neighbourhoods. "The problem in Canada is we can't do this because the real-estate boards don't allow us."
Adds Mr. Fielding: "I think they're stuck in the past."
The idea for housing123.com bloomed a couple of years ago after Mr. Fielding's friend and fellow software developer, Kevin Lai, became frustrated with his own home search. Sick of navigating MLS, and frustrated by an agent who missed good houses, Mr. Lai thought he could design a better system.
On his laptop, he basically created what is known as a "Google-map mash-up," which allows people to plot customized data (in this case, MLS listings) on top of a Google map application.
It worked so well that, just for kicks, he enlisted Mr. Fielding to help him take it to the public. It took about three weeks to work out the kinks, and they developed a way for the program to automatically add new listings. "On a scale of 10, it's probably like six," Mr. Lai, 29, says of the difficulty level. For their day jobs, he and Mr. Fielding design software for financial companies.
Since the site was launched 10 months ago, it averaged about 400 to 500 unique users per day, Mr. Fielding says.
Users appreciated its simplicity. House listings appeared as dots on a map of Toronto, which users clicked on to take them to the MLS listing. Houses were colour-coded by price so users could see which areas were pricey or affordable.
By contrast, MLS has no way to narrow a search to a neighbourhood. If you're looking for a Victorian in Kensington Market, you have to search in zone C-01, which covers Yonge to Dufferin, and Bloor to the Lakefront. (That includes the Annex, the waterfront, Kensington, Little Italy, Trinity-Bellwoods, University, the downtown core, and others.)
The search engine spits out hundreds of listings, and users are stuck flipping between MLS and Mapquest.
Still, the housing123.com founders knew it would just be a matter of time before MLS came knocking, because they were using listings that were the property of MLS.ca.
Last week, Mr. Lai received a letter from a CREA lawyer saying they had violated copyright laws. Remove the site, it said, or we'll sue.
"They were scraping data from our website," says Calvin Lindberg, president of CREA, which represents more than 94,000 brokers and agents. "It's something that we deal with on a regular basis. ... Obviously whenever we see it happening, we send a letter asking them to turn it off."
Since the site folded on June 15, dozens of users have voiced their dismay on a blog, urging the duo to keep going or seek legal advice. One user wrote: "MLS is brutal and your site made finding the right place in the RIGHT location a breeze."
By the end of the summer, MLS.ca will have a map component, Mr. Lindberg says. Beyond that, he says, the site does not need to be improved. "We've created a very effective and efficient system that the consumers love."
Others disagree. One simply has to look south to see the potential for informative sites, Mr. Pasalis says. Those sites, however, have only been made possible through tough legal battles. In May, the U.S. National Association of Realtors settled its antitrust case with the Department of Justice, giving online realtors - which have been offering fees that are significantly lower than traditional realtor rates - full access to the MLS database.
Mr. Pasalis says the onus should be on Canada's Competition Bureau, not individual entrepreneurs, to fight to ensure fair competition is allowed in Canada too.
For now, Mr. Lai and Mr. Fielding say they are dreaming up new projects. "At least we helped a lot of people find their dream home," said Mr. Lai, who is now in the market for a downtown condo.
The pair say they may revive their site, but only to post properties from individual sellers or brokers - not MLS. "We can't afford the lawsuit, that's for sure," Mr. Fielding says.
Days after his site folded, Mr. Lai and his wife bid on a downtown condo they had spotted using housing123.com - but no dice. His search has resumed on MLS.ca.

Abstract: . He had his first bout with depression in grade school: "I was suicidally unhappy and I didn't think it was strange." As an adult, he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, which he controls with medication. Depression has a history in his family - his grandmother, an alcoholic, committed suicide. "It wasn't anybody's fault," he has said. "I just got the wrong genes."

Full text: After a lifetime of suicidal fixations, former Miramichi, N.B., lawyer Peter O'Neill was diagnosed with bipolar disorder seven years ago. It has cost him almost everything, writes Erin Anderssen, except a big, loyal family that knows one rule: In case of emergency, search everywhere
Thursday, April 27, 2006.
The pain has gotten too great. I don't want another round of treatment. Please pay RESP for William & Sarah and fix any other mistakes.
I lived as long as I could I just can't any more. I'm sorry.
Love, Peter
It is always there, like a song he can't stop humming. It plays in the background when he graduates from law school. When he hears "not guilty" in court. When he cheers his son William to victory in the big hockey game or hugs his daughter Sarah for winning the Grade 3 spelling bee. He left Toronto because standing on the subway platform cranked the volume. He tried to shock it out of his brain. For a time, Star Trek episodes muffled it. Drugs, at best, only dull it.
In nearly every moment of his life, Peter O'Neill thinks about killing himself. Sometimes, he makes plans. He buys rope. He sets a date. Mostly though, he is trapped between wanting to die and trying to live, while the same scenes run on a loop in his mind: a noose dangling in shadow, or his body hanging from a rope.
It has slowly drowned out nearly everything else - his marriage, his career, his family.
Peter, 43, is a father, a partner, a son and a brother, the product of a successful, loving family. In 2001, he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder. He now lives with his mother in the house where he was raised, on Station Road in Miramichi, a blue-collar town north of Moncton. His once-thriving law practice is gone. For months at a time, he barely rises from his bed. Some days, he can't greet his children when they visit. He struggles to get proper medical care in this small community.
In the spring of 1999, two years before his diagnosis, Peter handled his biggest case. Then 34, he was co-counsel for Noah Augustine, a young native leader charged with murder. Good defence lawyers are likeable by definition, and Peter, himself an up-and-comer, knew how to play to the jury, cracking well-placed jokes during tedious delays between witnesses. His beard was already silver, but there was nothing heavy about his step in the courtroom.
Along with Fredericton lawyer Gary Miller, Peter built a tricky case for self-defence and won, making national headlines.
Late that Friday night in May, when everyone else had gone home or passed out after the celebration in his mother's rambling yellow house, Peter started down the basement steps. He kept a length of rope hidden there. With the rush of the trial over, there was no mental puzzle to distract him. On cross-examinations, he likes to say, you always go out on a high note. This, he'd decided, would be his.
But something stopped him. What it was he can't say. He went back upstairs and drank alone until he fell asleep. "I stepped into the black hole and then stepped out of it again," he recalls.
It had happened before, and it would happen again.
His family works full-time to keep him safe from himself - his parents, his five siblings and his wife play their own parts in the watch. They would never call it a burden, but their lives are consumed, at times, with his illness.
"It's amazing how one person can exhaust a large group of people," says his wife, Sheila Melanson.
Mental illness lurks behind countless curtained windows in Canada, across every class and clique, and yet it remains a subject of shame. But not for the O'Neills any more.
"Our family is way beyond worrying about what people think or say," says Peter's father, Joe. There can't ever be a cure, they insist, if no one talks about the disease.
The previous day: Wednesday, April 26, 2006.
Eva MacDonald packs her bags for the Northrop Frye Festival in Moncton, which celebrates the late literary scholar in his one-time home town. Her kids, Peter included, have insisted that she go, but she is nervous about leaving her son in an empty house. As long as she is at home, Eva reasons, he won't do anything - he would worry that his mom might be the one to find him.
But she needs a few days away, without the stress that claws at her stomach every time she sees Peter's shoes are missing. She knows he isn't truly safe even when she is at home, even on the occasional night when she sits in the kitchen, pretending to read, listening for nocturnal footsteps. They still haven't spoken about the noose she found on the basement floor a few months ago. What difference would confronting him make, when the doctors can't help him?
"Some are born to sweet delight," wrote William Blake, a favourite poet of Prof. Frye's. "Some are born to endless night." Eva can quote that line by heart. She understands it better than any mother should.
Eva remembers it as a happy camping vacation in the summer of Canada's Centennial, with her six kids crammed into the family station wagon for their first trip to Prince Edward Island. On the ferry across, she was busy watching the girls, especially Jane, the youngest, who was not yet 2; the boys, Donald, 10, and Peter, 9, were allowed to wander.
She didn't learn until many years later that her younger son spent the crossing leaning over the railing with an overwhelming urge to jump into the whirlpools in the wake of the propeller. He wondered why no one else on the ferry was jumping, not understanding that this yearning set him apart from other people.
The next year, over some fight he has now forgotten, Peter cut his wrist with a razor in the upstairs bathroom at home. He didn't tell anyone.
Bad moods weren't indulged in the busy home of the O'Neills, a prominent family in what was then the town of Newcastle, now part of Miramichi. Joe worked long hours as vice-president at the pulp and paper mill. Eva, a former history teacher who stayed home to raise her kids, served as deputy mayor and organized the local folk festival. Musicians such as the Barra MacNeils and Valdy partied in their kitchen. There was hardly a school team or club without an O'Neill on the roster.
Family came first. Eva insisted that they eat together no matter what else was going on. When she and Joe split up in 1982, while Peter was away at university, they worked hard to kept communication friendly for their children's sake.
In childhood pictures, Peter is freckle-faced and jug-eared, grinning like an imp. He's not faking the smile, he says now. "It was real. I just had this other thing going on in my head."
School came easily for him. He read compulsively, even his sister's Trixie Belden serial and his mother's mystery magazines; if his sisters needed an obscure fact for a school assignment, they went to Peter. He was moody sometimes, but what teenager isn't? Back then, Eva points out, a mental illness "was probably the last thing in the world you would think of."
They knew he didn't travel with the cool crowd - that category belonged to athletes such as Peter's older brother, Donald, and his sisters. But he had nice friends, and he eventually found his niche in the drama club. His mother still has a picture of his high-school kazoo quartet; Peter was the funny guy who can't really sing. ("I was there for the underwear-outside-the-pyjamas-type stuff," Peter says.)
At the dinner table, Joe recalls, Peter was the talkative one, the mimic. "He took delight in lot of things," Joe says. Both his sons seemed to move contentedly in a house always overflowing with friends. "I don't think I saw one symptom in Peter while he was growing up that would have led me to believe he was suffering from anxiety."
Like his mom, Peter developed a keen interest in politics. In 1987, a year before starting law school, he was elected president of the Young Liberals of New Brunswick. Eva imagined him in the House of Commons one day.
But even loving, attentive parents glean only fragments: Peter has angry memories of rock-throwing bullies. He exaggerated ear infections and stomach aches so he could skip school and spend days in his mother's library. He drank and smoked pot in his teens, at first because his friends did, and then, more often, because getting drunk soothed his anxiety.
In law school at the University of New Brunswick, Peter earned a reputation for being smart but eccentric: He arrived late for class perpetually and his friend, Ross Pierce, now a lawyer in Saint John, can't recall him taking notes; instead, he would often knit a sweater in class or doodle. He once correctly answered a complex question in contracts class by quoting an episode of The Mary Tyler Moore Show . (He graduated in the middle of his class.)
"A lot of people discounted Peter's ability because he was off the wall," Mr. Pierce says. "He had his own approach to life. ... I think the world would do better with a lot more Peters."
Peter had a knack for reading personalities, Mr. Pierce says, and for deflating people who didn't like him with a sharp quip. "If you put Peter in a room with 100 people, within an hour, he could give you a very good sense of who those 100 people were." Female classmates confided in him after breakups.
Mental illness hides itself well behind plausible excuses - quirkiness, stress, too much drinking. His parents missed it. His sisters told themselves he'd get over it. And close as they were, Mr. Pierce didn't suspect there was anything wrong. Even a few years later, when Peter started phoning him in the middle of the night, he figured that his friend was just going through a hard time.
Laughter was always Peter's cover - it still is, when he has the energy to pull it off. In those moments, there's a flicker of the witty personality that Mr. Pierce recalls so fondly.
"When I was 10 and I slit my wrists, I also wanted to be prime minister," Peter says one day between smokes. "How do you get to be that and be nuts?" He lifts an eyebrow, waits a beat: "It's probably not that hard. We've had some loonies."
He manages a smile.
Wednesday night, April 26, 2006.
Joe O'Neill watches a smiling Peter relax with his family. Joe has driven two hours from Fredericton to the Miramichi to visit, and proposed dinner out with Sheila and the kids. "My treat," he added - unnecessarily, since Peter has no way to cover the cheque.
On the drive, Sarah, 6, made the case for Dixie Lee, a favourite of her dad's. William, 8, wanted Chinese. They compromised by buying Sarah her chicken to go, so she could eat it while they had egg rolls and fried rice at Tran's Palace. While the kids argue now over whose meal is better, Joe glances at his son. He is dressed in a clean, pressed shirt, his hair combed. That alone is enough to make his father happy. But Peter is also cracking jokes and making Sheila smile. He is listening to his children tell stories about school. Joe can't remember a better night.
After they drop Sheila and the kids at their home, he says to Peter, "Boy, I really enjoyed this evening. The kids were happy and Sheila was glowing." He gives his son a hug, and drives a couple blocks across town to sleep in his daughter Sally's spare bedroom. "I'll be back in the morning," he tells Peter, before heading home.
"I suppose," Peter's brother, Donald, says now, "we had it all along."
Mental illness runs in families and strikes at will. Out of six O'Neill children, it caught two - both of the boys.
Donald was living in Alberta when he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder in 1997, four years before Peter. Eva (who had flown out to help with Donald's increasingly bizarre behaviour) called the police after he began predicting that he was going to die on Good Friday.
Though only a year apart in age, the two brothers share little else, besides a diagnosis. Growing up, Donald was the all-round jock to Peter's artsy bookworm. Donald had graduated from university, moved west and married by the time Peter went home to New Brunswick to open his law practice. They spoke occasionally by phone, but didn't see each other much.
Scientists believe that bipolar disorder may result from genes either inherited or changed during conception that produce faulty proteins; the proteins then interrupt or misdirect certain brain activities, causing the extreme mood swings that define the condition. Stress or traumatic events aren't enough on their own to set the disease in motion, but they are believed to be potential triggers for a person carrying the right switch in their brains.
Joe and Eva's children happen to be remarkably strong swimmers in the genetic pool. Two of Peter's sisters also became lawyers: Mary, who followed her brother as president of the young Liberals, is currently on leave as assistant clerk with the Privy Council Office; Jane, who clerked with the Supreme Court of Canada, is a partner in a Halifax firm. Ann is a popular English high-school teacher recently promoted to a job with the Miramichi school board. Sally, after working as Peter's legal secretary while raising her family, has gone back to school to study business administration.
But there's a genetic snag hidden somewhere. Like many families, they don't talk about it much, but the siblings all heard whispers about a troubled young uncle who died before they were born. They had a cousin who killed himself.
Donald and Peter share traits common to bipolar patients - mood swings, excessive drinking, financial ruin. But while their disease is defined by two poles, they tend towards opposite ends: Peter, in his highest mania, has never thought that he was Jesus; Donald isn't suicidal. While the disease mostly slows down Peter's life, it speeds up Donald's.
Donald's wife works in the oil industry, while he usually buys the groceries and looks after his son. But on certain days, he will explain with intensifying conviction how he knows that Terry Fox is going to come back to life, finish his run and receive the Stanley Cup. His family struggles to find the right mix of drugs to pull him down again.
When they are both manic, the two brothers can talk for long hours on the phone about theories and business plans. After Donald sent Peter a copy of Stephen Hawking's A Brief History of Time , Peter became obsessed with his own "cluster theory"; in the hospital last year, he spent weeks filling white boards with math calculations.
"I thought I had solved something," Peter says, "and nobody wanted to talk about it."
Except his brother, who admits: "Sometimes we are our own worst enemies."
In the weeks after Donald was first admitted to hospital and diagnosed, most of the family, including Peter, travelled from the East Coast to offer support.
"I know how you feel," Donald remembers Peter telling him. "It's like the razor's edge. You walk the fine line. You never know when you're going to slip and cut yourself in two."
Thursday morning, April 27, 2006, 8:30 a.m.
Peter answers the door already showered and dressed. That's odd, Joe thinks, but maybe Peter is finally having a run of healthy days. "Where are you going?" he asks. Errands downtown, Peter says. An offer of a ride is declined, and Joel feels a leap of uneasiness: Peter never walks, because it leaves his mind free to wander - always to the same place. He would use his last few dollars to take a cab two blocks.
"I've got a few things to do for mom," Peter explains. "Clean the kitchen, vacuum, a few things like that. I'll take my time." But Peter rarely does housework, even when his sisters and Sheila bug him to help his mother out more. It was Eva who made the beds and folded the laundry.
Something's up, Joe thinks, as he drives downhill toward the river to get his newspaper. As he's rooting for change at the Irving gas station, he glances up and sees Peter across the street. Ten minutes has passed since they spoke. "Don't be nosy," he tells himself.
But Joe can't help it. He parks the car on Pleasant Street, losing Peter around the government building. Joe spots him again, heading into the liquor store, leaving with a bag. "That's a bad sign," he thinks. It is barely past 9 a.m. Peter stops at Sobeys. Not wanting his son to see him spying, Joe circles the block and misses Peter coming out of the store. He drives back to the house. No one is there. Joe starts to panic. He replays last night's dinner in his mind: Did he miss the truth, wanting so much for his son to have a taste of happiness?
It's time to get Ann.
One Christmas Eve, home from university, Ann woke to someone banging on her bedroom door at 4 in the morning. She found Peter standing in the hallway, with a sheet around his neck. "He wanted me to stop him from going over the banister," she says. She made him lie down, on the side of the bed away from the door, so he couldn't sneak out again, and lay awake with him while he cried.
They didn't talk about it the next day, but a week later, Peter told her that he was going to see a doctor. "I said okay," Ann recalls. "And that was it."
Of course, it was only the beginning. The physician prescribed anti-depressants, which didn't work. Peter got busy and didn't keep his second appointment. He was still drinking heavily, his sisters knew: At parties, he told jokes long past the point of being funny. Sometimes he would be mean. Often he would weep before passing out.
"You could feel the depression coming from him" says Ann, who started to avoid him. "You knew the night would end kind of shitty."
But they also knew Peter had cause to be sad. He had broken up with a long-time girlfriend. And his best friend, Bob Melanson, had been diagnosed with cancer for the second time; he and Bob had been inseparable since junior high. Two years later, Peter was standing by his bedside when Bob passed away. He would grieve, everyone thought, and get better.
When he opened his law practice in Miramichi in 1993, Sally went to work for him, setting her new baby up in a playpen in the corner of the office. They handled mostly criminal cases and real estate. The practice was busy: Even on the morning that Bob died, Peter went to work on time.
But Sally and Peter have always been close, and she saw that sometimes he could barely lift his head from the desk. On the worst days, she would take documents to his house and find him lying in bed, his expression vacant.
She covered for him, making excuses for his absence, keeping the files organized, ensuring that the right documents were signed. Her brother could still shake it off and be lively and focused once a client stepped through the office door.
Other mornings, she would arrive at the office to discover that he had stayed there working all night. He was often at his best in the courtroom at such times. But Sally began to recognize the signs of what she now knows as mania. He would churn out words that didn't always make sense, rarely sleep, dash in and out of the office. "You couldn't even talk to him. He'd be there for 10 seconds and leave."
Toward the fall of 2001, with the finances of his law practice in disarray, he began rambling about business ventures - a new high-speed satellite system, a radical reform of the province's land registry. In one week, he made two overnight trips to Ottawa in his old Dodge Ram truck. At the time, he was helping the local native reserve with a fishing dispute. He camped out for 12 hours in a Halifax hotel lobby, rumpled and twitchy, insisting on a meeting with national native leadership.
"We didn't put all the pieces together," Joe says.
For the person experiencing mania, what seems like mental clarity can be euphoric. "There is nothing better," Peter says. "Depression kills the inside of the person inflicted. Mania kills the outside - everyone else."
He shared his ideas with everyone he met, sometimes distributing documents at random, stringing together disjointed sentences. It was like believing you've made a discovery that will save the world but finding no one would listen.
"I was upset that everybody thought that everything I did was wrong," he says, shuffling even now between acceptance and frustration. "Nobody wanted to talk about it. They just thought I was crazy."
Sally worried she might find him dead in the bathroom at his office one night; Ann refused to risk Sally making the discovery on her own. Around this time, Sally and Ann began a routine that has continued ever since: Whenever Peter goes missing, even for a few hours, they track him down, often leaving their husbands to watch the children. They have a route - the office, the pubs, his AA meeting, the old haunts. Once they find him, Sally often takes Peter home to watch over him.
They have become experts on his moods: When he is depressed, he is usually too unmotivated to be a risk to himself. But over months, his anxiety can build into mania. Then his sisters might take turns calling their mom's place a half-dozen times a night: If he's sleeping, he's safe. He phones them, too, over and over again, speaking only for a couple minutes.
"Lonely tonight, Pete?" Ann will say.
"A little," he answers.
Or: "Are you going to do it tonight?" Sally asks.
"No," he sighs, "not tonight."
They always answer. They go when he needs them.
"We would run right now," Ann says, sitting with Sally at her kitchen table. "In two seconds."
Peter is their brother. It's as simple as that. And all the sisters help as they are able. "Everybody is just doing the best they can in the moment they are doing it," Jane says.
Jane, in Halifax, and Mary, who lives in Ottawa, have the advantage of distance: They step in when the family members on the ground are exhausted. During an early stay in the hospital, Mary sent Peter a fax, listing all the reasons he had to live: "You throw in the kitchen sink, anything that you think might strike a chord just to give him one more day."
Mary and Jane often take the lead in actively pursuing new treatment options. With an outside perspective, they are less likely to coddle Peter; they worry more about the toll it is taking on their aging parents and the rest of their family.
This past Christmas, Peter drank too much at Sheila's and she had to call the family for help. Jane, who was visiting, saw the stress in her sisters' faces and the weariness in her mother, who would likely be sitting up nights during the holidays on perpetual suicide watch. She sat Peter down.
"Look around, you will be the last person standing if you keep this up," Jane told him. "You've got to pretend yourself into a life. Just go through the motions of treating people with respect."
It's not easy, not for him or for them. A few years ago, Ann couldn't sleep at night; she was having nightmares about Peter's funeral. The rest of the family pulled her out of it. That's how they manage.
"We are never on our own," Ann says. "Ever."
Thursday, April 26, 2006,
10 a.m.
Ann is in a staff meeting at Harkins Middle School when Joe knocks on the office door. He often stops by when he's in town. But today she is startled by his expression. Her father is the calm one: She has never seen him look so scared.
"I can't find Peter," he says.
She leaves the meeting without explaining why. It is her idea to go back home and look for the journal. Peter never hides it. He's too honest and open. She finds the black, hardcover book in the living, and flips through the pages, scanning the dates. There it is, written in Peter's sloping scrawl: "The pain has gotten too great. ... I'm sorry."
Joe realizes that he had it all wrong. Peter wasn't feeling better at dinner last night. He was saying goodbye. And he wasn't leaving the government building. He was coming from the hardware store next door, with rope.
Joe punches a number into the phone. "Sally," he says. "This is the day."
Sally is there in minutes, pulling up in her blue van. They stop at the police station and every available squad car joins the search. They check the local bars, Bob Melanson's grave, even the old family camp. Police officers wade into the waters under the Morrissey Bridge.
They drive to Sheila's to tell her Peter is missing. Can she think where he might be? Sheila calls the school to see if he has turned up to see the kids, and to alert the office staff to watch for him. She rushes to her own car, and drives aimlessly, frazzled with panic.
And then, for the first time, she stops herself. I cannot do this any more, she thinks. She parks the car at home and waits in her living room. The phone rings again and again, but she doesn't answer .
Sheila Melanson knows there is talk in Miramichi about how she "got rid of Pete because he was crazy." Some people, older women especially, think that it's no different than if she had showed her husband the door for having cancer - but you can still talk to the person who has cancer, she says. At first she tried to explain her decision. Now she doesn't bother.
"Everything was just consumed by him. It was all about him. I had to say, 'Enough.' " She stops herself and adds softly: "Now I sound really cold."
Sheila, 41, has known Peter for most of her life; she was Bob Melanson's sister, and their parents were friends with the O'Neills. They never married formally, but she and Peter moved in together in 1997 and William was born the following year; Sarah, two years later. Shortly after William's birth, Peter ended up in the hospital briefly. But in those days, Sheila assumed that his low spells were brought on by the stress of running a law practice. When Peter gushed about the waterfront home they would buy eventually, or the business deal that would make them rich, she was swept up in it. He was a smart man, she loved him and, even manic, he could sound convincing.
But in reality their lives were unravelling. While Sheila settled into raising a family, Peter continued drinking. She never knew which Peter she was going to find at home each night. Sometimes, he lay comatose on the couch, the house a mess, and she would stay up cleaning for hours after the kids were in bed. She found legal papers strewn around. When clients phoned at night, she could hear him babbling nonsense at them over the phone; during some calls, he fell asleep while they were still talking.
In 2001, Peter crashed. The bank stopped cashing his cheques and his father, realizing that his business schemes were hiding a more serious problem, refused to bail him out. His practice soon closed; his clients were given to other lawyers and he declared bankruptcy. On Oct. 11, his birthday, he was admitted voluntarily for a six-month stay in the psychiatric unit at Fredericton's Dr. Everett Chalmers Hospital. He couldn't hide it any more.
Sheila tried for two more years: She took over the bills and worked long shifts at a call centre to support them. (He worked there sometimes too, on and off.) She was embarrassed to ask her mother to babysit, but she wasn't sure she could trust Peter to watch William and Sarah. He would never hurt them, she knew, but he might leave a pot on the stove or fall asleep. Other times, he would disappear without telling her - and then she would exhaust herself with worry about where he might be.
On his manic days, she watched Peter leave with his briefcase in the morning, talking hurriedly about meetings and documents, and she knew it was mostly in his head. "He looks good, he's got the $1,000 suit on ... and it would all be a show."
During those times, she couldn't talk to him. "He would find something to focus on and go with it 100 per cent, at the expense of everything."
They rarely fought, except when he was drinking. But one night three years ago, she told him, "Pete, I am sorry, you can't stay here any more."
He moved down to Eva's, where William and Sarah sleep over a couple nights a week. Sheila started locking her house to make sure he couldn't come in while she was at work.
"I could finally get on track and have some stability," she says.
Peter understands her decision: "It was hard for her, but it needed to be done," he says now. "You get wrapped up in what is going on inside you. It is sometimes hard - not impossible - but sometimes hard to see your effect on other people. I love Sheila and she loves me. We have a pretty good family. We do stuff together. We have a bit of a buffer and that seems to work well for us."
But even after Peter moved out, Sheila stressed about the burden Eva was now carrying and what would happen after Eva was gone. She saw how Peter's support circle grew smaller, as their friends drifted away. She had to tell her own mother to stop driving Peter around, sometimes five or six times a day. She felt uneasy about him taking the kids home from daycare, though she had no official reason to prevent it.
"I became the nut," she says. "I became manic."
So she has set boundaries: She doesn't visit him in the hospital or follow every detail of his treatment.
It has been hard on the kids. When Peter is doing well, he cooks them dinner at Eva's and helps with homework, catches up with them during their afternoon sitcoms. He takes William to hockey and watches Sarah's gymnastics class. His love for them is not in doubt: His journal entries are filled with concern for their future. His family is unanimous: "Peter stays alive for his kids."
But for long spells, he can't muster the energy for parenting. He sleeps on the couch. They watch television in hushed silence and Grandma handles supper.
"Why doesn't dad live here any more?" William asked Sheila, in the beginning.
"We fight too much," she would say. Finally, when they got old enough, she sat them down and explained it as best she could.
Now, when asked, William shrugs: "Sometimes, he's going really fast, and sometimes he's really, really slow."
Sheila has trouble at times seeing Peter's condition as a disease he can't control - "I think I'm there," she wavers - and finds it hard not to feel angry that he doesn't try harder to help himself. "Peter is looking for a magic pill."
Still, some mornings he brings her Tim Hortons coffee the way she likes it. She once woke to see him sprinkling salt on her driveway after an ice storm. For those small offerings, she is grateful. She occasionally invites him out to breakfast with the kids. They attend school concerts together and spend holidays as a family. But, in her eyes, he is not a partner any more.
She used to think their new living arrangement would be temporary. Wishful thinking, she calls it now.
Thursday, April 26, 2006, noon.
In his sister's shed, Peter O'Neill has chugged two pints of peach schnapps and is now working his way through a 40-ouncer lifted from his brother-in-law's liquor cabinet. He didn't plan to use Ann's shed: He has left a quick note of apology on her kitchen counter. But his father was parked at home when the cab went by and Ann conveniently lives one street over.
The rope is tied and slung over a rafter. He is drinking to dull the jitters. He wants to feel calm but the alcohol isn't working. The rope he'd planned to use was thicker and softer, but his mom found it in the basement and threw it out. He has been here before, standing at the edge, with a noose ready to slip around his neck. But this day is different. It's not death that's stopping him. He's worried about those last moments as the noose tightens. "This is going to hurt," he thinks. And takes another swig.
On a Thursday morning this April, at the house on Station Road, Peter slouches in a wooden chair at the kitchen table, while his mom eyes her bread, rising in the oven. The conversation turns to the many times his family has insisted that he go to the local hospital - voluntarily or not.
"What are you going to do?" Eva shrugs. "He has to be in there to be safe for a while."
"Well," Peter corrects her, "the people around me thought I had to be in there. And any time they ever asked me to go, I always went."
"A couple times, you had to be rounded up," Eva says.
"Mostly, I went."
This is the pattern: When Peter's anxiety rises, his family often decides he is safer in "the bin," as his sisters call it - less likely to find the means to hurt himself. Contrary to what Peter says, it is not always easy to persuade him to go. Sometimes they gang up on him until he agrees. On occasion, they have called the police to take him.
"It's like getting in front of a train," Joe says. "He would run over anybody that got in front of him. His mind is going too fast, so rapid everything is impaired. And those are the times we worry the most."
A few years ago, Peter tried to reopen his practice; he lasted two weeks before anxiety consumed him and his family admitted him to the hospital. Sometimes the hospital turns him away when he isn't sick enough. But the O'Neills can't always be sure.
Nobody expects him to come out cured, certainly not from the psych ward of the Miramichi Regional Hospital where, Peter says, the nurses spend their days filling charts behind the window of their station and his best conversations are with Doris, the cleaning lady. To get out sooner, he plays along, painting birdhouses and enduring The Jerry Springer Show in the common room.
"You might as well take me to the Nelson dump," he tells his family.
At least he's still alive to crack jokes, they think.
The trouble is, nothing works. Peter has tried more than a dozen different medications, doses and combinations. He took eight courses of electroconvulsive treatment in 2002, which worked temporarily but cost him some short-term memory. (He did get a recurring gag out of it: "Who's that?" he asked, pointing to his mom, after emerging from one session.) If he leaves the hospital with an "improved" mood, it doesn't last.
His family has become disillusioned with the health-care system. "Doctors have two minutes to talk and one minute to write a prescription," Joe says.
In all this time, Ann points out, not one doctor has really sat down with the family and explained how bipolar works, or advised them on how to help. What they know, they have learned on their own. They feel frustrated that someone like Peter, who follows his doctor's orders and has the support of his family, cannot have a better result.
"It's just so sad," Ann says during the conversation at her kitchen table. "It's not fair that someone should have to feel like that all the time.
"You shouldn't have to commit suicide by yourself," Sally adds, "just to make it stop."
In the winter of 2007, after e-mails from the family members in Miramichi became increasingly desperate, Mary persuaded Peter to come to Ottawa for a visit. With the help of a doctor friend, she arranged to have him committed to the Royal Ottawa Hospital. "Everyone felt it was the last stop," she explains.
There, for the first time, Peter says, he felt he received real help. Nobody forced him to do crafts; they let him talk about his cluster theory and anything else on his mind. For two weeks, he scribbled diagrams on a white board. Even the language was different. At the Royal Ottawa, he wasn't a patient or a consumer: He was a person.
"It was an absolutely mind-blowing experience," he says. "Instead of checking off boxes, they asked me what I thought I was doing in their hospital."
Every day, he talked to the nurses and he met regularly with a psychiatrist.
"I looked at some of the reports that went from Fredericton to Ottawa, and one of them said, 'He walked for weeks, lost in his own thoughts.' Well, nobody talked to me." (He doesn't blame the hospital staff in New Brunswick - he knows that they are overburdened.)
Three months into treatment, however, a homesick Peter decided to head back east. His family tried to persuade him to stay in Ottawa, but he missed his children, and he said he felt better.
At home, he started volunteering, teaching a local man to read. He spoke publicly for the first time about his illness.
But he still slipped: In November, with his anxiety rising, his father drove him to the Miramichi hospital to be admitted.
"As Peter goes, we all go, in a fashion," Joe says. "You have to watch, because you care so much, that you don't fall into the pit."
They are not complaining. Many families face worse circumstances, with far fewer resources, he says. "We don't go around feeling bad because we have this great big load. We just lift it and share it."
Thursday, April 26, 2006,
1:30 p.m.
Sergeant Merle Campbell charges into the pool shed. They have tracked the cab and found the note on the kitchen counter: "I know how shitty this is," Peter has written. "The pain was just too much, like cancer."
Sgt. Campbell has been here before; in his three decades on the force, he has seen more than his share of suicides. But this one is different: He knows Peter, whose sister Ann is best friends with Sgt. Campbell's wife. He tries to clear his mind, to be "frosty." Please God, he thinks, let him be alive, or help me to bring him back.
He finds Peter lying on a flattened cardboard box, the rope ready, the chair in place. "Peter O'Neill," Sgt. Campbell exhales, grabbing hold of him. "Am I glad to see you."
Peter looks at the flush of fear on the officer's face and says: "I'll go with you, Merle. Don't worry, I'll go with you."
Following procedure, Peter is handcuffed and seated in the back of the cruiser. Sgt. Campbell takes the seat beside him. They talk all the way to the hospital, Peter apologizing, Sgt. Campbell consoling.
"We're going get you through this," he tells Peter. "It's not your time."
Last month, a man the O'Neills knew in Miramichi committed suicide. "I cannot feel sorry for him," Peter told Eva. "He's at peace."
And while Peter clings to his own version of peace, his family watches for signs that he is slipping: heightened anxiety over small problems, too many phone calls. A couple of weeks ago, he told his father, "I am sick and tired of hiding the fact that I know everything."
It was a passing comment on the telephone, but Joe knows; "He is on shaky ground."
For the most part, Peter and his mom have become comfortable roommates. She stocks the fridge and cooks most meals, even though they don't officially eat together unless William and Sarah are there. Eva handles the laundry and, in the morning, she'll make Peter's bed along with her own, if he forgets.
During the day, Peter takes to the couch and the TV in the living room; Eva's domain is the kitchen, where she watches Coronation Street on an old 14-inch TV and, not coincidentally, can also track Peter's comings and goings. On bad days, if he gets up at all, it is mostly to smoke on the porch; the more stubs in the can, the rougher the day. At 69, Eva has lost hearing in one ear; she sleeps on the good one to muffle the noise from the television in Peter's bedroom, which stays on to help him sleep.
Some days, neither one of them leaves the house much. Since that day in April, Eva is afraid to go away overnight; at most, she takes the morning train to Moncton, has lunch in a pub with friends and catches the last train home that night. To keep busy, she bakes for the funerals at church.
Peter knows what the disease does to everyone around him, but he is not strong enough to prevent it from happening. To get him out more, Donald and his wife recently bought Peter a car (they cover the gas and the repairs). And he is trying to make a difference: He now sits on the board of the Centre for Independent Living in town, where he has brought other people with mental illness together for a weekly support group.
"Peter is much more than he thinks he is," says Tracey Matchett, the centre's executive director. "He always says mental illness is a selfish disease. But it takes a really strong, giving person to speak out like he's doing."
He has organized information for local medical staff about the Royal Ottawa Hospital's approach to treatment and continues to accepts speaking engagements to raise awareness.
"The biggest thing that we can do," he says, "is to take mental illness out of the hospitals, take it out of the clinics, take it out of the homes where it has been hidden and bring it out into the community, so that we can deal with it."
And he holds on to the hope that he will get better and the life he wanted will be returned to him. His dreams, when he remembers them, are about being in the courtroom again, in his lawyer's robes, mesmerizing a jury. Awake, he wants more simply to be a good father to his children.
"People have problems," he says. "Whether they have a mental illness or not. Sometimes you get shipwrecked. Sometimes you don't."
Meanwhile, at his mother's house, they are making renovations. In the kitchen, Eva chose new wallpaper, of red apples bigger than your hand checkerboarded against a white background. She wanted something cheerful.
It's the same with the books that lie in tippy stacks on every flat surface in the house: She always reads the last page first, to guarantee a happy ending.
"I've had enough sadness," she says.
Thursday, April 26, 2006,
evening.
That night, Joe, Ann and Sally go out for dinner. Maybe, one of them jokes, they should post Peter's picture at the hardware store: "Don't Sell Rope to This Man."
They laugh. Anyone listening would think they were crazy.
They got lucky: Peter is safe. For now, as Joe puts it, they have changed the day.
"Do you know why it's worth it?" Ann will say, looking back. "Because you love your family, and you love your brother. ... Some days you want to boot him in the arse. But that's just part of being a family."
And you don't give up on that.

IS THE TIDAL MODEL A BETTER WAY?
During one of his stays in the psychiatric unit of the Miramichi Regional Hospital, Peter O'Neill signed up for the meal-planning group, hoping it would count towards earlier release. He was picked up in a van to buy chili ingredients at Sobeys. "They let me hold the money - that was a big thing - and carry the list," he says. Then they followed him down the aisle like an entourage - the blind occupational therapist, her black lab, her helper and a student who happened to be training that day.
"Here I was with a grocery cart, and this circus trailing behind me, as I met everybody I ever knew in Newcastle and represented in court, or went to high school with." He laughs. They might as well have taped a sign to his back: "Crazy man walking."
It wasn't until he went for treatment last year at the Royal Ottawa Hospital that Peter felt treated like a person struggling with a disease, rather than a client to be processed.
The Royal Ottawa was the first psychiatric facility in North America to adopt the Tidal Model, its name a metaphor to make the point that recovery from mental illness is a fluid and individual process with ups and downs over time. Now, hospitals in Halifax and Calgary are also trying the new treatment philosophy designed to improve communication, build unique treatment plans and allow patients a bigger role in their care.
At the Royal Ottawa, those receiving treatment are no longer called patients or consumers, but "people in care." The admission interview once required nurses to ask dozens of question on first meeting, ranging from: "Have you ever been the victim of sexual abuse?" to "If you found a stamp addressed envelope on the ground, what would you do?" Now, nurses sit down with new patients and ask them to tell their own stories, how they ended up at the facility and what they want out of treatment.
The people in care are allowed to see their charts, no longer requiring a doctor's permission. They meet each day with a nurse to set their goals and are not pushed to participate in crafts or other programs unless its suits their interests or treatment - no more aimlessly building birdhouses. Their opinions, usually in their own words, are included in clinical meetings about their care.
The Tidal Model has been shown in research to shorten hospital stays and improve participation in therapy. Used in more than 100 medical facilities around the world from Japan to Denmark, it was developed by Phil Barker, Britain's first professor of psychiatric nursing, and his wife, Poppy Buchanan-Barker, a social worker.
"If you are really going to treat someone, you can't be in the fish bowl of the nursing station," says Lisa Murata, clinical nurse educator at the Royal Ottawa. "[This program] demands that you listen to a person's story. They are the experts in their own lives."

The basics
Bipolar disorder - once known as manic depression - is a medical condition identified by extreme mood swings that can last from hours to months. Symptoms often begin to show between the ages of 18 and 24, but the pattern of illness differs. Some people experience long spells of depression, with short peaks of manic behaviour. Others have longer periods of mania, which typically includes rapid speech, sleeplessness, overspending and other high-risk behaviours.

Robert Munsch : 63, author of such bestselling children's books as Love You Forever and Paper Bag Princess . He had his first bout with depression in grade school: "I was suicidally unhappy and I didn't think it was strange." As an adult, he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder, which he controls with medication. Depression has a history in his family - his grandmother, an alcoholic, committed suicide. "It wasn't anybody's fault," he has said. "I just got the wrong genes."
Robert Campeau : 84, real-estate developer. Mr. Campeau's admission in the 1990s that he suffers from bipolar disorder came as several other high-profile business people were acknowledging their struggles with the illness; it was dubbed "the CEO's disease." Known for his lavish lifestyle, he made headlines when his fortune collapsed in that decade's recession. A comeback deal to rebuild his business also fell apart. In 2000, he returned from Europe to seek treatment for depression in Canada.
Barrett Robbins : 34, former NFL star lineman. On the eve of the 2003 Super Bowl game, the Oakland Raiders player suffered a breakdown, and spent game day under suicide watch in hospital while his team lost. With his career gone, his life fell apart: In 2005, he was charged with attempted murder after a confrontation with police, for which he received five years probation.
Buzz Aldrin : 78, former astronaut. Overwhelmed by his sudden fame after joining Neil Armstrong as the first men to walk on the moon, Mr. Aldrin struggled with depression and alcoholism for years, going in and out of treatment. Both his mother and father committed suicide. Speaking this winter to promote a housing project in Florida for homeless people with mental illness, he referred to his recovery as "a never-ending process."
J.K. Rowling : 42, Harry Potter author. In March, Ms. Rowling revealed that she battled depression after separating from her first husband, and considered killing herself. "We're talking suicidal thoughts, here, we're not talking 'I'm a little bit miserable," she said. Sent away with no help after her first appointment with a doctor, she was eventually prescribed cognitive behavioural therapy. Far from ashamed, she says, "I went through a really rough time and I am quite proud that I got out of that."

Full text: Despite the band's recent financial gains, some families still live in mouldy homes with leaky roofs
Mike Sparrow moved out of his home on the Musqueam Indian band reserve in south Vancouver 10 months ago after his daughter was born. Splotchy black-and-white spots of mould had spread over the ceiling and walls of his partly renovated home. He did not have the money to do the repairs, and he said he could not persuade the band to help him. He found an apartment nearby for his family.
"With a new kid, I did not want to bring her in here," Mr. Sparrow, a 38-year-old unemployed commercial fisherman, said as he walked through his abandoned home. "I did not want to chance anything. She's a baby and I did not want to put her into these kind of conditions."
Several families on the urban reserve on the banks of the Fraser River still live in homes with furry mould and blue tarps patching leaky roofs. An informal tour of the reserve this week with Mr. Sparrow and other band members went by the home of a 70-year-old elder, who they said had to live in the basement because the roof leaked and the main-floor walls were mouldy.
A 1984 Oldsmobile, a 1976 Malibu, two fishing boats and other derelict vehicles sat on a residential property on the reserve, next to a motor home and a trailer. Leslie Guerin, a 44-year-old status Indian who was born on the reserve, lives with his wife under a blue tarp thrown over the space between the motor home and trailer.
He has been living there without running water, heat or power since 2003. Mr. Guerin said in an interview yesterday that he goes to a community centre nearby to shower and brush his teeth. He has asked for a hydro hookup to a power line that runs outside his trailer, but he says the band council told him the cost was prohibitive. He appealed to the federal government for help, but was told the band was responsible for services on the reserve. He said he intends to stay in his makeshift housing and press for services.
Substandard housing in remote native reserves and associated respiratory problems for the young, the sickly and the elderly have been widely reported in Canada for years.
However, the desperate conditions on the Musqueam reserve are unlike anything else.
The Musqueam band is one of Canada's wealthiest aboriginal groups, with land holdings that Vancouver realtors estimate would be worth hundreds of millions of dollars if they were developed. Much of the land has been acquired in recent months. But even before land-claim settlements ballooned their real estate holdings, the band was well off. It received about $4-million last year from leases on its land, housing rentals and other sources, the band's audited financial statement shows.
Yet the Musqueam band and its members also received $6-million in government support, including $1-million in income assistance and social-support payments. The band's holding company last year had an accumulated deficit of $17.6-million. Residents who work at a local grocery store take home food that is on the verge of spoiling and can't be sold, a band member said.
The band is not as rich as some may believe, Jordan Point, a member of the Musqueam band council, said in an interview. "It is not a poor place, but you have to look at the reality of any situation," he said. "There are constraints and it is not as it appears in the first place."
STATSCAN SAYS
The reserve, between the equestrian estates of the Southlands neighbourhood and the University of British Columbia, is home to 610 status Indians, including 150 children under 15 years old. More than 700 non-aboriginal people also live on the reserve.
The 2006 Statistics Canada survey found that the Musqueam are worse off than most other native groups in B.C. The median income for Musqueam band members was $10,678, compared to $15,836 for aboriginal people across B.C. The median household income was $35,805, compared to $42,059 province-wide.
Housing on the reserve reflects the peculiar juxtaposition of money and poverty. The reserve - with homes stretching along its half-dozen or so streets - has its own enclaves. Well-maintained housing that would fit into any middle-class neighbourhood is near the band office. Older homes with tarps on the roof are at the far end of the community. Well-tended houses on some streets are right next door to homes in desperate need of repair.
Statistics Canada says 85 of the 200 homes occupied by status Indians on the reserve require major repairs. Mr. Point said the band's waiting list for housing has 200 names.
He says people should be "more vigilant" in maintaining their homes. "We hope people would be pro-active," Mr. Point said, adding that the band council wants to help those truly in need but is trying to help develop a thriving, self-reliant community.
He said he had heard of one person who had to vacate his home as a result of mould, but he was not aware of anyone who was living on the reserve without heat or water.
The band has recently spent $1.9-million on new roads, sewers and other municipal utilities for 40 new lots where houses will soon be built, he said. However, paying for new housing for all who need it would cost the band $40-million, he added. The council is considering different plans for financing new homes and social housing.
Tensions between two groups on the reserve boiled over this week, with several members closing down the band's administration centre. The division in the community surfaced last December, when a group of band members, many of whom live in the mouldy homes, tried to have the annual Christmas payout from their business holdings increased to $1,000 from $250.
The group had heard that the B.C. government had agreed to give the band $20-million in an out-of-court land-claims settlement. They wanted to be involved in how the money was distributed. However, the band council told the group that the money had not yet been paid out, members of council and the dissident band members said in interviews this week.
The province transferred $5-million in mid-March and $15.3-million in mid-April. However, council members still were not ready to tell the dissident group how the money would be spent. In addition, the federal government earlier this month announced a transfer of $17-million to the Musqueam, no strings attached, in recognition of their claim over lands that will be used during the 2010 Olympics.
Mr. Point said the band council has been involved in a "long-term strategic planning process" to examine ways to use the federal and provincial money most effectively, and have discussed plans for the next 20 to 50 years. They will share information with band members at a community meeting on Monday, and at a later date, there will be a vote on how the money will be dispensed.
He said he has urged the dissident band members to work within the established process or take a resolution to change the process to the membership.
As the rhetoric within the reserve escalated this spring, the band council issued a community notice on May 23 that stated that 50 per cent of the $20.3-million would go to debt repayment and about 40 per cent to bolster current band programs. Only $1.5-million would be available for distribution.
The response further angered those who felt their voices were not being heard. They began an "occupation" of the lobby of the band office on May 29, saying they intended to stay until they were given a say in the decision-making process for distribution of the funds.
As tempers flared, the group alleged corruption, a lack of accountability and nepotism they said rewarded family and friends of those who controlled the purse strings. Members of the group, who call themselves the Musqueam Membership Movement, allege that some band members receive preferential treatment in housing and work opportunities.
"M.M.M. recognize that our community is land and assets rich but seek understanding why we are still living under poverty level and in oppression," they stated in a June 9 letter to council.
Mr. Point denied the allegations, and Musqueam Chief Ernie Campbell demanded a public apology from the protesters.
The occupation escalated on Wednesday evening. The band council locked the protesters out of the building when they went outside for a smoke. The protesters in response padlocked the doors, effectively closing down the band administration office. Yesterday, some dissidents were talking of opening the doors on condition that the band council involves all band members in decisions about the money.

The land the band owns
1 Fraser Arms hotel, pub and beer store
The Musqueam bought the property in 1993 and contracted out management until the operator defaulted on lease payments. The band took it over in 2004, closing the hotel and pub. The beer store, however, remains open. Estimated value: $5-million.
2 Celtic Shipyards
The Musqueam bought the 3.5-hectare site in 1988 to provide jobs for band members. The shipyard employed 40 people in the 1990s, about half of them native, and made about $5-million in sales. The industry shrank and the Musqueam partnered with Progressive Construction to sell off the riverfront land in lots for equestrian estate homes. The band is expected to receive $8-million from the sales.
3 Shaughnessy Golf Course
There are 35 years left in the lease for the 64.8-hectare course, but the Musqueam may try to buy it out. The waterfront land would be worth "a fortune" if redeveloped for housing, a realtor said, but it's impossible to estimate at current values.
4 Salish Park subdivision
The 120 homes on the 20-hectare area have 70 years left in their 99-year lease. Estimated value: $15-million.
5 Musqueam Park subdivision
The 15.2-hectare site includes Shalimar Estates, which has 75 townhouses, and 60 homes with 70 years remaining in their leases. Estimated value: $65-million.
6 Musqueam Golf and Learning Academy
The Musqueam leased the 22.8-hectare property, then Eaglequest Golf Course, to Propriety Industries but bought out the lease for $5-million in 2004. They now run the golf course in partnership with former Canucks player Gino Odjick.
7 University Golf Course
The B.C. government bought the course from the University of British Columbia for $30-million and gave the 59-hectare property to the band as part of a multimillion-dollar land-claim settlement this year. The Musqueam are obligated to keep it as a golf course until 2083. Estimated value: $200-million if developed.
8 Bridgepoint Lands and River Rock Casino
The seven-hectare property is on a historic midden used by the band and part of the Musqueam's 2008 provincial settlement. Estimated value: $40-million to $50-million.
9 Pacific Spirit Regional Park
One of two parcels of parkland in the Musqueam's 2008 provincial settlement. It's 13.8 hectares, at the northwest point of the reserve. Estimated value: $220-million if developed.
10 Pacific Spirit Regional Park "Block F"
One of two parcels of parkland in the 2008 provincial settlement. The Musqueam must keep 1.2 hectares of the block's 8.5 hectares as a public park. Estimated value: $90-million to $100-million.
11 Garden City Lands
If an application to remove the 55-hectare property from the Agriculture Land Reserve is successful, Canada Lands will sell roughly half to Richmond and will develop the other half jointly with the Musqueam. Estimated value: $50-million
Anna Mehler Paperny and Robert Matas
The Musqueam band owns or has an interest in numerous properties in and around Vancouver. The most valuable property, Pacific Spirit Regional Park, won by the band in a 2008 provincial settlement, is reckoned by real-estate experts to be worth $220-million if properly developed.

Full text: In the bohemian neighbourhoods of Vesterbro and Norrebro, restaurants and shops thrive on the local vibe, Janet Forman writes
There's a golden moment in gentrifying city districts - the period just before the local bohemian communities, with their eccentric shops and cheap coffee, are pushed out by their fellow travellers, real-estate developers. Such is certainly the case now in the Copenhagen neighbourhoods of Vesterbro, once a mustering point for prostitutes, and Norrebro, formerly the destination of choice for protest-hungry students.
"A few years ago, Vesterbro was one of the worst areas in Denmark," says 29-year-old Rune Jochumsen, one of the chefs/co-owners of area restaurant formel B. "People would have to take a 50-krone cab to get here."
The angriest screeds in Norrebro these days are on the walls of an espresso bar, and in most parts of Vesterbro you can shop for a lovely pair of pumps without being aggressively propositioned.
"It's cleaner now, but a little more boring," says Jonas, looking up from his book on the steps of Bang and Jensen, an old Vesterbro pharmacy that has been transformed into a trendsetters' gathering place. It's the middle of the afternoon and already the moth-eaten couches and rows of old cinema seats are filled with locals sipping craft beers and devouring muesli-based cuisine.
For a little excitement, perhaps Jonas could put down his book and head to the neighbourhood rock palace, Vega, whose mahogany floors and flamboyant friezes were a beehive of union offices a generation ago. Now, the building houses the soignee Ideal Bar, Vega Lounge and two concert halls that host headliners such as David Bowie, the Foo Fighters and Canadian star Feist, progressive groups like the Danish metal band Volbeat and ripping DJs like Fatboy Slim.
A few blocks away near the suburb of Frederiksberg is Meyers Deli, a café and artisanal grocery store at the centre of a culinary revolution known as the New Nordic cuisine. At square communal tables, fashionistas and toddler-toting parents sample the region's unique style of gastronomy in the form of brown ale ice cream, the oddly tropical sea buckthorn juice and a jam made of rare Arctic brambles. Some drop strawberries into a glass of birch juice, a barely sweet liquid that makes the fruit explode with flavour.
At formel B, meanwhile, Jochumsen and his 28-year-old partner, Kristian Moller, employ a shadowy local icon known as the Master Forager, a bike-riding countercultural elder statesman in his 70s who sometimes pulls lamb's lettuce and wild mushrooms straight from the ground of Vesterbro.
Danish style
Denmark's designers are attracting as much attention as its chefs these days, and design devotees should set their sights on Norrebro, where some of the country's most unconventional craftspeople are alighting on the quarter's pinwheel lanes.
On Elmegade, spirited clothing designers light up the racks at Funf, the lingerie at Missekat is dangerously flirty, and the neon-hued bicycles at Cykelmageren look like pop sculpture.
On adjacent Faelledvej, LLLP carries gem-coloured scarves and a respectable catalogue of cutting-edge Scandinavian jeans, from high-end Acne to Cheap Monday for the frugal.
The shop's fanciful lampshades, which pack flat for travel, illuminate one of Norrebro's liveliest - and cleanest - gathering spots, the Laundromat Café. Nirvana for the traveller who wants a good spin cycle with his cappuccino, the bistro is equipped with washers and dryers, as well as 4,000 used books, chess and backgammon sets, wireless Internet service and clued-in English-speaking locals.
"We opened here because Norrebro is a neighbourhood of designers," says Icelandic born owner Fridrik Weisshappel Jonsson, "the kind of people open to new things" - not because he felt the area needed a cleanup.
Maria Peterson agrees. The owner of Tea Time, a velvet-draped parlour offering delicate pink and yellow cupcakes, maintains that there would be no "princess" pastries here without the gritty streets. "In a nice neighbourhood, there would be no tension," she says. "My other shop is in Vesterbro."
Of course, compared with its firebrand era, Norrebro is counterculture lite these days. A political café has been transformed into one of Copenhagen's hottest music spots, Rust; a gathering place called Gefährlich, German for "dangerous," delivers underground trends via vinyl records and T-shirts; and a bit of raunch remains at concert venue Stengade 30, where the Rub a Dub Sundays promise to "waste" your Mondays.
But even now that the agent provocateurs have decamped for more affordable locales, parts of the neighbourhood remain untouched by sushi bars and shoe shops. A few metres from the chaotic second-hand stores on Ravnsborggade, the pierced and tattooed brush shoulders with hijab -clad women, Muslim kids lift their robes to kick a soccer ball and shawarma stands outnumber smoked-fish shops.
Gentrification still seems a long way off.

Full text: Kingston seems to have something for nature lovers, history buffs and theatre aficionados.
The city, which according to its official website has a population of about 113,000, also boasts two universities and a college.
"We're not a significantly large population, so the atmosphere is very friendly and very open," says Larry McDowall, president of the Kingston and Area Real Estate Association.
Besides being a major port from which to cruise the 1000 Islands, the city offers Fort Henry, built in the 1830s, and the Rideau Canal, both designated world heritage sites, Mr. McDowall notes.
In addition, there are plenty of theatres, galleries and museums.
According to Mr. McDowall, the average resale price of a house in the Kingston area is $231,992 as of April.

'Feel-good' towers not wanted, form-fit is

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/feel-good-towers-not-wanted-form-fit-is/docview/382719937/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Local pundits have lavished praise on the project, hailing it as a "landmark" akin to the Eiffel Tower, a "magnificent structure," and so on. Mr. [Daniel Libeskind] himself says of it: "The Ascent at Roebling's bridge is a living, breathing work that stirs the soul and lifts the spirit."

Full text: Libeskind's Ascent is out of place, but van Berkel's Five Franklin borrows from its neighbours and hits the right note
Browsing the international architectural press recently, I came across a couple of American tall buildings from which local designers and we skyscraper fans can learn a thing or two. I thought you might be interested, so here they are.
One is Daniel Libeskind's typically (for him) eccentric Ascent in the Cincinnati suburb of Covington, Ky., near the Roebling Suspension Bridge over the Ohio River. It is the architect's first tall residential structure in the United States.
Rising and flaring from 14 to 22 storeys in a broad curve, this condominium tower is the kind of thing Toronto needs in very sparse amounts, if at all.
A note about the aesthetics. The building is clad, on two elevations, with large plank-like slabs of precast concrete interrupted by blue glass. The upthrust prow of this theologically named building has balconies, which, according to one report, are intended to open to views of downtown Cincinnati.
Local pundits have lavished praise on the project, hailing it as a "landmark" akin to the Eiffel Tower, a "magnificent structure," and so on. Mr. Libeskind himself says of it: "The Ascent at Roebling's bridge is a living, breathing work that stirs the soul and lifts the spirit." It's a tall building designed quite obviously to knock the socks off Cincinnati and Covington residents.
I have argued elsewhere that look-at-me towers occasionally have a place in the urban fabric and in architectural thinking. The Toronto-area city of Mississauga, for example, could probably use a few marquee condo buildings to lend aesthetic spark to its humdrum expanse of rootless suburban sprawl. Beijing architect Yansong Ma's much-touted, curvaceous "Marilyn" towers, now under construction, may just do the trick.
While I won't presume to tell Cincinnati or Covington what they need, I wonder whether Ascent is it.
Most old, well-rooted American communities, especially in the vast heartland of the country, could stand much vigorous repair and restoration. Crowd-pleasing "icons" in such places can distract public attention from the difficult, serious work of city-building, or rebuilding. Flashy eye-poppers like Ascent are usually all about tourism, and contribute little or nothing to the mending of the frayed urban tapestry. As I suggested, they may have a small part to play in lending identity to a quick-built suburb like Mississauga. I don't see what good Ascent can do for elderly, self-possessed Cincinnati, other than make the city briefly feel better about its "progress" than perhaps it should.
Another American high-rise that deserves attention, this one exactly because of its city-building potential, will soon go up in the heart of New York's Tribeca neighbourhood.
The 20-storey luxury condominium building is called Five Franklin Place, and is the first important American project by architect and theorist Ben van Berkel, of the Dutch firm UNStudio. The structure will be situated among older neighbours on a recently restored 19th-century laneway. If renderings are anything to go on - the ones I found seem honest enough - Mr. van Berkel's project will be an excellent instance of sound, sensitive urbanism.
Interesting new architectural schemes destined for well-established areas in every city usually take one of two forms: appropriation of the best moves in the more mature architecture round about or a delineation of vivid contrasts between the new and old. Either approach can produce a fine building.
It's all to the good, however, if the architect can figure out a way to meld the two strategies into a single instrument of design.
Which is what Mr. van Berkel has accomplished in his proposal for Five Franklin Place. With a bow to the Victorian cast-metal facades for which Tribeca is famous, the architect has wrapped his building in horizontal metal straps that vary in width, creating a handsomely sculpted, urbane and lively front elevation. The edifice fits into its place in the city, reinforcing such admirable things about lower Manhattan as the streetscapes of building fronts pressed tight against sidewalks and the business-like atmosphere that has survived from the district's former career as a zone of workshops and warehouses.
At the same time, Five Franklin Place will be entirely a building of our era. The metal bands will alternate with expanses of glass, and step-backs in the facade respond to contemporary concerns about the need for sunlight at street level.
The whole composition is unmistakably modern, in the best sense of the word: efficient, serious, open-handed.
In its freshness and serene grace, and in its mindfulness about its new-kid-on-the block status in an enormously complex urban environment, Mr. van Berkel's design provides a model of architectural citizenship that architects in Toronto, Cincinnati and every other North American city would do well to adopt in their own work.

Full text: The recent trend of sales declines coupled with modest price gains in the resale housing market continued into the first half of June, the Toronto Real Estate Board said this week.
The average price for a home in the Greater Toronto Area rose to $398,542 in the first two weeks of June, up 4 per cent from the $384,576 average for the same period a year ago, and an increase of 11 per cent from the $358,648 recorded at mid-June, 2006.
In the city of Toronto, the current average price is $439,469, up 3 per cent over the $424,888 a year ago, and 14 per cent higher than the $386,960 average in the first half of June, 2006.
In the 905 region, the average price is $371,686, up 4 per cent from the $357,359 average a year ago and an increase of 10 per cent from the $338,578 recorded at mid-June 2006.
A total of 4,374 homes were sold in the first half of June, a 14-per-cent decline from a year ago.
However, in a press release, TREB president Maureen O'Neill pointed out that 2007 was "a particularly strong year" in the local real estate market and that, when compared with the first half of June, 2006, this month's sales are up 7 per cent.
In the city of Toronto, 1,733 sales were recorded in the period, representing a 15-per-cent decrease, compared with the 2,045 properties sold a year ago, but a 2-per-cent increase over the 1,690 transactions in the first half of June, 2006.
In the 905 region, 2,641 properties changed hands, a 13-per-cent decline, compared with the 3,029 homes sold in the first half of June last year, but an 11-per-cent increase over the 2,384 properties sold at mid-June, 2006.
The neighbourhoods of Riverdale, West Agincourt, Caledon and Richmond Hill South all experienced particularly strong activity in the first half of this month.
In Riverdale, sales increased 28 per cent from the first half of June, 2007, driven by strong condo resales. Condos also pushed up sales in West Agincourt by 24 per cent from the same period a year ago.
In Caledon, strong detached home sales led to a 9-per-cent increase over the same period a year ago. In Richmond Hill, similar strength in sales of detached homes resulted in a 5-per-cent increase from mid-June, 2007.

Full text: With interest in horse-related activities on the rise, builders are planning projects with stables and indoor riding facilities
There was a time when the horsy set brought to mind pampered gentry who wore jodhpurs and attended things like coming out balls. Tracy Lord in The Philadelphia Story , for example - she would have been a horse rider. English style, of course.
Considering that practically every girl around the age of eight years old falls hard for the idea of owning a horse, it was just a matter of time until the horsy set adjusted itself to middle-class demands. As well, the horsy lifestyle occupies a natural spot within the green movement, where a ride through the wilderness on a non-gas-guzzling beast is the epitome of back-to-basics leisure.
Developers have taken notice, responding with equestrian communities, with shared stables and horse care that means savings for horse owners. It also means a pastoral setting for those who might just want to live among the horsy set, without ever having to mount a horse.
The horse, says developer Michael Goodman, is the "new golf." Statistics do show growth. Horse-related businesses have steadily grown 7 per cent in the past 15 years, according to the Horse Council of B.C. In Langley, the High Point Equestrian Estate is luxury living for the horsy set.
Mr. Goodman, owner of Richmond's Tri City Group, is in the process of delivering a green, affordable equestrian community to the outdoorsy city of Squamish. Squamish, as British Columbians know, is the playground for outdoor enthusiasts, connected to Whistler by the Sea-to-Sky Highway. If Mr. Goodman has his way, the locals will soon count horseback riding among their leisure activities.
"There is a ton of people interested in just buying around a horse community - they don't necessarily ride horses themselves," says Mr. Goodman.
Mr. Goodman purchased 140 acres of undeveloped property that runs alongside the Cheakamus River and is criss-crossed with old logging trails. His Paradise Trails proposal calls for the low-density development of 82 lots, including a smaller adjacent site that's currently crown land. If his purchase of the crown land goes through, the project would total 167 acres. Each lot will average two acres and have access to stables and an indoor riding facility with "world-class teachers" to give lessons. As well, the community would have access to stable hands, a vet, a tack shop, coffee bar and banquet facility. Of the horse stalls, 25 per cent would be reserved for Squamish residents to use.
The sustainable community would include buildings with LEED certification, on-site composting and a self-contained tertiary water treatment system.
With the greater Squamish community in mind, Mr. Goodman proposes a development that would dedicate 15 kilometres of trails to the public. He proposes reforestation of the previously logged site, with a public pathway along the river.
The lots would be priced at around the $400,000 range, which, says Mr. Goodman, is fairly typical for Squamish.
"The lots will be the upper middle class kind of price range," he says. "And people will decide what types of houses they want to build themselves. We will have a quality standard, and a restricted size. But we're going to leave it up to people to use their own creativity."
Susan Balcom saw the market for the new horsy set when she quit her day job to open a tack store in Langley. Business has been so steady that she's opened a second tack shop, in Vancouver's Southlands flats. Ms. Balcom says the majority of her customers are women with extra cash flow.
"I think that while a lot of their husbands are out playing golf, today's professional woman would like to go out and ride," she says. "A lot of these women are independently successful, so they are choosing to spend a lot of money on an activity they truly enjoy."
She estimates that it costs about $1,000 a month to own a horse and ride it, including about $700 a month for boarding and maintenance costs such as shoeing and lessons.
"I think that's why these equestrian communities are going to be successful," says Ms. Balcom. "One of the big draws is that between neighbours, you could share some of the workload and the cost."
Before Mr. Goodman embarked on the equestrian idea, he consulted Carolyn Lair, a community development specialist with whom he'd worked on marina projects.
"He said, 'I bought this piece of property and I don't know what to do with it," recalls Ms. Lair. "I fell in love with it."
Ms. Lair did extensive conservation research before deciding the land was compatible with horses. Ms. Lair, who moved to B.C. from California, comes from a family hard-bitten by the horse life. She has two sisters who train horses, a niece who makes a living as a horse braider and a brother who's a farrier.
"The lands traditionally used for equestrian activity are all being developed," she says. "We felt that it would be a good match and a way to keep the trails on our land public and a link to municipal trails.
"I think it's very unusual," she adds. "As far as I know, we're the only ones pulling together the notion of the equestrian club with sustainability practices."

A graceful glazier gives a touch of glass to Toronto homes

Full text: John F. Wilcox has travelled the world to stoke his passion
You'd almost be inclined to call him a bull in a china shop the way he's bouncing around the 1,500-square-foot studio.
Almost. But don't confuse enthusiasm for a lack of grace: John F. Wilcox, the award-winning owner of Vitreous Glassworks, has gobs of grace and the delicate touch needed to be around all of this beautiful glass. It's just that he's got a lot of things he wants to show off - "Oh, you're a fan of Vitrolite? Follow me!" or "Oh, sure, we did the windows at the Sharon Temple; here's a picture!" - and not a lot of time.
And then there's that booming laugh that waggles his bushy beard. It's a laugh born out of confidence, not braggadocio, and it punctuates a fascinating conversation ranging from glassy things local to far-flung, modern to historic.
"We may have the largest collection of Victorian bird windows in the world!" he says, his chuckle ricocheting off the cinderblock walls. "It's something that we can always say because it's up to another city to try and say otherwise."
He's holding up an example from Parkdale right now, which he's going to restore along with a bunch of others in the room.
He's such an expert craftsman, even if half of that gorgeous stained glass was missing - including the part with the little painted bird - he could recreate it.
Before I can get him talking about his own history, he's bouncing again - to the invention of glass as told by Pliny the Elder, to Britain's "window tax" of the 1700s and 1800s, to modernist architect I.M. Pei's urgent call for glass that was less green (the colour, not the movement) for his pyramid at the Louvre, and, finally, to where Toronto's glass factories once stood.
"It's a fascinating history, the history of glass," says the 43-year-old, sweating a little after all that running around.
But no less fascinating than the story of how he became one of Toronto's top glaziers. An early love of stained glass led him to a leading Toronto ecclesiastical studio for an apprenticeship in the 1980s. It was the perfect time to learn, he says, because many of the masters that had been working since the Second World War were basking in the glow of impending retirement ... and feeling charitable as a result.
"They weren't threatened by me," he begins. "I heard years later that they were all very secretive with their techniques before and there were rivalries and stuff like that."
Next, he started to "augment" that knowledge with his own study, first with a course in glass-forming at the Ontario College of Art, glass-blowing at Sheridan College and, finally, the architectural technology program at Ryerson, which "gave me the language," he says simply.
He also bought a "one way ticket to Paris" to ogle medieval churches, then ended up in Egypt studying ancient Islamic stained-glass windows, in which plaster rather than lead is used because "they don't have the rains that would ruin them." Along the way, he visited as many glass-restoration studios as possible to observe local technique.
In 1992, he founded Vitreous Glassworks and, after working mostly as a subcontractor for larger companies, began to get big commissions of his own. He did restoration work on windows at Massey Hall; the Massey mausoleum at Mount Pleasant Cemetery; the Ontario government's Whitney Block; the ultra-hip West Queen West bookends, the Gladstone and Drake hotels; and, perhaps most impressive, the three long windows over the former main entrance to the Royal Ontario Museum, for which he won an award.
He also cast small glass blocks mimicking the old aluminum grills that once graced the ROM's original wooden doors before they were reinstalled: "I did this basically for free because it's such an honour," he says.
But that's not to say he's gotten too big to do little residential projects, whether it's restoration of some stained glass for a grand Annex lady or the creation of something brand new and minimalist for a modern abode or business. (If you're ever in the neighbourhood, check out the amazing non-denominational birch tree window he created for the chapel at the Wexford senior's residence.)
Although he understands that "glass is very alluring" to the general public, it's also incredibly fickle and delicate. The average homeowner, he cautions, should leave removal and restoration to the professionals: One wrong move and what may have been a quick cleaning and reputtying for a few hundred dollars will become a few thousand.
"Somehow the glass knows," he says with a hint of mystery. "If you're afraid of it, you transfer that emotion to the glass somehow and you can break it."
Those with questions about how to keep their heritage windows healthy would be wise to visit the Lillian Smith Library at College and Huron streets tomorrow at 2 p.m. The Toronto branch of the Architectural Conservancy of Ontario has invited the excitable Mr. Wilcox to leave his pen to give an illustrated talk, "Glass in Architecture," on the history of glass and his own work around town. Admission is free, and I guarantee you'll leave with a newfound or rekindled love for glass.
And that's no bull.

Full text: Is Toronto recession-proof? Judging by the well-publicized agonies Central Canada is now going through - the so-called Dutch disease made feverish by $140-a-barrel oil, compounded by endless global financial crises - it might seem rash even to suggest such a thing. But so far, it's true.
Every developer fears the worst. In the meantime, they are all scrambling to meet insistent demand for new places to work and live.
The vacancy rate for top-quality downtown office space "went into freefall" in the first quarter of 2008, according to Cushman & Wakefield Lepage, dragging down vacancy rates for all kinds of commercial space in central Toronto.
Rental rates rose correspondingly: Companies scrambling to find a good address in the financial core drove up rents by the annual equivalent of 14 per cent in the first three months of this year, according to Cushman, leasing almost one million square feet of space over the same time.
That's why so many new office buildings are going up downtown, with 3.4 million square feet - the equivalent of the entire Toronto-Dominion Centre - coming to market next year. If the captains of Canadian commerce are concerned about the disappearance of Canadian manufacturing, they're doing their best to hide it. Locally, it appears to be a non-issue.
One reason is that manufacturing already left the city, with a giant sucking sound, after the advent of free trade in the 1990s. A recession that the rest of the country barely noticed brought Toronto to its knees, wiping out an incredible 200,000 jobs. Local employment has still not reached the level it attained in 1989, but the theory is that the newer jobs that have appeared since then are better adapted to the global economy.
Any manufacturing jobs that haven't left Toronto already, must have a good reason to stay. In the meantime, high-value service industries are all but booming.
It's safe to say that few if any experts expect that to continue as global financial losses mount. But there is some hope that the consequences will be much less severe locally than elsewhere in the so-called heartland. Although no city is an island, some are more securely connected than others.
Ontarians may wail about being victimized by an overvalued "petro-dollar," but Bay Street doesn't mind. The Toronto Stock Exchange is heavily weighted in favour of resource stocks, boasting that it and its junior affiliate list more oil and gas companies than any other exchange in the world. Mining finance is another Toronto specialty that is thriving in the era of high commodity prices. What's bad for General Motors continues to be a source of considerable wealth for local Porsche dealers.
In that context, Toronto is closer to Alberta than Oshawa. As for a Florida-style housing crash, that's further away than either. The border might as well be an iron curtain when it comes to real-estate value. Although the local market is softening, rampant new construction shows little sign of abating.
You could have said the same thing in 1990 as the city economy soared over an unforeseen cliff. People forget that the Bob Rae government inherited a balanced budget. Things change fast. For the time being, however, rose-coloured glasses are indicated.

Full text: Vancouver's film industry is enjoying a sequel: Big investors are keen to sink money into studios
The high-flying loonie and the lingering effects of the Hollywood writers' strike have broadsided the Vancouver film sector in recent months, despite the city's reputation as a hangout for film stars in town working on the next blockbuster.
But the city has also become a hangout for investors, whose interest in local film studios is spotlighting a sector that's proving action-packed in an otherwise lacklustre British Columbia commercial real estate market.
The past two years have seen Lions Gate Entertainment Corp.'s North Vancouver studios sold to Bosa Development Corp. of Burnaby and the province's sale of its Bridge Studios facility in Burnaby to Larco Investments Ltd. of Vancouver.
More recently, General Electric Co.'s GE Real Estate has stepped in with the biggest investment yet - a $50-million financing of McLean Group's Vancouver Film Studios complex in East Vancouver.
The financing consolidates various loans McLean obtained in the late 1990s to support the development of 11 buildings on a 15-acre site as Vancouver rose to prominence among U.S. film companies.
Over all, the industry spends about $1-billion on production annually in the province, according to the B.C. Film Commission. Hollywood features and television shows dominate the spending, with the typical production worth in excess of $20-million. That's better than in Ontario, which logged nearly $800-million in projects last year, but a greater volume of domestic projects - 164 versus 138 for B.C.
The investment by Connecticut-based GE reduces borrowing costs and positions Vancouver Film Studios for future growth, says Jason McLean, McLean Group's president, adding that a 30,000-square-foot soundstage is among the projects under consideration at its 15-acre campus in East Vancouver.
"The data, historically, is that people still want to watch films, and they want to go to movies and they want to watch TV as much as they do in a buoyant economy as in a challenged economy," Mr. McLean says. "It's an industry where we want to be if the real estate market slows down."
A tight market for industrial space in Metro Vancouver has created favourable conditions for McLean and other studio operators, including Bosa, Larco and Canada Motion Picture Park, industry observers say.
When McLean became involved in the studio business in the 1980s, many stages were set up in warehouses and other industrial properties where production companies made use of excess space.
"We started renting warehouses to film productions that would come in and pay us way more than we were getting from long-term commercial tenants," Mr. McLean says. "We thought to ourselves: 'If we could figure out a way to reduce our vacancy numbers, we're making far more off these short-term users than our long-term commercial tenants.' "
Today, demand for industrial space has pushed vacancies to historic lows - about 2 per cent region-wide and 1 per cent in Vancouver, according to Colliers International.
At the same time, a technological shift has boosted the space demands of production companies. A high-profile program, such as The X-Files , for example, required just three stages for filming; today, a more modest cable offering such as Eureka requires four.
The result has been a boom in demand for space at purpose-built studios, which Colliers vice-president John Boer likens to hotels or mini-storage facilities rather than traditional industrial real estate. "When you've got three- or four-month requirements competing with five-year leases in the industrial sector, the five-year guys are always going to win. So you need the specialty product just to respond."
Mr. Boer, who with colleague James Glen brokered the province's sale of Bridge Studios to Larco in a heated bidding process last year, said demand for film studios remains strong, despite the high Canadian dollar reducing a competitive advantage for productions north of the border.
"I think it's a huge endorsement to the industry that it remains as strong as it does given that it [the dollar] remains at par. And if I were GE, I would get a lot of confidence out of that," he said. "There's still great demand for the product here. The studios are staying pretty full, so, from an investment standpoint, I think it's still a pretty good product."
A number of potential lenders expressed interest in the McLean Group financing; GE was chosen in part because of its interest in the long-term direction of Vancouver Film Studios, observers say.
Indeed, GE's financing of the development of Toronto's Filmport, a $50-million facility boasting 260,000 square feet of production space, is making it a major player in Canada's film business.
Alexandre Sieber, GE's Montreal-based vice-president and general manager of business property, says it's not so much the glamour of the film industry that attracts GE but the opportunities that will add value to its portfolio. GE booked about $7.5-billion in new business in Canada last year primarily in the office, industrial and multifamily sectors.
"The industry is attractive, particularly in provinces like B.C., Quebec and Ontario. We have to realize that the film industry has an impact of about $1-billion on the economy of B.C.," Mr. Sieber said. "Vancouver is strategically placed to attract a lot of attention from California, for many reasons."
Those include being in the same time zone as Hollywood, and being close enough to Los Angeles that crews can go home on weekends. The proximity of the studios to the airport and a vibrant downtown are also part of Vancouver's appeal.
"They can't be out in the sticks, they have to be within 20 minutes of downtown Vancouver," Mr. McLean says, emphasizing the importance of convenience to tenants. "You've got certain above-the-line talent that aren't going to stay in a Motel 6, they're going to be in a downtown hotel."
Mr. Sieber added that the relative youth of Vancouver Film Studios' assets also made it attractive, mirroring the overall growth that has taken place in Western Canada over the past decade - both in its own right and on the balance sheets of investors such as GE. Western Canada accounted for a quarter of the $5-billion of new investment GE made in Canada last year.
"We follow opportunities," Mr. Sieber said. "We go where there's great investments to be done on the GE balance sheets. So the Western Canada part has increased faster than Central and Eastern Canada."

Full text: It's been named one of the world's most livable cities by Monocle magazine, but all things popular end up being punished
Some of you may have stifled a yawn the other day, reading that Tyler Brûlé's magazine Monocle published a "most livable cities" list in their most recent issue. Once again, Vancouver has been included in the glittering firmament of the world's most desirable urban places.
We are praised this time in particular for green eco-density initiatives, tolerance and cultural diversity. Our role as a Cantopop and Bollywood feeder system is also noted.
It's getting almost predictable though, isn't it? I worry we'll soon be spoiled. But the ranking also makes me wonder if Vancouver won't ultimately be punished for all this attention, just as all things fashionable are ultimately punished for their popularity. (Mustaches, for example, which I'm confident are going to get punished again if this most recent comeback continues even a single season longer.)
No doubt the compilers of these lists would dispute that fashion has anything to do with it. Monocle actually takes pains to point out their list "has not been developed as a guide for ex-pats looking for their next plummy posting." Instead, the magazine assures us that scientific and subjective data have been gathered allowing editors to identify cities that prioritize the "happiness and well-being" of their residents.
That certainly sounds well-intentioned. And in fairness, diversity and tolerance are precisely the qualities that urban studies guru Richard Florida has told us are sought out by those coveted, mobile "creative classes" that all the world's most successful cities are able to attract and hold.
Still, I can't shake the sense of Vancouver just recently having vaulted up the high-school pecking order, now hanging at the front table in the cafeteria with the popular kids (Kyoto, Barcelona, Paris), and choosing to forget about all that time spent in the east stairwell with the fringe players, the nerds and wonks and industry towns (Calgary, Regina, Cincinnati).
Certainly some of this impression derives from Mr. Brûlé himself. The Winnipeg-born founder of the hugely successful 1990s fashion-and-design magazine Wallpaper*, Mr. Brûlé has made a career out of identifying what's in and out for readers. Monocle may not concern itself explicitly with fashion, but it responds to a similar impulse. A magazine about monied cosmopolitanism for monied cosmopolitans, Monocle is a globalist stylebook.
I was actually in Las Vegas on a food-related assignment when the Monocle rankings were published, which may have sharpened my response to the whole issue. I had something like an out-of-body experience reading about Vancouver while sitting in Mario Batali's B & B Ristorante at The Venetian, accordion music wheezing in from the "Grand Canal," and tucking into my lamb's brain francobolli . Notions of greenness and cultural diversity, not to mention authenticity, are pretty much scrambled to incoherence in such environments.
Of course, Las Vegas never ranks on any of these lists. Its 40 million visitors a year beat Venice (or Vancouver for that matter, by about 34 million), but that's just it. People visit. I'll bet even Richard Florida's "creative classes" visit. Or they do if they like to gamble, or eat, or maybe just like being reassured by street vendors that a prostitute can be delivered to their room in no more than 20 minutes. But they don't stay. And that leaves Las Vegas virtually off the grid of urban spaces on which monied cosmopolitans might choose to even semi-permanently invest their lifestyles.
Understanding a city's current place in such a contiguous and competitive grid is central to Richard Florida's writing. In his new book Who's Your City? , he speaks of a "spiky world" in which two distinct tiers of places may be found. The spikes are "globally oriented" cities in which the creative classes will choose to live (and which, presumably, would warrant coverage by Monocle). The rest are "local," anonymous urban and semi-urban regions where, among other things, real estate values will always underperform.
I find the two-tier model persuasive, since there's no arguing with the reality of a newly mobile class of people out there. I have numerous university friends who have never been back to the cities of their youth. But I wonder about this repudiation of the local, right at the same moment in history when other fashion cycles (in food, notably) have swung hard in the other direction.
Maybe jet-setting will never truly go out of style, and will even enjoy a surge in prestige as the cost rises with soaring fuel prices. But perhaps cities would fare better in the end, contributing more to the "happiness and well-being" of their residents, by completely ignoring these lists.
In the meantime, it seems relevant to Vancouver what other cities joined us near the top of Mr. Brûlé's listing, cities such as Copenhagen and Helsinki, Stockholm and Munich. Each may have its scientific and subjective reasons for being selected (even if those don't include cultural diversity and tolerance). But each, like Vancouver, also has a sense of freshness about it. Each is a city as yet unpolluted by the sort of mega-popularity that immediately puts the visitor in the midst of an uncool throng of 40 million. Each is a city ready to be fashionable: for Monocle readers, for the creative classes, for however long it lasts.

A contrarian yuppie snob - moi - returns to her roots

Abstract: So I guess you've heard the news: McDonald's, that glorious bastion of all things disgusting and bad for you, has come out with an Angus burger. This is not to be confused with a burger named after a Scotsman, but one made from "one-third pound of juicy 100 per cent Angus beef," according to the sandwich's official website.

Full text: So I guess you've heard the news: McDonald's, that glorious bastion of all things disgusting and bad for you, has come out with an Angus burger. This is not to be confused with a burger named after a Scotsman, but one made from "one-third pound of juicy 100 per cent Angus beef," according to the sandwich's official website.
My beef-inhaling sources tell me that the sandwich is "actually pretty good," which is, in my view, a great disappointment.
While the commercial for the Angus burger features two hungry male thirtysomething roomies, news of the launch put me in mind of the cranky old lady from the famed Burger King ad. In my mind's eye, I lifted the bun, scrunched up my nose and hollered, "Where's the crap?!"
I miss the days when bad things could just simply be bad. Why is it these days we must dress everything up as new, improved, upgraded or purified? I'm all for fresh white asparagus and imported Italian bathroom faucets, but sometimes you just want a crappy burger from a low-end burger joint. What ever happened to shameless crummy convenience?
When I was a kid growing up in small-town Ontario, everything was crap. It was the eighties, decade of designer shoulder pads, Gucci loafers and home espresso makers, but the style memo never made its way to my hometown. In Cobourg, everyone I knew spent those years eating Cheez Whiz, wearing jelly shoes, watching their parents get divorced and rocking out to Debbie Gibson and the MiniPops.
By the time I hit puberty, moved to the city with my (newly single) mother and encountered anything qualitatively good, I was accustomed to a diet - both figurative and literal - of such pure, unfiltered crap, I wouldn't have recognized a free-range organic Cornish hen if it landed on my face.
Eventually, of course, I felt the need to eradicate all traces of McCain curly fries and The Love Boat from my life. I became a snob. First a music snob. Then a book snob. Eventually a food, wine, shoe, car, garden, architecture, holiday-destination and houseware snob. I subscribed to the Utne Reader. I brought my own milk fluffer to brunch. I was insufferable! But that's what your 20s are for. How was I to know my own taste revelation would coincide with the turn of the century and the decrappification of the English-speaking world? First came Starbucks, then came H & M and the next thing I knew real-estate agents in Ajax, Ont., were sipping green-tea lattes in Stella McCartney frocks.
I did the only thing any self-respecting born-again contrarian aesthetic yuppie snob would do: I returned to my roots and learned to love crap all over again.
I went to Wal-Mart and bought plastic patio furniture. I served KD and frozen peas to dinner guests. I filled my iPod with Kylie, Britney and late Elton John.
All of these choices are hard to defend, especially if you happen to move in fashionable circles - and I'd like to make it extremely clear: I DO.
Just last week, for instance, I was at a cocktail party when I happened to find myself caught in the verbal crossfire in an exchange between a well-heeled vegetarian and an even weller-heeled omnivore.
After being gently chided for chowing down on bite-sized beef carpaccio, the omnivore declared that she was not so much a meat eater as a "goodetarian," meaning, in her words, "I only eat things that are good quality, good-tasting and good for me."
I felt a stabbing pang of envy, for I immediately wanted to become a goodetarian too. And no wonder. We live in an era where, more than ever before, our consumer choices are not just a reflection of, but actually seem to determine, who and what we are. Good stuff equals good character. Hence the Angus burger: Even the meat-eating masses long to be goodetarians.
But I will not be swayed by such consumer temptations. Thank god we are entering cottage season, a.k.a. the annual festival of crap. While many people like their summer getaways right out of the pages of Dwell, I prefer a distinctly more down-market approach to Canadian holiday-making. Give me a wagon-wheel coffee table, a can of Wild Cat and a radio tuned to the local headbanger station and my inner small-town hick kicks up her jelly shoes with joy.
Because here's the thing: Without the bad, there is no good. Cast the KD out of your life and pretty soon the beef carpaccio tastes about as special as Happy Meal. McDonald's might be trying to sell me an Angus burger, but that doesn't mean I have to buy one.
Let other people have their fancy white slipcovers and $50 chardonnays this summer. I'm quite happy as a born-again crap-lover.

Abstract: The 2,000-acre property was part of a much larger cotton plantation owned in the mid-19th century by Robert McAlpin, whom local legend calls the inspiration for the novel's chief villain, Simon Legree. The property was renamed Little Eva Plantation after the novel's main character, and the cabin of fictional slave Uncle Tom was said to have been on the site.

Full text: William Armsted Robinson, a founder of DHL Worldwide Express delivery, is asking for $17-million (U.S.) for his horse ranch and $15-million for a fishing property, both in Idaho.
The reclusive businessman, one of California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger's big donors, breeds the exotic Lusitano show horse. The 940-acre horse ranch includes indoor and outdoor pens and arenas, a veterinary clinic, a breeding room and stables.
There's a 10,000-square-foot main house, a roughly four-acre man-made pond and an airstrip and hangar for a small aircraft. About 180 acres can be developed; the rest are under a conservation easement. The property borders a national forest. The 70-odd Lusitanos on the property aren't included in the offer.
About 30 kilometres north, Mr. Robinson's 600-acre fishing ranch has a four-bedroom house along the Falls River, plus a separate guest house. There's a four-stall barn and several kilometres of trails, and Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks are close by.
Mr. Robinson, who sold his stake in the express-delivery company in 2003, bought the properties vacant in the 1990s and built all of the infrastructure and facilities, according to agent Roger Brink of Alta Realty.
Property may be linked
to Uncle Tom's cabin
In Louisiana, a property that's been linked to the 19th-century classic Uncle Tom's Cabin is on the market for $6-million.
The 2,000-acre property was part of a much larger cotton plantation owned in the mid-19th century by Robert McAlpin, whom local legend calls the inspiration for the novel's chief villain, Simon Legree. The property was renamed Little Eva Plantation after the novel's main character, and the cabin of fictional slave Uncle Tom was said to have been on the site.
State tourism and real estate websites both claim the connection to the book, which helped galvanize the antislavery movement leading to the American Civil War.
"The truth is much less definitive than the real estate declaration, but there may be some connection," says Joan Hedrick, a biographer of author Harriet Beecher Stowe and a history professor at Trinity College in Hartford, Conn.
There are seven ponds and three houses, including a roughly 6,000-square-foot main house. The property, in Natchitoches Parish about 450 kilometres northwest of New Orleans, includes 200 acres of pecan-tree farms, and other parts are leased to farmers. T-shirt mogul lists
Miami Beach lot
Seth Gerszberg, a founder of the Ecko fashion brand, has listed a nearly three-acre waterfront lot in Miami Beach for $13.9-million.
The unusually large, vacant parcel, on Pinetree Drive with about 300 feet on the water, is zoned for as many as three houses and has potential for deepwater dockage.
Mr. Gerszberg paid $9-million for the land in 2004. He plans to donate the net proceeds to Tikva, a home for abandoned Jewish children in Ukraine.
In 1993, Mr. Gerszberg and designer Marc Ecko helped found a hip-hop-inspired T-shirt company, Ecko Unlimited, whose expanded operations now include a full menswear line and a magazine.

Full text: Vastly improved web sites make consumer choices a lot easier
For many homeowners, spring means getting into spruce-up mode, and that often includes painting something somewhere along the way. Luckily, today's paint lines have never been greater in breadth.
Para Paints, based in Brampton, Ont., is a good example. It just launched 2,000 new colours. While a few hundred of their tried and true classics and their Heritage line are still available, it's a brand new world at Para.
The new colours are categorized under the thematic headings "Retreat and unwind," "Escape to the tropics," "Weekend in the country," "Night on the town," "Continental getaway" and "Coming home," and feature cheeky names such as "Who needs the headache" and "Spiked heels."
The company's much-improved website, www.parapaints.com, offers consumers several different ways to explore colour. The "2008 trendsetting style" feature spotlights colours that are hot this year, interpreted as those inspired by nature and exotic locals. Two additional features, "Collections" and "Inspiration," make it easy for buyers to select a colour scheme, print it, and take it to the paint store with them.
At Benjamin Moore, they've been inspired by nature as well. Its 2008 colour trends flow from "Modern tranquility" where neutrals that are "gossamer" and "hushed" reign, to "Organic comfort" where the keywords are "earthen," "sunlit," and "fresh sprig," to "Pure opulence" where you'll find rich mineral and gem-like hues that make a dramatic style statement.
In terms of environmental stewardship, Benjamin Moore goes beyond the latest organic colour trends. This spring, it introduced "Aura," which it describes as "a 100-per-cent acrylic interior super premium paint" that uses water-borne colorants resulting in extremely low emissions of VOCs (volatile organic compounds) of 50 grams a litre. "Aura" is also a one-coat formulation that really does cover in one coat.
While a gallon of it costs slightly more than most other paints, in the long run, consumers will save money on product and labour when only one coat is required.
"Eco spec" is another Benjamin Moore paint that is low in VOC emissions because it is only tinted to pastel and mid-tones. See www.benjaminmoore.ca for more information.
At ICI Paints, the company that brings us Dulux, Glidden, and Colour Your World, you'll find inspiration as well. When developing new palettes, the company's colour and design experts analyze current trends in fashion, art, architecture and media. They also select a "colour of the year," producing a book entitled "ColourFutures" that you can download from the company website, www.icipaints.ca.
ICI offers five colour themes for 2008: "Growing respect" gives a nod to the environment with key descriptors such as "sustainable," "natural" and "botanical." "Ebb and flow" is "inspired by the molecular aspects of water" and features translucent and reflective blues. "Art form" leans toward the influence of the Bauhaus with a collection of warm lemons, mustards, and dusty greys. "Hidden beauty" goes sensual with reds, corals, sand and skin tones. And "Explorer" is, as the name would suggest, exciting and youthful, with exotic hues from every section of the colour wheel.
Sico takes a rather different view of what's hot for 2008. They see a trend toward extreme contrasts from "dark" and "punchy" to very pale. It also predicts a move away from simple neutrals to "full chroma, vibrant colours." This is illustrated on their website, www.sico.ca, where one featured interior is dark and dramatic with midnight and peppercorn hues, the next energetic and vital with hot yellows, sky blues and clover greens, and a third is all pale and peaceful mushrooms and champagne mousse.
All of these major paint suppliers offer tools to make colour selection easy. Some sell small tester pots or packets of paint to try out in your home - a great idea because natural and artificial light affects how colour "reads."
Some, such as Benjamin Moore, provide large-scale paint sheets that usually cost around $5 each and are so much better to work with than tiny paint chips. (Not all Benjamin Moore retailers carry the larger paint sheets so call around to find one that does.) And several have colour previewer features on their websites that allow you to see different interiors in various colour schemes.
For homeowners who want to pull together their homes' colour palette themselves, my advice is to troll manufacturer websites. Use the tools they provide and browse the "inspiration" pages. Keep in mind that with palettes that suggest five or six colours, not all are paint colours; some come from fabrics, furnishings and accessories.
Through this process you'll start to get a feel for what colour trend is speaking to you the loudest. That usually translates to a resonance on an emotional level, an important consideration because, like it or not, colour does affect us emotionally. With thousands of colours out there to wade through, I say make use of every tool you can find to streamline the process!

Full text: HIVE2
By various artists
At the Magnetic North festival
in Vancouver
***
At Hive2 , the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Eleven theatre companies from Vancouver and Victoria have taken over a warehouse space behind the Centre for Digital Media on Vancouver's Great Northern Way Campus and turned it into a carnival of short plays and performance art.
Upon arrival, ticket holders are given a yellow tasting menu listing the various shows on offer and instructions on how to become part of their audiences. You may have to don an orange armband, win a lottery, carry a sign that reads "The End of the World is Nigh" or fill out a job application to gain access. No show is longer than 20 minutes; none plays to more than 18 people at a time. One tiny, delicate piece plays to an audience of just one.
No matter how quick you are, you're going to miss out on something. I got to a slightly above-average eight shows - nine, if you count the hot-dog man, who insisted that he was a star act himself.
The first work I stumbled into was an untitled piece by Radix Theatre. After a brief interview with Barb from Human Resources, six of us were hired on at the Xidar Corporation, which seems to be an offshoot of Amazon.com, located in purgatory. We were trained on an otherworldly assembly line to ship soup, CDs, books, fruit and flowers to the recently deceased - and think about the consumer choices that make up an individual personality.
There was less voluntary participation in Theatre Conspiracy's Rendition , which aimed to give a taste of life in Guantanamo Bay. If you are wearing an armband, an army officer may grab you from Hive2's atrium and make you put on an orange jumpsuit. Blindfolded and dressed in the jumpsuit, I was led to a series of cages and holding facilities where I heard recordings of politicians rationalizing torture. A fellow audience members was held in a different cell and watched my frightened reactions on closed-circuit television.
The Only Animal's You and the Moon in a Very Small Room was even more intimate - performed for just me. Blindfolded and fitted with headphones again, I was led to the start of the show. Following the instructions played to me after I was allowed to open my eyes, I walked upstairs and into a little, white room. There, I watched the story of my unrequited love affair with the moon through a microscope and projected onto a picture book in front of me. A lovely children's story for adults, this multimedia show was full of moments of delight and jump-out-of-your-skin surprise. It will stay with me.
While Hive2 is mostly experiential and participatory, some of the shows are more traditionally conceived. Rumble Productions The End is Here! is a spoof of such monster movies as Cloverfield . Theatre Replacement's WeeTube project audience-selected viral videos (Little Richard talking about Jimi Hendrix, a rabbit on the attack) on the wall of a couple's apartment, while two actors (Maiko Bae Yamamoto and a special guest star, Hive2 producer Camyar Chai) acted out the comments left by YouTube users as if they were having a normal conversation. A funny reuse of Internet detritus, accompanied by free popcorn. This was a highlight.
Other playlets I saw: Neworldtheatre's Open House mocked Vancouver's pre-Olympics property madness as three real-estate agents named Derek Johnston (one I recognized as playwright Marcus Youssef) tried to sell the audience a patch of concrete for the reasonable asking price of $670,000. Theatre Skam's Dollhouse 2000 mocked earnest Fringe theatre, corporate sponsorship and itself.
Two years ago, the first Hive took place at an old Downtown Eastside funeral parlour and was a great local success. This second edition takes place in a less immediately intriguing location, where sound bleeds from one mini-venue to another and often takes away from what you are watching. Only Rumble, Radix and Neworldtheatre truly took advantage of the space they were playing in. It's the matching of the location to the show that makes site-specific work exciting.
Ultimately, it's the novelty of Hive2 that makes a great night out, rather than the content, most of which was forgettable. Adopt a Fringe festival-style devil-may-care attitude and you'll have a wonderful time. You can take stock with beer or wine in the atrium between shows and there's music and dancing afterward. With so many Canadian theatre artists in town for Magnetic North, Hive's clever concept will pollinate across the country.
The final (sold-out) performances are at 7 tonight and tomorrow, magneticnorthfestival.ca.

Abstract: In the fall of 2006, Public Works Minister Michael Fortier called for tenders on the construction of a building in Quebec City to house more than 700 federal civil servants in the same location. The original plan was to build a 200,000-square-foot development project in Quebec City's lower town in the newly revitalized Saint-Roch district. Kevlar's land-development arm owned a large parcel of land in the area, worth $1.5-million.

Full text: The Quebec City real-estate deal that has focused renewed attention on Julie Couillard was a major federal government project worth an estimated $30-million. Recruiting Ms. Couillard to help turn the project in the Kevlar Group's favour appeared like a logical choice.
Ms. Couillard got her real-estate licence in Apri of 2007, and "hitched" it to Kevlar president André Bellerive's real-estate broker licence in an effort to promote the company's bid. The road would eventually lead to a relationship with Bernard Côté, a federal Public Works adviser, and then to Maxime Bernier, the federal industry minister at the time.
Kevlar president René Bellerive and co-president Philippe Morin had done business in Montreal and Quebec City for years. Since 2001, the company had invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the construction, renovation and acquisition of major properties in the two cities.
The company contributed money to the Parti Quebecois and the Quebec Liberal Party as well as the federal Liberal Party and a Conservative Party riding association in Montreal. But Kevlar was not well known in federal Conservative circles.
In the fall of 2006, Public Works Minister Michael Fortier called for tenders on the construction of a building in Quebec City to house more than 700 federal civil servants in the same location. The original plan was to build a 200,000-square-foot development project in Quebec City's lower town in the newly revitalized Saint-Roch district. Kevlar's land-development arm owned a large parcel of land in the area, worth $1.5-million. But city officials, including late mayor Andree Boucher and local business leaders, urged the federal government to consider a location outside the city centre in the Estimauville district. The city owned the land and was prepared to sell it at a cut-rate price of $5 a square foot for a total of $350,000 to whoever won the bid to build the federal project. Last winter, newly elected Mayor Regis Labeaume's chief of staff contacted Mr. Côté to ask whether there were any tenders presented for the city's preferred Estimauville site. According to the mayor's press secretary, Paul-Christian Nolin, Mr. Côté confirmed there were a few proposals, including one from Kevlar - which now had two projects on the table, one for the land it owned in the lower-town location and the other for the city's preferred site. Kevlar was taking no chances in its bid to obtain the development contract. A decision on the contract remains pending.

An arts-and-crafts odyssey

Full text: For a Victoria couple, restoring their cottage-style bungalow becomes a 26-year labour of love
When renovating their homes, most owners want things done bigger and faster. But when one Victoria couple bought their cottage-style home in 1982 they threw those ideas out the window - along with a pile of Gyproc and a chunk of their living room.
Brian and Leslie have since lived through more than 20 years of renovations, including the restoration of the original front porch, for which they sacrificed part of the living room.
The couple (who asked that their surname not be published) bought the 900-square-foot bungalow because it was the least expensive property in their chosen neighbourhood, Fairfield. Just minutes from downtown Victoria, Fairfield's tree-lined streets offer parks, schools and many heritage buildings, some of which date to the 1880s.
"We bought it because of the location," says Brian. "Our kids were little and we were just starting out ... We only had a bit of money so we took on things that didn't cost a lot," he recalls. This included mostly outdoor work, and the bathroom, which was "unlivable."
But once they began working on the house, something surprising happened: beneath the concrete siding, behind the overgrown yard, they found a 1912 arts and crafts bungalow - and a new passion.
With a little research the couple discovered that their home belonged to the movement that began as a reaction to late 19th-century industrialization and advocated hand craftsmanship and human-scale architecture.
Leslie says she and her husband "became really interested in the arts and crafts movement and the furniture and pottery that goes along with it."
They researched the movement and their home, searching the Victoria city archives and spending holidays checking out local architecture. "It was a rather obscure thing at the time because no one else was really talking about it," Leslie remembers.
Working nights and weekends, Brian began to restore the home, using the original, untouched dining room as a template. "It is what convinced us to buy the home," he says.
Now, other than some fresh paint and arts-and-crafts-style stencil work by Leslie, the dining room gleams in its original state, with a built-in buffet, window seat, wall panels and wainscoting.
Brian built two bedrooms in the unfinished basement for the children, and converted the second bedroom on the main level into a family room, which matches the mood of the dining room with custom-made wall panels and woodwork.
Their arts-and-crafts passion fully roused, the couple became determined to recreate the original dwelling to the best of their abilities. That meant reclaiming a front porch that a previous owner had walled in to create a larger living room - but with a limited budget and a growing family, that project had to wait.
"The previous owners had put in an aluminum window and we couldn't afford to replace it with an original wood window, so I put up trim and created a mantel for the fireplace," Brian recalls. "I designed the mantel shelving by taking a cue from the dining room and it looked good. But it just wasn't original without the porch."
In 1996 he set to work on the kitchen. "It took seven or eight years to finish the kitchen," Brian says.
"I went through and did one wall at a time. I created a breakfast nook that matched the dark wood panelling, took out the aluminum sliding door and put in a wood-framed substitute."
Through it all, the family lived amid the construction. "I had orange crates nailed to the walls as kitchen storage for years," says Leslie.
"I read a storybook as a child called The Boxcar Children - they make a home in an abandoned boxcar. Well, I felt like that a lot of the time," she adds.
While they struggled with the slow process of their renovations - and the mess ("I was constantly sweeping things up," says Leslie) - the couple never felt that their attention to detail and dedication to restoration was extraordinary. In fact, they found that their life amid rubble was the norm.
"All of our friends were fixing up Victorian or arts and crafts homes," Leslie recalls. "So it was totally acceptable to entertain with Gyproc dust or torn cabinets; maybe there would be no kitchen or a stove in the middle of the room."
Nor were their son and daughter upset by all the work. "We bought my son a tool kit, and while I was working he was right along beside me," says Brian.
"And he's quite handy today," adds Leslie.
Although Brian did most of the work himself, he turned to professionals when needed. "Some of the custom millwork was done by Vintage Woodworks," he says. "And we had all the lighting restored by Waterglass Studios," adds Leslie. Both Victoria companies specialize in quality heritage reproduction.
While Brian got his hands dirty, Leslie focused on the decor, filling their home with authentic period furniture and collectibles.
"It's been an adventure to decorate," she says. Her dedication to authentic finds quickly became a priority: "Half the time I was spending the grocery money, so we'd end up eating macaroni."
The children got caught up in the decorating spirit, too, she says. "I'd take the kids with me. We'd make a purchase and come home to rearrange the furniture. When Brian would get home, we'd walk him through the house until he picked out what was new."
The children caught her thrill-of-the-hunt fever, and have grown up to be collectors themselves - of "mid-century modern teak," she says.
In 2002, the couple finally got around to restoring the front porch.
"Everything was still in place, the railings and the posts, it had just been boarded in," says Brian.
"The previous owners literally just put Gyproc up and stuck on some stucco. That was it. So it wasn't too hard for us to take that away," says Leslie.
Reclaiming the generous veranda meant losing space from the living room, however. "It was a sacrifice," Leslie concedes. "We can't really entertain in that room, but it's an integral part of the home."
Her husband agrees: "It's part of the arts-and-crafts philosophy: A true bungalow had a porch. It is very neighbourly and true to this home's origins. ... We did it for the integrity of the house and the style."
Though the major restoration is complete, the couple continues to work on their home. "It's getting to the point where we have to start again," Brian explains. "We just redid the bathroom again last year." Next up: refurbishing the dining room floor.
The two say their proudest moments come when people visit the home and think everything is original. They hope their restoration will be recognized with a heritage designation from the city.
"It may not have a celebrity-filled history, and it may not be flashy, but it is an honest representation of this working-class home," says Leslie.
"After 26 years of putting our time, effort and money into the restoration and maintenance of our 96-year-old home, we want to preserve and ensure it for the future," she adds.
"Everyone has a hobby," Brian says. "Ours is our house."

With units nearly sold out in the first tower at its Heron's Hill condominium development in North York, Monarch Corp. will launch a second building on the site early next month.
The 38-storey tower, called Ultra, is one of three towers planned for what is Monarch's former headquarters site on Sheppard Avenue, just east of Highway 404. Ultimately, 1,100 suites will be built there.
"The towers are very similar, but Ultra will be the pinnacle tower," explains Mirella Sarrapochiello, manager of high-rise sales and marketing for Monarch. Construction already has begun.
The site is a short walk from Fairview Mall and the adjacent Don Mills subway station. But residents will also be able to take a shuttle bus there.
The surrounding neighbourhood contains restaurants, grocery stores, parks and golf courses.
A lot of buyers are local residents who want to stay in the area, Ms. Sarrapochiello notes, adding: "We're finding a lot of younger people are moving in because their parents live in the area."
Ultra's five-storey podium will include street-level shops facing Sheppard Avenue.
Private facilities for residents will include a gym, saunas, a party room, sports lounge and theatre, as well as guest suites, a lobby with a 24-hour concierge and a car-wash bay in the underground garage.
By the time Ultra is ready for occupancy in December, 2012, a separate recreation centre for the entire complex will be completed. It will contain a swimming pool, whirlpool and change rooms.
The latest tower will house 413 suites, with plans ranging from one to two bedrooms, with or without dens. Two-storey units are also available.
Designs will incorporate balconies as well as combined living and dining rooms.Standard features include laminate flooring in the living areas, sisal carpeting or 40-ounce broadloom in the bedrooms, and ceramic finishes in the bathrooms. The latter also will have cultured marble countertops.
The contemporary kitchens will feature granite countertops, ceramic backsplashes and stainless-steel appliances. Pantries, islands and breakfast bars are included in some plans.
As a member of the Canada Green Building Council, Monarch will incorporate eco-friendly features and practices intended to reduce energy consumption, create a healthier indoor environment, and help residents save money on utility costs. Hydro will be individually metered; water-saving showerheads, low-E windows, and an automated system to sort waste and recyclable materials will be installed; and paints with low emissions of volatile organic compounds will be used.
The price of each unit includes parking. There is a monthly fee of about 47 cents a square foot.

Full text:   Manufacturers are pitching synthetic lawns to U.S. homeowners who are fed up with maintenance, allergies and muddy paw prints
Jude Albanese doesn't pay a landscaper or run lots of sprinklers to maintain his lawn. He has retired his mower, and he doesn't use fertilizer. Yet the grass in front of his New Jersey home looks so lush that some passersby feel the need to bend down and touch it.
The reason is simple: The grass is fake.
"You want to enjoy your yard, but it was always work and upkeep," says the Nutley, N.J., homeowner, who had JM Synthetic Grass Surfacing install his faux lawn last month. "Now it's much cleaner and neater. I should have done this years ago."
The synthetic-turf industry, known for AstroTurf and other versions of faux grass in stadiums and on athletic fields, is increasingly targeting the residential market. For several years, people have been turning to faux lawns in areas of the Southwestern U.S. to conserve water. Now, manufacturers are increasingly pitching them to homeowners around the country who are fed up with maintenance, allergies, or muddy paw prints all over the house from the family dog. Artificial turf is convenient, the companies say, and moreover, it saves water and cuts down on fertilizer use.
But others say faux grass is anything but green. Lead has been found in turf-covered athletic fields, and environmental groups and parents have raised concerns over the chemicals found in the turf's recycled-tire infill. (Infill refers to the loose particles sprinkled into the faux grass after it is installed to help keep the blades upright and the product in place.) The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and the country's Environmental Protection Agency recently began looking into the safety of artificial turf products.
Some neighbours, meanwhile, simply find the idea of plastic grass tacky.
Companies say their artificial-turf products are safe.
And to address the nagging problem of taste, some of the latest products are made to look more realistic, with irregular blades, colour variations or a smattering of brown grass mixed in.
"I'm seeing designers and landscape architects starting to use it," says Susan Welti, a landscape designer in Manhattan and Brooklyn, who suggested it last year for an area that didn't get enough sunlight for real grass. "It can be incredibly good for these little yards." But given the recent health questions, she says she's still viewing it cautiously.
Clearly, fake grass is taking root among some homeowners. According to data provided by the Association of Synthetic Grass Installers, a trade association based in Sacramento, Calif., sales of artificial turf for landscapes and putting greens, a category that includes residential lawns, has grown at 35 per cent annually for the past five years.
One manufacturer of the latest fake turf is Textile Management Associates, based in Dalton, Ga., which makes SYNLawn. It offers varieties including SynFescue, SynRye and SynBlue. The blades are made from nylon or polyethylene: petroleum-based products. The company says it is moving toward more eco-friendly materials: It is now using soy-based backing for most products, instead of one made from petro-based products. It also recently introduced a turf product specifically for homeowners who keep pets in the yard, with an antibacterial agent to minimize odours.
ForeverLawn, based in Albuquerque, N.M., adds bits of fake brown grass to look like dead thatch and thus make the lawn more realistic. It also recently rolled out K9Grass, geared specifically for areas with pets, like dog runs. It has antimicrobial properties and a porous backing, "so dog pee goes right through," says ForeverLawn co-owner Dale Karmie.
The latest faux grass products go for roughly $6 to $12 (U.S.) a square foot with installation, according to estimates by the companies. While it can cost a homeowner about $10,000 for a yard, some say it's worth it, given the savings in landscaping fees, mower gas and fertilizer - as well as the extra time they have on weekends.
"No cutting, no bagging, no push-behind mowers," says Mr. Albanese. Instead of working on the lawn all day, he says, "now we can sit outside and have barbecues."
Worries surfaced earlier this year over possible health and environmental risks of sports fields covered with artificial turf, and the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the Environmental Protection Agency began to look into the issue. But "there is still considerable uncertainty over the possible exposure to hazardous substances including lead from synthetic turf," says an EPA spokesman.
As for infection risk, faux grass hasn't been shown to be especially prone to harbour dangerous microbes such as the superbug known as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, or MRSA, says Jeff Hageman, an epidemiologist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, he says, athletes and others involved in physical activity on any field should take precautions against abrasion and infection by wearing protective clothing and treating cuts promptly.
The latest faux grass products for residential lawns are similar to those found on athletic fields. Ground-up tire is used in athletic turfs as infill to provide sponginess and minimize injury. Artificial turf for private lawns, meanwhile, can contain ground-up tire as infill, but sand is often used instead.
New Jersey state health officials last year and this spring found elevated levels of lead in several artificial-turf playing fields, leading to closures. Parents and environmental advocates nationwide have also argued against the turf's installation at local schools, citing health concerns. They worry about kids inhaling chemicals and traces of metals found in the ground-up tires used as padding.
The Synthetic Turf Council, an Atlanta-based group that represents the industry, concedes that there is lead chromate in many of their products, used to help colour the material that makes up the "blades." But only minimal amounts are used, the group says, and it's tightly encased, therefore posing no risk to the environment or to people using the lawn. The industry also says that the crumbs of ground-up tire rubber aren't hazardous and have been safely used in athletic fields for more than a decade. It points out that using them allows millions of tires to avoid landfills and be recycled.
Another drawback of the artificial turf is it gets hot. According to Stuart Gaffin, a research scientist at Columbia University's Center for Climate Systems Research who studies artificial turf fields, artificial turf can get about 60 degrees hotter than grass on hot and sunny days.
Mr. Karmie, of ForeverLawn, says his products aren't as cool as natural grass, but the heat "is not something that would keep you off it."
In some areas of the country, faux turf is seen as friendly to the environment because it saves water.
Dave Ewles spent about $10,000 putting synthetic turf on his lawn in Newport Beach, Calif., last year to cut water use and other maintenance hassles. But he says his homeowners' association objected for aesthetic and other reasons, and after much back-and-forth, Mr. Ewles recently agreed to have the faux grass torn up.
"Some people just don't like the idea of it," he says. A representative from the homeowners' association couldn't be reached for comment.
Melissa Guerin also found out that not everyone is interested in the convenience of a faux lawn. Because her children have allergies and her dog constantly tore up the yard, she last month installed artificial grass behind her townhouse in Weehawken, N.J. When she suggested to her neighbours that it might be a good idea for the common lawns, too, she didn't expect the outcry she got from some neighbours.
She received a few heated e-mails, one asking her how she could even suggest it when others are trying to save the environment. Another neighbour feared it would look "tacky." Even though some residents were interested, the idea was eventually scrapped.
"I resented the fact they insinuated I don't care about the planet," says Ms. Guerin, who points out faux grass doesn't need water or fertilizer. "If the point is to make your neighbourhood nice and uniform, a plastic lawn is one way to do it."

White Ironstone pottery: plentiful and a bargain

Author: Sewell, Diane

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/white-ironstone-pottery-plentiful-bargain/docview/382713166/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: Some white Ironstone is smooth and plain, while other pieces are embossed with patterns of wheat, corn, berries or flowers. The finials on the lids of covered dishes range from crowns to the ever popular beaver. Part of the appeal of white ironstone is its simplicity. And even if you're still a stickler for matched sets, it shouldn't much matter if your white Ironstone patterns aren't all the same. White is white, after all.

Full text:   You can actually use this durable, English snowy white ceramic, or just decorate with it, Diane Sewell writes
Want to get that feel of country charm for your cottage or farmhouse? In the first of a series on collecting antiques, Diane Sewell gives you advice on where to go, what to focus on and what to avoid as you search for your hidden treasures.
Outfitting your country place with the kinds of things that give it that homey, cottage feeling doesn't have to be expensive - or hard work. All you need is a little time, patience and imagination.
There are plenty of bargains to be had this time of year at local country auctions, flea markets, antique shops and shows, and even yard sales, and hunting for them can be a lot of fun. Roaming around the countryside on a sunny Saturday in search of a hidden treasure that whispers your name (and fits your budget) can be very rewarding - and the beginning of a hobby you can take just about anywhere, any time.
Collecting for the cottage means tossing your orderly, matching, colour-coded expectations to the wind. In the country, cheap, cheerful and imaginative wins the day.
One of the great antique bargains you might want to watch out for this summer is white Ironstone. Not only is it fairly inexpensive these days, it's also plentiful. And you can use it or just decorate with it.
This durable, English snowy white pottery became so popular in the 1840s that virtually every potter in England was making his own version of it.
Some pieces are marked and some aren't, but you can always recognize white Ironstone by its dense, heavy feeling. It's very tough stuff, which was a huge selling point in the 1800s since it was a practical alternative to the much more expensive and fragile porcelain. The same holds true today.
During your travels you'll likely come across all sorts of different pieces in white Ironstone, including teapots, plates, cups and saucers, assorted mixing and serving bowls, covered vegetable dishes, pitchers and platters, and of course the ubiquitous wash sets.
Everybody needed a wash set before running water, taps and sinks became commonplace and white Ironstone was very affordable. (Old single water pitchers make great vases and the enormous wash bowls superb salad or fruit bowls - after a thorough scrub of course.) There are also more ornamental pieces, like covered hens on the nest.
Some white Ironstone is smooth and plain, while other pieces are embossed with patterns of wheat, corn, berries or flowers. The finials on the lids of covered dishes range from crowns to the ever popular beaver. Part of the appeal of white ironstone is its simplicity. And even if you're still a stickler for matched sets, it shouldn't much matter if your white Ironstone patterns aren't all the same. White is white, after all.
There was more of this type of English pottery shipped to North America than any other type of ceramic, which explains why there's so much of it still around. If you don't mind a little chip here or a tiny hairline crack there, even bigger bargains can be found. (The hen on the nest pictured here, which has a small chip on it, was recently bought at a country auction for the bargain basement price of $17.)
That's not to say that all white Ironstone is cheap. There are definitely some rarities - and serious collectors for them as well. Different situations will also command different prices. High-end shops will most likely charge more than a flea market dealer. After all, their overhead is much higher. Still, keep looking because there are plenty of bargains to be had. Just say no if the price doesn't fit your budget.
Here are some ballpark 'bargain prices' you might expect to pay for white Ironstone: Lone dinner plates as little as $5. Water pitchers, depending on size, usually start at $30 (the bigger it is, the more expensive it is, as a rule), creamers as little as $5. Covered vegetable dishes are more expensive and range from $60 to more than $200, but bowls can sometimes be as inexpensive as $10.
Getting a super buy and taking the time to build a collection can be loads of fun. But remember, the thrill is always in the hunt.
Family tip
If you're bringing young children along, pick something inexpensive they can hunt for and collect, too. Building their own collections of, say, figural eggcups from the 1930s or tiny glass animals, will pique their interest, help minimize complaints, and make the outing a family affair.

Abstract: Kimco is enthusiastic about Canada particularly because things in the United States "aren't looking so hot these days," said Mr. [David Henry], Kimco's chief investment officer. "You've just got so much going for you relative to other places in the world today, so we like the long-term bet on Canada," he added, pointing to the country's natural resources, fiscal surplus, strong economy and growing employment rate.

Full text:   U.S. real estate executive David Henry is a frequent speaker on the conference circuit, and despite the gloom among some local industry watchers, his outlook for Canada seems to become more positive with each presentation.
His glowing comments recently prompted Thomas Hofstedter, chief executive officer of Toronto-based H & R Real Estate Investment Trust, to joke during a conference that Mr. Henry's firm, Kimco Realty Corp. of Long Island, N.Y., might even want to hook up with RioCan Real Estate Investment Trust , Canada's largest retail REIT.
"I'd never say never," Mr. Henry said in an interview yesterday when asked if his company would ever look at buying Toronto-based RioCan. "We love RioCan, and we continue to admire them."
But for now, Kimco is increasing its business in Canada by partnering with RioCan to buy 10 shopping centres from H & R for $156-million. It's their second joint venture, with the first in 2001 marking Kimco's initial entry into Canada.
Kimco is enthusiastic about Canada particularly because things in the United States "aren't looking so hot these days," said Mr. Henry, Kimco's chief investment officer. "You've just got so much going for you relative to other places in the world today, so we like the long-term bet on Canada," he added, pointing to the country's natural resources, fiscal surplus, strong economy and growing employment rate.
Kimco was founded in the 1950s with a handshake between chairman and chief executive officer Milton Cooper, now 79, and partner Martin Kimmel, who died in April.
In addition to Kimco's shrewd bet on the emerging popularity of the neighbourhood shopping centre, the company was early to recognize the potential of the modern REIT structure when it went public in 1991. "Uncle Milty truly is the grandfather of the U.S. REIT. He invented the modern REIT," said Anne MacLean, money manager at Toronto-based Groundlayer Capital Inc., who has had numerous conversations with Mr. Cooper over the years.
Kimco now has a market capitalization of $9.9-billion (U.S.), and is a member of the S & P 500-stock index. As of Dec. 31, 2007, it owned interests in nearly 2,000 properties across 45 U.S. states, Puerto Rico, Canada, Mexico and Chile. This week, Kimco closed its first deal in Peru.
After entering Canada seven years ago, Kimco acquired equity interests in about 150 properties valued at about $2-billion (Canadian). This includes straight property purchases, along with other forms of ownership including participating loans and development activities. Including yesterday's acquisition, Canada will represent up to 7.5 per cent of Kimco's yearly revenue.
"We've still got lots of room to go," Mr. Henry said. He said Kimco will continue to look for "opportunistic" investments, and may bring in some of its U.S. and international clients to help it compete on future deals.
While Canadian consumers are in better shape than their counterparts in many U.S. states, the picture isn't entirely rosy. High gas prices, the manufacturing sector slump and other issues could dampen consumer spending, but apparently not Kimco's appetite for Canadian real estate.
"Historically, Canada has always caught a cold if we caught a cold. But I think you're less inter-related with the U.S. than you were in the past. I think you've got so many positive things going for you on a relative basis you're going to do just fine," Mr. Henry said.

Full text:   Victoria-area strip plaza to get a $1-billion makeover into a suburban city centre - but it will take 20 years
Colwood Corners is an aging, unassuming strip plaza on the fringe of Greater Victoria with an exciting future - but it will take some time to come to full fruition.
Colwood city council gave its final stamp of approval last week for a land rezoning that paves the way for a planned $1-billion redevelopment of the 13-acre site on the western shore of Vancouver Island. Four single-storey buildings that are now there will be replaced with 11 buildings totalling 3.5 million square feet. City Centre Colwood, as the development will be called, will include new office and residential buildings, a shopping, dining and entertainment district, and substantial underground parking.
Construction is expected to begin early next year but the 20-year timeline for the project means the much-anticipated - and sometimes hotly contested - transformation won't happen overnight.
"If you're looking for instant gratification, you're not going to get it with this project," said Les Bjola, principal of Turner Lane Development Corp. of Victoria. But that's partly why Mr. Bjola partnered with Adam Gant and Emanuel Arruda of Victoria-based League Assets Corp. for the project.
"They understand that it's not an overnight event, it's a long-term relationship," Mr. Bjola said. "They've got a very solid understanding of how they have to go about it. ... They have done smaller projects that show me they understand it's a work in progress, it's not a one-time thing."
Colwood Plaza marked an evolution for League, however.
The company's long-term approach to commercial property investment traditionally has focused on rejuvenating assets through wise management - identifying strategies to improve the use of space and securing tenants willing to pay higher rents at sites that League has remade into desirable destinations.
"We don't like to buy an asset that we'll sell again the next year," said Mr. Gant, chief executive officer of League. "We're looking at ways of creating value and at the end of the day having an asset we can hold on to."
This was the case in Campbell River, a growing community on Vancouver Island where League acquired Tyee Plaza in June, 2007, for $14.25-million. Campbell River's recovery from economic hard times made it an attractive location for Shoppers Drug Mart, which has agreed to develop a 17,000-square-foot store at the shopping centre.
The new construction will make better use of the property and add appeal for local shoppers as well, all of which increase the property's value. Current company estimates peg the appreciation at $5-million by the end of this year.
What makes the Colwood project different is that it moves League from being a mere investor to being a development partner on a project that capitalizes on the growing desirability of Victoria's West Shore among developers.
"Even though we're a REIT, we're actually becoming more of a real estate development finance company than just a straight asset manager," Mr. Gant explained.
The partnership with Mr. Bjola allows League to capitalize on the redevelopment potential of a 14.1-acre site in the heart of an area that's seeing some lift from its proximity to the 1,500-acre Bear Mountain Resort development. The rapid growth at Bear Mountain has cast adjacent neighbourhoods in a favourable light, Mr. Gant believes, making nearby Colwood a good bet for League.
Founded in 2004, League also applies its long-term approach to the management of IGW Real Estate Investment Trust, a fast-growing private trust that League launched in January, 2007.
Since then, IGW has acquired nearly $200-million in assets, mostly commercial properties, in British Columbia, Alberta and Ontario.
League, as manager, limits its interest in IGW's properties to a 20-per-cent stake in the appreciation of the properties' value on their sale. This ties the principals' compensation to the performance of the assets within IGW's portfolio.
Marvin Quiring, a resident of Chase, B.C., and an early investor in League's portfolio, said the firm's approach commands a respect he believes not many other real estate investment companies enjoy.
"Their [philosophy] is always based on us getting our money first, and that is totally unique," said Mr. Quiring, a professional counsellor by training who has been active in several businesses and most recently served as a vice-president of Saskatoon-based Cover-All Building Systems Inc.
It's an approach Mr. Gant and Mr. Arruda didn't learn in business school.
Raised in Kelowna, B.C., Mr. Gant studied engineering at the University of British Columbia and was a competitive rower, representing Canada at the under-23 world rowing championships in Italy in 2002.
Mr. Arruda studied science at the University of Toronto and, after graduating, ran his own international marketing firm for 10 years.
Both men resist further prodding about their backgrounds, preferring a low profile (disclosing not even their ages) and letting League's performance speak for itself. When a Victoria newspaper wanted to recognize them among the city's rising business leaders, they declined because the profile would have been more about themselves than about League.
But their principled approach to investing and savvy about what investors are looking for - and how to deliver it - bodes well for their future, Mr. Quiring said, especially because they aren't afraid to seek outside help or partnerships, such as the one with Mr. Bjola, to achieve their goals.
"Why they're going to continue to be successful is they don't feel they've got all the answers," Mr. Quiring said. "These guys are not proud. They're not beyond asking: 'What do you think?' "

Full text:   The number of foreclosed homes owned by lenders continues to rise despite signs that they are increasingly willing to slash prices to sell those properties.
Lenders and investors in mortgages owned about 660,000 foreclosed homes in April, up from 493,000 in January and 231,000 in January, 2007, according to First American CoreLogic, a research firm based in Santa Ana, Calif., that collects data from lenders and county clerks. The April total works out to about one in seven previously occupied homes available for sale nationwide in the United States.
A surge in defaults has increased the inventory of bank-owned homes, known in the trade as REO, for "real estate owned." By cutting prices, lenders have managed to increase sales of such homes sharply in recent months in some cities hit hard by foreclosures, including Las Vegas, Detroit and Sacramento, Calif., local real estate brokers say.
With home prices falling, "holding the assets means further losses," said Mark Fleming, chief economist for First American CoreLogic. Some lenders now are cutting prices as often as every 20 days on homes that aren't selling, said David McCarthy, chief executive officer of Integrated Asset Services LLC, a Denver-based company that helps banks value and sell REO homes.
But lenders haven't yet managed to catch up with the inflow of foreclosed homes. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Economy.com, forecasts that the inventory of REO homes won't peak before the end of 2009.
In dollar terms, foreclosed one- to four-family homes owned by lenders whose deposits are insured by the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. more than doubled to $8.56-billion (U.S.) at the end of the first quarter from $3.59-billion a year earlier.
The REO glut is weighing on house prices in many areas, as banks tend to cut prices faster than other sellers. A new set of local home price indexes, to be introduced this week by Integrated Asset Services, shows that the median price of homes sold in Riverside County, Calif., in April was down about 29 per cent from a year earlier. The median price fell about 13 per cent in Clark County, Nev., and 12 per cent in Arizona's Maricopa and Pima counties.
To avoid or at least delay losses, many lenders are trying to avert foreclosures by easing loan terms or giving struggling borrowers more time to catch up. Hope Now, an alliance of mortgage companies and investors, said last week that mortgage companies completed loan workouts for 183,000 households in April, up from 160,000 in March.
Meanwhile, long-term interest rates rose last week, marking another potential drag on the housing market. The average rate on 30-year fixed rate loans eligible for sale to government-sponsored investors Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was 6.17 per cent, up from 6.02 per cent a week earlier.

Full text:   Not wanted in Vancouver, a controversial sculpture will have a new home in Alberta
One person's Cowtown can be another's cultural saviour. Witness the sculpture Vancouverites lovingly (and sometimes not so lovingly) refer to as the upside-down church. It will be dismantled in Vancouver this week and begin a journey to Calgary, where it will be resurrected by the Glenbow Museum. An official announcement will be made today.
The future of the work of public art - actual name Device to Root Out Evil - became uncertain earlier this spring when the Vancouver Park Board commissioners voted unanimously to remove it from Harbour Green Park, its home since the Vancouver Sculpture Biennale of 2005-2007.
It was not the first time the sculpture, by New York artist Dennis Oppenheim, has encountered opposition.
Originally unveiled at the prestigious Venice Biennale in 1997, the work went on to spark a debate of biblical proportions back home in America. Oppenheim's alma mater, Stanford University, didn't want the controversial sculpture on its grounds. (Note the upside-down steeple pointing into the ground - a symbol the not-religious Oppenheim insists is supportive of religion in that it suggests the church has hell in its sight).
While some U.S. Christians denounced the sculpture as blasphemous, the problem in Vancouver wasn't so much religion as it was real estate. Residents of the spiffy Coal Harbour neighbourhood complained that the more than six-metre-tall (and wide) statue obstructed their scenic view. The Park Board agreed.
John Bromley with Benefic Group, the philanthropy-focused law firm in Vancouver that owns the sculpture, didn't. "The condos seem to block the water more than the sculpture does," he says.
Following the Vancouver debate from New York, Oppenheim was taken aback by the debate in Vancouver - a city he took to be culturally enlightened. "I liked where it was, I liked the city and it was a shock to hear that it was going to move. I didn't expect it," Oppenheim said in an interview on Friday.
Even before the final vote, Bromley, suspecting things were going to go this way, began quietly entertaining offers for a new home for the large sculpture. "I own the piece and I don't have a big enough garage to store it in."
Some of the offers were local, but Bromley ultimately made a deal for a multi-year lease with the Glenbow - under the tutelage now of Jeffrey Spalding, who's determined to make the museum more relevant and exciting Bromley would have liked the statue to stay in Vancouver, where he lives - especially with the Winter Olympics coming to the city in 2010.
But there's part of him that feels moving it to another city will spark a badly-needed debate in his hometown.
"This isn't an 'up-yours, Vancouver' and we're not trying to be smug," Bromley says. "[But] if that piece got placed in another location in Vancouver ... the city would be in a position to have in my view made a bad decision as it relates to public art but still got the benefit of keeping this world-renowned piece in the city. And it may have never resulted in the review and debate around some of these policies that we're hoping a major loss like this to the city will stimulate."
He adds that he has absolute confidence in the Glenbow to deliver an interesting location and give the work its due. "Vancouver's loss is a big win for Calgary."
Oppenheim, whose works are in the permanent collections of prestigious institutions such as the Tate Gallery in London and the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Modern Art in New York, questions a process where a board responsible for running parks can have this much say in a cultural matter such as public art. He suggests Vancouver re-examine the mechanism that led to the loss of this work.
The sculptor (who has developed an artist's thick skin over this matter and others) isn't so much offended by what has happened as he is disappointed - and surprised.
"It's ironic that this work that sort of has religious overtones is going to a Bible Belt community in the middle of Canada. I mean [it's leaving] the sophisticated city of Vancouver and is now being applauded in the Bible Belt where people are usually endowed with highly religious motives."
The sculpture is to be dismantled beginning tomorrow and then transported to Calgary. Details of its installation in Calgary will be announced at a later date. Oppenheim says he'll be there.
"I think Calgary looks as if it's going to become a major Canadian art city, so in that respect I'm quite pleased that it's going there."

Full text:   Midnight chic reigned at decadent spring gala, reports Deirdre Kelly. Photography by Janice Pinto
Black might suggest an absence of colour. But black sizzled when worn by a bevy of beauties who made last week's fundraiser benefiting the Gerry & Nancy Pencer Brain Tumour Centre at Princess Margaret Hospital a saucily vibrant affair.
Blame it on the black mesh stockings. But "Noir," as the spring gala was called, netted the charity more than $600,000, through ticket sales and live and silent auctions featuring such luxury items as the $23,000 black-and-white diamond necklace that local jeweller Isabella Briatico created for the event.
The stones' sparkle made them easy to see inside the darkened interior of the Liberty Grand Entertainment Complex, where everything was done up in shades of midnight chic, including the pedestal-like stages for the male and female disco dancers, who wore black and lots of obsidian-hard attitude, but little else.
Stylish, sexy, powerful, mysterious, depraved: Black was a theme open to interpretation. Guests arrived (late, as a result of a pileup on the Lake Shore) in a range of party garb, from the Edward Gorey-inspired frock coat on jazz singer Jake Rude, to the merry-widow corset dress on Lisa Frankfort, the voluptuous vice-president of Cosmopolitan Homes.
There were a few holdouts, such as the evening's hostess, Nancy Pencer, who wore look-at-me silver; high-octane performer Darren Smith, who donned tight, red funkadelic pants; and real-estate agent Elli Davis, who was attired in a white linen pantsuit.
"It's the new black," Ms. Davis declared. "I've always been a little contrary."

Full text:   One big culprit in the global food crisis has been overlooked: The money. Pension and index funds used a loophole to plow hundreds of billions of dollars into commodities markets
Tom Giessel rubs the heel of his palm against his forehead, exhales a moment, and then begins again, trying to make sense of how the global food market has suddenly descended into chaos.
He is seated on a couch in his modest white farmhouse, surrounded by acres of wheat that in a few days will begin to flower, blanketing this central Kansas town with millions of tiny green beards. Beside him, a sheaf of dried wheat spills out of a vase, while across the room, a stylized crucifix looms above the entrance to the kitchen, a solitary stem writhing on the cross.
For three generations, grain has been his family's lifeblood, a source of sustenance and pride, reward and hardship.
Mr. Giessel, 55, lived through the Russian Wheat Deal in the 1970s, when a sudden rise in exports to the Soviet Union sparked a boom in prices. He has endured credit crises, political embargoes, and the vicissitudes of weather and drought.
Yet in the more than 3½ decades he has been farming, he has never seen anything quite like this. The prices of wheat, corn, soybeans and rice more than doubled in value in the span of several months, sowing equal measures of confusion and fear in the American heartland. Commodities markets, where these prices take their cue, have become so unpredictable that farmers now liken them to blackjack tables in Las Vegas.
At the same time, the costs of fertilizer, herbicides and fuel - all crucial to agriculture - have skyrocketed to record heights: Mr. Giessel's expenses alone jumped half a million dollars in the past year, twice what they normally are.
"It used to be that I could figure on things from year to year," shrugs Mr. Giessel, a stout man with dark eyes, thick forearms and a weathered countenance. "But now it's like driving down the road with no headlights. You can look out the window and see the white lines, but you don't know what the hell you're going to hit. This is the most risk I've been exposed to since I started farming."
The problems here go well beyond the Kansas border. The record escalation of food prices has played havoc with every link in the food chain, from grain merchants to futures markets, from publicly traded food companies to consumers.
Producers such as Mr. Giessel now find themselves on the front line of a mushrooming global crisis, one that has sparked violent protests in some of the world's poorest countries, prompting aid agencies to warn of a pending humanitarian catastrophe.
In the search for answers, pundits have attempted to pin the blame on the usual suspects: rising demand from China and India, bad crop conditions and booming ethanol production.
Yet one major culprit behind these gyrating markets and unprecedented price spikes has been largely overlooked: the deep-pocketed pension and index funds upon which most Canadians and Americans depend for their retirements.
These funds have plowed tens of billions of dollars into agricultural commodities as a way to diversify their assets and improve returns for their investors.
The amount of fund money invested in commodity indexes has climbed from just $13-billion (U.S.) in 2003 to a staggering $260-billion in March, 2008, according to calculations based on regulatory filings.
Michael Masters, a veteran U.S. hedge fund manager, warned a Senate hearing this month that this number could easily quadruple to $1-trillion, if pension funds allocate a greater portion of their portfolio to commodities, as some consultants suggest they are poised to do. Because agricultural markets are small - relative to stock markets - the amount of cash pouring in gives these funds substantial clout. Mr. Masters estimated that that these big institutional investors control enough wheat futures to supply the needs of American consumers for the next two years, and blamed the "demand shock" from these recent entrants to the commodities markets as arguably the primary factor behind the sudden take-off in food prices.
"If immediate action is not taken, food and energy prices will rise higher still," he told the hearing. "This could have catastrophic economic effects on millions of already stressed U.S. consumers. It literally could mean starvation for millions of the world's poor."
The massive influx of cash has only occurred in the past few years. But its roots stretch back to the Reagan era, when a court battle over oil price manipulation set off a domino effect that would ultimately transform the arcane world of commodities trading.
Beginning with the energy market, regulators made a series of far-reaching decisions that gradually loosened oversight of complex commodity derivatives and created loopholes for large speculators, allowing them to trade virtually unlimited amounts of corn, wheat and other food futures.
Only now, nearly two decades later, are the full consequences of those decisions being felt.
We're Not in Kansas
Any more
For months, governments and international bodies have been struggling to avert catastrophe. The United Nations created a special task force on food security and called for emergency donations. Leaders of the world's wealthiest countries are expected to make the food crisis a priority when they gather for a G8 summit in July.
And the U.S. Congress has convened hearings into the matter, as have various other governmental and regulatory bodies around the world, all in an attempt to understand how markets and prices careened out of control.
They would do well to ask Fowler West. At a pivotal moment almost 20 years ago, Mr. West warned that a series of rapid-fire moves to deregulate commodities trading could wreak unintended - and perhaps calamitous - effects on these markets.
His alarms went unheeded.
In the early 1990s, Mr. West held a seat as a commissioner on the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the U.S. regulator charged with overseeing trading in hundreds of staple items, from corn and wheat to oil and cotton. Mr. West was a lifelong Democrat; his boss, CFTC chair Wendy Gramm, was a devout Republican and a believer in the laissez-faire, free-market philosophy espoused by president Ronald Reagan, who once described her as his "favourite economist."
In the fall of 1990, the two clashed over the CFTC's response to a New York court decision involving a little-known Bermuda energy company called Transnor Ltd.
Long forgotten by most, Transnor paved the way for wide-ranging deregulation of commodities trading, an effort that helped to spur the rise of Enron Corp. and which has enabled the stampede of large fund speculators into food markets.
In the winter of 1986, Transnor filed suit against some of the world's largest oil companies, alleging that they manipulated prices on the Brent market, an informal oil trading system that at the time determined the daily price of oil.
At first, few paid attention to the lawsuit. That all changed on April 18, 1990, when Judge William Conner delivered a stunning ruling midway through the trial.
The case hinged on drawing a key distinction: Were the 15-day oil contracts that traded on the Brent market "forward contracts" or "futures contracts"?
In a forward contract, the buyer and seller agree to the price of a commodity and a fixed date for delivery. A farmer enters into a forward contract with a food company by promising to deliver a certain amount of grain on a certain date at a certain price. Lawmakers have shied away from regulating forward contracts under commodity trading laws because they are a fundamental part of how farmers and food companies do business - and each agreement is unique.
A futures contract is the same basic agreement, but it trades on an exchange, and the buyer rarely - if ever - takes delivery of the commodities. Instead, futures contracts are used mainly by farmers for hedging and by investors for speculating. These contracts have historically been regulated.
In the Brent case, the difference was crucial, since the Brent market contracts did not trade on any exchange and, in the U.S., were not regulated by the CFTC.
The oil companies, hoping to protect their cozy market, and avoid the red tape and transparency requirements of regulation, argued they were forward contracts.
Judge Conner ruled against the companies, effectively rendering all Brent trading in the U.S. illegal.
Within days, international oil companies stopped trading with U.S. companies and the entire Brent market was verging on collapse.
In Washington, oil industry lobbyists descended on the CFTC, seeking to get the regulator to mitigate Judge Conner's ruling. They found a receptive ear in Ms. Gramm, the commission chair. Ms. Gramm served as a director at the Office of Management and Budget, spearheading a variety of industry deregulation efforts before President Reagan placed her in charge of the CFTC in 1988.
She arrived with other political credentials: her husband, Phil, who is now a senior economic adviser to presidential candidate John McCain, was a Republican senator from Texas.
Even before the Transnor case, Ms. Gramm had started pursuing a deregulation agenda at the CFTC. A year earlier, in 1989, the commission quietly issued a policy statement on swap transactions, deals in which a buyer of commodities such as a pension fund acts through a middleman or a swap dealer - usually a bank. The CFTC declared that it wouldn't regulate swap dealers.
The Transnor case represented another crucial win for financial speculators such as swap dealers. When the court decision was handed down, Ms. Gramm moved quickly to soften the blow to the energy sector, and turned the Transnor decision from an obscure footnote in the history of oil trading into a critical launching pad for a wide-ranging redrawing of the rules of commodities markets.
On Sept. 25, 1990, a policy confirming that the Brent contracts were forward contracts - and therefore, outside the scope of CFTC regulation - was put to a vote among CFTC commissioners.
It passed 3 to 1.
Ms. Gramm faced one vocal critic in her push to keep the Brent market unregulated: Fowler West, the lone 'no' vote.
"It was the way we were doing it, the speed with which we were doing it," Mr. West recalled in an interview. "It was that kind of an attitude that did open the door up for a lot of problems."
Ms. Gramm defends the CFTC's actions, and says the commission faced pressure from Congress to act. Senior CFTC staff, as well as a majority of commissioners, agreed with the interpretation concerning forward contracts, she noted.
"I don't think it was done too quickly," Ms. Gramm, who now chairs the Regulatory Studies Program at George Mason University's Mercatus Center, told The Globe and Mail in an interview.
Mr. West, meanwhile, wasn't merely outvoted. He was muzzled.
Although he wrote an official dissent after the vote, Ms. Gramm and the other commissioners blocked his views from being published in the CFTC's official record.
Furious, Mr. West retaliated by voicing his concern about the CFTC's moves to the New York State Bar Association. The regulator, he told the lawyers' group, "may soon be paying a price for its politically expedient statutory interpretation. I doubt that its new forward contract exemption can be restricted to large international oil and trading firms represented by influential lawyers."
He concluded with an ominous warning: "The public, down the road, will suffer from this fit of deregulation, no matter how well intentioned."
Mr. West's remarks were published in a law journal, and the efforts by the CFTC to quiet him stirred a furor in D.C. legal circles.
Two years later, Congress amended the Commodity Exchange Act to require the CFTC to publish dissenting opinions.
Into the promised land
of deregulation
Much as Mr. West predicted, the Transnor case proved to be a watershed event. The CFTC's embrace of a narrow definition of a futures contract built on the regulator's earlier promise that it would not police swap transactions.
Together, these moves opened up a new frontier of commodity trading, enabling financial speculators to buy and sell complex derivatives away from the prying eyes of regulators and exchanges.
For these dealers in the late 1980s and 1990s, the shrinking CFTC rulebook created a "virtually regulation-free promised land," Philip McBride Johnson, who was CFTC chairman from 1981 to 1983, later told a congressional committee.
The vast majority of this trading boom occurred in the oil and energy markets, both of which are sufficiently large and liquid to accommodate legions of traders.
It wasn't long before dealers began gravitating toward the smaller agricultural commodities markets as well.
To get exposure to a broad array of commodities, many institutional investors preferred to invest in an index that tracked the futures market. These indexes typically comprise a basket of products, from oil and gas to wheat, cotton, and precious metals, each given a weighting according to the size of its individual market.
As funds began making more and more index investments, their ownership of food futures increased correspondingly.
Yet the food markets are a somewhat different beast, with a different set of rules, and it wasn't long before this infusion of money hit another regulatory snag.
For almost 75 years, the CFTC has imposed limits on how much of certain agricultural commodities, including wheat, cotton, soybean, soybean meal, corn, and oats, can be traded by non-commercial players - that is, investors who are not part of the food industry. So-called "commercial hedgers," like farmers or food processors, can trade unlimited amounts in order to manage their risk.
The limits were designed to prevent manipulation and distortion in what are relatively small markets, and at the same time to allow for a small amount of speculative activity, in order to provide liquidity for trading.
For decades, the restrictions didn't pose much of a problem. And then, in 1991, as new money began pouring in, the playing field suddenly shifted.
Emboldened by the CFTC's laissez-faire approach, a bank approached the regulator and, for the first time, requested an exemption from speculative trading limits in an agricultural commodity.
The unnamed bank was acting as a "swap dealer" for a pension fund: Essentially, it was a middleman who helped the pension fund get exposure to commodities. A spokesman for the regulator declined to identify the bank or the pension plan, citing confidentiality requirements.
Understanding how a swap transaction like this works is critical to grasping why the CFTC ultimately granted an exemption to this bank - and in so doing, opened a loophole that has since allowed hundreds of billions of dollars worth of fund money to rush into the commodities markets.
Let's say a pension fund wants to make a large investment in commodities, but the size of that investment would violate the trading limits on wheat. Rather than invest directly in the futures market, the fund can invest its money with a middleman, such as a bank, in what is called a swap transaction.
The bank might agree to pay the fund a return on a commodity index - if the index rises 10 per cent in the next year, the bank will pay out that 10 per cent. But the bank doesn't want to be on the hook for 10 per cent, so it hedges its risk by wading into the commodities market, and using the fund's money to buy futures. Essentially, it is buying futures to mirror the performance of the index, so that if prices rise, it can pass that gain along to the fund without digging into its own pocket.
It is this notion of a middleman that swayed the CFTC. Had the pension fund invested all of its money directly in futures, it would not be allowed to exceed the trading threshold.
But the swap dealer was a different story. The CFTC ruled that it was only buying futures to hedge its risk with the pension fund client; therefore, much like a food industry hedger, it deserved to be exempt too.
The move was further evidence of the regulator's hands-off approach under Ms. Gramm. Since that time, the regulator confirmed it has approved 20 additional exemptions for swap dealers, some of whom may strike agreements with multiple funds.
"The underlying philosophy seemed to be that the big guy could take care of himself and there was no need for a lot of regulation," Mr. West recalled.
"It was actually told to me by the chairwoman that these [big companies] don't need us regulating them and hampering them, because they can take care of themselves. That missed the point. The point was, sure they can take care of themselves - but it wasn't them I was worried about."
Still, despite this apparently favourable treatment, many swap dealers and derivatives traders remained nervous: Although the CFTC had provided welcome assurances, the regulator did not have the formal power to enshrine these exemptions as binding rules.
Brokerage firms, energy traders and other financial players aggressively lobbied Congress on the issue, and in 1992, the U.S. government passed new legislation that enabled the CFTC to determine which derivatives could be considered forward contracts and receive exemptions.
Armed with this new power, the CFTC quickly handed out nine different exemptions for certain energy contracts. One of the recipients was a Houston-based pipeline entity called Enron Corp. that was branching out into the energy trading arena.
In January 1993, just as President Bill Clinton was being inaugurated, Ms. Gramm left the CFTC. Five weeks later she joined the board of Enron.
Congress, however, wasn't done. In 2000, it introduced an array of exemptions, including one for electronic trading of energy contracts. This new rule, which prompted the creation of numerous over-the-counter trading systems allowing buyers and sellers to avoid scrutiny, was later given a nickname: the Enron Loophole.
Beyond the Enron Loophole
Oddly enough, the CFTC's decision to exempt swap dealers from trading limits did not incite an immediate rush of fund money into agricultural commodities.
Many pension plans, in particular, were still inherently conservative and viewed commodities as a high-risk playground better suited to speculators.
One of the earliest funds to venture into commodities futures was the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan. It began with a tentative $100-million (Canadian) investment in 1997, and is now one of the world's larger commodities investors, with about $3-billion committed.
Not long after Teachers made its first commodities investment, Leo de Bever, then a vice-president with the fund, acknowledged in a speech at a New York conference that the strategy was unconventional for a fund like his. "We are probably an exception, rather than the rule in North America," he said.
That didn't last long. Throughout the 1990s, pension funds from Japan to Canada began accumulating assets at a furious clip. Around the world, the bulging baby boom demographic was contributing record amounts of new money into pension plans and retirement funds. At the same time, pension funds were freed from the traditional shackles of fixed-income investments, like bonds, which produce low returns, and began depositing cash in stock markets, infrastructure and real estate.
This boosted returns, and added further bulk to their growing assets. Worldwide institutional fund assets have soared from around $200-billion (U.S.) in 1980 to over $20-trillion today.
But that growth didn't come without setbacks. The dot-com crash in 2001 wiped out billions of dollars worth of value, and offered a painful lesson in the need for further diversification. Suddenly, commodities emerged as a logical vehicle to help pension plans spread around their risk, and at the same time get a measure of protection against inflation.
It didn't hurt that when pension and index funds descended en masse into these markets, they found ready-made loopholes that enabled them to make much larger investments than they would otherwise have been able to.
Consider the scale of the increase over the past seven years.
In 2000, long-only speculative investors - that is, investors like these funds who are only betting that prices will climb higher - had committed about $4.7-billion to commodities, according to figures compiled by Gresham Investments, a New York firm specializing in commodities. That number has almost doubled every year since, hitting $80-billion in 2005, and $175-billion in 2007. As of today, most estimates peg total fund investment at approximately a quarter of a trillion dollars. Indeed, a study this month by Greenwich Associates found that almost 40 per cent of commodities investors have only been active in these markets for the past three years.
Meanwhile, as this fund money stormed in and demand rose, prices for a range of food staples, such as wheat, soybeans and corn, began escalating. Between 2000 and 2007, the price of wheat increased 147 per cent on the Chicago Board of Trade. Over the same period, corn increased 79 per cent and soybeans 72 per cent. In the past year, in particular, the price moves have been dramatic.The CFTC's moves to deregulate the sector, meanwhile, only inspired calls for more deregulation. As more funds piled in, stoking demand for agricultural futures contracts, speculators began clamouring for more flexibility with trading limits.
In 2005, the CFTC obliged by expanding trading limits on the amount of wheat, corn, oats and soybeans that traders could buy or sell at any one time on the futures markets.
Then, in 2006, Deutsche Bank and another undisclosed index fund operator asked the CFTC to exempt them from all trading limits, much as it had done for swap dealers.
The CFTC didn't provide an outright exemption, but gave these two funds pretty much the same thing: a "no-action letter," assuring the funds that they would not be subject to penalties if they breached the limits.
Last fall, after other funds began jockeying for similar treatment, the regulator issued a proposal to offer index and pension funds full exemptions, meaning they wouldn't have to go through a swap dealer to circumvent trading limits. The CFTC also asked for comments on a proposal to once again raise trading limits for speculative investors, such as hedge funds.
For many in the food industry, who had begun to suspect a strong link between the market's wild swings and this influx of new fund money, this was the last straw.
The One Hundred Years War
On a Tuesday morning in late April, a group of more than 100 people shoehorned themselves into a cramped conference room in the Washington headquarters of the CFTC. There were farmers and bakers, brokers and stock exchange officials, pension fund executives, professors, and even cotton growers, all convening for what was, by any measure, an extraordinary meeting: In the midst of skyrocketing prices for food and unheard of gyrations in futures contracts, the chief commodities regulator was trying to figure out whether the markets it oversees still worked properly.
Almost immediately, fault lines emerged between the "commercial" players - farmers, grain elevators, processors, and anyone else directly involved in the food chain - and "speculators" - index funds, pension plans, hedge funds, and other investors who buy futures to bet on price movements, but who never intend to take physical possession of the commodity.
One by one, the commercials took their turn at the microphone, ticking off a laundry list of grievances: Prices were moving too quickly and unpredictably; grain elevators were at their credit limit, depriving farmers of a primary source of hedging risk.
And, for some mysterious reason, the price of the futures contract was not converging with the underlying price of the cash commodity it represented when that contract drew close to expiration.
Can a market be trusted if prices soar the same day reports come out showing that there is an oversupply of that product, they asked. Is the market sound when prices shoot up 85 per cent in a matter of days and then fall back down again for no apparent reason? Almost to a person, these commercials laid a large portion of the blame at the feet of investment funds, particularly the pensions and indexers who are able to skirt trading limits.
Many in the food industry complained that these index funds don't behave like traditional speculators in commodity markets. Unlike hedge funds, which actively buy and sell contracts, and make bets on price increases and decreases, index funds are passive investors. They take positions in various commodities and hang on for extended periods, betting that prices will continue to go up. Critics claim that this has resulted in a kind of hoarding, and that the market no longer reacts the way it should to supply and demand factors.
"It's the National Corn Growers Association's opinion that large funds have an overwhelming influence in these markets," Gary Niemeyer, a representative for the NCGA, told the roundtable. "This thing is just getting totally out of hand. The money is unreal."
Few were more pointed in their criticisms than the cotton growers. Cotton isn't part of the global food crisis, nor is it suffering from diminished supplies. Yet in one 90-minute stretch this spring, the futures for this commodity jumped a full 25 per cent, confounding just about everyone in the industry.
Cotton volatility was held up as one of the clearest signs to date that soft commodity prices have become unhinged from market fundamentals, and may instead be reacting to the moves of large fund traders.
"This makes no sense," complained Billy Dunavunt, the long-time chairman of Dunavunt Enterprises, and the closest thing to a living legend the industry possesses. "The market is broken, it's out of whack, and someone has got to step in and give some relief."
The funds, not surprisingly, dismissed these charges as baseless, and argued their involvement added liquidity to the market, enabling farmers and food producers to offload unwanted risk.
"I did not see a convincing case that index money has changed the stated objectives of this market," insisted Bob Grier, a fund manager at Pimco, one of the biggest players in the agricultural commodities market.
The odd thing is, this meeting could have occurred 150 years ago, and it wouldn't have seemed out of place.
The modern-day commodities market was born in 1848, when 82 merchants banded together to create the Chicago Board of Trade. Until that point, the grain trade was unpredictable, at best, and utter chaos, at worse.
Buying did not take place in any organized fashion, and individual farmers tended to transact with separate parties, leading to wide discrepancies in pricing. Because farmers typically sold their wares after harvest, the glut of grain often resulted in low prices.
Chicago, with its nascent railway lines and proximity to the Great Lakes and Midwestern farming country, was a natural place to bring everyone together. For the first time, farmers could manage their risk in a systematic way: They would agree with a buyer to deliver grain, at some specific date in the future, at a specific price.
This was a forward contract. But it wasn't until almost 20 years later, in 1865, that a proper futures market took shape.
So popular did these contracts become in the late 19th century that hundreds of exchanges began popping up across the United States, specializing in everything from butter and eggs to wheat, cotton and livestock.
Soon, speculators began to pour into the market, making bets on whether commodities would rise or fall in value. They never had to take possession of the commodity, but could buy a future at one price, and then sell it days, weeks, or months later.
Almost from the start, there was controversy. "There was an orgy of speculation and market manipulation during the Civil War," Dan Morgan wrote in his book the Merchants of Grain . "The Board printed rules governing trading in 1869, but abuses of all kinds continued - fraud, bribery of telegraph operators to obtain confidential information (until coded messages were used), and the spreading of false rumours to influence prices. Outside the trading floor at Jackson and La Salle streets, bucket shops, not much different from bookie joints or other gambling establishments, flourished."
In Canada, meanwhile, farmers were so upset they pushed the government to create a national co-operative in order to avoid selling grain through futures markets altogether. Those efforts led to the formation of the Canadian Wheat Board in 1935.
Even today, North American farmers view speculators as gamblers, exchanging pieces of paper in hopes that prices will move the way they want them to, but never getting their hands dirty with the physical product.
Yet, despite this uneasy symbiosis, most would agree that speculation performs a vital role in the markets: If farmers or food producers want to hedge against their risk by selling a futures contract - say, to deliver wheat a year from now at $8 a bushel - they need speculators who are willing to buy the contract in a bet that prices will rise by the delivery date.
The question, going back to the infancy of the markets, was one of balance: How much speculation was necessary to allow the markets to function smoothly?
After the First World War, when wheat prices plunged, the farming industry blamed the speculators, accusing them of using short-selling tactics to drive down the market. Widespread instances of market manipulation, meanwhile, incited Congress to introduce bills attempting to eliminate futures trading altogether.
Although they were narrowly defeated, problems in the market highlighted the need for improved regulation, leading first to the Grain Futures Act of 1922, and then to the Commodities Exchange Act of 1936. The latter expanded the scope of regulation to cover other commodities, including cotton, and for the first time imposed limits on speculators to prevent manipulation or distortion of the market.
In other words, non-commercial traders in the futures market could only buy a certain amount of wheat, corn and other products covered under the act.
The measures were put in place to protect farmers, who have a couple of ways to manage their risk: They can participate directly in the futures market, or they can enter into a forward contract with a grain elevator, who promises to buy their crop at a certain price. (Canadian farmers sell most of their wheat through the wheat board, but they use a similar system for selling other crops, including canola). Directly trading in futures isn't all that popular for farmers, owing both to the complexity of the futures market and the capital required to manage a trading position.
Most farmers, like Mr. Giessel in Kansas, choose to enter forward contracts with grain elevators. Last September, for instance, he struck an agreement with a local co-op to sell a third of his 2008 wheat crop at $5.30 a bushel: a price that looked good at the time, and that looked horrible in the spring, when wheat moved close to $13. The grain elevator, once armed with this agreement, immediately sells futures in the market at roughly the same price to minimize its risk.
But here's the rub: Every time the futures price rises, the elevator must post an equivalent amount of money in the form of margin - a kind of goodwill bond in case the farmer has a problem delivering the physical crop.
That's fine if the price of wheat nudges up a few nickels. But when an elevator sells a futures contract at $6 a bushel, and that price doubles, it must then post an additional $6 worth of margin on every bushel. That means going to the bank for a very big loan, which is easier said than done in today's credit environment.
"A year ago, we're sitting here with a $7-million line of credit," said Kim Barnes, a hulking man who works as an assistant manager with the Pawnee County Co-op. "Now it's over $19.5-million. And our interest costs have gone from $7-million last year to $14-million this year. Last year, because we were in uncharted waters, the banks allowed you to come back to the well. But we've all been told this year that you've got to live within your means."
Translation? Most elevators will only accept futures contracts for this year, and won't offer contracts to farmers looking to lock in prices for their 2009 or 2010 crop, depriving them of a common risk management tool. Some elevators are only offering contracts 60 days out, while a few unlucky ones have fallen into insolvency, unable to meet margin calls as prices accelerated to record levels.
As if this unpredictability weren't bad enough, key input costs like fertilizer, fuel and herbicide have soared, affecting farmers on both sides of the border. These inputs are a bit like taxes: Once they go up, they stay up, regardless of whether commodity prices fall again, as they have already done in the wheat market. That can take a big bite out of profit if the commodities don't remain at their current high levels.
For farmers, this sudden unpredictability is proof that commodities markets are no longer doing what they were supposed to do. "The commodity market was designed to provide a forward pricing tool to protect ourselves," said Ian Wishart, a farmer in western Manitoba, "not to provide an opportunity for someone else to make profits."
In the lead up to the April meeting in Washington, the CFTC resisted the idea that ballooning fund investments were responsible for the dramatic upswing in commodity prices.
Yet given the outpouring of concern from farmers, the regulator wasn't taking any chances. At the meeting, acting chairman Walt Lukken said the CFTC would temporarily shelve plans to move ahead with two proposals: Raising the limits, once again, for speculative traders like hedge funds, and formalizing an exemption from any trading limits for index funds.
"I will be very cautious about moving forward with such initiatives at this time," Mr. Lukken said. "I believe that before acting, this agency must be certain that additional speculative pressures will not exacerbate the anomalies we are experiencing in these markets."
All Roads Lead to Rome
Next week, international leaders will gather in Rome for the High-Level Conference on World Food Security, hosted by the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, in an effort to bring the spiralling food crisis under control.
In a report leading up to the summit, the UN warned that 22 countries, including Eritrea, Niger, Comoros, Haiti and Liberia, are particularly vulnerable to the recent rise in food prices, and the agency is calling for urgent measures to ensure the world's poorest citizens have affordable access to food.
The UN has also acknowledged that the speculative money flowing into commodities markets could be wreaking havoc with prices, joining officials from other international bodies, including the World Bank, in drawing attention to the problem.
In the face of stiff criticism from U.S. agriculture and this widening concern abroad, current and former CFTC officials have insisted the massive movement of investors into commodities has not distorted the markets.
Ms. Gramm claimed that deregulation and changes to the futures market have nothing to do with today's rising food prices. That notion, she said, "is just plain flat wrong."
"Volatility in the futures market doesn't cause prices [to rise]," she said. "Futures markets are an indicator of what's going on in the cash market, not vice versa."
Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat who heads a subcommittee that is probing commodities prices, disputes this point of view. The CFTC, he said this week, hasn't addressed the issue of how this influx of money into futures markets has affected price.
"You monitor, you update, you study, and then you don't do a darn thing about it," Mr. Levin said.
Amid this controversy, there remains a growing sense that the CFTC will have to implement some measure of added regulation to address concerns about soaring prices.
In the aftermath of the subprime mortgage debacle, U.S. lawmakers are trying to usher in a new era of regulation and scrutiny - one that demands far greater transparency on exotic derivative instruments, whether they be tied to the housing bubble or the commodities markets.
This month, the Senate passed legislation aimed at closing the Enron loopholes and bringing electronic energy trading under the purview of the CFTC. Facing growing pressure to rein in soaring prices, the CFTC announced Thursday that it is investigating possible manipulation of crude oil prices by traders.
More than one farmer has pointed to the Federal Reserve's assistance in helping JPMorgan to buy troubled brokerage firm Bear Stearns, and openly wondered why the U.S. government couldn't make a similar intervention in the food market. Many would say the stakes are higher, and carry with them something of a moral obligation.
"The tsunami they refer to as the food crisis should be the wake-up call to all of us that we have to get our priorities right," said Diana Klemme, a vice-president and grain division director at Grain Service Corp., an Atlanta firm that advises farmers on risk management.
"It's not just about the Kansas wheat crop, or the Iowa corn crop," she said. "This is about the world. And it's hard for us to step back and say we have to put this in context."
Even farmers like Mr. Giessel, preoccupied as they are with pressing concerns at home, readily acknowledge that the problems with commodities trading resonate far beyond the heartland.
"We're commoditizing everything, and losing sight that it's food, that it's something people need," he said. "We're trading lives."

Abstract: The other problem is its "new Tory" design tone. Flat-topped Neomodernist houses in blocky ranges of cedar, concrete and steel are the new conservatism, this century's equivalent of the early-1900s tendency toward the "Stockbroker Tudor" and "Spanish Merchant Banker Revival" styles found in [Shaughnessy].

Full text:   Architect managed to break the grip of neighbourhood convention in designing a modern family home
Some called it the "Hemlocks and Hip Roof War," and it was not the finest hour in the history of Vancouver urban design. The early 1990s saw Westside Vancouver outrage about the cutting down of a few hundred mature trees, tied to widespread disgust at the construction of less than a hundred so-called monster homes in place of the woodsy small bungalows that had previously graced its streets.
As this sort of symbolic struggle often is, the objections to chopping down cedars and the construction of beige-painted, flat-topped houses masked a deeper and more troubling issue: race relations.
The early 1990s saw an influx of new immigrants to Vancouver from Taiwan and Hong Kong in the run-up to the 1997 return of the former Crown colony to China's rule. Unlike previous waves of Chinese immigrants to Vancouver - where a quarter of the population has been of Chinese descent since the founding of the city in 1886, when Chinese workers for the Canadian Pacific Railway were among the city's first residents - these newcomers from Asia were at the top, not the bottom, of the economic pile.
Newly arrived Chinese immigrants bought houses all around Point Grey, and then some of them adjusted both landscape and architecture to their own tastes, often tempered by an appreciation for feng shui . As a guide to building, feng shui is not that much different from the writings of Roman architect Vitruvius, the oldest and most influential architectural text in the Western tradition, who used a similar combination of superstition and common sense to guide fellow builders.
In some readings of feng shui , large trees are thought to drain energy, double front doors generate better luck than single portals, ocean and mountain views guarantee increased wealth. All this can be wrapped together with a general preference for flat roofs and a masonry look born of Chinese urban homes, as opposed to British half-timbered baronial seats.
The subsequent push-back from well-established and politically well-connected residents was fierce, resulting in some appalling City of Vancouver regulations that effectively banned flat roofs west of Cambie Street. These new rules preserved the Westside as a theme park cum preservation zone for the hip roof, the gable end, the cottage eave, and the faux-Brit in tweed clipping azaleas and chatting over hedgerows beneath towering Douglas firs, ensuring, year-round, that no more natural light would be available at grass level than Cheltenham receives on a November day.
One unintended victim of the poorly framed planning regulations was innovative architecture - and innovative architects, such as UBC graduate Clinton Cuddington. Mr. Cuddington and his wife, Monica Berdin, met as undergraduates studying environmental design in Winnipeg; he wanted to launch his own architectural practice in 2006 (after a decade working for Vancouver's Bing Thom) with a house for themselves and their two young children.
The couple was interested only in designing and building a modern-style house, and was worried that planning regulations would oblige them to craft something quaint and period revival.
Ms. Berdin's family in Calgary had provided the resources to buy a large lot with a 1940s knock-down bungalow on Wolfe Avenue, in the lower ranges of Old Shaughnessy, where Vancouver's Old Money tends to range.
The bad news was that neighbours were conservative, and design control regulations were in force. The good news was that a new generation of Vancouver municipal planners, and community advocates of Modernism such as former UBC architecture professor Abraham Rogatnick, were itching to find a design proposal that would challenge the area's orthodoxy of gable roofs and saccharine detail.
The recently finished Cuddington-Berdin home does just that. An extended lobbying effort on behalf of Mr. Cuddington's flat-topped design (Mr. Rogatnick became his advocate on the local review panel) resulted in the first Modernist house in Vancouver's toniest district in decades.
The house is not only flat-topped, but also uses lavish materials and boasts one of Vancouver's first single-family residential green roofs. There is lots of concrete and steel on show, and not a gable or voussoir anywhere in sight.
Despite early fears, most of the surprisingly few objections to Mr. Cuddington's design focused on how the house, garage and grounds met the busy street.
Coming off Wolfe Avenue, the driveway makes a sharp right turn, tucking the garage almost invisibly under decks and planters. The aggressive edge of the concrete walls here is tempered by having the design's main compositional foil - a house-spearing concrete wall - wrapped in white Chinese granite, echoing a similar treatment in stone fences throughout Shaughnessy.
The street-oriented forecourt is my favourite part of the residence. It is a richly modelled range of stairs, planters, decks and sculpture seats that rise from ground level to the main living level.
This synthesis of ideas from Mr. Cuddington with those of landscape architect Liz Watts redefines the entire idea of the front yard for this hilly part of town. Marvellous. (So marvellous, in fact, that the Shaughnessy design review board made him a member.)
The house, however, is not without design issues.
The most important is scale: it looks blown up by 20 per cent. Floor-to-floor heights seem too high, the details ungainly because oversized decks extend too far. Liveliness and livability have been sacrificed for sheer chutzpah.
The other problem is its "new Tory" design tone. Flat-topped Neomodernist houses in blocky ranges of cedar, concrete and steel are the new conservatism, this century's equivalent of the early-1900s tendency toward the "Stockbroker Tudor" and "Spanish Merchant Banker Revival" styles found in Shaughnessy.
Matthew Woodruff, with whom Mr. Cuddington formed Measured Architecture Inc. last year, recently won a B.C. Lieutenant-Governor's award for a very different design: a weekend retreat for his family on Mayne Island.
The island getaway is as modest and tiny in detail as the Wolfe Avenue design is swaggering and large. Of his getaway home, Mr. Woodruff said: "This is a project with a normal program, a normal budget, and a normal site for a normal family."
By contrast, the Wolfe Avenue house would seem to be non-normal in program, budget, site and family. Once these two designers combine their inherent strengths and lose their progressive conservatism, watch out.

Full text:   They're a more environmentally friendly option, say proponents of the round concrete structures
There's no doubt that Michael Goodwin's new home is the most unusual one in Lion's Head, Ont. On a quiet, bungalow-lined street in the small Bruce Peninsula town, his house stands out because it's capped by a bulbous concrete dome.
On its own, the dome would stick out like a sore thumb, but the conventional wings on either side help it blend in - somewhat - with the surrounding bungalows.
The house is entered through one wing, which also contains the bathroom. An artist specializing in driftwood sculpture, Mr. Goodwin has set up his workshop in the other wing.
The central dome is a combined bedroom, living room and kitchen.
But why live in a concrete dome?
Mr. Goodwin laughs, whips out his harmonica and begins to play. The sound reverberates, bouncing off the curved concrete walls and ceiling, and the effect is undeniably impressive.
"It was always in the back of my mind to build an adobe brick house," he says, relaxing in the dome, surrounded by his sculptures.
Prior to building the dome, he'd been living in an 1860s-era house in Southampton, Ont., on Lake Huron. One day he got to talking with a local café owner, Sunny Cushnie, who had recently returned from a dome-building workshop and was getting ready to build one of his own.
A modern method of building domes cast in one piece, or monolithic domes, was developed in the 1970s by David South and his brothers, who are builders in Italy, Tex. Mr. South was inspired by the geodesic domes promoted by the visionary Buckminster Fuller, and started investigating new dome-building techniques.
Monolithic domes begin with a concrete slab platform that defines the shape of the base.
Then, a custom-made inflatable nylon shell, made by Mr. South's company in Texas, is blown up. Polyurethane foam is sprayed on the interior and a rebar frame is put up. Then a specially mixed concrete called shotcrete is sprayed on in layers, tapering from about six inches thick at the base to about 2¾ inches thick at the top.
The exposed surface of the dome is the nylon shell, which can be covered with paint or other surfaces such as stucco or metal cladding.
Mr. Cushnie and his friend and business partner, Collin MacLeod, had travelled to Texas to learn about domes and have since started Great Lakes Dome Co. and erected seven of the concrete structures.
Environmental concerns are a big part of the attraction of monolithic domes.
Mr. MacLeod, a carpenter from Hamilton, says erecting a concrete dome produces little waste, compared with conventional house building.
Once built, the foam creates a tight seal, preventing air leaks and making the heating system energy efficient. The concrete also has great thermal mass, he adds. It absorbs heat and holds onto that heat very well.
Mr. Goodwin's dome in Lion's Head, which is bright and dry, even on a particularly dismal, rainy spring day, took about seven months to build, including a six-week break and delays as builders and local tradespeople took on other work.
In total, the project cost about $180,000. That includes $25,000 for the 100- by 180-foot lot, and about $10,000 for the septic system. The two solar hot-water units on the roof, which feed into the in-floor heating system, also are included in that figure.
The cost of building a dome home is comparable with the price of custom-built homes of a similar size, though maintenance and energy use are usually cheaper, dome builders say.
Mr. Goodwin chose his Lion's Head location because land in Southampton does not come cheaply. He also wanted to be near downtown, where he can walk to his morning coffee and shopping.
His new house is a five-minute walk from the main street in Lion's Head, and, though it's early days yet, he says he's happy, although his work is still tied to the art community in Southampton.
Mr. Cushnie and his wife, Rebecca, and their three children also live in a dome house. Their two-dome structure in Southampton comprises a main dome with a 40-foot diameter, and a smaller one that is 24 feet in diameter. Including a loft in the main dome, there is about 1,250 square feet of living space.
The main dome includes four bedrooms, two bathrooms, the kitchen and the living room. There's an office and another bathroom in the smaller dome.
The Cushnies, who moved in four years ago, are enthusiastic supporters of dome living and say they have no complaints.
"It just feels like a house that you move into, like any other house," says Mrs. Cushnie. "The couch fits fine against the wall."
If there is a drawback, it might be acoustics. While they're great for Mr. Goodwin's harmonica, it's easy to imagine the echoes building as the children play. But the interior walls in the Cushnie dome help to dampen that.
There isn't anything unexpected about living in a dome, Mr. Cushnie says, though he adds, "I never thought we could have tobogganed off it, but it's excellent for tobogganing. We go dome sliding all the time."
As for Great Lakes Dome Co., they've got their sights set on bigger prizes. After years of working for developers building massive subdivisions, they're ready to cut in on that business. "We are trying to break into that scene and become big developers," says Mr. Cushnie.
A year ago they were advertising plans to begin a dome home subdivision in Tobermory, Ont., a town at the tip of the Bruce Peninsula. But that project is on hiatus because of a land claims dispute. In the meantime, they've been surprised by the level of interest in monolithic domes.
"We expected to do more promotion and educating," says Mr. MacLeod, who is already planning his own dome home for a lot in Oliphant, Ont., a Lake Huron cottage community. "It's almost scary how many people are already educated and waiting."
And sure enough, the phone rings. It's someone who has sold his house in Scarborough and wants to get a dome of his own started in Southampton.

Full text:   The Jewish Vocational Service (JVS) held its annual fundraising luncheon this week in Toronto to give out some awards and highlight its charitable work. It featured a stellar lineup of legal liege Edward Greenspan as master of ceremonies and keynote speaker David Goodman , CEO of $60-billion money manager DundeeWealth Inc. and scion to father Ned Goodman's financial empire.
Advance talk was that Mr. Goodman, who by night sometimes does standup comedy in clubs, might favour the audience with a routine, but he gave a sober talk about barriers to financial literacy and work ethic. Instead, it was Mr. Greenspan, a friend of the Goodmans, who did the yuk-yuk thing.
Noting that early in his career Mr. Goodman joined the law firm Smith Lyons, Mr. Greenspan said: "At the end of the first day, he was named a partner." When he then joined Goodman and Co., "at 9 a.m. they started a search for a chief executive officer. At 9:05 David was selected. David's career has been nothing short of meteoric. This charity helps people overcome barriers to employment. I know of no one better qualified to speak to you today than David Goodman."
Mr. Goodman announced his company would contribute $50,000 over two years toward a financial literacy program.
EAU CANADA
Expect cottage country real estate agents to be toasting themselves with champagne this week. Nearly every wealthy, worldly American worth cold-calling was exposed to the charms of Ontario's cottage country this past Sunday - courtesy of a glowing article in the New York Times Magazine.
Entitled Eau Canada, the article by Stephen Metcalf was a clever study of "how the very rich live the simple life" in Muskoka and Georgian Bay.
"I am here to tell you, there is nothing quite like a twilight cocktail on a Muskoka dock," Mr. Metcalf wrote approvingly, even while noting the presence of "actors, hockey players and captains of Canadian business that make up the local float-plane-and-helipad set."
As for the more rustic Georgian Bay, "Once Canadians went to Muskoka to escape Toronto. Now they go to Georgian Bay to escape Muskoka."

Full text: 'Xbox 360 LIVE' to plaster Seattle jerseys in latest move toward advertising on uniforms
Ten months before their first game, the Seattle Sounders of Major League Soccer have signed only one player and still don't have a coach. But they have landed a major sponsor - Microsoft Corp. , which will emblazon the front of the team's uniforms.
While splashing the names of corporate sponsors on sports jerseys is nothing new in Europe and other soccer-heavy markets, it's still extremely rare in U.S. team sports.
Beyond soccer, the only other major U.S. sports where it happens are tennis, golf and auto racing. The others consider it declassé. Yet uniforms are arguably the choicest real estate for sports marketers.
Today, Microsoft and the Sounders plan to announce a deal that will place the words "Xbox 360 LIVE" on the front of the Sounders' uniforms when they open next March at Qwest Field. Under the terms of the deal, Microsoft will pay the Sounders roughly $4-million (U.S.) a season for five years, according to people familiar with the arrangement.
It's the latest coup for the team's owners, who include former Walt Disney chairman Joe Roth, Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, actor Drew Carey and Seattle businessman Adrian Hanauer.
The expansion Sounders have already received deposits for 16,000 season tickets.
But the sponsorship deal with Microsoft is perhaps the biggest milestone, since the company has done little within the sports marketing arena previously other than a minor pro volleyball sponsorship and a few small ventures in foreign countries.
"Getting in on the ground floor with a new franchise and a relatively new league is a great opportunity for us," says Robbie Bach, president of Microsoft's entertainment and devices division.
While it would be considered sacrilegious to scrawl a corporate logo across the New York Yankees pinstripes or a Detroit Red Wings sweater, soccer fans throughout the world long ago began to view a team's ability to sell the front of their uniforms as a sign of strength.
Manchester United, the Yankees of soccer, reportedly collects $26-million from insurer American International Group. While MLS at first resisted selling uniform sponsorships, it has seen a rush of deals valued at between $1-million and $5-million since opening the door in 2006.
First came Red Bull, the energy-drink maker, which bought the league's New York area franchise in 2006 and renamed them the Red Bulls. That same year juice company XanGo Juice put its name on the uniforms of Real Salt Lake. Last year, five more companies jumped in, led by Herbalife, which signed up with the Los Angeles Galaxy as superstar David Beckham agreed to join the team.
MLS, after year of struggling, received a much-needed boost last year with the arrival of Britain's Mr. Beckham, the game's best-known personality, if not its best player.
Other international stars, including Mexico's Cuauhtemoc Blanco of the Chicago Fire, have brought thousands of new fans to soccer-specific stadiums in Chicago, Los Angeles and Texas.
Several more stadiums will open in the coming years, and despite a slim presence on television, franchises are now valued at $25-million to $40-million, up from just $5-million to $10-million earlier in the decade.
MLS Commissioner Don Garber said the Microsoft deal is the latest sign that the league, which nearly went belly-up seven years ago, has gained an unprecedented level of traction.
Mr. Roth, one of Hollywood's most respected executives, has been making movies for 35 years but has always had his eye on owning a sports franchise.
A former soccer player in high school who also coached his son's teams for 15 years as an adult, Mr. Roth decided to pursue a soccer franchise in Seattle because the city's demographics and soccer history pointed to a success.
"We all felt the best place to start in Seattle was Microsoft," he says. "It's an international company but also a local company, which is what soccer should be."
The city's team in the former North American Soccer League, also named the Sounders, was one of the more successful franchises. Also, the state has one of the highest rates of youth soccer participation with 130,000 young players, plus an additional 60,000 players in adult leagues.
A 2006 exhibition between Real Madrid and D.C. United in 2006 sold out Qwest Field, and earlier this year some 56,000 fans watched Mexico play China.
When it starts play next year as the league's 15th franchise, Seattle will be the tenth MLS team to have a corporate name emblazoned on it.

Full text: OBJECTIVE
For the past year, we've followed the picks that elite money managers gave at the Ira W. Sohn Investment Research Conference. This is a conference held every year in New York when about 1,000 people pay as much as $3,000 (U.S.) to listen to big-name investors talk about their top picks. The speakers lay out their best long or short ideas and then listeners are free to call their brokers. These money managers run billions and billions of dollars, so let's see how the speakers from the 2007 conference did over the past year.
Later this week we'll start tracking the picks from the 2008 conference, which was held last week.
WHAT WORKED OVER THE PAST YEAR
For the sake of simplicity, we tracked the picks using local currencies. The long investors certainly had a tough year. The money to be had was in shorting the housing market. The champion was William Ackman of Pershing Square Capital, who shorted Ambac Financial Group Inc. and MBIA Inc. because he saw subprime problems just getting started last May. It's no wonder that Wendy's International Inc. bumped in price last week when Mr. Ackman mentioned the fast-food chain as his pick at this year's Ira Sohn conference.

Full text: Officials estimate that preserving old walls would add $5-million to $6-million to building price
Toronto Police say a project to tear down a west-end school and put up a new police station could now cost an extra $6-million, after the city's preservation board recommended that city council list the 94-year-old building as a heritage property.
The $25.5-million plans to demolish the former Carleton Public School on Davenport Road near Old Weston Road and build a new 11 Division police station were approved by council last December.
But this week, the preservation board voted to recommend that the Edwardian brick building be listed, which would require the police to take its heritage into account in their plans, possibly requiring them to incorporate the south and east façades in the new structure.
Police officials, who say the new station must meet high energy-efficiency standards as well as be able to withstand various natural disasters, estimate that preserving the old walls would cost them $5-million to $6-million extra, while preserving the entire building's outer structure could cost as much as $10-million.
"It's an interesting building, but is it so unique that something would be lost to the city?" asked Alok Mukherjee, chairman of the Toronto Police Services Board. "Early 20th-century Edwardian is not that unusual."
Mr. Mukherjee said the request to look into the property's heritage value originally came from the office of local city Councillor Cesar Palacio, who did not attend this week's preservation board meeting and did not return calls from The Globe and Mail.
Police say they desperately need a new home for 11 Division, whose 190-plus officers are now crammed into the oldest functioning police station in the city, built in the late 1950s. Officials warn that preserving parts of the building could set back their schedule to reopen it by 2011 up to 18 months. Councillor Adam Vaughan (Ward 20, Trinity-Spadina), who sits on the preservation board, said the city and the police should have anticipated the need to save the building and should be able to afford the extra cost of preserving the city's history.
"The police should know better," Mr. Vaughan said. "...You don't come in and say it's going to cost too much to save the building when you haven't even designed the new building."
The city's heritage staff had actually recommended that the building be immediately designated a heritage structure, a tougher move that would have allowed the city to "manage change" on the site and encourage the retention of its historic attributes.
But Councillor Kyle Rae (Ward 27, Toronto Centre-Rosedale), who also sits on the board, moved the less-drastic motion to list it as a heritage property, essentially directing police to start looking at what could be preserved in their plans.
He said the school board or the city should have had it designated long before the city agreed to buy it and hand it over to the police. It is still owned by the Toronto District School Board - which sent a lawyer and its real estate manager to this week's hearing - as the $8.7-million land deal has not gone through. The decision to list the building must still be approved by council.

OH, OH, CANADA!
A Voice from the Conservative Resistance
By William D. Gairdner
BPS Books, 195 pages, $16.95
A few years ago, I stood on the corner of College and Spadina, in Toronto, with writer Barry Callaghan. We'd been discussing a prior incarnation of the city in which the shadow of the Family Compact still asserted itself in a staid, Presbyterian class arrangement - the Irish, Jews and blacks who used to animate the local jazz clubs on the bottom and, at the top, a handful of families controlling the banks, retail and factories. Callaghan derided what he called the city's "Massey Culture" and wondered why its new polyethnic nature was not yet reflected on Bay Street.
"If you're a businessman," he said, "the way you tell your story is, you take over things, so why are the boards of directors of the banks still all run by the same people? Why aren't there Italians on those boards, why aren't there Portuguese?"
Today, many of Canada's new business paragons are Italian- and Portuguese-, but also South Asian-, Iranian- and Chinese-Canadians, though they do not yet control the boards. (In Toronto, old Canada persists in two places: in the boardrooms, and also in the numbers of the city's homeless, predominantly white.) Although the new financial order has no decent novelist as witness yet, it has had its documentarians. Peter Newman, of course, was one. Diane Francis, editor of the Financial Post before she became a National Post columnist, is another.
In Who Owns Canada Now , Francis has updated her 1986 assessment of Canadian business, Controlling Interest: Who Owns Canada? The new book offers an appropriately changed picture from the pinstriped, risk-averse world that Canada was, in which the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) did not yet exist, the dollar was at par without the punishing benefit of the Athabasca tar sands, and its major players were likely to convene at the Vancouver Club or Winston's, in Toronto, and keep the Jewish, Asian and other upstarts at the door.
The substance of the book lies in the fleeting portraits Francis provides of 75 business tycoons, operating from coast to coast (and sometimes offshore), who have excelled in various sectors of the economy: real estate, banking, agribusiness, mining, high technology, entertainment etc. The chosen are mostly men, of course (this is the truth she is plumbing here), and deferring to our present "off-the-island" sensibility, Francis lists 16 of the 35 families from the original book that no longer cut it: the Molsons, the Eatons, the Steinbergs, the Websters, Edward and Peter Bronfman, Conrad Black.
It is no mystery why Winston's long ago shut its doors. As tends to be true of societies where inherited position counts for too much, a lot of these former players were just too stupid to keep pace with the new entrepreneurs, mostly self-made, at their heels. "Handing down inheritances is like putting on the Olympic team the children of all the former gold medalists," Francis says, paraphrasing Warren Buffet. "It makes no sense."
Who Owns Canada Now? is a formulaic, albeit unpretentious book that will please the 75 in it and the hoi polloi who think there may be guidance in the shallow axioms Francis's subjects offer. These magnates profess to their scribbling acolyte, not about to endanger her own position, that it's not the money that matters; they love giving it away, built their fortunes by working hard, averting debt and knowing what their talent was and pursuing it.
None of these tycoons made their fortune by screwing their rivals, suppressing a few locals, hiring Russian thugs, making friends with a Domi or handing a few hundred thousand dollars in a paper bag to someone in government. No, here the order for several malls or one in Israel is casually made because a mayor, blithely unaware of legal tenders, says, "I want you to do a shopping centre," pats his old chum on the back and away we go. Although one B.C. mining magnate admits to having taken out bank loans to buy his own stock, no one comes close to saying, "I made my fortune because I build crap housing that looks great on first inspection," "I make sure to keep plenty of councillors on my party list," or, "I hate my children, which is why I give all my money away."
A different book, you say? Well, a more enquiring one, certainly. As it is, Francis's book is a bestseller, so she need not worry if such harmless chronicling is all she is
capable of, though I suspect an account of what she really knows about Canadian business would be fascinating. Instead, she offers a de rigueur homily to the multicultural nature of our society, suggests that further economic integration with the United States is the sine qua non for our future prosperity, and blames a tax regime that is onerous on corporations.
If our taxes are high, it is because we offer safety nets and social programs that many other countries envy, or used to envy, and it is a lament for this version of Canadian society that arch-nationalist Mel Hurtig offers in The Truth About Canada . According to Hurtig, Canada has become a haven of easily made corporate profits, where the gap between the rich making ever more money at an obscenely climbing rate while the poor become even more so, continues to widen as our schools and health systems deteriorate and extraordinary numbers of our children live in poverty.
It is possible for the patient reader to glean from this unstylish and exasperating text some of this information, as well as more bad news about the media, energy and other sectors of Canadian life in which Hurtig sees no hope. This is not so much a book as a spewing of figures from Statistics Canada, the UN and various newspaper and magazine reports.
I offer up, at random, one of about 1,500 paragraphs, one after another, identical in style:
"Where to begin? Let's start with GDP per capita. In the 17 years before the FTA [Free Trade Agreement], 1972 to 1988, GDP per capita increased by $9,365. During the first 17 years of the FTA, 1989 to 2005, the per-capita increase fell only to $8,354. In the 17 years before the FTA, Canada's overall GDP increased at an annual rate of over 3.66 per cent. During the first 17 years of the FTA, it increased at an annual rate of only 2.63 per cent. Quite a difference!"
Hurtig's indigestible screed is laced with infantile references to the National Post, the C. D. Howe Institute and other right-wing organizations as "Neanderthals," or people peddling "baloney" and "B.S.," and promises that if the reader is not already outraged, then to "wait until the last paragraphs in this chapter ..." This exhortation is made again and again, but oh, my, that is hard to do. Hurtig offers no real analysis, and no real effort at readability - no characters, for instance, who might have animated his tedious rant. What information is here would have been infinitely more interesting, and more easily retained, in the graphs and tables in which most of it, I suspect, originated. The Truth About Canada is a botched opportunity to convey facts that, in some more communicative form, might have undermined Diane Francis's fawning world of platitudinous multi-millionaires.
William D. Gairdner, the libertarian author of Oh, Oh Canada! , is, presumably, one of Hurtig's "Neanderthals." Gairdner argues for the (traditional) family, against homosexuality, abortion and atheism and - as did Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, after he repatriated the forlorn English navy squad Iran had seized from the Straits of Hormuz - Gairdner pities a nation that sends women such as Nichola Goddard to fight its wars. Of this country, "filled with strong and vital men," he asks: "Why has every Canadian man worth his name felt an inner twinge of conscience over her death?" Oh, please!
Gairdner's's tone is glib and trite, and if his essays had any real intellectual contribution to make (the author being fond of pat lessons in philosophy), they would not be just irritating. They are hard to take seriously except that, I suppose, brethren such as Charles McVety, president of the Canada Family Action Coalition, are having an impact on our current government.
This interesting country, with its singular history, achievements and challenges, will find more astute witnesses.
Noah Richler's This is My Country, What's Yours? A Literary Atlas of Canada won the 2007 B.C. Award for Canadian non-fiction. He is currently at work on a book about the effects of globalization on rural communities.

Pemberton Group wants to tap into the demand for smaller accommodations in the Erin Mills community of Mississauga. Earlier this month, it launched an 18-storey building called Nouvelle in the largely low-rise neighbourhood.
The fourth and last tower in the master-planned community called Papillon Place, Nouvelle will be linked to the third tower, which is now under construction. The first two buildings are already occupied.
Located off Eglinton Avenue, east of Winston Churchill Boulevard, the site is across the street from several retail outlets and restaurants, as well as the Erin Mills Town Centre. In the other direction are local parks and, in the distance, Lake Ontario. Other nearby amenities include schools, the Credit Valley Hospital and highways 403 and 407.
Residents of the 196-unit Nouvelle will have services of a 24-hour concierge, as well as recreational amenities that are located in a new two-storey building at the centre of the complex. The 13,000-square-foot centre includes a fully equipped gym, aerobics room, indoor pool, hot tub and a virtual golf theatre. The new tower, as with the other, will have underground access to the facility.
Also available are a boardroom, two party rooms with kitchens and bars, and a large lounge with several billiard tables, card tables and multiple walkouts to a rooftop terrace and barbecue area.
As in the previous phase, there will be one- and two-bedroom layouts with combined living and dining rooms, open kitchens with breakfast bars and, in some cases, media rooms. Each unit will have its own balcony off the principal room.
Larger suites will feature traditional eat-in kitchens and master bedrooms with walk-in closets and ensuite bathrooms.
Reintroduced in this phase is an 800-square foot model with two bedrooms and two bathrooms. It was first offered in the first phase.
Flooring options include laminate, 40-ounce carpeting and imported porcelain or ceramic tile. Kitchens will include granite countertops and stainless-steel appliances. Stacked laundry machines are also part of the package.
Buyers will get a parking space and locker. The monthly maintenance fee will be 42 cents a square foot, and hydro will be individually metered.
Move-ins are expected to start in November, 2010.

Before the flood, make sure your home is properly insured

Abstract: Flood insurance is relatively inexpensive for people who don't live in high-risk areas. Average premiums run about $600 a year, though homeowners in high-risk areas can pay as much as $5,400 a year. Renters in low-risk areas can protect their belongings for about $200 a year, or $2,200 for high-risk zones. [Gerry] and I have decided it's worth our peace of mind to buy flood insurance - at an additional cost of $348 a year.

Full text: Many homeowners turn their thoughts to spring cleaning this time of year. But my thoughts are usually drawn toward making sure the contents of our home remain safe and protected. That's because our homeowners insurance policy is up for renewal every June.
The renewal process is usually pretty painless: Check to see whether we need to update our policy to reflect any upgrades or new purchases. If no changes are needed, I then check the rate quote by doing some comparison shopping on the Web. (www.kanetix.ca and www.insurancehotline.com are two such sites.) Once satisfied that our current insurer is still offering the best deal, I typically pay our annual premium in full online and print out my payment confirmation. Generally, it takes no more than 20 minutes.
But this year, my policy renewal required a bit more attention to satisfy me that our home and its contents are being properly protected. For the past five years, my husband, Gerry, and I have been gradually making improvements to our home that have added to its value - and our enjoyment - and I wanted to make sure that our coverage has increased sufficiently to protect us in the event of a disaster.
Plus, a wild card was thrown into the mix: The U.S. government recently updated the flood-zone maps for our area for the first time in nearly 20 years. Though our home is still not designated as being in a flood zone, we're now within 16 kilometres of one.
Gerry and I haven't added any new rooms or increased our home's square footage, but we have made material improvements in our kitchen and family room that would increase the cost of rebuilding.
This year, we're planning to upgrade our siding and windows with top-quality energy-efficient replacements. We'll need to update our home's replacement-cost coverage limit to reflect the improvements.
One way to estimate a home's replacement cost is to get an estimate from a local contractor; a formal estimate of your home's replacement cost will cost you between $100 and $250 (U.S.).
Steve, a family friend who's also a building contractor, gave us a free estimate. He suggested we raise the replacement-cost coverage of our home (the building itself, not its contents) to $250,000 from $189,000. The increase in coverage boosted our premium to $800 from $750.
Gerry and I insure our home for replacement cost, which means our policy pays to repair or replace damage to our home with materials of similar quality. What our current policy doesn't cover is "demand surge," or post-catastrophe inflation. Demand surge often occurs after large disasters, such as wind damage or flood, strike a wide area. When many homeowners and businesses are in need of rebuilding after a disaster, material and labour costs can skyrocket.
Our insurer does offer "extended replacement cost" coverage, which will cover an additional 20 per cent of the cost of rebuilding the home over our policy limits. The cost: an additional $50. (That raises our annual premium to a total of $850.) After checking over our limits on liability insurance and replacement costs for the contents of our home, I was satisfied we were adequately insured - except in the event of a flood.
Flood insurance is relatively inexpensive for people who don't live in high-risk areas. Average premiums run about $600 a year, though homeowners in high-risk areas can pay as much as $5,400 a year. Renters in low-risk areas can protect their belongings for about $200 a year, or $2,200 for high-risk zones. Gerry and I have decided it's worth our peace of mind to buy flood insurance - at an additional cost of $348 a year. We already had minor water damage in our home after a severe storm the year we bought the home. With the threat of flood increasing, it's foolish to keep pressing our luck.

Abstract: Some employers claim meaningful work as being in their gift [of employment]. Maybe you've heard your chief executive talk of 'commitment,' 'discretionary effort,' 'buy-in' and the 'fulfilment of potential' - it makes 'meaning' seem only a short jump away. But even the best-led and most well-intentioned employers cannot create meaning for people. They can treat people well, but that's no guarantee of meaning.

CARBON CAPTURE
Parts of the Australian seabed will be offered for tender for carbon capture and storage ventures as early as December, The Australian newspaper reports. Resources Minister Martin Ferguson said he would complete the world's first legislative framework for carbon sequestration within months, clearing the way for greenhouse gases collected from coal-fired power stations to be injected through the seabed and captured in geological formations. The minister said calling for tenders this year would encourage investment and commercialization of the technology, which he described as a safe way to allow continued carbon-based power generation.
CHARISMATIC BOSS? BEWARE
"The idea of charisma may be stronger than its actual effects," Carlin Flora writes in Psychology Today. "Rakesh Khurana, associate professor of organizational behaviour at Harvard Business School, finds that when American companies look for new leaders, they seek charisma above all other qualities - but the bottom-line results of this hiring practice are often disappointing, even disastrous. Under uncertain market conditions, charismatic CEOs are good for one thing: They temporarily boost their company's stock prices. But the improvement is usually short-lived. That's because charisma may have more to do with a person's image than with his or her innate abilities."
MARRIAGE FRESHMAN
After six months of marriage, "I seem to be in danger of coming around to the idea that perhaps not all women are such bad chaps," Martin Deeson writes in the British edition of GQ magazine. Some of his hard-won knowledge about living with women:
* Get them their own television.
* Say yes to everything.
* When you say no, make sure your wife is in the other room.
* Get a hobby. It's cheaper than a mistress.
* Get married on the first of the month so it's easy to remember your anniversary.
SQUATTER SCAMS
Across the United States, squatting is on the rise as house foreclosures surge, eviction notices mount and homes sit unsold for months, Reuters reports. In some regions, squatting is taking on new twists that include real-estate scams in which thieves "rent out" abandoned homes they don't own. Others involve "professional squatters" who move from one abandoned home to another posing as tenants and seeking cash from banks as a condition to leave the premises - known by real-estate brokers as "cash for key."
GHOST-BIKE MEMORIALS
In Chicago, a bicycle spray-painted white has been chained to a streetlight pole where a bicyclist was struck and killed by a car last month. It joins at least eight other such monuments in the city, the Chicago Tribune reports. Some notes about "ghost bikes" and their growing appearances:
* The concept originated in St. Louis in 2002, when Patrick Van Der Tuin, an employee at a bike shop, witnessed a car swerve into a bike lane and severely injure a young woman. In response, he took a junk bike, smashed it with a sledgehammer, spray-painted it white and installed it at the scene of the crash. "I wanted it to be as shocking as possible," he said.
* Today, ghost bikes are found in major cities throughout North America, according to ghostbike.org. They have also appeared elsewhere in the world.
* "The hope is that by placing visual reminders, it will cause people to stop and think, 'Oh, a cyclist got hit here,' " Morgan Ress, a member of the local advocacy group Bike Pittsburgh, told the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review last year.
WORLD O' TASTE BUDS
Recent notes:
* "Why is it that after I eat a salad, I want something sweet - in particular, chocolate?" asks a reader of Women's Health magazine. Columnist Lisa Drayer replies that this craving could be habit, or it "could be a phenomenon we in the biz call 'taste-specific satiety.' You experience the highest flavour sensation of a certain food in the first few bites; after that, you taste it less intensely, and that can trigger cravings for a drastically new flavour."
* The appearance of a drink can affect how happy we are with it: Our brains make a pleasant association between the colours of ripening fruit and increased sugar content, Roger Highfield writes in The Daily Telegraph. "Such colours, particularly bright reds, are especially powerful visual cues," says British psychologist Charles Spence. "When incorporated into a drink, they can dramatically change the perceived flavour, as well as increasing the perceived sweetness by as much as 12 per cent." French researchers tested this by using an odourless dye to colour white wine red. The wine tasters who tried the result used typical red-wine descriptors, suggesting that its colour played a significant role in how they thought of it.
THOUGHT DU JOUR
"Some employers claim meaningful work as being in their gift [of employment]. Maybe you've heard your chief executive talk of 'commitment,' 'discretionary effort,' 'buy-in' and the 'fulfilment of potential' - it makes 'meaning' seem only a short jump away. But even the best-led and most well-intentioned employers cannot create meaning for people. They can treat people well, but that's no guarantee of meaning. Meaning is something workers find or don't find on their own."

Full text: McCain, Clinton are property millionaires; Obama also profited
Like millions of Americans, the three presidential candidates rode the real estate wave. But for them there's been no hard landing, and well-timed home purchases in prime neighbourhoods have left two of them - senators John McCain and Hillary Clinton - with millions in real estate gains.
The McCain family owns at least seven properties, including a spread in rural Arizona. In the past four years, the Republican's wealthy wife, Cindy, has spent roughly $11-million (U.S.) on real estate, buying three condos in Phoenix and two in California, across the bay from San Diego.
Ms. Clinton and former president Bill Clinton likely own the most expensive property among the three candidates: a stately home in the Observatory Circle neighbourhood of Washington that cost $2.85-million in 2001 and now is worth about $5-million. (Value estimates are based on an averaging of property-valuation websites, local broker assessments and real estate listings and records; the candidates' campaigns were contacted about the findings.)
But the Clintons also once owned the most modest property, their first home together: a tiny house in Fayetteville, Ark., that cost $20,500 in 1975. It has since been converted into a Clinton museum.
Meanwhile, Senator Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle, paid $1.65-million for their Chicago house in 2005 - the rough market peak - and have seen its value stagnate, if not decline slightly. The purchase came after the success of Mr. Obama's best-selling memoir, Dreams From My Father . That same year, the couple sold their Chicago condo for $415,000 - $137,500 more than they paid for it in 1993.
But the Obama campaign has faced questions about whether the house purchase was subsidized by Chicago developer Antoin "Tony" Rezko.
Mr. Obama bought the house for 15 per cent less than its $1.95-million asking price - equal to the price the sellers had paid for it in 2000, when neighbourhood values were lower. On the same day as his purchase, Mr. Rezko paid the full $625,000 asking price for an adjacent lot being sold by the same owners - 51 per cent more than the sellers had paid for the vacant land in 2000.
Some have asked whether the price paid by Mr. Rezko for the vacant land made the owners willing to sell Mr. Obama the house for less than its fair market value. The sellers declined to speak to a reporter and Mr. Rezko's lawyer didn't return a call.
Mr. Obama has categorically denied he received any discount from the fair market value. The Obama campaign says he was the home's highest bidder and that the sellers required the purchases to close on the same day. Real estate records indicate the house purchase price was roughly consistent with sales of similar-sized homes in the area around that time. (Mr. Obama later also purchased a narrow strip of the vacant land from Mr. Rezko, for roughly $100,000.)
The McCain homes all are owned by Ms. McCain, heir to a beer-distributor fortune, or by trusts for her benefit. The McCains bought luxury properties in the 1980s and 1990s and have seen dramatic gains from the real estate boom. In 2006, the family sold their long-time Phoenix house for $3.2-million, nearly 29 times what it cost 20 years earlier, when Ms. McCain bought it from her father.
Their Arizona getaway is along a creek - rare in the desert - and is worth $4-million, nearly four times what it cost to assemble the three parcels in the 1990s.
"They've made very wise real estate investments," says Gregory Hague of Hague Partners, an Arizona real estate firm that wasn't involved in the McCain purchases. With their multiple residences and seven children (three from Mr. McCain's first marriage), Ms. McCain paid $273,000 for household help in 2007, according to their recently released tax returns.
The Clintons also have created wealth through property. Near the end of Mr. Clinton's presidency, they bought two expensive homes, the Washington house and one in Chappaqua, N.Y., a wealthy suburb north of New York. That has resulted in big paper gains, though the values have fallen recently.
In the 1970s and early 1980s, the couple owned a series of relatively modest houses in that state but didn't own a home at all during Mr. Clinton's eight years as president.

BARACK OBAMA
HOUSE IN CHICAGO
WHAT: Georgian-revival home of 6,500 square feet with six bedrooms and 5½ bathrooms on a 80-by-150-foot lot. Includes a music room, master bedroom suite with fireplace, open kitchen with granite countertops, central air-conditioning, wine cellar and four-car garage.
PURCHASE PRICE/DATES: $1.65-million for the house in June, 2005, plus $104,166 for an adjacent strip of land in January, 2006.
ANNUAL PROPERTY TAXES: $22,162.
TOUR: Located near the University of Chicago, the Kenwood neighbourhood has many stately old houses. The Obamas bought after his Senate election, and after his memoir became a hit. The 84-year-old house was restored in 1999 by prior owners, who created a third-floor family room, finished the basement and overhauled mechanical systems.
Previously, the Obamas lived in a four-bedroom, 2,200-square-foot condo in Chicago's South Shore. The couple bought the apartment while Mr. Obama was a civil-rights lawyer and University of Chicago lecturer and Ms. Obama was executive director of a non-profit organization. After the births of their two daughters in 1999 and 2001, the family wanted more space.
DUE DILIGENCE: The Obamas bought at roughly the market peak. Sales have since slowed, although area property values haven't dropped steeply. Current estimated value is $1.8-million.
*****
JOHN MCCAIN
CAMBELBACK CONDO SUITES, PHOENIX
WHAT: The McCains' main residence, this 6,500-square-foot, glass-walled condo with three terraces is in a recently built high-rise called 2211 Camelback. They also have a 2,000-square-foot unit on a lower floor.
AMENITIES: The 90-unit development has a rooftop pool and a concierge. There's also valet parking and a gym.
PURCHASE PRICE/DATES: High-floor apartment, $4.67-million in October, 2006; lower unit, $830,000 in August, 2007.
ANNUAL PROPERTY TAXES: $15,542 for both units.
TOUR: Cindy McCain set what is believed by local brokers to be a record condo price for the area when she agreed in 2004 to buy two adjacent high-floor apartments, which she combined.
DUE DILIGENCE: Though the upper-floor unit appreciated after the 2004 purchase agreement, its value has since fallen to about the purchase price, brokers say. The lower-floor unit's value is about $715,000, down 14 per cent.
Biltmore Lofts condo, Phoenix
What: A 1,904-squre-foot, three-bedroom apartment in a new, 12-unit luxury complex.
Purchase price/date: $700,000 in June 2007.
Annual property taxes: $4,500.
Due diligence: Worth about $615,000, down 12 per cent from the purchase price.
CONDO IN ARLINGTON, VA.
What: Mr. McCain's home during the workweek, a three-bedroom, 2½ -bath condo of 2,100 square feet in the Crystal Gateway complex near Reagan National Airport.
Purchase price/date: $375,000 in February, 1993
Annual property taxes: About $7,200.
Tour: The 17th-floor condo in this 1981 building is in an area with few residential amenities. But it's just a few kilometres from his campaign headquarters in Crystal City, Va.
Due diligence: Brokers say the unit is worth about $750,000.
GETAWAY IN SEDONA, ARIZ.
What: A 6.5-acre property with a main house of 2,500 square feet, a 900-square-foot guesthouse and a caretaker's house. Its rare riverfront location on Oak Creek affords vegetation including sycamore and cottonwood trees, a stark contrast to the area's typical high-desert landscape.
Purchase price/date: Total of $1.1-million in several purchases in the 1990s.
Annual property taxes: $6,451.
Tour: Located about 15 minutes outside Sedona in Cornville, this isolated property is a favoured destination when Mr. McCain isn't in Washington.
Due diligence: Sedona's climate, recreational options and new-age vibe sent property prices tripling during the boom. But prices have dropped 20 per cent or more in the past 18 months, brokers say, which means the McCain property, worth perhaps $5-million at the peak, might now fetch $4-million.
CONDO IN CORONADO, CALIF.
What: A three-bedroom, eighth-floor, ocean-view condo of 1,750 square feet, plus a 2,250-square-foot, three-bedroom bay-view apartment six floors below.
Amenities: Coronado Shores is next to Hotel Del Coronado. The 10-building complex has four pools, eight tennis courts and sits on the beach.
Purchase price/dates: Eighth-floor unit, $2.6-million in September, 2004; second-floor unit, $2.1-million in February, 2008.
Annual property taxes: About $41,000 for both units.
Tour: Ms. McCain bought the first apartment as a vacation home. The newly purchased apartment has four bedrooms and was listed at $2.875-million, but Ms. McCain paid $2.1-million.
Due diligence: Prices haven't tumbled in Coronado Shores, a desirable spot across the bay from San Diego. But Ms. McCain paid about $1,500 a square foot for her first apartment, a record for that type of unit, and the market still has not quite caught up.
*****
HILLARY CLINTON
HOUSE IN CHAPPAQUA, N.Y
What: The couple's main residence, a five-bedroom, white Dutch colonial revival house dating to 1889 on a little over one acre. Vetted by the U.S. Secret Service, the home is at the end of a cul-de-sac in this prosperous northern suburb of New York City, in Westchester County.
Purchase price/date: $1.7-million (U.S.) in December, 1999.
Annual property taxes: About $47,000.
Tour: Ms. Clinton needed to establish a home in New York to run for the Senate. The couple paid just over the $1.695-million asking price, making a $350,000 down payment and using a bank loan of $1.35-million secured by Terry McAuliffe, former head of the Democratic National Committee and current chairman of Ms. Clinton's campaign. As the last president to receive lifetime Secret Service protection, Mr. Clinton created live-in quarters for his security detail. The couple also added an octagonal breakfast-room extension. While on the campaign trail it hasn't been unusual for Ms. Clinton to fly to Chappaqua to spend the night in her own bed, campaign reporters say.
Due diligence: The home's current value is about $2.6-million, say brokers and property-valuation sites, some 50 per cent more than the Clintons paid for it.
CLINTON PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY PENTHOUSE
What: A 2,000-square-foot, modernist-style apartment atop the William J. Clinton Presidential Center in Little Rock, Ark. The apartment is an amenity for the Clintons in the 152,000-square-foot building, which opened in October, 2004.
Tour: A private apartment is a common feature of presidential libraries, but this glass box drew attention because of its unusual design. Its style is also in stark contrast to the Clintons' other homes.
HOUSE IN WASHINGTON, D.C.
What: A six-bedroom, single-family home of 5,150 square feet built in 1951. Trees hide the property from the street.
Purchase price/date: $2.85-million in 2001.
Annual property taxes: $43,612.
Tour: The large home is on a quiet, one-block street off Observatory Circle, a residential neighbourhood in northwest Washington near the vice-president's house.
Due diligence: . Brokers and property-valuation sites say this house is worth about $5-million, roughly equal to its current assessed value. In 2006, its assessed value more than doubled, but for 2009, the city is proposing to trim the assessment by 1 per cent.

Full text: This Beautiful City
Written and directed
by Ed Gass-Donnelly
Starring Kristin Booth,
Caroline Cave, Stuart Hughes, Noam Jenkins and Aaron Poole
Classification: 18A
**
This feature debut from playwright Ed Gass-Donnelly is a scathing though not unfeeling depiction of West Queen West, the slowly gentrifying Toronto neighbourhood that real-estate agents would generously describe as an "artist community."
Yuppies Harry and Carol live here in an antiseptic, modern condo. As the film opens, they're hosting a dinner party. Harry makes a few funny remarks at his wife's expense. Later, she sneaks out on their balcony and feels strangely, momentarily exalted. Succumbing to a high, religious mood, Carol steps off the ledge and plummets 60 feet, ruining both the evening and her Holt Renfrew ensemble.
She is discovered and saved by an off-duty detective, Peter. The policeman didn't just happen by; he is searching the area for his hooker-drug-addict daughter. Peter eventually becomes involved with Carol. Harry, meanwhile, befriends a local prostitute, introducing her to restaurants and imported wines in an
attempt to save her from
herself.
Both are obviously risky adventures. And so the unhappy inhabitants of West Queen West thrash about like dangerously severed power wires, causing misfortune whenever they snake
together.
This Beautiful City is the work of an immature but not untalented director. Too many scenes are cranked up to 11. A junkie couple, Pretty (Kristin Booth) and her psychotic boyfriend, Johnny (Aaron Poole), are either sky high or strung out. There isn't a light moment in the film. Fateful coincidences abound. Nearly everyone in the ensemble winds up dead.
And yet the film contains one very good performance and one brilliant scene. Caroline Cave ( The L Word ) brings a startled anger to the role of Carol. She is the only character here that Gass-Donnelly hasn't made his mind up about. Carol's husband (Noam Jenkins) is a jerk. Peter (Stuart Hughes), the cop who saved her, is a burnout - empathetic, but in the end, useless.
Carol, however, is a mystery, and Cave wisely plays the part tentatively, as if she's working through a maze. At one point, Carol takes Peter to the roof of his apartment building and demands that he step onto the ledge. She wants him to feel alive, for his next step to mean something. "I used to love this city," she says, baffled. "Now it's just dinner parties and avoiding questions about children."
Later, they're in bed. Peter, for once, is bold, asking Carol to stand atop him as if she's on a ledge. She drops her bed-sheet robe, begins crying. But then a car horn from the street - the beautiful, dangerous city - startles her, and she steps back from commitment.
The scene works, where so much of This Beautiful City fails, because for once the filmmaker allows the viewer to participate in creating the scene. For once, no one is shouting. The meaning isn't clear. Like Carol, we have to put together what's happening. There is drama here. Alas, too much of the rest of the film is bombast and street noise.

Full text: Developer is forging a new business model while transforming ski hills into North American-style resorts
When Graham Kwan first laid eyes on the Sun Mountain Yabuli ski resort in northeast China, his impression was that it was "an absolute pig."
The mountain's sole hotel was located just far enough from the base that it couldn't be reached on skis, and its floor was speckled with dead bugs. Things weren't much better on the slopes, where snow conditions were patchy and the grooming machine was held together with duct tape.
But what the property did have was turnaround potential, exactly what Mr. Kwan, a former executive at Vancouver-based ski resort developer Intrawest Corp., was looking for.
His new venture, Melco China Resorts , bought Yabuli, along with four other fixer-upper ski hills in northeast China.
The firm, which will tap the capital markets with a listing on the TSX Venture Exchange next week, is now transforming the properties into North American-style ski resorts using a model similar to Intrawest's Whistler-Blackcomb in British Columbia and Mont Tremblant in Quebec.
It's a bet on the appetite of China's growing middle and upper classes, and a task Mr. Kwan acknowledges won't be easy.
"Most of the resorts are terrible. They have terrible old lifts, not very good snow making, safety is an issue, there's no accommodation and the food is marginal. That's pretty typical," he said.
In addition to winning over Chinese skiers, the handful of developers trying to "Westernize" the industry there face hurdles including government restrictions and a shortage of natural snow, said Tom Tillotson, an American who heads travel company China Ski Tours LLC.
"This model has yet to be tried in China. It has two main structural challenges; namely, providing top-notch skiing, and the Chinese government's concerns about real estate development, including sales to foreigners," Mr. Tillotson said.
Despite these challenges, Melco China sees an opportunity in the growing disposable income of many Chinese and their huge appetite for new experiences, said Lawrence Ho, co-chairman and chief executive of Hong Kong-based conglomerate Melco International Development Ltd., which owns a 45-per-cent stake in Melco China.
"There are plenty of beautiful places in China for scenic tours and golf, but for winter activities, there is not that much for the Chinese to do," said Mr. Ho, who grew up in Canada and is the son of Macau gambling tycoon Stanley Ho.
"Our strategy is to keep people there as long as possible, whether it's in a casino or on the ski slopes," Mr. Ho said in an interview from Hong Kong.
Last year, local travel in China soared to 1.6 billion vacation trips, a 123-per-cent increase from the year before, according to the Pacific Asia Travel Association (PATA). However, most of that travel involved visits to friends and relatives, and, as far as locals are concerned, skiing isn't even on the map in China, said Oliver Martin, associate director of PATA's The Strategic Intelligence Centre, based in Bangkok.
Melco China's goal is to win a piece of the domestic travel pie by creating decent places for the Chinese to ski relatively close to home.
It expects its bread and butter to be real estate development around the mountain bases, a model employed with great success by Mr. Kwan's former employer and a business Melco China believes could end up supplying the bulk of its revenues.
With the exception of Star Mountain, a learn-to-ski facility near Beijing, each of the company's four other ski hills will include residential development. This will range from hotel condos at Adventure Mountain Changchun, which is geared to younger visitors, to luxury homes at the members-only Lotus Mountain Club.
Under Melco China's current model, it can build 6,300 residential units across its business, but that could rise as high as 7,500 units, Mr. Kwan said.
At Yabuli, which is the most developed of its properties, Melco China is in the process of launching presales of its first 50 to 100 vacation homes. A typical unit will be a 3,000-square-foot ski-in home that will sell for around $750,000.
By year's end, Yabuli will also have numerous hotels, shops and restaurants, a spa and a conference centre.
Melco China expects the resorts to be popular year-round destinations for local business people looking to ski in winter and escape city heat and smog in summer, said Ermanno Pascutto, a lawyer and board member who helped put the company together and a former executive director of both the Ontario and Hong Kong securities commissions.
Mr. Pascutto said it's uncertain whether foreigners, himself included, will be allowed to buy homes at Melco China's resorts.
However, he says the company's problem probably won't be moving the units, which he expects will sell out very quickly. Instead, the challenge will be filling them with people who want to spend time at the resorts instead of those who want to buy numerous properties as investments, he said.

Full text: Office vacancy rate rebounds smartly from dire predictions at year-end as various firms play musical chairs
When Meyers Norris Penny LLP set out to accommodate an expected spurt in staffing levels, it did what a few local companies have opted to do this spring in Winnipeg - play musical chairs in the city's downtown office market.
The chartered accounting firm has agreed to sublet nearly 40,000 square feet in the 33-storey CanWest Global Place tower, taking up some of the space that had been vacated by Agricore United last year when it merged with Saskatchewan Wheat Pool to become Viterra Inc., a global agri-business.
"We need the additional space because of the rapid expansion of people in our firm," said Meyers Norris partner Dan Trotter, adding that the company expects to increase to about 200 people from about 160 over the next year and a half. The new office will also bring the company closer to many of its clients, he added.
The move, planned for this October, is one of several by local companies that have helped create a remarkable turnaround in the fortunes of Winnipeg's downtown office market this spring.
Just five months ago, industry observers had a bleak outlook: A surplus of sublease space had threatened to slow the city's traditionally stable market. By the first quarter, however, the picture had changed considerably. Now, analysts are predicting a more balanced market for the remainder of the year.
CB Richard Ellis had pegged the vacancy rate for class A property at 9 per cent at the end of 2007 but that had recovered to 6.4 per cent in March; class B space improved to 5.6 per cent from 8.9 per cent at the end of the year.
Cushman & Wakefield LePage, meanwhile, reported the class A market vacancy rate was 7.7 per cent at the end of the first quarter, down from 9 per cent at the end of 2007. The change was more muted for the class B market, falling to 7.3 per cent from 8 per cent at the end of the year.
Avison Young Commercial Real Estate (Manitoba) Inc. reported a much more modest change, but an improvement nonetheless: It had recorded a year-end vacancy rate of 7.6 per cent for class A and B properties, and that fell to 6.9 per cent at the end of the first quarter.
(Real estate companies track the numbers in their own ways, resulting in discrepancies in how they report the vacancy rates.)
Paul Kuzina, an office leasing specialist with CB Richard Ellis, said its figures represent the lowest downtown vacancy rate for Winnipeg in the past five years, helped by the absorption of about 225,000 square feet in the first quarter, thanks to "above-average leasing activity."
He attributed the more bullish demand to a strong Manitoba economy. "What we've seen over the years is that the public sector is playing a large part in the Winnipeg economy, and provincial and federal government departments have been expanding. There's an increased need for more space," Mr. Kuzina said.
As well, he said, companies headquartered in Winnipeg, such as Great-West Life Assurance Co., have experienced growth and, as a result, have leased larger blocks of space downtown.
Some of the transactions in early 2008 have included 4,000 square feet of space in the Commodity Exchange Tower going to a Calgary firm, and 68,000 square feet of space in cityplace, an office and retail development, being filled by the federal government, Manitoba Public Insurance and the City of Winnipeg. And, in a separate deal, the federal government leased 25,000 square feet of space in the downtown Grain Exchange Building.
Mr. Kuzina predicted the above-average absorption in the first quarter would ease in the following months and vacancy rates would remain around the March levels for a good portion of the year.
Last December, Avison Young had predicted a tenant's market would occur in 2008 with large chunks of lease and sublet space coming on to the market, including 77,000 square feet to be vacated by Manitoba Hydro when it moves into its new downtown tower and 73,000 square feet formerly occupied by Agricore United in CanWest Global Place. But much of this space has since been absorbed.
"There has been an upswing, particularly in the class A numbers," said Catherine Stoyko, marketing and research co-ordinator for Avison Young and author of its market summary. She expressed surprise by the turnaround of the downtown office market, but couldn't say if this was a long-term trend.
Cushman & Wakefield reported that the "big story" in the class B market was the leasing by Great-West Life of almost all of the soon-to-be vacated space of Centra Gas, a subsidiary of Manitoba Hydro.
"We remain cautiously optimistic that the market will continue to keep vacancy rates at or near present levels for the balance of the year," a Cushman report states. "Going forward, demand will depend largely upon growth in public sector office requirements and the financial services sector."

Full text: A Frank Gehry-designed arena complex in Brooklyn is a target in New Yorkers's favourite blood sport - real estate
By now, surely, Frank Gehry is inured to the revulsion of others. After wrestling with the Spanish over his whimsical Guggenheim Bilbao museum, with Angelenos over his blindingly reflective Walt Disney Concert Hall, with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology over leaks in a $300-million complex he designed there, and with his own neighbours over his chain-link-fence-adorned house in Santa Monica, the 79-year-old Canadian-born architect is now one of the primary targets of community activists over the gargantuan Atlantic Yards development in downtown Brooklyn, of which he is the chief architect.
Conceived more than four years ago when developer Bruce Ratner purchased the New Jersey Nets and announced his intention to move them to Brooklyn, Atlantic Yards was envisioned as an instant neighbourhood: a 16-building, nine-hectare complex that would throw down an 18,000-seat basketball arena, thousands of luxury condos, low-income housing, and eight office towers.
The only problem was, there was already a neighbourhood there. And though Flatbush and Prospect Heights had seen better days - more than a thousand manufacturing jobs left in the mid-1990s - and local fans were psyched about the return of professional sports to the borough, others weren't keen on being evicted or having the low-slung character of their area altered in a blinding flash of outside money. Others complained that the development would bring "instant gentrification."
The tallest office tower, dubbed Miss Brooklyn, was a 185-metre edifice of undulating glass better suited to the canyons of Manhattan.
Still, Gehry's designs were well received by architecture critics who were seduced by his vision of an arena, adorned with massive sails, that would hide within a huddle of angular buildings to provide a
"peekaboo" effect from the street. And despite community objections, especially to the government invocation of eminent domain (a.k.a. expropriation) to help Ratner acquire the land, the state finally gave the go-ahead to the development at the end of 2006, along with hundreds of millions in subsidies.
Since then, however, progress at Atlantic Yards has been about as speedy as construction at Ground Zero. And opponents have grown more vocal and better organized. Last month, when the Brooklyn Museum held its spring gala, the black-tie crowd had to push its way past a line of placard-wielding protesters upset that the museum - which otherwise has a very good relationship with its constituency - had chosen to use the occasion to honour Ratner, one of its benefactors. (Some opponents have a problem with perspective: One commenter on a blog account of the gala compared Ratner to Charles Manson and Hitler.) And last week, when the Observer published its list of the 100 Most Powerful People in New York Real Estate, Ratner was number eight, Gehry number 51, and the anti-Atlantic Yards blogger Norman Oder landed at number 77.
But then, real estate in this city is a blood sport and nothing ever gets built without some of the little people being crushed. Ratner has already defeated 18 lawsuits, and he obviously believes he can kill the remaining handful, including one that challenges the legitimacy of the state's environmental review. But while he has to wait for the courts to deal with those cases before he can build, another foe already has him on the ropes: the collapsing credit market.
When Atlantic Yards was first announced, it had an estimated price tag of $2.5-billion; that has since ballooned to $4-billion, almost one-quarter of which, an eye-popping $950-million, is allocated to the arena alone. This spring, when Forest City Ratner, the developer's company, admitted it was considering radical changes to help get the project back on track, the Times' influential architecture critic Nicolai Ouroussoff, who had initially been a champion, suggested Gehry was being reduced to the role of a name-brand fig leaf and should walk away rather than compromise on his vision.
But Gehry isn't the type to quit, and two weeks ago, in a bid to re-ignite civic interest in the project, the company unveiled some radical new designs: The arena has lost its sails and is now apparently wrapped in titanium folds and flanked by only four buildings, one of which looks like a series of bird cages stacked precariously atop one another at a dangerous diagonal. The now dubbed B1 replaces the former Miss Brooklyn and promises to rise to only about 160 metres. B2, which will be built first, is a red-and-pink agglomeration reminiscent of a hillside shantytown.
Last Thursday evening, in a cultural contrast as stark as they come, the anti-Atlantic Yards organization Develop Don't Destroy Brooklyn held a benefit concert at the Park Slope club Southpaw, while across the river - in Manhattan, that is - Forest City Ratner used the publicity over the new designs to kick off the sale of the arena's 130 luxury boxes with a splashy party on the 38th floor of the New York Times building. (The Times new headquarters was developed by Forest City Ratner, which has frequently caused Brooklynites to be skeptical of its coverage of Atlantic Yards.)
The admission fee for the Southpaw event, which featured a screening of the anti-Atlantic Yards documentary Brooklyn Matters and music by John Wesley Harding, was $15. The average annual lease fee on the luxury suites is $300,000; if you're feeling flush - say you work at JPMorgan rather than Bear Stearns - you could pony up $540,000 a year for one of 12 "elite" boxes, which, in an illustration that rich people operate in a different sphere of logic, are actually bunkers, located under the bleachers, with no view of the action (though they do each come with eight courtside seats).
Atlantic Yards isn't the only large-scale development in trouble. At the end of March, the developer Tishman Speyer was granted the rights to build office space, parklands, and residential towers on Manhattan's West Side Railyards. But two weeks ago, when it couldn't change the terms of the billion-dollar deal it had just agreed to, it walked off like a spoiled child. The Bloomberg Administration now has two failures to its credit in that one spot, after its ill-fated plan for a football stadium died with its Olympic bid.
Still, the administration, which doesn't seem to grasp that New York is a city of people who live at street level, continues to push these sorts of high concept developments. Up in Harlem, city council has just approved a rezoning that will see skyscraping office buildings and luxury condos consume historic 125th Street. The local community was opposed to it, of course. Not that it mattered.

Full text: Sunny Australian Helene Joy talks to Gayle MacDonald about her path to Toronto, and her role in the intensely dark Durham County
The Australian-born actress Helene Joy is well named.
Impossibly upbeat - with an infectious laugh that echoes (often) through the lounge in Toronto's Drake Hotel - it's tough at first to identify this sunny creature with the angst-ridden character she portrays in the brooding drama Durham County , to be broadcast starting tonight on Global TV.
In the six-part miniseries, Joy plays Audrey Sweeney, one of the least troubled, relatively uncomplicated characters in this critically lauded program.
"There's no question, the show is pretty grim," says Joy, who was born in Perth and moved to Canada about six years ago with a Canadian boyfriend she'd met in Queensland filming an episode of, of all things, Flipper .
"When I read the opening scene of Durham County , I wasn't sure I could do this role. But, as I kept on, I thought the script was absolutely brilliant," adds the redhead. "And even more, I was fascinated that something this dark and disturbing was the concoction of a creative team that is basically all women."
Durham County is the brainchild of Back Alley Film Production partners Adrienne Mitchell and Janis Lundman. It was written by Laurie Finstad-Knizhnik, and was directed by Holly Dale and Mitchell. It initially aired on the pay channels Movie Network and Movie Central last May. It's getting its second window on conventional television, on Global.
A warning to anyone remotely queasy: In the first five minutes, two teenage girls are murdered, brutally and onscreen, while "an eye" watches through the bushes. The peeping sociopath then has his way with one of the apparently dead girls after the killer leaves a clearing in the woods. "We were all a little nervous about the whole thing," says Joy. "But we thought Durham County would excite more people than it would disturb. And it has done that."
The show is anything but the typical cop-versus-killer drama. The story is deliberately ambiguous. The characters are even more so. At the crux is Detective Mike Sweeney (Audrey's husband, played by Hugh Dillon), who moves his family to the suburbs only to become obsessed with hunting a serial killer (turns out there are two) who he is convinced is his neighbour, Ray Prager (Justin Louis).
"My character is one of the relatively stable ones," Joy says, chuckling. "I play a neglected wife who has just survived a harrowing bout of breast cancer, and has lost a breast. In the meantime, my whole family has torn itself apart. My children are dysfunctional and have turned against me because they thought I was going to die. My husband has fallen out of love.
"I had to tap down deep to play this role. They padded me up here," she says, pointing to one breast. "And taped me down here," indicating the other, "to look like I'd had a masectomy. It was so real, it made me feel ill. I can't imagine what it must be like for these women who are grateful to be alive but still traumatized by what has happened to their bodies. I had horribly torn feelings."
Joy hopes that Global/TMN/Movie Central will go ahead with a second season of a show that challenges its actors and its viewers equally: "It's looking 90-per-cent positive that Durham County will go again. If it does, I couldn't be happier. The acting - by Hugh, and the others - is fabulous."
A green light, however, will also make Joy's already hectic schedule even crazier. "If we start in September, I'll be shooting Durham County in Montreal and The Murdoch Mysteries in Toronto. Don't get me wrong: I'm not complaining. I love the work, which is far more plentiful here in Canada than it was at home," says Joy.
In CITY-TV's Murdoch Mysteries , she's the female lead, Dr. Julia Ogden. And recently on CBC-TV's short-lived hockey drama, MVP , she played the team doctor, a role she loved for one very specific reason. "I got to play most of my scenes with Peter Miller, who's gorgeous. He was half-naked most of the time, which was great fun." MVP , recently picked up by Disney's SOAPnet, premieres June 19 in the United States.
Trained at the Western Australian Academy of Performing Arts, Joy says the only thing she doesn't like about Canada - besides the cold weather - is the people who bash Canadian-made television.
"Australians watch their own shows," she says. "And we do that because there are laws in place that require much larger amounts of spending content to be indigenous. Most people at home still only have five channels, so they know their talent."
The youngest daughter of a single mother (now a successful real-estate agent in Perth), Joy says her spare time is spent biking around Toronto, learning French, the guitar, and sewing things for her friends. For at least six weeks a year, she dons a backpack and heads to warmer climates, often South and Central America.
"I haven't taken a traditional path. That's never been the case with me. But I'm glad I met that nice Canadian boy," Joy says with a smile, referring to her Flipper cast-mate who is still a good friend. "It started a whole new tangent of my life that I never expected."
Durham County airs at 10 tonight on Global (Check local listings).

Full text: The man behind a luxe condo project on Oakville's splashiest estate wants the property's shoreline to stay closed to the public
From inside Edgemere Estate, the largest private property on Oakville's "millionaires' row," there is a stunning view of Lake Ontario sparkling in the bright afternoon sun.
For a century, this view and Edgemere's 300 metres of shoreline have been the exclusive preserve of the five-hectare estate's wealthy proprietors - and if Edgemere's newest owner wins a looming battle with Oakville town hall, it will stay that way.
A consortium led by veteran developer Marc Hewitt wants to tear down the 32,000-square-foot mansion built by Edgemere's previous owner, Mattamy Homes president Peter Gilgan, and replace it with a community of 10 2½-storey luxury condominiums with three units each.
Most controversially, Mr. Hewitt would like the property's shoreline to remain closed to the public, setting the stage for a potential challenge to Oakville's policy of forcing developers to turn over a 15-metre strip of lakefront land when a waterfront estate is redeveloped.
The reclamation policy, a bedrock of planning in Oakville, has helped the town open about one-third of its shoreline to the public in the past 45 years. Town officials would like to add Edgemere's lakefront land to their collection; they are already looking at reclaiming a treed area on the property's western boundary that would help them to connect the estate's shoreline to an existing public pathway, said Oakville Councillor Keith Bird.
Mr. Bird and other members of Oakville council are working to kill Mr. Hewitt's application to change the property's zoning. The application has been submitted to the town's planning staff, who are expected to give the plan the thumbs up or down by this fall.
"[Our] plan is to have a linear trail," said Mr. Bird, who has already gathered more than 400 signatures from residents opposed to Mr. Hewitt's plan. "A condo-style development, with private cobblestone roads, what I understand would be a gated community, would cut off public access to waterfront land."
However, Mr. Hewitt said he and his partners insist it would be "inappropriate" to make Edgemere's shoreline public. Mr. Hewitt has yet to sit down and hash out his differences with the town - it's still too early in the process - but when he does, the developer plans to offer the town cash to spruce up other public spaces in exchange for an exemption from the reclamation policy.
"We acknowledge that the town has a right to acquire a 5-per-cent conveyance under the planning act. But our point is we're not sure that's appropriate given the isolated character of the property. It is disconnected from any pathway, so what purpose would it serve?"
If planning staff and Oakville council turn down his rezoning request, Mr. Hewitt can appeal their decision to the Ontario Municipal Board - a process he would be familiar with as a big player in the development game in greater Toronto.
(He also knows a thing or two about development worldwide: Mr. Hewitt is the former head of development for Emaar Properties, a Middle Eastern real-estate behemoth best known for erecting the Burj Dubai, the glittering condo and office building that last year surpassed the height of the CN Tower.)
In what is a common strategy in the development industry, Mr. Hewitt assembled a new company last year specifically to buy and develop the Gilgan property at 1502 Lakeshore Rd. E. The company, Edgemere Estate Ltd., bought the property in September for a reported $35.5-million after it had been languishing on the market for 18 months.
(When the property was put on the market for $45-million in 2006, it was the most expensive residential listing in Canadian history.)
The consortium is a limited partnership composed of four partners. The board of directors includes Mr. Hewitt, T. James Tadeson, the chief executive officer of InStorage real estate investment trust, and Peter Carver, a principal with Carttera Private Equities Inc., a Toronto-based equity management company. Mr. Hewitt would not say, and the company's partnership documents don't divulge, who the four partners or partner companies are and what financial stake they have in the Edgemere project.
But it is clear the consortium is, at the least, aiming to triple its initial investment. The proposed luxury condo units, ranging in size from 3,000 to 6,200 square feet, and designed by acclaimed Toronto architect Peter Clewes, will cost from $3-million to more than $6-million apiece.
"But this isn't about making money," Mr. Hewitt says. "This is about doing the right thing."
Mr. Hewitt warns the alternative to his plan could be much worse. The land is zoned for as many as 17 single-family homes in a traditional subdivision. If he were to go this route, much travelled in Oakville, then most of the 420 trees that dot the property would have to be cut down to make way for the houses.
As well, property lines would run through many of Edgemere's historic buildings, meaning they would have to be demolished. These include a trellised teahouse, the old Keeper's Lodge and a wall made from lake stones pulled from the shallow waters close to shore.
"We want to maintain the spaciousness of the property, not cover the property," says Mr. Hewitt. "We want to preserve the idea of a grand estate. If we subdivide, then a whole piece of local cultural history will be lost."
If Oakville's planning policies stipulate that Edgemere's waterfront must be returned to the public upon redevelopment, how likely is it that Mr. Hewitt's blueprint for a walled condo community will be approved as submitted?
The case hinges on a technicality. Mr. Hewitt's proposal envisions putting all 10 three-unit luxury condos on the site of the Gilgan home and swimming pool, with no new lots being created. When Mr. Gilgan built his new home on the property in 1995, the town did not reclaim any part of Edgemere's waterfront.
"That is key, that they are not creating new lots," says Councillor Mary Chapin. "The dedication of the waterfront is triggered when a property is redeveloped and some will interpret that to mean subdivide and because he is not subdividing he may feel he does not need to dedicate the waterfront." Unlike some of her council colleagues, Ms. Chapin thinks Mr. Hewitt's proposal could be positive. It fills a niche. Oakville does not have any high-end condos today. But she is more concerned for the common good.
"If [Mr. Hewitt] had his way, it would be a highly desirable and exclusive community. I can understand why he'd want to do that," she continues, speaking from her Oakville home. "But it's not in the community's best interest or the town's."
An historic jewel
Some sprawling estates on Oakville's "millionaires' row" have been redeveloped as suburban subdivisions. But the Edgemere property, which boasts a rich history, has remained relatively untouched.
In 1907, James Ryrie (partner of jeweller Henry Birk) bought the land, eventually erecting a vacation home on it.
Later owners include John E. Hammell, a Canadian prize-fighter-turned-mining magnate, in the thirties. Mr. Hammell had an art collection that included works by Titian and Rembrandt.
In the mid-1990s, Mattamy Homes president Peter Gilgan tore down the original arts-and-crafts-style residence to make room for a nine-bedroom, 17-bathroom home for his family of eight.
Historic elements, such as the boathouse, stables and Japanese sculpture garden, have largely remained intact over the years.

Full text: Hills and forests of the Balkan state are being levelled to make room for new hotels and resorts
'Experience the wild beauty" is Montenegro's newest tourist slogan.
But while the beauty of the "pearl of the Adriatic" is undeniable, the wilderness is disappearing.
The tiny Balkan state - nestled in the southeast corner of Europe - is a breathtaking mix of colours: blazing blue skies, lush green mountains, white pebble beaches and the turquoise Adriatic Sea.
But since splitting from much larger Serbia in 2006, Montenegro has experienced a real-estate boom, with mostly Russians and Britons investing en masse in new hotels, resorts and even complete new villages.
The result: narrow, winding roads along the coastline are jammed with construction trucks, while hills and forests are being levelled to accommodate new concrete structures that dot the landscape.
A small peninsula that used to be a thick pine forest at the entrance to Montenegro's main resort of Budva is being turned into a Dubai-style skyscraper hotel, surrounded by a dozen luxury villas.
"The nature is spectacular, but it is sad to watch how it is being eroded," said Donna Jones, an English retiree vacationing in Budva, in the centre of Montenegro's 290-kilometre-long Riviera.
Tourism is surging in Montenegro after a decade of bloody Balkan wars in the 1990s slowed the stream of visitors to a trickle. Most tourists now come from Russia, but the sparkling sea waters and stony mountain peaks increasingly draw Western visitors.
According to official statistics, 1.1 million tourists visited last year, a 50-per-cent increase over 2000, a figure that makes it clear the tiny republic is back on the map.
But Montenegro is still considered a bargain tourist destination for Westerners. A room in a private home starts at $30 a night, about half the price of a similar room in a beach town in neighbouring Croatia.
In new luxury hotels on the Becici beach south of Budva, the prices for a double room can start at $160.
Sveti Stefan, just south of Budva, is a tiny peninsula whose sun-bleached limestone homes were turned from a fishing village to a luxury hotel complex in the 1960s. It is currently under reconstruction after being taken over by a Singaporean company.
Sveti Stefan, once frequented by movie stars such as Sylvester Stallone, Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton, is seen from the towering mountains above as a tiny shining jewel neatly placed onto deep blue sea waters.
Its 15th-century stone walls, narrow streets and red-tile roofs shimmer in the sunlight - with oleander, bougainvillea and palms providing green and shade.
Close by is Budva, featuring a quaint, stonewalled old town with its maze of little lanes lined with shops and restaurants buzzing with activity. With its Venetian fortress walls, Budva is a miniature version of Dubrovnik, the much better known Croatian resort just to the north.
Some of Montenegro's best restaurants are located in Budva's neighbourhood. But those who seek a change from the classic Mediterranean scenery can visit restaurants located on wooden rafts on the Bojana River, covered with marsh grass and flocks of wild geese, where it flows into the Adriatic in the far south of the Riviera.
The must-have Montenegrin meal includes loza (a strong brandy made from grapes) as a before-dinner drink; hors d'oeuvre of traditional, extra-dry ham and goat cheese dipped in olive oil; followed by grilled fish spiced with garlic and parsley, all coupled with famous Montenegrin Vranac red wine. Such a meal costs about $64 a person, without a customary 10-per-cent tip. Even though Montenegro is not a European Union country, the euro is its official currency.
The best time to visit Montenegro is in the off-season - May, the beginning of June and the end of September - as the Montenegrin Riviera tends to become overcrowded with tourists escaping scorching summer heat, sometimes even triggering water shortages.
"The main tourist season now lasts four months, compared to two months not so long ago," said Nikola Lazarevic, owner of the Grispolis restaurant in the quiet village of Bigova - just north of Budva - perched on a deep sea bay nestled between hills covered with ancient olive trees.
A day excursion from Budva to Mount Lovcen via the village of Njegusi, home of the best dried ham in the Balkans, is popular among tourists. Nearly all of the tiny country can be seen from the top of the mountain that is still covered with snow as late as May.
Another worthwhile excursion is to Boka Kotorska, the largest T-shaped bay on the Adriatic, with the town of Kotor, whose stone-covered plazas and medieval churches are listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
"Montenegro has become a real tourist destination, and is no longer a wild little place in Europe's backyard," Lazarevic said as he insisted on serving another loza - on the house - in traditional Montenegrin hospitality.

Full text: The hottest ticket in Vancouver this week was not for a concert or a play, but a lunch hosted by the Urban Development Institute. And they call this place No Fun City.
The guest speaker was local condo merchant Bob Rennie, whose take on the city's unrelenting real-estate market is considered by many to be as reliable as government bonds. The event was sold out weeks ago.
To call Mr. Rennie a condo seller doesn't quite do him justice. In the past 10 years or so his company - Rennie Marketing Systems - has sold more than 10,000 units. Last year, sales totalled $1.5-billion. Not bad for a kid who grew up without much on the city's east side - long before homes there became million-dollar lottery tickets.
The 51-year-old's success has helped him put together a much-prized personal art collection, buy a gold Bentley coupe and purchase the zillion-dollar home he lives in.
Mr. Rennie is constantly evaluating and judging the market, betting on where it is - and isn't - going. For the past decade, that's been pretty easy. The sales-and-price trend in Vancouver has graphed in pretty much one direction: up. But many in Mr. Rennie's audience this week were anticipating he'd be forced to deviate from his usual cheery script.
In fact, hours before he rose to speak, media outlets were reporting private-sector forecasts that showed the Canadian housing market cooling. Scotiabank warned that price gains from housing would ease in 2008 and slow down further in 2009.
If there is a slowdown under way, Vancouver seems to be immune from it. At least, if we're to believe the mind-boggling numbers provided by Mr. Rennie.
Consider this: Of the 2,743 condominiums expected to be finished this year, nearly 90 per cent are already sold. There are 2,925 condos scheduled to be completed in 2009; 98 per cent of those are sold. And 83 per cent of the 714 that will be finished in 2010 are gone.
Many of the condominiums are attached to luxury hotel developments. Mr. Rennie is selling 123 units at the Ritz-Carlton, which is scheduled to be completed by 2011. Actually, he's already sold 60 per cent of them at an average of $2,300 a square foot. That's right, a 1,000-square-foot condo in downtown Vancouver that you can't get into until 2011 will cost you $2.3-million.
Mr. Rennie said he used to joke that the per-square-foot cost of a condo in the city would be 2010 by 2010. Well, 2010 a square foot has come and gone.
The Ritz is asking $29-million for its penthouse suite, by the way. The one in the Residences at the Hotel Georgia sold recently for $18-million. And Mr. Rennie just unloaded the penthouse at the Shangri La, which isn't even completed yet, for $16-million. Three years ago, that same penthouse, not yet built and 1,000 square feet smaller, was on the market for $5.3-million.
Can you believe these numbers?
Who's buying up all the condos in the city? Well, a good percentage of the purchasers, as it turns out, are offshore investors, people making scads of money in China and Korea, Iran and Europe. And now, according to Mr. Rennie, Russia's nouveaux riches are moving into the market in a big way.
Personally, I don't get it. There are other cities in North America that have far more going for them than Vancouver but have not witnessed nearly the same run on their real estate. Chicago is one that comes to mind.
In Vancouver's case, the old real-estate adage - location, location, location - seems to be true. The value of the city's land and housing seems to be mostly about where the old town is situated.
Yes, you can live an outdoorsy lifestyle here. And there are some great restaurants. But let's face it, much of the architecture is third rate and the city is bereft of the kind of cultural institutions that define great cities; that define the world-class city Mr. Rennie believes Vancouver is.
I don't see it. Not yet.
Now, having foreign investors gobbling up the condo market isn't all bad. Many have no interest in living in the units they own. They probably don't even know what they look like. So they rent them out to people who effectively pay the owner's mortgage, which is how the rich get richer. But the investor condo has become an important supply of rental housing in the city, which is dwindling at an alarming rate.
Who knows where this is all heading. Listen to Mr. Rennie and there appears to be no end in sight to the fantastic escalation in real-estate prices here. He may be right. In Paris, real estate is now so expensive investors are buying 1/11th of an apartment, according to a story in yesterday's New York Times.
Anyone want to go in on a condo with me?

Abstract: Ameya's developers say they're addressing many of the same issues. Marketing materials note that at least 80 per cent of the development's nearly 11,000 acres are to be set aside as conservation easements, permanently protecting them from development. There's no binding agreement to do so beyond the developers' pledge; they've received preliminary approval for the project's first phase and expect final approval early next year.

Full text: The builders of some new second-home communities are trying to take the guilt out of owning a holiday retreat
People wracked with guilt about owning a second home might be an odd market for second-home developers. But that's the target audience for a handful of communities designed to make people feel better about owning a getaway.
Among the "guilt offsets" builders are touting: ski resorts in Lake Tahoe and Massachusetts powered by wind, and a Georgia golf community where most land is set aside as a nature preserve. The Red Mountain ski resort in British Columbia stresses that many staffers own homes nearby and don't have to commute from afar because they're priced out of the market.
The Ameya Preserve, a 300-home development seeking final approval in Paradise Valley, Mont., is kicking politically correct development up a notch. Developers have offered to sponsor teachers at the nearby high school, made building proposals that take climate change into account and promised money to non-profits such as Habitat for Humanity.
They've even signed up Alice Waters, the Bay Area restaurateur who advocates organic and local food distribution in her books and speeches, and established a Berkeley public-school program to improve children's diets. The culinary superstar is in talks with the Ameya developers to help guide the establishment of a high-end restaurant and culinary school there.
The merging of expensive-home building with high-minded values can be fraught, as critics home in on perceived examples of "greenwashing" - portraying a development as more environmentally friendly than it actually is.
Pete Feigley, a local biologist who's spoken out widely against the Ameya Preserve, questions the science behind its claim that the development will offset the environmental impact of each home by planting trees in other parts of the country, and says that the "heli-skiing" promoted on Ameya's website isn't environmentally friendly. (Ameya says there are no heli-skiing plans and that the website mention was an error.)
Others say it's a stretch to call any second-home development green: "The greenest second home is no home at all," says Richard Faesy, a senior project manager at Vermont Energy Investment Corp., a non-profit organization promoting energy efficiency.
In general, second-home developers are looking beyond traditional models like golf, beach and ski resorts to stand out. One development in Ocala, Fla., targets recreational pilots; another, near Dallas, includes an auto race track. Other developments promote philanthropy and community service.
"Green" developments today need to do more than just emphasize environmentally friendly materials. One new approach is to publicize how little of the total acreage will be developed. Homestead Preserve, a nature and golf resort in Hot Springs, Va., set aside more than 9,000 of its 11,500 acres as a nature preserve, through a sale to the Nature Conservancy.
Other developers pledge that new homes won't displace existing residents. Howard Katkov, who owns the British Columbia ski resort touting its staff's local homes, says the long commutes for workers at many mega-resorts are "a bad dynamic." Such a situation, he adds, "bleaches the soul out of a ski resort."
Ameya's developers say they're addressing many of the same issues. Marketing materials note that at least 80 per cent of the development's nearly 11,000 acres are to be set aside as conservation easements, permanently protecting them from development. There's no binding agreement to do so beyond the developers' pledge; they've received preliminary approval for the project's first phase and expect final approval early next year.
Last spring, the Ameya group promised to be in the vanguard of "carbon neutral" residential projects in the United States. They will pay for the reforestation of land in the lower Mississippi Valley in order to offset the impact of fossil fuels burned by residents travelling to and using the homes. They've also made donations to a local museum, provided land to a farming organization and pledged to build one Habitat for Humanity home for every 50 homes built at Ameya.
"We're going so much further than has ever been done," says developer Wade Dokken, who adds that he's working with the environmental group Conservation Fund on the carbon-neutral plan. Lawrence Selzer, the fund's president, says the group is still figuring out how many trees must be planted to offset Ameya's impact.
Together with his partners, Mr. Dokken - former chief executive of annuities firm American Skandia Inc. - paid $23-million (U.S.) for nearly 9,500 acres of land, plus a lease of another 1,280 acres from the state, in a 2005 deal. (The developers hope to buy the leased land.) Moose, mountain lions and bald eagles populate the forests, mountains and rolling plains. Home sites at Ameya range from $700,000 to $2.3-million.
Peter Oundjian, music director of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, will curate a summer-music series and oversee other music activities. Jack Horner, the paleontologist best known for inspiring the protagonist of Jurassic Park , will lead a dinosaur dig on the site, with Ameya homeowners invited to participate.
The developers contributed more than $3-million to the Museum of the Rockies, where Mr. Horner is curator of paleontology; the money will fund 15 years of research on the dig, among other projects.
"In my business, I'm basically a professional beggar," Mr. Horner says. "I'm always looking for people who will help me with the funding to keep our excavations going."
Ms. Waters has signed a one-year deal to help guide plans for a cooking school on the property. She helped forge relationships between Ameya and two close associates, Jean-Pierre Moulle, currently the executive chef of Chez Panisse restaurant, and Cristina Salas-Porras, her former assistant, and says that if they're in charge of executing her vision for the restaurant and school, she will continue to be involved in the long term, though she isn't exactly sure what that involvement will entail.
Currently, Mr. Moulle and Ms. Salas-Porras both have letters of agreement with Ameya and are negotiating contracts. Mr. Moulle says that when the school and restaurant are open, he expects that he will spend about half the year living in a house on the Ameya Preserve (Mr. Dokken says his housing will be free).
Ms. Salas-Porras is currently on retainer with Ameya and has travelled out to Montana to meet with area farmers and ranchers and begun working with the developers on general design concepts and other plans.
"We're going to build it and program it to Alice's standards," says Mr. Dokken. "Our goal is to have a very long relationship, and I think we will."
A recent Neiman Marcus Christmas-catalogue ad shows how Ameya is using cultural figures to market itself: For $2.3-million, a buyer gets a 10-acre home site, plus a meal "directed by chef Alice Waters," with entertainment provided by soprano Renee Fleming, Mr. Oundjian or violinist Joshua Bell, the ad says. Ms. Waters says she has firmly committed to this part of the project and that she will be paid to decide how this meal is prepared.
Ms. Waters says she signed onto the project because Mr. Dokken agreed to pledge $100,000 to Slow Food Nation, an organization she founded: "I wanted the money for Slow Food." It's hosting a food festival in San Francisco next Labour Day weekend.
"Slow Food Nation will celebrate, explore, and educate about food that is delicious, ecologically sustainable and socially just," a news release says.
While some critics have scrutinized Ameya's environmental and charitable claims, others have focused on Ms. Waters's involvement. "No one would bat an eyelash if this were Emeril or Wolfgang Puck or Mario Batali," says David Kamp, author of The United States of Arugula , a recent history of food culture. But, in addition to her long-time noncommercial stance, Ms. Waters "has been unhesitant to criticize those who engage in commercial activities," Mr. Kamp says, citing an e-mail she sent to chef Rick Bayless criticizing him for appearing in a Burger King commercial in 2003. A spokeswoman for Mr. Bayless declined to comment.
"It's one thing to do Burger King and another the Ameya Preserve. They are not in the same category," Ms. Waters says, adding: "Whenever you take money you're compromising yourself. Most people who have money have strings attached, but there are definitely better and worse ones."

ASKING PRICE: $1,088,000
SELLING PRICE: $1,045,000
TAXES: $6,755 (2007)
LOT SIZE: 50 by 131 feet
DAYS ON THE MARKET: 11
LISTING AND CO-OP AGENT: Bill Thom, Re/Max Realtron Realty Inc.
Finding a five-bedroom property in the Bayview and Sheppard area can be challenging, so when this custom-built house came on the market, a local family made an offer fairly quickly, according to their agent, Bill Thom.
"A lot of the homes built in the area are more like four-bedroom [plans]," he says,
The sellers built this two-storey, brick house more than 12 years ago. With 3,800 square feet, it includes four bathrooms and two laundry rooms, as well as a library and a family room with fireplace on the main floor.
There is more potential living space in the unfinished basement, which has above-grade windows and - like the main floor - nine-foot ceilings. A sense of spaciousness is created in the foyer by its two-storey height, a solid oak floating staircase and a skylight.
The combined living and dining room has moulded ceilings, pot lights and French doors to the eat-in kitchen. The latter is finished with ceramic floors and backsplashes, and includes granite counters, a pantry and a walkout to a deck. Hardwood flooring covers this level, while the bedrooms upstairs have broadloom.
Of the bedrooms, the master and a secondary bedroom have walk-in closets and private bathrooms. The master's marble ensuite contains six pieces, including a whirlpool tub, Mr. Thom says.
Also upstairs is the main bathroom. A powder room is located on the ground floor.
Handy features include central vacuum, alarm and intercom systems. There is direct access to the double garage.

From the chateau, you can walk out to a stone terrace and the grounds.
Next to the house is a 17th-century stone chapel and a swimming pool.
The property is used for seasonal rentals but could be converted into a private home.
The village of Saignon, with a population of about 1,000, features a 12th-century church. Local walking trails end with views of the Alpes-de-Haute-Provence and the heights of Avignon.
Asking price : $4,261,636 (U.S.), or about $4,325,000.

New Urbanism's Moses comes to Tsawwassen

Abstract: They were pioneering only in the rustic architectural vocabulary that popped up in the drawings. Call it "pseudo-agro vernacular" - Mr. [Andres Duany] cited 19th-century rural Swedish agricultural buildings as valid sources for building "up here in the north," on the shores of "Bounty Bay" (the Floridian actually meant to say Boundary Bay, the body of water separating Point Roberts from Surrey).

Full text: The 13th of May brought several downer developments - and it wasn't even a Friday. First, huge layoffs were announced at Canadian auto plants, in large part because our factories turn out vehicle lines tending toward SUVs and light trucks, and Americans have stopped buying both.
Later the same day things got even glummer, though the setting could not have been nicer - a huge rented tent beside a big red barn in South Delta. Century Group would like to turn these fields straddling the communities of Boundary Bay and Tsawwassen into the hub of a new suburban community for 5,000 people. The occasion was the presentation of drawings and ideas produced for this pastoral site in a design charrette stage-managed by Andres Duany, the co-founder of New Urbanism.
Worse and worse, I thought, as I watched Mr. Duany and his flown-in team present a vision of leafy low-density suburbia while claiming for themselves a front line position in the good green wars. Mr. Duany boasted the schemes he presented were "pioneering designs."
They were pioneering only in the rustic architectural vocabulary that popped up in the drawings. Call it "pseudo-agro vernacular" - Mr. Duany cited 19th-century rural Swedish agricultural buildings as valid sources for building "up here in the north," on the shores of "Bounty Bay" (the Floridian actually meant to say Boundary Bay, the body of water separating Point Roberts from Surrey).
In the Lower Mainland's urban fringes, we still take New Urbanism seriously, in the same way we still lust after Ford Explorers. My own view is that history will regard New Urbanism as a last-gasp attempt to reform suburbanism from within, before high energy prices and new respect for land compels much denser development.
This new wave of high density combined with high amenity is homegrown. It has turned the very word "Vancouver" into a verb and an ideology: progressive cities now "Vancouverize" because they believe in "Vancouverism."
We Vancouverites sell American planners and developers high density, high amenity urban development attuned to the needs of the new century. Then local developers like the Century Group go consultant shopping in Miami and end up buying the terminally pleasant nostalgia of New Urbanism. Go figure.
Actually, checking the figures helps puncture New Urbanism's claims, especially the spiel that schemes like the one for the Southlands development present a radical increase in suburban residential densities. While this may be true by the standards of the sunbelt United States, Canadian cities have historically developed at higher densities, largely because we lack such sprawl-inducing public policies as the tax deductibility of mortgage interest and the federally funded interstate highway system.
New Urbanism is dangerous because it claims to cure the very sprawl and social class separation that it causes. There are worse ways to develop the suburbs, but none are so two-faced. The New Urbanism is city planning's equivalent of the "compact SUV."
The movement, led by Mr. Duany and partner Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk, is a compromise position that will be doomed by greater forces. Mr. Duany's two Southlands proposals, nicknamed "Tuck" and "Sweep," offer us a Honda Element and Land Rover LR2 when what Tsawwassen really needs is a Prius or Smart car.
The stakes are huge for the Century Group, which is owned by the long-established South Delta Hodgins family. I cannot fathom the convolutions of land use policies that left Southlands' 531 acres outside of B.C.'s Agricultural Land Reserve boundaries, but such is the case. Almost 20 years ago, a proposal to put 1,895 homes here from former owner George Spetifore was defeated by the regional council, because of objections to the sprawl it would induce across the entire Point Roberts peninsula.
If the Century Group's larger proposal is approved, the 2,000 housing units planned there will be worth between $1-billion and $2-billion, so a few hundred thousand spent on a lavish design charrette with pricey imported talent is chump change.
Century Group is sensitive to perceptions of this area as a bucolic or natural zone. It proposes that about one third of Southlands' site be left in a semi-natural state, one third used for intensive gardens for residents, and one third for yards and houses. That said, the net density will be barely four dwelling units per acre, only a 5 per cent increase from the defeated 1989 proposal.
As someone who occasionally does public lecturing and urban design consulting, I bow down in awe before Mr. Duany's marshalling of facts and features for a site he has visited only a few times (though he is buttressed by a squad of a dozen sub-consultants in every imaginable specialty).
Mr. Duany is a superb speaker and even better salesman, but Vancouver has New Urbanists who are his design equals, notably two teacher-consultants: University of British Columbia's Patrick Condon and Simon Fraser University's Michael von Hausen.
But even in the hands of designers as talented as all of these, New Urbanism is a dead letter. I hope South Delta rethinks things before this mock-utopia of gardens and lanes gets built.

Seaside splendour

Author: Millman, Joel

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/seaside-splendour/docview/382713048/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: "People saw neighbourhoods becoming commercial zones," says Mr. Williams, who has lived in Cannon Beach since 1972. "We've reached a good compromise: We haven't banned short-term rentals, but we've limited them."

Full text: Cannon Beach has no hospital, pharmacy or mail delivery, but for most residents, none of that really matters
The Coaster Theater in Cannon Beach, Ore., has a full slate of comedies, dramas and musicals scheduled for 2008, with a subscription to the complete package of seven performances available at $100 (U.S.) a seat.
That's one of the few bargains left in Cannon Beach, a seaside town that has become a prime destination for retirees from Portland and Seattle, especially those with money. "Healthy, wealthy professionals. That's the profile," says real estate attorney Charles Hillestad, who moved there with his wife 13 years ago from Denver to ease into retirement while running a small local practice.
With about 1,600 year-round residents, Cannon Beach is tucked between Oregon's lush Ecola State Park and a stunning coastal archipelago punctuated by massive Haystack Rock. Summer temperatures rarely climb above 21 degrees C; winters are mild, if wet.
There's a civility about the place that's carefully cultivated. Strict rules govern renting homes to vacationers, operating a bed and breakfast or erecting signs at commercial sites. Fast-food restaurants are banned. (Officially, Cannon Beach prohibits establishments "required by contractual or other arrangements to offer standardized menus, ingredients, food preparation, interior or exterior design, or uniforms.") Bookstores abound, but there's only one gas station, outside of town at the RV park.
Indeed, Cannon Beach, on close inspection, seems to lack many of the amenities that people often associate with a retirement destination. The town has no hospital or pharmacy and no assisted-living facility. There's no mail delivery, either; letters and packages have to be retrieved at the post office. In short, it's no place to be frail or infirm.
It is, however, a place of uncommon beauty and a surprising amount of activity, given the town's size. Art is the big draw. Galleries open the busy summer season with a "Spring Unveiling" in May, then kick off the Thanksgiving-to-New-Year period with the Stormy Weather Arts Festival in early November. Glasses of complimentary white wine and local pinot, plates of shrimp hors d'oeuvres and puff pastries help fill the galleries with locals and visitors.
"It takes care of your dinner for the night," says Martha Bennett, a retiree active in Cannon Beach's amateur chorus, 30 singers who have been together since 1988 and practice every Monday night at the Cannon Beach Community Presbyterian Church.
Hemlock Street, the town's main drag, runs parallel to the Pacific shoreline. A few wood-shingle homes have been converted into pricey restaurants, including one serving Thai food and another offering cuisine from northern Italy. The southern end of Hemlock Street is given over mostly to single-storey motels and beach cottages, which are packed in summer months and draw a steady weekend trade through early autumn.
It's not all the carriage trade. Bird-watching and beach strolls are free. Haystack Rock, which rises to a height of 235 feet, is Cannon Beach's landmark. At low tide, the sand nearby reveals a treasure-trove of sand dollars (many tiny enough to be sand dimes) and occasionally is graced by sunning sea lions.
Retirees flock to the $5 "Burgers & Jam" on Monday nights at American Legion Post No. 168, as well as the post's monthly "Oyster Feed" ($12) and a $5 Saturday breakfast also offered once a month.
Seaside and Warrenton, respectively 12 and 32 kilometres away, are Cannon Beach's satellite business districts. Seaside has the closest hospital and pharmacy; Warrenton has the nearest Costco and Fred Meyer, a big Oregon retailer.
Catering mainly to Portlanders who make the 125-kilometre trip for a day or weekend during summer months, Cannon Beach grew its retirement niche from families who built second homes there, which became permanent homes as family nests emptied. A new element has been introduced in recent years as dot-com fortunes seep in from California and Seattle. That's brought a wave of teardowns followed by the rise of seaside McMansions.
Local officials are focused on trying to control commercial development. Bed-and-breakfast operators can offer lodging in no more than two bedrooms, and owners must live on the property. John Williams, a retiree who was elected Cannon Beach's mayor in 2006, says his town has been more restrictive than others along the Oregon coast.
"People saw neighbourhoods becoming commercial zones," says Mr. Williams, who has lived in Cannon Beach since 1972. "We've reached a good compromise: We haven't banned short-term rentals, but we've limited them."
In all, just over a hundred properties in town are officially designated for unrestricted short-term rentals; if any of those are sold, those rights are rotated among existing homeowners. Anyone buying a house today is restricted to one rental of any length every 14 days, says Tami Florer of Cannon Beach Property Management.
Along with the Coaster Theater and the art galleries, Cannon Beach has a gourmet cooking school and a summer music-study program offered by an extension campus of Portland State University. The effect is sort of Ivy League-by-the-shore, with matching prices.
Oceanfront homes routinely sell for well more than $1-million, if you can find one that's available: Real estate agent Duane Johnson says no oceanfront home was offered for sale in 2007. Even homes off the beach carry a hefty price tag. Condominiums are available in the $350,000-to-$500,000 range, many within walking distance of the pounding surf.
Like many recent retirees, Doug and Judy Wood relied on a fortunate family connection to come here. The Michigan couple's oldest daughter attended the University of Oregon and moved to Cannon Beach after graduation. She had friends who were aware of a piece of property for sale in 2002, one much too expensive for them to buy alone. Instead, this couple and the Woods agreed to buy the property and split it into two half-acre parcels that each could afford.
After netting about $425,000 on the sale of their home in suburban Detroit, the Woods built a two-storey house from plans of a Cape Cod-style retreat they had seen outside Seattle. Buying a similar house in Cannon Beach in 2002 would have cost more than $600,000, Mr. Wood says. Today that same house would be worth about $850,000.
"Compared with what we sold for in Michigan," says Mr. Wood, 69, "it would have been a real stretch to buy this house."
With Portland so close, Cannon Beach residents have easy access to one of the nation's most elegant cities, where they can find premier museums and restaurants and the National Basketball Association's Trail Blazers, among other attractions.
But locals gripe that the trip - which takes about an hour and a half by car or bus - is a drag when it's done out of necessity, as it frequently is for shopping or medical care.
A bus line with a single daily run connects Cannon Beach to Portland's Amtrak station and airport. Another option is Partners for Seniors, a motor pool of mostly retired Cannon Beach residents who serve as drivers for other retirees.
Many retirees here say they cut down on shuttling back and forth by keeping a second residence in Portland, either an apartment or condominium, or perhaps a spare room at a family member's home.

Full text: Long-time cottagers have tolerated the invasion of monster homes, golf courses, float planes and power boats, but skyrocketing property value assessments are proving to be the tipping point
Just over 40 years ago, a struggling young artist named Ed Bartram found his muse: a 10-acre slab of granite and pine off Georgian Bay's serrated shore.
The island was deserted but for the concrete forms of an old cottage leaching slowly into the soil.
He had to have it.
Mr. Bartram offered the owner $7,800, every penny he'd saved teaching high school to supplement his painting income.
"I didn't buy it with the idea of making a profit," said Mr. Bartram, now 70. "I fell in love with the area."
Since then, Mr. Bartram and his work have become so rooted in the island and its surroundings that locals named the island after him. But now the renowned painter of Georgian Bay rockscapes is worried that skyrocketing property taxes on waterfront cottages may force him to part with his Bartram Island and the spartan cottage studio he built upon it for $400.
"My whole art career is associated with that property," he said.
Over the past three years, values of waterfront cottages in Ontario have ballooned by as much as 150 per cent, according to one recent report compiled by real-estate firm Cushman & Wakefield LePage. Until now, a two-year freeze on the annual property assessment cycle has insulated property owners from corresponding tax bills.
The freeze thaws this fall, when the provincial government will issue a new round of tax bills.
Waterfront cottage owners are already saving up or cashing out.
"People don't like to talk about it all that much, but taxes are already playing a significant factor in people's decision to sell," said Bob Topp, executive director of Waterfront Ratepayers After Fair Taxation, a retiree who saw his cottage taxes increase 65 per cent during the last round of assessments in 2005.
"People are looking at their bills and saying, 'We're out of here.' Either they can't afford it or they don't think their kids will be able to."
Retiree Jane Stock and her husband were willing to tolerate the monster homes, golf courses, float planes and power boats that moved in around their Lake Joseph cottage over the past decade; it was the tax bill that finally drove them out.
"We had many, many happy summers there," said the 80-year-old Sarnia, Ont., resident. "But when two lots near us went for over a million dollars, all of a sudden our taxes went to just under $8,000."
"We worked it out and we were paying at least $85 in taxes for every day we used the place. It just got to be too much."
Ms. Stock said she appealed to her local municipality for help, to no avail.
Several ratepayers' groups expect the ranks of dispossessed cottagers to swell this fall. The median resale price for waterfront cottages in the Muskoka and Haliburton regions increased by 47 per cent from 2004 to 2007, according to a report by Cushman & Wakefield LePage. That compares with an 18 per cent climb for non-waterfront residential properties in the area.
"This means I'm going to pick up a bigger tax bill and the beneficiary is the guy who's not on the water," said Mr. Topp.
That's a reasonable state of affairs, according to the province's municipal property tax authority.
"There's a limited number of waterfront properties, so the values go up faster than other property types in times of strong demand," said Larry Hummel, vice president of property values with the Municipal Property Assessment Corporation. "It's purely economics and circumstance."
Tax assessments don't necessarily follow property values. MPAC looked at a number of factors in assessing properties, including lot dimensions, building quality, recent renovations and sales data.
But Mr. Topp wants the provincial government to moderate the roller-coaster nature of cottage assessments by instituting a 5-per-cent cap on year-to-year tax increases. He'd also like to see Ontario adopt American programs that link property-value assessment to personal income and offer special assistance to pensioners.
The provincial government has acted on some demands to reform its assessment methods. Starting this year, properties will be reassessed every four years - replacing the current annual assessment cycle - and any increase will be phased in gradually over that period.
A property owner hit with a 50 per cent assessment increase, for instance, would see 12.5 per cent added to each of his or her subsequent four tax bills.
"That's still too much for a person on a fixed income," said Mr. Topp.
And it may spell the end of one of the country's most fruitful artistic relationships between a breathtaking landscape and one of its definitive interpreters.
Several smaller islands near Bartram Island have recently fetched in excess of $1-million.
"I live in fear that my assessment will quadruple," Mr. Bartram said. "That may force me out."

A new bridge can never go too far

Full text:   Infrastructure investment not only fixes a local headache but affects development, as a Kelowna project shows
When the William R. Bennett bridge in Kelowna, B.C., officially opens in two weeks, Robert Fine's big band will help entertain at an all-day party capped off with fireworks on the banks of the Okanagan River.
There will be reason to celebrate: The new, five-lane structure is expected to ease traffic snarls around the old bridge, which now handles a much larger number of vehicles than when it opened 50 years ago. And it will better connect the more populous east side where Kelowna's city centre is located with the appropriately named Westbank, where future growth lies.
Indeed, long before the hoopla planned for May 25, anticipation of the new bridge's impact on the Kelowna region has spurred residential and commercial real estate development, said Mr. Fine, who is executive director of central Okanagan region's Economic Development Commission (EDC) when he's not singing in his band.
The Bennett bridge is an example of how investing in infrastructure not only can ease an acute, local issue, but can influence development patterns and expectations. And infrastructure is expected to become a front-burner issue in the coming years as governments consider what to do about aging or outdated roads, bridges, sewers and the like across the country.
Kelowna's beauty and growing wealth has become a draw for people from larger centres, such as Vancouver. The Regional District of the Central Okanagan, which includes Kelowna, is expected to become home to 220,000 people by 2020, up from 111,846 in 1991, according to EDC's website.
Studies by EDC a few years ago had anticipated a need for one million additional square feet of retail development to meet demand from the growing population. But businesses had serious concerns that Westbank, which has the most available development land, could be snubbed by people because of the traffic problems associated with the old bridge.
"There were certainly a number of both commercial and residential developers hovering around the west side going: 'Should we or shouldn't we?' They were saying: 'I'm not sure if we want to go over there, is it viable?' " Mr. Fine said.
Then things took a dramatic turn in the summer of 2005 when the province announced that Montreal-based SNC-Lavalin Group Inc. had been chosen to design, build, finance and operate the new $144.5-million floating bridge.
It was the green light for a flood of development in Westbank, which now boasts major retailers, such as Home Depot and Canadian Tire, with more coming soon, Mr. Fine said.
As the official opening draw nears, the bridge is a tangible example of the competitive advantages of transportation infrastructure renewal in Canada - the theme of a conference this evening in Toronto organized by the Urban Land Institute.
"Infrastructure fuels economies and enables prosperity," according to a recent report by the Urban Land Institute (ULI) and Ernst & Young. "In fact, only countries that manage to invest heavily in infrastructure have attained and can sustain global leadership."
The report characterizes the economies of Canada, the U.S. and Australia as "coasting on prosperity" when it comes to investing in infrastructure. It adds that, in Canada, road systems built in the 1960s and 1970s, are now showing signs of wear and that, over all, $240-billion will be needed for maintenance and upgrades to infrastructure to meet expected population growth.
In Ontario, infrastructure improvement is a key in the government's five-point plan to deal with the challenges posed by a weakening economy, said David Caplan, Minister of Public Infrastructure Renewal.
"We've been sprawling across a great land mass in the province of Ontario, but if we use our investments in transit much more strategically and effectively, we can channel the growth to the places where we can handle it a lot better," he said in an interview last week.
Some current areas of focus include helping the City of Ottawa with systems to handle its growth and development, better transit to aid with the urban revitalization in the Region of Waterloo, and addressing congestion in the Golden Horseshoe area.
The "wonderful, twofold benefits" to investing in transportation, Mr. Caplan said, is that it gets people working right away, while laying the foundation for moving goods and people over the long term. Ontario is focused on improving other types of infrastructure, including health care and water systems, he said.
One of the biggest stumbling blocks to undertaking such projects is the time it takes to get everything in place, including land acquisitions, consultations and environmental assessments, said Mr. Caplan, who will speak at the ULI conference this evening. For this reason, the government has capped environmental assessments for transportation projects at six months, which he said is enough time to get the work done.
Another major obstacle to improving infrastructure is the steep cost of these projects, particularly at a time when the economies of many developed countries are slowing.
"Infrastructure investment is an acute need worldwide, but finding a way to fund projects is a major challenge," according to the ULI/E & Y report. "Facing weakness in the economy and escalating constructing costs, the funding of new infrastructure projects may be met increasingly by public-private partnerships."
Public-private partnerships, or P3s, have become a popular method of financing. They can assume a variety of different structures, and involve investors ranging from pension funds to private equity firms.
Transportation is particularly well suited to the P3 model, said Jane Peatch, executive director of the Canadian Council for Public-Private Partnerships. It also appears to be the segment of infrastructure that provides the biggest return on investment for the "limited dollars" available in Canada, she added.
One of the best examples of a transportation project success is the Confederation Bridge, which links Prince Edward Island to mainland New Brunswick and recently marked its 10th anniversary, Ms. Peatch said.
"It would be really hard to knock that project. It has stood the test of time," she said of the bridge, which includes a number of private sector shareholders, including a unit of the Ontario Municipal Employees Retirement System.
However, concerns are being raised around the world about whether P3s could allow investors to gain control of a country's strategic assets - and whether the political backlash could put a chill on much needed investment.
Canada hasn't been immune from this. Last month, the New Zealand government blocked the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board from making a minority investment in Auckland International Airport Ltd., after expressing worries about losing control of its strategic land assets.

News Corp. drops out as Cablevision moves on Newsday

https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/news-corp-drops-out-as-cablevision-moves-on/docview/382720262/se-2?accountid=14656

Abstract: While a Newsday deal will ease Tribune's debt load, the company will lose an important asset. The daily and its related businesses had nearly $500-million in revenue last year, about 10 per cent of Tribune's revenue, according to the company's annual report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

Full text:   Tribune Co. is at the brink of a deal to sell its Long Island newspaper Newsday to Cablevision Systems Corp. for $650-million (U.S.), according to a person familiar with the situation, in a deal to that will help relieve Tribune's debt.
If successful, the bid from the Long Island-based cable operator will have bested matching $580-million offers from News Corp., which owns the New York Post and The Wall Street Journal, and New York Daily News owner Mortimer Zuckerman. News Corp. had had an informal agreement for Newsday, but was unwilling to match Cablevision's offer and revoked its bid on Saturday.
Clinching the deal would put the Long Island cable operator in control of Newsday and related assets, including the free New York City newspaper amNew York. The deal, which is expected to be structured as a joint venture for tax reasons, would leave Tribune with a small stake in Newsday.
Although some reports in recent days had said Cablevision's offer actually was valued at somewhat less than it appeared because it included Newsday real estate while the other two didn't, the current deal doesn't include real estate, either, said a person familiar with its terms.
Newsday's sale reflects the troubles of the newspaper industry. Sam Zell, who led an $8.2-billion buyout of Tribune in December, had said he hadn't wanted to sell any of the major papers. But conditions worsened. However, the deal also shows how certain local buyers see strategic value in individual newspapers.
The transaction will help Tribune dent nearly $13-billion of debt largely stemming from a December deal to go private. Tribune owes about $650-million in debt repayment before the end of this year. The company also faces rising interest expenses - $263-million in the first quarter alone.
With advertising declining quickly at Tribune's newspapers, the company may face pressure to unload other properties to meet debt and interest payments next year. It owns papers including the Los Angeles Times and the Chicago Tribune, and television stations. It is selling its Chicago Cubs baseball team.
While a Newsday deal will ease Tribune's debt load, the company will lose an important asset. The daily and its related businesses had nearly $500-million in revenue last year, about 10 per cent of Tribune's revenue, according to the company's annual report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
For Cablevision, the Newsday acquisition provides an outlet to cross-sell advertising and to promote its own services and properties in the New York area. As the company's cable, telephone and Internet offerings face competition from Verizon Communications Inc., Cablevision seems to be to doubling its local focus in an effort to retain customers. Last week, the company announced it would spend more than $300-million to build out a local wireless service.
Still, Cablevision has faced skepticism about its pursuit of Newsday. Some analysts have argued it would be better for shareholders if Cablevision were to return the cash it generates in the form of stock buybacks.
The Newsday deal could mean changes in the New York media world. With the inclusion of Newsday, News Corp. could have improved the financial performance of the New York Post, which was expected to combine advertising, printing and other functions with Newsday. Now the Post is expected to be more aggressive in cutting costs and finding new revenue streams.

Full text:   Media watcher Rick Salutin makes a pilgrimage to the Newseum, Washington's highly touted, $450-million temple to journalism, and finds it entertaining but also full of distractions - much like the media it enshrines
If you're a bit obsessed with news, as many of us are - or have even written a column, largely on the news media, as I have - then it's a privilege to wander through the recently opened Newseum, in Washington, D.C., trying to figure out what that obsession is really about. Museums (and newseums) help you think, by highlighting their subject matter and putting it on display. It doesn't have to be old and exotic, like mummies.
The Newseum, sponsored mainly by news organizations, occupies the last major frontage on Pennsylvania Avenue, just down from the Capitol and right beside (abutting, as real-estate agents say) the Canadian embassy. The façade is covered with six floors' worth of the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment, the one about free speech and a free press, written (literally) in stone, bold and black.
That's the D.C. style: utterly monumental. Originally, a local journalist says, the amendment was sandblasted into the wall, but that was deemed too understated, so it was overlaid by the imposing letters.
Other cultures may do their newseums differently. Free speech, Gandhi could have said: It would be a good idea. Toronto's Honest Ed, who covered his garish bargain house with signs, might have posted: Don't just stand there, mythologize something!
In fact, there's lots Canadian in the Newseum. It draws on satires of news like Saturday Night Live that reflect the influence of a Canadian sense of familiarity yet distance toward U.S. culture. It has splendid displays on the rise of print - a topic brilliantly explored by Canadian historian Harold Innis, who was one of the founders of modern media theory, and by his (IMHO) lesser successor, Marshall McLuhan.
A Toronto firm, Kubik, even built the countless Newseum displays. Kubik's Sam Kohn explains that three modules make up the building: The first looks out on Penn Avenue. The two behind it fold into each other like pages in a newspaper. Once he points this out, it really feels that way. I'm inside a newspaper, writing about the news, for a newspaper. Weird.
A filmed "orientation" starts with the most godlike voice of my youth: Walter Cronkite. "The world comes to you. We call it the news." Well, that's totally murky. Another voice says, "War is news" - though only some wars are. "Peace is news ... Life is news ... Death is news ... Hate is news." The only thing that's clear so far is they haven't given us a clue what news is. Maybe we're supposed to know it when we see it. That's okay. Definitions are overrated. The displays proper start on the top floor and work on down.
There's some creaky "early history" of news, "from smoke signals to sagas." Homeric epics, yeah, right. "Arrival of language" in 100,000 BC. This kind of fluff is now common in museums. Over at the International Spy Museum, they include Moses sending spies into the Holy Land.
But it gets better. There's a real page from a Gutenberg Bible, which takes my breath away, and then, a level below, a model of an early printing press. Now, it seems to me, we're really talking about the Birth of the News.
The battle between
oral and written
I've been obsessed with the role of print since I first read Mr. Innis's thoughts on the crucial divide between the oral and written traditions. For millennia, he says, civilizations teetered productively between the two very different ways of exploring reality - a little of this, a little of that - but with the invention of the printing press, the balance swung decisively toward the written and has never been restored.
I've devoured books about this, taught courses on it, written of it (probably far too often) when I had a media column in The Globe and Mail, and even pondered my choice to become a writer in its light. But nothing ever clarified for me the power and nature of print like the displays in the cavernous "history of news" gallery at the Newseum.
A timeline runs the full length of one module and doubles back up the other side, from Gutenberg's first press in 1450 through to the present. Beneath the timeline, on sliding glass trays stacked three high, are examples of news sheets, news books, newspapers, circulars - mostly American from centuries past. They weren't just sold, they were posted in public places, laid out in coffee houses.
Why this stress on "news" back in print's early days? Well, how were printers going to justify their heavy fixed investment in printing presses once they had published the Bible and a few other classical texts? There were relatively few books left, it took time to generate new ones, including "novels," reading was still difficult for most people, and journals (as in journalism) was a clever solution. They had handy content: the events of the day and thoughts about those events. They weren't written for "the public." Rather, they created a public for the first time. Before that, there were elites, at the court, and mobs, which came and went sporadically. But printed material gave the public a continuity, and a subject to focus on - the "news" about matters that affected them, and which they could in turn affect, i.e., through mass politics. By 1814 with steam presses, The Times of London could print 1,100 copies an hour. Before print, there were no journalists; ever since, they've been "the press."
So, in a way, journalism created politics in the modern sense as well as creating the public: Through it, a newly aware, interested public became a player, alongside the court or the mob. You can sense the excitement about this new element of influence when John Adams, America's second president and some-time journalist (with his own HBO series this year), wrote: "It is curious employment cooking up paragraphs, articles, occurrences and working the political engine." Like a new kitchen device, a stove or Cuisinart, but historically potent. You could use it to break free of an empire, or abolish slavery. Without it, how would you have mounted campaigns against entrenched power like the British monarchy or the Southern landed aristocracy?
If you then ensconce that power and protect it - through declaring it a sacrosanct right, like freedom of religion - you've made yourself and your political projects hard to undermine or even criticize. Freedom of the press amounts to about the same thing as power of the press. This kind of journalism was politics. It wasn't about information, it was about opinion and action: creating a public to act on things in a desired direction.
Nothing has ever given me so full a sense of the force in that early moment of print and the way it transformed the world as those pullout drawers. When you read about early journals and papers in history texts, they're just examples in a book. The book looms over them. It can't make the moment present like these actual oversized artifacts, which predate most books. It's the perfect use of a museum.
But then what about information, which we associate so strongly with news? Where does that come in? The orientation film says, "Information is where liberty starts." Al Neuharth, founder of the Freedom Forum, the foundation that created and runs Newseum, says (right on the wall) that visitors will come as tourists but leave as better-informed citizens. It's the premise of the place and of most journalism. And yet, just as the exhibits on early print give a real insight into that topic, the rest of the displays of news seem to underline its oddly uninformative quality.
Sex, crime, scandal
- embed or in bed?
Everything whizzes by so swiftly and disconnectedly, as you follow the "flow" from level to level. There's a reference to public broadcasting, a display case on "Sex, crime, scandal" with a copy of Weekly World News (R.I.P.). Another called "Embed or in bed?" about reporters' relationship with the military in war zones. The dilemma isn't concealed, but there's no space or means to ponder it either. There's an "ethics table" where you can dabble in quandaries about anonymous sources and doctored photos. Here's a display on women in the news, one on ownership, press barons, "Mergers and takeovers create multimedia giants ..."
Whoa, that could be worth a linger. It may be the key component in modern media: corporate control. But it whips past exactly like clips from The Colbert Report or Ali versus Foreman and Matt Drudge. Nothing is suppressed, but there's no integration into any overall sense-making process. In fact, it's exactly the same kind of jumble you find on the pages of any newspaper, which may not disorient or bother us but only because we're so used to it. Here in the Newseum - and I consider this a good thing - that chaotic disconnectedness stands out in a way it doesn't in the paper or on a newscast - everything is displayed in a case. But how can you contemplate the news the way you can a statuette from Crete or a suit of medieval armour for a while and then move on? Surely the news should be more urgent, present and connected to us. This is the kind of experience that makes you think about something you took for granted.
My man Innis understood this sporadic, disconnected character of news. He said it came with the nature of print, what he called its bias. Print is good for snippets of info, he argued, but bad for inquiring in depth into "the subject matter of human action and feeling"- like ethics, politics or religion. The laborious oral tradition was better in those areas, he grumbled.
By oral, he didn't mean radio or TV. He meant face-to-face live discourse on serious issues, as used to happened in ancient Athens, or the Talmudic academies or the Iroquois confederacy. Depersonalized in print, disconnected from living human interaction and response, such issues were doomed to devolve into sensationalism, on haughtier or grottier levels, from presidential politics to movie stars, everything trivialized and fragmented, that was print's destiny along with its broadcast offspring.
I don't mean the Newseum isn't fun. It is, in a madcap, newsy way. The kids seem delighted by a display of old newsreels that announce "the coming of TV." Imagine, a time when TV wasn't already here. They love the sonorous voiceover, the thundering music and the closing shot of the world spinning. "I knew they'd do that," they say.
And it's beautifully done. There's a feeling of openness throughout the building as you tramp the ramps, the sun streaming through the windows of module one, like the openness of the free press itself (at least in the mythic version). The endless displays may overwhelm but they don't abuse or assault you; it's more like being tickled and overstimulated. The music is bouncy, there's goofy alongside morbid, a traffic helicopter hovers above the atrium. In the end, nothing really penetrates, as if that's the nature of news too: to shut you off from yourself and focus you outward, on stuff, on the world. It's slick and feel-good, like most American culture, like Hollywood films, even those with "serious" themes: war, for instance, or disease.
So you get Vietnam, with the horrific visuals but it's still a feel-good story because, after all, the press broke through to the truth and the whole nightmare ended, so you don't really have to reflect on why it happened or how it's happening again in other places like Iraq or Afghanistan. And eventually there's 9/11, which you cover to exhaustion but don't really contemplate; instead, put up a 9/11 gallery in the Newseum and celebrate it in a sombre, ceremonial way. Commemoration replaces contemplation making further disasters and galleries in their honour probable.
Better informed makes
us better citizens?
Mr. Neuharth wants the tourists to leave as better-informed citizens. Well, they may be better informed. But that doesn't necessarily make them better citizens. What does a citizen need? Not endless information but space and time in which to contemplate the information they have and formulate a response. That may not be journalism's responsibility, maybe its task is the inform component. But in a place like Newseum, and in journalism generally, there's so much information that it's almost impossible for citizens to reflect, and rarely a hint of a hint that they ought to. The sheer bulk of information tends to render them mute and vulnerable. There are times when less (informed) may be better.
What the museum-ish atmosphere of Newseum lets you do is ponder these problematic aspects of news and information. The experience suggests that news isn't just information, it's also distraction. I'm not saying it's intentional. It doesn't really matter, that's the result. News sucks you in because you care about things like politics, history and social justice; then news distracts you by yammering about them so divertingly that you can easily forget about dealing with them. And what a clever way to distract you from the world and the parts of it that affect you fatefully: with tales and images from the world itself. The way news distracts people from thinking about the information they've just been given is by giving them more. There's always more, as there is in the Newseum, where signs say: "Attention, news junkies" - and then direct you to the shops. Being there really is like wandering around a colossal newspaper.
Then, next morning back at the hotel, USA Today is outside the door, with Harrison Ford and Sarah Jessica Parker and a footballer pointing in your face, along with "Iraqi forces lacking" and "Video games under fire." It's not that some of it is trite and some heavy; it's that absence of opportunity to reflect. Is it a surprise that Al Neuharth also created USA Today, whose owner, Gannett Corporation, is Newseum's big funder?
There is one section of the Newseum, where Pulitzer Prize-winning photos are displayed, that does clear a little space for contemplation. A Buddhist moment. Maybe it's because they're stills, in black and white. "Lost Child" - a couple stares forlornly from the beach into the brutal ocean. "Fatal Fire" - a fire fighter holds a dead kid. There's no real push to move on from these, they invite consideration and stillness. Maybe it's just because they're tucked into an odd, unadorned corner of the place, out of the relentless flow.
What if the Newseum gave you that kind of space to contemplate all its busy doings? Then it wouldn't be the Newseum, it would be the News and Space museum (to go with the Air and Space museum over on the mall, ho-ho). What about strategically placed alcoves, halting the flow, where you could sit and think about what you just saw, judge and absorb it? Maybe after the news on TV, there should be a mandatory period of silence and blank screen so people can think about what's going on. And papers should have empty pages inviting you to ponder what you read, or scribble your own responses.
I don't think more analysis or opinion are required along with the "straight" news. There's already plenty of that in the press and I don't believe it assists citizenship in the way the Newseum says it wants to do. Mr. Innis would have said journalism and the print tradition are democracy's enemies because democracy (in the classical, Greek sense) requires the oral process, with its slowness, complexity and human interaction. That's where citizenship takes root, not by imbibing vast gobs of information.
Papers defined news
but won't outlive it
We live at a time when newspapers are panicky, if not about their actual extinction then at least about maintaining their previously normal, abnormal levels of profit. So it's a suitably anxious time to embalm the species in a mausoleum. But news will also persist, with or without the papers, which long ago set the parameters for any versions of it to come in the future. Either way, it seems like an apt time for a Newseum.

WHAT: A newly built home in Lawrence Park, complete with professionally designed interiors
LIVING SPACE: more than 4,800 square feet
LOT SIZE: 65 by 135 feet
ASKING PRICE: $4,895,000
TAXES: not yet assessed
AGENT: Sam Tassone, Royal LePage West Realty Group Ltd.
In upscale neighbourhoods such as Lawrence Park and Forest Hill, it's more common than it used to be for builders to complete infill homes right down to the decor without having a buyer, according to real estate agent Sam Tassone.
One of those builders is Tony DeCaria, principal of Gallery Homes, who is just putting the finishing touches to this more than 4,800-square-foot residence on Stratheden Road in Lawrence Park. The house, listed by Mr. Tassone, will go on the market in mid-May.
Mr. DeCaria says he incorporated elements in the dwelling that previous clients have most requested - everything from a mix of formal and open-concept layouts to theatre seating in a lower level media room.
"You drive to the community, see what's going on in the area, and try to site a building that will complement not what's old, but what is evolving," Mr. DeCaria adds. "Because we're building in these areas - and have been for at least 10 years - we see what the improvements are.
Mr. DeCaria, who continues a family tradition of building that began when his grandfather arrived at Ellis Island from Italy in 1909, has about 800 homes in his portfolio, including several luxury homes for prestigious clients.
On a job a few years ago - a $3.29-million property in Forest Hill for a former Toronto Maple Leafs goaltender (which sold about two years later to an award-winning Canadian musician for $4.2-million) - he met interior designer Halina Catherine.
She has dressed about 10 residences done by Gallery Homes since then, including this one.
Mr. DeCaria says he always approaches locals for feedback on his plans.
"We've got to take their thoughts into consideration ... but we don't always come to an agreement."
At 41 Stratheden Rd., there was some opposition to the house's size, he says, though it takes up only about a third of the 65- by 135-foot lot.
Most new homes cover about 65 per cent of the property, more than twice what was traditionally permitted, he points out.
"We built to what the city will allow."
This home, like many Mr. DeCaria has built, has a limestone facade with a cedar shake roof, frieze-board details, as well as solider coursings above arched windows. For variety, there also are round and oval windows.
Inside, the eat-in kitchen in the rear opens to the family room. "The kids are playing and chatting while you're cooking, so it's a nice family environment," Ms. Catherine says.
Upstairs, a large master retreat along the back of the house includes a dressing room and an ensuite bathroom that rivals the size of the other bedrooms.
The basement, which adds another 2,740 square feet to the living space, features a 20-seat theatre, kitchenette, spa and gym - all high-demand features these days, according to Ms. Catherine.
"[People] want the privacy of an in-home gym and being able to wake up and have a personal trainer coming to the home," she explains. "Because of [limited] time, people are needing more luxuries at home."
Another example of this is the home's covered terrace with a wood-burning fireplace. "People want to relax in the summer night outside and have a fire going," Mr. DeCaria says. "It feels like they're at the cottage."
Because people are entertaining more at home, the design incorporates a music room between the spacious living and dining rooms, as well as a sunken wine cellar on the lower level.
Ms. Catherine picked out everything from furniture and artwork to window treatments and lighting.
Black and white Carrera marble tiles with a traditional pattern were chosen for the foyer, and quarter-sawn white oak flooring with an intricate herringbone pattern for the kitchen and family room.
Seen throughout the house is elaborate millwork - custom trims, ceiling mouldings and full-height panelling on the main floor and upper hall, and dark-stained, cherry panelling in the library.
To maximize the decor's appeal, Ms. Catherine kept her designs "simple and clean," but she pairs antique pieces with modern ones or combines traditional and art deco elements. For instance, the living room features art deco chairs paired with a traditional sofa and cocktail table, along with black crystal art deco lamps on a traditional sofa back console.
In the dining room, traditional upholstered seats are placed at a simple art deco dining table. Above the table is a traditional tiered Georgian crystal chandelier with quartz accents, creating a simple yet formal look.
"You don't want something coming in and out of fashion," Ms. Catherine says. "If you can put a twist on things to give it current feel, but stay traditional, it's timeless really."
If a buyer wants to make any changes, Mr. DeCaria will do so after the sale.
Mr. Tassone adds: "For the price point we're going to list it at - with all the craftsmanship and quality of workmanship that is involved - it's a bargain compared to other homes on the market."
The amenities
This two-storey stone house contains four bedrooms, seven bathrooms and five custom-crafted fireplaces with marble surrounds.
Ceilings are 10 feet on the main floor, where there is a library, piano room, dining room, and a living room with one of four gas fireplaces.
A family room is located off the eat-in kitchen, which includes luxury appliances, a walk-in pantry and island. It opens to a covered terrace with a stone fireplace.
The built-in double garage has direct access to a mud/laundry room.
Upstairs, there are three bedrooms with private bathrooms and walk-in closets. The master bedroom has a fireplace, dressing room and an ensuite with twin sinks, glass shower stall and freestanding tub.
In the basement, there is a recreation room with a two-way fireplace shared with a gym, as well as a spa with a sauna and steam shower. Rounding out this level is a sunken wine cellar, kitchenette, theatre and a nanny suite with a bathroom, plus an exit to the backyard.
The landscaping will be finished in June. Elements include fencing, deciduous hedges and side gates to a south-facing backyard with a terraced garden.
The driveway is radiant heated.

Full text:   Garden Homes has launched a development of large, luxury homes in Newmarket that the builder says will be the most prestigious master-planned community in town.
Called the Pride of Stonehaven, it will consist of 97 semi-detached houses and single-family residences on 36-, 50- and 55 feet lots at Mulock Drive and Leslie Street, about 30 minutes north of Toronto.
Treed streets will be lined with bungalows and two-storey houses, including some beside or backing on to a forested ravine.
There will be a variety of brick, stone and stucco exteriors available, with garages, porticos and multiple window styles, including round and Palladian.
The homes will have three- and four-bedroom designs with open concept layouts on the main floor.
Various plans will contain dens, combined or separate living and dining rooms, and eat-in kitchens that open to rear family rooms.
Laundry rooms will be situated on the main or second floors.
Architectural details include coffered and cathedral ceilings, decorative columns on half-walls and art niches.
Green features will be incorporated throughout to meet Energy Star standards. Low-E argon windows and increased insulation in areas such as walls and attics are expected to make the homes less drafty, and reduce utility bills. These houses will be 30 per cent more energy-efficient than conventional ones, according to the builder.
To commemorate 25 years in business, the builder has made updated features such as granite countertops with undermounted sinks, plaster cornice moulding in combined living and dining room and oak hardwood floors on the main floor standard in detached models.
Similarly, in semi-detached plans, five appliances, a gas fireplace with a marble surround or laminate flooring on the main level will be considered standard.
In addition, purchasers will get up to $7,000 in bonus upgrades.
Move-ins are expected to start in December.
Visitors to the site will find an established area, with schools, parks and local theatre.
Continuing development, however, has brought new amenities to the community, including the Magna Centre, which houses an Olympic-sized and three NHL-sized ice rinks, an aquatic centre and a gym.
It is a quick drive from the site to the historic downtown centre, big-box stores and malls in the Yonge Street and Davis Drive area, a GO Train station and Highway 404.

Full text:   Bremont Homes has completely finished an infill project in a wooded setting in Maple and is offering buyers closing times of between 60 days and four months.
The collection of 19 luxury freehold townhouses, called Dreamwood, is selling quickly, however. About 75 per cent have already been snatched up.
Located off Keele Street, north of Major Mackenzie Drive, the development has three decorated model homes that show the available floor plans, but potential buyers can tour any unit prior to purchasing one.
Units either face or back on to ponds, and they are situated along a private court so there is no through traffic.
Building with only four to six units feature brick facades with extra-large windows, as well as garages, double-door entrances, and, in some cases, covered balconies.
The open-concept layouts contain great rooms adjoining eat-in kitchens. Larger end units have central dining areas with three-sided fireplaces shared with a family room.Upstairs, there are laundry rooms with extra-tall cabinetry, as well as the bedrooms, including master suites with walk-in closets and private bathrooms.
Cold cellars and roughed-in three-piece bathrooms are included in the basement. Selected units have walkouts.
There are nine-foot ceilings and pot lights on the main floor, electric fireplaces, and natural oak staircases. Flooring materials include ceramic tile and 35-ounce carpeting.
The builder has installed upgraded features in many units - in some cases up to $30,000 worth, including such things as hardwood flooring in the principal rooms, appliances and wrought-iron railings.
There will be a monthly condo fee of $125 to cover snow removal and street maintenance, but it will be waived for the first two years as a bonus.
Local amenities include shops and services at Vaughan Mills, a Colossus multiplex theatre and Canada's Wonderland. The site is also close to schools, golf courses and highways 400 and 407.

Look west for higher-end higher density

Abstract: Oakville, however, is where you'll find the highest concentration of luxury high-rise and townhouse developments in Greater Toronto, on a per-capita basis. It's also where you'll find condominium products far beyond your average suite, such as at Memoirs, currently under construction by Moldenhauer Lifestyles.

Full text:   Halton Region is often overlooked by the broad base of condominium buyers and doesn't grab the attention of high-density market gurus focused on Greater Toronto.
Burlington and Oakville can largely claim to have delivered nicely on the great suburban promise of the 1960s and 70s: tight-knit, affluent communities with good schools and plenty of recreational amenities nearby, mostly oriented around the Lake Ontario shore. Most importantly, they have remained free of the big-city hassles of traffic and overcrowding. While that's the Chamber of Commerce line, there's a considerably high degree of satisfaction and civic pride among current Burlingtonians and Oakvillians, and no shortage of low-rise buyers who view the two cities on the western frontier of Greater Toronto as their first choice in terms of desired location.
Add to this highway access and GO Train service to and from Toronto and Hamilton. Though not entirely free of highway congestion along the Queen Elizabeth Way, Oakville and Burlington are seamlessly hooked into the alternative toll road Highway 407 in a way that its equivalent bedroom communities on the east side of Greater Toronto - Whitby and Oshawa - simply aren't.
The new housing market has shifted away from low-rise tract housing toward more high-density development over the past two years, spurred on by the increasing number of residents who are downsizing from their current low-rise homes and affluent single professionals with an affinity for a more easy-going lifestyle on the lakeshore.
There's also hardly any vacant land that can reasonably be expected to accommodate the tract low-rise development. Those appear to have gravitated north toward the once small but now sprawling Milton. There are some high-density developments aimed at first-time home buyers looking for affordability, but this is more of a niche market in Halton Region as opposed to the core of the market in central Toronto. Condominium and townhouse developments here are unique for tilting toward the high end of the market.
On the affordable side of the market is The Mosaic by veteran Halton Region developer Branthaven Homes. The Mosaic consist of 98 townhouses, including 16 live-work units, ranging in price from $250,000 for 1,069 square feet to $470,000 for 2,181 square feet. Located on Plains Road on Burlington's west end, Mosaic is one of several Burlington-area high-density projects that feature a live-work component with an open area on the ground floor for a small business and a living area upstairs.
On the high end of the Burlington market for new high-density dwellings is Freure Homes's Brant's Landing East, an eight-storey tower recently completed with 43 suites.
Prices here start at $712,000 for 1,442 square feet and go up to $1.033-million for 1,830 square feet, all on a prominent lakeshore perch just west of Burloak Drive. There are still more than a dozen suites for sale here, with sales that can be closed in as little as 60 days.
Oakville, however, is where you'll find the highest concentration of luxury high-rise and townhouse developments in Greater Toronto, on a per-capita basis. It's also where you'll find condominium products far beyond your average suite, such as at Memoirs, currently under construction by Moldenhauer Lifestyles. On sale here are two-storey detached homes along the lakeshore near attractive downtown Oakville, with common amenities that include access to a quarter-acre English garden, and maintenance fees covering all outdoor upkeep.
Prices range from $1.29-million to $1.59-million for up to 3,300 square feet, with the residences to be modelled after historic English garden homes built around the restored residence of Rev. George Washington.
The most sought-after new luxury project in Oakville is One Eleven Forsythe, a 12-storey condominium project perched along 16-Mile Creek currently under construction by The Daniels Corporation.
One Eleven Forsythe endured rancorous objections from local residents fearing height and a wave of condo development when it was initially unveiled, but since its approval and groundbreaking it's been a hit with buyers. About eight suites of a total of 68 remain for sale, ranging from $1.28-million to $2.105-million for between 1,700 and 2,300 square feet.

Full text:   Canada Post keeps Don Mills, Mimico, Weston alive, but Wexford, Leslieville and Baby Point don't fare as well...
Are there ghosts in the machines at Canada Post? More specifically, ghost towns or even ghost neighbourhoods?
About a year ago, I was sitting on the patio of the Wexford Restaurant at Lawrence and Warden avenues with Scarborough Historical Society member Jeremy Hopkin. He remarked that a letter addressed to a street in the area followed by "Wexford, Ontario" would arrive at its destination.
I'm not sure he meant that this was because the Wexford name has a long history - it was one of many "crossroads communities" that made up Scarborough township, and even had its own post office as of 1865 - or because you could cheat a little by adding the postal code, which would pretty much guarantee delivery.
Regardless, the conversation stayed with me, and I began to fixate on whether a letter would get to Wexford without a postal code. If it did, it would prove, in a romantic sort of way, that Wexford still existed as an independent place. If it didn't, well, although it wouldn't wipe it off the map, it would be kind of sad.
I wondered, too, about other places. How about towns that were swallowed up when Metropolitan Toronto was created in 1953, such as Mimico, Leaside, New Toronto or Weston? How about Don Mills, which although called a "new town" by its planner, Macklin Hancock, never was self-governed.
I decided to find out.
In a completely non-scientific experiment, I wrote letters - without including postal codes - to eight people I knew in some of those places to see if they'd arrive, be returned (and yes, I did put the postal code on the return address) or end up in postal limbo.
The pre-1953 town names were covered via people in Mimico, New Toronto and Weston. One went to a friend in Don Mills. My parents were my Wexford guinea pigs.
To make things interesting, I tried place names that I knew were long shots: Leslieville (Queen Street East between Carlaw and Coxwell), Baby Point (an area west of Jane Street, north of Bloor) and, to be really silly, "The Pocket" (a recent nickname for a little area south of Danforth Avenue, near Jones Avenue). I sent two batches of letters, changed slightly, to see if this would affect the outcome.
Before going further, I should mention that Monica Verma, a GTA spokeswoman for Canada Post, says that omitting postal codes is not advisable.
"We'd really like to promote proper addressing, proper postal code and proper postage," she says.
While it's a point taken, at 12:40 p.m. on March 17, I brought the first batch of eight "improper" letters to a postal outlet at Yonge and St. Clair.
These were business-sized envelopes addressed in 20-point Arial typeface. The return address was my name written by hand over my business address in small print. The second batch went to the same place at the same time two weeks later, on March 31, this time using smaller, invitation-sized envelopes addressed with a black ballpoint pen in my own hand approximating a 20-point size. The return address was my home address, also written by hand.
Had these letters had postal codes, Ms. Verma says, they would have whipped right through the "multiline optical character reader" at Canada Post's south-central letter-processing plant on Eastern Avenue and arrived at their intended destination within two business days.
Since they did not, they had their digital photograph taken "while still in the stream." These were "sent to the video encoding suite" where employees tried to make sense of the address. Any that were still undecipherable at that point would have then been "kicked out of the mechanized process" to be handled manually.
"Our employees will use local knowledge, information on the envelope and computer software to try and get an address," Ms. Verma explains.
For both batches, the flat-out winner was Don Mills. I got excited e-mails from my friend Paul Zanettos confirming delivery each time after just two days. As for those to Wexford, it took three weeks for the first letter to be returned to me after being sent to the Prescott, Ont., area ("K0E" was hand-written on it). The second came back after two weeks with the "address incomplete" box ticked.
Ms. Verma cautions, however, that this outcome was more a matter of the Don Mills name being familiar to Canada Post employees because of the large letter-carrier depot there. In other words, they were identified via their digital picture and not removed from the mechanized stream, hence the fast delivery.
Placing second were the two letters to my wife's friend Marion Traynor in New Toronto: The first arrived in just three business days, but the second took until April 9.
My co-worker Katherine Cott in Weston got her first letter in three days as well, but not the second. Similarly, another of my co-workers, Joe Middleton in Mimico, received the first letter, which took a whopping 29 days and had "try M8V" written on it (which is the correct beginning of his postal code), but he did not receive the second.
Like Wexford, both Baby Point and Leslieville were unknown to Canada Post (not at all surprising). Interestingly, while both Baby Point letters were returned, the Leslieville letters are either still bouncing around out there (and for that I apologize to Canada Post) or have come to their final resting place, the "undeliverable mail office" at 1680 Midland Ave. Here, one last-ditch attempt is made to get useful information to assist with delivery by physically opening the mail.
Most surprising of all was the e-mail I received on April 16 from my friend Mark Wigmore in "The Pocket": "Fun game!" he wrote, confirming he'd received my first letter the day before, 29 days after being sent.
"It actually doesn't surprise me," Ms. Verma says matter-of-factly. "We have very knowledgeable employees who really care about getting the mail out and they'll go to great lengths to make it happen."
So, with the autonomy of "The Pocket" validated by Canada Post, if residents ever decide they want custom street signs, streetlight banners or anything else to brand their neighbourhood, city officials will have no choice but to listen.
I wish I could say the same for Wexford.

Full text:   Vallejo, Calif., officials voted to file for bankruptcy late Tuesday night because the San Francisco suburb isn't able pay its bills after costs for police and firefighters soared and the housing market's slide cut into tax revenue.
The city council's unanimous decision will make Vallejo the largest California city to file for bankruptcy and the first in the state to seek protection from creditors because it ran out of money to pay for basic services. The decision came after it failed to win salary concessions from labour unions.
The city of 117,000 is facing ballooning labour costs and declining housing-related tax revenue that have left it with a $16-million (U.S.) deficit forecast for the year starting in July. In bankruptcy, creditors will be kept at bay while officials devise a plan to balance the books. City services would still operate.
"Nobody wants bankruptcy, but there doesn't appear to be a whole lot of options left," said city councillor Joanne Schivley. "We are going to be out of money by June 30. It's all a numbers game now."
Cities and towns rarely go bankrupt. Since 1937, there have been 543 municipal bankruptcies, two-thirds of which were small tax districts established to sell municipal bonds for projects, according to James Spiotto, a municipal bankruptcy specialist at Chapman and Cutler LLP in Chicago.
The last California city to file was Desert Hot Springs, a town of 20,000 that was hit with a legal judgment it couldn't afford. Orange County filed in 1994 amid bad bets on derivatives.
Vallejo's plight stems from rising pay for police and firefighters under current labour contracts. The problems were compounded by plunging home values, declining retail sales, and a slowdown in new housing development that cut $5-million from the city's revenue projections between June and February.
City and labour union officials have been meeting since January to revise the existing contracts. The unions have balked at pay cuts.
The fiscal strains afflicting Vallejo are reverberating across the U.S., as a housing slump and slowing economy curb revenue for states and local governments.
The area has since been one of the hardest hit in Northern California by the housing market slump. Home prices in Solano County, where the town resides, dropped 19 per cent in January from the year before, according to DataQuick Information Systems.
There are currently 1,214 "real estate owned" homes in Vallejo, meaning that the homeowners have been foreclosed and their lenders now own the houses, according to Irvine, Calif.-based RealtyTrac. Another 1,014 properties are in the foreclosure process, and 464 houses are scheduled to be auctioned.

Full text:   Five CFL teams are aggressively pushing plans to build new stadiums or drastically alter and refurbish old ones
Over the past quarter-century, North American sports facilities have undergone a revolution in design, followed by building booms that have swept through every level - from junior hockey and minor-league baseball through the NBA, NHL, NFL and Major League Baseball.
All of which has left the CFL looking a little like the league left behind as it continues to make do mostly with stadiums built for another era.
But after years of Band-Aid solutions to stadium up-keep, the CFL could be on the verge of a construction boom that could change the look of the league and dramatically improve its economics as well.
Five CFL teams - the Montreal Alouettes, Winnipeg Blue Bombers, Hamilton Tiger-Cats, Saskatchewan Roughriders and the ownership of a conditional Ottawa franchise - are aggressively pushing plans to build new stadiums or drastically alter and refurbish old ones.
Factor in the anticipated makeover of Vancouver's B.C. Place Stadium, which could add a retractable roof to the facility, and a potential redesign of Toronto's BMO Field to accommodate the Argonauts, and the CFL could be looking at well over a half-billion dollars invested in stadium infrastructure during the next five years.
Many would suggest it's long overdue.
"This is a league that is primarily driven by ticket sales, so the weakness is when you have older stadiums it's harder to attract people," CFL commissioner Mark Cohon said. "You can have a great product on the field, but when people go to a stadium where it's not a nice experience to be in - the washrooms are gross, they don't have a seat back, there's limited parking - then they go down to the street to an NHL game with beautiful suites, great concessions and easy to get in and out of, that creates a hard operating environment for our teams."
The reason so little has been invested in CFL stadiums over the years comes down to simple economics.
For starters, football stadiums have a more challenging economic model than large hockey arenas since outdoor venues in Canada are only fully usable during some months of the year. In addition, the number of events that require 30,000 seats is relatively few.
That's why the only three CFL stadiums built since the early 1960s were constructed primarily for other purposes: Edmonton's Commonwealth Stadium (Commonwealth Games, opened 1978), B.C. Place (World's Fair or Expo '86, opened 1983), and Toronto's Rogers Centre (home of the Toronto Blue Jays, opened 1989).
Though most CFL stadiums have lacked modern amenities for some time, the league's often insecure financial footing has put stadium redevelopment on the back burner. But by doing so, CFL teams have deprived themselves of the revenue streams that teams playing in more modern facilities enjoy - from such things as suites, better concessions and premium seating, plus the possibility of creating more better demand for tickets and higher prices.
"[Surviving in outdated stadiums] I think is a testament to the fans and the strength and importance of our sport," said David Asper, the Winnipeg businessman who is promoting a plan in which he would pump $65-million of his own money into a new stadium for the Blue Bombers in a partnership with governments.
"But the dominoes are starting to fall and there's several places around the country where people are coming to that realization."
In three cities - Ottawa, Hamilton and Winnipeg - the matter isn't so much one of upgrading stadiums to improve the fan experience as it is about ensuring there is a suitable place to play CFL football.
In Ottawa, part of the stadium was condemned last fall. And both the Bombers and Ticats are arguing it makes no sense to patch up their respective stadiums, and the time has come to look to the future with a new facility.
"Our stadium was built in 1930, and there are going to be big issues with it in the next 24 months," Tiger-Cats president Scott Mitchell said. "The question is: Do you want to bury your head in the sand and pretend there isn't an issue, or do you want to be progressive about it and look at something new that's good for the community?
"It's ironic that all those other leagues have done it and it's been a great boon for them, but the league that really needs it is the CFL where 70 to 80 per cent of revenue is from the gate. In Hamilton, our bottom line is being challenged by the extreme limitations of how much we can bring in because of the stadium. We're losing opportunities of between $1.5- and $3-million a year because of the limitations of our facility."
Jeff Hunt, who heads the group that was awarded an Ottawa franchise in March on condition that Frank Clair Stadium is rebuilt, has seen firsthand what a series of new buildings can do to a league. As owner of the Ottawa 67's of the OHL, Hunt has watched the values of teams in that league skyrocket as new buildings were being built, one after another.
And it is the prospect of a new team playing in a refurbished stadium that drove Hunt's interest in bringing Ottawa back to the CFL.
"[Being in an older stadium] just gives you such a handicap," he said. "It's like trying to have a five-star restaurant in a strip mall. You're just at such a disadvantage because the stadium is such a huge part of the experience. You should walk in there and feel like you're in a special place in a pro sports environment."
There must be some opposite to the phrase, "If you build it, they will come." Maybe it's "If you don't fix it, they won't come." But Hunt's group in Ottawa faces the same challenge as several other CFL markets where local and provincial governments are wary about investing in pro sports facilities of any kind, much less for a league that hasn't always managed its affairs in the best possible way.
That's why Asper's plan - similar to the ideas under consideration in Hamilton and Ottawa - calls for a mix of private and public money with year-round recreational use and commercial development of surrounding real estate.
"Governments are increasingly less interested in paying the freight, so that's the challenge," Asper said. "But the real estate part of it creates a different business model that takes some of the pressure off the public to build it.
"You wind up with a facility that gives the fans all the aesthetics and can have year-round use. And by intelligent use of contiguous real estate, you can give the private investor a hope of a return."

THE AWARDS: SELECTION CRITERIA
'I call these people swans': Bright young leaders honoured
BY SUSAN SMITH
Since Douglas Caldwell, chairman of Caldwell Partners International Inc., founded the Top 40 Under 40 Awards in 1995, he has seen key issues wax and wane: national unity, recessions, brain drains, dot.com delirium ... This year, one of the key areas in the Canadian economy is the resource sector, where there's a wealth of opportunity for young stars to make their mark.
But when he starts talking about the awards, Mr. Caldwell is clearly more interested in the universal traits of what makes a good leader than he is about the latest business trend or hot sector.
"One thing that distinguishes the group [of honorees] this year is the giving back these people have seen as a responsibility," Mr. Caldwell says. "That is an important thing to be doing."
He and his team of 26 advisory board members, who chose the 2007 honorees from among 1,600 applicants, held to the same criteria that applied to winners in the past: They looked for people (who had to be under the age of 40 as of Dec. 31, 2007) who have shown vision and leadership, innovation and achievement, people who have made an impact and been involved in their community.
"I call these people swans," Mr. Caldwell adds, explaining that the honorees are smart, work hard, are ambitious, "and they are also nice people."
The awards - which will be presented in Toronto today - honour 40 people from across the country and across a spectrum of sectors, from business to science to civil service and academia.
The winners will attend a two-day conference featuring presentations by business leaders and an opportunity to network with hundreds of guests, many of whom are Top 40 alumni.
Mr. Caldwell says that acknowledging the accomplishments and highlighting the promise of the under-40 set is more important than ever because of changing demographics and the pace of business today,
The age of top leaders has dropped dramatically in the past 20 years, he points out. To succeed, he says, Canada needs the "energy and passion" of youth.

KIM BAIRD, 37, BRITISH COLUMBIA
First nation chief negotiated historic treaty
Chief, Tsawwassen First Nation, B.C.
BY LISA STEPHENS
Kim Baird, the youngest chief elected to head the 400-member Tsawwassen First Nation, was a key player in negotiating British Columbia's first modern urban land treaty, an agreement she proudly says will let her people "take control over our own destiny."
The historic treaty, signed on Parliament Hill last December, was the first achieved under the B.C. treaty claims procedure set up in the early 1990s, and is expected to be ratified this year. The treaty will give the Tsawwassen band ownership of lands in the Greater Vancouver Delta region, self-government provisions, fishing rights and a cash settlement.
"The Tsawwassen treaty proves that negotiations work. My community and I are absolutely convinced that the treaty is our way forward," says Chief Baird. "We no longer have to miss out on opportunities other British Columbians and Canadians have enjoyed for over the past century."
She assumed her leadership role at the youthful age of 28, when she was elected to her first term as chief of the Tsawwassen band. She was the youngest chief elected, the first woman in living memory, and is now serving her fifth term of office until 2010.
The road to ratifying the historic treaty began when she was a student at Kwantlen University College. "When I learned the history of poor relations between aboriginal nations and the province of British Columbia," she says, "and the reasons behind some of the socioeconomic conditions on the reserve, I became inspired to see if I could get involved at some level."
In fact, she was continuing a family tradition: her great-great-grandfather, Kwuntilum, known as Chief Harry Joe, initiated the land claims process for the band in 1914. Her first move was to become a land claims researcher for the band, while studying social geography at the University of British Columbia. After becoming chief in 1999, she took on the task of negotiating a viable living space for her people within their traditional terrain of the Georgia Straits, in what is now the metro Vancouver area.
Chief Baird quickly found that persuading other governments to share her vision was not the only challenge. Selling the treaty to her own band, to neighbouring land owners and the metropolitan government proved equally daunting. "Being behind such massive change isn't always popular, both within my own community, my peers and the public," she notes. "I've had to toughen up my skin," she adds wryly. "But there have been many high points along the way. And if the goals are worthwhile, the satisfaction outweighs the stress."
Of her skills at finding agreement among so many diverse communities she says, modestly, "anyone can have leadership skills and make changes to their community - you don't have to be a politician, just speak up and participate in any way you can - and make your community a better place to be."
Chief Baird, who has two young daughters, four-year-old Amy and 18-month-old Sophie, is still working on her BA degree at UBC.
"Maybe I'll finish it by the time I'm 80," she laughs.

MICHAEL HYATT, 33, ONTARIO
Leadership means knowing when to let go
Chief executive officer and co-founder, BlueCat Networks, Toronto
BY LISA STEPHENS
The tech company might be called BlueCat, but Michael Hyatt knows he's riding a tiger.
Since co-founding the company with his brother Richard in 2001, he has watched BlueCat become one of the 50 fastest-growing technology companies in Canada. It has taken the lead in its field of Internet-address management after going toe-to-toe with the likes of Alcatel-Lucent, Cisco Systems and even British Telecom. BlueCat recently was designated best in its field by NetworkWorld magazine.
The privately held company has 125 employees in offices across Canada, the United States and Europe. It doesn't release sales figures, but he does allow that sales are in the "millions per month."
BlueCat is actually his second tech success. His first was Dyadem International Ltd., which he and Richard founded in 1993 (in "suite two of our parent's home - our bedroom"), selling software they had created for their engineer father while Michael was still a student at the University of Western Ontario. The brothers still own Dyadem, which is on a similar trajectory to that of BlueCat, boasting rapid revenue growth and 125 employees.
Remarkably, both companies operate without typical venture capital support or debt. "But we have very, very good advisers," Mr. Hyatt says. "We look for smarter people than us."
The trick to being a good entrepreneur is "giving up authority as quickly as you can to people who are smarter than you. I try to become the 'dumbest guy in the room' - quickly - and empower people to make sound decisions and take total ownership for them," he says.
"If you're going to be successful as an entrepreneur, what you're constantly doing is downloading responsibility and giving up authority. The challenge is always 'letting go' and allowing the best people to run your business," he adds.
A bachelor, he laughs that "there are probably people who like entrepreneurs, but I'd have to make the time to meet them."

YURI LEITH FULMER, 33, BRITISH COLUMBIA
Fast-food baron started in the drive-through
President and chief executive officer, FDC Brands, Vancouver
BY UNNATI GANDHI
After working his way up the food chain at a North Vancouver A & W, from drive-through attendant to manager in three years, Yuri Fulmer was faced with a tough decision.
The A & W head office had decided to downsize its presence in the chain, and was franchising out 120 of its 180 locations. Employees like Mr. Fulmer, who was planning to go back to university in the fall, were given the chance to buy a restaurant. His decision to bite turned out to be one of the smartest he has ever made, although he says he hardly felt that way at the time. After all, he was just 18.
"You lie awake at night and do math on the bedroom ceiling, adding things together to make sure you're going to make it," he recalls. "But I thought, most people go into the business doing something they don't know a lot about."
He had always thought like that, which is how he got to Vancouver in the first place. Leaving his native Australia at 16 to see the world, he fell in love with Vancouver and stayed put.
He intended to do the same thing with this business; he put all his money into the venture, while his mother remortgaged her condo to help pad the bank loans. He barely made ends meet in the first year. But business picked up, and Mr. Fulmer bought a second location, then a third.
Eventually, his company held assets in seven A & W restaurants and 27 Pizza Hut locations in British Columbia and Alberta. In 2006, his FDC Brands acquired the entire Mr. Mikes Steakhouse and Bar chain, and rebranded it.
Mr. Fulmer hasn't looked back; he has no regrets about not obtaining a university education and says he has never been happier.
"I've always been prepared to make change in my life when something wasn't working out," he says. "If I have to make teen burgers myself at one A & W in order to keep working for myself, I would rather do that than have any sort of senior management or executive job working for somebody else."

PAUL JEWER, 35, NOVA SCOTIA
Diverse resumé takes exec to grocery business
Senior vice-president, finance, and treasurer, Sobeys Inc., Stellarton, N.S.
BY MICHAEL RYVAL
At the ripe age of 31, Paul Jewer was hired in 2003 to fill one of the most senior posts at Sobeys, the second-largest supermarket chain in Canada. "They took a bit of a chance on me," admits Mr. Jewer. "They saw what I was able to accomplish already in my short career, albeit an eventful one."
A native of Grand Falls-Windsor, Nfld., he is a 1994 graduate of Acadia University, where he earned a BA in business administration. He joined Sobeys with a diverse background that includes accountancy and senior positions in the software industry.
He began his career at Ernst & Young LLP and stayed four years, ultimately becoming manager of assurance and business advisory services. He then joined the fast-paced technology sector and became the controller at Halifax-based FastLane Technologies Inc.
When the company was sold in 2000 to a U.S. firm, Mr. Jewer helped the new owners integrate it with some smaller Canadian operations. Then, because Halifax had become his home, Mr. Jewer accepted an offer from Core Networks Inc. to become vice-president of finance and corporate development.
When Sobeys came knocking on his door, he was drawn to one of the best-known success stories in Atlantic Canada. "Sobeys was a chance to get back to my finance roots - and with a company in Atlantic Canada whose scale was difficult to match," notes Mr. Jewer, a recreational runner who is married and has a daughter.
Today, he is a senior member of the team that manages a vast operation, with revenues of more than $13-billion, 75,000 employees and more than 1,300 stores under several banners, including Sobeys, IGA and Thrifty Foods. Challenges are ever-present, he says.
"The grocery business is very competitive and it's critical to engage all your employees. Our customers come to know all our people - whether it's the store manager, the cashier, the butcher or the seafood manager. It's a business that is delivered with a personal touch."

ATUL HUMAR, 38, ALBERTA
Childhood trips to India spurred research quest
Director, Transplant Infectious Diseases; Associate professor, Department of Medicine, University of Alberta, Edmonton
It was the thrill of venturing into uncharted territory that initially drew Atul Humar into his profession.
Nearly two decades later, he still hasn't emerged from the depths of the unknown.
As director of one of only a few transplant infectious disease laboratories in the world, Dr. Humar is never quite sure where his research will take him next.
And with the specialty being a relatively new field, no one else is too sure, either.
"I liked that there was an opportunity to be on the cutting edge of something and have the opportunity to develop innovative things," he says of his decision to focus on transplants and infection diseases.
His passion was first ignited as a child, during family visits to his native India where he saw the impact that infectious diseases have on so much of that country's population.
His family immigrated to Ottawa when he was two years old and young Atul grew up looking up to his father, a civil engineering professor, and his ongoing research.
It was also during those trips to India that the future doctor noticed that transplants, which were meant to save lives, often made situations worse, because patients became infected with a disease in the process.
"They're on the waiting list for years and years, they're really sick on the waiting list, they finally get a transplant and ... they get this infection that seems to come out of the blue," Dr. Humar explains. "Some even think the transplant isn't all that they hoped for."
He immediately saw that there was a major gap in medical knowledge and decided to help close it.
From his undergraduate degree at Carleton University, to the University of Ottawa for medical school, Dr. Humar took the first steps into a just-emerging specialty.
Luckily, he says, he was able to train with two of the field's pioneers, doctors Jay Fischman and Robert Rubin, in Massachusetts.
Armed with newfound knowledge, Dr. Humar was recruited by the University of Toronto to start up a transplant infectious disease program - the first in the country - in 1999.
He was just 28, but says he didn't encounter much resistance from the older faculty.
"I created a niche for myself, because that was something nobody else at the university was doing," he explains.
And once he showed colleagues how patients could be prepared for transplants, and the chances of infection reduced drastically, "the transplant people really embraced the whole concept and they really recognized it as an important part of the whole transplant program."
Dr. Humar and his wife, Deepali Kumar, also a transplant infectious disease physician, were recruited to the University of Alberta Hospital last year, to start a program "unlike any in the country, really," he says.
They are the only husband-wife transplant infectious disease team in the world.
Their new program houses three full-time transplant infectious diseases physicians, three lab scientists, graduate students and post-doctoral fellows.
They prepare patients for transplants, and meet with them during and after the procedure for follow-ups.
When he isn't travelling for work, Dr. Humar tries to spend all his free time with his children, Sapna, 7, Saurav, 4, and Sonika, 2. (His other love is science fiction.)
His next venture is to help bring the transplant infectious disease programs into every transplant clinic.
And while that may be a sign that his specialty is no longer new, he's sure there is much more to be discovered, and many lives to be saved.

SCOTT SAXBERG, 39, ALBERTA
Riding the energy wave
President and chief executive officer, Crescent Point Energy Trust, Calgary
BY ALLISON DUNFIELD
The route from the Winnipeg Jets dressing room to the oil sands of Alberta may have been unconventional, but it worked well for Scott Saxberg, president and CEO of Calgary-based Crescent Energy Trust.
The Manitoba native says his start in the oil industry was fostered, in part, by the discipline required to juggle his university job - videotaping the Jets' performances to help the hockey players improve - with his engineering studies at the University of Manitoba.
"I look back on that now as probably where I learned a lot [in] communicating ... The environment gave me a head start."
Armed with his mechanical engineering degree, he joined Wascana Energy Inc. in Regina in 1991. But rather than having a typical junior engineer role (looking after facilities, for example) he was placed in the company's acquisition and divesture division, called Pasqua Resources, where he gained experience buying and selling properties and developing new companies.
That gave him another jump-start on his current success: "I started from the business side - that really has been the foundation of a lot of my training and experience in the last couple of years."
He worked with another company, Numac Energy, until 1996. Then a group he had worked with at Pasqua began a startup called Magin Energy, where he started as a senior engineer but quickly rose to manager of business development by 1999.
After the company was acquired in 2001 by NCE Petrofund Corp., he decided the time was right to move to Calgary, where the energy sector was booming.
There, he launched Crescent Point with partner Paul Colborne in 2001 (the company is named for the road leading to the Saxberg family's cottage in Thunder Bay). "We grew Crescent Point very rapidly as a junior [oil and gas company]. In 18 months, we were at 5,000 barrels a day."
Mr. Saxberg was named president and CEO in 2003, when the company acquired Tappit Resources Ltd. and changed into a royalty trust. He's proud that Crescent Point has grown using the same business plan as when it started, a combination of acquisitions, exploration and development.
So far, it has acquired $1-billion worth of junior companies and expanded its ownership in southeast Saskatchewan's Bakken play, an oil pool that has huge potential. Mr. Saxberg calls it "Saskatchewan's Hibernia."
"We are a $4-billion-plus entity, but we could grow it to $8-billion through growing our own assets," he says, projecting that development within three to five years.
He and wife Rachel have two sons, Graeme, 9, and Kellen, 6. Now that he's a CEO, something the soft-spoken Mr. Saxberg says he never dreamed of becoming, he has time to get back to his sports roots - coaching hockey for his boys.
"Maybe I can be coach of the year," he laughs.

CHRISTINA ANTHONY, 32, BRITISH COLUMBIA
Inspired by, and inspiring, women at work
Founder and president, Forum for Women Entrepreneurs Canada, Vancouver; Director, Odlum Brown Limited
BY UNNATI GANDHI
Christina Anthony was on her way home from one of her own training sessions for female entrepreneurs when she noticed one of the attendees preparing to spend the night in a car.
The woman, who made the two-hour trek into Vancouver to take part in programs offered by Ms. Anthony's Forum for Women Entrepreneurs organization, told Ms. Anthony that money was so tight at her fledgling company that she couldn't afford to stay in a hotel, and it was too late for her to make the long drive home. Yet here she was, week after week, upgrading her entrepreneurial skills through FWE programs.
"I just was so blown away," Ms. Anthony recalls. "I've always been very inspired by people who take risks and start their own businesses ... but it's that kind of motivation to do it, really at all costs, that was really so amazing."
Ms. Anthony, who opened her home to the woman for the night, has always had a weak spot for entrepreneurial ambition. The proof goes back to her days of winning science fairs across the country as a child (more for her knack at selling the idea of her project than displaying the science behind it) and to when she switched from a first-year science program at the University of British Columbia to a commerce program where she was able to manage a $2-million endowment fund for course credit.
That's why, when the Richmond, B.C., native moved back to Vancouver after a stint at Goldman Sachs in Seattle in 2002, she immediately saw the city had a need for mentors and training programs to help female entrepreneurs.
When she wasn't busy with her day job as a portfolio manager and director at Odlum Brown Ltd., she launched the B.C. chapter of FWE.
Now, despite having two young children and a third on the way, she has managed to expand FWE into a resource for hundreds of women who are just starting out, or are already successful, to upgrade their skills and network.

JOSEPH MICHAEL JOHNSON, 38, ONTARIO
Taking over family firm put career on new track
President, Joe Johnson Equipment Inc., Innisfil, Ont.
BY SUSAN SMITH
Joe Johnson Jr. was a gung-ho, fledgling lawyer in Waterloo, Ont., when his father was diagnosed with lung cancer in 1996. But when he decided to take time off work to move to Barrie and help care for his father, he suddenly found himself with a whole new career plan.
The senior Mr. Johnson had started Joe Johnson Equipment Inc. in the mid-1980s as a distributor of maintenance equipment for public works projects, and now he needed a succession plan, fast.
"My dad, to my surprise when I got here, said, 'If I've only got three months I don't want to be sitting behind a desk,' " Joe recalls. "So he threw the keys at me and said, 'You're the president.' "
There wasn't really any way to refuse. It was a trying time for the entire family and there was a business with $4-million in annual sales to run.
While Mr. Johnson was young to be running a company - he was still in his 20s - he had a good foundation.
His law degree from York University's Osgoode Hall proved invaluable in countless ways and because his time in practice had been spent representing municipalities, he understood the tendering process for a government department that needed, say, an industrial vacuum or a recycling vehicle or an ice resurfacer.
And his father lived for more than two years after the diagnosis, giving him time to help Joe find his stride.
Initially, the new president had to work hard to build relationships with customers and suppliers. "As far as they were concerned, I'm just a young snot-nose, a silver-spoon-in-the-mouth type of lawyer that has been entrusted with this role."
At the same time, Mr. Johnson realized that to take the business further he would have to rely on more than relationships and bring solid business disciplines to bear.
He has also learned to practice discipline when it comes to working, and co-owning, with family.
His older brother, Jeff, is vice-president of sales, and his younger brother, Jamie, is manager of inventory control. They have a policy of not confusing family, ownership and management.
"If I ever saw one of my brothers saying, 'I'm an owner of this company so I'm not just going to come in on Thursday,' well, that's not kosher," Mr. Johnson says.
"At the same time, I can't be in an ownership meeting and say, 'You know what, Jamie, you made that exact same comment when we were playing T-ball 15 years ago. You've always been that way!' "
Now married with three children, he says there is no doubt that taking on the family business was the right move for him, though he doesn't expect his children to necessarily follow the same path.
"I regret what brought me to the position," he says. "But it's been phenomenal, both for me personally and professionally, and for the company."
Joe Johnson Equipment now has annual sales of $75-million and offices across Canada, as well as one in Rochester, N.Y. And the company president knows his father would be proud.

JAMES FRASER, 39, ONTARIO
HIV/AIDS charity born of experience
Co-founder, executive director, Dignitas International, Toronto
BY MARLENE HABIB
Haunted by the memory of a malnourished woman dying at the side of a road in the jungle in Zaire, James Fraser became determined not to let others perish alone. "That was the humanitarian spark, so to speak, of Dignitas International," he says of the humanitarian organization he co-founded in 2002 with Dr. James Orbinski.
The Toronto-based organization works in the developing world, notably Malawi, providing HIV/AIDS-related prevention, treatment, care and support through a community-based care model.
After six years with Medecins Sans Frontières (MSF), Mr. Fraser left that charitable group to write a book about his eye-opening 1997 mission to Zaire, where refugees were being massacred and locals murdered for helping refugees and MSF workers.
But when he put pen to paper, he couldn't get past the first page because of his recollections of that dying woman. "I realized that I have skills to stop others from dying in a similar fashion, completely alone."
The middle of three children growing up in Sudbury, Mr. Fraser says his parents emphasized thinking independently - "and following our stomach."
After graduating from the University of Toronto with a BA in peace and conflict studies/international relations and a master's in political science/public administration, he joined MSF, working in hot spots around the world. From 2000 to 2002, he served as program development officer for More Than Bandages, helping children in Kosovo, Sierra Leone and Mexico.
To get Dignitas off the ground, Mr. Fraser contacted friends and former MSF colleagues, including Dr. Orbinski, who accepted the 1999 Nobel Peace Prize on behalf of MSF and is now Dignitas's board chairman. The registered charity has 12 employees in Toronto, an office in New York City, and a budget that jumped to an estimated $6-million this year from $13,000 in 2003.
Mr. Fraser travels several times a year to the developing world, spending 10 to 25 days at a time away from his wife, Laura Janzen, a pediatric neuro-psychologist at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, and their children, Elliot, 7, and Natalie, 4.
Although he is "immersed" in work, he has begun taking karate and piano lessons with his children to "bring balance to my life."

PETER ZANDSTRA, 39, ONTARIO
Momentum fuels cell researcher
Professor, Institute of Biomaterials and Biomedical Engineering, University of Toronto
BY MARJO JOHNE
Imagine if doctors could put a cardiac-cell "bandage" over a damaged heart, or inject a gel loaded with insulin-responsive cells into a diabetic's bloodstream.
For Peter Zandstra, professor of tissue engineering and principal investigator at University of Toronto's Institute of Biomaterial and Biomedical Engineering, envisioning such medical advances is not so much an exercise in imagination as it is an educated speculation of things to come.
Dr. Zandstra trained to be an engineer at McGill University in Montreal before earning a PhD in chemical engineering and biotechnology at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver. Now he is also a Canada Research Chair in Stem Cell Bioengineering, and leads a team of researchers looking into next-generation cellular therapy based on science's ability to engineer how cells interact and communicate.
Potential applications for the research include manipulating stem cells so they become compatible with a patient's antibodies (thus reducing the risk of rejection of implanted cells), or creating barriers around the implanted cells so they don't interact with the patient's immune system.
"We're trying to understand how to control the environment around cells," says Dr. Zandstra.
It may take a few years for his work to move from the lab bench to the hospital bedside. But momentum is building in the field of cellular therapy. While he and researchers around the world are hard at work deciphering the stem cell, other scientists are busy developing methods for delivering cellular treatment.
"This is where bioengineering comes in: for instance, building tissue-engineered substrates or scaffolds that could be placed upon the heart like a Band-Aid," he says. "Or maybe the means for delivery could be an injectable gel. There are a number of possibilities."
Although scientists have been studying stem cells for years, the ability to bioengineer complex cellular systems is opening new possibilities, he says.
"I think we will see the benefits to this type of technology very rapidly. It may take us longer to score home runs, such as being able to cure a particular disease, but the field of cellular therapy is moving very quickly and we're making headway year after year."

MICHAEL D. PENNER, 38, QUEBEC
Business is 'personal thing,' even when it's global
President and chief executive officer, Richelieu Legwear, Montreal
BY LISA STEPHENS
Michael Penner has taken the old-line Quebec maker of Richelieu Legwear into the 21st century with aplomb and confidence.
A history graduate of McGill University who went on to earn his juris doctor at Hofstra University and was called to the bar in New York state, he returned to Montreal to work with his father as a specialist in mergers and acquisitions when the elder Mr. Penner acquired Richelieu Knitting Inc. in a leveraged buyout.
In 2006, Michael became president and CEO of Richelieu when he purchased the company. He set a new course, determined to reinvent Richelieu as a global, branded and entirely offshore maker of socks and leg wear. After deciding to reduce the Canadian head office to a small group and produce its knitwear offshore, Richelieu was rewarded in 2008 by being named top vendor of the year for Wal-Mart Canada, with a 33-per-cent sales increase.
Richelieu is also making inroads in the U.S. and European markets. Its products are sold under the brands OshKosh B'Gosh, Wonderbra, Peds, Eddie Bauer, Gold Bug and WonderKids. Its customers include Sears, Loblaws, The Bay, Polo, Zellers, Sam's Club, Costco, Wal-Mart and Disney.
The price of going offshore to reduce costs is a heavy travel schedule for Mr. Penner. A typical week sees him winging from Montreal to Shanghai, Tokyo, Seoul, Phnom Penh, Dubai and Istanbul.
"I really grind it out. I fly overnight to avoid staying in hotels."
But he notes that a changing international business environment still demands the human touch. "Business is still a personal thing, no matter where you are in the world - you have to be there, talking with your team," he says. "This gives us a huge competitive advantage."
Mr. Penner is married and has two young daughters. One of his favourite family pastimes is using his travel points to go on trips together.

WILLIAM MOORE, 37 ALBERTA
Newcomer finds Canada a 'wonderful opportunity'
Senior vice-president, operations, Enerflex Systems Income Fund, Calgary
BY CATHRYN ATKINSON
William Moore moved his family to Calgary four years ago, when he was appointed vice-president of mechanical services for Enerflex, a supplier of products and services to the oil and gas industry. In February, the Australian native received his permanent residency card.
"It feels good to be a Canadian and now a Top 40 Canadian," he says with a laugh. "It has all come rather quickly."
Mr. Moore graduated with a bachelor of chemical engineering from the University of Sydney in 1992 and worked for the Australian Gas Light Co. before joining Enerflex's Australian operations in 1996.
He was moved to Calgary in 2004 as vice-president of mechanical services, with responsibility for operations in Canada and Central and South America. Now, as senior vice-president of operations, he supports the Australasia and European regions of Enerflex with the export of products from Canadian operations.
When it comes to doing business, Canada is similar to Australia "because both countries are fairly reliant on energy and mining," he says. "I had been coming to Canada for many years ... business-wise it hasn't been a huge difference."
Enerflex has 2,800 employees around the world, with 1,900 based in Canada. Mr. Moore says it has become more international since he moved to Canada, with about half its business coming from overseas, so he has to travel frequently.
But he likes to return to his new home town, which he says his son and daughter have taken to like ducks to water. "They love the skiing and their school. My wife was trying to organize a holiday back to Australia this June and the kids don't even want to go, and they're only six and nine."
All in all, he says, the move to Canada has been a "wonderful opportunity that I've enjoyed very much."

NICOLE LETOURNEAU, 38, NEW BRUNSWICK
Lighting a 'beacon of hope' for new mothers
Professor of nursing and Canada Research Chair in Healthy Child Development, University of New Brunswick, Fredericton
As a child, Nicole Letourneau wanted adults to stop treating her like, well, a child. She remembers thinking, "Don't talk down to me." She also felt that "people didn't give kids enough credit," says the recently appointed Canada Research Chair in Healthy Child Development at the University of New Brunswick.
"I've always been interested in children," says Prof. Letourneau, creator of the Child Health Intervention and Longitudinal Development (CHILD) studies program at the university. "Even when I was a child I wondered how we can make the best environment for children. I thought that parents and other adults had a very powerful role and they should just use that power better."
That interest was rekindled when she entered nursing school and discovered the fields of child health and pediatric nursing. She received her RN at UNB and her master's and PhD from the University of Alberta, with postgraduate certifications in child-assessment data analysis, French and teaching, before being appointed assistant professor of nursing at UofA in 1999.
In 2007, she became a tenured professor at UNB and recipient of the Canada Research Chair grant, as well as the Peter Lougheed/Canadian Institutes of Health Research and Canadian Research Institute for Social Policy fellowships.
But it was the difficult birth of her own child and her subsequent experience with the agonies of postpartum depression that provided the stimulus for the creation of the CHILD program.
Despite being a nurse, she didn't recognize she was depressed because "I didn't know what depression really was," she recalls. Worse, "no one around me recognized [it] even though I was surrounded by nurses and health care providers."
She knew that depressed mothers may not pick up on their baby's cues or provide positive feedback or meet their needs. These disturbances in mother-infant interactions can affect a baby's social and cognitive development. Intrigued, she began to explore the needs and barriers that prevented new mothers from seeking treatment for depression. She found that they wanted advice and counselling from others who had suffered postpartum depression, but from "a mother that wasn't their own mother."
The CHILD program being developed uses mothers as volunteers to counsel new mothers. "We're finding that the power of support doesn't come from professionals but from people who've been through the same experience," Prof. Letourneau says.
"They can be a beacon of hope; they can understand more."
The peer volunteers are not in the program for pay, she adds. "They're there because it turns a very negative experience [in their own past] into something very positive."

DARRYL WHITE, 39, QUEBEC
A juggler of roles in financial services
Executive managing director/head, Montreal investment and corporate banking, BMO Capital Markets, Montreal
BY ALLISON DUNFIELD
Financial services executive Darryl White has come a long way from his days as a University of Western Ontario business student who didn't know what he wanted to do until he was interviewing for jobs at the end of his studies.
But after landing a job right after graduation in 1994 with Nesbitt Thomson (now BMO Nesbitt Burns) as an analyst, he knew he had found his niche.
Because he was in a general management program at UWO, he was comfortable with the idea of juggling several roles and tasks, which served him well during his initial years. He thrives on the challenge of a job where the agenda can change abruptly.
He thinks of himself as a "part-time financial expert, part-time accountant, part-time lawyer, part-time salesman, part-time psychologist and part-time coach."
Mr. White describes his first years as an analyst and the gruelling 80- to 90-hour workweeks as a necessary "boot camp" to learn the ropes. In 1996, he was hired as an associate in investment banking at BMO Nesbitt Burns in Toronto; he was promoted to vice-president of investment banking in 1999 and then to managing director, investment and corporate banking, in 2002.
In 2006, he made the jump from Toronto to his home town of Montreal. Heading up the company's investment and corporate banking practice for Quebec has been a "homecoming" for him and his family (wife Cassandra, son Nolan, 3, and daughter Leah, 1). He's thrilled to be able to get from home to office in seven minutes, and to take in the city's jazz festival and nearby skiing.
During his first full year in the position, his team achieved 40-per-cent growth in revenue. He believes part of that success may be because he has worked hard to develop rapport with his staff.
"You have to be sensitive to the fact that people are looking at you as having been sent by the Mother Ship: 'Are you one of us or one of them?' One of the things I'm proud of is I think I've achieved a sense of respect from the people who work with me."

COURT CARRUTHERS, 35, ONTARIO
Finding and keeping 'amazing' staff key part of success
President, Acklands-Grainger Inc., Richmond Hill, Ont.
BY MARLENE HABIB
Court Carruthers is the first to admit that dabbling in welding equipment and janitorial and safety supplies isn't the most glamorous business.
The president of Acklands-Grainger Inc. (AGI) and newly minted senior vice-president of the Illinois-based parent company, W.W. Grainger Inc., also says most people don't know what the company is all about, even though its roots go back nearly 120 years.
But with revenues of $700-million a year, serving 65,000 customers through 155 branches across the country, five distribution centres and about 2,200 employees, Canada's largest supplier of industrial, safety and fastener products is obviously attracting the right crowd.
"We are very focused on selling to industry and government. It's not a glamorous business or industry, but we're all fine with that," says Mr. Carruthers, who held a number of senior leadership roles in the transportation and logistics industries before joining AGI in 2002.
It's as if Mr. Carruthers, Saskatoon-born and Alberta-bred, was going home when he joined Acklands-Grainger. Founded in Winnipeg in 1889, the company grew from manufacturing and supplying wooden goods to making and selling carriages, wagons and farm machinery; when the automobile came along, it added car parts and accessories to its offerings.
In 1996, it was bought by Illinois-based Grainger, the largest industrial distributor in the United States. Acklands-Grainger, through vendor partners including 3M, GE and Black and Decker, serves a variety of industries with more than 100,000 products.
"The business is very complex from a logistics and execution standpoint," says Mr. Carruthers, a certified management accountant whose education and training have given him the tools to keep his business wits about him.
With a bachelor of commerce degree from the University of Alberta (1993) and an MBA from Queen's University in Kingston, Ont., Mr. Carruthers worked with Purolator Courier in Western Canada, progressing from sales rep to vice-president, field sales, and moving to Toronto in 1997.
In 2000, he joined Veredex Logistics as senior vice-president, business development, North America, and took on the same role, but as a vice-president, for Dynamex Inc. in 2001.
At Acklands-Grainger, he started as vice-president, national accounts and sales, and moved up. "I have worked for and with some amazing people, and this is really the most important preparation for success - finding, keeping and motivating world-class talent to achieve the full potential of a business."
The devout Edmonton Oilers hockey fan and avid golfer is preparing for a new challenge - fatherhood. His wife, Kristin, a marketing director with Purolator Courier, is expecting their first child in June.
"For me, it is very busy all the time, but only with activities that I like and people I really enjoy being around, both at work and outside."

REZA SATCHU, 38, ONTARIO
'Always seek positions of discomfort'
Co-founder, chairman and chief executive officer, Stellation Asset Management, Toronto
BY ALLISON DUNFIELD
Reza Satchu is a big believer in taking risks, putting himself in challenging situations and creating his own opportunities.
"One of my big mottos is: Always seek positions of discomfort," says the entrepreneur and founder of Stellation Asset Management LLC, a global equity hedge fund.
Nothing has come easy for Mr. Satchu, who emigrated from Kenya to Scarborough, Ont., with his family as a child. But he appreciates that his parents, Rustom and Zarina, encouraged risk-taking and fostered high expectations in their children at an early age. "They showed me that taking risks in a calculated way is a smart thing to do."
After high school he headed to McGill University to become a doctor, a "typical Indian family" thing to do, he says. But he realized that he gravitated toward capitalizing on opportunities and switched to economics, graduating in 1991.
Seeking greater challenges, he headed to Wall Street and landed a job at Merrill Lynch & Co. as a financial analyst.
But he realized he wasn't interested in the corporate side of business. "I wanted to be someone who was actually creating something."
He then went to Harvard Business School, earning his MBA in 1996. From there, his career took a number of risky, and highly profitable, turns. He was a managing director at Fenway Partners in New York, a private equity investment firm that bought and sold underperforming companies.
In 1999, he and his brother, Asif, created SupplierMarket, a procurement software company that sold products to Fortune 500 companies; two years later, they sold the company for $925-million.
Mr. Satchu and his wife, Marian Annau, started a family and decided to move back to Toronto (they now have three children, six-year-old Talia and four-year-old twins, Alyana and Nikhil).
In 2002, Mr. Satchu and his brother established a second business, StorageNow Holdings, which became Canada's second-largest storage company; last year, they sold it for $110-million.
His launched his latest project, Stellation, in 2005. The highly successful hedge fund company was ranked by UBS as one of the top global equity long/short hedge fund of funds for 2007 and includes investors from the world's largest private equity funds, including Citibank.
Although Mr. Satchu says Stellation combines all of his previous talents and ambitions into something he finds satisfying, he has also set his sights on another challenge: developing the entrepreneurs of the future.
To that end, he created a class in "economics of entrepreneurship" at University of Toronto's economics department.
He and his family knocked on the school's door and pitched the idea of a class funded, taught and administered by Mr. Satchu. He isn't paid for his teaching, and every year gives the top student in the class a $5,000 scholarship.
True to his nature, the class is highly competitive and forces students to think on their feet, but has been rated by students as a top arts and science course for four years running. "It's highly uncomfortable," he says, "but guess what? You learn the most when you are uncomfortable."

MARTIN COUTURE, 39, QUEBEC
A third-generation, eco-friendly businessman
President, chief operating officer, Sanimax, Montreal
BY MARLENE HABIB
Martin Couture is passionate about getting the word out that one person's, or workplace's, garbage is another industry's gold mine.
He puts in long weeks as head of operations across five business units of Montreal-based Sanimax, which transforms byproducts from the meat and food industries into materials for other sectors.
The married father of three young children tries to keep the weekends and holidays solely for his loved ones. But given the size of the family-owned business, with about 1,200 employees, and facilities in Quebec, other parts of Canada and the United States, and his efforts to increase public awareness of Sanimax's work, it's hard to avoid shop talk on off-work days.
"I've always had one goal in life - to possibly grow our company and increase the value," Mr. Couture says, eager to build on the success that began with the business his grandfather, Alex, founded in 1939. "I look at some of the pictures of my grandfather's first rendering plant, which was in a small building ... and that's always motivating."
Despite Sanimax's role in the food and agribusiness industries in North America, such as collecting used cooking oil and animal byproducts that would normally be tossed out, it hasn't always been easy to convince the public that what it does is good for the planet.
That's changing. As consumers become more environmentally aware and eco-friendly, Mr. Couture is placing a lot of emphasis on marketing. "When you go to the grocery store and you get your chicken, you get the top-quality stuff; you don't worry about where the rest of the product [such as bones, fat, offal and feathers] is going to go," he notes. "We're using that product."
"What really feels good is people are slowly starting to recognize what we do," he adds. "In the early days, when people heard we took byproducts from plants, they would have said, 'You guys pollute.' ... We do not pollute. We are taking byproducts out of the environment and putting them to use."
Through its rendering service, Sanimax diverts animal byproducts from landfill sites and transforms them into purified fat and protein products, serving butcher shops, farmers, supermarkets, restaurants and meat processors.
The food and restaurant industry, which generates thousands of tonnes of used cooking oil and grease each day, has benefited from Sanimax's sanitary removal system since 1927, when the company was known as Burbank Grease Services. Instead of clogging municipal sewer systems and landfills, the oil and grease are recycled into products such as clean-burning biodiesel, animal feed and soap.
In 1990, Mr. Couture earned a BA in economics from St. Lawrence University in New York and joined his family's company, Sanimal Inc., as director of corporate development.
Having also studied at the McGill International Executive Institute, he was promoted to executive vice-president, overseeing all subsidiary companies, in 1997, and became president in 2000 - the same year his father, board chairman Murray Couture, passed away.
Five years later, Martin Couture and his brother André, the new board chairman, oversaw a major acquisition and doubling of the company's size. Sanimax was created from Sanimal; the Anamax Group, a recycler of food products since 1981 in Green Bay, Wisc.; and Bi-Pro Marketing Ltd., a worldwide marketer of premium products and ingredients based in Guelph, Ont.
Sanimax is also involved in joint ventures and is constantly striving to fine-tune its business strategies, to stave off competition from companies such as Maple Leaf Foods and boost the bottom line.
"We'd like to be more aligned towards acquisitions in the U.S.," Mr. Couture says. "If there are acquisitions available, we're looking at them."

Corporate strategist loves a challenge
Senior vice-president, operations, Atlantic Lottery Corp., Moncton

When Adrienne O'Pray was studying neuroscience at Dalhousie University in the late 1980s, she spent summers working at a Canada Employment Centre, helping students find summer jobs.
"I really enjoyed assessing peoples' needs and promoting student employment with this team of people, working in both English and French," she recalls.
The St. John's native had planned to become a pharmacist. Then it happened. She was in a classroom laboratory studying cockroach legs when it dawned on her: "This isn't me. I don't see myself like this, working on my own. But I had to finish the science degree and decided to get an MBA."
Ever since that realization, her metier has been in managing people and helping organizations go through change. After earning an MBA at the University of New Brunswick in 1992, and completing an internship at a clothing factory in Poland, Ms. O'Pray got the call, literally, from telecom company NBTel Inc.
She flew home to start in sales and eventually became a sales manager. Working with chief executive officer Gerry Pond, she appreciated how the organization adapted to far-ranging regulatory change.
Over the next 11 years, and as NBTel was renamed Aliant Inc. (which later joined the BCE Inc. family), she moved to other posts and her role expanded. She became director of customer service and also took on special projects, such as product development.
"It was by design. The leadership was aggressive and made sure that people could work, and see, all parts of the company," says Ms. O'Pray, a mother of two who relaxes by skating in the family's backyard rink and practising yoga.
In 2000 she became general manager of client services at xwave, a business solutions provider that is now a division of Bell Aliant. For two years, she was responsible for developing a support services team that grew to 500 employees from 50.
She wasn't planning to change jobs but in 2003 she did just that, taking on a senior post at Atlantic Lottery Corp., which manages the lottery and gaming business in the four Atlantic provinces, and earned a profit of $382-million on $1-billion in revenue in 2006-07.
"I really liked working in the corporate strategy area and dealing with the changes required to stay current," says Ms. O'Pray, who joined ALC because its new CEO, Michelle Carinci, wanted to revitalize the organization. That goal has been largely accomplished, she says.
"We are looking for responsible growth through innovation. That's why we continue to focus on new channels and new lines of business to deliver relevant, responsible products that provide the experience that our players are looking for."

PATRICK SPENCE, 33, ONTARIO
In at the start, RIM exec still excited
Vice-president, Research In Motion Ltd., Waterloo
BY MICHAEL RYVAL
Patrick Spence displayed some impeccable timing back in 1998. While many of his classmates at the Richard Ivey School of Business at the University of Western Ontario were going into investment banking, he joined Research in Motion Ltd. (RIM), maker of the now-ubiquitous BlackBerry.
The hand-held communication device was still on the drawing board, and the company employed about 180 people, compared with 7,500 today. "Nobody had heard of the company, so there were a few raised eyebrows. I had to explain why I didn't want to go to London or New York," he recalls.
However, he had spent a spring break at RIM and was convinced he had a future there. He remembers how his classmates were intrigued by the Inter@active Pager, a precursor to the BlackBerry.
"They seemed to start getting it then ... It was a little different [career path] for a business grad."
His choice panned out; over the next decade his career at RIM coincided with the remarkable growth of the BlackBerry, now used by more than 14 million people worldwide.
At first, the company needed to break new ground. Mr. Spence, who began as a product manager, helped accomplish that when he successfully targeted the Inter@active Pager to the financial services community. In 2000, within a year of the launch of the BlackBerry, he and his team had landed major deals with clients such as Merrill Lynch and Fidelity Investments.
"RIM is a large company, but it has an entrepreneurial environment," he says. "I was able to use [its] resources and was given a lot of leeway to do what we had to do to become successful."
Then he took another unorthodox step. He moved to the company's information technology side and, as senior manager of customer implementations, helped develop RIM's enterprise resource-planning system, covering its entire operations, from finance to manufacturing.
In 2002, he moved to Melbourne, Australia; as vice-president, Asia-Pacific, he focused on developing relationships with telecommunications carriers in Hong Kong, India and Australia. On his return two years later, he continued to oversee that region's growth for about a year and then became vice-president responsible for RIM's largest carriers in North America.
He says one of the most exciting developments is the way lower-cost versions of the BlackBerry, such as the Pearl, have taken off; they now account for about 30 per cent of the subscriber base.
"We are still in the early days," says Mr. Spence, a father of two who recently took up marathon running. "More consumers want real-time access to e-mail or instant messaging or social networking."

BRENDAN CALDWELL, 37, ONTARIO
Father inspired financial go-getter
President and chief executive officer, Caldwell Investment Management Ltd., Toronto
BY MARLENE HABIB
As one of the top movers and shakers in the financial services industry in North America, Brendan Caldwell, head of various divisions of Caldwell Securities, doesn't have to look far to find his inspiration.
Mr. Caldwell says his dad Tom ("who is only 64") founded the company in 1980 at age 37 - Brendan's age.
"My father is still very much engaged in our business, and has been a tremendous influence on me personally and professionally ... Fathers are always a source of inspiration and competition for their sons," says Mr. Caldwell, who has four children with his wife of nearly 15 years, Sandra.
Tom Caldwell is chairman of Caldwell Financial and his younger son, Theo, is also a force in the firm, which has offices across southern Ontario and in New York City.
In a family dedicated to philanthropy and volunteer work, Brendan is passionate about his church, the Church of the Messiah, and Christian education, serving on the board of trustees at various schools.
He spent more than three years as an investment adviser at RBC Dominion Securities before joining his father's firm in 1995, when he became a chartered financial analyst. He rebranded the investment management division as Caldwell Investment Management, becoming president and CEO. He is also president of Caldwell Securities Ltd.; executive vice-president, Caldwell Financial; vice-president, Caldwell Asset Management; and founding president, Caldwell Insurance Services.
He earned a BSc from University of Toronto in 1991 and a master's degree in literary studies from Royal Holloway and Bedford New College in England in 1992.
His first "real job" was a five-month stint in customer service at Mackenzie Financial in 1991. "They put me on the phone to handle calls from investors and financial sales people," he recalls.
"Phenomenal experience not only in how the mechanisms of the mutual fund industry work, but in investor psychology, and in understanding their hopes and dreams - and their fears."

PERNILLE IRONSIDE, 33, ALBERTA
On the front lines for the world's children
Protection specialist, Democratic Republic of the Congo (eastern zone), UNICEF, Congo
BY MARJO JOHNE
Pernille Ironside's house has a view of Lake Kivu, one of the Great Lakes of Africa that lies on the border of Congo, where she lives, and Rwanda.
"When you're overlooking the lake, you have such a sense of calmness and serenity," says the Alberta native who moved to the Congolese city of Goma from New York two years ago after UNICEF assigned her the role of protection specialist in its Child Protection Section.
"It's such a contrast with what's on the other side of the compound."
What's on the other side of her housing compound is the aftermath of almost a decade of conflict in Congo. More than four million people were killed, including women and children, many of whom were raped and tortured by both government soldiers and rebel fighters.
As many as 30,000 children were also abducted from their homes and forced to join the army or rebel groups as fighters, sex slaves or camp workers, according to UNICEF.
Ms. Ironside is in Goma to help reclaim the lost children and reunite them with their families. Congo, the third-largest country in Africa, has negotiated a peace deal, and the army and various militia groups have agreed to "demobilize" and form a new army.
"The first month I arrived here, we separated more than 500 children from militia groups," says Ms. Ironside, who has a law degree from York University's Osgoode Hall in Toronto and a master's degree from Columbia University in New York.
"That involved many days of continually going back to this huge military site way off in the boonies, always heavily escorted by UN armed troops."
The fact that she is a woman helped in some ways, she says. "Being a Western woman coming to meet with Congolese military commanders, you have a certain surprise factor because they're thinking, 'Who is this cute little thing coming to chat with me?' and in the meantime you're prepared to do some serious negotiation and hammering."
She was no stranger to such a task, having previously worked at the South Asia Human Rights Documentation Centre in New Delhi and the UN Office for Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs on Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflicts, among other posts.
In Goma, children taken into her care stay in a transitory centre or are placed with a foster family until their own relatives - if they are still alive - are located. The children get medical help and counselling, as well as a "reintegration package" that lets them go to school to learn a vocation or to invest in a livelihood, such as raising goats, she says.
While she can claim credit for rescuing hundreds of children, she says it's often difficult to feel victorious in the face of all that has happened in the country. "It's toughest when I interview the children on a one-on-one basis, to hear the tiny voice explaining the horrific things that happened to them," she says.
"But it is also awe-inspiring to see how courageous they are, and so rewarding to see the relief and joy in their eyes when they realize they are coming into protective care."

HAMNETT HILL, 36, QUEBEC
Dot.com bubble veteran back on the fast track
President, chief executive officer and co-founder, Radialpoint Inc., Montreal
BY SUSAN SMITH
In many industries, Hamnett Hill would not be deemed old enough to lean back and tell war stories. But his business is technology, where it doesn't take long to earn the status of veteran. He did, after all, come through the dot.com crash of 2001 and live to tell about it.
He got his start in start-ups early. While studying business administration at Montana State University in the early 1990s, he founded a company to help executives create multimedia presentations. Though he was on track to become an accountant, he switched gears to come back to Montreal to start, along with his father and brother, an Internet service provider called Infobahn. The company eventually merged with a competitor and was sold to BCE Emergis.
In 1997, they started Zero-Knowledge Systems, offering encryption technology to help customers ensure privacy on the Net.
The company raised $55-million (U.S.) in venture capital and attracted top-notch techies.
But when the dot.com bubble burst, Mr. Hill was forced to reduce his staff to 50 from 275 and reposition the company - fast - before the money ran out. In 2005, Zero-Knowledge was reborn as Radialpoint; it works with broadband service providers, such as Bell Canada and Telus, to provide Internet virus protection, firewalls, backup and parental controls.
"Ultimately it was a combination of being stubborn and also feeling a lot of responsibility to people who had invested," he says of the drive to keep going through tough times. His staff has grown to 140 and the company went from zero to $40-million revenue in five years, putting it back on the fast track.
"Business is going to go up and down. Markets are going to change. You're not going to hit every time," says Mr. Hill, who is single and whose hobbies include sailing, scuba diving and skiing.
He believes the old analogy of "turning the ship around" doesn't work any more for his kind of business. "In technology, it's more like a plane," he explains.
"You can't just sit there and float - you're either going down, or you're going up. You're going to hit all kinds of turbulence. You've got to just keep driving forward."

GREG HICKS, 36, ONTARIO
A passion for retail, and the lure of rural life
Chief operating officer, TSC Stores L.P., London, Ont.
BY MARLENE HABIB
Keep the city, just give Greg Hicks that countryside - and consumers looking for farm tools and equipment, work wear, pet and horse supplies and garden needs.
Mr. Hicks is chief operating officer of TSC Stores, a limited partnership operation with 36 stores in Ontario, from Sarnia to Cornwall, and one in Brandon, Man. A cross between a "country general store and a do-it-yourself centre," the London, Ont.-based firm has three more stores coming, two in Ontario and one in Manitoba.
"At TSC Stores ... we have a saying that, 'You can buy everything we carry somewhere else, but you can't find somewhere else that sells all that we carry,'" says Mr. Hicks.
TSC Canada began as a wholly owned subsidiary of Tractor Supply Co. of Nashville in 1966, but has been Canadian-owned and operated since 1987. Birch Hill Equity Partners of Toronto purchased majority control of TSC Stores in May, 2005.
Recruited by Birch Hill in 2006, Mr. Hicks knows what it takes to make a retail winner. The second eldest of four boys growing up in Markham, Ont., his dad and two uncles owned Canadian Tire stores. While working at his father's Aldershot store, he realized "a small store makes you appreciate the mechanics of retail, and this is where I began to develop a passion for being in retail."
He earned a BA in political science from the University of Western Ontario in 1993, and then a bachelor in business administration at the Ivey School in marketing and accounting in 1995.
After graduation, Mr. Hicks moved through the Canadian Tire ranks, becoming divisional regional vice-president, store design and merchandising, before moving to TSC Stores.
"I found myself running to a great opportunity for myself and my family here at TSC, not running away from anything at Canadian Tire," says Mr. Hicks, who has two sons under the age of two with his wife, Alison.
With more than 800 "team members," Mr. Hicks sees TSC Stores becoming a national retailer - though you won't find one in urban centres.
"We solely operate in small and rural towns and suburbs. ... We stick to our knitting, which is catering to those who enjoy what we call the country lifestyle."

CAROLYN ROGERS, 38, BRITISH COLUMBIA
Hands-on CEO employs power of teamwork
President and chief executive officer, Hydroxyl Systems Inc., Victoria
BY KERRY GOLD
When Carolyn Rogers joined Victoria's Hydroxyl Systems in 2005, she inherited a small, troubled business in urgent need of a
makeover. The wastewater treatment company was coming out of bankruptcy protection, and it was her job to regain the trust of both customers and staff.
"The first thing is, you don't try to pretend the past didn't happen," says Ms. Rogers, who has an MBA from Queen's University. "You own up, you say, 'We screwed up, but it's not the end of the world - here's how we are going to make it different.' "
Hydroxyl designs and installs wastewater-treatment technology and had suffered partly because it was ahead of the environmental curve. She says it also needed to refocus its spending, which is where she came in as chief financial officer. A year later, she was steering the ship as CEO, successfully re-establishing relationships with customers such as a cruise ship line.
Ms. Rogers says it's in her nature to go into a company and fix things. The Winnipeg native got her BA from Brandon University and quickly worked her way up banking and credit union systems in management positions in Manitoba, Alberta and Saskatchewan.
After she and her husband, Matt, moved to Vancouver, she worked for three years as a business consultant. But she missed having "skin in the game" - direct responsibility for a project. Her hands-on philosophy extends to the community volunteer work she has done since age 11; today, she is a member of the board of a seniors theatre group.
"When [Hydroxyl] came along my husband said, 'You wanted a chance to do it your way, so here it is.' ... It's harder than a startup, where at least you have a clean slate. But we had 10 years of sketchy history and mistakes. We had to start with all that baggage and it was challenging."
Since she came on board three years ago, she has built the staff roster to 38 employees from nine. She sees her greatest achievement as changing the company culture. "When you have a group of people who have lived through a near-death experience like that, it gets to be a pretty cynical bunch. It wasn't much teamwork. And the team we have now is just amazing."

SIMON KENNEDY, 38, ONTARIO
Cabinet insider sees job as 'privilege'
Deputy secretary to the Cabinet (operations), Privy Council Office, Government of Canada, Ottawa
BY MARJO JOHNE
A working day in the life of Simon Kennedy is busy with the business of helping to make this country tick.
As deputy secretary of cabinet operations in the Privy Council Office - the government agency that gives the Prime Minister public-service advice on policy and operational matters - Mr. Kennedy is part of an important group of public servants who assist the Prime Minister and manage cabinet's decision-making system.
"The way our parliamentary democracy is structured, if you are a minister and you want to do something to fix an issue that falls within your statutory responsibility and you have a program and budget that allows it, then you go and do it," explains Mr. Kennedy, who became operations deputy secretary last year after a decade working in many roles at the Privy Council Office.
"But if an issue isn't addressed by policy, if you have no budget for it, and if it falls outside your scope of responsibility, then that's a decision that must be made by cabinet."
This is where Mr. Kennedy comes in, working behind the scenes to put proposals on the cabinet agenda, making sure the right people are involved, and providing non-partisan advice on public policy issues.
"The majority of what I deal with involves domestic policy. My role is to work with departments and facilitate their business, to resolve problems, and try to get decisions while at the same time providing the Prime Minister with independent advice."
Providing non-partisan policy advice can be challenging, requiring the ability to distinguish between solid analysis and his own personal biases, says Mr. Kennedy, who began his public service career at Transport Canada, where he held various positions between 1990 and 1997.
After more than 10 years of being part of the inner workings of Canadian democracy, he's still impressed. "It is so amazing to see it working day in and day out, and to watch the seriousness with which members of cabinet deliberate the issues that affect our country. And to be a part of that - it's a real privilege."

MIHNEA C. MOLDOVEANU, 39, ONTARIO
Entrepreneur carves niches in two worlds
Founder and chief technical officer, Redline Communications Group Inc., Markham, Ont.;
Associate professor and director, Desautels Centre for Integrative Thinking, Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto
BY ALLISON DUNFIELD
Since he was a child, Romanian-born professor Mihnea Moldoveanu has sought to examine the world and its great thinkers. But success came to him as the founder of technology company Redline Communications and the director of the Desautels Centre for Integrative Thinking because he isn't content to simply think and examine - action must follow.
"It's a bit different and strange because I've done this concurrently," he says of his dual career as a businessman and teacher.
"Usually people do something entrepreneurial and then they go into academia, or they are in academia and then they go out and do something entrepreneurial. But I like to do things, and I like to think about things at the same time, so it didn't really work for me to do one at a time."
He says the crux of the Desautels centre, part of the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto, is to encourage students to learn an innovative, integrative way to process information. The method taps into the thinking patterns of leaders in fields such as engineering, medicine and design, and applies them to business.
He finds the process highly rewarding. "I don't know of any program in the world in which students are trained in this and allowed to practice these skills."
His own life has been a series of trying out various ways of thinking. In 1980, his family fled to Canada from the political turmoil of Romania and began to develop a life in Toronto. Early on, he thought his path was set - as a classical pianist.
But by age 16, he realized he didn't want to spend hours a day practising. He finished all of his Grade 13 classes in Grade 12; boredom drove him to complete high school early.
He was accepted at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1986 and graduated with bachelor's and master's degrees in mechanical engineering in 1992. However, he still felt unsettled and took graduate classes in a variety of topics, including French literature.
After several false starts on PhDs in areas such as biomechanics and plasma physics, he was accepted to Harvard Business School's doctorate program and graduated with his doctor of business administration in 1997. Later, he did a post-doc fellowship at Harvard's graduate school of business.
While working on his DBA in 1994, he had become interested in digital processing and landed a $270,000 Canadian government industrial research grant. That allowed him, in 1995, to launch Hefaistos Inc., a high-tech company in Markham, Ont.. And he began commuting to Markham every two weeks from Boston.
In 1999, he moved to Toronto and sold Hefaistos for a $20-million profit to private investors, right before the Internet boom began to dissolve.
That same year, he jumped back into the fray, creating another tech company, Redline, which focuses on wireless broadband equipment, wireless-based stations, as well as handsets and customer equipment. He continues to be involved as chief technical officer.
After a fateful 1999 meeting with Roger Martin, dean of Rotman, at which the two began developing the Desautels centre, he says he now feels like a "kid in a candy store," able to spend his "17-hour days" in both academia and the business world.
And Mr. Moldoveanu, who has been married for six years to Violeta Luca, recently published a book, The Future of the MBA: Designing the Thinker of the Future , which he hopes will become a sort of blueprint for business school management teams. "I'm looking forward to integrative thinking becoming a movement across business academia."

GEORGE ROSSOLATOS, 35, ONTARIO
Taste for commerce born in father's repair shop
Partner and co-founder, TorQuest Partners Inc., Toronto
BY MARJO JOHNE
George Rossolatos learned about business in his father's auto repair garage, where he spent many summers working for what seemed like a kingly wage of 50 cents an hour.
"I was balancing cash when I was nine years old and dealing with customers," recalls Mr. Rossolatos, partner and co-founder of TorQuest Partners Inc. in Toronto.
Those informal business lessons - later supplemented with a commerce degree from Queen's University in Kingston and an MBA from Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management in Chicago - have certainly come in handy.
For seven years, he and business partner Brent Belzberg have been building their company, as well as other businesses. As a private equity firm, TorQuest seeks control or partnerships in companies operating in established industries. "We do friendly deals," Mr. Rossolatos says.
"We look primarily at Canadian businesses where we can bring our expertise and transform them into something that's bigger, better and has more value."
Along the way, TorQuest has grown, to 19 employees and more than $700-million of equity capital under management. Not bad for a company born in a coffee shop. In 2001, Mr. Rossolatos was working as assistant vice-president at the Toronto investment firm Harrowston Inc. when it was bought by TD Capital. Shortly after, Mr. Belzberg, who had founded Harrowston, approached him about starting a company. "We met at Starbucks and figured out what we wanted the new company to look like," Mr. Rossolatos recalls. "We drafted the prospectus and then pitched our idea to investors."
By February of 2002, TorQuest had raised $135-million of private equity capital. He is happy to report that his father, now retired, is extremely proud of him.
"I still go back and visit the garage, which is now run by some of the guys who were working for my Dad. There are a lot of happy memories in that place."

LAKSHMI RAJ, 38, ALBERTA
For software exec, business is a family affair
Co-chief executive officer and co-founder, Replicon Inc., Calgary
BY CATHRYN ATKINSON
Lakshmi Raj is currently on maternity leave with her seven-month-old daughter, her first child. She prepared for the big event by ensuring that her brainchild, Replicon, the Calgary software engineering company she founded in 1996 with husband Raj Narayanaswamy, was well taken care of. Now checking e-mails and attending occasional meetings is a huge change of pace for Ms. Raj, the company's co-chief executive officer. "Life has changed dramatically," she says.
"I've learned to take things slowly and there aren't big schedules to keep right now. We are trying to stay flexible to [my daughter's] needs, so I made sure we hired key people into the roles I would be vacating."
Time management, it seems, is in her blood, not least because the products created by Replicon are meant to help business owners and employees do just that. The company is a world leader in Web-based time and expense management software. Its flagship product, Web Timesheet, creates a real-time analysis of worker productivity and helps set employee productivity goals.
Replicon now has 6,700 customers in 58 countries, 140 staff in Calgary, and $15-million a year in revenue. Ms. Raj says its success with clients such as Hewlett-Packard, Nike, Amazon, BP Oil and Ferrari was built on the back of three early product failures shortly after Replicon began.
"After that experience, we sat down and asked ourselves what we were doing wrong. We felt we were coming from a very non-business perspective, so we looked at our customers and their needs more closely," says Ms. Raj, who earned a BE in electrical engineering from Anna University in India in 1991, and a BSc in computer science from the University of Calgary in 1995.
The change in approach paid off. Replicon's products are known for their ease of use, and the company espouses high-quality customer service. Ms. Raj says its employees are also key.
"We have a list of core values for our employees, and while we are a highly achievement-driven company, we also try to have a lot of fun."

TODD TOWERS, 35, BRITISH COLUMBIA
Artistic self-starter has down-home roots
Founder and president, Farmboy Fine Arts Inc., Vancouver
BY KERRY GOLD
Todd Towers credits his upbringing on a ranch outside Red Deer, Alta., for his success as founding owner of Farmboy Fine Arts. His Alberta roots run deep: the Towers family has owned the ranch for 100 years, and his grandfather, Gordon, was a long-serving MP in the 1970s and lieutenant-governor of the province in the '90s.
Todd credits his father for his own business drive: "I think my dad's an artist. He grew up on a cattle ranch and is very creative, the way they do things. So having that entrepreneurial spirit, I always thought I could make a go of it in the fine arts."
His eight-year-old company develops site-specific art for corporate environments, including internationally owned hotels such as Starwood, Trump, Hyatt, Caesar's Palace, MGM and Wynn.
Mr. Towers, who is engaged to Jasmine Kamel, graduated with a degee in fine arts from University of Calgary in 1996 and converted a warehouse space into a gallery. He worked at odd jobs while building his art-making career.
A light bulb went off when he realized there was a niche in the hospitality market for customized artwork. "You sell one piece in a private residence," he explains, "but in a hotel environment you multiply that times 500."
A year after he started Farmboy, the company suffered a setback because of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. "Not much was happening in my industry; people weren't buying art and they certainly weren't staying in hotels."
He rebounded when he was awarded a six-figure contract with luxury hotel chain W Hotels. Today, Farmboy, which emphasizes technology and an online presence in its business plan, licenses work by more than 150 photographers, artists and illustrators.
The company has grown to a staff of 16 and Mr. Towers, who also sits on the foundation board of Vancouver's Emily Carr Institute of Art & Design, has two active business partners.
Farmboy is now broadening its reach and negotiating a deal for a line of home decor products, he says. "As my dad always said, I would rather have 10 per cent of something rather than 100 per cent of nothing."

MARK J. COHEN, 39, QUEBEC
Laser-vision surgeon saw an opportunity
President, Lasik MD, Montreal
BY LISA STEPHENS
Mark Cohen co-founded Lasik MD in 2001 and has since built the company into the top provider of laser vision correction in Canada and the country's largest privately owned medical services firm.
The company has some 350 employees and has been named one of the 50 best managed businesses in Canada. With 19 clinics, Lasik MD performs about one of every three laser-vision procedures in this country.
As a practising surgeon, Dr. Cohen has performed more than 40,000 procedures himself and spends three days a week in the operating room of his Montreal clinic. He also teaches ophthalmology residents at the medical schools of Université de Montreal, Université de Sherbrooke and McGill University.
His interest in ophthalmology and lasers was piqued before he applied to medical school at age 18. He had seen some laser-vision experiments on TV and was fascinated by the combination of optics and physics. "I already knew I wanted ophthalmology - you're able to do a lot for people, since a large majority of the conditions are treatable or curable," he says.
But starting his own practice in the uncertain business climate that followed the terrorist attacks of September, 2001, provided a steep learning curve.
He saw opportunities to standardize medical protocols in his field and gain the co-operation of other surgeons in group practices.
"We really got a bunch of doctors in a field where they'd been essentially independent, and got them to make a very cohesive, strong group. That's fairly unique in medicine because typically doctors have their own practice," he says.
"We learn from each other and cover each other. I try to get as many as possible to become shareholders - and then they have a vested interest in the success of their clinic."
Dr. Cohen is single and "married to my work," he laughs. "But I live in Old Montreal, so the fun is easy to come by. The restaurants and night spots on Saint-Laurent Street are great."

PAUL SALVINI, 39, ONTARIO
Helping superheroes come to life
Chief technology officer and vice-president, Canadian operations, Side Effects Software Inc., Toronto
BY MICHAEL RYVAL
Paul Salvini always knew he would work in a creative environment, but he never expected to be in the computer graphics industry and at a company like Side Effects Software Inc. The Toronto-based firm is one of the leading providers of software used to create eye-popping special effects for scores of Hollywood movies such as Spider-Man 3 and Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix .
He credits a teacher at his high school in Uxbridge, Ont., who told him that a mathematics degree offered a great deal more flexibility than he could imagine.
"I never dreamed I would be involved in math as a career," says Dr. Salvini, who did his undergraduate math degree at the University of Waterloo and earned three more degrees, including his doctorate, at the University of Toronto.
"But I had a phenomenal computer science teacher, Richard Watson, in Grade 11 ... and he got me very interested in computers. He broke the news to me that there was a bit of a relationship between computer science and math. It was time to think favourably about math."
Dr. Salvini has since parlayed his skills into a career that has taken him to three organizations. And as an adjunct professor at University of Toronto, and formerly at Ryerson University, he has been a mentor to students trying to find their own career paths.
After graduating from UW, he joined Canadian Pacific Railway in 1992 and worked as a systems specialist in the computers and communications control branch. He helped develop a control system that monitored signals, switches and other devices for more than 700 kilometres of track in British Columbia.
"I played with real-world train sets," recalls Dr. Salvini, who is married, has two children and enjoys flying his own Cessna Skylane airplane on trips as far as Florida.
He completed his master's degree and PhD in traffic engineering and assumed that was where his future lay. From 1994 to 1996 he worked as an assistant programming supervisor at Metro Toronto Transportation and presided over key enhancements to the city's traffic-signal system.
One day he saw a newspaper ad: Side Effects was looking for someone with experience in a type of software development that, coincidentally, he was teaching in a Ryerson course. He got the job and began applying his skills to a new industry.
"The language is a little different sometimes, but [the computer applications] are all related," says Dr. Salvini, who counts the Spider-Man films among his favourite projects. "Seeing Spider-Man's web come to life for the first time was particularly rewarding, because you're helping a superhero with his super powers."
As chief technology officer at Side Effects since 1999, he has been instrumental in establishing its main software product, Houdini, within the special effects industry. Among Side Effects's larger clients is the Hollywood-based production studio Digital Domain, whose work is seen in movies such as Titanic , The Day After Tomorrow and The Lord of the Rings series.
"The key to our success ... is to have a small number of people who understand the problems and develop innovative solutions - and also have fun along the way," says Dr. Salvini, who supervises about 20 mathematicians and software architects.
"The most important thing I've done here is to find the best people and build the best possible team."

RICK MCKENNEY, 39, ONTARIO
From engineering to CFO
Executive vice-president and chief financial officer, Sun Life Financial Inc., Toronto
BY LISA STEPHENS
From a background in engineering to the financial helm of a $30-billion company isn't your ordinary career path, particularly in the conservative world of insurance and investment management.
But it's one hewn by Rick McKenney, taking him from General Electric's manufacturing management program in the United States to its global internal audit division, a post that sent him travelling worldwide to explore ways to improve the company's audit process and kindling his growing interest in finance. From there, he began an ascent through the world of global finance.
It's not atypical of GE, he notes, to take people from all walks of life and "let them excel at doing what they enjoy," so he took advantage of his growing exposure to the world of finance to get a full education in it.
He rose quickly to become the chief financial officer for the life insurance and audit division, and vice-president for business planning and analysis for GE's Financial Assurance Co.
Born in Maine and educated at Tufts University in Massachusetts, Mr. McKenney was senior vice-president and CFI of Genworth Financial Co. when he heard the call of the north and joined Sun Life in 2006 as its executive vice-president and global CFO.
Sun Life makes about 55 per cent of its income from sources outside Canada, with 15 million clients in North America, Europe and Asia.
Of his shift into finance, he says: "General Electric believes in stretching people. And," he laughs, "I was one of the people who got stretched."
Married and the father of three young children, he enjoys spending his free time being active with his family.
He is also energized by global duties that take him to Asia: "The pace in places like Mumbai and Hong Kong is exhilarating."

PATRICK LAUZON, 39, QUEBEC
A pioneer on the Net frontier
Executive vice-president, Canoe Inc., Quebecor Media, Montreal
BY MARJO JOHNE
Patrick Lauzon always believed that the Internet was the way of the future. Coming out of Montreal's Concordia University in the mid-1990s, he embarked on a couple of short-lived ventures - first a laser tag club with an Internet café, then a franchise that sold and installed Internet kiosks.
"That was in 1996, when the Internet was new and no one really knew what would come out of it," says Mr. Lauzon, who two years ago left his job as sales and business development vice-president for Sympatico/MSN to join Canoe, the Quebecor Media company that owns a number of online content and services sites such as Canoe.ca, Canoe Money and Jobboom.com.
"I didn't know what the Internet would lead to but it was of huge interest to me. I just knew that there would be plenty of business opportunities in this new frontier."
With that new frontier now an established settlement, the executive vice-president of Montreal-based Canoe hunts for ways to expand its business. He has done this by forging strategic partnerships with Yahoo! Canada and Rogers Communications.
He has also relaunched Canoe.ca's English and French websites, giving both a common look and feel to reinforce the Canoe.ca brand. When he started at Canoe, its network of websites had about 6 million visitors a month; under his leadership, that number has grown to 7.8 million.
But forget about asking him to put his feet up on his desk and take a well-deserved rest. He has already set his sights on the next big opportunity: mobile devices.
"There are a lot more cellphones than computers today in Canada, mobile bandwidth continues to expand, and the new devices are a lot faster and able to provide much richer and better user experiences," he says. "Mobile is the next growth area, and we're ready to go after it."

CHRISTOPHER S. POTTER, 35, ALBERTA
Keen player in Alberta resources
President, Peters & Co. Ltd., Calgary
BY CATHRYN ATKINSON
Location, location, location has worked in Christopher Potter's favour, professionally.
The president of Peters & Co. in Calgary is an Albertan through and through, and he greatly enjoys his role managing the independent, "boutique-style" investment firm that caters to the Canadian oil, natural gas, and oil field services industries.
"I've had opportunities to ... work for other organizations that were New York-based, or Houston-based or Toronto-based. But Alberta is a great place to live, there are lots of things both on the work side as well as the lifestyle side that lend well for people to be a part of Calgary and what is going on here," he says.
With the oil and gas business being so capital intensive, he adds, money is attracted to Calgary and Alberta, so there is no shortage of interesting opportunities for his company.
Married with two daughters, Mr. Potter is relatively young to be a president of a major Alberta investment company, which he first joined as an analyst in corporate finance after completing his bachelor of commerce at the University of Calgary in 1994.
He went on to gain his qualification as a chartered financial analyst in 1999, and last summer became president of the 37-year-old company, which has more than 80 employees.
Mr. Potter says that throughout his years at school, he was attracted to the financial side of business, and was well aware of how the oil sands were transforming the financial landscape of Alberta. He says Peters & Co. is well placed for the current hot energy market.
"We've had the wind in our sails here, in terms of financing oil sands projects. There has been strong demand in the oil field services industries over the last four or five years," he says. "It has been a good time to be in the space we are in right now."

TERRIE-LYNNE DEVONISH, 36, ONT.
'The child who would challenge'
Chief counsel, Aon Canada Inc., Toronto
BY MARLENE HABIB
Terrie-Lynne Devonish leaves no question unasked in her role as chief counsel of Aon Canada Inc.
Guess nothing has changed since she was growing up in Toronto, the middle of three daughters of immigrant parents.
"Law is something my parents thought I would be good at when I was younger because I was always the child who would challenge things, and question and argue everything," she says. Her mother was a nurse and her father worked as an electrician when the family settled in Sudbury, after moving from Guyana.
"As I grew older, I also became interested in the law as a conduit to justice and as a means of helping people, whether at work or through volunteering."
Since October, Ms. Devonish has been giving legal advice and guidance to all business units of Aon Canada, which provides risk management services, insurance brokerage and management consulting.
"I very much enjoy the mix of law and business ... and I hope to continue in a challenging legal role where I can be creative and make a difference, and add real value," she says.
With a BA in political science from York University in Toronto in 1992 and a law degree from Osgoode Hall in 1995, Ms. Devonish began her career as an associate at the law firm Fraser Milner in 1997. Three years later, she became legal counsel for HSBC Securities (Canada) Inc., and was appointed chief compliance officer, general counsel and corporate secretary in 2002. In 2004, she joined Primus Telecommunications Canada Inc. as general counsel and corporate secretary.
Her position at Aon gets so busy that she sometimes schedules time for herself into her calendar. "Sharing a really good belly laugh with my friends and my partner, or a meal with my family, or a hug from my niece and nephew centres me and keeps me going."

FERIO PUGLIESE, 39, ALBERTA
People person who likes to spread the wealth
Executive vice-president, people, WestJet Airlines Ltd., Calgary
BY SUSAN SMITH
Ferio Pugliese's title is the first indication that human resources at WestJet is a little different than at other companies. The Calgary-based airline made its mark as a people-pleaser, and the executive vice-president of people is charged with keeping it that way.
WestJet's staff has grown to 6,700 since it was founded in 1996, and each growth spurt has made it more difficult to keep the company culture from becoming impersonal.
"As we grow, the challenge is how do you maintain the culture without losing the intimacy you once had," says Mr. Pugliese, a native of the small town of Kearns in Northern Ontario.
He has degrees in social sciences, business and adult education and held HR positions in the paper and casino industries before joining WestJet.
He became VP of people last June and is now focusing on new practices in recruitment, benefits and employee relations. First, it's a matter of hiring the right people: "We look for those behaviours where a person is more upbeat, more team-oriented, a little more free-spirited," says Mr. Pugliese, who is married with two young sons.
Then it's a matter of providing the right kind of training and the right kind of atmosphere to keep your people happy so they're willing go the extra mile to do the same for customers.
The company culture is one of flexibility and inclusion, which means executives are expected to be visible and to pitch in when needed."We don't get bogged down in bureaucracy. We don't look at this stuff as programs - it's the way we do business."
Then there's the money, always a people-pleaser. More than 85 per cent of WestJet's staff participates in a share-purchase plan that allows them to use up to 20 per cent of their pretax earnings to buy shares, with the company matching contributions. Twice a year there is also a profit-sharing disbursement, which amounted to $30-million last November.
"Those are amazing events," he says of the excitement generated by the profit sharing. "I saw people dance, I saw people cry, I saw people jump up and down."
How many HR directors can make that brag?

SARAH RICHARDSON, 36, ONTARIO
Designing an empire, one room at a time
Host, co-producer and co-creator, Room Service, Design Inc. and Sarah's House ;
Principal, Sarah Richardson Design, Toronto
BY MARJO JOHNE
Some days Sarah Richardson is like a storm tracker, chasing after chaos and mishaps with the camera crew from her television shows Design Inc. and Sarah's House . And while she and her crew are unlikely to capture footage of roofs being sucked up by tornadoes or windows being smashed by debris, there's a good chance they'll run into a hallway mirror broken in transit or upholstery fabric not quite cut out for the room she had in mind.
"Our show is a realistic portrayal of the interior design process and we shoot live to tape, as things happen," explains Ms. Richardson, who hosts the two programs and co-produces them with long-time collaborator Michael Prini.
"There's enough that can, and does, go wrong in the design process that we don't need to fabricate a situation to create drama," adds Ms. Richardson, who also creates furniture and lends her interior design services to private clients through her Toronto company, Sarah Richardson Design. (She also writes a column in The Globe and Mail's Real Estate section.)
Her unvarnished approach to storytelling, combined with her elegantly clean design aesthetic and appealing on-camera presence, has clearly hit a sweet spot. She is a star in the competitive world of TV designers, with a hit show that attracts hundreds of thousands of viewers in Canada and around the world.
"I get tons of mail from Brazil and Italy. It's extremely rewarding for me to know that design concepts we're implementing here ... also resonate with people living in different climates and cultures."
Ms. Richardson, whose father taught architectural history at the University of Toronto and whose mother was director of parks planning and design for the city, didn't set out to be an interior designer or a TV personality. But in the mid-1990s, thanks to a friend from university who remembered her tastefully decorated student apartment, she landed a job as a set designer for a now-defunct show called Home Style , produced by Mr. Prini. There, she got a crash course in television.
"Working behind the scenes for intense, 16-hour days, I learned what went into a great TV show and what made people succeed - drive and limitless energy, and knowing how to work collaboratively as part of a creative community," says Ms. Richardson, who has a two-year-old daughter, Robin, with husband Alexander Younger.
"I still apply those same lessons to what I'm doing today."

JASON DYCK, 39, ALBERTA
Career doors opened for heart researcher
Professor and director, cardiovascular research group, department of pediatrics, University of Alberta;
Canada Research Chair and Senior scholar, Alberta Heritage Foundation for Medical Research;
Vice-president, Metabolic Modulators Research Ltd., Edmonton
BY UNNATI GANDHI
As little as two years ago, Jason Dyck never imagined he would be where he is today - director for a number of research groups, vice-president of a world-leading company in the application of novel drugs, and holding one of Canada's highly respected and coveted research chair positions.
In fact, Dr. Dyck says he has never been a big planner, preferring instead to go where he's taken.
"Sometimes your path chooses you, instead of you choosing your path. And doors open and you just have to decide whether you'll step through," says Dr. Dyck, who holds a Canada Research Chair in Molecular Biology of Heart Disease.
Doors first started to open in high school, where the Edmonton native always excelled at the sciences. But in university he "went through the not-really-knowing-what-I-wanted-to-do-as-an-undergrad phase." He took pre-entry-level courses in everything from medicine and dentistry to law and business.
Eventually, he tried a summer research position at a lab. He was so good that his supervisor suggested he apply for some external funding, and he was granted a $15,000 annual stipend. Then a professor suggested he get a PhD; after all, he was told, "you're so close."
After post-doctoral fellowships across the United States, he was drawn back to Edmonton with an offer from the University of Alberta's faculty of medicine.
In the years since, he has studied how hearts use different fuels (fats versus sugars) for energy. A key finding - "if we could regulate the metabolism of the heart we would be able to promote sugar use as opposed to fat in disease situations and that would improve function" - helped Dr. Dyck found a biotech company, Metabolic Modulators Research Ltd., in 1999.
Serendipitously, researchers have found that the drugs the company has developed for heart disease also target the hypothalamus, the part of the brain that controls appetite. The drugs can now be applied to target obesity and diabetes. "It's just like typical science - you can't really plan what's going to happen in the lab," he says, laughing.
And where does this non-planner see himself in 10 years? Surprisingly, he has an answer: "On a beach in Mexico."

UGO DIONNE, 36, QUEBEC
'Never say no' attitude and a zeal for business
President and co-owner, Synesis Inc., Montreal
BY MICHAEL RYVAL
A lawyer by training, Ugo Dionne discovered in 1998 that he was better suited to business. Indeed, he planned to obtain an MBA and become a corporate manager. Then he was introduced to Doug Wiseman.
"He's the anglophone equivalent of you," a mutual friend told him. The two hit it off and within six weeks of meeting they made an offer to purchase Synesis Inc., a company that offers specialized information technology training and recruitment services.
" 'Let's meet these people and then you can make up your mind,' Doug said to me. I said to myself, 'What have I got to lose?' " recalls Mr. Dionne, who earned his law degree at Université de Montreal and practised civil and commercial litigation for three years at Brouillette Charpentier Fortin LLP.
Becoming an entrepreneur meant assuming some risk. "You have to live with that and say, 'I accept the possibility of failure,' " says Mr. Dionne, who says he gave up law because he wasn't cut out for it.
That risk clearly paid off. Synesis, which began with one office and four employees, has emerged as the largest corporate training firm in Quebec. And it grew rapidly thanks to his "never say no" attitude, which focused on meeting client needs.
In the early days, that single-minded approach sometimes drew laughs. The firm pretended it had laptops, when in fact it had desktops with a large TV that served as a kind of mobile classroom. "We made it happen - and the client liked that," says Mr. Dionne, who is married and has two young children.
That attitude prevailed even as the firm grew to 100 teaching specialists and has evolved into teaching soft skills, such as stress management, project management and language training. Among Synesis's clients are Loto-Quebec, Hydro-Quebec and National Bank of Canada.
Synesis has also grown through acquisition. In 2006, it acquired the Multihexa training centres in Montreal and Laval. Last year, it acquired Versalys Inc., its largest competitor. It has also formed a strategic partnership with TrainCanada, a Calgary-based software and technical training firm with 25 offices across the country.
"If you are an entrepreneur and your business is going well, you can't ask for much more," says Mr. Dionne, who channels some of his passion into helping one of his pet projects, Benevoles d'affaires (Business Volunteers), which brings together business owners and non-profit groups.

ALEX RECHICHI, 34, ONTARIO
Passion for food feeds entrepreneur's success
President and chief executive officer, Extreme Brandz Inc., Mississauga, Ont.
BY MICHAEL RYVAL
Entrepreneurial by nature, Alex Rechichi and his brother Mark ran several businesses during high school. In one venture, they cleaned and sealed interlocking brick driveways, which put both through Queen's University in Kingston. Then, in 1997, they launched Extreme Pita, a fast-food chain that depends on the Middle Eastern pita for its staple.
"People get a chuckle when they hear I'm Italian. But I always had a passion for food and knew I would always run my own business," says Alex, who focused on the rapidly growing sandwich market after reading about it in Entrepreneur magazine.
"I realized how big an opportunity there was: We could set a bar in healthy dining in the sandwich category and be more focused on the fillings and less on the bread."
After eating a lot of pita sandwiches in Montreal and Toronto, and winning the support of their contractor father, Gaetano, the brothers raised $60,000 and built the first outlet in Waterloo, Ont.
For the first two years, Alex also worked in sales for an industrial supply company. In late 1998, he quit to concentrate on Extreme Pita, whose name, he says, expresses the brothers' sense of living life to the fullest. Mark, a chartered accountant, joined the company full-time a year later.
They channelled profits into new stores, and Extreme Pita has grown to more than 200 franchises in Canada and 30 in the United States. The chain differentiates itself from such competitors as Subway and Quiznos by sauteing meats and vegetables on a grill and using no cooking oil, he says.
"We are all fighting for share of stomach," he says, noting that Extreme Pita was a leader in posting nutritional information prominently. "Our promise to our customers is that we offer a wide range of great-tasting, healthy food."
Extreme Brandz, the parent company of Extreme Pita, launched its first Mucho Burrito outlet, a Mexican-style eatery, in June, 2006, in Mississauga. Today there are five locations in Ontario, one in Alberta, and 22 franchises in development.
"We are leveraging our franchise platform and a lot of the resources and relationships that we developed over the years," says Mr. Rechichi, who is married and has two young children.
"It's an opportunity to introduce a different brand that is in a similar category but is focused on a slightly higher ticket."

Full text:   THE COMPANY: SULTAN APPAREL INC. The challenge: Expand operations, without sacrificing the quality of your product: highly customized sports apparel The plan: Hire a sales force that can push your threads with key decision makers: coaches that head up men's and women's travelling teams across the U.S. The payoff: Doing what you love - full-time
If there is one thing that Fergy Neves despises, it's cookie-cutter production. The co-owner of Sultan, a Toronto-based maker of customized sports apparel focused on the basketball market, he understands the pride a personalized uniform can give players when they step on the court.
"I grew up as a shy kid," says Mr. Neves, who customizes everything, right down to the design of the lettering that goes on his jerseys. "I know what it means to come to a time in your life where you can step out and say, 'This is who I am.'"
A long-time coach, Mr. Neves started making jerseys out of necessity 20 years ago. "In Canada, basketball was pretty much a forgotten sport. There were few colours, no customized lettering or options for distinct logos or embroidery.
"It was like the companies that were in operation had a monopoly on bad design," he says.
Most of his clients are high school and university basketball teams, but the list also includes the Toronto Argonauts.
Big names aside, the profits still aren't enough to support Mr. Neves's own dream - making his passion a viable full-time pursuit. He works as a civil servant in Peel Region, while his partner, a former basketball player named Colin Poponne, is a real estate agent.
"If there was an opportunity to make a living at this, would I take it? Absolutely," says Mr. Neves. But vastly increasing sales would require a "lot of coin."
He's not willing to crank out uniforms assembly line style. Customizing uniforms is a passion, he says.
What's more, experience shows there is a niche market for highly personalized outfits, especially in the U.S., where Sultan does most of its business.
"The top teams who are travelling through the U.S. want looks that are a cut above the stock stuff on the market, something that recruiters will remember," he says, pointing to the pink Breast Cancer awareness outfits he designed for the Sultan Prospects, the high-school-level girls' team he coaches.
Mr. Neves estimates there are anywhere from 300 to 500 women's travelling teams, and more men's squads. The trick is how to access them.
Sultan gets most of its sales from coaches who have seen Sultan outfits on the court, or through direct contact with coaches Mr. Poponne knows in the U.S.
What the experts say
Detlev Zwick, an associate professor of marketing at the Schulich School of Business at York University in Toronto, is optimistic about Sultan's chances, should the partners want to expand.
"He has a different message than other manufacturers in the market. I say that because a lot of orders are coming from teams that simply see his uniforms on the court. He's also done this with little marketing or selling efforts, so that's a pretty decent start."
What Mr. Neves needs to figure out, if he wants to expand, is who the key decision makers are, and how to access them.
"He should consider hiring one or two reps in the U.S. who are present at the tournaments. That or incentivizing coaches and athletic directors at large universities to push his product as proxy sales reps. He's already selling his product without pushing, and he's too small to consider a large advertising campaign, so this seems like the best way."
Dean Hillier, a partner at the Toronto office of management consulting firm A.T. Kearney, agrees. "Between a full-time job, coaching and the needs of his family, it sounds as if Mr. Neves may already be near the limits of managing the business. I think it's time to consider hiring a limited sales force in targeted markets."
And, assuming Mr. Neves is not yet ready to leave his civil service post, he adds, "it may be time to consider hiring a business manager as well."
Both experts have different ideas about how Sultan could grow its market share. Mr. Hillier suggests that the partners increase their efforts outside basketball (in select divisions of sports like skiing and hockey, word travels fast, and children often play more than one sport), while Mr. Zwick thinks they should continue to focus on basketball, their core competency, at least for now. Both experts agree, however, that Mr. Neves needs to take a look at the production side, should he choose to expand.
"If he ramps up sales and marketing and orders spike, he has to be able to accommodate the increased numbers," says Mr. Zwick. "You only have one shot."
Therefore, he needs to have a conversation with his manufacturer, a local plant that produces his base uniforms. "His supplier may be able to accommodate his annual run of 1,000 uniforms, but will he be able to, once the number reaches 5,000? If not, he may need to consider finding someone else."
Sultan, Mr. Zwick adds, should also focus on other ways to emphasize the value of its products. "He manufactures everything locally, so he already seems to qualify for no-sweat [shop] standards," says Mr. Zwick. "I don't see this mentioned anywhere on the Sultan website, despite the fact that this is a factor that speaks to consumers' willingness to pay a price premium."
Quality is one way to maintain a price premium. But, says Mr. Zwick, he may want to investigate other value-driven criteria. "Is there any way that he can become a provider of sustainable or green athletic wear in the short- to mid-term?"
Another way to emphasize value, the experts say, is through the company's website.
"For a small company, it's a pretty good website," says Mr. Zwick, "but when a coach is directed to the website, you want to make sure that it is as easy for him or her to understand as possible. They need to understand the quality they are going to get from this company. Sultan needs to boil this down."
They could also make the site more interactive. "Adding an interactive feature that would allow a team to design its own uniform is a way of involving potential customers in his brand," says Mr. Zwick.
Offering quality services is another way to strengthen brand experience, says Mr. Hillier. "Clubs and teams are often very well organized but led by busy people, often volunteers. Samples, fittings, delivery, returns and payment options," some of which can be done on the Web, "will all help the team to focus on the sports they love - with Mr. Neves taking the hassle out of how they look."
For Mr. Neves and Mr. Poponne - two men who run a part-time business on top of their day jobs - this is a lot to think about. But Mr. Hiller says the partners don't need to do it all on their own.
"Writing out a business plan is a great way to help think through all the moving parts of their business," says Mr. Hillier. "But there is help out there should he need to plan all the details."

Full text: THE SUSPICIONS OF MR WHICHER
A Murder and the Undoing
of a Great Victorian Detective
By Kate Summerscale
Raincoast, 360 pages, $28.95
In this extraordinary book, Kate Summerscale, former literary editor of Britain's Daily Telegraph, recreates within the conventions of the country-house mystery the investigation into the Road Hill Murder, which for a time obsessed Victorian England.
Early in the morning of June 29, 1860, three-year-old Saville Kent was discovered to be missing from his parents' comfortable Georgian home near the village of Road. His body was found later that day, concealed in the vault of the servants' privy. He had been repeatedly stabbed, possibly by more than one person. Early failures by the local police in gathering evidence, and in identifying the likely killer, outraged the public and the press.
And so the renowned Jonathan Whicher, one of the first detectives in Britain, was dispatched from Scotland Yard to solve the case that would inspire Wilkie Collins and Charles Dickens. It would also destroy Whicher's career when his suspicions settled on the dead child's middle-class family. The "prince of detectives" was not himself a gentleman.
With elegance, humanity and wit, Summerscale describes a world of affluent ease, disrupted by violence and the resulting humiliation of a series of criminal inquiries. The apparently exemplary Kent family had more than one dark secret. We enter a world where servants may be spies or usurpers; where grieving parents may be odious and cruel; where children may be vicious dissemblers; where tears may indicate innocence or remorse; and where a fascinated public will believe anything in print. Without the benefits of 24-hour cable news or Internet forums, Victorian society could react to crime as hysterically as our own.
As Whicher gathers his evidence and the newspapers present theories consistent with their readers' various prejudices, clarity and truth seem more and more elusive. Motives appear confused, witnesses forgetful or deluded, possibly crucial items lost or missing. After being initially hailed as a saviour, the embodiment of scientific reasoning and forensic art, Whicher encounters hostility and official incompetence. He is forced to present his case prematurely at an inquest and, in the absence of an experienced prosecuting lawyer, the suspect escapes trial. The tale, however, does not end so quickly or so simply. Indeed, it has scarcely begun.
The murder intrigued Dickens, who wrote of his own theory in vivid and erroneous detail, and the characters involved seem themselves Dickensian in variety and improbability. Only reality or a novelist of Dickens's stature could produce Thomas Saunders, a Wiltshire magistrate who, without any legal authority whatsoever and to the great amusement of the gathered journalists, convened his own hearing at the local Temperance Hall.
Saunders summoned and berated the largely scornful citizens while taking long pulls from bottles of brandy-coloured "cold medicine," until suddenly decamping when a mysterious, note-taking stranger from London was rumoured to be part of an official inquiry into his sanity.
The story of James Willes, judge at the only court hearing into the case, merits a novel but is given here in a poignant footnote. He wept uncontrollably during sentencing and separated from his wife shortly afterward, retiring to his country estate, where he fed the fish in his streams and developed such fondness for them that he abandoned angling and forbade the sport within his grounds. Seven years later, he shot himself in the heart.
The insightful Mr. Whicher is, apart from the target of his suspicions, the most elusive character of all. Idolized for his skills and then resented for his effrontery in using them, he knew he was right even when, however rarely, he may have been wrong.
In this last respect, he differed from the haughty and infallible drug addict of Baker Street, one of his many fictional successors. After his forced retirement from the police, he too worked for a time as a private investigator and solved the question of the Tichborne Claimant, probably the strangest of all Victorian scandals and certainly the most hilarious.
The impressive research behind this book is detailed in endnotes that at times rival the main text in fascination. No breeze wafts, no crop ripens and no drunk offers pig trotters for sale of a Saturday night without ample contemporary evidence. In providing context for the mystery, Summerscale digresses gracefully into law, literature, medicine and science, on all of which she writes with authority and charm.
In the end, we are left with a probable solution, a convincing explanation; but we are also reminded that the complete truth of a real crime is far more complicated than that of a fictional puzzle. Violence may spring from perverted altruism. And the violent may in time earn redemption.
Margaret A. Gray is a Toronto lawyer with an interest in crime.

Full text: Heritage home gleams with modern charms, finds Deirdre Kelly
This Cabbagetown house was built by the man who founded Riverdale Farm, using bricks from a 19th-century factory that once rendered animals to make leather and glue.
Local contractor John O'Hara, who has built a reputation renovating quality homes in Rosedale and the Annex, purchased the heritage property from its original owner (who recently died at the age of 100) in June for $555,000. With his real-estate agent wife, Yvonne O'Hara, he is now flipping the house for close to $1-million.
The price reflects the amount of work it took to bring the house back to life. "The basement was a really nasty old cellar that I don't think had been touched since the house was built in 1906," says Mr. O'Hara, sitting in the home's new open-concept dining/living room.
Light radiates from behind his back, where a new kitchen, made of his own streamlined Shaker-style cabinetry, makes his description of the original house as "revolting" impossible to believe. But Mr. O'Hara, hammer in hand, drives the point home: "It was dark, with long narrow corridors that really just added up to a lot of wasted space."
He also moved the original staircase, replacing it with a new set of solidly built stairs that he relocated from the back to the front of the house. He finished the basement, turning it into a sun-saturated L-shaped rec room with a two-piece washroom.
Upstairs, he created a master bedroom with an en suite featuring a marble-encased bubble tub and porcelain floors.
Verdant Wellesley Park is located on the home's front doorstep. Mr. O'Hara has introduced large windows and a new front-of-house deck to maximize views of what used to be the site of Lamb's Blacking and Glue Manufactory, founded in 1848.
A fire destroyed the plant in 1910, and afterward, proprietor Daniel Lamb, a former alderman who in 1894 founded Toronto's first zoo (now Riverdale Farm), gave the land to the city to be used as a park.

Full text: For urbanites, the mall represents everything they hate about the suburbs - low-paying jobs and the people who come with them
The pending arrival of a large mall in Leslieville has drawn familiar battle lines between locals and Big Retail. The seven-hectare site that was formerly occupied by Toronto Film Studios will most likely house a $220-million development that has more than 700,000 square feet of retail, and parking for 1,900 cars.
The city has rejected the development on the grounds that the land was zoned as "employment," and retail, with its low-paying jobs, doesn't qualify. But a hearing before the Ontario Municipal Board that starts on May 21 and is scheduled to run for 12 weeks will decide the outcome.
Neighbourhood groups have resisted the development, citing the increase in traffic and air pollution, and what they feel is an unimaginative and unproductive use of the land.
The developer, the emphatically named Smart!Centres Inc. (the company's formal name), says that this isn't a big-box development and doesn't mimic the sprawling Power Centres, SmartCentres and Wal-Mart super centres that loom in the suburbs like the doomed heads of Easter Island. The model submitted to the OMB shows two- and three-storey red-brick façades with a generous pedestrian corridor, though it may be anchored by the devil itself, Wal-Mart. Titled the "Foundry District Lifestyle Centre," it is a stealth mall.
The financial argument in its favour is that it is a huge capital investment that will create 2,100 full- and part-time jobs and contribute at least $4-million annually in property taxes. And this at a time when the city is famously broke.
The debate has been framed in terms of community and money, but at the heart is the nature of malls themselves.
'TWO KINDS OF MALLS'
Malls are like nuclear warheads, each one created to counteract one that already exists, and if possible, destroy it, or render it obsolete. Their evolution is partly social and cultural, and is glimpsed in comedian Chris Rock's observation: "There's two kinds of malls. The one where the white people shop, and the one where they used to shop."
The mall where they used to shop may end up being Gerrard Square, several blocks north of the Leslieville project. For a number of years, I lived nearby, an area that was "in transition," as the real-estate agents say. It featured a mix of gentrifying young couples, a resident ethnic melange of Asians, Blacks, Sikhs and Turks, as well as combustible porch-sitting hillbillies, the residue of the white working class that occupied the area for decades.
Ten years ago, Gerrard Square was anchored by Simpsons and Zellers and there were a few chains, but there were also independent stores, and an ever-changing market filled with carts selling off-brand vegetable dicers, perfumes that were a syllable away from greatness (Entity, Obsessed), jeans by, yes, Galvin Klein, discount ceramics, and stuffed animals trapped in balloons. A man occasionally sold meat out of a gym bag near the mall entrance. On the weirdness scale, only the Dufferin Mall could touch it. But it was a fair reflection of the neighbourhood.
As the area gentrified and the disused factories converted to lofts, Gerrard Square began to reflect that change. A Home Depot arrived, along with Staples and Winners, and the mall underwent an expensive renovation. The guy with the gym bag moved on.
But it is a fragile alliance between mall and neighbourhood. Stores continue to come and go. The siren bargains of Wal-Mart will lure some shoppers south certainly, and Gerrard Square could retreat to its eclectic Third Worldism, a casualty.
TRAGIC FLAW
Every retail concept is born with a tragic flaw that eventually kills it. At the time that Toronto's first mall - Eglinton Square - was built in 1953, there were still 500 Fuller Brush men working Ontario. Somewhere, an idea is already hatching to kill the unbuilt SmartCentres, kill its ersatz streetscape and two-for-one sales, its cute tops and discount jeans. What then?
In The Harvard Design School Guide to Shopping , a collection of essays edited by the Dutch architect Rem Koolhaus, the mall is a preoccupation. "Rather than shopping (as an activity) taking place in the city (as a place)," writes John McMorrough, "the city (as an idea) takes place within shopping (as a place)."
In a time of declining church attendance, suburban sprawl, perilous school drop-out rates, ethnic balkanization, and a diluted notion of citizenship (the last Ontario election drew 52.6 per cent of voters, a record low; 22 per cent of Canadians believe "Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness" is Canada's constitutional slogan), shopping has become the most visible organizing principle of the suburbs; it has become a place. It is more binding than nationalism and more seductive than sex (45 per cent of South African women polled preferred shopping to sex, with only 26 per cent preferring the opposite).
Part of the opposition to the Leslieville development is that an inherently suburban idea, an idea that is decaying within a larger unsustainable idea - the suburbs themselves - is being imported to an urban site. The East Toronto Community Coalition views the mall not as a viable employment opportunity, but a perpetuation of the existing underclass. There is a fear that the film industry, with its higher-paying jobs, will eventually flee the area. There is something of a class division between those who want bargains, and possibly employment from the proposed mall, and those who want higher-paying and more creative businesses (the original zoning was for creative employment). Leslieville is a community that contains both wealth and poverty, and Wal-Mart, in whatever form, is associated as a force for the latter.
A study by University of Toronto researchers found that Toronto's core was becoming increasingly affluent and white, while the surrounding suburbs were getting poorer and more diverse. The middle-class, which made up the demographic majority at the time the first malls were built, is disappearing. In 1970, 66 per cent of Torontonians were defined as middle income. In 2000 the figure was less than half that - 32 per cent. In the same period, low and very low income went from 19 per cent to a disturbing 50 per cent. What this means for Toronto's suburban malls is an increasingly diverse clientele with fewer financial resources.
Urban malls don't have a brilliant success rate. The exception is the Eaton Centre, which claims to be the city's largest tourist attraction, with 50 million visitors annually. But the Leslieville SmartCentre isn't the Eaton Centre. Despite thoughtful concessions to the site, its soul is suburban, and its fate may be as well.
The ideal mall
What would the ideal urban mall look like? It would be located at a public transit hub, and the sprawl that comes from the vast parking space - one of the great attractions of the mall - could be alleviated by parking garages or putting some of it underground (the Leslieville project is on a brownfield site where the soil contamination doesn't allow for underground parking).
It would be sustainable. There would be a green roof that helps defray solar heat gain and consume rainwater. Inside would be a wall of living plants that acts as a bio-filter and helps reduce air-conditioning costs. Geo-thermal borehole technology could be used to deliver sustainable energy through a series of shafts that store heat during summer and dispense it during winter. The additional cost of the technology would likely be paid for in energy savings within a decade or so.
The mall would also be more diverse than current versions. Chain stores are inevitable, providing consumer recognition and comfort, and for the developer, a known financial quantity. But there is room for diversity. (A farmer's market would be a natural feature, especially in the suburbs, where malls sit on what was once farmland.)
In the centre, between the boulevards, occupying the space that is traditionally used for parking, there could be season-round recreational facilities: A hockey rink, soccer field, baseball diamond, a dog park, a venue for cultural activities.
Is this a naive reverie, a napkin sketch masking as an urban plan? Of course it is. In the optimistic computer-generated model used to sell the plan, there would be ethnic couples sitting at the sidewalk cafes, children playing soccer cheered on by their parents, and families strolling with shopping bags.
But will the children play soccer there? Will the parents come to watch them, or are they too busy working two minimum-wage jobs (possibly at the mall itself)? Who would control the green space at night? Would the Cineplex and restaurants keep a critical mass of people on the property in the evenings?
The Leslieville site plan is admirably progressive: The buildings will be LEED-certified, the businesses diverse (hopefully) and scaled to the neighbourhood. There is a grey-water system that recycles and distributes water onsite. But there is also an impact on air pollution and traffic congestion, and an inconvenience to the bicycle path along Lake Shore Boulevard. If they don't build, however, what will go there? In the short term, nothing.
The question is, what will this development look like in a decade, or in two decades? What if the film business atrophies, and neighbouring studio Cinespace attempts something similar (it expressed an interest in re-zoning but is currently prevented from doing so)? As Hollywood North goes south (and east and west), could this area eventually be re-zoned to become an unbroken line of malls and big-box developments that extend for blocks, 40 hectares of retail sprawl that mimics the massive contiguous malls of Scarborough or Mississauga?
Ambitious plans for diversity (a design studio, professional offices, independent retail) could dissolve under harsh economic conditions. In 2015 there could be a Wal-Mart anchoring some dollar stores and a No Frills store.
The mall was conceived 50 years ago as a way to bring order and convenience to the hopeful suburbs. The suburbs are no longer hopeful, and the mall, unfairly or otherwise, is in danger of becoming a symbol of encroaching Third Worldism. What people are protesting is not necessarily what it is, but what it represents. They fear the man selling meat from a gym bag.

Full text: Historic trulli lure eager renovators; 'Our kids thought we were crazy'
In Puglia, at the heel of the Italian boot, a centuries-old architectural peculiarity has turned into an unlikely real-estate boom.
To the locals, the trulli - the cone-roofed structures that dot the countryside - are a reminder of the region's humble past. The most basic trulli are one-room, round huts constructed of stacked, dry stones, which form walls and a simple vaulted cone roof. They date back to as early as the 14th century, and most housed peasants or livestock - or both. Dimensions are snug: The average cone is slightly bigger than a four-person camping tent. Many lack necessities, such as running water or toilets.
But to a growing number of British, Dutch and Germans, they are the ideal fixer-upper. "Our kids thought we were crazy," says Stephen Snooks, who moved from Derby, England, to a 300-year-old trullo (from the Greek troulos or tholos, meaning dome) about four years ago. "They couldn't believe we were going to live in it."
Mr. Snooks first saw a picture of a trullo on the Internet, then headed to Puglia with his wife to see what they were all about. To them the trullo was romantic, it was steeped in history and it was a property they could fix up. It reminded them of the cone-shaped oast houses in the English countryside that were used for drying hops for beer. They also fell in love with the region and the simple way of life they could have in Puglia, where people still take siestas in the afternoons and Sundays are for relaxing.
They laid down a deposit on a five-cone trullo - each room has its own cone-shaped roof - on about two acres that cost a total of EUR57,000 ($89,300). Three months later they moved to the small town of Martina Franca and lived out of their camper while they gave the trullo a thorough cleaning and installed a bathroom. "I thought, 'I need my bloody kitchen,'" says Mr. Snooks's wife, Jo Waters, but after sinking another EUR30,000 into renovations after moving in, she says she got used to life in a trullo. The renovations included connecting a power line for electricity, and repairing the pump for a rainwater tank to provide water for the bathroom. (They bring in bottled drinking water.) They also added appliances to the kitchen and painted inside and out.
There are about 5,000 trulli in various states of disrepair scattered among the olive groves and prickly pear cacti in the Valle d'Itria, on the strip of land flanked by the Adriatic and the Ionian seas. Stone was plentiful in the area, and according to local legend, the trulli were built without mortar so they could be quickly disassembled into a pile of bricks when the tax collector came. About 1,400 of them are located in the town of Alberobello, designated a UNESCO World Heritage site because of the structures.
During the 20th century, the trulli were abandoned by their owners, who fled to the city in search of modern conveniences. Some were used as occasional country homes by locals, while some of the larger ones were turned into rustic country inns or restaurants.
Then, foreigners started coming. About five years ago, low-cost airlines, such as Ryanair, began ferrying people to nearby Bari from Frankfurt and London. Visitors were intrigued by the oddly shaped structures, many with Christian or astrological symbols painted on their roofs.
Sensing opportunity, local real-estate firms started advertising in British magazines, and pushing the trullo as a unique country-home investment. Pietro D'Amico, who owns a local property firm, says he sold 200 trulli to British buyers last year, a 10 per cent increase from the year before.
The recent trulli boom is partly a continuation of the foreign-fueled real-estate speculation that began in Tuscany several decades ago, where so many British began buying second homes that it was given the nickname Chiantishire. As the values of country homes in Tuscany soared, the more adventurous wandered into nearby regions such as Umbria, and then farther south to the Marche and Abruzzo, buying up abandoned farmhouses or run-down villas. Puglia is the end of the line.
"These are properties that are still affordable, in spite of the soaring real-estate prices in Italy," says Lucia Bruno, an architect whose company helps restore trulli.
While a trullo might be cheaper than a Tuscan farmhouse, prices have risen in recent years. Today, unrestored trulli with three cones go for around EUR80,000, an increase of about 30 per cent from five years ago, according to Mr. D'Amico. The cost of fixing one up has also surged. Adding the basics - bathroom, kitchen and electricity - can cost at least another EUR80,000, he says.
Gregory Snegoff, of California, was living in Rome for several years but grew tired of its big-city chaos and, along with his wife, decided to move to the country. The actor/director first learned about Puglia and its trulli from friends. He initially rented a trullo and then decided to buy one in the small town of Ceglie Messapica, where they have lived for four years.
"For us, it's wonderful," says Mr. Snegoff, who bought a one-cone trullo and another small structure, which sit on six acres, for EUR25,000. "We are interested in a self-sustaining way of life where we can eat the fruit and vegetables we grow and enjoy the peace and tranquility of the country."
As more foreigners have bought trulli, businesses have popped up to service them. Ms. Bruno, who is from Turin and now lives in a restored trullo powered by solar panels, heads a small firm called Trullishire (after Tuscany's Chiantishire) which tries to help foreigners find qualified local craftsmen and offers assistance in navigating the thicket of red tape that comes with restoring a trullo. Trulli have to be restored in accordance with strict building-code and planning regulations, which can be a tangled bureaucratic process. Common requests that are denied include enlarging or adding to the trulli's small windows, or adding sunrooms or expansions using wood or terra cotta.
There are a few new trulli owners who have pushed the envelope, turning what was once a humble abode into a luxury residence. Ms. Bruno is handling the construction management of a five-bedroom, three-bathroom trullo, with an under floor heating system powered by solar energy, for a London resident. It will also feature a 16½ -foot-by-26¼ -foot in-ground pool. The owner paid EUR90,000 for the trullo but is spending EUR300,000 on the restoration and expansion, says Ms. Bruno. It took more than a year and several revisions of plans to get a building permit, Ms. Bruno says.

Full text: TALASA
DEVELOPER: Cambri Development Group
PRICE: Starting at $99,900
SIZE: 385 sq. ft. to 1,100 sq. ft.
SALES CENTRE: 1090 Sun Rivers Drive, Kamloops (opening soon)
CONTACT: 877-514-4344 or www.talasaliving.com
Monday marked the unveiling of Talasa, a $150-million village centre slated for Kamloops.
"Talasa is the first new village centre for this area in generations," says Darryl Caunt of the Cambri Development Group.
"It's modelled after successful village centres from across the world, with homes, shops, dining options, services and recreation all on the doorstep."
Once completed, Talasa will offer more than 2,000 homes, restaurants, retail services and a 12,000-square-foot amenity building, centred around the Sun Rivers Golf Course.
"It's a village centre, so that appeals to a broad range of people who want to walk to shops, dining and services as well as having a golf course on their doorstep and amazing views," says Mr. Caunt.
"Because we've master-planned the entire village centre from scratch, we can make sure it ticks all the boxes."
With prices starting below $100,000, Talasa is offering some of the most affordable housing in Western Canada.
"From the beginning we have aimed to make resort-quality living accessible to a much wider marketplace than is typically available," says Mr. Caunt.
"Kamloops, and Sun Rivers specifically, offered us this opportunity to feature an unparalleled lifestyle without the high price points in most resort communities."
Many are forecasting an economic boom in Kamloops over the next five years and Mr. Caunt hopes Talasa will bring "much-needed" new homes to the area.
"As a market analyst, I am seeing more and more people move to Kamloops every month," says Jennifer Podmore, market analyst and managing partner of MPC Intelligence. "The pace and style of life is increasingly appealing to buyers, not only from B.C. but right across Canada," she says.
"The local economy is creating opportunities which are fuelling migration to the area and this trend is forecasted to continue."
However, this may soon lead to price increases for the Kamloops market. "Given the buzz around the real estate market in Kamloops, which is probably the last major undervalued market in B.C., our window to offer high-quality homes from under $100,000 will be brief," says Mr. Caunt.
For now, "Talasa is the chance to buy resort-style living affordably, with the quality of finish you'd expect from a high-end golf course development," he says.

Full text: A DAILY MISCELLANY OF INFORMATION BY MICHAEL KESTERTON
Green worries
* For people who feel an acute unease about the future of the planet, a small but growing number of psychotherapists now offer a treatment designed to reduce worries as well as carbon footprints: ecopsychology. "Global warming has added an extra layer of anxiety to what people are already feeling," Sandy Shulmire of Portland, Ore., a psychologist and practitioner of ecopsychology, told The New York Times. Therapists like her use several techniques, such as encouraging patients besieged by multi-tasking to spend more time outdoors and exploring how they approach the natural world. The International Community for Ecopsychology (ecopsychology.org) lists more than 120 therapists from Alaska to Uruguay. Colleges in Europe and the United States offer courses in the field.
* "Toronto therapist Grace Ross, a practitioner in the growing field of ecopsychology, says many of us suffer from some degree of anxiety because we're saddened by the sorry state of the world and feel disconnected from it," Dana Tye Rally writes in More magazine. "To treat this affliction, Ross, 53, encourages her ecoanxious patients (mostly urban women) to take part in her guided wilderness retreats to nearby Algonquin forests." The retreats may involve shedding inhibitions by venturing off solo to talk to trees. She says participants return with a renewed desire to fuss less about eating genetically modified fruits, and to focus more on planting trees in their backyards or joining a local environmental group.
Green eating
U.S. consumers are scrambling to find ways to cope with rising food prices, The Washington Post reports. "We are in shocking new territory," said Todd Hale, senior vice-president of consumer shopping and insights at Nielsen Consumer Panel Services. "With the exception of the very affluent, everyone is looking to save by altering where they shop, how they shop and the brands they buy." One thing consumers haven't skimped on are organic products. Over the past year, organic food and beverage sales jumped to $4.3-billion (U.S.), according to Nielsen. Many shoppers who prefer organic are finding other ways to cut back rather than give up products they think are healthier and better for the environment.
Green schooling
"For parents who obsessively green every aspect of their tykes' lives, there's a bit of good news: A new organic preschool, Le Petit Paradis, is accepting students for the fall," New York magazine says. The private city school "is currently being redone with environmentally friendly wall paints, bamboo floors and low-flow toilets. Even the puzzles will be made of wood, not plastic." Annual tuition of $12,995 (U.S.) includes French immersion.
How to talk to wrinklies
In his career guide for the younger generation, Whoa, My Boss is Naked! , author Jake Greene observes:
* "Our generation has grown so accustomed to mallspeak that we have very little perspective on how obnoxious it is for other/older people to listen to. I don't care how talented, qualified or personable you are; your chances of landing a cool job and accelerating up the food chain diminish significantly if you talk like Phoebe from Friends or the cast of The O.C .
* "When you are talking with an older person and he/she forces contemporary slang into the conversation, that's a very good sign. It means that he/she views you as the 'cooler' vs. simply the 'younger' party. That is a major status distinction."
A dirty trick
"Doug Kelley was perplexed when Craigslist ads for his Sacramento carpet-cleaning business started disappearing from the popular website. Every time he reposted one of his classified ads, it would vanish - often within minutes," writes Mark Melnicoe of The Sacramento (Calif.) Bee. "After competitors' ads started showing up, some of them openly denigrating his company, West Coast Carpet Care, Kelley knew he had a problem." The businessman had stumbled onto a little-known dark side of Craigslist: flagging. "Using conventional software to circumvent Craigslist rules, some individuals have figured out how to quash competition by removing ads of their rivals, whether they're house-cleaning services or real-estate sellers. Craigslist employs an automatic tool that yanks offensive or false ads if enough different users flag them. The problem: Single users can cheat the system with software that makes the flagging appear to be from multiple users."
Spot the error
Recently, a man in Fort Worth, Tex., was arrested after he tried to cash a cheque for $360-billion (U.S.). Bank employees became suspicious when they saw the 10 zeros in the sum and called the account's owner. She said the suspect, Charles Ray Fuller, 21, was her daughter's boyfriend and he did not have permission to take the cheque or to cash it. Mr. Fuller was arrested for suspicion of fraud and also charged with unlawfully carrying a weapon and possession of marijuana. While inside a patrol car, police say, the man claimed he was starting his own record label and had been given the money by his girlfriend's mother to help him
start it.

Full text: Reference covers the cottage basics, from critters to controlling erosion to caring for your pet
THE COTTAGE BIBLE
BY GERRY MACKIE
AND LAURA ELISE TAYLOR
BOSTON MILLS PRESS
360 PAGES
$39.95
Plenty of people have purchased an idyllic lakeside retreat only to find that relaxing on the dock with a good book is for the guests - the owners are too busy scraping, painting, pulling weeds and trying to get the septic tank fixed.
The Cottage Bible by Gerry Mackie and Laura Elise Taylor attempts to prepare prospective buyers for ownership and help owners head off some of the surprises before they happen.
The book provides a how-to guide for buying a property and keeping it up and running afterward.
In getting to know your lake, the authors advise buyers to know about the origin of the lake, its anatomy, nutrient base, physical attributes and water quality.
City dwellers may not know that lakes have hot and cold spots, swimmer's itch, beaver fever, snapping turtles, leeches, bloodsuckers and tangled mats of weedy plants lurking under the surface.
Other topics include managing septic tanks, controlling your wake in a speedboat, and what to do about shoreline erosion.
If your breakwater is on its last legs, consider it the perfect opportunity to remove it and restore your shoreline to its natural state, the authors suggest.
"The erosion of your lake's shoreline is the natural consequence of water and wave action over time, a process you will not conquer, no matter how much concrete you pour or what kind of barriers you create.
Fortunately, your shoreline has its own built-in erosion control: the plants, shrubs and trees that live at the water's edge.
The roots of the natural vegetation hold the soil of the shoreline together, as well as contributing to the rich community of aquatic and land organisms that inhabit this eco-zone.
When you clear out this vegetation, you are not only destroying the ecological balance, you are putting your valuable property at risk of becoming lake-fill.
The how-to sections of the book include instructions for building a dock and winterizing your boat and motor.
The critters that city dwellers may not be acquainted with include weasels, martens, muskrats, river otters, wolverines, beavers, porcupines, shrews, moles, voles, bears and bats.
Then there's the redbelly snake, Northern water snake and Eastern Massasauga rattlesnake to contend with. The authors have helpful advice for avoiding a bite: Do not reach under rocks or logs.
The book is filled with more than 1,000 photographs, and many diagrams and drawings.
Should your unfortunate golden retriever have a bad outcome in a porcupine sighting, for example, a detailed drawing shows how to remove the quills.
Covering the dog's eyes before pulling out the quills should help to keep your pet's panic under control, the authors recommend.
If you are handy, you will enjoy keeping up your cottage yourself, the authors point out.
"If you are not handy, you will either learn to be handy or enjoy cottage life with deep pockets and a good list of local tradespeople."
The book makes great cautionary reading for anyone considering a cottage purchase. It's also full of solid advice for even experienced cottagers.
And even for the old salts who know it all, The Cottage Bible is the perfect coffee-table tome.
Weekend guests who pick it up and leaf through will appreciate - if they didn't already - just how much work their hosts have undertaken to provide that cherished getaway.

Full text: I spent the good part of a beautiful Sunday afternoon attempting to make my laundry room a bit more palatable. It's now a bit tidier but still completely lacklustre.
I have one of those laundry rooms from the good old days before creating chic spaces for washing clothes was de rigueur in every home renovation.
When we moved into our home many years ago, we figured a new tile floor and paint job would do the trick for ours. Wrong!
I have loathed this space for years, ever since I started creating fresh, inspiring and pretty laundry lairs for my clients. On Sunday, I decided it's time to tackle my troublesome "fluff 'n' fold" and create something more stylish.
To get my creative juices flowing, I dug up some photos of a great space I created for an expectant mom last spring (as a surprise for when she returned from hospital with three babies. I figured that with three tiny bundles, there was apt to be plenty of loads of laundry in her future.
We were on a tight timeline and really tight budget, so my goal was to get the maximum impact for the minimum investment of design dollars. With a little creativity, we were able to deliver on both of these goals.
Now it's time for me to take my own advice and make my laundry lab a little more chic. I will be following the ideas I applied to my client's project last year.
***
Some design ideas
GO BEYOND BASIC WHITE
A room can feel clean and fresh in shades other than stark white. Having seen one too many spa-inspired laundry spaces, I wanted a look that was a little richer in hue. For my client's space, I opted for a sand and sea palette of silvery blues and café au lait neutrals. (If you are tending triplets, I can only assume you need your surroundings to be as serene as possible!)
Feel free to break with tradition and pick any colour combination that lifts your spirits and makes the mundane routine of laundry a bit less of a chore.
TAKE A CUE FROM APPLIANCES
Gone are the days when the only colour choice for washing machines was white. Today, you can get just about any colour, including red, mint green, ice blue, cobalt, black, silver and pewter. There is no excuse for this functional space to be lacking in colour and decorative punch. I chose metallic blue in keeping with my ocean-inspired theme.
DO AS THE EUROPEANS DO
North Americans have been a bit slow in catching up to our European friends with the whole front-loading washing machine concept, but it seems we've finally realized it's a good idea to go for the appliance design that uses less water, less detergent and is gentler on fine washables. But in addition to those benefits, front-loaders also enable you to run a continuous counter right over your machines, creating much-desired folding space.
SHOP AROUND FOR CABINETRY
I was feeling thrifty (okay, okay ... cheap) when I went looking to fulfill my storage needs, so I decided to limit my selections to in-stock cabinet options that were also on sale. I happened upon a toasty wheat faux bead board door profile that suited my scheme perfectly.
When shopping for off-the-rack cabinetry, be sure to consider the variety of door sizes available. I used a combination of glass front, standard height and above-the-refrigerator cabinets to compartmentalize my storage in a pleasing pattern.
IMAGINATIVE COUNTERS
I knew I couldn't afford to have a custom floating shelf made but wanted an open area to stack freshly folded clothes. I bought two runs of countertop and cut the depth of one in half, then mounted it to the underside of the tallest cabinets and ran it from side to side. The counters have a sleek, square-edge profile with an aluminum facing that picks up the steely details on the appliances.
PREPARE TO MAKE A SPLASH
It's not really necessary to install a backsplash in the laundry, but for a few extra dollars, it can look great.
I found icy blue glass mosaics and tumbled travertine stone accents at my local big-box store and created a pattern to mimic the effect of the horizon where sand meets sea and sky. For an eight-foot run of counter, you'll need only 12 square feet of tile to create this effect (and at an average price of $15 a square foot it only added $180 to the budget).
GO TO THE BAR FOR HELP
I have no time for washing things by hand, so a huge laundry sink isn't a priority in my design.
My favourite solution for a clean-up sink in the laundry is a 21-inch round bar sink that is easy to install, well-priced and, best of all, cool looking. What I save by choosing a simple sink I tend to splurge on a good single-lever faucet with a pull-down spray (which comes in handy if you are trying to fill a bucket to mop up a mess made by a little one).
TEXTURIZE AND ACCESSORIZE
My sea-related look needed some cottage touches to finish it off.
A bamboo blind, linen-lined rattan laundry hampers, a classic striped woven cotton runner, and a long hook board all bring home the easy, breezy look of casual seaside style.
DON'T BE LEFT IN THE DARK
The laundry is likely the last place you'd spend a lot on a great-looking light fixture, but that doesn't mean you have to go without!
I wanted to add the look of luxe and found a brushed-nickel fixture for less than $100. With five chandelier bulbs, it ensures the room is always sparkly and bright, and who doesn't need a touch of glam when tackling one of life's more mundane chores?

Full text: Detached homes on big lots lose their shine, but some chaff at new rules; no cigars on the pool deck
The U.S. second-home market is in a slump. But one type of vacation property is still showing signs of life: condos.
A new U.S. National Association of Realtors study estimates that sales of vacation homes in 2007 fell 31 per cent, to 740,000, from 2006. But sales of condos declined only slightly - 2.8 per cent - while sales of detached houses dropped 38 per cent. The upshot is that condos cornered a substantially larger share of the U.S. vacation-home market last year: 29 per cent, up from 21 per cent in 2006.
Condos are selling better than single-family vacation houses for a number of reasons.
They don't require their owners to maintain lawns, trim shrubs, paint the exteriors or replace roofs - increasingly important concerns to an aging population.
Condo communities also tend to offer amenities such as pools and clubhouses. And condos usually are cheaper to buy, and easier to resell, than houses.
Yet the prices of U.S. vacation condos haven't held up. Median prices fell almost 10 per cent to $180,000 (U.S.) last year from the year before, while prices of single-family second homes remained flat, the real estate association says.
Part of that decline reflects the general downturn in the country's housing market, but the price pressure on condos also comes from investors who bought units in resort markets during the real estate boom and now are trying to get rid of them.
While the price-cutting is bad news for existing condo owners, it can make the units seem like relative bargains to buyers compared with houses.
North Carolina residents Tod Phelps and his wife, Shelly, are among the second-home buyers attracted to condos. Since 2001, the couple have owned a three-bedroom second home on Beech Mountain, N.C., a 2½-hour drive from their primary home in Greensboro.
But Mr. Phelps, an information technology executive, says he is tired of spending weekends cleaning gutters and painting doors, and paying at least $3,000 a year to have people mow the lawn, weed flowerbeds and plow the drive in winter.
"I didn't expect it to be as much trouble as it was," he says. Now the couple plan to sell the house and replace it with a "ski-in, ski-out" condo in the same community.
Condos are also making inroads in vacation spots where they've rarely been seen before, including beach villages along Lake Michigan. Some of these are attracting a new type of buyer used to an urban environment.
Mary Morrissey, a government policy consultant in Chicago, and her husband recently bought a $350,000, two-bedroom loft at the Vineyards, a converted winery in Harbert, Mich. It features such downtown design elements as concrete fireplaces and window seats, exposed ductwork and soaring ceilings.
The unit is much more open, light and fun than the usual cramped cottages found in the area, Ms. Morrissey says, and the contemporary style was the main reason they were attracted to it.
"We never even thought about buying a single-family home," she adds.
And in some places, such as Hawaii, prices have risen so high in recent years that condos are the only viable choice for many buyers.
Maui broker Georgina Hunter says $1-million buys a two-bedroom condo in a resort with golf, pool and fitness centre, but isn't enough money for a single-family home.
Because acquisition costs are so high, many buyers look to rent out their places when they're not vacationing there. In Hawaii, condos also have the edge: local zoning allows most condos to be rented for a short period, while most houses must be rented for at least 180 days.
"You just get more bang for your buck," Ms. Hunter says.
But condos aren't popular in every second-home area.
In New York's Hamptons, people prefer detached houses because they offer a yard, extra rooms and privacy - "exactly what New Yorkers often lack in their primary residences," says Rick Hoffman, east end regional vice-president for Corcoran Group real estate brokers.
Condo living also can require an attitude adjustment as owners contend with close-by neighbours and live under a condo association's rules. Wayne Zawila, a futures trader in Orlando, Fla., paid $619,000 a little over a year ago for a three-bedroom weekend getaway in Daytona Beach.
He thought the fourth-floor condo would be more secure and easier to manage than the lakefront house he used to own in Galena, Ill., which he once drove to at 3 a.m. because he was worried the pipes had frozen.
But though condo life can be more carefree, at least when it comes to security and exterior maintenance, it's not rules-free. Mr. Zawila sometimes chafes under communal regulations he hasn't had to deal with before, such as the one that bans him from smoking cigars while lounging in the pool.
"It drives me nuts," he says.
Because many affluent second-home buyers like the common ownership and upkeep of exterior elements but still want a detached house, some builders are combining them in "condo homes."
That setup attracted Sue Anne Davidson-Kalkus, a retired antiques dealer in Rome, Ga., and her husband, Tony, a retired army colonel, who married last year.
A few months ago, they listed her four-bedroom vacation retreat on four hectares on Lookout Mountain, Ga., for $1-million and started searching for an easy-care vacation condo in the $600,000 range in New England, nearer to Mr. Kalkus's grown children.
But after owning a custom-built place, Mrs. Davidson-Kalkus found the apartment-style condos she looked at to be "very ordinary."
So the couple has just inked a deal to buy a detached, two-bedroom condo home at Winnapaug Cottages, a 14-hectare development in Westerly, R.I.
Their $300-a-month homeowner's fee covers landscaping, garbage collection, snow removal and exterior maintenance.
"This is the best of both worlds," she says.

LISTING AGENT: Bill Thom, Re/Max Realtron Realty Inc.
This semi-detached, five-level back-split contains three separate units, agent Bill Thom says, each with its own entrance.
"It's ideal for [earning] income or [accommodating] extended families or in-laws," Mr. Thom adds.
Improvements made to the home, which was built in the early 1970s, include a new roof, windows and air-conditioning system.
In addition to living and sleeping areas, each unit has a bathroom and a kitchen with a fridge and stove.
The main suite is entered through the front door, which opens to a combined living and dining room with hardwood flooring and a walkout to a balcony. This level also contains an eat-in kitchen with ceramic floors and backsplashes. Three bedrooms are situated on the upper floor, overlooking the backyard.
The second unit is directly below that level. With a family room and one bedroom, it can be accessed from a side door.
Next to the built-in garage, a door leads into a shared laundry room and the third unit, which occupies the basement and has three bedrooms.
Local amenities include schools, shops and a community centre. A GO Train station, buses to two subway lines, and major thoroughfares are nearby.
